SirNuke,prisonarchitect,1390635739.0,"Interesting video, but I can't help to feel that the core issue is the Kotaku editorial takes the game far more serious than the developers.  Prison Architect is, in my mind, a Dungeon Keeper/Evil Genius style management game stylized around prisons as depicted in Shawshank Redemption and pop culture.  Shawshank Redemption doesn't really make that much of a stance about prisons/the US judicial system to be honest, and Prison Architect doesn't either.

Games can make interesting social statements, but that doesn't meant they do."

Corbenik,Games,1390636390.0,"I know that you have some problems with CoM, but I'm just going to gush a bit. Is that okay? Yeah, that's okay. I don't need your permission.

Okay, so the card system. Pretty clearly designed for a handheld system. Not really the best. Fun and playable but it turns the game into a grindfest and has a clear set of auto-win decks. This is basically my only problem with this game.

Everything else is great. You see, when taken out of the series and put on its own, CoM is a fascinating exploration of a teenage kid slowly losing his mind. Everytime he explores a world his memories practically *scream* at him to turn back, to take this magic potion that will fix everything, to do anything other than proceed. And he refuses it, mostly for bullshit reasons. This is the only KH game where we actually get to see Sora get *angry.* Not frustrated or depressed or a little sad because he didn't save Kairi. He gets pissed. And I love it.

I'm gonna cut the comment short, because I need to go to sleep, but this is the only game in the series where you can psychoanalyze the shit out of pretty much every event. Donald and Goofy are the id and super-ego, respectively, and the cricket fills his role as Sora's conscious. And it all goes to shit with Sora (the ego) fucking lost it.

And then we get to Riku's story, in which the artists did an amazing job in not compromising their message so that the players can feel good about themselves.

Of course, in the context of the series it does serve as one big monkey wrench. But I'm happy that they made it.

TeHokioi,AskMen,1390636500.0,"Glad to hear things are better for you than they were for me. It sounds to me as though he's similar to how I am - I have real trouble asking someone out, yet will happily talk for hours when I have something to talk about. 

Again, I don't want to make false assumptions that could affect the situation, but it sounds to me as though he really enjoys your company, but doesn't want to take it further for fear of rejection and losing what he has. I've had times when I consider asking someone out, but play the hundreds of situations through my head in which she rejects me and then I lose my friendship with her because of it. The most recent girl that I asked out (and the one with whom the aforementioned situation cost me a relationship with) I was only able to ask out because we didn't have much to do with each other at that point. We'd been on a trip to Japan together through school and were really close there, but I barely saw her since. Instead of playing the situations in which I lose a friendship, I reasoned that the worst case scenario was that she could say no, and things would remain as they were. So in that case, I was already living the worst case scenario and would be if I didn't say anything.

But in a scenario like this, the worst case scenario that I play through my head is much worse. If I ask out a girl that I'm really good friends with, there is potential for the whole friendship to be ruined and for us to never speak again. I've seen that play out several times with my own friends, and often I'm caught in the middle when it gets ugly (again, people refusing to respect the decisions of others). And in my case, I often reason that the potential consequences outweigh the potential gains, and that I'd prefer to stay really close friends than lose it all for a chance to go further. 

I think this is probably the worst possible thing I could be saying in the scenario, playing through scenarios of rejection and whatnot, all the while somehow using this as a quasi-confessional. Sorry if it freaks you out or whatever, it sounds like he really values your friendship at the very least. Sometimes it's just hard to make a real move, even though you talk for hours virtually. "

Kamins0d,malefashionadvice,1390636688.0,"Preliminary questions:
Have you been down that weight before, and just gone up? If so, do you know your measurements at wedding target weight? If so, go off of that IF you can manage to cut 15 by march. And don't assume you can, because a suit too small will be worse than one slightly too big (IMO).

If you haven't ever been at target wedding weight,  have you been on a prolonged cut? Is it going well? If so see below. If not, then realistically gauge if your goal is too ambitious, and identify what's more important/feasible to you: perfect fitting-suit-but-slightly-out-of-shape, or slightly-ill-fitting-suit-but-in-shape? 

Having fluctuated a lot in my weight, 15 pounds doesn't make a difference when you're 250+, but if you're under 250 then every 15 makes a noticable difference, especially in the jacket, and shoulders (for me). Having been in the situation your best bet is to work out hard now and buy a suit closer to the day. Maybe even go off the rack instead of Indochino if you plan on losing weight up til the wedding day. That, or consign yourself to not wearing a perfect fit on the big day."

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1390636733.0,"Honestly... I don't think so. This isn't just me being cynical here or whatever. You guys never had a solid foundation to work with. The only way you guys could have survived a betrayal of trust so early on in the relationship is if it was a one time thing. The fact that it was continual *and* it involved your ex just makes it so severe. She opened herself up again and again to get hurt, and whenever you had that same choice to make you choice the cowardly way out (like you said before). In order to get her back she would have to open herself up *again.* 

Honestly I don't think this is something she'll get over while she's dating you. You kind of just continually fucked her over because of your past issues, which sucks because she'll probably have issues now going into future relationships. 

My advice, back off. Don't push her into the relationship. Tell her that you're interested but you're also aware that you've hurt her and destroyed any trust in you she could have, and you only want her to start dating you again if that's what she truly feels is best for her. 

You aren't the one though that got hurt over and over again. You need to right now focus on what's best for her, even if that means screwing you over in the end. You chose the selfish route way too many times and you need to step up to the plate now. I mean honestly my real advice would be to stop talking to her so she could move on and start fresh with someone else, but yeah I'm not sure if you'd listen to that or not.

Remember, if you get back together with her you're not going to be the one who's constantly worried that you're being cheated on, and then feel paranoid for it. You're not the one who's going to think of the ex when being intimate. So yeah, getting back together might be awesome for you, but it might also just *really* prolong destructive feelings for her. 

Also, get yourself into individual therapy. It sounds like you have some stuff to work through from your past relationship, and hopefully you'll learn how to be more successful in future relationships."

The difference in gear is that the engine keeps pushing the slippery tire so it tries to regain traction, but in neutral it would give up easily until the momentum forces it back into traction.

Finally my husband took over and, after the bedtime routine, just started leaving the room earlier and earlier in her drifting-off process. After a month he'd read her a story, say goodnight, turn off the light, and go. For a week we had to enforce the back-in-bed rule, then she was mostly good."

Okay, sure, I understand why this rule might be necessary on a child, but when I say 'child' I'm thinking of, like, ten and younger. Older kids and teens **need** to start learning how to manage their time on their own, because to only learn it once they're living on their own is *disastrous*. At best they'll end up like me and fail out of college the first time they go because they were given no opportunity to develop any time management skills. (To be fair, that was only the secondary reason. The primary reason was depression and anxiety to the point of suicidality, self-harm, and not being able to get out of bed. The 'rents love to ignore that one and blame it all on [disorder] and/or me being a bad kid doomed to failure, though. /eyeroll) At worst, they can't hold a job down and end up homeless because their parents helicoptered them instead of giving them the chance to learn basic life skills.

I faced very similar rules to the one in the post, albeit not enforced by a fake contract. All it did was make me lie about how much homework I had due and not do most of whatever I couldn't get done during school hours. It was so incredibly ineffective and just made me resent them for their controlling behavior. I barely graduated high school because, even though I could get As and Bs on the test, I was getting 0s on a huge chunk of my homework assignments.

Now that I'm out on my own and doing university (this time because *I* want to and because I'm ready for it), all the work gets done, and I have a high GPA. Piece of fucking cake. But I had to teach those skills to myself, because they never wanted to relinquish any control and hand over the reins to my own life until it was almost too late."

I feel like the one thing I want to shout back - ""leave me alone"" - is so unacceptable that I have to keep it to myself, while everyone else can comfortably badger me no end. Of course, there comes the time, when my head clears, that I wish I was messaged by somebody because maybe, just maybe, this time I'll say yes. Unfortunately, communication rapidly becomes overwhelming and I can't sustain it.

anonlymouse,Switzerland,1390637093.0,"Honestly, the friends we made is the only really good thing I can say about it, (and the salads at lunch). I got bullied by a first grader, who was still up to it when I visited Switzerland again a few years later, so nobody at the school had done anything about him, and both my kindergarten teacher and my brother's 4th grade teacher were pretty terrible. Some of the other teachers were certainly better, but with how you get the same teacher throughout all the grades (in the public school system it resets every 3 or 6 years, so that's a bit easier to survive if you get a bad one), if your kid gets a bad one you're going to want to pull them out and put them in the public system. 

Our friends had 4 kids that went to that school, the one that was my age was lucky as she was the teacher's pet, the one a year younger than us ended up getting pulled out as she had troubles too.

You'll meet some very nice and kind people in that community, and yeah, friends for life, but you'll also want to keep a close eye on it and be ready to pull one or both of your kids if they got a bad teacher."

mmp31,politics,1390637146.0,"&gt;The issue with Miltion Friedman's Negative Income Tax is the fact that its a communist policy... And, as you should know, communism doesn't work.

It's not a communist policy.  A communist policy would advocate abolishing government and property entirely, not using government to transfer property from the top down.

&gt;By setting a minimum income for everybody, that completely wipes out work ethic, therefore removing the circulation of income. In a more simplistic way of understanding this, read the Aesop's Fable, ""The Ant and the Grasshopper"". I agree when you say that we should off the welfare system, but with some regulations (I.E. supporting people who are disabled, veterans, etc.). In the case of people who know they can abuse the system, cut them off. They will either wise up, or learn lessons the hard way.

Our welfare system already guarantees a minimum level of income for all, I'm just advocating giving the poor cash instead of vouchers...and the negative income tax eliminates the ""all or nothing"" approach we have now that disincentivizes those who are almost making too much to qualify for welfare to not try to move into higher income groups.  Because if they do, they will lose their benefits and have to start paying income tax.

&gt;  You can be a straight A engineering student, but no one will care if they don't know who you are

In the country I live in, Canada, we have a shortage in the labour market of skilled workers, mostly engineers. It has reached a point where the private sector is demanding the Canadian government ease the immigration process so that we can hire more foreign workers to cover these shortages. 

A simple examination of the job markets in the major Canadian cities will indicate that jobs are plenty in some fields and not in others. I will use Software Engineering and Development for example. In Toronto, there are  approximately 10,000 related job openings for that field. Compare that to Political Science, which boast 60 job openings. Repeat that across the country and you will see the same thing occur. 

It is more than just connections, it is supply and demand as well.

Ask questions if you can't figure something out, and if you feel you're bothering the class with your lack of understanding then send your prof an e-mail or visit their office hours or talk to them after class or something.  And most importantly, GO TO CLASS.  This may all seem really patronizing, but you'd be surprised how many people manage to fail to do all three simultaneously.  It's easier to motivate yourself to be a good student if you learn to care about what you're studying, and that comes with experience, so don't sweat it too much if you find yourself bored to tears with classes in your first few semesters.

And that also women's sexual strategy is basically 'be desirable, and find the best mate to carry offspring' is their strategy?

Ehhhh not really. I think hookups are much more simple than TRP purports. If women aren't obviously interested, I'm not really gonna bother. I'm not a hunter looking for conquests.

TRP flirting tips I think are silly: plate spinning, negging, aloofness, agree and escalate, ""maintaining frame"" (whatever the hell that means), being all macho and dominant, dread game...

I'm very chill when I flirt, kind of silly and friendly too. I've been told by many people that I ""flirt like a girl"" lol.

The thing is, I'm not that macho. Hate sports, but I like art. And ideas. And jokes. Areas you would expect to be fairly unisex. And yet I rarely experience the depth of conversation with women that I've had with close male friends. I've also found that women who purposefully cultivate a more intellectual persona tend to be somewhat bitchy and defensive in conversation.  

Since a girl in high school who I had essentially zero attraction toward, I have not had a close female friend (who I didn't end up hooking up with and shortly thereafter killing the relationship) in ~10 years. Recently, I've actually maintained a totally platonic friendship with a cute girl for the past year. But even there, a part of me doesn't really like her personality all that much and another kind of resents her for not giving me signals that hooking up might be a possibility. Also, I just made out with a work friend last night who I thought I really, truly was only interested in as friends! It's silly, but that's my reality. 

I was raised in a fairly traditional household where my dad was definitely the explicit boss of the family, and my parents are probably the most in-love and content couple I've ever seen, so my primary model of positive relationships involves pretty strict gender roles. On the other hand, I'm much closer with my mom than my dad. So who knows...

Would you mind describing fulfilling, long-lasting platonic friendships that you've experienced or observed? Although I suspect my orientation towards women isn't that different from most men's (whether they admit or not), perhaps I'm missing out on a whole world of human experience.

littlered82,MultipleSclerosis,1390637663.0,"Have you ever tried Acthar? It isn't a steroid, but it works to reduce inflammation like steroids do.

I have had the same mood swings on Solumedrol. I have also had weight gain and it has given me Steroid induced diabetes (I am pre-diabetic but the Solumedrol made my levels go really high).

I have been on Acthar twice. It is a shot you give yourself for a week or 2 (depends on how long the doctor prescribes it for).

With Acthar, you can experience the same side effects as steroids. However, both times I was on it I didn't experience any mood changes. I also did not gain as much weight as I do on Solumedrol because I didn't get as hungry. I didn't have as much problems going to sleep, and I also didn't get that huge spike in my blood sugar. Another good part about it is that you don't have to go to the hospital because you give yourself the shots at home.

Of course everything good thing has a price...a huge one. Here are the cons:

It costs around $50,000 which means you may have trouble getting it approved through insurance. Usually your doctor will fight for you but it may take some time. That means you may have to suffer a couple of weeks through the relapse until you are approved. Also, there is no auto injector. You have to take the needle and jab it in yourself.

It helped me through my relapse. If I ever have a relapse again, I will ask for Acthar because I hate Solumedrol so much.

mmp31,politics,1390637803.0,"&gt;The issue with Miltion Friedman's Negative Income Tax is the fact that its a communist policy... And, as you should know, communism doesn't work.

That's not a communist policy.  A communist policy would advocate abolishing government and property entirely, not using government to transfer property from the top down as the Negative Income Tax would.

&gt;By setting a minimum income for everybody, that completely wipes out work ethic, therefore removing the circulation of income. In a more simplistic way of understanding this, read the Aesop's Fable, ""The Ant and the Grasshopper"". I agree when you say that we should off the welfare system, but with some regulations (I.E. supporting people who are disabled, veterans, etc.). In the case of people who know they can abuse the system, cut them off. They will either wise up, or learn lessons the hard way.

Our welfare system already guarantees a minimum level of income for all and it doesn't kill work ethic at all, because it's barely enough to survive as anyone on welfare will tell you.

Our welfare system does kill incentive for economic advancement though. That's because people who are making almost too much money to qualify for welfare have a strong incentive to not climb the economic ladder any further because they'll lose their benefits.  The NIT completely eliminates that problem.

&gt;You do realize that you described the typical liberal agenda? ""Neo"" or not, conservative republicans (ignoring RINOs like McCain) are completely against large centralized governments?

2. Slavery is not legal in India, so the antebellum US is not comparable to India today. It's more of an issue of law enforcement whereas in the US it was an issue of what the law should be. This is why I used the example of the War on Drugs. Drug trafficking is illegal, yet rampant. We have waged a law enforcement ""war"" against it, which hasn't worked. 

3. The abolition movement in the US was a century in the making before the Civil War. The war was a culmination of many disparate motions to challenge slavery. If we want to apply the same model to India, then we would expect advocacy groups in India to fight many small battles against child slavery and gain momentum as a movement over a long period of time. The example of the US is not one of swift change.

4. Despite being hugely important, the Civil War did not solve the problem of slavery in the US. Decades after slavery was abolished in the US, forced labor continued to be practiced under a different name, most notably through convict laws. The precedent of the US shows how insidious this type of problem can be.

I actually have a great story since my dad just loves to prank my sisters and I. So about 6 years ago my family went through an intense obsession with Nutella. We would always have AT LEAST two jars at home. I never was a fan of it but my sisters and mom were crazy over it. My dad eventually realizes that this cannot possibly be good for us so he tries to snap us out of the Nutella habit by doing something a bit extreme.

So my two sisters and I are all in my room playing some video games. My dad walks in all nonchalantly and strikes some basic conversation with us. 
 
***WARNING FROM HERE ON OUT THE STORY GETS GROSS***  
After a minute or two of random chit chat he suddenly tell us that his butt itches. He then proceeds to reach into his butt and scratch the hell out of it. Once he's done he pulls out his hand with a blob of Nutella. Now see, to us little kids a brown blob coming out of someone's pants is anything BUT Nutella. We instantly assumed the worse and ran for our lives. You think it'd be over right? WRONG. My dad then decides to chase us around the house with the blob of Nutella all while we are screaming bloody murder. Finally after about 5 minutes of chasing us he stops. Just flat out stops in his tracks. He then proceeded to lick the blob of Nutella from his hands. By this point me and my sisters are absolutely mortified. My youngest sister nearly threw up. Once everything calmed down a bit my dad decides to do the big reveal. Once he disclosed to us that it was just Nutella the whole time you could feel the relief seeping from my sisters and I. After that day, none of us really like Nutella anymore. At least his plan worked! Thanks for hosting!"

suggesting ""education"" as a preventative measure is absurd, since in part the push for more education (higher education in particular) is one of the causes of this development.

the majority of the jobs you can get out of higher education are useless, and to be frank there just *aren't enough jobs* to sustain the population any more. it doesn't matter how many kids go to college, most of them aren't going to walk away with a job that was worth their time, effort and the money they paid for their education.

most of what people learn in high school is useless- the only thing kids are really getting out of it is a place to socialize and a piece of paper. 

the majority of information you learned (especially in science, math, and socials/history/geography) is extremely context-sensitive stuff that is only going to be useful to people with certain career choices. (who will most of the time end up re-learning all of this shit anyways.) with science and math they will even teach you *wrong fucking information* and let it sit there for a few years before explaining ""It actually is a lot more complex than that, we kind of lied before sorry"".. meanwhile, they took their sweet time trying to get you to remember the names of 3 insignificant fucks who did a total of 1 minor thing during the French Revolution.

Saffs15,todayilearned,1390638598.0,"I served, and I disagree on both points. It was at no point drilled into me that I shouldn't ever question orders. Hell, my superiors brought up that sometimes it's needed decently often. Going through basic training didn't make my thought process of right or wrong go away. I still thought about it every time I was told to do something, especially outside the wire. I was never ordered do anything illegal, but if I had felt like it was, I damn sure would had stood up against it. The reason you don't hear about soldiers not following them is because that it just isn't needed often, and that's not the type of stuff that makes it into the headlines.

And saying someone can't get out of a contract is the loss of free will just isn't accurate. No matter the case of being in the military or not, breaking a contract will very often have consequences. Granted, the militaries can be very harsh, but it's not like it's the only job that doesn't have consequences for getting out of it. And going AWOL doesn't usually entail jail time. (Also, there's only been one person executed for desertion since the civil war, and that was in 45. It just doesn't happen anymore, and hasn't in so long that it's barely relevant.)

And the getting called back in thing doesn't exactly happen either. When you sign your first contract, you sign up for 8 years. No matter what, it's always 8 years. You may chose to only serve 3 of those Active, but for the next 5 you have signed that contract saying they can bring you back in if need be (being on IRR).

We ended up having a case opened and CPS visited the house. We live in a brand new house and CPS wanted to see the barns.

If just, why kill the innocent?  If loving, why punish for eternity, rendering reformation irrelevant?  If omnipotent, why use death as a tool when other means are available?

I feel especially bad for my friend who graduated with a History major last year and still hasn't found a job in his field. Same with my poli sci major friend who had to settle for work as a janitor because he couldn't find a job in...our nation's capital of all places. 

Going to school for something you are passionate about is nice and all, hell I did it for Political Science for 2 years, however I think that going into a field where the job market is inflated, where supply does not meet demand is extremely ill-thought out and generally a bad idea. 

Take teachers in my home province of Ontario for instance. The supply far exceeds the demand. So much so that it is not uncommon for a substitute teacher to be substitute teaching for 10 years before he secures a full-time job in the field. A lot of these teachers have accumulated tons of student debt and have to work another full-time job as they await their part-time substitute one to open up and be the dream they wanted to live. Simple research would have shown them that becoming a teacher in Ontario is really stupid fucking idea. 

I guess I come from the opinion that one ought to focus their education around the job market. Once you are older, you can always go back to school and learn one of your passions so that it doesn't bite you in the ass.

Not wanting to bleed it myself I paid brake masters to do it for me.The technician who had done it wondered why the pedal travel was still so far. He dug around and noticed my pads had bad wear. He told me how to correctly install the next set and put the wheels back on. With an impact wrench, I thought nothing of it at the time. Foolish of me to think nothing was wrong, yes.When I got off work today I got new pads(needed them anyways)and began my work. When I got to this wheel I break the nuts loose with my breaker bar as normal, except it was a little harder than the rest, no problem a little more muscle should do it right? Snap, it broke off. There was no way i turned it the wrong way. ive done all the bolt ons to this car minus sway/stabilizer bars and a tune; never once has that happened.His impact wrench probably put it on too tight and weakened the metal.

&gt;Hi Captains,

&gt;I wanted to stop by and let you know we've been reading (and will continue to) this thread since it's inception and are considering your feedback -- it's not being fallen deaf ears and we appreciate the passion everyone has around the event and the new ships. Please just remember to keep your feedback constructive, as nonconstructive feedback is harder to consider.

&gt;I may have some additional information than this, but here is some more information about the event that I can share now:


&gt;As mentioned, you'll get 400 Qmendations on your first play through of the new FE.

&gt;The ""daily"" to get 40 more has taken 2-5 minutes on average during testing, and you either complete one mini-game or another for the daily.

&gt;The event runs for 28 days (we say 25+ as we also have maintenances, etc.)

&gt;With only 600 more Qmendations needed, you'll need to complete 15 dailies in those 28 days (around once every other day, or so).


&gt;We've got this information and much more planned in upcoming Dev Blogs, so stay tuned and thanks again for your passion and feedback.

&gt;Cheers,

laxt,IAmA,1390640165.0,"You actually caught me there, I was making a ballpark figure.  I also request that, for what it's worth, you to believe that IQ tests I've taken have given me a score over 130 every time; so I'm not Einstein-genius intelligent but solidly at-or-above astronaut (Ex. I actually read somewhere, unlike anything published for Bush, that John Glenn's IQ is around 132-136).

Do I really need to explain why I think George W. Bush's IQ is lower than average?  I think we both know why.

Now, I wasn't the first monkey in space either, nor will I ever be, but I'm pretty sure my math and logic abilities will rank superior to [Albert II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkeys_and_apes_in_space#United_States).  What I will say is that if we listed those who got to the Presidency in the US primarily on his wits, George W. Bush would more certainly not be on it.  His name/resemblance got him there, his father's connections got him there (ie. SCOTUS decision), his much more politically adept brother helped get him there (no conspiracy theories, just strictly referring to Jeb being Governor of a major swing state during a campaign season), one of the most crooked campaign managers in US history got him there, Dick Cheney got him there, and his opponent's incompetent campaigning and campaign staff got Bush there too.  Not to mention 6-8 years of Rush Limbaugh's rise in popularity by manipulation with the facts; not in the least the biggest manipulation of all: that he is not news but rather entertainment -- his listener base, much like Daily Show, ignorantly rely on his musings as news.  But George W. Bush makes Lyndon Johnson look like Oscar Wilde.  Not really, just a comical image, but you get my point.

There's a point on the spectrum of intellect where we no longer bask in a sense of superiority (EDIT: one would be foolish to do so, as it doesn't act like a damned superpower and you can still be fooled -- not to mention the idea that one probably shouldn't know their IQ number), but rather just sorta take it for granted.  For instance, a championship baseball player gets over his skill after a while, ya know?  Nevertheless, he can still spot the excellent players from the good, and the good from the bad, and the bad from the terrible.  Like I said, I'm not super-genius but I can certainly spot the good from the bad pretty easily.  And for all I know, you can too, so I hope you know what I mean.

Finally, I forgive you for assuming that I was citing some junk figure out of some politically skewed article, as I've seen the same myself.  Rest assured, I had no use for that when guessing the horsepower inside Dubya's noggin.  Really it's the political climate we're in (which of course is nothing next to, ya know, Iran, North Korea, Palestine and most recently Ukraine, but still, I understand it's the most polarized since the Civil War, but still take this with a grain of salt) that is guilty of your assuming this, so I don't blame you."

funkymunniez,gaming,1390640422.0,"Like I told someone else who doesn't grasp the concept of sea monsters in relation to pirates, in the era black flag takes place, it was not uncommon for sailors to simply believe in sea monsters and other mythical beings (Davey Jones).  This keeps a ""sea monster"" plausible in terms of the historical recreation.  On top of that, things like the kraken were very likely misunderstandings based on sightings of actual creatures.  With the amount of boats that roamed the ocean in the era, the likelihood of one of them seeing a giant squid or other large monster was pretty high.  Not knowing what it was and sharing the story (likely drunk) from person to person at a bar leads to the kraken.  So that leaves the door very much wide open for some kind of sea monster encounter, whether it turn out to be a real creature or a giant monster.

Now, let's remember that this is a *video game* and not a historical documentry.  A video game that up until recently was about fucking *space wizards that controlled humans with little baseballs*.  A kraken fight isthe line to far in a game about pirates?"

Gertiel,AskReddit,1390641004.0,"My ex boss met a woman on a website called something like sugarbabies. This woman was in her twenties while he was in his mid fifties. But don't worry, folks, neither of them were really into the sugar daddy thing. They both just made profiles for fun. 

The woman was purportedly living in her parents' home in North Carolina going to school to be a nurse while her parents raised her daughter in Florida so she could concentrate on school. I suppose there was some truth in that as the ex boss flew with her to Florida and met the parents and the child. He also flew to see her and flew her to his home a number of times. Eventually he flew both her and her kid to our backward rural Texas small town and took them house shopping. 

A couple of weeks later when he'd bought her yet another plane ticket to visit him she never showed up. At that point, he hired an online PI to investigate her. He found a number of profiles across the internet using her picture. Several purported differing names, and on two of them she'd posted about pending marriages to two other guys. 

She called him up the next day and claimed she missed the plane due to her car breaking down. She wanted him to loan her several thousand dollars to repair it. He declined."

Tried to turn a few mutual friends against me.  It didn't work.

Most pathetic?  

Full on in tears and sobbing hysterically, begged me to get back together with her when I left because she cheated.

Most immature?  

I had one who had a habit of throwing half full cups from her work on my lawn.  Every day she worked, if she got off shift at night, a cup would be there.  Like clockwork.

I tried calling her, but she wouldn't pick up.  I left a polite message asking her to stop, but they kept coming.

Eventually I started collecting them.  When I had enough of them I filled a trash bag.  I added three bottles of syrup to the bag, shook it vigorously, kicked it around for a bit, and emptied it on her lawn and porch when I knew she would be at work.

Looking back on it, it's kind of funny.  When we would eat pancakes, she was fond of saying ""You can never have too much syrup.""  I wonder if she still feels the same?

pepernoten,AskWomen,1390641047.0,"I don't know that my original answer wasn't necessarily a technique. If we consider foreplay a part of sex, and an extremely important one at that, why isn't 'afterplay' also considered part of sex? I think it is just as important and something that is often overlooked. The same way you need to gauge a woman's reaction to things you do beforehand, figure out her erogenous zones, etc, you need to gauge a woman's reaction afterward. Maybe she's not into cuddling, maybe she's not into talking. Perhaps all she needs is for you to put your hand on her waist to feel connected. It's not all purely an emotional response. After an orgasm, my nerves all over my body are hyper sensitive and having my SO stroke my skin feels just incredible. I like the emotional connection with someone not because I need to feel validated and pretty but because sex with emotion is more enjoyable to me than sex without emotion.

PixelLight,funny,1390641393.0,"Wrong because that's not a nice guy. Not to mention human relationships are a lot more complex than that. 

Personal example: I've had a girl express sexual interest in me before(this was a girl who wanted to fuck me when I had time, even to the point of picking out a date when I had time) and then for reasons I'm unclear on that stopped and she just wanted to be friends. I enjoyed the friendship part but I'm of the disposition to not be able to change my feelings after a sudden development like that. By which I mean to be able to think of her only platonically rather than in a sexual sense too. To many people it would almost appear like I was expecting sex and in a sense I was but not in return for being a nice guy, not because I felt I was obligated it, but because I thought they wanted to because I thought they found me attractive. Now a girl might want to sleep with a guy because he's nice but not for being nice but the motivations behind the actions, I guess. And there's nothing wrong with finding pleasant people attractive. Strangely enough I find unpleasant people unattractive. It's a real turnoff."

Coming from the other side, it's hard only having one close, local friend, especially when you don't have anything else to do. NEET lifestyle leads to this a lot, you feel a desperate need to distract yourself from your lack of movement, and friends/drugs/vidyagames/alcohol/etc can become compulsions that are hard to ignore. I've been a bad friend to people by ignoring their need for space, need for someone that can talk about something other than ""I don't do shit but smoke weed,"" etc.

You might lose your friendship with this guy, but you need to be able to live YOUR life, and if he can't handle that, he needs to learn to handle it; he needs to live HIS life as well, and he's probably using your company as a way to fill a void he needs to address in other, more constructive ways."

This was like 92-96 my brother went there and I think they were a year ahead.  His best friend lived in their house on William St!

Such a moment for me right now, seeing you guys dig them.  I had their first album on cassette; it was a red/chrome cassette.  They got their name from a line at the end of [Groundhog's Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=xkW_ZkMtmlQ#t=233).  Listen for Ned rattling off the insurance policies.

EDIT: Aww great, I'm not special since the bot gave away the trivia on how they decided their name.  Research closer and you'll be able to verify me on their coming together at MWC.

EDIT2: Upon gazing their [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismemberment_Plan) I think I actually got their first EP rather than their album.  Because I clearly remember ""Can We Be Mature"".  I was in high school and felt so cool having this tape of a college band my brother, who I hung out with on weekends at MWC quite a bit.

green_lightning,melbourne,1390641461.0,"In Optus' sort-of defence (I worked at a major ISP for over 5 years, mostly as senior tech support), systems that govern plan changes are very complex. It sounds as if there is a network or system fault which is preventing plan changes taking affect. This - in my experience - happens once every few months. They can take some time to resolve because usually there are several systems trying to talk to each other and one has gone very out of whack. Now unfortunately, because its a long weekend, resolution is probably not going to happen until early next week, at a guess. YMMV.

Your best bet is to ring again and ask to speak to a manager or senior. Find out if there is a fault. If there is, you'll just have to wait it out. Perhapas ask if they can contact you again once the fault is resolved and you might be able to swing a small credit out of them."

ialsohaveadobro,relationships,1390641586.0,"A free edit for you.  This version softens the blow a bit more, emphasizes ending the harassment, and is more careful about tone:

Hello John,

My name is ____.  I am truly sorry to have to be the one to let you know this, but I unknowingly had an affair with your wife Sally from (Month) 2011 to (Month) 2012. Please hear me out, as I am not sending this out of spite or malice. I was completely unaware of her marital status at the time. When I found out, I ended it with her immediately. 
  
Obviously, some time has passed since then, so you may be wondering why I am just now letting you know.  I am not sending this to hurt you but to give you a chance to make your own choice.  At first I thought it best to let Sally tell you what happened, herself, but I don't believe she has done so.  Instead of moving on from what happened, she has been bombarding me with constant messages, phone calls, and emails -- not only to me but even to my girlfriend. The harassment has been going on for quite some time now and she has not listened to our warnings or taken a hint.  It really has reached the point that my girlfriend and I feel that we are being stalked by Sally.

You deserve to know the truth about Sally, so you can decide what you think is best to do.  My girlfriend and I want to move on with our lives.  We need Sally's harassment to stop.  

I understand that this may be a shock or a lot to take in.  I understand that you don't know me and may not be prepared to believe me just based on this message.  If you would like to speak or meet I can show your proof of the affair and her harassment. You can contact me at XXXXX(google voice number).  

Please understand that I would never have become involved with Sally had I known she was married.  I'm sorry to have to communicate such bad news by a Facebook message, too, but I don't have another way to contact you.

I'm very sorry.  I hope things turn out for the best for you.

Added:  Another thing I thought of.  Back in the 90s I would often do HIV education sessions in schools.  Where possible I would take someone with HIV to share their story.  I used a new woman once when my usual trusted speakers were not available.  I had known her awhile, she had been an IDU and street working prostitute for years, and her husband had died of HIV, basically very clear high risk behaviours, no surprises there.  She is speaking to the kids and proceeds to tell them about her past life, then says she acquired HIV when her husband was dying because he grabbed her arm and bit her.

You might want to get your definitions of capitalism straight, because the heyday of imperialism was capitalist from the very beginning.

&gt;Nowadays it's pretty much always cheaper to buy what you want from another nation rather than taking it by threat of force.

You use the force to gain market access. Not much difference from the days of gunboat policy.

&gt;It's a nice positive feedback loop that makes both countries richer.

Not really, it mostly makes the owning classes in both countries richer, while driving everyone else towards the subsistence wage in the long run.

SublethalDose,socialskills,1390642310.0,"&gt; I've tried different approaches, but generally I try to carry on just as before the date, occasional texting(I'm not a big texter), talking about hobbies, making jokes and the like. This is the point where my anxiety begins to dominate my behavior and I lose confidence.  I know several dates have been canceled because I became very awkward....

I'm not sure I understand the timing.  You make a date with them, and then you spend a lot of time with them socially before the date?  It's not a situation I've dealt with before, so I'm curious.  Usually if I ask a girl out, I don't see her again until the date, so a date is really a done deal.  That's why I thought you must be doing something really out of the ordinary to spook these women. 

If you make a date with a woman, and then you spend more time with them socially, become anxious, and start acting differently than you did at first, and then they cancel the date, it isn't as strange as I was thinking.  They were interested in dating the person you were at first, but not the person you turned into later.  You need to close the gap between those two people, the suave guy who gets dates and the guy who is so anxious he can't talk.  

It may surprise you, but I don't think the anxious awkwardness is the first problem to worry about.  I wonder if you were really yourself when you made the initial good impression.   Of course you aren't really yourself when you're dumbstruck with anxiety, either, but the more of an act I put on, the more severe the anxiety I have about keeping it up, and the greater the contrast between the smooth act I can pull off for a couple of hours and what I can keep up long term.  If you spend a lot of time with someone, you can't fool them in the long run about who you are, so deception is a recipe for mounting anxiety as you worry more and more about your cover slipping.

Of course, when you lack confidence and self-worth, honesty in dating isn't a simple issue.  "

Edit:  I've been involved, somewhat, in the modding scene for Morrowind, very deeply involved in the modding scene for WoW, and now a very interested observer in the modding scene for Minecraft.  And it's very interesting how the same issues crop up over, and over, and over.  A big chunk of modders (usually lone wolf coders who often do incredibly creative things before imploding under the weight of their own mod) fall into the ""it's mine, I wrote it, I should have 100% control over it"" camp; another big chunk fall into a broad copyleft/open source/team effort camp.  And while I have sympathy for the former, I have to note that the latter tend to produce much more lasting contributions...and a lot less drama.

I ran across a wonderful essay discussing this divide (between those who see mods as, basically, works of art you can take or leave; nobody walks into an art gallery and modifies a painting, and those who see mods as collaborative toys for the community to use and move forward), but I can't find it now.  I *think* it was about Giskard (the archetypal example, from the TES/Oblivion community, of the solitary mad creator who'd rather set his work on fire than see it altered one iota; even a hint that another modmaker might have used one of his mods for inspiration was anathema to him).  But as I said, I can't find it now.

Anyhow, I feel like some support from Mojang will be good for the modding community.  We don't benefit from pathetic things like Sengir's use of bees to destroy the world of ""unapproved"" modpacks, or Greg and mDiyo's little dustup."

You see, I am also a college student who had a similar problem, my parents tried to make me understand but I didn't.
I used to prefer video games more than studies. So I also looked up on Reddit, that why is it that we dont get addicted to studies, the main reason I got is the reward factor. Studying or doing hard work is rewarding but not immediate, while other things like gaming and stuff, fills you up with a rewardomine which gets you hooked. 
This phrase -*Rewards can come all ways, to chose the long term one is the right decision* has helped me a lot. I have reduced gaming from then.

green_lightning,melbourne,1390644132.0,"Ok, I used to work for a major ISP for a very long time and am well versed in dealing with exactly the kind of complaint you're making. Here's the thing, all Australian ISP's are bound by very, very strict privacy laws and staff have it drilled into them to only speak to the account holder via ID process. Yes, you can nominate someone to act on behalf of the account holder and frequently this is noted, but sometimes it is missed (the reality is the majority of staff on the phones are teenagers or early 20s, with varying levels of computer literacy and social skills, most haven't been on the job for more than a few months, they're likely still getting their heads around some of the very complex (and badly designed) software they're staring at AND they have to deal with an angry customer on the other end of the line that is frequently computer illiterate. It is an *exceptionally* stressful job.).

Whilst I'm sorry to hear of your beleaguered state of affairs, here's what you can do about it:
Ring iiNet support *in the morning*. Your chances of getting an Australian-based rep are much higher. Ask to speak to a senior/floorwalker. Explain the situ to them. They are highly experienced senior tech support staff and know almost all there is to know about the job, well the good ones at least. If you have already made an official complaint with the TIO, then process follows that they'll refer the case back to iiNet, and a specific rep will contact you with 10 working days.

Getting angry on social media doesnt really help, although iiNet reps do monitor whirlpool, twitter and iiNet's facebook page. But really, escalate the issue within iiNet's own support channels (by speaking with a senior) first before going to the TIO.

Good luck."

Are you sure? You sound as dumb as a 14 year old. Arguing against equal opportunity is pretty fucking stupid.

&gt;Truth is, you're just trying to rationalize why you didn't go to college, or if you did go to college, why you didn't get a nice job.

lovely. Instead of making a real argument you just throw fallacies around, great job.

&gt;The point of high school is to go to college

no shit. that's the only point, high school teachers don't give a shit because 90% of their curriculum is going to be re-taught if it's at all relevant to the student's future. it's daycare for teenagers.

&gt;But if you get a shitty major (in your case, if you even went to college, it was something like philosophy lol) then you are gonna get a shitty job.

another personal attack.

&gt;Do you honestly think people who major in civil engineering or biochemistry are really unable to find jobs? Cause they're not, there's tons of demand for them. Yes there is less job demand in some areas, but only those that don't require education or skills, production or construction. And yes there are a lot of people who go to college and don't get anything out of it, but it's because they don't get useful majors that are in high demand. Oh you majored in philosophy? That's nice, have fun making people coffee. 

This is such a shit argument. If everyone majors in civil engineering or biochemistry then there will no longer be ""tons"" of demand for them. Furthermore not everyone wants to be a STEMlord, the vast majority of people find it boring because it is for the most part slow, tedious work.

It doesn't matter anyways, because we have more people than we have jobs. Your shitty methods only further fuel the problem, the only proper solution is /r/basicincome which is an extremely optimistic and far-off plan.

Your post is terrible by the way, in it you address none of what I said while basically screaming ""NO IT'S FINE IF YOU MAJOR IN ___ AND ___ LOL YOU LIBERAL ARTS MAJOR LMAO NO WONDER YOU CAN'T FIND A JOB, LOL""

Nevermind the fact that I explicitly said in my post that most of the money these days is in trades. So I have no idea why the hell you assumed I'm a ""philosophy major"". You still have to go to trades school too, so it's not a justification for not going to college. (I don't work in trades, but just in general what I do is not at all relevant to my point.)

Since you threw personal attacks at me, I'm going to drum up some of my own. Either you're a 20 year old introverted STEM major (who doesn't drink, have sex or do drugs. Probably doesn't shower either.) who thinks he's going to rake in a bunch of cash after he gets his degree, or you're 35-40 years old and completely out of touch with how education and the job market is for young people today."

Every speck of matter on Earth arrived from elsewhere.  It did so in the form of meteor impacts.  Which means that every square inch of ground you can see arrived from space, and most were struck by other arrivals.

The fact that so few meteor scars remains is precisely because they were weathered beyond all recognition.

[One of the biggest and oldest known impacts has been found in Greenland](http://news.yahoo.com/discovery-earths-oldest-crater-largest-too-192932095.html):  500 km wide on formation, 3 billion years old (1.5 billion years younger than the Earth itself).

It's kind of standard practice in the Russian arms industry, with similar variations in exported APC's and tanks as well.

Is it fair to the Indians in this case?  Hardly.  I'm guessing Russia realizes that the Indians are in a tight spot in terms of who else is interested in/willing to sell to them, and intends to shake them down for as much cash as they can put out.  (Same deal with the INS Vikramaditya refit--the Russians quoted the job to them as $800m, then quickly pushed it well over $2b as soon as they were on the hook.)

A mild soap is important, so you can wash yourself and your client without messing up your skin too much. The girl in Spain was very thorough about washing certain areas of my body, and I understood why when she started using her mouth on those areas with much enthusiasm.

I think a couch is nice as well. It's a good place to have a drink and start the foreplay.

One thing I haven't seen much of but I think does a lot for my enjoyment is a thin condom that fits me well. I'm pretty average so condom size is usually not a problem, but a thinner condom feels much better.

Malgayne,Games,1390646264.0,"I'm not sure of any reason why that's obvious? Create Candy Crush, releases version for Facebook with levels and call it Candy Crush Saga, work ons new Saga title, then CCS takes off and suddenly you're a zillionaire. Expand your team, hire a lawyer , get told that if you're going to call all your games ""Saga"" then you should really own the trademark, etc.

Besides, if it turned out you COULD own the trademark on a common word, you'd be stupid not to do it.

EDIT: Hey, guess what? The system worked exactly as intended. The following was written on my Facebook by my best friend, a contractual lawyer:

Companies can't just buy up words and control them. If King could just buy ""____ ____ Saga"" and prevent other people from using it, I'm sure they would, but they aren't allowed to do that.  They aren't even allowed to buy the words ""Candy Crush Saga"" in that exact order, despite the fact that they actually HAVE a game called Candy Crush Saga.

Instead, all they are allowed to do is say, ""If somebody sees a (i) videogame that has the name form (ii) ""____ ____ Saga,"" they will (iii) not be sure whether or not it's one of our games.""  And that is all they have said.

As rules go, I think this is a perfectly sensible one.  Individuals and companies work hard at making their brands real in people's minds, and other people should not be allowed to piggy-back off that brand consciousness.  Nike doesn't own the WORDS, ""Just Do It,"" but that doesn't mean I should be allowed to market my athletic sneakers using those words.  That would be true even if I personally had never heard of Nike or their slogan, if I were marketing my shoes in a market that had.

If my (i) (ii) (iii) statement were true, then I think everybody would agree that Stoic would have to choose a different name.  The outrage, I think, boils down to two categories.  There are people who simply think, for whatever reason, that trademark (!= copyright) law is bad, and presumably would agree that I *can* market my athletic sneakers with the slogan, ""Just Do It.""  Then there are people who are okay with the rule, and simply disagree that ""____ ____ Saga"" is associated with King's games in the real world.  These people would say, ""Obviously Stoic shouldn't be able to use a name that would cause reasonable people to wonder if it's one of King's games - but they aren't DOING that.""

I think that's a perfectly reasonable answer.  On the other hand, to those people, I think we can say two things:

1. Nobody has prevented Stoic from using the name, ""The Banner Saga.""  King objected to their use.  The Patent and Trademark Office said, ""Objection noted.  We're marking that name down as referring to Stoic"" (see http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4802:m3262q.2.1).  There is currently an actual videogame, made by Stoic, using the exact name, ""The Banner Saga.""

2. *King accepted this outcome* (see http://www.joystiq.com/2014/01/22/the-banner-saga-still-coming-to-tablets-candy-crush-saga-dev-wo/).  If they actually had it in for Stoic, they could have sued and let a court (or a jury) determine whether, in fact, reasonable people would look at The Banner Saga and say, ""I don't know ... was that made by the Candy Crush Saga and Farm Heroes Saga guys?""  They didn't do that.

So why would King object in the first place?  Is this a case of them trying to bully a plucky start-up studio and then withdrawing after the righteous wrath of the internet was focused upon their villainy?  I don't think so.  There is a perfectly mundane explanation for King to object, lose, and then say, ""Okay.""

Remember that the entire point of trademark law is that you CAN'T own words, but you CAN own your brand identity.  Since this is the underlying justification, it is the rule (and a sensible one, I think) that if a company repeatedly decides not even to say, ""Um, your product's name might make people think it's one of our products,"" they are inferred not to CARE whether other people's products might make people think it's one of their products.  This is really perfectly sensible.  You can't just say nothing as Companies A, B, and C piggy-back off of your brand identity and then sue the crap out of Company D when it does the exact same thing.  That simply isn't fair.

Now, of course, King probably doesn't actually CARE about suing Company A (Stoic).  What they DO care about is being able to sue Company D when they come along with a game called Candy Heroes Saga.  And when that day comes, they don't want Company D to be able to say, ""But Your Honor, they let The Banner Saga go without raising a single objection!""

Or they could be villains wilting in the light of the righteous rage of the internet.  But I don't believe in ascribing to villainy (especially conveniently weak-willed villainy) what can be ascribed to rational self-interest."

But I can just forget about it forever if it came down to it.

This is exactly why I love to do PI. I can set up my income with 1-2h per day on effort and once per three days I haul. That gives me decent income without needing to worry much. I usually did it extremely lazy, only mining P0 materials (15m/day for 1 toon 5 planets) and that was easy cash. Especially when you run 6-10 toons on PI. However, I do agree that we need to get more options for Planetary Interaction, and I really dig the expedited control. Another option would be to give control corp-wide and put all your PI alts in one toon."

I grew up thinking my grandpa went to Europe when the war was over and never saw any action, cause he only told lighthearted stories about what he did there. Then all of a sudden when I was about 20, he tells me a story about getting ambushed by mortar rounds and crawling past his platoon mates' bodies, thinking that was it for him. He got this really serious look and tone I'd never seen in him before or since - he even remembered the names of the men he saw at the time. 

He's never spoken about it since. Even my mom (his daughter) has only recently been getting a few scattered details from it. Point is: we all want to know more but don't want to make him revisit his time in the war when it's obviously painful for him. "

tPRoC,TrueReddit,1390646296.0,"&gt; Oh my god you took philosophy

way to read my post. I did not take philosophy nor do I plan to.

&gt; and know logical fallacies.

most people should be familiar with *at least a couple* logical fallacies.

&gt;Your only ""argument"" is that there won't be demand for civil engineering or biochemistry if everyone majors in them (which of course is slippery slope you fucking retard, but you know that)

That's not slippery slope at all, you obtuse fuck. That is literally just basic fucking math (for someone who seems to be an engineer you're pretty fucking shit at it apparently, might want to get on that) if there are more people than jobs in a field, then there *is no fucking demand.* It would be slippery slope if I said that ""If 1000 students go for civil engineering then before you know it 1 million students will go for civil engineering!!!!""

&gt;Truth is, there are tons of great majors that provide +100 incomes. Every type of engineering, every type of chemistry, computer science, mathematics, geology, bushiness, etc.

not everyone wants to be in a STEM field. The majority of STEM students drop out. STEM fields have a fucking 60% drop-out rate, and it's because those fields are boring, tedious, and difficult for most people.

Even if we assume that most people did want to be STEM majors, all it would do is overcrowd that job market as more people flooded in (which I said before.)

&gt;China and India vastly outnumber us in amount of engineers, and as the world becomes a more global economy, the US simply won't be able to compete without having tons of engineers. You probably don't even realize how important engineers are and will continue to be. 

China and India vastly outnumber us full stop. Yes engineers are important. Nowhere in any of my posts did I say they weren't important. You seem to be using these posts as a platform for you to re-assure yourself that as an engineer, you are important. Don't worry. You seem autistic. I am sure you'll be fine at engineering.

&gt;You really think plumbers and electricians are gonna let the US stay a world power? 

Who gives a shit if the US stays a world power? I don't even live in the US. Again, none of this is relevant to the point I was making (which is that highschool is for the most part a useless stepping stone, not everyone wants to be a STEM major, and that trades are undervalue by most)

Also, do you not realize that plumbers and electricians are pretty fucking important?

Gertiel,solotravel,1390646957.0,"$27 USD currently = about 19.74 euro  and $47 USD = 34.36 euro per a quick google. Hostel.com lists the cheapest youth hostel in Rome as offering a dorm room for US$12.93 in advance.

This is not to put you off your idea, but rather to arm you with some facts to help you make it happen. Rome is going to be among the more expensive places, so you'd want to try to couchsurf there. You could pick some other places in Italy with cheaper youth hostels as well. You can substitute any of your more expensive popular tourist cities for Rome, such as Paris, London, etc.

The rail pass might be a good idea depending on your plans. If you can plan where you intend going by early April, you may find buying single tickets in advance online cheaper than a rail pass. If you'd rather not plan and travel city-to-city at the drop of a hat, definitely rail pass. I only mention the advance planning option because $1500 is a fair chunk to drop prior to your trip.

You don't mention your age, but if you're young enough a valid student ID can be a valuable travel companion.

Buses aren't necessarily cheaper than a rail pass, but certainly can be. Megabus and Eurail Lines both have some cheap deals. I think I saw $15 Eurail Lines bus fare London to Paris when researching my upcoming journey. If you are the sort that can sleep anywhere, traveling by night bus can be an excellent savings.

It is going to be important to watch your food spending. Doesn't mean you have to live on ramen, though. Look up information on local markets or ask your couchsurfing hosts. You can usually find all sorts of bargains at local markets, especially if you are adventurous. I like to try things I've never tried before myself and can't wait to sample jellied eel and kidney pie in England. Last visit one of my best meals was a pork and potato pastie from a small kiosk a short walk from the London Dungeon.

yeya93,politics,1390647458.0,"You're the one writing stupid posts here. Why would a person without a bank account use an ATM at a liquor store? That's a completely different scenario. We're not talking about cashing checks, we're talking about withdrawing money from a bank account that you already have.

I guess I'm thinking locally too. When you go to a grocery store and you swipe your debit card, the system gives you a cash back option. The cashier gives you whatever amount you choose in cash and it's withdrawn from your account.

I'd say most people are planning ahead, and people who withdraw money in places that charge high fees need money immediately and it just so happened that the nearest ATM was in a liquor store. And they did what anyone, rich or poor, would have done. Because if you use this place to withdraw your money from regularly, that can add up quite a lot. I find it highly unlikely that people, especially people with limited funds, do this.

""Just saying"" is a way for me to explain my viewpoint. I could have said ""This is what I would probably do if I were poor,"" but adding the ""just saying"" explains that ""saying"" is all I'm doing. I'm not judging people who withdraw money from casinos. I'm not advocating for a law banning people from withdrawing money from casinos. I'm also not demanding that poor people spend their money the way I would. Adding a ""just saying"" is supposed to imply that."

&gt; Os abusos à integridade física das pessoas são uma forma tão verdadeira de praxe como qualquer outra, já que casos de mortes, violência, etc. são bastante comuns e sobretudo repetem-se anos após ano. Se fossem aberrações de praxe os praxistas não repetiam. Mas há sempre aqueles que continuam essa ""tradição académica"" e com gosto. 

Isto é falso. A praxe verdadeira não tem violência, não tem abusos. O que estas pessoas fazem não é praxe. É uma versão pervertida.

É a mesma coisa que proibir a utilização de todos os automóveis porque ocorrem acidentes e corridas ilegais. Ou a abolição da democracia por abusos de poder e corrupção. O Problema são os abusos, não o acto em si."

[Sura 9 verse 41](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.041): Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah! That is best for you if ye but knew.

[Sura 9 verse 29 ](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.029): Fight those who do not believe in Allah, nor in the latter day, nor do they prohibit what Allah and His Messenger have prohibited, nor follow the religion of truth, out of those who have been given the Book, until they pay the tax in acknowledgment of superiority and they are in a state of subjection.

pakap,printSF,1390648901.0,"Well the thing is...the field of AI is about 50 years old. So predicting where it will be in 50 years is a tad hard. Some researchers think that most of the ""low-hanging fruit"" has already been picked, and that we're left with the very hard stuff.

I'm not a researcher, but I did write a Master's paper on AI, and for my money, the big breakthrough will come *after* we find a non-invasive brain-imaging method with better resolution than what we currently have. The best we can do right now in terms of studying a live, working brain is fMRI, which has a resolution around the cubic millimeter IIRC. That's just not good enough to start understanding how our brain works, let alone imitate it to build our own conscious machines/upload our brains to the Cloud.

So I'd be wary of making predictions. Historically, whenever AI researchers have made these they've been utterly, completely wrong - the first Dartmouth Conference, where AI was invented, was supposed among other things to find a way to process and output natural languages (like English) - basically pass the Turing Test. We still aren't there yet.

And of course there's the funniest thing in the AI business : the Moravec Paradox. Basically, the simpler an action is for *us* humans, the harder it is to make a robot/AI do it correctly. Playing chess is a piece of cake for AIs now, but we still can't make a robot that can run (on two legs) without falling on its face."

ellski,SkincareAddiction,1390649133.0,"Oh dear! First thing would stop with the masks &amp; scrubs. Clinique cleanser is okay, so you can probably keep using that for the mean time. Get a decent moisturizer like the cerave ones or cetaphil. They're both pretty gentle and reasonably cheap - there's information in the sidebar. Try using that for a week, and see how your skin goes. My next thing to change would be adding in a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide spot treatment to use on your pimples. 

Since you've been so abrasive to your skin, I'd avoid adding exfoliating for a while. Using a damp wash cloth is probably the most your skin can handle at the moment. Later you'll want to add a chemical exfoliator probably, there's more information in the side bar about that.

Change your cleanser probably only when you run out of the clinique. It's okay, but it's expensive. There are recommendations in the beginner's guide.

You should also be using sunscreen, I really like Neutrogena, but again there are sidebar recommendations.

greiger,WritingPrompts,1390649581.0,"“Give me all of your money,” this damn kid again. Every day he “hid” in the alley on High Street, between 19th and 18th and harassed a random person who walked by, today it was me. His knife moved back and forth while pointing at my chest as people streamed past in an uncaring haze that was the downtown lunch hour.

“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me,” I said.

“What did you just say?” The kid jabbed the knife a little closer and the bubble around us grew wider as the flood of people made more space. Everyone’s eyes were so intent on their destination, trying as hard as anyone could to not look at what was happening.

“You robbed me last week, kid. I still haven’t gotten a replacement wallet, let alone credit cards.” I pulled my pockets inside out to show him that I spoke the truth. “Rob one of these pricks instead,” I motioned with my thumb.

The kid looked skeptical, his eyes darted from my face to my outward hanging pockets then to the crowd. “You! Give me your money.” He jabbed his knife at another random making their way to lunch. They gave me a disgusted stare as though I was some puppet master for the kid and pointed directly to them while screaming for their sweet green cotton. All I could do was roll my eyes as I merged back with the crowd.

Thankfully the rest of the walk was uneventful and I made it to the closest sandwich place safe and sound. Eric was still in line, second from the front even. “Just the regular please,” I said as I planted myself next to him.

He looked at me with a strange expression. “Ah, no can do. Wifey said no more handouts.”

I stared for a couple of seconds. “What? Man, you know I’m good for it. The bank said I should get my new card by Monday. Besides it’s not like I’m asking for a hundred bucks, I just need lunch.”

“You don’t get it. She’s power hungry, took my cards away.” He flashed the inside of his wallet, absolutely nothing but a five dollar bill and several singles. “Sorry bro, I know I said I could get you, but I can’t.”

I ran my hand through my hair and scratched my scalp in a lame attempt to cultivate any idea. All I could think to do was nod at Eric as I turned and walked out of the shop. Before going more than five feet past the door I pulled out my phone and dialed my boss.

“What.” He always answered the phone like that when I called. As far as I knew I was the only person he “greeted” that way.

“Hey boss, I’m going to need an extension on my lunch break. I have to run home to…”

“No,” the way he talked to me was always short and to the point, but he rarely cut me off mid-sentence. “If you’re late, don’t bother coming back at all. Management is here now and they’ll be having a mandatory meeting on the hour. Concerning cut backs.”

“Yes, sir.” I wasn’t sure he heard me say “sir” before he hung up. “Fuck this.” The utterance drew a few looks from the peanut gallery. I made a face and nonchalantly raised a middle finger before walking to the bus station.

The digital readout above bus number 17’s stop displayed “5 minutes,” indicating how far away the next bus was. I stared at the bench for a moment before deciding standing would be better than sitting in chewing gum, bird droppings, and whatever liquid that was covering half the seat’s surface.

No more than two minutes passed before the display chirped, drawing people to look up at the words “Out of Service.” All I could do to keep from screaming was sigh and rub my eyes.

A thirty minute walk later had me laying on my couch, one leg over the back and an arm covering my face. A police style pounding on the door caused me to sit up with haste. No words were yelled, demanding entrance or claiming they were someone of importance, all they did was pound again. “Who is it?” My thoughts raced but the only reasonable thing that came to mind was the police finally apprehended that damn kid and they recovered my wallet. I rushed to the door and opened it while leaving the door chain secure. Before I could see who it was a hand filled my vision and a finger touched my forehead.

My eyes opened and I was sitting against the wall across from the door. A little man was closing the door from the inside. He turned about and looked at me, “I am so very sorry for that.” I attempted to speak but found that I couldn’t. “Ah, your expression says everything. Don’t worry, the effects are only temporary.” He sat on the ground directly in front of me. “I chose you. I’ve observed you for a little more than a year and have come to the conclusion that you are a man of honor and integrity.”

“Now what that means is, I have given you a power not unlike those you can read about in comic books. There is a force on its way to Earth that will inevitably enslave humanity and destroy the planet. I hereby charge you with…”

I found my voice, “let it burn.”

The little man’s words died in his mouth as it fumbled closed. He stared at me but I refused to say more. “Oh my,” were the words which finally worked their way free before he fainted.

pakap,printSF,1390649666.0,"Simulating a brain isn't just about horse-power. Brains have an architecture that's fundamentally different from computers, and that we don't understand enough just yet. 

Of course processing power helps a lot, but a bigger bottleneck, as I said elsewhere in this thread, is that our current brain imaging tech is simply not good enough to understand how the brain works at the neuronal level. We can measure electrical activity in the brain with a resolution around the cubic millimeter, which is not good enough, and we have almost no means of studying the *chemical* processes in live brains (neurotransmitters and stuff) that are likely to be just as important as the electrical ones. We're very, very far away from being able to ""hard-code consciousness"" in any kind of program.

That said, another huge resource that has arisen thanks to the Internet is Big Data. One of the traditional ways to do AI is what's called ""machine learning"", that is, having a program parse data and ""understand"" it through a set of rules, and the Internet has given us a HUGE data repository on every subject you can imagine. For instance, the SOAR project is trying to build an AI with ""common sense"" (aka solve the [Frame Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_problem)) by building an inference engine that's able to read Wikipedia. Watson is another example of this, and actually uses (IIRC) a local copy of Wikipedia to do its lookups."

ctesibius,Christianity,1390650165.0,"There is nothing in the Bible about masturbation. This is a very common activity, and wouldn't have been missed out or merely hinted at. If you read something like Leviticus in the OT, you will find that it is detailed and specific on all sorts of matters, and masturbation just isn't there.

Please also think about Matt 22:37-40:

&gt; 37 Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’[c] 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[d] 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”

If there were a law about masturbation, it would have to relate to one of these two great commandments - that's what verse 40 says. Yes, there could be circumstances when masturbation could relate to the second command - for instance masturbating when your wife wants sex might be an example. But those cases would be very specific, not a general prohibition."
pakap,printSF,1390650169.0,"There's dozens of ways to do that, the problem being that they test different aspects of intelligence. The older one is obviously the Turing Test (being indistinguishable from a human in text-based conversation). 

A larger, more useful definition might include, for instance, being able to react to changes in the environment in an adaptive way (ie handle the unexpected), or using experiences to infer general rules about the world. The problem with these (often adapted from real-life intelligence tests used to measure intelligence in animals) is that they require the AI to function in the physical world, and robotics ain't there yet. Machine perception is probably *the* hardest problem in robotics today. We know how to make an algorithm that can learn to recognize someone by his face (though robots are a lot less good at this than humans), but we don't have a general-purpose perception algorithm that would allow a robot to learn stuff about the world around him without being trained first. 

I've actually got a friend who's doing his PhD in machine perception, using a new kind of paradigm that needs a lot less pre-stored information about the world. He himself says that the first practical applications are probably a few decades away. Science moves slowly."

Then there are women who get what I'm saying, have their own opinions on common topics, and can occasionally change the subject to keep conversation going. This is by far the most common girl I date. Including some long term relationships.

Then there was the one girl I mention. With her there was never any need to think of a new topic. It was like when we talked we were at that perfect level of drunkenness where every conversation just meandered wonderfully from deep topics to trivial absurdities and everywhere in between. No topic was off the table, and she drank up all of my overthought opinions and replied with astute observations of her own.

I'm not saying that every other woman was awful, just that this one really stood out as really clicking with me, at least as far as conversation.

Tripi,sydney,1390650400.0,"There's all sorts of organised ocean swims in Sydney. I did one a couple of months ago from Bondi to Bronte, and there's one this weekend called the Cole Classic at Manly. 

If you can swim 2k in the pool without too much trouble, you should be fine doing the swims. There's usually a large group of people, who tend to be very friendly, swimming in a group. There are life guards sitting on surf boards along the course so there's help readily available if you get too tired or in any sort of trouble. 

I think the Cole Classic has a 1.5k and 700m course or something like that, so it's a good one to start out with. I'd highly recommend them. They can be a truly life-affirming experience. oceanswims.com.au also has lots of info for other swims around the country.

He made it a point to proudly pay for both our meals at the cashier and then proceeded to tell me over dinner how much he loves coming to the IKEA food place and that he treats himself to their Friday breakfast each weekend.

At this point, I think I still have a better innate eye for what is fashionable, but he knows way more about fashion than I do (rules, fabrics, style names, brands, etc).

Also, I think part of the reason he orders stuff without asking my input is because he doesn't want me to know how much money he actually spends on clothes. Good call on his part, because I would probably freak the fuck out if I actually saw the bills. Sometimes I seriously regret ever taking him shopping for new clothes.

As a rule, the more diverse cultural influences a culture has, the more interesting its music will become - just look at Cuba.

Bands who cross two completely different musical styles are often (not always) interesting - for instance, Sepultura integrated elements of Brazilian music in Death Metal (the intro of [Refuse/Resist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQdFcDY6dbQ) is a traditional *batucada* percussion call). [Tinariwen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinariwen) is another good example, mixing traditional Tishumaren (Tuareg) music with rock and blues.

Dry, with acne 

&gt;2. **Why I first started posting here:** 

I went off the pill, and my previously perfect skin became terrible. I hadn't had pimples at all in years, so I didn't even know where to begin.


&gt;3. **Location:** New Zealand


&gt;4. **Routine:**

&gt;Morning:
 At the moment I've been using Dove SPF 15 moisturiser on weekdays. I know it's not enough, but I'm not really outside for more than 10 minutes a day when I'm working. If I'm going out, I'll use clinique gel moisturiser followed by sunscreen.
&gt;-Sunscreen:
either neutrogena dry touch, or clinique city block.



&gt;Night:

&gt;
-Wipe make-up off with baby oil if I've used a lot, or I'll just use my cetaphil cleanser and nivea eye make up remover.

&gt;-Rinse face off with either Simple foaming cleanser if I've used baby oil, otherwise cetaphil.

&gt;-apply Differin gel.

&gt;-Apply Cetaphil for very dry skin moisturiser

I also have eczema, and I.use hydrocortisone cream sometimes, but mainly Fatty Cream which is paraffin, cetostearyl alcohol and some other things.

I'm a terrible goo hoarder so I've been trying to use up what I have. I have an AHA lotion from Silk Naturals, but I'm waiting until I've finished with the Differin, so I can treat the PIH/PIE. I bought stridex pads but I didn't find them to be much help, so now my brother uses them.

There were loads and LOADS of videos of people docking him (which is where you put your cock down someone's urethra) and he had some videos of masturbation/orgasm. Because it was mostly fluid, it was like, constantly at a 75% erect state and never really went up or down. His urethra was absolutely fucking enormous and it was quite comical to see him orgasm becasue the regular amount of cum comes out at the regular speed but obviously it has a lot further to travel and just kinda seeps out the end.

He masturbated by tying it up with loads of cord to try and simulate and erection and he'd then whack his cock onto his hand. It was weird but it apparently worked."

Even the stereotypes of the ideal Japanese woman, the [Yamato Nadeshiko](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko), say 

&gt;the nadeshiko is a wildflower at heart. A proper[ly done] yamato nadeshiko will show a subtle, but definitely present, touch of iron, in that she is unwilling to let circumstances hurt the ones she cares about or distract her from her goals or missions.

druccsula,getdisciplined,1390652998.0,"I went to therapy for this reason in the last year. I don't know if this helps you: my therapist made me think about the reasons why I escape and procrastinate. Because many times procrastination is not the ""disorder"" but the outcome. 

For example: Why do I watch netflix instead of making my homework? - Because it is hard. I think I will do badly. So why even try? - Why do I think I will do badly? - Maybe because I did not good in similar tasks. - But failing is a part of learning. Are you afraid of failing and why is that so? - Because when I fail my selfworth is sinking and I don't want that. - Why is your selfworth low?  

I could go on, but I hope you get the direction. For me it helps to think about why I do certain things. I boil it down to a feeling or unhelpful thought I am having. Than I check if the feeling or thought is justified and what I can do about it to make the feeling/ thought disolve in a better feeling/ thought. 

Break the cycle. Catch yourself in the process. Have little achievements and move on to bigger ones. 

Therapy helped me a lot. I highly recommend it to anyone. Good luck.   "

If I can figure out how to attach a microphone to my Raspberry Pi, I'll also make an intercom, because people have trouble hearing me through the door.

pakap,TiADiscussion,1390653683.0,"I'm French. My preferred form of social organization would be anarcho-syndicalism, but in the current context I basically am a social-democrat* - I supported a limited free market system with government-imposed checks, balances and regulations (mainly to prevent oligopolies, which almost always seem to turn up in any mature market), and I think utilities like energy, transportation, health or education should always be run by the state without profit concerns. 

I mean, it's hard to argue with the results - just look at British rail vs. French rail, or US education vs. Swedish education, or US health vs. every state-run health system. Sure, government-run sectors tend to bureaucracy and inertia - I work in education, so I've been confronted to the problems more times than I care to count. Still the lesser evil, though.

The problem is that even the big Left parties here are basically centre-right social-liberal ones, buying in the myth of austerity, monetarist policies and deregulation. That's in part thanks to the strong German influence on EU policy, which has in turn a very strong say on local politics.

""Thin, tall, anemic women"" apply for fashion and runway because that's what the industry wants. They don't want short chubby girls modeling their clothes because that's not considered beautiful, and models are supposed to show off the clothes as best as possible with their body. Most models are tall, there is not much market for petite models. 

There are other modeling jobs, such as athletic models, petite models, big and tall models, etc. The obviously won't pay as much (usually) but there is a market for them. 

But don't think anyone can get a fashion modeling job. One of the top models right now (Cara Delevingne, was a VS angel) was told by a designer that she was an ugly dwarf (she's 5'7). I've also had friends try out for modeling and even if they are already slim they are asked to lose an unhealthy amount of weight, or they are ugly pigs who will never get jobs. Definitely not self-selection. Honestly girls who aren't skinny and tall are just sparing feelings by not applying, because even tall and skinny girls are rejected.

Brightt,relationship_advice,1390654031.0,"For everyone saying he might have some trust issues, get over yourself, it's not always a case of trust issues. It might just be a case of him genuinely not seeing the problem.

I understand that you think it's annoying, and that you don't like it, but me and my SO are both like your boyfriend, in the sense that we will read each others' text messages, and often reply for each other. I often pick up her phone and read random texts, and she does it to me too, not because I have trust issues, but because I'm curious, and I often hope I can find something funny to tease her with. We're always upfront and never hide anything from each other when we do.

So, to him it's probably just a matter of curiosity and not understanding why you think it's a problem. Try to put it gently that you don't like it, and have patience. If he really, genuinely does not understand why you don't like it, it will take time for him to adapt. It will probably also help if you can get other people to talk to him about it how they agree with you, so he gets an outside perspective.

Now, one *very* important note when you ask someone else to give a second opinion that agrees with you, is *not* to make a point that it is, objectively, without a doubt, a bad thing, because he can just as easily find one of his friends who will agree with him, and you might piss him off (I know it pisses me off when my SO tells me one of her friends agrees with her, so she's right, and I'm wrong, arguments like that usually don't end well in her favor). You need to stress that when you bring in the extra person to give an outside perspective is to show him that *some people* don't enjoy it when someone does stuff like that, so it would be considerate of him to stop doing it, because it annoys you.

jarwes,raisedbynarcissists,1390654158.0,"My wife of 17+ years is also an ACoN and while we had some issues in the beginning we did understand each other and it's helped us to each deal with our own FLEAS and to overcome them.  We didn't have any children of our own (she has a child from a previous marriage) but I think that the fact both are afraid of 'becoming your parents' means you're aware of the potential problem and are willing to work against it.  That's a very good start.

Unfortunately your FLEAS will bleed out a bit no matter how you try to bury them, you will just have to work harder at killing them when they do appear.  Get some professional help if possible and/or read some self-help books.  Attend some group help meetings if any are around (al-anon is an example for children of alcoholic parents).  

Good luck and keep healing.  It gets better with time.  Being with my ACoN wife was the best thing that ever happened to me and I think for her."

Brightt,DebateAnAtheist,1390654711.0,"&gt;  If the shroud originated from Jerusalem, then it ceases to be a forgery, since they claim is that it is a burial shroud from Jerusalem.

If it was called ""the shroud that enveloped some dead guy in Jerusalem at some point in history"", then yes, proving it originated there would mean it's not a forgery.

The thing is, it is claimed to be much more. It is claimed to be from 1st century Jerusalem (which has been proven not to be the case by 3 different sources), *and* more importantly, it claims to have held the body of Jesus Christ, son of God, jadda jadda.

If you can prove it originated from Jerusalem, you still need a hell of a lot of evidence to prove it actually held the body of Jesus. Because as far as I'm concerned, proving the shroud is from Jerusalem, does absolutely nothing to make it more legitimate. It will just be some piece of cloth that might have held the body of a dead guy."

But I almost never got a headache when I took it.

Interesting that SSRIs can cause migraines, because they are often prescribed as a preventative. Just underlines how differently these drugs act in different people. Personally I found Lexapro worked well in that department. Low dose Prozac is also supposed to to work well. 

There are still a lot of drugs you can try.

Also click on the Prophylaxis section on the sidebar. 

There are the old fashioned things you can try like ice and massage. My mother had a vibrator she used on her neck. Sometimes wrapping your head in ACE bandages helps.

manslutalt,Thailand,1390655784.0,"&gt; We don't know for sure because the Thai government is doing everything it can to prevent the real data from being added up, but let's say it wasn't the norm, are you willing to suspend your morality because there's a 90% chance the prostitute isn't being forced into it?

I don't think there's a big conspiracy to cover it up. I talk to the girls, and none of them have given me any reason to suspect they've been forced into sex work.

&gt; In any case, I recommend reading up on the subject a bit. It paints a depressing picture. Thailand is considered the top destination for trafficked women and children.

Western moralists like to paint depressing pictures. When it comes to trafficking and sex slavery, most of the ""research"" is based on zero real evidence and most of the numbers are estimates, guesswork, or outright fiction. The definition for trafficking is also incredibly vague, which reflects the problems many people have in separating consensual work migration and consensual sex work from trafficking and sex slavery.

&gt; The agent returns when the girl is 12 to make the final payment and to pick up the “goods.”

As soon as I see a 12 year old sex worker I'll let you know. I don't doubt that they exist, but they must be hidden away *somewhere else* than the places I've been so far."

Canadairy,farming,1390656264.0,"I think he was referencing milk when he got talking about dairy. That being said, it was still a stupid comment. The fat content isn't grass fed versus grain fed. Our jersey's have grain as a part of their ration and our fat is almost always between 5 and 6%. Simply put, modern dairy cattle can't thrive without some grain in their diet. They can't take in enough grass (which is low in nutrients compared to alfalfa and corn) to keep their flesh on while milking so much. 

As far as keeping them on rotational grazing, we tried that. Dad found that even though the grass might look lush and green in September, the cows wouldn't milk off it. They just got skinny."

MyPetReptar,truegaming,1390656456.0,"This sounds like a new take on GTA. A lot if times what people will do is come up with a cool game idea with all of these innovative features, and don't get me wrong your idea is definitely cool and interesting, but they leave out the minor details of actually selling it and executing the creation. I understand this is probably a thought exercise but I still think it's a good point to make.

On the topic of your idea I hope you do not mind some constructive criticism as that's why you probably posted. First bad foremost I'm seeing your game but i don't understand what it is trying to be. Action and gun fights, so that must mean it's trying to be a shooter. Well now there is paper work? Okay how will that work? Will the play sit down and make a choice, or is it just them constantly reading and signing papers and gathering exposition?

Next we move to corporate takeovers, also a cool idea. Yet that still has some important questions: how much money does a corporation coat, and more importantly if the player starts off rich why is money a concern? How, in game terms, does the player even make money? If the player can buy a corporation what's the point of even doing a gun fight, or vice versa, if the player can simply go inking on the company and take it by force presumably more quickly than the other option then why would they not do that every time?

This me to my final critique. There seems to be the idea that the world should be filled with distractions ala GTA, however what do they really add to the game or narrative other than simply existing? And then how are you going to be tell the story of the main character and his stress, and how will you make it interesting?

Ultimately you have a good idea for a setting, character, and world, but it appears from what I've read is that the gameplay has not really been thought through. It seems like paper's please had an affair with GTA. In my opinion something like this might be better executed like a TellTale game. Heavy on exposition and character interaction with the world and other characters, but also will little action mini games.

2. They gave tylenol (you are supposed to give Advil for fevers, not Tylenol).

3. They gave a tiny dose of Advil, once, 8 hours ago (you are supposed to give the max dose, round the clock; there is no point giving your kids sub-therapeutic doses of medication because you are scared that meds are bad for them. wtf).

GetOffMyLawn_,AskOldPeople,1390656579.0,"Sexism. Well, you still see plenty of it, it's just not as oppressive and pervasive as it used to be. 

- As a child I was often told there were certain things I wasn't allowed to play with or certain roles I was not allowed to play. Like I was not allowed to be the doctor, I was supposed to be the nurse because ""girls can't be doctors"" per my 5 year old male friend. (My pediatrician was a woman.)
- ""She throws like a boy.""
- ""Girls can't rid boys' bikes"" because the earth would no doubt be flung from its orbit.
- The list goes on and on for this.
- Then you get to school and there's a whole new bunch of bullshit to deal with. Like girls could only wear skirts to school, polar vortex or no polar vortex. You wore to pants to school on a zero degree day? You go home. That finally changed when I was in high school.
- Certain sports weren't offered to girls, like soccer. No, you had to play field hockey. Ugh.
- In college professors would openly diss women in disciplines like math and architecture, like, Why are you here? Women don't belong here.
- At work you would get paid less to train men to do the same work you did. In general you got paid less. You weren't considered for certain positions.
- Sexual harassment was a common occurrence and HR didn't take it seriously. 
- In everyday life you deal with people who think you're a dope simply because you're a woman. I carefully explained to my auto mechanic what was happening with my car stalling out all the time. He didn't believe me and got the sequence of events completely backward. Ditched him. And the fucker knew I worked as a techie at a high tech company, that I wasn't a stupid person. 

The list goes on and on. Some of it was blatant in your face abuse, a lot of it was subtle and insidious. Things are better now but it still rears its ugly head.

I noticed in the OP you gave every item a monetized value. You should instead try to get into the mindset that the items shouldn't cost you a penny unless you're impatient and have lots of money to spend.

I got 2 BoCs on two toons, full beast gear and 3 TNH belts (including the screwdrivers) and my HI specs, all for free. I did this by talking to people, making connections and involving myself with various raid bots.

My first BoC was given to me by a friend that did a 4man beast and it dropped. I was part of the team and he let me loot it for free. Just because I was his friend. 

Another example is when I was just sitting in bore doing nothing and
another person I befriended in the game sent me a tell asking if I wanted yellow belt from TNH and 19m corpse timer. He was soloing TNH to farm intel symbiants. He didn't need the belt and shot me a tell.

Lastly, I needed HI specs for twinking and I asked if anyone in my org wanted to do an HI raid. I got a few org mates to come along and we did HI and I got specs for free. Just had friends help me.

If you make yourself well known and make friends in the game, you would be surprised how much free shit you get. Obviously, when they need help it's good mannered to go and do something for someone, knowing you aren't getting any loot at all. They just need you to help. It's a two way road."

mysled,AustralianCattleDog,1390656941.0,"We didn't crate train ours at first. It's been almost a year and now we're trying again, but it's going well. Here's what has been working really well for us. Keep in mind it's slightly different for an adult dog that is used to her freedom and is easily trained vs. a puppy, but the concept is the same. I will say I wish we had done it even though she doesn't chew up the house so much (she comes to work with me) because I think it will be really valuable for a slightly anxious dog for when she's weirded out by something (traveling, furniture moving around, etc). So it's especially important that she see it as a safe happy place.

1) Feed her in the crate (we started outside and are moving it further back) 

2) Teach ""go to mat"" [[1]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN76kcecTOs) [[2]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVGaslyGaGE)

3) Once it's solid, move the mat around and make a game out of running to it and laying on it. Then move it inside the crate. Don't make a big deal out of it and keep moving it around. 

4) Once she's happily going in and out of the crate, teach ""go inside."" This might take a while. Think the same as the mat training: initially reward for any steps into the crate, then up the ante so she has to get further and further in before she gets the treat. Keep it fun. 

5) Once she's willing to happily go in the crate and wait inside, start moving the door/zipper and treat her for staying inside while you open and close it

6) Gradually get her to the point where she's willing to go inside, lie down, have the door closed, and ""wait"" for a bit while you walk away without resenting the crate. 

7) Start leaving her in there for longer and longer times, until she's comfortable enough for you to give her a nice big treat for her to eat (like a bullystick or bone) with the door closed without getting upset. 

This could take weeks or months. You don't say how old yours is, but if he's a baby puppy he might not learn this so quickly. If he can't figure out the commands, you can at least still follow the motions with ""mat = treats,"" ""mat in crate = treats,"" ""crate = treats""! Think of it as you programming him :) 

EDIT: wanted to add that this sounds really complicated, but I'm working with an adult dog who is way smart, associates the crate with the car (which she hates), that lived outside for the first 9 months of her life (to the point where she's still more nervous inside than outside), and isn't food motivated. Puppy goofiness and desire for delicious treats will be extremely helpful and may make this way easier! It may even be as simple as getting him used to sleeping on a crate bed/mat, moving it inside the crate, and feeding him inside it all the time."

It actually made the rash worse so I went to the doctor... It turns out that I had a fungal infection (yeah I know, it's gross) and steroid cream was the worst thing that I could have put on it. The doctor didn't give me a prescription but recommended a very mild anti-fungal cream so I bought it, applied it and within a couple days my rash was gone.

tendorphin,creepy,1390657412.0,"If it was due to a pervasive issue, it could be very possible. Were he to have schizophrenia, for instance, he could have a continual, invasive voice telling him that he needed to kill his parents or else the voice would kill them in a much more horrible way, or it would continue to torture him in ways real or imagined. A simple voice doesn't seem like much, but when one has the disorder one doesn't know that it is an imagined thing. To them it is just as real as everything else, and often more powerful than real people (it must be if it's contacting them verbally often without any kind of body, so they think). Those without the disorder may also think that it would be simple to dismiss, but having a voice being so incessant, day in and day out, saying the same things over and over, even the most patient man may be brought to his knees. He could have easily loved his family, but killed them to save them, or himself, hence doing it as quickly as he could, and the immediate guilt that he felt. Having schizophrenia also sometimes mean that they don't know that they have it, even if they're told they have schizophrenia they still believe their delusions 100%, so saying he's worried about psychological risk could show that he has no idea that he's sick at all. 

EDIT: After listening to the call I'm more certain it is schizophrenia. Another symptom is often lack of affect, blunted emotions, etc. Granted, anyone would be in shock, but if he has the wherewithal to make the call, I'd assume he has a pretty good handle on what just happened, but is actually unable to express the emotions he may feel. 

EDIT 2: I listened a few times and am leaning away from schizophrenia but not ruling it out. Something else is definitely going on, perhaps a cascade of issues. His behavior says something relating to antisocial personality disorder, but the fact that he cared about ending the pain quickly may indicate something else. "

My first year of college, I was taking my laptop to the IT desk because some sort of software needed to be downloaded onto it for me to be able to use the wifi. I dunno. So in order to do this, I had to fill out a little form.

I was standing there filling out the form when a girl came rushing up with her laptop, totally distraught. It was near the end of the year, and she needed to be able to use wifi for senior finals stuff. The IT guy told her that I had just taken the last slot, and he couldn't take any more laptops.

""Oh man, that's so unlucky,"" I thought, still filling out the form. 

There was a pause, and then the IT guy said he'd make an exception and took her laptop.

""What a bro,"" I thought. I handed in my laptop and went on my way.

It didn't even hit me that what I SHOULD HAVE done was to say, ""Oh man! I'm the last spot? I don't need the wifi for anything important; you go ahead and turn yours in instead.""

First off, you'd better not screw up that process and take too much off, or create a jagged line or anything.  If you succeeded, you now have to shave it every single day (and continue to do it well), because if you don't, you end up with a really weird looking 5'o'clock widow's peak that will just look terrible.  And you'd better shave it really cleanly, because if you don't, you'll still end up with a shadow.  And eventually, you're probably going to get really sick of shaving it and decide to grow it out again, which means you have to go a month or more looking like shit, or buzz/shave your entire head down to the same length and let it grow that way.

The actual software that collected credit card data ran on the POS - the point of sale devices (in other words, the cash register). Target doesn't make their POS devices, but rather buys them. Any other retailer using POS devices with similar software is also vulnerable to the malicious code (which, BTW, is closely related to BlackPOS if you want to look up more info). 

The part of the attack that is, on some level, related to Target is the remote access the attacker had. They were able to get through Target's security between their internal systems and the Internet. I don't know enough about the attack to know how, but I do know Target knows how, and their system administrators, network administrators, and security experts have almost certainly closed down the methods used by this point. As a result, it's likely safer to use your credit card at Target, right now, than it is at other retailers that *haven't* been hit, as they likely don't yet have enough information to close the related vulnerabilities."

That said, retailers (online or otherwise) saving your credit card information is a security risk. It's a risk I'm willing to accept, because credit cards have fairly strong consumer protections and the hassle of having to re-enter every piece of data every time is more annoying to me than the hassle of card replacement the few times my information has been taken.

Just make sure that she has taken seven active pills (not the placebos) before she starts her placebo week. I.e. If she misses any pills during her third week (Jan 19-25) she needs to skip her placebo week and start her next pack on Jan 26.

My question is why a veterinarian would put down a perfectly healthy cat? Who was the vet?

RazTehWaz,AskReddit,1390658649.0,"Sorry for length, writing this all out in full was actually quite therapeutic so I got carried away.

I have Atypical Major Depressive Disorder. My depression never really goes away, it's always there in the background, but every few months I get a six-eight week period where things get a lot worse. Last August I was in the middle of one of my worst depression episodes yet. 

I had started hallucinating, both audio and visual and was finding it really hard to tell the difference between fake and real. I started having major anxiety (mine is normally quite mild), I was having panic attacks from questions as simple as ""what do you want for dinner?"". I started to lose grip on reality, and something that most people would brush off, say an offhand sarcastic comment, would be blown up in my mind until I was sure that person hated me.

I was angry, so so angry, for no reason. I'd blow up over the tiniest thing. I couldn't cope with life, I stopped eating, stopped talking to people, stopped all my hobbies. I couldn't concentrate on anything and just spent every day in a haze waiting until it was time to go back to sleep.

One night I had a fight with my mother. I was finding it hard enough to keep tiny things in proportion, so when she really did do something shitty to me I snapped. My Parents is awful with money, they split up 5 years ago, and my mother has moved out into a rented flat, leaving my unemployed dad with the mortgage. Obviously he couldn't pay, and repossession was threatened. My parents came to me, begging for money to keep the house, and thinking my father would be homeless if I didn't, I agreed. I gave my parents the money I had been saving all year to go on holiday with my boyfriend (to a music festival we both love and go to every year). 

Well it turns out my mother had the money to pay the whole time, she actually used the last of her money to pay it off, but still pretended she needed money from me. So she took my holiday money, and bought 2 tickets to the music festival I loved so much. Sounds like she's going to surprise me right? Nope, both her and my father go to the music festival using my savings. They lied to me so they could go instead of me.

When I found out what had happened I was so angry, so so so angry. I couldn't cope with that much emotion. I have very little memory of that evening, but the large amount of scars I have from it showed that I cut up my arms pretty badly. I also took 20 Oxycodone tablets. I was convinced that if my parents didn't respect me enough to not fuck me over that way, then I must be a horrible person and no one wants me around. 

I think anyone's parents doing that to them would feel pretty shitty, but with how unstable I was at that time (which they DID know about - my mother is a mental health specialist) I just couldn't cope and opted out.

Later that evening I was curled up in a ball, sobbing, when my kitten jumped up into my lap. He rubbed his face against mine, as if he was rubbing my tears away, and meowed at me. My other two kittens come over and they all curled up into my lap, purring. Knowing these three little creatures loved me and cared for me was enough for me to reconsider. I took a taxi down to the nearest hospital and told them what had happened.

They spent the whole night with me, just talking when I needed to talk. They called in a few favours and I got seen by a new psychiatrist very soon afterwards. I've started a new medication and I'm doing much much better now, I'm also starting therapy soon to help learn how cope with my depression and stop anything like this from happening again. I love my hobbies again, I'm hardly having any hallucinations, and my emotions are a lot more stable now. 

My three little kittens are now my three big cats, I love them so much and spoil them all the time. They saved my life, and they are the most pampered cats in the world."

silverionmox,changemyview,1390658851.0,"&gt; It is not equal opportunity unless you take into account all aspects of this debate. The idea that ""poor people should work harder"" and ""pulling yourself up by your bootstraps"" is completely ignorant of the issue. We are products of our upbringing. Of course you will have a range of what a person can do with that, but it is not as much as you would think. Some people in our society are disadvantaged because of their skin colour. Ignoring this compounds the problems.

This is not a matter of ""they should work harder"". You just can't expect everyone to go from rags to riches instantly. Connections, habits, relations etc. all contribute to success and those cannot be endowed to someone by administrative decree. It takes time to build up.

&gt;This analogy doesn't hold because there is no difference in ability of people of different races.

That doesn't matter, the point is that we can and do judge people on factors that are beyond their control.

&gt;So society can keep these people disadvantaged and claim ""colour-blindness"". See how this works?

Define ""society"".

&gt;Non-sequitur. This is totally ignoring the fact that these people are disadvantaged. We do not live in a society with equal opportunity. We can get rid of AA when we do not live in a society where racism is strong.

You will never get rid of racism with AA because AA *is* racism. It entrenches and institutionalizes the practice of allotting scholarships based on race. 

Why would people stop being racist if it's already 
paid and compensated for?

&gt;If you are agreeing that this should be the ideal situation, then why are you arguing against it?

It's like keeping your living room warm by stoking up the fire instead of fixing the hole in the window.

&gt;Also, do you believe that we should not have implemented AA in the first place?

We should focus on making admission and selection procedures objective... in more areas than just study. After all, what good does a degree do you if the bank is less likely to trust you with credit, for example? Making those procedures more objective has the advantage of preventing *all possible forms* of undue discrimination as well (being fat, ugly, short and not talkative doesn't help you either)."

 I bank with a major bank here in Canada now. Besides the profit sharing,  I get all the good and very little of the bad.

When you logged in the first time you choose to become an orc or dwarf, then are teleported to their starting area. The map was a custom map with about 120 layers of ground with a bedrock ceiling. Players had 1 home but no warps or teleportation. There were HUGE caves in the entire world + extra ores. Everyone spawned with 2 different saplings, and either carrots or seeds, based on starting faction. PVP was turned off, and the server naturally developed a playful hatred of the other faction. 

Neither of the servers are around anymore. "

I can watch dental stuff long as I know the person is fine.

His dentist was amazing. Every 5 or so minutes ""you okay my man?"" and he would give the thumbs up. If he wasn't at any time it was just a hand up and ALL work would stop. Like instantly. He explained everything that was happening before he did it. 

First time I was in that office was for 2 of his wisdom teeth removals. The dentist there tried to lecture me on how ""dentist visits are necessary"" and basically told me my anxiety was not something that should stop me from going to a dentist blah blah blah. This guy, just kind of went, ""oh okay that's cool maybe you're just waiting for the right experience"". So now I""m not so sure which dentist office I want to go to. hah"

yourdungeonmaster,rpg,1390659880.0,"I built a whole campaign around items with unintended consequences.  A few:

* **Bag of Holding**:  was one of a trio of bags of holding that all opened into the same non-dimensional space. In other words, they were sharing their stuff with strangers and vice versa. Took them awhile to figure out.
* **Dagger**:  Gave +1 to hit damage and added an extra damage die, seemed to tug at the target's flesh when the wielder withdrew it from the wound. Over time the weapon grew larger, eventually becoming a short sword, then a long sword, etc. The bonus and extra damage die went up as it grew. Eventually it turned on its owner.  It was a mimic.
* **Magic tent**: an invisible tent that allows 4 people to sleep in it with relatively little chance of discovery.  Also speeds up the resting healing process. Steals one random item from the combined inventories of the people sleeping in it, which it returns 1d6 nights later. People sleeping in the tent have vivid dreams of assassinations which featured the stolen items in some way (e.g., candles stolen by the tent were depicted in a scene of seduction wherein a seductress stabbed a king in the back). Turns out the dreams were of real events: the tent was made by a mage in the employ of an assassin's guild. It delivers items to guild members in need.
* **Ring of Protection**:  takes its job *very* seriously. Opposed Will save vs the ring occasionally required in order to be able to take risks like jumping over a pit. Failed save means the ring becomes so dense that it pulls the wearer's hand down to the ground and is unmoveable.
* **Talon of Vacchnor**:  This one led to a great series of encounters culminating with the party caught in a battle between two colossal gods. Technically the player gets a Will save - an easy one - to resist using it each time, but the player never asked for the roll. It's a talon (think Velociraptor-sized) that frightens anyone who views it for the first time (Will save applies). Subsequent viewings are just mildly disconcerting. The Talon also serves as a ranged slashing weapon *without leaving the user's hand.* Just make the slashing motion with it. Did 3d6 damage. It was a beautiful thing, so overpowered the player couldn't resist the temptation to use it early and often.  Meanwhile, every hit point of damage it did went to feed one of the old gods in its aeons-old slumber.  At each 100 hp interval, daemons were summoned as the god's heralds. At 400 hp, the god awoke and began its march across the lands to retrieve its talon, which got bigger and hotter and redder the closer the god approached.  Eventually it was too hot to handle and about a thousand pounds.  If Vacchnor gets his talon back, you're gonna have a bad time."

Yeah sorry about that I did not mean to confuse you, since there really are so many variations of Christians out there lol. I am just somebody who loves Jesus tries to follow him and spread some love. I was an agnostic who believed in evolution (didn't understand it fully) to a ""Christian (who does not understand it fully). 

Unfortunately the more I have been on reddit over the years I have noticed how there was this gap between science and religion. Since I can relate to both sides to a certain point it saddens me to think that so many people think they are mutually exclusive. It is however extremely kind of you to say that accepting evolution won't jeopardize my faith :D.

&gt; Evolution isn't intuitive. It has to be learned. So these people aren't idiots--they just haven't been properly taught the facts.

Pretty much sums up it up why I am here. What better way to properly educate yourself then going straight to the folks who know whats up and can point me in the right direction. The more I find out about it though the more complex it becomes and I have given up in the past and I just want to just for once get to the bottom of it. So that in the future I might be able to give a reply to somebody just like you did here with me. 

And before I ask you anything further I would like to understand my questions first before I bore you with them haha. For now I know I have some reading to do. I wanna thank you for pointing me towards the right directions.

screenmagnet,sex,1390660307.0,"First of all, any hormonal method where the hormones go into your blood stream will kill your sex drive. There is no better or worse pill for this. They will all do this.

Your options are either the copper IUD or the progestinIUD (Mirena or Skyla). The copper IUD will not kill your sex drive, and it will not do anything to your acne either way. But 40% of users have worse cramping on it than before. You also get heavier and longer periods (1.5x heavier on average). It lasts 10 years, and is small and easy to insert. And it may help protect against cervical cancer, so that's a bonus as well.

Since you want something that will help your cramps, your best bet is Mirena or Skyla. They have hormones, but most of the hormone stays locally, rather than entering your blood stream. The Mirena has more hormone than Skyla (the amount that enters your blood stream is about half that of the Implanon - the progestin arm implant). But there is enough hormone in your blood stream to cause side effects (fortunately one or these side effects is lighter or completely absent periods, and thus less cramping). Skyla has less hormone, and is smaller and easier to insert if you have not had a baby. It may have fewer side effects (such as decreased sex drive) but it also causes more spotting, and may be less effective at reducing menstrual flow and cramps. It also lasts 3 years rather than 5.

It's up to you to weigh the importance of increasing your sex drive vs reducing your cramps."

Obviously there are going to be health problems related to these processes. What are they, and why was it so valuable/preferable to take these risks?

* **Do you respond to those messages? Or do you find them distasteful or offensive?** I don't find them distasteful or offensive, I just didn't find the guys attractive so I didn't reply.

seanomenon,alcoholism,1390660367.0,"Yeah, you can make it work if you want. I realized my atheism while attending AA meetings. Even the most religious meeting I've ever been to has been primarily focused on sobriety.

A few things that have helped me:

+ [Agnostic AA meetings](http://agnosticaanyc.org/worldwide.html) are my favorite. Maybe there's one near you.

+ The [agnostic version of the 12 steps](http://www.aaagnostics.org/agnostic12steps.html) is also very helpful. I actually typed these out and slipped them into my big book. For me, they helped me stop bristling at the ""god stuff"" and see the practical wisdom in the steps.

+ In my experience,  meetings in community centers, hospitals, etc., tend to be less religious than those in church basements. Gay-friendly meetings also tend to be less religious, in my experience. The important thing to know is that AA meetings tend to have ""personalities""; its a good idea to try a bunch of different ones until you find one that agrees with you.

+ You will probably hear that ""your higher power can be anything"" from other people. Religious people in recovery love the phrase ""your higher power can be a doorknob"" for some odd reason. I never found that very helpful. What I came to for myself is sobriety being my higher power. ""What would sobriety do?"" (It sounds like a goof, but its a question thats actually helped me at times.)

+ I also do some mental substitution. Instead of ""higher power"", I think ""greater power"". I can easily picture lots of things that are greater than me. Instead of ""faith"", I think ""trust"". Trust in a program that has been helping people in my situation for 75 years. Even when I don't like what I'm hearing, I need some trust that it could also help me. 

+ When I meet the inevitable bible-thumper, or anyone who feels compelled to tell others they aren't doing it right, I try to remember that's just like their opinion, man. I don't see a lot of peace in people who feel the need to tell others what to do. I'm far more interested in the people who have what I want, peaceful sobriety. I've found those people tend to be a lot quieter about what they think.

I hope some of this helps you. Good luck."

- Bac S
- Prépa MPSI, Lycée Corneille à Rouen : jamais réussi à me mettre au rythme prépa donc j'ai enchainé sur :
- DUT Info à Caen, sans problème après la MPSI. Un bon dossier qui m'a permis d'entrer à :
- ENSIIE (qui s'appelait encore IIE quand j'y étais), école d'ingé. 

Après ça j'ai fait un stage dans un studio de jeux vidéo, expérience intéressante mais conditions de travail délirantes pour un salaire de misère. J'ai été travailler moins pour gagner plus dans la banque. Première mission pour Thalès Services (petite division SSII chez Thalès) chez BNP, 3 ans. 

Après ça je suis entré chez Soat sur les recommandations d'ex-IIE. J'ai vu une RH à mon premier entretien, qui m'a surtout expliqué comment ça se passait dans la boite : le recrutement sur profil, la formation pendant l'intercontrat, le suivi en mission etc. Le but est de voir ce que je savais faire et ce que je voulais faire. Pas de tests techniques mais c'est peut-être parce qu'ils connaissent bien la formation ENSIIE. J'ai eu un deuxième entretien avec un des deux cofondateurs. Au final on a discuté pendant une demi-heure de tout sauf de boulot, c'était une bonne surprise.

J'ai commencé par deux semaines d'intercontrat avant de trouver une mission chez Natixis (2 ans). Là je viens de redémarrer une autre mission à la Société Générale."

Del_Sol,Coffee,1390660531.0,"Ah, finally.  Another broke college redditor burdened with a cheap Mr. Coffee drip machine.  Personally, mines white, at least 5-10 years old, the most basic of the basic.  

You've already got the first step down, getting fresh roasted beans.  From this point on you can do four things to make your cuppa joe a thousand times better.  One, pour the water into your machine.  Gonna use the tap?  Think again, you can buy a gallon of water for a dollar, you'll immediately notice a difference if you've been using tap water.  Two, let the water circulate through the machine.  That spout that moves back and fourth?  Just let it sit over the water for a few minutes, this gets the water temperature up giving you a better brew.  Three, get a little warm water at the bottom of that pot, just enough to cover the class.  You don't wanna dilute your coffee, but you also don't wanna burn it.  FOUR (one of the best things I ever learned about using a drip style coffee maker), remove the pot from the coffee maker.  Now, weigh/pour your grounds into your paper/metal filter.  Move the spout over the grounds and just let the filter fill about half way with water, mix the grounds in with the water.  This is a night and day difference, your coffee goes from thin and meek to strong and bold.  Once it's about half way filled shove the pot under there and let that coffee flow out.  

At this point, you should be drooling over this compared to what you've had for the last few months.  But you said you like cappuccinos, which is ironic, because I was a broke kid with a Mr. Coffee machine that likes cappuccinos too.  

But you don't have a milk steamer, what are you going to do?  Get a jar, or any class container with a lid.  Pour in the amount of milk in there that you want.  Put the lid on and shake it like mad, shake it like Cartman shakes his shake weight.  Take the lid off (it's metal), and microwave your milk, usually about 30 seconds works.  Take it out, and you've got yourself a jar full of frothed milk that's ready to be poured into your coffee.  It's not as good as milk from a steamer, but on a scale of 1 to 10, if steamed milk was a 10/10 I'd give this an 8/10.  

At this point you should be pretty happy with what you have.  My next recommendation would be start going to your local goodwill or salvation army and begin scavenging for other coffee makers.  People have gotten pour overs, espresso machines, aero presses, percolators, for as little a **99 cents**.   Good luck!  Don't think you're doomed because a drip machine is all you have!  

EDIT:  A few more tips, I'm assuming you have a good grinder.  If not, get one, they're worth the investment.  Goodwill has them, ebay has them cheap, so does amazon.  Also, keep your beans someplace cold and dark, like a freezer, or for me it's a cabinet that stays around 60 degrees all winter long.  "

Msj2705,AdviceAnimals,1390660553.0,"Sluggish and buggy (and awkward!)

Oh, and the game selection consists only of EA published/funded titles.

Basically, Origin now is what Steam was at its launch 11 years ago.

not too harsh. if you don't like it that's a fair response. (though I don't think the second episode was that pandering, I do kinda wish they had pushed more of the pandering into the preview episode, it would have been a way to pander and not dilute)

this was a very different season. It makes sense that it will have it's detractors. So far it's been 2 on and 1 off with a running thread, but this time it was (arguably) 2 off and 1 on without an obvious thread. Heck this is possibly the first season i think we could argue the repeat of a motif.

Ordinarily if a TV show wanted to do a little switcheroo for the third season it wouldn't be that big a deal. But 3 minimovies every 2 years makes this more important than most TV shows."

GetOffMyLawn_,HaircareScience,1390661443.0,"I also have baby fine, thin lank hair. I use leave in conditioners. You can use Johnson &amp; Johnson No More Tangles leave-in conditioner on wet or dry hair. It works amazingly well. When my hair is wet I use Organix Extra Penetrating Oil which is made with argan oil. Not only does it detangle my hair but my hair has grown another inch after being the same length for years. Prolly due to less breakage.

Using a conditioner you rinse out and a leave in conditioner together produces even fewer tangles. In general I find that most moisturizing shampoos don't do much (although I do like Neutrogena Triple Moisture shampoo and conditioner, although not their leave-in conditioner). One thing that did work really well on my hair was Theraneem neem cleansing bar. It's full of oil so if you can't find that you might try an olive oil bar like Kiss My Face.

seanomenon,alcoholism,1390661581.0,"I've seen it. It's a very biased opinion piece masquerading as journalism. If you start with the stance that ""this is bullshit"" then that is what you will find.  

First of all, I personally doubt any statistics about AA, even when they come from AA itself. It is an anonymous organization with no central authority, how can they possibly have accurate success rates. 

Secondly, what about the person who attends some meetings, relapses, then comes back later. Was that first time a ""failure""? Or did the seed of an idea get planted?

Thirdly, anyone with long-term sobriety will tell you that it isn't an on/off switch. You make the decision to stay sober every single day. It's ongoing work, like a marriage. By that measure, my 5 or 6 previous failed attempts at sobriety are nothing compared to successfully choosing sobriety every day for 8 years, 11 months, and counting. I found the support of other sober drunks extremely helpful for this purpose, and I find that support at AA.

I also find attributing single goals or purposes to large organizations to be somewhat childish and misleading. Any large organization, be it a company, church, government, or fellowship, is made up of thousands or tens of thousands of people, each with individual opinions and agendas. This is true for an organization with a strong central structure like the U.S. Government or the Catholic Church, so it is even more true for a purposely non-hierarchical organization like AA.

AA isn't the only way, and lots of people achieve long-term sobriety without it or any other support group. More power to them. I appreciated the help, and continue to appreciate the support, that AA provides."

I think, though, that it's very wise of you to steer clear of addictive substances and recreational drugs - addiction is very hard to beat, and I think we aspies find it easy to get hooked on addictive substances due to compulsive behaviours. But mild analgesics are a godsend when you have a bad case of flu or tonsilitis. If you suffer hayfever, you can combat the runny/stuffy nose with aspirin (reduces inflammation in the sinuses) rather than taking 'jittery' allergy medications like those containing psuedoephedrine, but that can pose dangers if you are asthmatic or suffer from other respiratory illnesses so should only be taken after consulting with a pharmacist or doctor. I treat my hayfever (which is insane) this way so I can still go about my day without being super jittery.

Have you read up much on different types of drugs? Perhaps if you educate yourself better on particular classes of drugs, and individual drugs within the classes, you can help set your mind at ease about taking them when you need pain relief."

They asked a nearby local what the creatures were called.

&gt; Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.

jaredjeya,explainlikeimfive,1390662168.0,"I've upvoted this so more people can see this and explain the evidence in favour of Evolution.

Evolution does not:

1. Aim to explain where matter came from
2. Aim to explain or even support abiogenesis (the appearance of life from inanimate chemicals).
3. Disprove or prove the existence of a supreme being.

If you want to find out about 1), look to Physics and theories like the Big Bang theory. They have a lot of evidence, but we are nowhere near  as sure as Evolution. We've seen evolution in action - we provide an artificial selection pressure, such as an abundance of a food source that the organism cannot process currently, to a colony of bacteria in a petri dish and after a few weeks and thousands of generations the colony adapts to use the new food source. We can sequence the DNA and find that it's changed.

We aren't certain about every little detail of evolution - recently we discovered the epigenome, which is a system organism use to turn genes on and off, which can be changed during a lifetime, which we didn't know about before - or the path some of the earliest life forms took, since obviously the fossil record gets worse the further back you go. But we are certain that the way we got from the first life form (*not* from inorganic matter, that's for theories about abiogenesis) to humans was through evolution. We're about as certain of evolution's existence as we of gravity's existence.

Creationism, on the other hand, as absolutely no scientific evidence, only anecdotal evidence from a couple of cavemen living thousands years ago who scribbled some folk tales in a book that came to be known as the Book of Genesis. Also, be wary of intelligent design - that's a theory that evolution happened and it was all guided by God. That's just creationism in disguise!

Hope that clears up your confusion. 

PS - can I ask what part of the world you come from? I'd like to know where you could have grown up and been taught there was no evidence for evolution!

Donc la grosse différence entre les boites (à part le salaire bien sûr) c'est la façon dont elles gèrent l'intercontrat.

La sélection est un peu plus sévère à l'embauche, et on fait de la formation en interne (préparation aux entretiens, révisions sur les bases techniques) en cherchant la première mission.

La mauvaise réputation vient surtout de la pression sur les consultants en intercontrat entre deux missions. Ils peuvent t'obliger à prendre des congés (plus ou moins légaglement), à accepter une mission qui ne te correspond pas vraiment ou loin de chez toi, ou même te renvoyer si tu ne retrouves pas assez vite.

mmp31,politics,1390662302.0,"I think what constitutes ""necessities"" is is too much of a gray area and I think that the poor are intelligent enough to decide what those are, and should have the freedom to do so.  They should be able to decide what portion of their income they spend on food, what portion they spend on rent, healthcare, etc.  We don't need the nanny state treating them like children by telling them how to spend it.

When I say gray area, think of this.  With food stamps, you can't buy wine, because it is a food that has a drug in it.  But you can buy coffee, even though it's a food that has a drug in it.  You can buy a shitload of junk food, which most people would hardly consider a necessity.  And under the current system, if people want to sell their food stamps for drugs, there's nothing stopping them.

&gt;That sounds like a really douchy thing to say but think about it, if you're neighbor barely scraping by, needed your direct help to support their family with food, and after you give them money you find out they were spending most of the money on weed and alchohol, how pissed would you be?

I'd be really pissed, but you are falsely comparing two scenarios.  In your situation, I voluntarily engaged in charitable activity trying to help my neighbor.  In the welfare situation, the state held me up at gunpoint and threatened to kidnap me if I didn't cough up the cash so the state could give it to the poor.

Hypez,leagueoflegends,1390662782.0,"Two things to be careful of before you go all in:

1) Minimum age to be a paid pro in LCS/ tournaments is 17.  You have two years left before that happens.

2) League of Legends has had a lot of inner turmoil lately, mostly in the form of players being upset with Riot, but other stuff as well.

My advice to you would be to play by your parent's rules for the next two years (while still keeping up with your LoL mechanics/ knowledge), finish your highschool degree and if the LoL esports scene is still up then, go all in.  Stream 12 hour days of League, you will get popularity to become pro, make sure you know all of the other team mates are as serious as you are about LoL and you **will** become a pro.

If you can get challenger on League you aren't restricted to LoL as *your game*, if League is ""gone"" in two years, you have the mental capability to be able to play almost any other mouse and keyboard game that comes onto the market at a professional level.  

**Bonus:** Good league skills usually lead to good analytical thinking.  If LoL doesn't work out, consider Math, Engineering, Computer Science, Chemistry as a college major."

So any idea in your head that separate bathrooms is keeping rape down should be eliminated.Second, the reason we have separate bathrooms is for the same reason why people often request a doctor of the same sex (even gay people do this).

That said, I can give some general advice from what you did say. Asking someone out shouldn't really be extravagant or over the top, it should be casual, friendly and just an invitation to a relationship basically; it's the marriage proposals that people sometimes go over the top on. Depending on whether there is an existing relationship with this person the approach to asking them out will change. If you're friends then it can be brought up that you have feelings for them and are interested in them or even just outright asking them out on a date. However if you don't yet know the person then approaching them in as friendly a way as possible, maybe starting off with a compliment, then proceeding to ask for their phone number is a possible way to go about it.

Not sure if that really helps, if you could provide more info hopefully I can be more helpful."

sovietterran,AskReddit,1390662890.0,"One somewhat legitimate concern is there is a real bias in America, especially regulating administrations, against any sort of tobacco or nicotine culture. I mean yeah, cigarettes are bad and tobacco contains cancer causing substances, no one is disputing that. But there seems to be an acceptance in the regulatory and medical communities that it's enough to stop at ""it's got nicotine in it. Must be a bad thing for bad people. Ban it for the children."" And ignore any other factors. I mean, I'm an occasional smoker. I hate cigs, but I'll have a cigar or hookah anywhere from once every 3 months to weekly depending on the time of year and who I'm hanging with. I legitimately go months with zero nicotine, with no cravings. Everywhere you go though, you constantly hear there is no such thing as an occasional smoker. Nope, and anyone who says otherwise is a no good dirty liar. Should we run studies on occasional cigar use? Nah, I mean, who smokes fewer cigars than two a day? At least up until a few years ago at least, this was the norm for studies. A study had not been done on cancer risk for anyone below the threshold of a two a day cigar smoker. Polonium content hasn't seen much in the way of study either, even factoring in outlier groups like the Japanese. So yeah, it's a good idea to study the effects, and I honestly don't think anyone should HAVE to be around secondhand smoke or vapor, but I see why people fear the fda stepping in and banning ecigs based on the fact that it's hip and in style to do so to anything with nicotine. 

Tl;Dr yeah, the fda should look into it, but the smoker/vapor community is used to being subject to more emotion than subjectivity when it comes down to regulation of their hobby/vice/habits. It shouldn't be a surprise that the fda tripping over itself to test ecigs is being met with some groans. "

iamtryingtobegood,TrollXChromosomes,1390663032.0,"&gt; biased feminists

Yes, feminism is a collection of ideologies. I'm not sure what the hell you imagine an unbiased feminist to be - somebody who gives equal credence to ""men's issues"" and ""women's issues"" because, let's face it, sexism is over and there is absolutely no difference between being a man and a woman today?

&gt; Anita Sarkeesian who half the time lies and the other half of the time spews random BS

Really? I've watched quite a few of her videos and I think her arguments are well-reasoned, well-supported, and quite compelling. Care to give an example of how she is lying or spewing random BS?

Edit: Also, the point is not that feminists are ""better people"" than MRAs, which is what you seem to be arguing, but rather that the inequalities present in our society are such that men benefit far more than women do, and in the few places where feminists movement in the past have made women's lives easier, MRAs usually scream unfairness and bias in favor of women, when really what they are experiencing is a levelling of the overall playing field to compensate for the disadvantages women experience. This means that, regardless of which feminists or MRAs you can point out as not-so-great representatives of their movement, the fact remains that feminism is very very much needed while the men's rights movement usually misses the forest of inequality for the trees."

fatalcharm,AskReddit,1390663174.0,"A little while ago, in South Australia we had an ageing population.

There are so many intelligent, educated, hard-working people who live in third-world situations that would love to live in a quiet place like this (in my opinion, anyway) Instead, a ""Baby Bonus"" was brought in. The baby bonus was supposed to encourage people who are thinking about having a child, but were put off due to the cost of raising a child (even if you and/or your partner have good jobs, raising a child is still costly) and the money was supposed to be spent towards raising that child, but instead all it did was encourage the bogans who wanted big screen TV's and teenagers to have children.

If you're wondering how much an actual dollar from 1862 would be worth at an auction, you can expect a modest starting bid at around $10, as seen on a quick search at eBay.com. Also, there's some indications via Google search that some have been auctioned for as high as around $250.

(they would rather place them with family)Their mother may however, say no out of spite. If she does she is an idiot because they will go into temp fostering at the very least. If you  cannot/won't be allowed, I would see if you think any other non-alcoholic family member is willing to. 

I was on the reporting end of an alcoholic mom. Her son had been through horrible things at her hands. I volunteered to take him until she got help/followed the steps for CPS. If I had not, no one else would have volunteered and that abused boy would have ended up in the foster system which is much harder to get them out of. A foster family won't advocate for the child OR the mother to get proper help. A family member will. In addition, a young child can be led to believe this is just a fun little vacation with aunty (unless of course their removal is long term)

It is a really difficult choice, to even make that call (everyone is acting like it such a no-brainer but-the CPS does NOT mess around. Once they take your child, shit gets very serious) and I so often see people calling for someone to call CPS on someone for what they deem as ""bad parenting"". Bad parenting does not warrant intervention to this level. However, addicts are addicts and all of their actions are in line with their addition. In this case, neglect and abuse.

Please call. Please try to be strong. This will not be easy. Best of luck.

ETA: It makes your case easier if you call while she is actively drunk. If the police arrive (which is who they send in that instance) and find her out of it drunk, there won't be a bunch of ""visits"" as follow up. They will take them more or less on the spot. "

I do agree that there should be a legal right to paternal surrender, though- I think it would change the dynamics of pregnancy within relationships BUT it would also allow for shirking of the mutual responsibility that is having sex in the first place. It takes 2 people to make a baby, right?

Even so, if a woman so chooses, she doesn't have to list a father on a baby's birth certificate. Until they completed a paternity test, my son's father wasn't listed on his (then he paid to amend it himself- he also paid for the paternity test, as we'd broken up before I found out I was pregnant). I also gave him the choice to be involved when I found out, but that was because I chose to keep my pregnancy before talking with him about it.

What's interesting to me here, though, is the added complication of biological imperative and motivation: men are wired to want to spread their seed while women are wired to be grounded and monogamous generally. The idea of paternal surrender when framed in this way becomes problematic, no? A guy just wants to make as many babies as he can without the responsibilities of raising them or financially supporting them AND HE CAN?! Hellz yeah!!

Granted, this idea was helped along by a particular episode of SVU wherein a guy targets pro-life women, sabotages their birth control and deliberately impregnates them (he even has a chart of all the women's cycles he's juggling), so he knows they won't abort his offspring. He pays child support to all of them (there are many), but is a wholly absent father.

* Join as many clubs as you can without overwhelming yourself at the expense of your grades. 

* Meeting people and having a good personality is just as important to colleges as grades. 

* Have some leadership positions as well. Don't just join a club, perhaps be the treasurer as a freshman and then president as a senior.

* Perhaps join a sport like cross country or tennis, even if you're not very good. It's exercise and it's a bullet on your resume. And again, meeting people.

* Your grades are crucial.

* Find a mentor in the school. Most likely a teacher, a coach, a principal. They got in their profession to help people and it makes them feel good. Be a student that they'll never forget. Don't do this in a sycophant way or in a pitiful ""will you be my friend?"" way. Make it genuine. You'll know when a mentor legitimately cares about you. I'm 37 and my mentor was 37 when we met (which is kinda weird). I will be at his surprise 60th birthday party tonight.

* Your grades are crucial.

* Stay out of trouble in terms of drugs, pregnancy, detention, fistfights, drinking, smoking, and so on. What feels good in 2014 won't be so great when you're 40.

* The best pickup line for females of any age is ""Hello my name is"".

* Volunteer work and/or a part time job. Meeting people, maturity, responsibility, handling money.

* Definitely get a summer job. Harvard isn't looking for people who played video games for 14 hours a day for 90 days straight.

Since, compared to many females of the time, I'd be considered a beauty (straight white teeth, good complexion, pale, healthy weight, small and delicate features other than my big eyes...) I'd probably be able to hook a wealth man at least as a mistress   Maybe I could get Henry VIII and then be smart enough to back away with respect when his eyes finally lingered elsewhere. It's terrible to say this would be the route I might consider taking, but women were really really limited.  Although this isn't my period of experience (archaeologist) it's safe to say that this might be a possible route to take.

Barring that...I'd get myself to a nunnery.  I think nunneries were declining in popularity but it would be a place that a literate female who valued learning could go.

The top, for women, wasn't very high.  Having some of you own property, being safe, and also being respectable were pretty high markers.  You were either chaste or a mother and if not either than you weren't doing well.

Paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,AskMen,1390664045.0,"Most of us are very very good at hiding in plain sight. Obviously we can't go through life letting everyone know how much we hate ourselves, so we hide it behind a great social life. 

Well, guys like me, anyway. Everyone is different. Personally speaking, I've slowly developed a great social life to compensate for the complete lack of romance and sex in my life. And when you're surrounded by a group of friends at most times, people won't ask stupid questions as much. Even better, most of my friends have figured out that I'm the one who's incapable of getting into romantic or sexual relationships and will defend me if I'm called out on it.

Probably applies to women too (who am I kidding, it definitely does), but there's no greater shame to an American man than to never have any romantic or sexual relationships. It's a secret about myself I keep very well. I'm a pretty private individual to begin with, and I don't really tell people a whole lot about myself, so people don't ask questions. 

So sorry that we're hard to find, but we can't take the kind of risk it would take to find someone like you. The mass cultural shame alone is reason enough to hide our dark secret from everyone else. "

goundo,TrueAskReddit,1390664072.0,"Organizing a bunch of adults with busy lives to travel in a group for their hobby on a regular basis seems unlikely. So, solo or duo sports are probably your best bet. Road biking is a good one. Maybe marathoning, too. And once you've got a few marathons under your belt, ultra running.

From personal experience, I would suggest rock climbing. If you like competition, there are bouldering and sport leading comps at rock gyms across the country every weekend. If you are a real competitive masochist, you can sign up for 24 hours of horseshoe hell, at horseshoe canyon in AR. Many climbers are perfectly happy pulling on plastic and touring comps for years. But eventually, you will go outside, which opens up a whole new world. If you want to travel to see great cities and cultures, you may be disappointed at first. Instead of a quirky local ethnic restaurant, you'll be eating gas station roller dogs and peanut butter straight from the jar. Instead of going to a bar with 50 microbrews and live local music, the only bar for an hour around will have deer heads on the wall, a juke box that hasn't been updated since 1987, and a choice of PBR, Bud, and Bud Light. But it is all part of the experience, and the great climbing destinations, IMO, are a more worthy attraction than the great cities. From the beautiful sandstone of the Red River Gorge, to breathtaking desert sunrises on spires in Utah, to the towering glacier-polished granite walls of Yosemite. And once you run out of places to climb in the US, the rest of the world awaits: deep water soloing in Thailand, adventurous alpine ascents in Patagonia, super classic lines and via ferrata in the Dolomites, and making first ascents in places unknown on the relatively unclimbed Dark Continent.

Yep. I would definitely recommend climbing."

No woman ever puts ""asshole"" on the list of traits she looks for in a man, but every woman has dated and stuck with one at some point.

ctesibius,Christianity,1390664403.0,"Jesus did say that we are not supposed to look on women lustfully, and that this is the same as adultery. This doesn't relate specifically to masturbation.

This means over-stating a point to a ridiculous degree - e.g. ""if your eye causes you to offend, pluck it out, because it is better to enter the kingdom of God blind..."" - that doesn't mean that you should blind yourself. Hyperbole is not a literary device which we use very much these days, so you have to consciously bear in mind that Jesus may have been using it rather than speaking completely literally.

I would *suggest* - and this is only a personal opinion, which others will disagree with - that you take this to mean ""If you look at a  (?married?) woman lustfully, and would have sex with her if you could get away with it, it's no different from actually committing adultery"".

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390664639.0,"I agree with /u/JohnEngland. This is about fear of failure, fear that you won't be able to make the life you want.

Failure does not rob life of its magnificence.

You are young right now. Youth can be fun, it certainly has its upsides.

But do you know what really could ruin life?

If everything that lays ahead of you is exactly what you want. 

You have only experienced what you have experienced. You are only aware of what you aware of. You can only interpret the the things you aware exist within the small context of your experience.

There is SO MUCH MORE to life than however large your sample could possibly be.

There are things you know about, but cannot understand because you currently lack the perspective needed to understand them. Then there are other things you would not believe were true despite any evidence to the contrary.

Take any strategy game, chess, risk, settlers of catan, many card games, etc. When you play, you generally are trying to win. You read the rules, try to set things up so that, based on whatever ""hand you're dealt,"" and what you can predict others will do, you can win.

But unless you have played that game many, many time, and know the people you are playing against very well, it is difficult to predict how it will go. The game becomes fun, challenging, because it is now surprising. It remains fun to play, even if you end up losing. Once you know everything so well that it is not surprising, not challenging, it really isn't fun at all anymore.

Now, sometimes the hand life deals you is so bad it seems there is no possible way to ""win"" no matter what you do. You literally cannot envision, given what you see, any possible outcome you would consider a win. I have been there.

But here, again, is where that view, although horrifying to have, is really inaccurate. It could very well be true that, within the small circle of life you can see, nothing you can do will matter, you are doomed to a life you don't want. But you only see a small circle. If you change that circle, you change the rules of the game, and that crap hand you're holding could become a great one.

""Changing that circle"" could be something like moving to a different culture, surrounding yourself with a different type of people. Or it might mean taking on completely different habits. Or changing your physical body. Or changing your work, or hobbies.

Failure is actually an asset in many ways.

If everything keeps going well, if you literally never stumble and day to day the path is smooth beneath your feet, you might never question the circle you are in. You have no reason to look to see what else life has to offer.  You could very well miss out on the one thing that would actually produce in you true happiness. And all because it never occurred to you to question what you have.

Failure is good. At least occasionally. If it is only occasionally, (even if it is a BIG failure), failure provides us something to struggle against. We are meant to deal with conflict. If it is not naturally occurring, we see it where it doesn't exist, or create it in superficial and funky ways.

Failure either hones you, creating a better you than you would have thought possible, or it guides you, away from things that don't suit you and towards things that do.

Do not fear failure.

You will fail sometimes. Sometimes it will be big, and it will hurt. But a life without failure is the most boring, torturous thing I can imagine.

so if she doesn't understand you, do you feel like you've explained it right? do you feel like you understand her?

so what are you doing to give her what she needs out of the relationship? what do you think she needs? is she getting that?

&gt;She doesn't want to, she says she gives me sex to keep me happy. So yeah, she GIVES me sex as she puts it but its no where near as often as I need and since she is just GIVING me sex and not wanting to have sex with me it feels so hollow and empty.

so why doesn't she want to? what changed? and what are you doing to change that?

&gt;About six months ago it seemed like things were picking up. It was a good month, sex once a week. Sometimes a couples times in a day. But that was short lived.

so why was it different then? was your relationship different? did she have less stress? more vitamins? did you have more/less time together? did you do more chores in the household that month? 

&gt;Now I don't care if she gets mad. Why should she get what she wants when I don't get what I want?

how do you think that that will affect the situation? what do you think of your own attitude towards her?

T - check &gt; bet &gt; check-fold

R - check-call &gt; check-fold

I know the sample size is small, but villain isn't very aggressive - so I would be hesitant to put a lot of chips into the pot after he calls a post-flop bet.

He might be too passive to raise the flop with a King, especially after you raise pre-flop.

Hands like K9s, KJ and KQo are all in his wheel house, too. Same with pocket 7s and 8s - all of which are perfectly capable of flatting your c-bet.

This is not a good hand to turn into a bluff, either. JJ can be good here a lot of the time, but it's not a big pot hand. A better line would be to just throw it away, or switch to a much more passive mode which would give worse hands a chance to put some extra money in, not to mention also substantially softening the blow in the hands where you get out flopped.

Cash games are about hedging your bets not just according to the strength of your hand, but also in such a way that minimizes the amount of money that your opponents can win off of you.

In this situation, sure you might have the best hand, but you got greedy with it. So now any time your opponent flops a better hand than yours, the pots you lose to him are going to be massive. That means, you'll win what's in the pot when villain folds to your c-bet and then your check-raise on the turn, but those pots will be inconsequential compared to the pots you lose when you're beat, having been forced to risk all of your previous winnings on a single check-raise on the turn - and then even more when you justify calling a re-raise ...while drawing to 2 outs.

Bluff with air instead, and try to avoid turning a little bit (of equity) into something that it's not.

You might also be served well by setting standards for the relative strength of the hands that you need to be willing to play large pots with, i.e. KK+ pre, two pair+ on the flop, sets+ (assuming no draws came in) on the turn and beyond.

Imagine a scale, hand strength running along the bottom and pot size running up the size - the bigger the pot gets, the stronger your hand needs to be.

If you are check-raising this turn, you should be ready to fire another barrel after you get called - otherwise you shouldn't be raising there at all (with JJ)."

Cykuta,RichardArmitage,1390665072.0,"I do hope Richard won't spoil other performers for you - but he can do that. I really enjoy Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"", for example, and the performance Mark Strong gives is very good, but I still can't shake the feeling that lord Blackwood should have been Richard. The film would be about 1000 times better and oh gods what a marvellous lord Blackwood would he make.

I remember reading Richard had to find Thorin's voice back again when they re-shot some scenes and it took him some time. He also said that in a costume with a lot of prosthetics and makeup and stuff voice work becomes more important because other means of expression are limited, so it's lucky he can do all these amazing things with it.

I wonder if this can be learned somehow, if you can hire a coach that will teach you to change the way you speak at will.

&gt; I just had the idea to make a list of all the interesting things said by Richard or about Richard in the specials of the Hobbit and came across this one, which fit great in here

If you took the time to do that, it would be absolutely awesome! There's no way I can watch specials other than what makes its way in here, usually in snippets."

You can always find used welders for around $200-$300 on Craigslist and stuff. I would advise you to go to school to get some kind of a welding certification. In my state (GA) if you graduate from a HS in the state you can go get as many certificates as you want all for free. Check into that in your state.

Petunia_JAK,infertility,1390665736.0,"I'm a bit confused. Maybe somebody with PCOS can chime in, but my understanding is that not everyone with PCOS has cysts on their ovaries. Do you not ovulate regularly? If not, you basically meet the criteria for PCOS, unless there is something I am missing. I'm also honestly a little doubtful a fibroid less than 1cm (which is very tiny) is causing you to have really heavy periods. 

I would recommend seeing an OBGyn or an RE, and not a GP to try and diagnose something like this. 

Going by the Rotterdam criteria you would have PCOS:
Rotterdam

    In 2003 a consensus workshop sponsored by ESHRE/ASRM in Rotterdam indicated PCOS to be present if any 2 out of 3 criteria are met[20]

    oligoovulation and/or anovulation
    excess androgen activity
    polycystic ovaries (by gynecologic ultrasound)

as well as this criteria:
Androgen Excess PCOS Society
    In 2006 the Androgen Excess PCOS Society suggested a tightening of the diagnostic criteria to all of:[7]

    excess androgen activity
    oligoovulation/anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries
    other entities are excluded that would cause excess androgen activity

and even the NIH criteria:
NIH

    In 1990 a consensus workshop sponsored by the NIH/NICHD suggested that a patient has PCOS if she has all of the following:[19]

    oligoovulation
    signs of androgen excess (clinical or biochemical)
    other entities are excluded that would cause polycystic ovaries

I was with you until you said this, you also are stating the obvious. Both terms are euphemisms, it works both ways. Pro-choice for those that wish to believe it's a matter of choice, and pro-life for those that wish to believe it's a matter of life and death. Pro-choicers aren't going to call it pro-murder and pro-lifers aren't going to call it anti-choice because both of those sound offensive.

If I had the money to go to a salon every two weeks for regular touch-ups, I'd rather do that. I'm definitely not going to box-dye my hair ever again because drugstore dyes are terrible for your hair, and I don't know enough about chemistry to be confident that a particular dye won't melt my hair or turn it green. (Also, boxed red dyes always faded to brassy nasty orange anyway.) 

Henna's the only way I maintain get a believable shade of red that won't destroy my hair/wallet. Unfortunately, It's permanent as fuck and you can't just bleach it out the way as you would with salon color, so I can't change my hair color...ever. You win some, you lose some, I guess."

ShamelesslyPlugged,AskMen,1390666236.0,"Here's how I think of it. I'll use a made up version of MacDonald's as my experimental model.  

To make a profit, your revenue needs to exceed your cost. Increasing the minimum wage increases your costs, thus lowering your revenue. At this point, you have two choices to try to maintain a steady revenue. You can either reduce the numbers of workers you have and hope that they can maintain a similar level of productivity to lower costs, or you can increase the cost of your goods.  

The former leads to less workers, and the latter leads to inflation. Now, that's vastly oversimplified. I'm no economist. If the level of inflation is less than the increase in wages, then everyone wins, I guess. I don't know exactly where the pendulum swings. My point is more that I don't think that increasing wages necessarily solves things."

I have just a high school degree but have a great job as a electronics tech and make pretty good money but no where near what she does. It makes no difference if you love each other. In fact her family who all have college degrees and her father a phd are not judgmental about it at all where my own family loves to make snide comments about my education (my entire family having at least bachelors but most graduate degrees). Judging people based on their education level from either direction is a sure fire way to miss out on great people. I have met plenty of people who are judgmental about my perceived lack of education. I have met many more who could care less. I would never rule someone out as a potential partner based on that. What's more important. Will she be a good mother to our kids? Is she a good partner? Do you share the same goals in life? Do you laugh together? Do you have amazing sex? I get that it can be a sore spot for some people not having a college education and being judged on that by some people. If you are doing well in life without it who gives a damn though?

The spells on it are one that makes it flaming; added fire-damage, can ignite stuff, and in desperate times be used as a torch etc. But the thing is that the entire sword get heated up, not just the blade... Which is why the second spell, a fire/heat protection spell, is also in there. Now the thing is, to activate *both* spells, you have to spend more mana than a non-magic user generally have. But spellslingers are rarely proficient with swords... So, it IS a good item, but you have to make some workarounds for it to be used with its full potential. It was rather funny. :-)

Edit: oh yeah, when you hold the sword you get a feeling of two non-local points that are clearly related to the sword (yeah it's weird, but that's magic for you) and that you can *focus* on one or both of these points. If you do, mana to fuel the spell/s are drawn from you. It might be useful to point out that in my game, in you lose all mana you pass out; that happened a few times..."

Exis007,relationships,1390666724.0,"Okay, this is a boundary issue and that worries me. It worries me because having good boundaries is really important and you seem to struggle with them a little bit which I think is normal after a serious abusive relationship. That being said, if you're feeling this much turmoil one thing you might want to put on the back burner of your thoughts is whether you want a relationship right now. Do you REALLY want to jump back in when this is pain is all fresh? How does this set back your personal healing? I don't have an answer for this, but I think it is an issue you might want to look into. 

As for when to talk about your past, you have options between ""say nothing"" and ""tell all"". 

Exes one and two seem like pretty normal dating experiences for young, inexperienced people. It is the third ex that worries me. 

So what do you say? You say a little and then you ask (because you have good boundaries) to tell the rest of the story later. You can say that you've had three major relationships. You can say that the first one was when you were still in HS and it was basically a HS relationship. The second was a two-year thing that just grew apart and ended a little messily. Then you say that your last relationship was really abusive and you leave it there. You can/should tell that whole story when more trust has been built but you don't owe the gory details to a guy you just met. That's for a relationship that is headed in a really serious direction. You just are getting to know this guy. 

It's not about keeping/hiding the truth, it is about disclosing the LEVEL of truth appropriate to the depth of the relationship. He doesn't need to know you were smacked around or that your ex tried to kill you. That's for when you're getting serious with him. He might deserve a accurate but vague outline of your dating history enough that he gets enough of an idea about your history to not be super curious. "

Not only can this not work, but it SHOULDN'T work. She needs to be healthy before she can properly contribute to a relationship. It's not your job to be a savior. "

From what I've read, Congress has approved a budget (2.5 million) to run a referendum, which is the next step in the process. If the referendum is in favor of statehood, then PR will be able to petition Congress for full statehood. They will then be required to adopt a constitution and form of government compatible with the US Constitution - I'm not sure but I believe that's already what they have. The both houses of Congress need to vote to accept the new state. Then the President signs the resolution and it becomes official.

What this article ignores in making their title statement is the mechanics of the athlete producing the counterforce also introduces their faults that result in wasted energy.

So looking at a diagram of the bar path is all but useless without seeing the athlete themselves and their position during that lift.

Vroonkle,explainlikeimfive,1390666822.0,"I'm a sailor on a large US Navy ship. There are several very important factors in a man overboard scenario. Local aquatic life (sharks, sea snakes, etc.), time of day, water temperature, geopolitical climate, just to name a few. Best case scenario: it's a clear day, the sea is calm, and a chopper or recovery boat is launched under 5 minutes. You spend maybe 15 minutes treading water, no predatory creatures pursue you, and a swimmer can reach you. Worst case scenario: the seas are rough, it's night time, there are sharks nearby, the chopper/boat crew are on standby, and your ship can't risk an attack. It could take up to 45 minutes for a successful rescue. Maybe never. Impossible case: no one sees you, you don't have a water activates signaling device, and there is no response at all. 

A large ship is loud; there won't exactly be a splash you could easily hear from the deck. I've seen a pallet of steel weighing over 500 lbs hit the water, and the sound was completely muffled by the ship. Not a sound from 500 pounds of steel landing flat. Compare that to 180 pounds of person. 

We've been blessed to recover 3 of 3 in my time out to sea. I have heard plenty of sea stories that involve sailors disappearing in the night, and their absence not being noticed for 6 hours or more.

 The worst story: a young man fell over a life line during a hard turn, in broad daylight. 6 people saw this kid fall. They had a boat in the water in 4 minutes, and HE was a qualified rescue swimmer. He never came up. No one saw him after he fell, and the response was IMMEDIATE.  He was never found."

TheCryptic,electronic_cigarette,1390666992.0,"&gt;**Drip tips?** 

Your tank should come with one, so you shouldn't *need* more.  Basically a selection of drip tips let's you choose the ones you like be for feel, bore (which can effect airflow slightly) and the like.  Do NOT put juice down your drip tip in a clearomizer like a Protank, the only time to put juice in a drip tip is when you're using a dripping style atomizer, not something with a tank.

&gt;**More juice?** 

You will need more juice eventually.  How long 30ml will last depends on too many factors.  When I started vaping 4 months ago with some Vivi Nova tanks and a Protank I as going through about 3ml a day. Now I prefer different hardware and go through 6 or 7 ml a day.  If I find a juice I really like I can easily vape 10ml in a day.  So for me a 30ml can last between 3 and 10 days.

&gt;**Spare .. stuff?** 

The MVP has it's battery hardwired into it, so you don't need batteries.  Of course I do recommend having a backup of some sort in case something happens to your mod. Coils and wicks are something you'll go through.  In the case of your clearomizers, you mcan buy ""heads"", which are preassembled coils and wicks that you use to replace the ones you've been using.  Most people find that they can get a week or maybe two out of a head.  You can save money in the long term by learning how to rebuild the heads you already have.  That requires wire, wicks, some basic tools, and a bit of patience and time.

&gt;**A second MOD?** 

You need a backup unit, nothing lasts forever.  Personally I like to have a backup for my backup.  Beyond that, you can collect them as a hobbyist.  Some mech mods are stunning.  I like to pick an atomizer and mod combination that look nice together, like picking shoes to go with you shirt or something.

&gt;**Anything else?**

It sounds like you have what you need for day one.  What comes next is up to you.  Some people don't like to fidget and play around, and your basic kit (plus juice and heads) might last a year or more... Basically until the battery stops working or something physically breaks.  I prefer to try everything, so I'm four and a half months in and have dropping well over $900 in juice, hardware, and rebuilding supplies...  And it's still cheaper than smoking.

Megawatts19,Saints,1390667028.0,"I think we need to take offense the first 2 rounds. People are talking about safety and CB help, but next year we'll have Raffy Bush, Vacaro, and maybe Jenkins back. Then we'll have Lewis, White, and Robinson at CB with Greer coming back (hopefully) about 3-4 weeks into the season. We'll also have Victor Butler and maybe Parys Haralson back along with Galette, Jordan, and Hicks. I think we will be more than good on the defensive side. The depth issues we have there I think we need to address in free agency.

We absolutely need a WR and OT in the first two rounds. We need depth badly on the offensive side. Graham got victimized in the second half of the season with bracket coverage and physical off the line coverage because defenses knew they could man up on our WRs. Marques can only get open in zone coverage. He's just not fast out of his breaks anymore. Lance is a walking injury. Meachem has lost several steps, and Stills has very poor route running. We'll get Joe Morgan back but I'm not convinced he's our answer as a deep threat. I think Kenny Stills will be our Lance Moore from here on out. I think Moore is gone."

If you want power with a solid tranny and not much fabbing get a B18c1 swap.  They put out around 170bhp and have a short geared tranny.  

Most Honda guys tend to build their own engines.  There's a popular one called the LS/vtec, it's a B18b1 bottom end with a B18c1/5 or a B16b head.  It typically puts you around 200bhp.  

If you're looking for something with a little more pep than your D series but want to keep it really cheap swap in a B18b1.  You can find them for around 300 bucks, usually with a tranny.  They put out around 130-140bhp.  With a little more torque than your D series.  If it's still not enough for you you can get a short geared tranny from the B16a or the B18c Type R.

There's plenty of forum posts on people doing D to B series swaps.  I personally have a B18c Type R in my 94 Del Sol Si, it originally had a D16 in it.  But at this point a B18c Type R practically costs the same as a K20 swap.  "
incogito_ergo,financialindependence,1390667469.0,"Man, I can't ever remember a time in my life when I've felt like I had too much free time or was bored and didn't have anything to do.  I can't conceive of a circumstance where I would ever have time to finish everything that I want to.  

I wonder how much of that comes from personality type... I was reading a (small, statistically invalid, but still interesting) study on FI and its correlation with MBTI personality type, and like 50+% of FI folks are INTJ or ISTJ, two personality types that tend to do very poorly without forced social interaction (they do not seek out interaction on their own and so we could hypothesize would tend to have impoverished social support structures in the absence of structured social activity, social support network being one of the strongest correlates with overall mental/emotional health--even strong correlates with physical health).

Was looking at: http://www.early-retirement.org/forums/f28/myers-briggs-and-early-retirement-the-spinoff-50690-2.html which anecdotally supports this.

Poll here: http://www.early-retirement.org/forums/f27/personality-poll-17935.html

60% are INTJ/ISTJ.  Add in INTP and you get to 75%.

This seems like something useful to be aware of.  I would hypothesize that extroverts would do better being FI, as they build social networks wherever they go, and tend to be happier and more emotionally stable (possibly a confound with the social elements of the personality types).  This would suggest that there is a paradox to ER: the folks most likely to achieve it are also the folks most likely to be unhappy with it.

Not advocating any of this as absolutely truth, just an interesting line of thought."

PatHeist,buildapc,1390667470.0,"Everyone keeps counting the price efficiency of the cards in terms of FPS... It's like no one remembers that you have to look at the whole rig. With a 780 Ti and barebones everything else, that's an $1200 PC, which gives roughly 10% more performance than a $1000 PC, counting minimums. If we want to step that up to SLI capable computers, larger PSUs, and a chipset/CPU that won't bottleneck SLI performance (which is far more prone to bottlenecks) and any sort of quality, you're looking at a $2100 PC vs a $1700 PC, giving 10% more performance in FPS with the step up. Not counting monitors or peripherals. Honestly, those aren't that bad margins in price efficiency for the rig, even if they might look bad per card. But when you start overclocking, that's when the real beast shows - and if you're going bare minimum on spending, putting your motherboard on top of your table, running off a CX750, etc. You can probably end up with a better FPS/$ spent rig going with dual 780 Ti over whatever else. Yeah, it'd be pretty nuts running a motherboard on a table, decked with dual 780 Ti and rocking a cheapo monitor and a rubber dome you picked up for $2, but it'd get you a fuckload of FPS.

It honestly felt like a screenplay that suffered through several rewrites with some themes dropped, others added, some characters deemphasized and others added, and in the end became very muddled indeed.

I can see a great movie in it struggling to break free, but alas it was not ""great"" in my eyes, just a decent movie with some very good parts."

I was later told by friends that I sat on the couch, vomited all over myself, then became unresponsive. When they couldn't get me to respond, they called 911.

I have no doubt that if someone had wanted to rape me in that condition, I would have had no idea what was going on and would have stayed unresponsive throughout with no memory of the incident the next morning except perhaps some brief flashes.

Serendipitee,learnprogramming,1390667901.0,"Writing a GUI app is something entirely different than a whole X window manager. Very few experienced programmers even try to undertake the latter. To start you might want to just write a GUI app so you get an understanding of how window systems work overall and what is provided by the system to the window manager and by window manager to apps, and so forth... GTK is sufficiently low level, especially if you bypass Glib and use the raw C interface, to give you quite enough trouble, I assure you.

If you want something a little less difficult to start with (I get what you're doing, but I'm also self-taught and have some idea what kind of learning curve you're looking at and it's *not pretty*) I'd suggest trying Java w/ Swing (or whatever's in style these days), or a scripting language with GUI bindings. There's everything from Perl/GTK to python/QT and everything in between. Most scripting languages are quick to learn and easier to use so that you can focus on learning the GUI frameworks and other such instead of struggling with pointers and the like.

What I did, was start easy, work my way into complexity, then go back to easy. I learned TCL/TK, which is about the dumbest but easiest thing to use out there. After I'd learned the basic concepts, I moved to C and got a good foundation in that, but have almost never used it for anything non-academic. It's like learning Latin, it's interesting and helps you understanding modern languages on a deeper level, but is rarely used on its own. After getting comfortable enough with C I moved to Perl which was far faster/easier to write in, and Perl/Tk and even Java/Swing before I ended my GUI futzing and mved to web back-end coding where the money was at (also in perl/python/etc. which are all C based and thus extremely easy to pick up and move between with the strong background in C I have).

Does that make sense? Start easy to learn concepts, then work back through the nuts and bolts stuff once you have basic concepts down, then take that understanding to new heights of usefulness by using more modern tools and libraries (ala scripting languages - or Glib or whatnot if you need low level stuff). This worked for me, your results may vary, etc, etc.

That said, actual low level X programming is a bitch. There are full, large volumes dedicated to the topic. I used to do contract work for Xi Graphics, owned by one of the original programmers of X386 and purveyors of, what was at the time, the single proprietary driver system for X (Accelerated X). I learned then quite plainly that unless you're a math genius or just really, really insane you do *not* want to play with low level X stuff. I'm not sure on the window manager specifics, but anything that close to the X server itself can not be healthy for a beginner project. :P"

Monosentence,AskReddit,1390668034.0,"**I have two stories**

When I was a kid, like a few of the others in the thread, I somehow managed to get all sorts of first edition Pokemon holographic cards. Charizard, Venasaur, Zapdos, Jolteon, and a bunch of others.

I had a housefire some years back, and of course they were all stored in a box in my closet. 

Beyond that I've never really had much circumstantial luck. I never win contests.


Although...Last year on a game called Ragnarok Online me and a buddy went on an MVP hunt, which is basically a boss/high tier monster hunt. Their drops are usually expensive, and their card- which is an item you can slot into weapons and gear to give it an upgrade. Some MVP's are better than others, and we were hunting them one by one just us two. The thing about MVP cards are- their drop rate is 0.01-0.03 depending on the server you play.

Nothing good dropped, so we decided to invite two guildmates- One person that was a personal friend of mine, and the other a *brand new guildmate playing a low level bard character*. He'd just joined the game.

We went to hunt a monster called [Fallen Bishop Hibram](http://ratemyserver.net/index.php?mob_name=bishop&amp;page=mob_db&amp;f=1&amp;mob_search=Search), located in a high end dungeon. I was rocking my High Priest, buddy was on a High Wizard, other guy was on a Paladin, and then the lowly little bard was there just to tag along.

We found Hibram after searching the map and let loose on him. I'd tank his blows, keep everyone healed and buffed up. It was a fun fight, and with his 3.3million health pool, it took a little time with just us four. I remember explicitly someone said ""Drop your card pls Hibby"".

A half a minute later ""_____ Obtained Fallen Bishop Hibram card"".

The bard.

The goddamned bard got it.

After years of playing Ragnarok, my first MVP card drop goes to a newbie that *immediately* starts talking about how rich hes going to be after selling it.

Thing was, this card was *not* one you give to other people. It was very, very fucking rare, and a crazy strong footgear card for PVP. It basically made wizards and champions a monster made of damage, as it bypassed defenses of player characters. Giving it away, even for billions of zeny, was asinine. You just didn't do it. It was a card you held onto and slotted into the perfect gear for it, and then proceed to kill everyone with it.

Of course, the crooked guild leader of the guild I was in and helping latched onto the kid and made him a ""captain"", yadda. To get ahold of the card presumably.

It wasn't really fair to be denied a rare drop in a party I created, but eh. How it goes I guess.

I neared the end of my workday and I needed to kill some time. So I decided to pull the 3 bottles out of my trashcan and enter the codes. One of the codes won me tickets to an advanced screening of The Dark Knight Rises the night before it opened at 7:30pm.

The midnight screening I was intended to go to was the same one that some asshat decided to kill 12 people and injure 70. I attended the screening that was immediately before the midnight showing, in the same theatre he shot up. Several of my friends were injured, and a girl that I knew, but wasn't really friends with lost her life. Chances are, I would have been injured, or worse my wife could have been.

&gt;TL;DR - Won tickets to an advanced screening of TDKR avoiding going to the Aurora Movie Theatre shooting July 2012.

He figuratively dodged a literal bullet.

CBreaders are some of the most childish fans ever. I should know, I'm one of them. 

The problem just comes with the ""blackwashing"" or ""whitewashing"" of characters that don't need to be the opposite race. Now, if MBJ is the best actor for the role, then fine. He earned it. But if he is being chosen just to say, ""LOOK HOW PROGRESSIVE WE ARE!!!"" then I have issue with it. 

I mean, it is a pretty bad double standard as well. Imagine if they made Luke Cage a white, buff guy that was also a terrific actor. People would be bitching for years to come, even if he was the best choice they made. "

Lots of people have these experiences, and in fact with training you can even trigger them voluntarily yourself. You do have to be careful about the voices you are talking to, because that's an indication that there may be problems that you're not aware of.
Regardless, please look up meditation and transcendence and you'll learn more about this phenomenon.

The feelings of deep love, and the presence of God etc. are the common factors in all this.

Certain ingredients in some conditioners aren't water soluble (like some silicones), so those will be left behind to coat the hair and keep it looking nice until you next shampoo, even after you rinse. 

But you want to wash the entirety of the actual conditioner out. If you feel like your conditioner isn't leaving enough moisture to be noticable after you rinse it out fully, then try leaving it in for 5-10 minutes before rinsing or upgrading to a more intensive moisturizing conditioner or conditioning mask.

Malgraph offers a range of statistics as well as their recommendations (which I don't particularly trust anyway, given that it's got a history of suggesting BL to me).

None of these sites gave the choice of putting in a show name though.  Other possible sites that have recommendations on them include include:

* http://hummingbird.me/

* http://www.anime-planet.com/

* http://anidb.net/

* http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ (Not really recommendations, but a ""similar anime"" search.)

I don't really know how to measure healthiness. I do have PCOS, but I use birth control to manage the symptoms, so I don't really notice it most of the time. My diet is probably 80:20 clean:junk - I try to make sure I take in a good amount of proteins and fats, and that I eat fruits and vegetables and drink water. I weight train 3x a week, and practice yoga 2x a week. I'm trying to figure out which form of cardio to incorporate. I don't drink, smoke, or use drugs. My body fat is probably in the mid-upper 20s, and my BMI is good, so I've no concerns there.
  
Health and fitness *is* important to me. I don't want to get older and develop diseases or conditions that could have been prevented if I had taken better care of myself. I don't want to be a frail old lady because I couldn't be bothered to exercise in my youth. I don't want to put myself at risk for heart disease or joint problems because I never tried to keep a healthy weight. Having PCOS already puts me at risk for [various health problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome#Prognosis), so I'm trying to keep myself ahead of the game a little.
  
Having said that, I do expect that something will pop up sooner or later. But I'm hoping I can put it off for as long as possible."

At that point Hogan had been off TV for a couple months making a movie (or something).  His only presence during the initial invasion was being featured in vignettes about how awesome he was.  It was a build as if to say, ""hey, remember the Hulkster?!  He is pretty swell and would never turn his back on the fans!""

When they start talking about a ""third man"" and the Hulkster was no where to be found, it starts to smell a bit like a setup.  If I was watching the whole thing today for the first time I could at least see how it may have been a spoiler to a kid.  As a card carrying smark, however, when I saw Hogan coming down the aisle without the nWo third man announced I would immediately assume the Hulkster was about to do something nefarious.  

That being said, I still think that it was Schiavone who blew the call in his audible guffaw to Heenan's statement.  His tone screams, ""you weren't supposed to say that, Brain.""

yourdungeonmaster,rpg,1390669040.0,"The discovery of the second bag worked out really well.  They had already noticed some items missing, and a few added items they didn't recognize, but these were just so many mysteries at the time. 

One of the things they had placed into their bag was a medusa's head, wrapped in cloth. They had put it there, oh I don't know, somewhere between six to eight sessions previously when they had killed her. So they were in a crypt and came upon a room with a shallow pool and a fountain in the shape of a statue of an elf wielding a trident. There was a second statue of a human to the side of the pool, with its back to the party.  Stepping onto the bottom surface of the pool causes the trident to drop and deliver an electric shock, and this would eventually happen to one hapless delver a little later on, but I digress. 

The party's fighter circumnavigated the pool and investigated the second statue. This statue had a bag in its hand, one appearing very much like the party's own Bag of Holding.  You could feel the excitement at the table when they realized that they might get a *second* Bag of Holding.  Their DM was feeling generous with the goodies that day!

The fighter investigated the pool and saw a curious object in the water near the edge.  I required him to make a Fort save, which he generously failed for me, turning him to stone. ""Now you all see three statues!""  I declared gleefully.

From there they had to work out how to pick up and identify whatever was in the pool without looking at it.  I think it was during this process that the rogue got the shock of his life, but he survived.  Once they had the item in hand, eyes closed, they worked out by sense of feel what it was:  a medusa's head.  They figured that the second statue had reached into his bag, pulled out a head wrapped in cloth, opened it up, saw the head, and turned to stone.

It did not take them long to work out that it was not, in fact, a coincidence that a second Bag of Holding also had a medusa's head wrapped in cloth, like their own (although it was fun to watch them scramble to make sure they still had their own bag...they thought they had been pick-pocketed).  To confirm their theory, they looked into their own bag to discover that their medusa's head was gone.  Then they opened both bags at the same time and could see each other through the openings, push their arms all the way through, etc.  

The rogue asked for a knowledge check to see if he had ever heard anything like this, rolled exceptionally well, and so I allowed that he had heard once of a certain trio of bags.  They went on to relieve the fighter of his petrified condition, and a few sessions later came back with a balm to help out the original victim.  And that was the end of that.

Both bags were lost when the PCs set off a chain of events that effectively destroyed the world (their world of origin still exists, but has been ruined by a...never mind, it's a really long story, but their world has been sealed off by the gods to prevent the spread of chaos and ruin).  The campaign continues in the astral plane, same players, but none of the original characters from back then remain alive today.  

The third bag was never found."
MyBoobsAreGold,IAmA,1390669044.0,"Hi, I have been raped twice. When I was 12 my older cousin raped me while he was babysitting. From then on, I spent my teenage years desperately seeking any kind of affection from men. I slept with nearly 100 men and a few women before I was 20 years old. Then when I was 19, I was walking home from work at 11.30pm and was pulled into an alleyway and raped again, the rapist had a machete, and forced me into having anal and vaginal sex. He tore me open inside and I collapsed, hit my head on concrete and smashed my head open. I was left to bleed out, and would probably be dead now if someone hadn't found me. 
After I physically recovered, I found that I lost interest in sex totally, I went from one extreme to the other. The first rape at a young age set me off on a downward spiral of seeking sexual contact, whereas the later one seemed to turn off all my feelings. I still have a lot of issues from it, I am very cold to people and have extreme social anxiety and suffer from panic attacks. I still seem to gravitate towards bad, controlling relationships. I don't really know what I'm asking here, it just seemed like a good time to write down what had happened.

The ""problem"" with the breed is that Breed Standard (what champion dogs must look like) has morphed their jaws into their sculls for absolutely no reason other than looks. There is not one health benefit for their misshapen sculls. 

The more people who know, the better. Lots of people think bulldogs have always been this way. They have not. There are other options for this breed. Olde English Bulldogs are the same dog, without the disfigured scull. And, Olde English Bulldogs are still being bred today, which lots of people don't know about. If more people had this information, the dogs would not be suffering.

It's not about telling the OP they have a shitty dog. Other people who love Bulldogs, want bulldogs, and who are looking for breeders will inevitably read this thread, and if there is even one person who decides to get an Olde English Bulldog instead of the Bulldogs today, that is a success.

Also, you can not even come close to comparing Hip Dysplasia in Labs to the English Bulldogs' sculls. Good breeders of lab puppies test their dogs for Hip Dysplasia, and do not breed the dogs who have it. All labs do not have Hip Dysplasia. However, all, good and bad, breeders of English Bulldogs (especially champion dogs) purposefully breed English Bulldogs this way. They only breed the ones who have the perfect smashed scull, and for nothing other than looks."

Shame on her for not introducing you.  That sounds so rude in my opinion.  I would talk to her and say ""Hey, I would appreciate it if you introduced me to the friends you talk to when we're out and about.""

As for the photo thing, that still sounds kind of rude (that she's not including you) but it is a little more understandable IMO... I have various groups of friends from all different times and places of my life - elementary school, high school, freshman year of college, senior year of college, friends I used to volunteer with - and if I suddenly found myself around one of those groups, I would want a picture with all of us together to commemorate the experience.  You could tell whoever has the camera ""Hey! Now get a picture of me and [girlfriend's name]!"" so that there will be photos of the two of you at these events.

Honestly though, I think the best way to fix your situation is to just initiate other activities, both with your girlfriend and with other friends.  You don't have to go to every art event with your girlfriend or go with her every time she hangs out with her future roommate, and it doesn't sound like you are having a lot of fun there anyways.  Make some plans with some of your friends.  Friends aren't available?  Make plans with family.  Family isn't local or isn't fun to hang out with?  Go do something on your own that you enjoy.  Hanging out with your girlfriend because you like her company is fine, but you don't sound like you're having fun there, so you should go do something you do have fun doing, and then you and your girlfriend can hang together while doing something you both enjoy."

People in Africa and the Ukraine have a low suffering constant, like maybe 0.025, and here in the US middle class folks have a suffering constant of 1. The problem (P) of oppressive governments and rioting probably has a value of about 40,000, and your back pain is probably about 1000.

1. You're missing out on so much. ANet put a lot of effort into Tyria and the experience of exploration and seeing new places, new monsters, new everything is what made me love GW 2 in the first place. New players who level mostly on the train really stunt their GW 2 experience.

2. I realized what was happening too late but *the train teaches you nothing about your class*. Sure, you can try out your skills and weapons and combos on the train but in no way is it challenging. You are not pushed to learn about the subtleties of your class and how to excel when you are in difficult situations. You're lucky if you've got an easier class but if you've got one with a steep learning curve like elementalist, your skill level is really going to be quite low. I leveled my ele on the train and I couldn't even attunement dance at 80. I had to spend a lot of time with her to get her to the level of my first 3 characters.

On my server there a few train regulars that leveled 1 or more characters to 80. Classes like elementalist and engineer too. Once of them was complaining about being left behind in the train on her ele and I told her to use Lightning Flash up the mountain to spider. She said she didn't have it because she was using staff. Lightning Flash is a staple elementalist skill and at level ~70 she didn't even know what it was."

Serendipitee,learnprogramming,1390669805.0,"Java is a widely used language that can do most anything any other language can. Most modern languages have bindings to GUI libraries and lots of language specific libraries (perl's CPAN, ruby's gems, even shiny new node.js has npm with tons of packages) and *can* do most any task you desire, though obviously some have different strong points than others. That said, Java is well known in the industry to have an existing library/class/whatever for damn near *everything*, which can be both a pro and con. 

Many programmers liken writing Java code to being more like assembling a puzzle from existing pieces than writing ""real"" code, which is part of where the bad reputation comes from as to it not being a ""real"" language to be taken seriously. It's an unfortunate side effect of this puzzle-piece mentality that a disproportionate number of Java-only programmers seem to be less than good programmers in general, often start their jobs fresh out of school and only know how to piece together bits of existing Java from other sources - another source of Java hate.

The other reason I usually see given for Java's hate club is... a little hard to explain. Basically, the language and syntax are fairly forgiving and easy to use. Unfortunately this also ends up making it really, really easy to shoot yourself in the foot and cause yourself major headaches. Something can *look* right and the error you get can be from something far down the page, seem unrelated and make it very difficult to find the actual bug if you don't really know what you're doing (and even then, sometimes). Generally scripting languages are the most flexible, but also pinpoint errors quickly and fairly accurately, where Java has this way of just quietly failing when everything looks right, making you want to jump out a window after combing over the same stack trace 50 times and getting nowhere.

In a nutshell, you would do yourself a disservice to learn Java and _only_ Java, as is true with most languages but perhaps even more so with Java specifically. Take a few steps back and at least go through The C Programming Language book (it's short and sweet and contains  of knowledge) and get a handle on that, then move back to your ""sparkle"" language and use it with the deeper understanding of programming that learning C has given you. If you take a little extra time to flesh out your skills (however you go about doing so) and not get caught in Java's ""traps"" then there's no reason you can't be a very good Java programmer and make a very good living at it. You probably could do that anyway, but it's good practice to actually be good at what you practice.

GuyBelowMeDoesntLift,Seahawks,1390669912.0,"Hey, I'm sorry you feel that way. I tried to answer the question and that was my answer. It's just a general dislike. It really wasn't intended as a personal slight to any of you. I think that reflects the general sentiment among 49ers fans, some of it is bitterness that two quarterbacks of similar age and skill set (Wilson, Kaepernick) are treated completely differently by the media and fans even though they're both nice kids with the right intentions, and some of it is passive-agressive anger residual from Sunday.  
I'm not going to lie. You guys have a very good team. I'd be happy for your fans if you won. But that won't stop me from rooting against you, not only for the reasons above but that it would only encourage the serial downvoting between our fanbases that in my opinion is ruining this sub, /r/49ers, and /r/nfl.  
Just try to see this from our perspective. You guys were understandably annoyed when Kaepernick was hailed as the second coming of Christ after Green Bay in the playoffs last year. We felt the exact same way about the sentiment of Wilson, that he was unproven and overhyped.  
Now imagine if a high-profile 49er player, let's say, Aldon Smith, was caught cheating. How would you feel? Vindicated? Happy? But imagine if, at least to you, the media collectively ignored his cheating and he went on to lead the league in sacks. Wouldn't you feel annoyed? That's unfortunately exactly how we feel about Richard Sherman.  
Now let's say the 49ers had a fanbase not unlike the Seattle fanbase. In this hypothetical scenario, we consider ourselves to be the best fans in the league, and post record-breaking decibel levels even though fan measurements seem suspiciously lower. Now, I'm an A's fan. During game 1 of the ALDS, shortly after Yoenis Cespedes' home run, the decibel meter being pictured on the stadium board hit 110. After Marshawn Lynch's touchdown, a crowd 1.5 times its size generated 108 decibels. For a team playing one of the biggest games in its history and having the best fans in the league, should it not have hit a higher level? Now, for all we know Seattle has never pumped in a lick of crowd noise. But other teams have in the past, and it seems like a suspicious pattern to unfairly affect the visiting team. If the 49ers had had the exact same pattern, wouldn't you be at least questioning their fans' legitimacy?  
Lastly, the superiority complex thing is mostly a knock on one fan I know. But you probably know that one 49ers fan on facebook who spouts bullshit about the Quest for Six when he can't name anyone other than Kaepernick or Davis. Doesn't he make you dislike the 49ers more, just making you want them to get destroyed so this guy will shut his trap? That's more or less how I feel about this one fan, (If you're reading this, please don't take it personally) and it does make me more of an anti-Seahawk fan.  
I will do my best to keep conversation on this sub civil. I don't give my reasoning for why I dislike the Hawks unless it's a thread like this that invites such discussion. The last thing I want is more trolling by idiots who think they're hilarious.  
Again, I'll be happy for you if you guys win. That being said, go Broncos. "

paleal3s,LetsTalkMusic,1390670009.0,"I think that the argument that ""everything is a remix"" is true depending on perspective. As many people stated before, in western music there are 176 audible notes, and there is a finite limit to the possible combinations of those notes. I hate making blanket statements, but if you look at all bands right now, the chords they are playing have been played before and will be played again. It's possible that someone has come up with a new sequence of chords but was probably influenced in some way by the music they have listened to previously.

Yet that is not to say that music isn't original. Take DJ Shadow for example. From what I have read, his album ""Endtroducing..."" was the first album in history to be made entire of samples. The album didn't have a drop of original music in it, yet if you listen to the album you'd be hard pressed to say it wasn't an original and unique album in and of itself.

Take it a step further and you realize that this isn't just true with music. The argument applies to movies, books, paintings, and basically any art form you can think of. But take it even a step further, and it's true even for language. Language is made up by combining individual segments of language called phonemes. There are something like 150 different phonemes and obviously there is a finite combination of these, however large it may be. 

Everything is a remix.

FatHitman,news,1390670011.0,"I work as a CO in a federal prison. Most of the sexual assaults are inmate on inmate. The article does not take the fact that 9/10 of the assaults are not reported by the inmates. So then they take the staff assaulting inmates number and make it seem that it happens so much more. In reality it happens less but the incidents are always reported and the staff is always fired and also charged and ends up in prison themselves. So that is why it seems to happen more often.

This article is complete bs and it is directed to people who have never worked in a prison environment. Federal prison are some of the best places for inmate to live. They have tons of programs and have more rights then the staff. The executive staff take all inmate complaints very serious, investigations are always taking place on staff because inmates complain about everything under the sun. 

Also one important fact I would like to point out is there is a ton of inmates who will have sex which each other and it would be consensual, but there is no consensual sex in prison so it is consider assault if we find out about it.

The staff on inmate incidents are 80% female staff who ""fall in love with a inmate"". We see it very often when a female staff is not very attractive and almost always very overweight. Now they get inmates hitting on them all day which they don't get on the outside world. So then they eventually give into the inmate. First they start bringing in stuff for him like cigs, foods, candy, and weapons. Then they start having sex and we always catch them. I have personally walked in on a female staff member on her knees giving two inmates a bj. It is no joke in prison and we take it as a very serious issue.

It's a form of [Sayre's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre's_law):  ""In any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely proportional to the value of the issues at stake.""  Thus academic politics are so bitter, and modding communities are so toxic.

&gt;  If we take a look at other modding communities like Skyrim for instance

The TES modding community is famously a cesspool of feuds, petty behaviour, backstabbing, gossip, legal threats, and prima donna behaviour.  See, eg, [this post](http://www.iguanadons.net/Giskard-and-False-Accusations-372.html) and [this post](http://dlausactor6373.deviantart.com/journal/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Giskard-295324615).

There are always mod authors who view mods as art, and demand complete artistic control over how they are made, how they are distributed, how they are used, and by whom they are used, and who take immense offense at even a hint of their ideas being copied.  There are others who will slap an appropriate license on the mod, and push it out the door, and expect nothing more than the license terms to be adhered to.  I certainly wouldn't say the TES community is better than Minecraft overall, although perhaps it's a bit less drama-filled now than it was during the Oblivion era.

I do, however, think you're right to finger Sengir and, more generally, the FTB/Technic pack split.  FTB has always fallen heavily on the ""artistic"" side of the debate, even to the extent of refusing to include an updated fork of an open source mod (LogisticPipes), because the original author wasn't involved.  From a social/political point of view, Sengir and FTB won the argument; Technic has fallen in line, and all is well.  But from an ethical point of view, Sengir was uttterly wrong, and has never really been called to account; he's too important and connected in the modding scene.  Nobody wants to kick him and his mods out of the club, so...here we are."

hambeastly,TwoXChromosomes,1390670305.0,"Well hey! I'm in Ottawa, too, and I have that same issue. It sucks and it's cyclical, because you feel shitty for not having a social circle and that discourages you from putting yourself out there which makes you feel shitty, over and over.

And frankly, you do need to put yourself out there to an extent if you aren't bumping into people you get along with in your usual routine. The /r/Ottawa group is actually pretty great and I met a lot of wonderful people at meetups or just informal bar gatherings. It's not a big deal if you don't want to be a social butterfly. You can take it at your own pace.

Other ideas: volunteering? It's a lot of fun and you meet people. Also, the Comic Book Shoppe on Bank hosts lots of things that might really interest you--they have ladies' nights and on their Facebook page they're advertising [a women-created ""blogazine"" launch on the 2nd](https://www.facebook.com/events/1379944502267666/?source=1). OGSC also run [regular board game and video game nights](http://www.meetup.com/ottawa-geek-social-club/). I went to one of their board game nights and it was super low-key and friendly.

So there are some ideas for places to go. It's going to be intimidating, but it is so much better once you do it and see how totally-not-that-bad it is. In terms of actually interacting, hell, I'm still working on it, but I think the first step is attitude. Consider everyone a friend until proven otherwise. It's easy to have your guard up and feel like everyone is judging you, but they aren't. They probably want to get to know you. 

In conversation, people like talking about themselves and being asked questions that demonstrate you're listening and interested in more details or how they feel about something. E.g. ""I work for Health Canada."" ""Oh? What do you do? I've heard it's x, y, z."" It's okay to let other people lead the conversation and just contribute your own experiences or ask questions.

Good luck. You'll feel better when you step a little out of that comfort zone."

Next you probably want to disassemble the gun, might not be great for the inner barrel to be exposed to the boiling water and removing force, but this step is entirely optional. 

Then grab a pot of water, a channel wrench, and a rag. Boil the water and once it is nice and bubbly, dip the end of the gun up to where the outer barrel meets the flash hider for about 15 seconds. Remove from the boiling water, cover the flash hider in the rag, and twist with the channel wrench. The point of this isn't to entirely remove it, but to move it as much as possible before you have to use real force to get it to move anymore. 

Once you can't easily twist the flash hider anymore, dip it back in the water and repeat the previous two steps. It may take as little as one or two dips or a few more. 

Once you get the flash hider off, grab a wire brush and make sure you get all of the remnants of the glue off the threads."

[This page](http://www.malesurvivor.org/myths.html) sheds a little light on that issue (#3/#7), including how some rapists justify their actions because the person appeared to be aroused. I'd guess that it has something to do with the belief that erection/ejaculation = arousal in all circumstances, and not (as OP mentioned in previous posts) a fully biological/autonomic reaction. It's obviously easier to see a male orgasm than a female orgasm, as well, so perhaps more perpetrators of sexual violence see the erection/ejaculation and justify their actions based on that.

I caught her cheating on me.  She wanted to go to marriage counseling to try and save the marriage.  I agreed because we have 2 kids, and to be honest, I wanted the marriage.  

Believe it or not, the cheating was forgivable, but going to marriage counseling, while scheming with another therapist in order to secretly plan her exit from the marriage was a really bad blow.

Also, during this marriage counseling time, she'd purposely do things to make me upset.  She'd get angry at crazy things.  We went from a good sexual relationship to nothing within about 2 months.  I was not allowed to kiss her or even look at her.  I thought she was just going through a guilty phase, so I figured we'd work through it at counseling.  The truth was, part of her scheme was to anger me enough that I'd be the one to demand a divorce.  That's the second thing that's hard to forgive.

The third thing still gets to me.  It makes me realize that nobody can be trusted, not even if you think you know everything about them.  She ended up admitting to a 3-year affair from 10 years prior, right before we had kids.  I actually would have been able to get past this, but this admission was part of her scheme to get me to file for divorce.  As a result, she was not very thoughtful about the way she handled the admission.  For example, she ended up telling me that she had sex more with other guys during her 4 or so years of affairs than she did with me during our 18 years of marriage.  Hard to forgive.

When I put it all together in my head, it's hard to forgive that she basically stole 18 years of my life from me.  In a funny way, it's hard to forgive the lesson she taught me that evil dwells within each of us.  I think I would have preferred to have married someone trustworthy and just gone through life naive to what people are capable of.  It's really hard to forgive the duplicity that fooled me so badly - we got along very well, we said I love you every single day, we spent pretty much every nights together, talking or doing other things.  From the outside and to me, it was an excellent marriage.  We had some problems, but the foundation should have been solid.

The fact that she didn't think the marriage was good enough for her is just so impossible for me to understand.  I now know that she had some issues, but she hid them very well.  I will never be surprised by anyone's behavior in the future.  I now know what people are capable of, and I now know that you can never really know someone.

It may be something of a vicious cycle, though, since the leaders of a republican government are a product of the society from whence they came, and if that society is poorly educated and religious, they tend to perpetuate the cycle of putting education on the backburner and promoting their religious beliefs.

And as /u/Lowbacca1977 pointed out, it seems that this is really more about socioeconomic factors than graduation rates. What that says about the quality of education, well, it goes beyond what a little infographic can show."

JustinJamm,AskMenOver30,1390670624.0,"Thanks! Don't worry, you didn't sound sarcastic at all.

Regarding discontinuity: it depends whether it's a marriage or a pre-marriage (dating).

**In a marriage:** My spouse would have to leave me -- relationally. That could mean long-term (or short-but-repeated) cheating, physically disappearing for a long time, etc. By contrast, issues like physical abuse or massive drug use would result in financial and physical separation, but I would not initiate divorce unless necessary for legal reasons. (Rationale: I made the most important promise I'll ever make, and I'm sticking to it no matter what. But I'm going to keep myself safe and healthy while doing so.)

**Dating (considering marriage):** Basically, the traits *that enable all other traits to be addressed/grow* are the dealbreakers. Humility &amp; willingness to improve, evidence of personal intelligence, ability to develop self-respect (and other-respect), etc. But inability to take suggestions? Ongoing conflict avoidance? Basically anything that makes it *impossible to work on all the other issues* breaks the relationship.

Money recklessness could be okay, for example, if I saw consistent *improvement* in that area. Same with chaotic character: that can improve. Even conversational depth can be developed, especially if it's coming from the person's insecurity. It's all about trajectory.

But if a negative trait (like ANY you listed, actually) was chronic and unchanging despite repeated, patient guidance? No way. I'd drop the relationship quite willingly. I'd also watch for *temporary* change or shallow ""pretense"" of change, *especially if they know you're specifically looking for that*.

Basically, if the kinds of traits that allow personal-ability-to-grow are evident enough and observably sustained over time, then all other issues can be worked through.

As a single mom, I thought there was no way I could be home with my guys, but I found a way. My oldest son needed me, and no one else can be his mom.

If he's as active as you present, he IS getting enough to eat. If he was malnourished, he would be lethargic, unable to do much. He knows what he needs! Small snacks on a table is a perfect solution for a highly active toddler. People make the mistake of thinking that what's healthy for adults should be what's healthy for kids, but that's not at all true. Kids can use more fat and sugar than adults for energy, because they actually USE it. One cookie might be the exact size required for a tiny tummy.

If he was home with you, he wouldn't need to go to sleep at any particular time, as he could sleep when needed the next day. He could be as active as he needed, without disrupting a classroom. You could meet a lot of his needs, while not making him feel shamed for having different needs than other kids.

As others have mentioned, he may have sensory issues; that is absolutely worth checking out, it has made a BIG difference for people I know, to give their kids the opportunity to address those.

If the guy needs to hear it more than the girl, then he will say it, hoping she will say it in return, and the girl will sense this as an act of supplication.

When I have feelings for a girl, I could go my whole life without saying it. Why? Because I show it already with my actions, and the act of saying it is unnecessary. I already know she has feelings for me based on her actions, so I don't require to hear it from her. I like hearing it from her, because I take that as an act of her supplicating to me, which is hot, but I don't have a need to hear it.

tendorphin,creepy,1390671066.0,"If he was really a narcissist, though, and thought himself important, he would have known or assumed that he would be able to make it with just his dad and himself. Most often with NPD and any form of psychopathy, the people are also *very* highly intelligent. He wouldn't have jumped into this without knowing what the consequences might be. He'd know that he could live with his father, or that he could be put into care until he was 18, and this would also open up the door to more financial aid opportunities for college. 

I'm not sure understanding violence toward him is making himself a martyr, though. It is absolutely a possibility, but it can be interpreted differently, as well, depending on what we assume before hand. If we go the psychopathy route, it could be that he's just trying to really hit it home that he is feeling guilt for what he's done. If it's schizophrenia, it could be that the voices told him the cops would hurt him, and that he deserved it (voices often focus on everything being the victim's fault, and bad things happening being deserved). It is a definite possibility, though, that he wanted to be a martyr. I have a smaller theory that he was acting out some fantasy that he's had and that theory almost perfectly lines up with what you're saying. I'm not sure what the disorder would be, though, as it isn't neatly nestled in any strict diagnoses, but...he could have had a fantasy of killing his mother and sister (perhaps they made his father's life miserable, perhaps he just hated them for some other reason, perhaps he just had some sort of idol (real or fictitious) who committed a similar crime. In this case he'd have to follow a set plan that he made before hand, and in being so taken in, he'd be feeling so full of grandiose power. He would see himself, and offer himself as a martyr. He could have even seen himself as a martyr (or taking on the role of his idol) just by being arrested!

He said that he hates when people yell and are mean to each other, so perhaps his sister and mother had a bad relationship and he had some instability and could not take it anymore after a fight, so he shot his sister, and then the mother due to her being ""mean"" as well, or perhaps that he didn't want her to find what he did to the sister. He did go *back* to the sister, though. This could be simply because she was still alive, or it could be that she was the focus of the rage, so he maybe left her alive on purpose. It sounded like his mother was downstairs, and the sister fell down the stairs and was shot twice, so he'd have had to walk past/over her to get to the mother, and then come back. 

I have had psychological training, and am still receiving it, but neither of us know enough about the case to really say what it was. It is so fun (that sounds a bit heartless, but I'd be lying if I said otherwise) to try to analyze and figure it out. Even without psych training, your points and observations seem very insightful!"

Greg and mDiyo made escalating changes to try and force their version of the recipe onto people; at one point this included code (from Greg) that would crash the game if both mods were installed, although he claimed that the crash was actually due to some of mDiyo's code to try and disable part of Greg's mod that was reacting poorly to some of Greg's code that tried to stop it.  Nobody knows the truth now.

Some people argued that changing vanilla recipes is always wrong, so Greg must be wrong.  Other people pointed out that Railcraft has always changed vanilla recipes.  Some people argued that changing *another mods* recipes is always wrong, so mDiyo must be wrong.  Other people pointed out that Gregtech changes a Buildcraft recipe.

If I choose to install TCon and GT, it's not mDiyo's place to worry about the result.

I can't comment on how strangers perceived me, I was 6 years old, they probably viewed me as they'd view any other kid that age. It had a lot of peculiarities. When I went back to Switzerland to visit after moving to Canada, it was a challenge to visit even for half a day with my old class at the Waldorf school, while I had no trouble doing it for a couple weeks with the public school I went to in Nesslau. 

I'd have to ask my parents about relative wages, but it's been so long that the information is out of date. That said, public school teachers do tend to get paid more in Switzerland than other teachers, partially because when you have a school dedicated to a particular philosophy, they expect the teachers to want to teach there for its own sake, rather than the compensation.

I'll be coming back to Switzerland next month, and there are some open English teacher positions in a couple of Waldorf schools I might apply to. If I get to that point of discussing salary with them, I'll let you know how it compares to the averages per www.lohnrechner.ch."

Lyte_theelf,AskWomen,1390671639.0,"I used to feel like a complete health nut, too-- totally organic, vegetarian, non-gmo, etc etc. 

This would take a long time to type up and explain in detail, so I'll give a basic answer and I can link to other posts where I have gone into more detail.

I don't know what you eat, but I'll assume that you have grains and dairy in your diet. Even though I had a totally healthy diet according to the food pyramid and never ate fast food or anything, I started having serious digestion problems, random little rashes, fatigue, worsening depression (suffered from it for most of my life), and I started developing food allergies. 

After doing all kinds of research, I learned that I probably had Candida Overgrowth and Leaky Gut Syndrome. It was a blow, as I'd thought I was totally healthy-- but as it turns out, I was destroying myself with grains, beans, legumes, dairy and most of all: sugar. I didn't even think I ate that much sugar (And it was never the refined type, always raw cane sugar or stuff like that). 

That's when I found the Paleo diet. High protein, high fat, low carb, no sugar.

My asthma is gone. My depression has been cut in half (did you know food allergies can mask themselves as emotional disorders? Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and probably tons of others). My digestion is better than ever, I actually have energy to exercise and ( *knocks on wood* ) despite my office being full of sick people, I haven't caught a thing since I started this.

If you think you are healthy but your body is telling you you aren't... then you aren't healthy. Bottom line.

I'm still all organic, and I'm a pescetarian now. Since I got the grains and dairy and (most) sugar out of my diet and started eating real food, my body is responding like it wants to be here, which is exactly what it is supposed to do.

Well, one of the things I did was list everything I HATED about my ndad, beyond the obvious alcoholism and physical abuse.  Later in life I did the same with nmom (her's was more emotional abuse).  I then took this list and tried to honestly ask myself if I did these same things.  Unfortunately I did on some of them.  I would then pick a couple of the worst ones and try to concentrate on 'fixing' them.  

Unfortunately I wasn't always successful and have a couple of broken marriages because of it.  But I didn't give up and just kept working on them.  I'm still working on them to this day. 

One of my 'problems' was/is I didn't communicate well with others, specifically my spouse so I tried to fix that in my 2nd marriage. Unfortunately, when she decided to divorce me, she used my FLEAS against me.  Well that sure didn't help that particular FLEA any.  When I met my current SO I was determined never to mention my childhood to her, or anyone else, again.  Fortunately for me, unfortunately for her, she grew up in a similar environment to what I did so when she started to open up it gave me the courage to try this 'communications' thing again.  This time it's worked much better.  

This didn't happen overnight, I've been fighting these FLEAS for 30+ years (I'm 55) and I'm still fighting them today.  I went to a therapist after my 2nd divorce for about a year (probably should have gone longer) and that helped a lot.....that and a lot of stubbornness in making sure I didn't become either of my nparents.  I still never felt comfortable enough to try and have my own children but I think I've done ok with my nephews and my stepson.

TL;DR: Identify your FLEAS or potential FLEAS, pick the most serious ones and work on them first, get professional help if you can afford it/self help (books, etc) if you can't, practice patience young padawan as you can't fix 18 years of bad parenting in just a few years.  Be happy with yourself, then you can be happy with others as well.  I hope that helps."

CambodianDrywall,AskMen,1390671687.0,"I made it to 36 years old without any contact.  Had never even seen pictures.  All I knew were bits and pieces I had picked up via stories from my mom and other relatives.  Never had the desire to find him, or at least that is what I told myself.


I was working on other areas of my life when the idea of locating my father started gaining some traction.  My company employs a PI for employee/client background checks so I reached out to him for help.  In less than 24-hours I had an address and phone number.

Took me two more weeks to work up the courage to call.  Some woman answered the phone and I asked for my father by name.  He got on the line and I heard his voice for the first time ever.  Just a single word.  ""Hello.""

I identified myself by name.  After a lengthy and painfully (to me) awkward silence he said, ""I'm not ready for this""  and hung up the phone.  

From there I wrote a letter to him.  Nothing heavy.  Four paragraphs with basic biographical information and my intentions/hopes.  All that happened a little over 6 years ago.  There has been no other contact in either direction.

Did it help him?  I don't know.  Did it help me?  I can argue in the negative or affirmative at length, so we'll just go with a wishy-washy ""undecided."""

I'll start from the bottom. I've seen straight cisgender people, people who are not LGBT, being treated as Holy Cows, because they identify as asexual or aromantic. I've seen the same people joining in with stories of their supposed oppression, along premises like invisibility and isolation.

Now i'm not against social justice, and im all for asexuals/aromantics/*etc* mobilising themselves to reach out and educate and help more people who might not understand their condition.

I just think the LGBT narrative being railroaded into being the GSRM narrative sucks, that i could be a lesbian, gay, bi or transgender person, question such expressions of structural oppression, as laughable in comparison, that i find the idea offensive, and have my head bitten off by self-negating trollops who put their politics above their very gender/sexuality, who cry oppression on my part for arguing about which direction this is headed. 

[[^Pause: *^In ^AVENs ^defence.*](http://www.asexuality.org/en/topic/18220-do-you-feel-oppressed/)]

Fuck that shit. LGBT first. Social Justice second. Where that overlaps great, thanks for the help and solidarity people. Where that overrules, fuck off, check your fucking privilege as you'd say. Intersectionality is another of your trumpeted cornerstones, and right here, *you're* being kyriarchal shitlords to us queers, so you better back the fuck up.

So, you wanna cry oppression when queer people question the replacement of LGBT with GSRM, you better expect friction, or you better stop doing that. And you queers who call yourself SJA's, better realise its shit like this that makes you come across as the lunatic SJW's.

Moving up from the rant. 

Thats aimed at both the Asexuals and the Sexuals, the Cis and the Trans, who bang that GSRM drum over LGBT. Its not just aimed at Asexuals/etc. Also thats what i've seen from a number of warriors/evangelicals and you know what utter cunts they can be.

Moving onto *science* and definitions.

Sexual Orientation: [The wikipedia definition.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation#Definitions_and_distinguishing_from_sexual_identity_and_behavior)

&gt; Sexual orientation is traditionally defined as including [heterosexuality], [bisexuality], and [homosexuality], **while [asexuality] is considered the fourth category of sexual orientation by some researchers** and has been defined as the absence of a traditional sexual orientation. An asexual has little to no sexual attraction to males or females.[3][4][5][6] It may be considered a lack of a sexual orientation,[18] and there is significant debate over whether or not it is a sexual orientation.[4][5]

I put the links in [brackets] to show each sexuality had a wikipedia page, but only asexuality needed justifying for inclusion within the article with references. I note, the **bolded** to me deserves a [citation needed] for completions sake. The remaining citations refer to what it essentially is, ""no sexual attraction to males or females"", and finally, the remaining citations state the aforementioned **some researchers** sit on a very controversial position.

While attracting allies might be one SJ objective, in redefing LGBT into GSRM in discussions in queer spaces, i think it is a tactical folly. When scientific study into transgender/sexuality is pivotal in hitting home with high level government considerations and decision making, politicians decision processes are better sharpened into a finer point, more easily and quickly understood, and diluting the definition of these well known and well researched *LGBT's*, only serves to make the old folks in power fall back on their old internal dialogues that its not *Born This Way* its still just the histrionic immature facade they thought it was back in the 80's. This is not to mention addressing non-SJ aware non-LGBT people of all ages we're trying to win over as nations. Come on. K.I.S.S.

Call me old fashioned, call me suspicious, but i'm dead against the dilution, distortion and politicization of the LGBT community for this Social Justice crusade. Its getting in the way of the most basic interests in LGBT solidarity in my opinion, dont get me started on when one of these shrill little harpies attacks some LGBT newbie coming to terms with their sexuality/gender, and they get ripped apart with unreasonable aggression for not using the SJW approved word of the season. It makes my blood boil.

injoy,Reformed,1390672074.0,"I always thought I agreed with RBMW, but, I think you have a point.  There's a distance from Scripture here that is a little alarming, and when it's summarized into neat points like this, it's really obvious.  All the more so because the biblical emphasis is on wives being submissive, not husbands being commanding, and this kind of flips that on its head and implies (to my reading, anyway) that the difference between godly leadership and ungodly domineering tyranny is mostly one of degree (e.g. ""does not have to initiate every action, but feels the responsibility to provide a general pattern of initiative""; ""accepts the burden of the final say...but does not presume to use it in every instance"") that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  It's like, ""be a leader, but don't lead too much."" I understand what they are trying to accomplish, but I think you're right, they should have just stuck with the many, many things that the Bible says, especially including all the instructions about how people in general are supposed to treat each other with holiness and selflessness and righteousness and wisdom."

When you are single(I have feeling that you are), you're naturally inclined to be around women, even just for friendship. They're pleasant to look at and be around, generally. And a small part of your subconscience probably thinks that there's a chance that you'll end up having sex with them.

Be honest: how many of your female friends would you NOT sleep with if they asked you? Assuming that you are both single, obviously.

Another thing that's good about girls in general, is that they are easy to talk to. If you like discussing life in general, then I'd say that the average girl is a million times better than the average guy at listening and participating without things turning awkward and cheesy."

No one else gives a damn that your life isn't perfect. In fact, I'd venture a guess that no one else's life is perfect either. If you want to connect with other people (and truly, to only have your SO as emotional support is unhealthy. You NEED to expand your friend base), you need to be able to be vulnerable. That means admitting you're not perfect and your life isn't either. No one likes that friend that constantly acts like they're hot shit. 

Join meetup and find a group that interests you. Get out of the house and stop moping. I'd also wager that your partner is unsatisfied with the unhealthy level of emotional support you require from her. 

Seek counseling. Then identify a group of people you think you might enjoy, or with whom you have a few common interests, and go interact with them. You need to be a complete person outside of your relationship. Codependency is unattractive. "

Some people in the thread are saying just to ignore her gender but I don't think that's what you want to do. Treating a female engineer as a typical engineer is important when discussing ideas or working together, but you sound like you want to convey your support for women in the field, and there is nothing wrong with that.

Maybe post a video supporting women in technology. Talk about why you think more women should be in the field-- focus on the importance of their contributions rather than just supporting them for the sake of being diverse. For example, the primary attempts at developing voice recognition software did not work with female voices because there were only men on the design team. Talk about Grace Hopper -- the woman who created the first compiler and COBOL!! Promote organizations like NCWIT and SWE and just encourage girls to get involved and try something techy to get a feel for the field.

We've been dating 2.5 years, but I went off to school so it's a long distance thing. I often feel like I'm single because he's not there to spend time with me or have intimate moments. But I assure you I am way more confident in what direction I want to take in life because of being single and having a long distance relationship.

I'm more independent, I know who I am, because I had time and space to figure it all out. Also being young, in my opinion, is a time to flirt/ have random flings because it all feels more intense.

You're almost right, but maybe a little off. I'm not afraid of being alone in the near future - I fully expect it, and I don't really mind. I have plenty of things going on right now. I am a little afraid of being alone later in life, but I think I'd be able to cope.

What I'm most afraid of is being in an unhappy relationship. Any sort of marriage of convenience, or that which is held together with children and nothing else. Now, I lived in a very stable household, and my parents still have a good relationship, but every single time they argued, or one upset the other, it reminded me how much I wanted that to not become the norm in my life. And it is very much possible that it will be - I realised some time ago that I don't have nearly enough experience to prevent it on my end. To that end, my approach might change but my motive will not.

I recently purchased a Chemex and this weekend was my first try.  I am coming from the Aeropress system, which I love, but I have always wanted to try this method, and the beauty of the equipment finally pushed me into a purchase.  :)

A couple of things I observed - I'm sure this is old hat for most, but if you are thinking about trying it:

* It makes me two perfect cups of coffee with 40g of coffee beans and around 700g of water (I have the 6cup Chemex).
* I could get two cups from my french press, but I love that the Chemex can be put on the glass stove top to keep it warm (I use the same element I used for boiling the water as I'm sure most do).
* The bloom stage of the process is really interesting and the smell is amazing.
* Perfect for the weekend when you have a bit more time.  Day-to-day, I may stick with Aeropress because of the speed and only requiring one cup before I go to work.
* No sedement in the bottom of your cup.  I'm sure I could improve my techniques with the Aeropress to cut down on this, but I noticed the Chemex is super clear.

Thanks!

I also have mixed experiences with the public school systems in Switzerland and Canada, so I'd say that depending on how your kids are, it could be the right fit for them, or it might clash, and the same could be said for the public school system, or even another alternative school.

There aren't any English teacher positions open in Wetzikon right now, so that's pretty unlikely, and if they did, it'd be for the higher grades (I don't think they even have English in the curriculum in the primary years)."

greenlady1,ABraThatFits,1390672475.0,"Regarding shallow vs not shallow, I have very similar measurements to yours. I also was wearing a 38C from VS before I found this sub. I have a broad back and ribcage with a bit of squish to it. I also carry my weight very evenly. I initially thought my breasts were shallow because they generally fit the ""on paper"" definition of shallow. But the more I look and compare, I realize that I am more projected than I thought I was initially. I think on the spectrum, I'm slightly shallow/maybe average projection. I do need bras with wide wires, which generally tend to fit shallow breasts better. I've been pretty loyal to the Freya half cups in the last year. I could still use a tiny bit more bottom projection than they offer, but the fit is so close to perfect that it doesn't matter.

And I just bought a demi cup bra from evollove, wearing it for the first time today, but it has slightly more bottom projection than Freya, and seems to be a better overall fit for me. I've only had it on for a couple hours though, so I can't say for sure how it will behave.

I'm sorry this is so long! 

TL;DR I noticed recently through my own experience that having a broad back and ribcage can cause breasts that are not super shallow to act shallow and require bras for shallow breasts. 

Does that make sense? If I confused you, please ignore."

silverionmox,worldnews,1390672572.0,"&gt; The hyperbolic parallel between chopping someone's leg off and a small section of skin, which serves little purpose, is absurd.

No. It's a medical intervention for no good reason. Cut off a toe, a nipple, an ear, they'll be fine too. Nipples for boys serve even less function, and it prevents male breast cancer.

&gt;It certainly seems like a more torturous experience for a mature person, compared to an infant that can barely comprehend feeding time, let alone remember the past 20 seconds, especially when presented with an talking Elmo or shiny rattle straight afterwards.

So I can torture a baby if I keep Elmo ready?

&gt;I was... not so much for circumcision, but rather to just leave it as it as an option for informed parents under a certified doctors' guidance, except without it being forced on children by ill conceived tradition, religion, societal pressures - whatever.

Well, I agree... but I consider circumcision at birth to be informed by ill conceived tradition and societal pressures. Show me which diseases are significantly more common in Europe due to lack of circumcision.

&gt; they are part of our culture.

So was whipping slaves into submission.

&gt;Meanwhile circumcision is done with a similar thought process behind it, ""it will protect against the possibility of these problems"". It is done with the infants' best interests in mind, in much the same way as a preventative injection, only earlier in life.

Good intentions are not a sufficient justification for an action. If it was actually useful you might have a case, but I have yet to see significant positive effects that outweigh the irreversibility, loss of bodily integrity and risks of the procedure.

&gt;Ultimately I guess my reasoning for this stance however is my belief that in a parallel world, if everyone was circumcised, this would be a non-issue. People wouldn't care about not having been given the option, and not in the sense of a 1984 Orwellian world ""if you don't know about it, you wont miss it"" sense, but in a more mob-mentality kind of ""I need to be like everyone else, or I'll be criticized"" sense. This dichotomy (pun half intended, I will admit) of social pressures on the issue between this and that world perspective, in my head, just seems... unfair and non-nonsensical, as best as I can describe it.

That's just an assertion, and given that my parents' generation routinely got their tonsils cut - everyone did it, but didn't do it to their own children, disproves that ""nobody would question it"". They also got their cow pox, all of them. Now nobody does anymore, because it's no longer good for anything.

&gt;All-in-all however, to wind this up in a nice, great big why-did-I-waste-all-that-time bow, should I be put in the place where a decision on this need be made, why do we need to make the decision? Should it not be up to the physicians to determine what is best, without them being forced to worry about additional overheads of public pressures, laws and all that?

It's up to us to determine the boundaries within which they should do their jobs. They are well-placed to describe the medical consequences of to cut or not to cut (with the necessary caveat for their own cultural, personal biases and economical interests), but body integrity, degree of parental control etc. are definitely issues concerning the public at large.

And most of the new instructors they've hired have no idea how to teach although I don't doubt thier knowledge but they seem uninterested in teaching.  Also this has brought out a huge ugly side of many of the faculty, that they don't care about the students and only care about a paycheck. During the last staff Senate meeting most of the faculty there attacked the Dean and many of the higher ups at the University about going forward with a football team instead of giving them a raise, not realizing that having a football team would bring in alot of revenue and would result in more bigger raises down the line. "
Serendipitee,learnprogramming,1390672701.0,"As somebody trying to teach my husband to program from scratch I can help explain this, I think. Even if you're not using a strongly typed language or whatever there's some minimal knowledge that you really have to have to be an effective programmer. If you don't understand how file systems work (the hierarchy of files and directories, subdirectories, and permissions issues involved) then things become confusing fast - even the most basic functions like editing and then compiling and running your code, much less organizing larger projects, require a fair understanding of the file system on whatever OS you're using (and possibly any remote ones you may have to interact with).

Beyond that, knowing the basics of how the internet works and things like the HTTP protocol become necessary for non-trivial tasks. Learning javascript then requires a basic understanding of the DOM. 

In a nutshell, almost any non-trivial programming task is going to require interacting with the underlying OS, the internet, or another application (a web browser or window manager, for instance) - very few things of any usefulness run without interacting with other things that you'll need to also understand in order to properly work with them. A basis in computer science will give you a lot of the foundation you need for working with various technologies. 

For myself, simply having had learned DOS back in the early 90s and how to work on PC hardware gave me a huge leg up in learning linux, then knowing linux became infinitely helpful when I started programming. Building up from hardware to operating system to user interfaces to networking to programming gives one a solid foundation along the way. It takes a little time, but that time will be regained in how much easier it is to understand things down the line that you'd otherwise struggle with and have to go back and learn anyway."

In the second semester, while on ""res school"" (for external students to do lab work) I met a ridiculously attractive girl and was quite jealous of the guy she referred to as a boyfriend. We only really talked for the last day of those 4 that I was there though.

5-6 months later, at my next res school that girl popped up with a ""hey!"". Because it was odd to actually know anyone at these things. so we spent the next 4 days constantly talking(and it turns out she'd broken up with that guy months before hand) . She had another subject straight after, so the next 4 days we spent constantly text messaging each other.

When she finished, on the way home she had a stop at my city and knew she'd need to print an assessment piece off. So she came to mine, Because her place was about 2 hrs away. That was our first kiss.

A week later I went and visited her, which is where I double checked ""hey, would you consider us dating?""

this was 2 years and 8 months ago. I still remember it like it was yesterday though, because it was by far the best thing to happen to me. We still live 1.5 - 2 hrs from eachother. but that will change soon enough. Either way, we're going strong, and happier than ever."

sambuca66,AskReddit,1390673161.0,"/u/havestronaut had a wonderful comment about this on a previous thread:
&gt; As an extrovert, I think of most interactions like a game of catch. I toss a ball to you, you toss it back. Everyone throws differently, so it's almost always enjoyable to initiate a little back and forth with someone.
Not interacting with someone feels like being alone, holding a ball. Solo catch gets pretty shitty after a short time, and there's no real way to not feel like you're holding a ball. Just feels kind of awkward after a bit.
This is also why introverts are so foreign to us. We see someone standing there holding a perfectly good ball, and we're like, ""so... You gonna toss that over? Give it a dribble? Anything?"" They stare back like, ""what ball?""
Of course, inversely, this ends up just feeling like dodgeball for the poor introverts."

The only reason we have to fear automation is the fact that we're still thinking in a socially immature way that doesn't know how to handle such issues."

I was looking for a friend. A buddy. Someone to have sex with. Someone to spend time doing fun things, and ideally - someone I wanted to share my life and my house with. 

**It's very much an interview when you're on a first date, and if you don't think that's the case you're very much fooling yourself.**

What you (I'm assuming you're a guy, correct me if I'm wrong) don't understand is that when women are on a date, which may lead to sex, the first thing that almost any experienced woman does is look for danger. 

He failed. He failed hugely - not just because I thought something was ...off.... but because he asked me the same question three times expecting a different answer each time. 

At best, that was child-like behavior he thought was acceptable. At worst, he was trying to isolate me.

I wanted (and now have) someone who is an equal, and a partner, and a best friend, and who is emotionally mature enough to communicate well and pretty much has their shit together. 

He was not that, and it's possible he was worse than not that. So I left. 

It's not my duty or obligation to give someone multiple chances. He wasn't listening, and on top of that he was creepy.

I'm explaining this to you, at great length, so maybe you can understand. 

Even if you don't get it, or even if you're just trolling, maybe this will help some lurker.  

TL;DR - rape and/or murder were only two of my concerns; something was definitely ""off"" about that guy.

When we first were together (first year or two) we were like rabbits- we had sex almost every day, often multiple times a day.

Now we average about 1-2 times a week during the school year (we're both teachers), and 3-4 times a week during breaks and summer.  There's a direct correlation between less stress and more sex.

Yes.  The study that came up with the 4% rule showed that it did cover reasonable inflation.  It isn't limited to ""dividend paying equities"" -- a broad market index for the stock portion of your portfolio is sufficient.

That having been said, hyper inflation would be a problem - and the study clearly states this.  I don't think it will happen in the U.S. again -- it's a bad thing all around, and economists generally know how to prevent it from happening.

Now, there are plenty of ways to account for inflation - normal or hyper - in your planning.  Off the top of my head:

* I-Bonds.  You can buy $10k of them per year - for most on the FI track, this will cover a huge fraction of expenses in a year, at least during retirement.

* Equities, as mentioned.  Retiring at 40 will generally have a different portfolio than a retirement at 65.  This is the only asset class that generally outpaces inflation.

* Obviating purchasing power -- for example, owning your house keeps rent from inflating significantly (of course, there are other expenses associated with home ownership that can rise with inflation)."

Employers need a worker, and employees need a paycheck. The problem is employees need that paycheck much more than an employer needs that particular worker, so guess what, wages will remain low. There's no incentive to pay workers more if they will keep accepting 7.25. What will happen is they'll keep expanding their profit margins, and the rich get richer. Many corporations are already recording record profits. All that will do is give them a new record while nothing changes for the workers.

The only way to get employers to pay more is to metaphorically drag them kicking and screaming to do so. You NEED to MAKE them pay more, because it's NEVER gonna happen on its own. Trickle down economics is a failed idea that has basically reversed the trends of the 40s-70s economically. "
KeepSantaInSantana,AskWomen,1390673739.0,"My husband and I have been together since we were young.  For the first year of our relationship it was 0 penetration sex, but fooling around every time we saw each other and had the chance.  Once we started having sex, it was every time we had the chance, which wasn't super often unfortunately because I only liked to do it when we had an empty house because I didn't want anyone hearing us.  We both had roommates, so it was not as frequent as we wanted but we still fooled around quite a bit.




After we moved in together I'd say it was 3-5 times a week and stayed pretty steady.  After we changed our lifestyle to trying to actively be healthy in all aspects, I feel like I live in a porn.  7-14 times a week, some weeks we'll both be exhausted from work and social lives and everything else in between, but even then I don't think we've had sex less than 4-5 times a week since we made the switch.



It's steadily increased for us but I can't imagine having sex any more frequently than we already do.  If anyone is having issues in the bedroom, switching over to an all healthy lifestyle is something I highly recommend, and I'd be more than happy to point you in the right direction."

The main problem with US public transport is that it is not extensive enough to be convenient for our sprawled out cities. That, and the stigma that public transport is for unsafe, dirty, poor people.

for a given temperature there is a given amount of energy in the system, the kinetic and potential energies of all modes of a system balance (equipartition theorem). 

Since all atoms will have the same kinetic energy, they must have different velocities as KE= 0.5mv^2 and the masses are different

bonding requires proximity of atoms, which occurs through the random motion of atoms. that is the hydrogen is moving much faster than the oxygen. This means there is much more chance of bonding occurring with hydrogen, than for oxygen- oxygen bonding to occur. 

from equipartion 

since E = (3/2)nRT (equipartion) and KE=0.5mv^2 then:

v  = sqrt(3RT/M)  

so the ratio of velocities v_H/V_o = sqrt(M_o/M_H)= 4

hydrogen atoms move four times faster than oxygen at any temperature and therfore have 4 times the reaction probability

Rodalli,askscience,1390674536.0,"Actually, it sounds like Wikipedia is explaining why the neutrinos are *not* traveling faster than light. The neutrinos were emitted at core collapse, but the photons (visible light) aren't emitted until the shock wave of the collapse reaches the outer surface of the star. I don't know how the events leading up to a supernova affects travel of photons through the stellar body, but I do know that it can take photons emitted in our own sun's core tens of thousands of years to reach the surface and be emitted into space. This is due to the density of the stellar body - a photon can only get so far before it runs into another hydrogen nucleus and is knocked off in a random direction. Essentially, photons can get bounced around inside the star for thousands of years before they manage to make the climb to the star's surface and finally exit the chromosphere.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_core:
&gt;Neutrinos are also released by the fusion reactions in the core, but unlike photons they very rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately

So, it's not that neutrinos are travelling faster than light. They are simply able to exit the solar body much sooner than visible light photons."

Pathogen-David,buildapcsales,1390674967.0,"&gt;Can I turn off the red led/s?

Not directly. You can usually cut the wires going to the LEDs though. Sometimes there's a switch, but I don't see one on this fan.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Does the size of the fan make much of a difference?

A 200 mm fan spinning at 950 RPM will move more air than a 120 mm fan spinning at 950 RPM since there is more surface area on the blades to interact with the air.

Another way to think of it is if you have two fans 120 mm and 200 mm that both push the same volume of air per second, the 120 mm will be louder because it is spinning faster.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;So should i go the 200mm route instead?

Why are you convinced you need another fan? The HAF X already comes with four fans, which should be plenty for most builds. Adding unnecessary fans will just make it louder since case fans (usually) spin at maximum speed regardless of whether your computer needs them."

FlagVC,Planetside,1390675108.0,"&gt; Yes, it is a problem because not everyone has access to a large playgroup or enjoys squad play,

Those aren't a requirement to look at the map to see where the action is at, or where it's probably going to be soon. Being in a group helps but in no way is it required. Also I'd say half the point of this game is to reward coordinated play. 

Does that mean lone wolves may not always have all the options open to them? Yes, but that's their loss, due to their choice of playstyle. Notably, they chose to do it in a game that's made for larger groups.

So do forgive my lack of sympathy for the limitations lone wolves place on themselves.

Edit:
If lone wolfing is what people want, there are games more tailored to that kind of playstyle. For those who want the group play, however, there are very few options, with planetside 2 being one of the better ones."

Best tips for dating I got were essentially these: 

What do you really like to do? What would you want to learn to do? 
Go outside, take a community class, interact with people. 

The more you learn and do and experience, the more people you'll meet and the more neat shit you'll have as personal experience. 

A few examples 

* Like horses? Learn horseback riding.
(In the Eastern USA 90% of the folks around horses are women.)

* Like snorkeling? Learn to Scuba Dive, and then become a trainer. (About 1/2 the class will be female) 

* Enjoy firearms? Become a trainer, make some money on the side, 
(but understand it's still mostly men)

He was aware of her past sexually abusive relationships and still made snide comments and completely avoided any kind of physicality with her. Unless it was a blowjob, then it was ok. He even said that she was in pain so he went about finding new ways to get bjs. So he could get it up for a blowjob but not to have sex? I'm sorry, but that's a ridiculous excuse and he's trying to excuse his very shitty behavior. Abusers do that. They're also very likely to claim that they'll change and they never do. So if she gains 40 pounds he will never look at her the same? Because that's exactly what he showed her. What happens when she gets older?

CapOnFoam,relationships,1390675342.0,"&gt;  Your bf sounds like he's meticulously been ""clean"" about everything and at this stressful point of doubt in your relationship, he would not venture out of the house unless he had a seemingly good excuse and 'proof' for his whereabouts. Whether this proof is real would be a question of his faithfulness. If he's managed to back up all his past absences with bank records and things like that, then he's probably gotten good at pulling together stories. 

I just wanted to quote this again for emphasis. He really seems like he has thought this out thoroughly, knows exactly what records to show you, has covered his tracks, etc. 

Basically, instead of working with you on figuring out why you're getting these texts, who it is, etc - he has immediately skipped to proving that you're wrong, defending himself, showing you records of his innocense. Seems a bit... overdone."

IngwazK,TumblrInAction,1390675349.0,"To be fair, part of what sells games like far cry 3, is that they are power fantasies of sorts.  The idea is that you go with normal guy, he is forced to kill a few people, gurns out hes actually good at it, and tends to get stronger and more powerful (skills or weapons) as he kills more.  Its played up a bit more realistically in far cry 3.  You have limited health and have to use bandages or medicines to help heal yourself.  Also, a large part of the game is SPOILER ALERT  


about the issues with this power fantasy and what it brings people to do.  The two endings, you must either turn against the rakyat to save your friends, or kill your friends to join the rakyat fullly.  Either realize the madness of what youre doing or accept the madness and become a monster.  

In that sense, it is indeed a power fantasy.  It is not a ""lets go oppress and murder the indigenous people!!! Tralalalalala"" kind of thing.  Anyone who has played the game will know that everything except the rakyat will likely try to kill you and may be successful.  Combat is not the easiest of things unless you just throw explosives everywhere.  So, the poc characters are definitely not feeble or weak."

Geohump,atheism,1390675390.0,"&gt; I'll admit that this is the first exposure I've ever had to Zeno's Paradoxes..but after reading the article, I can't help but wonder - when does discussion of the matter descend (or IMO, ""ascend"") from the level of the philosophical to the ""practical""? Esoteric thought is fun, but what value does it have to people such as the OP, who are trying to find their way within their own society?

The example Zeno's paradox about the arrow shows us that a paradox may be nothing more than a silly arrangement of words that aren't really logical.  These kinds of paradoxes are not useful in the sense of dealing with practical every day life, just as the silly,""Can God make a rock so heavy he cannot lift it"" or ""When is red blue?"" paradoxes. 

Paradoxes are a useful analytical tool, and the discovery of a paradox can serve to indicate an inconsistency in a model.  Science uses models as away to determine if the specific understanding of some phenomena, mechanism,  or material is valid. (For example the Evolution model is absolutely valid, as is the Gravity Model. )

&gt;In addition, I must admit..I'm part of the 'just like Santa Claus' crowd. I still consider it a case of special pleading that the definition of ""life"" could be stated as something other than ""organic"" in the case of a god, but not in the case of other (most likely) fictional beings.

A: Its possible you don't read enough Science Fiction. :-)  What kind of creatures would live in a Meta-Verse? :-)  Over the last 50 years I've run into a lot of non-organic life form concepts. (and I don't mean ""silicon based"", I mean any kind of physical creature,) 

B:  i don't see any special pleading being done. Its possible that's because I don't imagine all kinds of life to be similar."

Additionally, lots of people means lots of opportunities for witnesses.

People working on deck such as on aircraft carriers have dye packs and strobes on their vests which trigger when they hit the water-- if either of these things is spotted in the wake (with or without a person attached), the whole ship goes in to Man Overboard (MOB) search.  Carriers don't usually travel alone, so that's multiple ships on looking for MOB. Lose (or throw) a strobe or dyepack overboard without reporting it immediately and your career will be lost at sea. 

However, not every sailor who's on the decks will have those vests-- it's mainly for high-risk air-ops people.  The Navy still loses sailors from time to time; someone goes over at night or without witnesses, the watch misses it for being human, or sometimes for being a negligent person, and sometimes they don't find him-- searching a moving ocean for a drifting object is hard in good weather, and the ocean isn't famous for good weather."

Scanicula,Denmark,1390675727.0,"&gt; Det er i hvert fald der min lave tillid til regeringen ligger. De lader i stor grad til at arbejde for sig selv og ikke for folket.

Det her. 

Derfra hvor jeg sidder, virker det ærlig talt mest som om, at politik i øjeblikket mest handler om, at der er nogle politikere, der skal have noget løn. Det mener jeg dybest set ikke er det politik skal handle om. Det burde være et arbejde, der førte samfundet fremad, på den bedst mulige måde. Indtil videre synes jeg kun, at jeg har oplevet noget, der mest af alt virkede som et forsøg på at afvikle (velfærds)samfundet. Jeg er så også kun 26, så jeg har kun oplevet to forskellige regeringer, i den periode, jeg har været opmærksom på (dansk) politik. 

Samtidig synes jeg i høj grad, at der, på de områder jeg har nogenlunde indsigt i -og kompetence til at bedømme, bliver truffet dårlige beslutninger, som derefter bliver dårligt udført. Så min lede ved ""Systemet"" gælder ikke kun landspolitikerne selv, men også i høj grad embedesapparatet. Lokalpolitikere har jeg af en eller anden grund meget mere tillid til; måske er det fordi de ikke nær så tit er i mediernes søgelys?

Lige i tilfældet med DONG er jeg bare generelt modstander af, at man sælger firmaer, der ejer eller står for infrastruktur, uanset om det så er telenet, postdistribution eller elnet. Det har i virkeligheden ikke så meget med G-S at gøre, selvom det så også er en rød klud, eller hvad man skal sige.

wwwwolf,worldbuilding,1390675743.0,"Most mages would agree that [necromancy](http://encyclopaedia.avarthrel.org/wiki/Necromancy), as such, isn't really *plausible* in Avarthrel. Magic is based on the manipulation of the Ethereal field. It could be argued that life sustains magic; Ether ""sticks"" to living beings, to some more than to some others. Yet, since mages can actually utilise the pervasive Ethereal field directly, it doesn't really make sense to tap to the latent Ether in living beings - it offers very questionable gains over the additional energy expended in the process. (That said, certain beings, such as vampires, utilise the concentration of latent Ether in people's blood, and ghouls utilise the Ether concentrated in dead tissue and bones.) People who have done serious (and luckily often highly controlled and regulated) experiments on necromancy have not actually managed to produce too impressive results - while other skilled mages can perform incredible feats, necromancers can usually barely manage parlour tricks.

This doesn't stop the rumours, however: Supposedly, some necromancers have produced the kind of fearsome results that tales tell of. And, of course, the misinformation from those tales, and the fact that some creatures actually do subsist on latent Ether, mean that a lot of people are *trying* on their own to produce those results - always failing and always being a menace to the societies as a whole.

Most countries, especially the elven ones, have completely banned necromancy; Varmhjelm and Fionkyyde, the major countries of magical research, only have treaties and strict restrictions, and the serious institutions of magic in Varmhjelm and Fionkyyde always encourage very controlled studies of necromancy and teach the folly to every aspiring student. The most famous necromantic research centre in Varmhjelm is the Life-Force Laboratory of the Anchorfall Academy, and it's also their best-kept secret: no one but researchers know where exactly the laboratory is located. The staff assures that the experiments are merely slightly gruesome in nature and all bodies come strictly from volunteers.

The Battlemages of Varmhjelm assist the law enforcement nationwide on crime of magical nature. Vast majority of the cases they handle seem to involve people who dabble in necromancy. However, the majority of the cases usually are young mages who have not actually achieved anything alarming yet - mostly, the only outcome is a bunch of terrified townspeople, freaked out over sinister magical rituals. Majority of these people only need education; only a few actually requre psychiatric care or imprisonment.

tendorphin,creepy,1390675856.0,"Great question. Several studies have been done on this. Many studies show activity within Wernicke's area, which is the area of the brain associated with comprehending speech. This makes sense as the words would have to be deciphered by something. *However*, recent studies have shown activity in Broca's area!!! This is the area associated with creating speech patterns before you say them. A few studies have also shown lessened activity within other areas of the frontal lobe, which is responsible for more executive function (think consciousness, plus much of the stuff that makes us ""human""). This means that the voices may actually be their own thoughts, but taken to an extreme, such as invasive thoughts (I'll explain those a bit more at the end), but as they're created they bypass the area of the brain that let's us know, ""yeah, I just had this thought, so you know this isn't from an outside source."" So, their brain still has this activity going on that it must interpret, and because it doesn't realize the source is itself, it attributes it to some disembodied voice! 

To directly answer your question: Some report that they can tell it is a thought, as it isn't a truly audible noise (try to think of hearing a voice in a dream...you hear it, but were someone to speak to you in real life it may sound differently and wake you), but others report that it is identical to someone speaking into their ear. Sometimes whispering, sometimes shouting, other times just chattering nonsense or non-vocal sounds. 

Invasive thoughts are those weird thoughts you sometimes get. Not everyone gets them, but when people do, sometimes they're dismissed but they can cause some worry. It is a thought you may get while driving, like, ""I wonder what would happen if I swerved into that oncoming car."" Or ""I bet it'd be cool to hit that tree."" This is believed to be evolutionarily beneficial as it does actually alert you to possible dangers and usually, though it was your own thought, seems to not come from ""ourselves"" as we normally wouldn't think of hitting a tree, but after thinking it, we are more cautious about driving. 

Does that answer your question? If you have any more let me know!"

Foliagus,ghibli,1390675927.0,"

You've now seen two of the most popular 4, the other two being **Howl's Moving Castle** and **Princess Mononoke**.

Both are amazing, Mononoke is a little more serious/adult, but both maintain that level of wonder and mystery that Spirited Away and Totoro command.

My personal favourite is **Whisper of the Heart**, though that's sort of a guilty pleasure thing, the music makes me smile. 

I'd avoid watching Ponyo for now, it's about as close to disney-esque as Ghibli gets, great film, but not nearly as great as the three I've now mentioned.

Others worth watching:
**Castle in the Sky**
**The Cat Returns**
**Grave of the Fireflies**

I also used powdered garlic and onion because I don't like crunchy onion texture, but you can obviously use the real thing if you want.  This makes a very flavorful stew!  (You would follow a regular slow cooker stew recipe for times, etc.)

3 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1 inch cubes

1/3 cup Italian salad dressing

2 cups water

2 teaspoons beef bouillon granules

1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained

1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef broth, undiluted

1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce

1 garlic clove, minced

1 bay leaf

1 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon dried oregano

1/2 teaspoon pepper

6 small potatoes, quartered

6 medium carrots, cut into 1 inch pieces

1 medium green bell pepper, cut into 1/2 inch pieces

1 medium onion, chopped
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons cold water

Directions

In a Dutch oven, brown meat in salad dressing over medium heat. Add the next 10 ingredients; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1-1/2 hours or until meat is tender. Add the potatoes, carrots, green pepper and onion. Cover and simmer for 45 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Combine flour and cold water until smooth; stir into stew. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Discard bay leaf before serving."

LordAnubis10,AskScienceFiction,1390676261.0,"**TL;DR: they didn't have many F-302s for some weird reason and never thought to call in the cavalry of fighter jets we know they have; Area 51 is just gonna sit there and do nothing, not even bothering to move the chair. They didn't have many BC-304 class ships either (only 3 are involved in the episode) and Atlantis was the only spaceworthy vessel that could possibly engage the hive in time**

I agree with your question, actually. 

&gt;Why didn't the humans place Anti aircraft weapons by area 51 to fight off darts from getting to close

&gt;and why were they outnumbered by the darts.

&gt;If its earth wouldn't they have a whole array of X302 to combat them.

I also wondered why the hell they only had around 20 F-302s at their disposal when all they had to do was call up the nearest military bases and say ""hey, we need air support at area 51"", I think it would be worth possibly breaking the Stargate program's secrecy. Earth's total fighter count, not counting the F-302s, would probably have been enough to take out the collective dart count of one hive ship, which is around a couple hundred. get a couple military bases worth of F-16s in on the action and we'll give that hive a run for it's money. 

Also another thing you brought up, why didn't area 51 have anti-aircraft weapons in the first place? you'd think they would've been using alien technology to create new weapons and tech in the first place, so why couldn't they just move some of those weapons outside? it'd take them like, 15 minutes, and they knew the hive was gonna target Area 51 anyway, so why not?

&gt;why didn't they have more ships in orbit to prevent the wraith from even getting into earths orbit

Earth only ever had 7 Tau'ri-made Starships, the first being the BC-303 class vessel *Prometheus*, which alone cost over 2 billion dollars. Each individual BC-304 vessel cost around that much as well. You can tell me that they would've had enough time to make several more BC-304 vessels, which is true, but then I'll tell you that making cool Asgard-based ships are expensive as fuck.

Not only did Earth only ever have 7 Tau'ri-made Starships at it's disposal, but at the time the super-hive was discovered, The *Prometheus* and the BC-304 *Korelev* had been destroyed, and only 2 BC-304s were even available, the other BC-304 wasn't even finished. The *Daedalus* was in the Pegasus galaxy where it discovered the hive, and it pretty much got shot to hell. After that they contacted Earth and sent the *Apollo* and the *Sun-Tzu* to intercept it, with the same result, and the *Odyssey* was off on some secret mission we never found out about. Atlantis was the only ship that could've defended Earth, as the *Daedalus* was still pretty beat up, having only gotten it's hyperdrive back. 

They sent Sheppard to Earth through the gate to use the Ancient chair and destroy the hive ship, but given that Atlantis's drones didn't have much of an effect either, I doubt he would've had the same result (possibly if he had several thousand drones like we saw in ""Vegas""), and even so, **they still didn't move the fucking chair out of the area they knew the wraith would target**, and they could've even sent a nuke through the gate and taken out the hive ship without all the stress. They weren't really being creative.

We could either ride it out and wait to see what was in store when we delivered, or we could do a the MaterniT21 test, or we could do amniocentesis. 

We chose amnio and within a day or two found out that our child has Down Syndrome. Since then, we have had nothing but positive support, found dedicated specialists who only want to make sure this pregnancy and our baby are  developing well and  make sure we are safe, not to mention the dozens of resources to help us prepare for our son.

There's a huge difference between being introverted and contemplating suicide because your outlet for codependency is no longer available. THAT is what is unhealthy. I identify as an introvert. However, I also recognize that as a partner in a healthy relationship, I can't put all my eggs in one basket. 

I don't mean to come across harsh or bitchy. I found his comment about fear of being seen as imperfect very striking and to me, that's the root of the problem. If you're constantly living in fear, you can't cultivate healthy emotional attachments. I suggested seeing a counselor, and then I feel he should practice making friends. It doesn't have to be a get-together at a crowded bar. It could be at a small table game of D&amp;D with other introverts.

GraharG,funny,1390676467.0,"good points, thanks. I agree that once there is strong overlap of atomic orbitals we are fully in the quantum regime, and any macro model is out the window. 

But if the inter-particle separation is greater than the quantum ""size"" of the atoms wave-functions, then there is still an classical regime. Perhaps the relative velocities still affect how often a possible bonding event occurs, but whether the actual bond forms or not is far more complex... 

also its probably not even correct for me to assume that the higher the velocity, the more collisions and therefore the more bond chances, because a higher velocity particle may be off resonance for the bond reaction and have a much decreased bonding chance.

So, in a long winded way, im saying you are right, my model probably has little bearing on the situation. thanks again"

TheIdesOfLight,blackladies,1390676575.0,"&gt; Like you've been holding your breath waiting for her to fuck up? ""indefensible ""? Like she can't be corrected? The term may be wrong, but if u were expecting a pitchforks/ burn-her-at-the-stake response, sorry to disappoint u. 

Here's an idea: You don't speak for me. Ever. It's awful presumptuous for you to assume you can, at that.

As for your assumptions? Maybe you're salty that I'm insinuating that Gabourey, while wildly talented and someone I'm hoping learns from this, can actually slip up and do wrong. Just maybe.

Nobody expected pitchforks. What I DID expect is what is happening right now: A discussion about transphobia and transmisogyny happening right here in this thread. Which makes me happy. Because being Black doesn't mean we can't do harm to other marginalized people. We need to be willing to hold each other accountable.

I think you need to drink some prune juice and let that shit go. Because instantly becoming *hyper* defensive over her/the title and the subject speaks volumes in your direction. Not mine.

Ease off the fangirl trigger. Sidibe is not a celestial being. No one is doing her any harm. We are discussing the fact that she has DONE harm. And, yes, her actions are indefensible-- this does not mean she cannot be corrected. So slip your muzzle back on, chill out and join the discussion. If you want to offer an opinion from the other side go for it. But you attacking me (or anybody else forcriticizing her for that matter) is unnecessary and doesn't fly.

You pick up more than 20% of your stack when your opponent folds, and your opponent may well call with worse, in particular weak aces which you dominate. You definitely crush his calling range, and he is mostly folding. In addition, AQ will mostly be A high on the flop, at which point you are unlikely to be getting it in good. Further, when you have a pair of aces on the flop it can be hard to get value from worse hands. 

I would only make a non all in 3-bet here with a monster like JJ+. or sometimes a complete bluff like 89 (the bluffs are villain specific)."

0x_,SubredditDrama,1390677100.0,"&gt; By whom, and where? Because I've never seen this, ever. 

/r/ainbow, i comment rarely, and when i do its often targeted on bullshit. I've had one encounter with a cis/het asexual guy, and two SJW who were big SRS posters. I dont go looking for this, and i dont save everything i come across. I remember the guy well, but hes doxy so im not gonna link his name.

&gt; What are these initialisms' narratives, and why are they mutually exclusive? 

I didnt say they were. LGBT is their respective history and body of research. GSRM seeks to sociologise the term to be commonly used, with the addition of Minorities which recruits oppression points over the more straightforward LGBT, and Romantic, clearly adding Romantic and Asexual to the canonized LGBTIQWTFBBQ, which i always hated anyway. They have entirely different characters, have a big gap between them in recognisability, and one is based in a long history and the other got made in the last few years. Sorry to shit on it, but they overlap a BIT(GQLAAQIEZBBQ), they are neither mutually exclusive nor equivalent. 

&gt; Who is this even aimed at?

... [Pause: In AVENs defence.] ... Thats aimed at both the Asexuals and the Sexuals, the Cis and the Trans, who bang that GSRM drum over LGBT.

It was right there its like you're selecting bits and not reading the whole. SJW's in a nutshell.

&gt; little to do with the notion of kyriarchy

It was a wee bit circlejerky, but it was talking about overlap not overruling the bigger fish in the oppression pond. It was valid.

&gt; With all due respect, do you really think that even a majority of people who identify as asexual are doing so as ""allies"" who have been sneakily and disingenuously ""attracted"" to ""the LGBT community""

Yes, i have seen it. On pressing the matter of doing literally *just* that, he bailed out on it and quit the thread. The SJW were doing so from an LGBT perspective but telling other LGBT they were wrong to put LGBT before any of the others recent newcomers they invited to the BBQ.

I have to restate cos you missed it, i addressed it earlier, this was not all about Asexuals, this was about SJW of any stripe putting the New Improved (Flavor of the Month) Buzzwords (we promise this is the last one this time!) before the LGBT.

&gt; by unscrupulous radical feminists? 

I didn't say radical feminists. I said the Factualwriley thing was flawed. TERFs dont get an easy ride on reddit either. Feminism has heavily influence the push for the QUILTBAG into the GSM into the GSRM into the OMGSHITLORD GSRM is the right inclusive of everyone anywhere ever hippy dippy bullshit.

&gt; It's funny because you posted a link to a thread in which asexuals said they felt they've experienced little if any actual oppression.

Its not funny at all. You're being wilfully ignorant. As i called it the ""rant"" broken up with a ""[Pause: In AVENs defence.]"" in which i sought to give some distance between the centre of asexual thought, and those playing internet SJWarriors. Those i attack with the central point i make about why diluting LGBT is tactically bad for LGBT activism.

&gt;&gt; implying that Born This Way isn't a histrionic immature facade with nostalgia for the 80s

&gt; only serves to make the old folks in power fall back on their old internal dialogues that its not Born This Way its still just the histrionic immature facade they thought it was back in the 80's.

Did you just wilfully misquote me, or *criticise* the powerful catchphrase, which illustrates quite succintly the predetermines nature of sexuality, as demonstrated with brain scan research (unlike asexuality, which may have a more hormonal/psychological determination in many cases?). I dont get why you'd think that was clever if so.

&gt; &gt; call me suspicious

&gt; Based off this comment I would indeed call you that, though I still feel like I don't really know who or what you're actually suspicious of.

That doesn't work at speed. For those not in cold climates, picture a cold (subfreezing) day where the road surfaces, combined with road salting, lead to slush on the roads. Driving in that leads to constant dirty slush thrown onto your windshield, which leads to windshield cleaning--which, while the cleaner will in fact melt ice, it will also freeze over when it's thin enough and the wipers stop wiping.

A quote from wiki on [power factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_factor) for an easy example of the significance of the presence of reactive power:

&gt;In an electric power system, a load with a low power factor draws more current than a load with a high power factor for the same amount of useful power transferred. The higher currents increase the energy lost in the distribution system, and require larger wires and other equipment. Because of the costs of larger equipment and wasted energy, electrical utilities will usually charge a higher cost to industrial or commercial customers where there is a low power factor."

Finally, don't stress out about the fact that you should be getting somewhere quicker-- speed doesn't matter if you're going in the wrong direction. But you have to get off the couch and start out in one direction, even if you later turn somewhere else. Just getting out there in the world is the big thing.

Well, I feel like everyone needs some kind of ""cooling down"" period from the last relationship, both the breaker and the breakee. Sometimes the breakee was done a long time ago, and has already gone through this period in their mind, so they're feeling fine about moving on. But I don't feel like anyone should rush into anything.

I think if a person is really interested in you, they could wait a few weeks or a month or whatever for you to get your act together and feel good about the ending of the last relationship.

&gt; men would be leaving their women for another woman. Their wifes would be left home, crying, carrying their baby in their arms with no income but for the baby. 

Starts with this 

&gt;It' funny...back in my days

You sound nostalgic. About men leaving women for another woman, and the wife being left at home.

&gt;These days, we try to avoid the kind of woman leaving the candystore, if the candy is not served in a variety of colours on a silverplate

A really terrible analogy that I do not understand. If you are saying we are trying to avoid women that will not be in a relationship unless everything is perfect, then that should be a good thing. Why would you want to be with someone who can't accept your flaws?

&gt;Our

First mistake. There are roughly [150 million men](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html) in America. I'm sure they appreciate you speaking for all of them

&gt;greatest fear is, that it will be us who are left, crying, carrying our baby in our arms, giving our income away to the mother.

It is a great fear that the person you loved and are committed to will leave you and your children. This fear shouldn't be that great if you know who you are marrying, definitely not worth it being ranked ""greatest fear"". Also, is it a bad thing that women are no longer the only ones to feel that way?

So let me translate your comment for you:

&gt;Back in my day, men were so superior to women that they could do whatever they want. If women didn't like it, well fuck them because they need someone to provide for them. Damn it was so great when people weren't equal and we could use that to our advantage. Now after all them damn liberals and feminazis, I actually have to treat someone like an equal. Now I actually have to be a good man, because women don't need me to eat. 

feel free to correct me

&gt;I need to leave HIMYM.

I am amazed you lasted 9 seasons. The men are in no way similar to the men of your ""good old days"", and the women are treated like equals. Lily is a bitch, but that has nothing to do with equality. 

&gt;I fear, the majority of people in here are females not reading what I am actually saying or below age 17

You mean you believe that in order to justify yourself. I am a male, and I am above the age of 17. I read everything you said sentence by sentence and told you how I read it. It is on you to clarify the above comment.

use_more_lube,AskReddit,1390677656.0,"My Dad cured me of that right quick. When I was 6 (in the 1970s) all the other little girls were talking about being cheerleaders and I thought it was cool too. 

When I asked Dad if I could be a cheerleader, he asked me this question

""Would you rather be on the sidelines cheering for some other kids, or would you rather be the one people are cheering for?"" 

Soccer in the fall, Softball in the spring, strength and self-confidence and a feeling of team. :D

There's nothing wrong with beauty, but sexualizing kids (and I feel that includes cheerleading) is gross. 

There's subtle ways to guide your kids toward things that induce mental growth and maturity, as opposed to objectifying them and reinforcing stereotypes. 

Think about how you praise your kids - ""You're so strong"" or ""You're so smart"" or ""I'm really proud about how you (whatever)"" 

Those work well for girls and boys. 

Much luck. "

wolfkin,Games,1390677676.0,"**Plants vs Zombies 2 on my Galaxy S3**

I'm getting tired. For a game that was praised in reviews for not pushing or requiring micro payments. I have to say they flat out just lied. The advertising is kept to a minimum sure but there are no optional levels. It's nothing near the sailing level to finish the original. Yesterday I broke down and used a video to finish a level. It felt shameful. There are no optional bonus difficulties as advertised in reviews.

Currently 24/24 Egypt (thanks to cheating)
16/24 Pirate
18/24 Old West

The game is artificially hard. It always feels like I need to use my coins to use touch powers. I run out of them quickly and grinding isn't easy.

Yet there are things I love about the game. The plant powers are FANTASTIC. The new plants are great, the way the planting works is an interesting but not bad change. I love being able to revisit levels. But I miss my mini games. I miss ways to earn coins in my garden. I make a little progress each day. But very little. I've taken to doing Egypt endless mode to grind. They have pinata party every few days which sounds like a cool fun way to earn coin but they're hard.. so hard you end up blowing your coin to earn the coin. I've done it 4-5 times and I think I'm done. The prizes aren't worth it.

PvZ was a joy every second of gameplay. I could get creative, i never felt frustrated even when I lost. But isn't that. If I'm having this much trouble as an experienced gamer how much more are the casual people who were pulled into PvZ and enjoyed it. They MUST be spending money. The game is a money grab with a franchise I love. At least it's not the Facebook game. That one can't even get FB gaming right. I dropped it after 5 days."

I have a disabled friend who walks with this kind of walker-thing. The first time people see us entering a pub, there's always some who are surprised. Because she's different, you don't see that every day. Then they gape at her while she chugs a beer almost as big as her head (she's very small). By the third beer, it's nothing special.

That's why I do think it's important for the media to be inclusive, because merely seeing different people out there, being normal, buying pantyhose and potatoes and whatever is the best way to make people accept others - be they disabled, or just a different race - as normal."

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1390677923.0,"&gt; She is your mother, her house, her rules.

The world isn't black and white like that. While you are right, parent's who have that attitude are typically overbearing and end up having strained relationships with their children later on in life. If OP has to basically become a prisoner in her own home, she's going to move out as soon as possible and get the fuck out. Kids who never learn about proper boundaries growing up tend to struggle with boundaries later on in life. If you are raised in a controlling and overbearing environment you're going to think that's normal. Your advice of just letting her passively accept whatever is handed to her is really shitty. At the end of the day if her mom won't budge then there is nothing you can do about that, but she can at least *try* to fix things. 

&gt; Wow terrible advice your getting so far.

It's not actually terrible advice. The advice she is getting could help save her relationship with her mom. Just because she's not a legal adult yet doesn't mean she doesn't deserve *some* semblance of respect. Like I said, if OP has to live in a prison for the next year she's going to just resent her mom. Their relationship will worsen. OP will feel like she can't talk to her mom in fear of getting in trouble. This isn't a case of OP actually doing anything wrong and justly getting punished for it. Her mom read something she wasn't suppose to and freaked the fuck out. It's funny too because *so many therapists recommend journals as a coping skill.* If OP needed to hash things out on paper for 5 minutes, isn't that better then stewing about it all day? 

&gt; You wrote about suicide in a journal, no shit she is concerned.

So... if I mention weed being legalized in Colorado than I smoke weed? Or I mention alcohol than I'm clearly drinking it? OP actually said: 

&gt; I have seen a few comments talking about the suicide entries and I don't think I was entirely clear. All of my entries about suicide were merely talking about how sad it was people could take their lives. I claimed in my own diary I could never do a thing and that I thought life was a gift, but that people counted suicide as an option. (Which I suppose it is.) I think mother skipped the entries and when she saw the word suicide and option, freaked out a bit.

So yeah, *not that big a fucking deal.* She's allowed to talk about suicide. It's not a swear word. Unless OP said she wanted to commit suicide (which she didn't, she said the opposite in fact) her mom had no basis to freak out like that. 

&gt; It is a GOOD thing that she got you a therapist.

With a mom like that? Yep, she's going need it. "

The feminism subreddit is mostly women with a few men. Its a safe place to discuss feminist ideas. I think that its wrong to ignore men have problems, and to judge a subreddit where they talk about the issues surrounding being a man in a constructive manner. Just because you acknowledge heightism exists, or think that equal custody should be granted in a court of law for a divorce where both parties are civil and not deemed at fault, doesn't mean you're a woman hating, entitled MRA.

Buscat,Games,1390677951.0,"**The Banner Saga**:

Alright I know the combat isn't perfect. The incentive to leave weak enemies alive at low health is weird. But it's not entirely awful, there's quite a bit of depth, if not necessarily width. 

The rest of the game is what makes it worth playing though. The art is amazing, the music is good (if a little scant, 750k budget and all). The world is immersive and the story is great. But it's the intangible sort of mood the game puts you in that I love. It harkens back to a time when games weren't ""fair"" by our current standards. You have to make decisions without being sure what the result will be. I'm kind of shocked how entitled a lot of people feel to being able to get perfect results, because that's just not how life works. And this is a game about life, even if it has giants and undead creatures. This is a game about the side of conflict that games rarely touch on. You're generally not feeling the ""glory"" of war in this game, you're feeling the desperation, dread, and loss. You're feeling the difficulty of making decisions when people's lives depend on you. The extent of your morals will be tested. You will probably screw people over to help your own people, and you will try to justify it. I can see why this bothers people, they're used to being able to have their cake and eat it too. I've seen some complaints about the save system, but honestly I think it's too generous. I did the whole thing without ever reloading and trying something again, and that's the best way to enjoy this game. It takes a mature player, I think. One who is tired of being pandered to and told how awesome they are for doing nothing at all. 

It's far from perfect, but it's a truly original experience. After 25 years of gaming I often find myself furrowing my brow and asking ""have the games changed, or have I? Is the reason I can't recapture the feelings I used to get just because that was novelty, and I've seen and done it all so many times that everything is just going to feel like it's been done before?"". The Banner Saga gave me a truly novel experience, and made me forget my cynicism for 12 hours or so."

zewm426,anarchyonline,1390678174.0,"First, you have to take into account that the smuggler's den daily missions are considered 'elite' which means it's meant to be done in a group and no solo.

As for soloing on your crat, here are a few essential nanos to use in combat.

**For fighting a single target**

* [Motivational Speech: Heroic Measures](https://aoitems.com/item/155807/)

* [Malaise of Motivation](https://aoitems.com/item/236506/)

* [Red Tape](https://aoitems.com/item/30090/)

* [Improved Red Tape](https://aoitems.com/item/267311/)

* [Normalised Red Tape](https://aoitems.com/item/267308/)

**When fighting multiple targets**

* [Contemplation](https://aoitems.com/item/155577/)

You'll want to keep any adds calmed/mezzed while you focus on a single target. Make sure you are running your AAO/AAD (Motivational Speeches) aura and that you keep as close to 100% uptime on your debuffs on the target as much as possible. At your level you should have at least 2 (3 if you are well twinked) stackable debuff nano programs. They are the 'Red Tape' nano line. Make sure you have Malaise of xxx and three Red Tapes (RT, iRT and NRT) on the target. 

As for pets, you could go all out and use your short term charm but it means you have to worry about it breaking and recharming/mezzing the add. I would stick to using the highest bot you can cast and the long charm. 

Make sure your agg-def bar is -100% (full def) and it's also important to trim (robotic trimmers which are purchasable in most devices shops) and buff your robotic pet, as well as buffing your charmed pet. You can use four buffs on both (Comp Physical, Cut Red Tape, Improved Cut Red Tape and your damage buff ([Weapon Enhancement](https://aoitems.com/item/27189/)) in addition to buffing your robotic pet with [Character Assassin](https://aoitems.com/item/155617/) and the [Galant Hero](https://aoitems.com/item/205303/) buff. For your charmed pets they also offer the [Galant Slave](https://aoitems.com/item/230388/) line of buffs.

If you're still having problems with this elite (which is reasonable considering it's meant for groups and the location has a lot of mobs grouped together in a small area), I would stick to doing just the solo daily mission until you have time to get a group for the elite.

Check out https://aoitems.com/nano/prof/bureaucrat/ for a list of all your nanos and nano cost / requirement for each one. Some of the nano programs I listed above are the higher level versions and if you can't cast them yet just go down the list for each type and use whatever is the highest you can use."

&gt;To enhance the machinability of brass, lead is often added in concentrations of around 2%. Since lead has a lower melting point than the other constituents of the brass, it tends to migrate towards the grain boundaries in the form of globules as it cools from casting. The pattern the globules form on the surface of the brass increases the available lead surface area which in turn affects the degree of leaching. In addition, cutting operations can smear the lead globules over the surface. These effects can lead to significant lead leaching from brasses of comparatively low lead content.[8]"

__________

&gt; &gt; I feel like asexuality is a legitimate orientation though...

Moving onto *science* and definitions.

Sexual Orientation: [The wikipedia definition.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation#Definitions_and_distinguishing_from_sexual_identity_and_behavior)

&gt; Sexual orientation is traditionally defined as including [heterosexuality], [bisexuality], and [homosexuality], **while [asexuality] is considered the fourth category of sexual orientation by some researchers** and has been defined as the absence of a traditional sexual orientation. An asexual has little to no sexual attraction to males or females.[3][4][5][6] It may be considered a lack of a sexual orientation,[18] and there is significant debate over whether or not it is a sexual orientation.[4][5]

I put the links in [brackets] to show each sexuality had a wikipedia page, but only asexuality needed justifying for inclusion within the article with references. I note, the **bolded** to me deserves a [citation needed] for completions sake. The remaining citations refer to what it essentially is, ""no sexual attraction to males or females"", and finally, the remaining citations state the aforementioned **some researchers** sit on a very controversial position.

So Young Link, when the Deku Tree dies and he first leaves the forest, is **10** years old. When he reappears as Adult Link, he's **17**. When he vanishes at the end of the game, he's **11**.

BUT, BEWARE. You will see that with a money card, the lower the amount gets on your card, the more you'll get the ""swipe again at this turnstile"" message. And if you swipe it right away, too fast, you might get money taken twice. You'd have to be very observant to catch that ""glitch"" (and it's a great way to make tourists double pay). I always know exactly how much I have on my card, and after getting ripped many times, I did my own study. I swiped in the reader to check that I indeed had at one ride left on it, swiped several time (telling me to swipe again), until it said that I had insufficient fare (that was the proof, and it happened many times). I talked to a lot of people about it, and most of them came back to me several months after and said that they indeed noticed it too. There is one solution that works. If you get the ""swipe again at this turnstile"" message, wait until the message disappear before you swipe again, slowly. You might get it again and again, but eventually, if you wait every time for it to disappear, it will let you in, without double charging you (it is very stressing when your subway is on the platform, but swiping faster won't let you in faster...).

Food for thoughts, since the bus readers never ask you to swipe again (seriously, did it ever happen to you?), how come the subway ones do? I'm not getting into crazy conspiracy mode, but why?..."

He works well for us as a 10 because he can become a third man in midfield to contest/ he unlike kagawa is capable of flat out running the ball up the pitch.  But because he's polarizing let's switch mata with kagawa in this and let's consider what we lose from switching Rooney rather than one of these creative players elsewhere on the pitch?

I had a second 6850 that recently got killed by a leaking liquid cooler, and I was able to run BF3 on Ultra at 1080p ~60FPs, run BF4 on High at sometimes above 90FPS (reduction to one of the AA settings because it murders GPUs), and Crysis 3 at High ~45 FPS. I was extremely happy, since it only cost me $65 for the second card to get that performance bump.

Everything else, like Batman, Sleeping Dogs, Far Cry 2, Deadpool, Medal of Honor (2010 *and* the Frostbite 2 engine'd Warfighter), LA Noire, Just Cause 2, Dishonored, Dead Space and Mass Effect trilogies, etc. run MAX at 60FPS or above on average (obviously not LA Noire, due to its 30FPS cap). Hell, even the original Crysis runs on MAX at ~40-45FPS, which is playable in single player for cranking all the eye candy.

The only things that need to come down a notch or two are bleeding edge FPSes, like Far Cry 3, Crysis 2/3 (DX11 mode), Battlefield 4, etc. Everything else runs extremely well on this. 

I cannot wait to upgrade so that I can run those ones with no compromises, but by and large, it's been a fantastic value of a card for the past 3 years. "

Brightt,AskReddit,1390678589.0,"I'll take your word on the differences between intact and cut penises, because I have no frame of reference, and neither has my SO, so I can't really comment on it.

You seem under the impression however that I am a proponent of circumcision, which I'm not. I stated in other posts that I would never have one of my children circumcised, because I agree with the sentiment that doing it to a person that is unable to give consent is morally questionable.

The problem I have with this entire debate is the fact that people on reddit seem to get up in arms when you say you're circumcised and don't mind. I honestly don't care, it's my penis, and I'm very happy with it (might have to do with size too, I dunno). I'm not saying they're not allowed to be upset, if it upsets them, sure, I can sort of understand it, I just can't relate to it. The thing that bothers me isn't the fact that they're upset, but the fact that I've had many debates where I was being shamed by multiple people for not joining in their self-indulged tantrums about their 'mutilation'.

There is a difference between having an opinion about something, and overreacting like a fucking retard. Unfortunately, the sentiments on reddit seem to lean more towards the latter than the former.

Also, to give you an idea, I'm from Europe, where the custom is very rare. I'm the only one of my friends that is circumcised, so I'm actually the weird one, and I still don't care.

If you want to get it banned, and want to spread awareness, sure, go ahead, but telling guys they should be riled up and angry about being circumcised when they're perfectly happy is not the way to go."

I do have the same qualms with Chiefs fans. I don't think they could become the loudest stadium in the league on a whim against a shitty team in a game where half the fans were gone by the end without help from speakers.  
I pay attention to the actual football. But in a thread where the topic is why people don't like the Seahawks, am I not allowed to cite certain fans as a reason why I don't like them?

Possibly helpful.

And the remark you stated about killing other animals is definitely big and debatable. The hallmark of a lot of people's arguments is whether the killing will induce pain and/or we even have the right to kill in excess with countless alternatives available. Shying away from the mass and inhumane slaughtering of other sentient animals like pigs, cows and chicken who are proven to feel pain as opposed to other animals who dwell in plant ecosystems is contentious.

We've cut upwards of 600k from the cap and have brought in some scrub who got cut from a second-tier Swedish side, a 33 year old Canadian Crouch and a high wage Brazilian striker that'll be here for one season, meanwhile we've released one of the best right backs in the league, sold off more than half of our wingers for our 4-4-2 (which is never going to change, Bruce has used it forever with us and the NT) and we're going to fix our problems with Rio fucking Ferdinand?

staffell,Games,1390679490.0,"**Broken Age Act 1** 

I think a lot of people are going to disagree with me on my review of this, but I am the hugest point and click adventure game and I feel like Double Fine really fucked up this game. A few reasons:

- For starters, if the second act is going to be the same length as the first, it's WAY WAY too short of a game.
- The artwork, while pretty, does not suit this style of game in my opinion. It needs to be more cartoony and less watercoloury. This is most certainly the point that a lot of people won't agree with me on, but I don't care. With this genre of game, the way it looks is the least important factor.
- I found the story extremely boring, and while I do like obscure and bizarre settings, the plot is so nonsensical that it's not even fun.
- The puzzles are so blindingly easy that I want to punch myself in the dick. Gone are the days of stockpiling tonnes of items and not having a clue what to do with them. There are also very little interactive pieces to each scene, so it's **very** obvious what to do, and even if it's not, you only have to try every item with everything and bam: solved within seconds.
- There is only ONE OPTION for interaction; CLICK. No option to Talk, Use, Pick Up, Push, Pull, Open etc etc. This kind of dumbing down is unacceptable and makes me LIVID.

Whether they are easy for the kicker or not doesn't matter, it's that is is improbable that anyone else on the team can do it, which makes that kicker's ability a commodity which will contribute anywhere from zero to 7+ points a game.

Rodalli,todayilearned,1390680066.0,"Modern-day Mormonism may be fine for you, given that a lot of the belief structures and teachings from the Protestant movement are eseentially the foundation for Mormonism, and a ton of modern Christian beliefs have crossed over and been absorbed as a part of Mormonism. You guys have some different beliefs and traditions, but a lot of it is mostly indistinguishable from other forms of Christianity. It's really not anything like Joseph Smith's original bullshit. Not that I put any more stock in Christianity, it's just that when your prophets are 2000 years old rather than 200, it makes their claims and reports of their activities a lot more difficult to disprove. Joseph Smith was walking around in the middle of the 1800's pulling ""artifacts"" out of his ass and claiming humdrum obituaries from Egyptian tombs were new books of the Christian bible. It only worked because the people he was bullshitting probably didn't even know where the fuck Egypt was.

I don't have any problem with modern-day Mormons. You've modernized your religion (for the most part), you do what you do, and you guys seems alright. But that doesn't change the fact that Joseph Smith was a con man and a liar. The man was not a prophet. This shit is not just ""dubious"". The man was clearly a loon. Some people at the time just didn't have the knowledge and resources to know he was lying to them.

There are no prophets! It is bullshit, and it has always been bullshit. If you ever hear someone utter the words ""prophet"" or ""message from God"", you can rest assured that it is bullshit and you should stop listening, post haste. That's not to say there is no god, or higher power - aliens, or whatever that would be - out in the universe. No one can really speak to that one way or another -- yet. However, I'm about 99.999% positive that no one on this planet is, or was, in communication with a higher power. Least of all, Joseph Smith. This is 2014 for shit's sake. We're not cave people.

It will also speed up porting, which right now I feel was a huge misstep on Apple's part in boosting Macs with their iPhone success.  Right now, the only ones taking big leaps for porting are the games.  It could be much better for the productivity apps if they were on both your Mac and iOS and talking together in real time.

The visual interfaces should be separate.  However, the underlying implementations should be almost no major difference.  I know it can be done as I have been watching the last 5 years of slow migration anyway."

Basically, just because it doesn't effect us as Cis women doesn't mean it's not a big deal. And when is the last time any of us nodded and smiled, say, to a white person demanding they be educated and handled with kid gloves for their bigotry?

We don't. Especially not in here. Hell, it's a running theme that we don't excuse people for racism because ""They didn't know any better""....correct?

I think it's incredibly hypocritical to come rough and hard to White people who ""don't know any better"" but we cannot do the same with ourselves. It's not pro-Black in my eyes to worm away from accountability and turn a blind eye to shit like this just because we share a skin tone and a culture. Because if anybody should know the effects of prejudice and marginalization? It should be us, shouldn't it? It shouldn't be a case where we watch someone pass the social buck to those who don't have the privilege of being straight or cis and then just say *""Well, they're one of us, so....""*

We expect White allies to take out their trash. Why need to take out *ours*, too. Because we as Black people suffer LGBTQIA violence the most out of all races.

Flatbar,personalfinance,1390680437.0,"That's not really how it works. It's pretty much impossible to say ""how many points your credit score will rise in the next 5 months""

There are many factors that go into it such as your total debt, income-to-debt ratio, duration of balances, payment history, how many cards you have, and more. It's not like there's someone watching you saying, ""oh, PattyOFurniture91 paid off his PC Richards card, let's reward him with some shiny new points!""

My advice is to do a quick google search (maybe google ""credit score explained"") and just read a lot about about what affects your score.

The best action you can take is to be vigilant about your minimum payments and spending habits from now till forever. Try to pay off every card every month, and don't let balances linger for months at a time. If you worry about missing payments, most cards allow you to set up automatic payments from your checking or savings account. This allows you to make the payment even if you totally forget about it. I didn't plan on this response being so long, so I'm done. Just do that google search."

hvisla,IAmA,1390680470.0,"I agree - the laws/definitions surely need to be revisited regarding female-on-male rape. Forcing someone to have sex with you is never okay, regardless of whether the rapist is penetrating the victim or not (though even still - the current definition means that putting an object into someone's anus is classified as rape, so anyone has the ability to do that). 

Definitely true that fewer males than females report rape - there are deterrents like the victim believing they'll be made fun of for ""being gay"" (in the case of M-on-M), being assumed as ""less than a man"" because they ""let someone"" do this to them, etc. Also, too many males believe that men literally can't be raped, which shows a true need for education on the subject (while it's not their fault they don't know).

Statistics of rape concerning male victims are estimated WAY more than ones concerning female victims because so few are reported in comparison (and I only say that both rely on estimation because obviously not every sexual assault is reported). I wouldn't be surprised at all if even more men were actually sexually assaulted (in total) than what current statistics show."

And now we have lvalue references as well. It's just *complicated*. Contrast with C which is relatively straightforward (but still people new to programming have problems grasping pointers), or Java (which doesn't have value types) or Python (where you usually don't care and it only occasionally bites you because you forgot that dicts are reference types, etc.).

Death_Urthrese,leagueoflegends,1390680616.0,"you cannot rotate a camera in these types of games.  it's built to only be visible from one camera angle.  just like diablo and other dungeon crawlers the camera is set from one angle so developers get away with single polygon images, no backfaces on tress and other props, and hidden texture seams.  i don't know why this is even something people want but i just want to inform people that the game was designed around this camera and switching the camera would break a lot of things.  it seems simple but to a game developer it's a nightmare.

EDIT:  ok, so since i did get comments on this i want to provide a picture for more perspective

http://i.imgur.com/txUxkhl.jpg

this is took me no more than a minute to find that the back of the gravestones had no interesting texture and are layed out in a way that is less interesting from that angle.  as well as all the brush grass is only visible from one side.  the grass has no backfacing and it's not as simple as just making a back to the grass. in games everything that's rendered has a cost.  to flip the camera they would need to either make it backfaced which would mean that every brush and anything else that needed that would cost twice as much or they would need to have a completely separate set of assets for a different view.  anything that makes league cost more risks them upsetting their player base.  how many fps or lag subreddits have we seen?  nobody wants performance issues so a camera flip might not be worth it in the long run.

it's a question as to whether or not this is something the community wants or if they'd rather have riot's time spent on something else.  i don't really care for a camera flip myself.  i'd rather have a new SR skin or more updated assets in SR.

It's just that neither of us thinks it's a big deal.

In all of our almost 5 years together, there has been 1 occasion where it has led to an argument (sort of). I'll even tell you the story. Some context is needed though.

We have a mutual friend (although she knows her through me), that has stated on numerous occasions that she would love to have sex with me, because she thinks I'm hot, and she likes me. She respects my SO however, and she doesn't make any moves. She and my SO get along just fine by the way, although that hasn't always been the case.

We live very close together and we often walk our dogs together. She had sent me a text before my SO came over asking if I wanted to go for a walk. My SO had read this text without me knowing, and during conversation, she said something snarky towards that friend of mine. I don't even know what the context was, I just know she said something snarky, which lead me to realize she had read my texts.

Now, I wasn't mad that she read my texts, she is free to do so whenever she wants. I was mad that she did so, collected information, and tried to use it against me, even though it was only meant as a joke.

She immediately apologized and she knew it was wrong for her to do so, so the argument lasted a whole 15 seconds.

So it is perfectly possible to have a healthy, long relationship with someone you love and respect, yet still read each others' text messages without scrutiny without this being a bad thing."

&gt; they hear about them only as consistent and universal, incredibly perfected tools to solve any kind of problem. The limitations and inconsistencies don't get to them or they just hamster them away.

Gambetta and Hertog talk about this as a serious possibility for why so many terrorists are engineers.

&gt; *Nature of the mindset*

&gt; What exactly about engineers' mindset or cognitive disposition could make them a good match for this ideological cocktail? We can conjecture that engineering as a degree might be relatively more attractive to individuals seeking cognitive ""closure"" and clear-cut answers as opposed to more open-ended sciences - a disposition which has been empirically linked to conservative political attitudes. Engineering is a subject in which individuals with a dislike for ambiguity might feel comfortable.

[Why are there so many Engineers
among Islamic Radicals?](http://orientemiedo.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/diego-gambetta-steffen-hertog-why-are-there-so-many-engineers-among-islamic-radicals.pdf)

Here is a study that supports this:

&gt; Political scientists and psychologists have noted that, on
average, conservatives show more structured and persistent
cognitive styles, whereas liberals are more responsive to
informational complexity, ambiguity and novelty. We tested the
hypothesis that these proﬁles relate to differences in general
neurocognitive functioning using event-related potentials, and
found that greater liberalism was associated with stronger
conﬂict-related anterior cingulate activity, suggesting greater
neurocognitive sensitivity to cues for altering a habitual
response pattern.

liberalism and conservatism](http://lcap.psych.ucla.edu/pdfs/amodio_natureneuroscience07.pdf)

I know that this may tick you off, but the very first thing that I see as a possible problem is although he's 22 and you're only 18, it seems like your maturity levels are flipped (you being a bit more mature than him). That being said, it wasn't very wise of you to try to kill yourself over this guy. Look, you're still a really young gal, younger than you'd like to believe, and you have your whole life ahead of you. This guy doesn't sound like he has given too much effort in trying to repair things if you know what I mean. 

You've given this guy everything, your love, your acceptance, your dedication, money, gifts, etc. and it doesn't sound like he has returned the favor unfortunately. My best advice to you is to take in the pain of losing him, because I know that as a stranger I can't understand the emotions you feel for him in an entirety. In addition, it's a lot easier for me or someone else to tell you to let go of someone because we aren't you and therefore don't understand it like you do. Nevertheless, I think that you deserve much better, and like I said, you're still young, you're still going to have a colorful life; but you need to keep going and stay strong. Don't let guys like him fool you into thinking that you're less than you are. Does that make sense?

I think that textbook jump shots and a straight bar path are general rules of thumb for regular assholes like me, deadlifting 315 and hitting like 60% of unguarded jumpers. The ""straight bar path"" thing makes me conscious of putting myself in a compromising position when I'm squatting or deadlifting, and it gives me an idea of how well I'm keeping a bench press under control, and shit like that.

If ever I get strong and am trying to set a heavy deadlift PR at a meet, I imagine I'll be know the movement, the weight, and my body well enough that I can make some tweaks. Until then, I'll keep trying to maintain a straight bar path because I'm a regular jackoff who can't squat 225 without good-morning-ing it halfway up unless I try really hard, and being conscious of keeping a straight bar path helps me not do that.

One of the sisters was looking at me weird, but my SO noticed and she said it's fine.

So no, it's not sneakily, but I can tell you I've read her text messages without her knowledge and vise versa without it being a problem. Usually because reading other people's texts is FUCKING BORING. If I find something noteworthy, I'll tell her about it and we'll talk, but I don't tell her every time I do it, because it's usually fucking stupid shit all the way anyway.

And she does the same. Well, the main thing is that I barely ever text anyone other than her, and the texts I do send to other people are just my friends telling me to come over or me asking if I can come over, so it's not like she's going to find much."

embersandenvelopes,pics,1390681036.0,"White balance corrects color.   in your photo, notice how your skin is very yellow/orange?  Realistically your skin color doesn't look like that at all, the effect comes from improper camera settings. (edited to add: I can tell you took this photo indoors) You can set white balance on a camera to auto, which is hit and miss, and you can also specifically use settings like fluorescent or incandescent, cloudy or sunny, and other situation specific settings, also hit and miss.  In certain lighting you'll look blue/green and in others you'll look red/yellow without correction.  
I honestly don't use Photoshop enough to guide you through it, but you'll find white balance correction or color correction in there somewhere and it can be fun to tweak the settings until you find one that looks more natural.  Generally by picking a contrasting color ( something blueish in your case) you can balance out the yellow.  Also edited to add: Ideally you want to perfect this IN camera as opposed to doing it in photoshop.  If you're interested in photography, work on knowing your camera settings and using a DSLR appropriately BEFORE you learn to edit your images.  Its putting the cart before the horse in a sense.  The better your images are before editing, the less work you have to do later.  All in all though, the effect/technique you learned is very neat!"

It hurt pretty bad and soon my whole family caught on. So every time I cry or say something hurts, I get told the same thing and my feelings don't matter.

She also used to hit me(not beat me up, but hit me) and put me under cold water if I misbehaved. That was not nice at all. I hated it.

She yells at me a lot. And mocks me a lot too. I hate the mockery.

She never asks me to do anything, she orders it. It's never ""hey would you please do the dishes?"" it's always ""[name] do the damn dishes"". It gets really tiring!"

Sadly there are lots of business owners like him because they saw a chance to make lots of money on the ecig bandwagon. This is another incident that would will fixed when FDA regulates. You can't just put whatever you want into a product, label it different, assure your customer that it's different than the label, then say something else when they call. THERE SHOULD BE NO CONFUSION. Could you imagine if OTC medication was like that? I know I'll catch some hate for saying this, but I believe it, and it's that the FDA regulations will actually make this safer. I'm not talking bans or state wide sales bans, I'm talking industry regulation. In the future, you won't see people making their own juice in their bathtub off some website. All juice will be made in a FDA approved lab with built in standard operating procedures, QC, and lab analysis of the juice BEFORE it is sold. Just like cosmetics, medications, and hell even cigarettes to an extent. 

edit: OP can you explain how the bottles are sealed? was there a cap heat shrink band around it, or was the whole bottle wrapped in tape or something? Also was the batch code the same on the bottles? I'm seeing #000185 on them all, which is weird because they are all different flavors...."

ronearc,AskWomen,1390681439.0,"I hope you don't mind me answering, but I just have to share. 

My wife and I met online in 2006, playing World of Warcraft. For the first year, we were just friends - actually, for the first few months, she thought I was a jerk. :)

But over the course of the next year, we became friends, and there was a chance that there might be 'something more' there, but we weren't sure. 

At any rate, fast forward to early 2008 and I was informed by my employer that I'd won the Founder's Award for 2007. That award included an all expenses paid trip for two to Hawaii. 

I had no idea who to take. I'd be staying at our CEOs guest house, and the rules were my guest had to be 21 or over, so I couldn't bring my daughter from my first marriage. 

On a whim (more like a hope and a prayer), I invited this cool Canadian, red-head in my WoW Raid Guild. 

I suggested that we meet before hand, in Dallas during her spring break from grad school, so we could have a chance to get to know one another before we had to spend a week on an island together. 

So we met up in Dallas, and...well, it was a pretty spectacular 35 hours. It would have been 36 hours but for Day Light Savings time, so we're convinced that the universe owes us an extra hour at some point. 

Needless to say, we went on that second date in Hawaii - after I warned her that I may never be able to top our second date. 

We were married in 2009, she immigrated to the US in 2011, and our first child is due in June. :)"

Celebreth,AskHistorians,1390681546.0,"Y'know, I have a *really* good book recommendation for you that actually covers about...oh, 90% of these. It's called [*In the Name of Rome*](http://www.amazon.com/In-Name-Rome-Empire-Phoenix/dp/0753817896/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390680443&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=adrian+goldsworthy), by Adrian Goldsworthy, and it focuses on the generals of the Roman Republic/Empire. It starts off with a brief discussion of the background of many of these men before beginning in the Punic Wars (Sorry - doesn't touch on the Samnites or the Etruscans). It starts off with Fabius Maximus and Marcellus (The Shield and Sword of Rome, respectively), followed by Scipio Africanus - and it gives background on all of them, as well as the circumstances that put them in office, too! But, on to your specific questions...

* After Scipio Africanus, the book details the war with Macedon, culminating with the conqueror of Macedon - Aemilius Paullus.

* After him, it details Scipio Aemilianus (Conqueror of Carthage and Numantia)

* Then Caius Marius (for your Marius and Sulla). This includes the campaign in Numidia (The Jugurthine War) and, if I remember (I'm away from my books at the moment :( ), the Social War.

* Then a guy you've never heard of - Sertorius, who was a *brilliant* general in the Marian Civil War. 

* Then Pompey Magnus (The brothers Gracchus weren't exactly generals - it skims over them for the most part, although they're mentioned). It covers exactly what you're looking for - All of Pompey's campaigns. The Third Servile War is discussed here as well, I believe, though a better description of that one is in Barry Strauss' [*The Spartacus War.*](http://www.amazon.com/Spartacus-War-Barry-Strauss-ebook/dp/B001UFP6FS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390681227&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+spartacus+war) 

---

After that, the book goes into detail on Caesar, Germanicus, Corbulo (Armenia), Titus and his siege of Jerusalem, Trajan, Julian, and Belisarius. The best part? It's not a hard read, and it's PACKED with awesome info. If you want more on the evolution of the Roman army, I will, as always, recommend Goldsworthy's [*The Complete Roman Army*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Roman-Army-Series/dp/0500288992/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390681432&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+complete+roman+army) and [*Roman Warfare*](http://www.amazon.com/Roman-Warfare-Smithsonian-History/dp/0060838523/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390681481&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=adrian+goldsworthy).

puaSenator,PurplePillDebate,1390681569.0,"I'm not trying to use the No True Scottsman fallacy, but it does get annoying quite a bit because people take one users example word for word and brand it across the whole sub. For instance, when SoftHarem was in an emotional debate he said you can't technically non-violently rape your wife. That's just one user and most people don't agree with him. But to this day, ""TRP says it's okay to rape your wife!""

Also, you are failing to see how people discuss in those parts. They are using exaggerations to make a point. Does she love you? Of course she does. Tons of women and men have wonderfully successful relationships without having to maintain frame all the time, as well as him showing weakness. The idea is though, that you have to constantly be on point. You have to constantly treat her like you're dating and show your best side. Because if you do start slipping, and you're no longer the man she wants you to be, and another man does come along that does fill her expectations, then yes, it makes sense she'll jump ship. I don't blame her. Why stick around in a shitty relationship?

You got to understand that that area is a self help forum usually filled with guys with poor father figures (so they haven't been taught how to embrace their masculine), so we focus on framing their outlook and acting with that frame. It's not meant to be something you completely focus on and obsess with (ironically much like TBP obsesses over TRP). Instead, it's more like, ""Okay frame it this way, go out and act on it."" Then they'll think, ""Oh hey, when I have this outlook, IT WORKS! I get tons more positive reaction from all aspects when I view the world this way. Now I get it. I don't have to always behave this way, but I have to understand WHY behaving this way is working and why people respect it.""

Like I've said before, it's SO MUCH EASIER to just say, ""Yeah, just ignore her when she talks to you and refuse to by her drinks. Just be a straight up dick."" This is easier than explaining ALL THE THEORY that goes behind that. There is tons of it, from showing her that you aren't her tool, that you have a spine, aren't afraid to stand up for yourself, and showing your confident doing whatever you please. But the idea is to just frame it like I first said, then have the ""eureka"" moment where you start understanding WHY that behavior worked. "

&gt;One scene that sums up why DS9, viewed as a whole, is the most ""human"" and relate-able Star Trek story.

&gt;I love the Cardassians, because they are kind of a ""Butterfly effect"" version of humans in the show. Looking at the Cardassians, you can see where, but for a few tiny course adjustments over human ""history"" (ST canon history), humans could have been them.

&gt;Klingons have the whole honor/warrior culture. Romulons are too foreign and not fully fleshed out. Vulcans are emotionless. Borg are robotic. Jem Hadar are one-dimensional.

&gt;But Cardassians... They're bureaucratic, petty, prideful, emotional, irrational, bad guys. But they're not pure evil. They have families and aspirations and human-like situations. They're more like humans having a shitty day. And that makes them fantastic, complex, characters.

Watching through DS9 again, I still completely agree with that.  Look at the mirroring between Dukat and Sisko.  They both have a single child, with whom they sometimes agree, sometimes disagree.  They both struggle with that dynamic.  They have a mutual respect for each other despite being enemies.  There are times when they do what they do to each other out of duty to their sometimes stupid governments, and there are times when they can become emotionally involved with their task, even to the point of detriment.  Dukat is the perfect anti-Sisko.  It's the only time, save for possibly Khan, where that occurs."

Ultimately, changing the way you view yourself is as simple (and complicated) as just choosing to feel differently. It took me years to actually do it, but once I did, I never went back. You have to choose, for yourself, to be happy. Stay out of relationships for a bit, as long as you continue to dislike yourself, your relationships aren't likely to get any better.

Yes.

&gt;Basically a company invests millions to launch their satellite but they are not sure whether it will crash with another one because there is not a central definitive database with all the information necessary to avoid any problem.

Correct-ish...  I think you're still not fully grasping how low the probability is.  There is a higher probability that the CEO will be struck by lightning multiple times, or that the guy in the mail room will win the lottery and buy out the company, than there is that their satellite will crash into another one.

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1390681949.0,"&gt; I think hypergamy is more constantly looking for an upgrade, even while in a committed relationship.

This is the perfect example of how a lot of BPers and RPers are using the term to suit their own specific needs.

I see RPers broaden the scope to include hormonal impulses and/or subconscious rationalizations. Makes it even more common than it already is. I see a lot of BPers refer to it as ""constantly looking for an upgrade"" *and succeeding*. Probably rarer than it already is.

However, it is generally used to by social scientists as well as colloquially used to refer to [""marrying up"" socioeconomically](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergamy).

It does happen, and it happens more often for women than men. There are plenty of excuses like, ""most people marry into their own socioeconomic class"", but if we're talking about tendencies, it's well accepted even by feminist social scientists that upwards marital social mobility occurs more frequently with women. 

I don't think it's a bad thing, per se, and many societies probably beneficial/inevitable when men generally experience favourable occupational social mobility."

Believe it or not, a lot of NFL players have the skill set to be drafted in the MLB. The MLB has a 50-something round draft. A *vast* majority of players drafted never sniff the majors. This is not to imply that Wilson isn't talented, but Bo Jackson was possibly the greatest athlete of all time. He was drafted in June and made the majors *that same year.* Most top prospects take three years to make the majors, and he took 50 games. Here's a summary of many notable NFL players who were drafted into baseball:  
Cedric Benson  
Tom Brady  
Eric Decker  
Dennis Dixon  
Toby Gerhart  
Colin Kaepernick  
Jake Locker  
Michael Vick  
Golden Tate  
Brandon Weeden  
future NFL player Jameis Winston

tendorphin,creepy,1390682047.0,"It is very sensationalized. The media tends to tie schizophrenia and DID together very tightly, sometimes using them interchangeably, but this is incorrect. With DID, there is usually NO interaction between personalities. The primary (or real) personality of the person is usually unaware of the other personality (or personalities) but the alternates are very aware of the primary. It often develops due to a huge trauma in one's life that one cannot bear to deal with, so the brain may create separate personalities to deal with it, thus protecting the primary. There are very many, and contradictory theories on this. Some doctors even refuse to believe it is real. DID has little, if anything, to do with the parts of the brain associated with auditory hallucinations, though. I do not know anywhere near as much about DID as I do about schizophrenia, so I can't speak too much on it, and don't want to risk saying anything false. I don't know which brain areas it is associated with (though I would bet prefrontal cortex is involved) and don't know too much about its acquisition or manifestation.

I really do still like her, her acting/body of work. But that doesn't change the fact that she goofed and the non-apology she gave was an ever bigger goof. I'm holding out with hope and faith that she does the right thing and evolves beyond this.

The problem here is that you assume I was sitting in the shadows like Gollum waiting for Gabby to drop the one ring because I dislike her on a personal level rather than simply calling her out. Because my issue is that, honestly, I didn't think she would ever say such things. She could do no wrong in my eyes. *This title is about how she shattered that illusion for so many of us* and even just in this community.  So instead of you asking me to apologize for using words you don't like, maybe you should consider that you completely misunderstood me and applied a shitload of bias to your issues with the discussion at hand.

Sure, we share a difference in opinion and I am okay with that. We're not all here to agree with each other no matter what.

Death_Urthrese,leagueoflegends,1390682115.0,"the thing with pro's is they show developers things with champions that they never expected.  a developer making a champ has an idea in their head how that champ is played and then when you give it to the world and 32 million people use it you start to see things happening with your creation that you never intended or didn't realize was a problem.  the only thing pro's do is bring to light issues that riot designers didn't expect.  

why nerf? right?  i mean their win rate is 50/50 so why does it matter?  
well this is one i want to answer because as a game dev it's annoying to see stuff like this.  right now if i said i'm going mid you might expect gragas or ziggs, jungle is elise or vi, adc probably jinx or lucian, support annie or thresh, and top mundo or shyvana.  my point is these are now the champions you expect to see played especially in the lcs.  the pro's have found unique advantages to these champions that no one else has and every pro knows it.  since they want to win they all use these champions.  riot nerfs them out to balance out the usually small advantage they have over other champions.  if they didn't you'd see only these champions every game and it would get pretty boring to watch the matches.

why not buff they other champions?  they do, yeah riot is slow at getting it out but it's also pretty fast given what they do in a year.  buffing a champion isn't easy.  the slightest wrong number change and before you know it you turned taric into a beast support that can't be killed.  yes some champions need buffs compared to the current champs but that doesn't mean other champions don't need nerfs.  it's balance, it's give and  take.  if everything was always buffed it would be the same thing but the numbers would gradually become larger on everything and become more difficult to read.

one of the things that riot does which is awesome is try and rework a champion to make the damage higher but harder to execute.  that way people see it as a nerf but to a skilled player they can really take advantage of those changes.  zed was nerfed but bjergsen used the shadows so well from his lcs match with him that people started playing him again realizing the juke potential of his moves now.  leblanc was reworked a long time ago and made her more difficult to play but gave her more burst.  now that people see she can burst a mundo all of a sudden people are picking her again.  she was thought of as useless and a waste of a champion.  then bjergsen plays her super well and all of a sudden people change their views.

TLDR: some champions need buffs, some need nerfs, some are over powered and we just don't know it.  pro's just bring to light problems riot didn't foresee."

There wasn't really a grand, unifying plot but it instead captured the emotions and feelings of its protagonists as they grew up, like a good coming of age story. There was always a lack of judgment on its part (due to the lack of an antagonist, I think), where every character's emotions, feelings, and decisions are earnest in nature and conflicts arise merely due to the differences in characters' attitudes and values (as opposed to any actual malice). 

If you add in a theme of nature preservation then for me it becomes clear why this movie is compared so often to a Miyazaki film. Though, I didn't find this to be as true for Summer Wars."

GiveMeABreak25,relationships,1390683111.0,"I feel for you more than I can say. And I certainly cannot tell you what to do. Each situation is unique and the consequences can be all over the place.

About the threat: If she is really a drunk (as it seems she is) that probably won't work. We like to think that losing your children (or, the threat of it) will straighten an addict out. The truth is, it's not enough for most. I don't know what her mindset is like. I suppose you have already tried talking to her as you mentioned. The situation I was in: the police had visited her before, but there was always another sober adult and they left it at that for some ungodly reason. It took a 3rd call AND her being completely passed out in the middle of the day with a toddler running around on his own. (she also threatened suicide, as she was prone to doing while drunk) It was the combo of being dead drunk with her child alone and before passing out, talking about killing herself that got him out of the house.

I only know what happened in this situation. And, for a little while she was sad and not having her son afforded her time to get treatment. But, eventually she beat that system too and figured out how to still drink, go to her daily meetings and still party all night (free babysitting, courtesy of me). 

As for when you make the call, again-I would make it when she is actively shit faced. Because, as you said, otherswsie they just visit and if the house is clean, the kids are clean and the mom is sober-they can't really do much. They need evidence. If they remove her kids, they try to place them with family first so you should get a call. If you know that the grandparents have substance abuse problems, that should be mentioned so they don't just go to another toxic home.

Again I am so sorry for your situation. I felt the same way when I made the call. That no one else seemed to care enough to make the call. But it's more than that, people don't want to take on the consequences either. 

Maybe it will wake her up to getting help? Does she have friends you could talk to and see if anyone else is willing to speak up? Just seems like you said, your folks have taken a lazy attitude about it (if they didn't, they would have to admit they provided the same bad environment for you guys to grow up in) but every kid needs someone advocating for them in that situation.

I don't know I have helped you decide anything. I guess my best advice is, make the call when she is currently drunk and neglecting them or else she will just keep getting the home visits that don't tell much.

I wish someone who knew more than me had better answers for you. PM me if you would like and best of luck and good vibes to you."

We don't have much use for it anymore. 

Most communications are digital and in print. Also, I take notes for college and I do just fine writing in print. I also have quite a few professors who will take hand written works but they have to be printed. So I think it's fair to say IMO that cursive is on it's deathbed. "
ballepung,AskMen,1390683140.0,"Oh, I'm by no means suggesting that every guy with a female friend went into the friendship hoping to get laid. This is more of a subconscious thing. Even if you're only after friendship, I think it's easy to be swayed by beauty/physical attraction, meaning that you're more likely to befriend a pretty girl than an average girl. You keep telling yourself that you don't view her like that and that nothing will ever happen, and you're probably right. But what if she one day wanted to have sex? Would you most definitely have said no, just to make sure your friendship isn't ruined?

My best friend once quizzed me on this. At first I felt a bit offended, saying that of course I don't look at my female friends like that. To that he responded that of course I don't plan or maybe even think about ever having sex with them. But that doesn't mean I would have said no to sex, given that we both were single. And I hate to admit that he's right. What does that really tell me about the relationship I have with my female friends? I mean, if I'm more than capable of having sex with them, then are they really *just friends*?

It's because of this I have very few close female friends now that I haven't been single for a long time. I don't do it purposely either. I simply forget to contact them. Because the moment I'm no longer ""hunting"", I don't see the need to actively seek them out. They'll only turn into physical distractions anyways, and I already have a decent set of close male friends, so there's not much to gain from it. I enjoy being around women in a non-sexual way of course, but I simply don't bother to use energy on it. If it's at school or work, then it can't be helped. But meeting up consistently beyond that? I really don't see why I should.

Obviously it's a different story when we're talking about childhood friends or girls that you can't find even a single attractive point with."

Hosting isn't as daunting as it seems and can even be profitable after a point.

Most important: location. It can be at your house, at your school, at a hotel, library, wherever. Just a long as it can fit some people for a long time. 

Gauge how many people are interested and choose your location based on that and don't for a second think that you can't have a 60 man tourney in a small home.  Make sure to assemble your friends as tourney organizers and overseers. It's important that there be multiple people who know what's going on so they can help people with questions and rounding up players for their matches. It also helps keep creeps from doing inappropriate shit. Don't forget that these are strangers. Things tend to go""missing"" without proper supervision. It would also be wise to charge a small door fee to cover losses and damages.

Also, this will probably take a long time so make sure you can stay at this location for a few hours.

Don't be afraid to ask people to contribute equipment. this is actually a common practice.  you'll need a few TVs, consoles, game discs, sd cards and always byoc(eliminates a common john).

Come up with the rules(most people just use general tourney rules) and make sure they're clearly visible to everyone. Also come up with venue rules. General behavioral guidelines so people don't end up doing something inappropriate or trashing the place.

If you have a lot of people then do pools and brackets. If it's small (like 10-20) then pull names out of a hat to assign bracket seeds. 

Charge an entry fee. Like $5 to $10 is what I usually see. Some of this goes into the pot that the winner takes home and you can use the rest to cover venue and equipment costs plus damages or just give it all to the winner or top 3.

Lastly, don't be surprised or disappointed if there's a small turnout. This is pretty common when there isn't already a large community but this is also the first step to creating and growing that community. Make friends, play everyone and they'll make sure there's more people at the next smash fest.

Ps: Road trips with friends are a blast. I highly recommend you venture out to the tournaments that aren't quite so local. This also draws more people to your next tournament.

Bingo. The thing that's holding you back is the fear of losing friendship(s). But if there was a way to not lose the friendships *and* have sex with these girls, then my guess is that most of them would have sufficed.

Which brings us to a more important point: are you really *just friends* then? In my opinion, if there's physical attraction, then it's no longer just a friendship.

I'm not saying there is anything wrong with that. It's just how many of us guys work. I personally think it's biological, but I wont go there now.

Your battery needs to be able to handle the amperage you're going to draw with your coils.  Lower resistance coils draw more amps.

The power needs to be used to heat your coils.  The less metal you have in your coils the easier is is to heat them.  Too much and it's going to take a while to heat up.

Doubling your number of coils will double the mass of metal you need to heat up while cutting your resistance in half.  Comparing a 0.8 ohm single coil build to your 0.8 ohm quad coil (using the same wire)... You're drawing the same power, but trying to heat four coils, and each coil is four times the size of a single coil.

I hope it's helpful. http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1n3m1t/eli5_why_do_people_who_are_abused_as_a_child/

""As someone who has gone through extensive therapy for just this reason and have done quite a bit of digging into my motives with professionals, I have found that there are a few reasons for this (some of them mentioned already, some not):
1.) Control. If I say no, he could take it anyway and it would further degrade me and hurt me. If I instigate or go with it, I'm taking away his power to rape me.
2.) Self worth. This is usually a result of conditioning. If I say no, I'm taking away his right to my body. I do not have any right to autonomy. If I don't give people sex, they will have no reason to want me. That is my purpose. I would be mean if I denied him that right, so I have to do it so he doesn't hate me.
3.) Sex = love. This could be because I was also raised in a physically/emotionally abusive home as well, but I think this is also a common one. The people I cared about, who were supposed to show me love and affection did this to me. It must mean that they care. As a child, I needed to believe that my family cared about me, so this is what I taught myself to avoid rejection and lonliness. Now, if someone wants to use my body, it means they want me. That's all I ever got, so that's enough for me to feel good. It's just a way to fill that hole (an attempt to satisfy non-sexual needs with sex).
4.) If I keep things about sex and be promiscuous, it makes sex meaningless. If sex doesn't mean a lot to me, that means that when it was forced on me it wasn't meaningful. You can't hurt me if what you stole is meaningless to me. It doesn't matter that I got sex instead of love and affection because that is all I need. I'm not lonely and I didn't want to be loved anyway, so fuck you.
Those are just my processes that I have heard described by other survivors. Again, I'm not a professional. I've just done a lot of reflection with professionals."""

As others have said, a tattoo isn't going to keep you from drinking if you want to drink. And it isn't going to do a lot to help you stay sober if you want to be sober. It's there, and once it heals, you really aren't very conscious of it on a daily basis. 

I love good tattoos, and think they are beautiful when well-done and well-chosen. They are art, and do not have power to change your life. Get a tattoo because you want to get one, not because you think it will have some supernatural power.

It sounds like you are unsure about quitting or moderating your drinking. You might try AA meetings, I found the support of other sober alcoholics very helpful. [This link lists AA meetings near you.](http://www.aa.org/lang/en/subpage.cfm?page=28) I recommend giving it a try."

keakealani,singing,1390684206.0,"So, to add some additional info: 

Attire depends on regional variations, too! /u/Masklin brings up a good point that in countries outside of the US, different styles may be appropriate. Even within the US, there is some variation about appropriate styles (places like /r/malefashionadvice and /r/femalefashionadvice are good places to start if you're unsure). In general, the further west (in the US), the more casual you can be. East coast auditions should almost always be suit&amp;tie for men and semi-formal dress (knee or full length) for women. In the midwest, a suit or similar is preferred, but some people may dress slightly more casually. In the west coast (and Hawaii, where I'm from), even more casual dress (such as a long-sleeve button down shirt with no tie for men, or a semi-casual cocktail dress for women) would be perfectly appropriate. 

If you are at all confused about what styles are considered audition attire, do at least one of the following: a) email/call to ask someone at the music department of your prospective institution (area head or (under)graduate chair are some titles to look for that would be able to help you); b) ask students on campus what they wore to their auditions or what standard audition/recital/rep lab attire is at that school; c) bring some accessories or an alternate outfit that you can easily change into if you show up and realize you're in the wrong clothes; or d) err on the side of formality and follow /u/ghoti023's advice to the T. (Although in all seriousness, I think wearing a full suit at my institution in Hawaii would get you some funny looks - overly formal attire can also be offputting, but usually slightly less of a faux pas). 

Also as a side note, don't forget to check the weather forecast. I don't know whose brilliant idea it was to schedule college auditions in the dead of winter, but there you have it. Because this time of the year is volatile (and the US is experiencing an exceptionally cold winter), be prepared with appropriate winter gear. If you're unfortunately from a place that doesn't actually have winter (like I am), look into borrowing/renting gear and secure that shit *well in advance*. Especially as a singer, catching a cold due to totally preventable attire issues is NOT a good idea. 

----

**REPERTOIRE**. It is important. As the OP says, choose repertoire that is appropriate for the program and do NOT cross genres unless you are explicitly told that it is okay. 

Just as importantly, though, is **preparation**. It is *much* better to sing a piece you are comfortable with and know well, than to start learning a piece a day before your audition. Even if this means choosing a slightly less apt piece, I think overall it is a better idea than singing something you don't know. If you need advice about repertoire, feel free to ask here or better yet, talk to your teacher. 

On obscure vs. ""popular"" pieces. This is a balance, but one that unfortunately a lot of young singers get wrong. Do NOT choose a piece just because the hipster in you wants to sing something super obscure. Chances are there are two reasons a piece is obscure - because it's not a very good piece, or because it's really, really hard. (Or the third option, because it's genuinely a hidden gem, but especially at the undergraduate level you probably don't have the resources or experience to find the gems in the rough.) Neither of those options makes for a good audition - don't set yourself up for failure with an exceptionally difficult piece or with music that isn't very good. In addition, auditioners can tell if you chose a piece for superficial reasons, and they probably won't treat it all that kindly. 

On the flip side, though, unless you really think you can 100% nail it, I'd advise against a piece that is too common. Don't make it easy to compare your flaws to the other 10 singers who sang the same exact piece on your audition. To a certain extent, singing the same rep as someone else is unavoidable, but unless you really have to, try not to use the ""top 10"" pieces in your genre, unless you truly feel it's the best piece for your voice. 

Anyway, I also want to put my two cents in that I'm open for questions related to college music life - I have a slightly different perspective than /u/ghoti023 as well, since my major is in a non-performance field. Remember that non-performance majors typically still have to perform an audition and declare a primary instrument, so you aren't out of the woods just because you plan on composition or music ed. The standards are different, though - going back to reading the university websites, be sure that you differentiate between audition requirements for vocal performance, and audition requirements for voice primaries in other fields.

Death_Urthrese,leagueoflegends,1390684335.0,"yeah, this is true.  when league was created it wasn't by a group of veterans so some mistakes were made in terms of optimal art.  currently it is all modeled out but from other angles especially in the montage videos it may show things that the art team doesn't want you to see.  there may be hidden texture seams they need to fix that weren't a problem before.  or perhaps the back of the graves or small objects are just flat and that would require an interesting texture.  maybe the way the graves are angled doesn't look as good when flipped.  even design is involved.  if during testing a single tree would block more visually on one side than another it would have to be changed.  i feel if we had a good view of what it would look like now if the camera was flipped we could see all the issues we aren't thinking about.

i don't want to try and say it can't be done but in terms of the amount of work it would take is it worth the time?  would we rather see new art for the current SR over a camera flip?  or new map modes?  if enough people in the community want it i can see doing it but i think the community would rather have something else.  

i don't know though, i don't really care for a camera flip over a new skin for SR.  what do you think?

EDIT: i should ask do you think it is worth the time or do you have something you personally would rather see?

Vordreller,Games,1390684347.0,"**League Of Legends**

I used to play it a lot and stopped after Season 3. I played both League and Dota2 at the same time, but switched to Dota2 exclusively. While it has its problems too, it was overall a more pleasant experience.

So I tried it again the past couple of days, with Season 4 having started. And after a couple of matches, I don't know why I should bother anymore.

The people I met in solo queue are such assholes, I wonder why I bother. People don't listen to advice. The part that I hate most is when the people you're trying to tell something to respond with something to the effect of ""Whatever, you're in the same league as me, so you're no better, asshole"". And then they taunt you every time you make a mistake.

It feels like the only reason these people play the game is to insult other people.

Dota2 has similar problems, but I've never encountered them so harshly as I do in League Of Legends."

EDIT: **AND** if you scroll up you'll see that one person tried to claim that Clinton's presidency, overall, wasn't ""a good one"", as in, better than average (which I find categorically false, since we *are* talking about US Presidents), and another redditor said, to quote, ""[Clinton] had just as many things to do with the ills of the world as the next two guys.""  Which is complete bullshit.  How many countries did Clinton send the military to occupy for a threat that simply didn't exist?  How many CIA agents were outed under Clinton, suspiciously mere weeks after the same agent's husband published an article in the NY Times very credibly rebuking the President's credibility on the matter of sending our troops to suppress a threat that, once again, didn't exist?  God, to say that Clinton's terms were a problematic as Bush 43's is either embarrassingly ignorant or shamelessly deceptive.

EDIT2: TL;DR -- the original question was whether Clinton's term were better than average.  Like you'll see I originally said, if we're discussing whether Clinton's reign was *perfect*, then that's a different discussion."

It is really humid where I live, and my hair can get unruly. I keep travel sized hair products in my purse, plus plenty of elastics and bobby pins, so I can keep it under control. I usually French braid my hair and tie it into a bun, and get lots of compliments. If you don't know how to French braid, just practice at home. 

I also keep perfume and a spare deodorant in my locker, just in case. 

I hope this helps. It's hard but we really are one of the first impressions guests have of the hotel, so we have to look good. "

blackleper,WritingPrompts,1390684735.0,"I awake with a start, coughing and clawing at burning gravel. I’m face down, scraping my face in it. My neck is frozen in pain, my nostrils and lungs burn.  My legs mangled and useless. Something went wrong. There was an explosion. I try to right myself. The glass shield of my helmet is gone, shattered away. I feel around for its remains with my gloved hands.

There’s light, but I can’t see. My eyes burn. Where’s the lander? I must have been thrown clear by the blast. I can barely breathe. I can’t move, and I can’t see. Tommy, I thought in panic. Tommy and Hollie. “Hercules 2,” I try. “Hercules 2, do you copy?”

I scoot up a little, fighting the pain, and strain to see ahead. I see dancing orange light—fire, great pillars of fire in every direction, stretching from gaping caverns in the rock into eternity.  

I rest a second, then push myself upward and try again. I can see a little now, shapes of light and rock and the lander-- there it is. Thirty meters away, maybe. I try my radio again. “Hercules 2, this is Commander Holiday, do you copy?” I fight the burn in my watering eyes and struggle to get a better look. “Captain Zepeda, this is Commander Holiday. Do you copy?” I blink away the tears and force my eyes wide open against the pain. The lander is sideways and partially buried in a small crater. The hatch is open, and thick black smoke is flowing out. Fuck, it’s crashed. Tommy and Hollie are dead.

I drop my head into the rock. It burns, but I don’t care. They’re dead. They’re dead and I’m going to die. 

Christ, I’m thirsty. 

We were so foolish to come here. So fucking arrogant. We wanted to be the first. They said we’d never reach it; they said we’d never make it back. So they were half right.

What becomes of me if I die here?

I feel a presence. I look up, and a startled wraith darts away, back into shadow. Harmless, I hope. I prop up on my elbows and force my eyes open. There are thousands of them, millions maybe. All watching me. They’re coming out of holes in the hill and holes in the ground. I see some moving in and out of the lander. They are throwing shit out of the hatch. Fucking scavengers. I see the white shape of Tommy’s body thrust from the opening. He lands a twisted wreck. I can’t see his face. I feel a jab in my back, and swat the brave one away. The whole horde is closing in. This is it. No more reprieve. "

I think the last episode changed a perspective for me and that ther was truth to her ""I'm cookie dough"" speech. 

Here's where I'll get hate. 

She loved Angel. She loved Riley. And then she realized maybe she didn't know what love was. 

Spike showed her that there's more to love than puppy dog eyes and butterflies. Spike (season 7) showed her love is something you have to know. He lived over a hundred years and didn't know love -- true love -- until Buffy. 

By the end Buffy knows she didn't love Riley. She may not have even truly lived angel. She knows she needs to learn who she is before she can know real love. "

The stars that are folded and hand-made, are used as gifts, mostly between couples, to signify how much you love or care about someone. The amount of stars that you give someone has significance as well. (i.e. 1,000 stars grants one wish.)

Hurricane043,NCSU,1390684828.0,"First of all, computer engineering and computer science are not so similar that you should settle for one over the other. Yes, they are similar, but both gear you up for a different type of job. 

You need to consider which you want to do. If you enjoy higher level software development (Java, SQL, C#, etc.), then computer science. If you enjoy lower level software development (C, C++) and also have hardware interest, go computer engineering. There is definitely overlap - as a CPE major, I can go into high level if I want, and I am considered for CSC jobs. 

It sounds like you are more interested in computer engineering. I was/am too, which is why I chose NC State. The added benefit for me was that if I decided I didn't like it, I could easily switch majors. On the other hand, if you go to UNC you are CSC or bust. 

UNC does have a better CSC program if that's what you want to do, but NCSU has a better engineering program and a pretty good CSC program anyway.

Once you decide what you want to do, make your decision based on that. You should be able to dispute the fact that NCSU didn't give you in-state tuition because if UNC did, NC State should too. "

Rodalli,todayilearned,1390684981.0,"It wasn't a rant, it's an explanation of why you're getting downvoted for calling it simply ""dubious"" and trying to state that Smith wasn't a complete scam, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. It's not dubious. The man was not in contact with god. He had not been given the keys to the one true religion. He was not the chosen one, just like the millions of others that came before him were not the chosen one. The guy was full of shit. He made it up.

What if I told you that god came to me in a dream last night and told me that all the previous people he came to in a dream had it wrong, and that all followers of His Word now have to wear special spectacles with runes etched into the glass in order to see His Truth? Would you start wearing my special spectacles (lenses made with holy sand anointed by a priest of Christ-Spectolism, limited time offer, only $49.99). Would you respect my ""faith""? Would you feel bad about telling me I was full of shit? No, you'd call me fucking nuts, have a chuckle at my expense (and rightfully so), and move on.

How/why is Joseph Smith different? How is Mormonism, or any religion, different? It's not. He's not. It's the exact same thing. Joseph Smith was a scam artist. The same as Jesus of Nazareth, L. Ron Hubbard, and Sylvia Browne.

It's not a question of respect. I can respect you as a person, and accept all the rights granted to you that come along with that. Immunity from criticism is not one of those rights. Bad ideas don't get protection from criticism simply because you stick a ""religion"" label on them. Shit still smells like shit, regardless of whether a portion of the population considers it sacred or not. Foolish proposals that people attempt to prop up in spite of overwhelming evidence are still foolish, and those ideas deserve to be criticized."

&gt; Hey, what does any of this have to do with kink?

Shows how poor your effort is at reading. See my parent comment that YOU replied to. How can i talk to some so flippant about refusing to actually read my posts.

&gt; **A troll on reddit once abruptly stopped talking to you about social justice warrioring, so that means asexuals in general are hogging the spotlight/legitimacy from other LGBT**

This is actually a good little quote to attack for willful fallacy, if trolling not bad.

'""Because you said this extreme thing happened, which we were talking about **separately elsewhere**, that means this conclusion you drew over several paragraphs **is based entirely on that?**""'

Its not worth dignifying with an answer. 

Seeing you raised the question, like it was dismissive of me: ""what does any of this have to do with kink?"" then go read the parent comment, your direct reply to it, and this direct segment of my reply to it: 

__________

&gt; &gt; I feel like asexuality is a legitimate orientation though...

Moving onto *science* and definitions.

Sexual Orientation: [The wikipedia definition.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation#Definitions_and_distinguishing_from_sexual_identity_and_behavior)

&gt; Sexual orientation is traditionally defined as including [heterosexuality], [bisexuality], and [homosexuality], **while [asexuality] is considered the fourth category of sexual orientation by some researchers** and has been defined as the absence of a traditional sexual orientation. An asexual has little to no sexual attraction to males or females.[3][4][5][6] It may be considered a lack of a sexual orientation,[18] and there is significant debate over whether or not it is a sexual orientation.[4][5]

I put the links in [brackets] to show each sexuality had a wikipedia page, but only asexuality needed justifying for inclusion within the article with references. I note, the **bolded** to me deserves a [citation needed] for completions sake. The remaining citations refer to what it essentially is, ""no sexual attraction to males or females"", and finally, the remaining citations state the aforementioned **some researchers** sit on a very controversial position.

docebt,nyc,1390685171.0,"&gt;To me, buying real estate here seems extremely risky.

Especially when one considers that it's basically investing on margin; it's why even a 10% decrease in the price of homes made a lot of people lose their shirts.  I bought a house at the very bottom of the market (after the dip, very early 2011) on the west coast before I moved here.  Even in a situation with nearly guaranteed improvement in value, I poured a lot of money into improving the place (I did a lot of the work myself, giving a great return on investment) instead of just letting myself be at the mercy of the housing market.  Owning real estate can be great for a variety of reasons, but with the political an economic situation in NYC, and with stock markets doing as well as they are, I agree that it's tough to view it as a great investment right now."

Euryleia,starcitizen,1390685180.0,"Right.  It needs to do that, because otherwise, the universe would feel as empty as OP feared.

If encounters at cruise speed were not forced by the matchmaker, we'd simply never encounter one another in space at all.

OP ironically feared that this system would make the universe seem emptier, when in fact it has the exact opposite effect: you'll be interacting with other players far more frequently than you otherwise would because of it.  It *is* what will make you feel like you're part of the game, which was the essence of OP's fears.  Instancing, and how it's done in this game, is the solution to OP's fears.  It's what makes you far, far *more* likely to see people around you than you otherwise would.  It's what will *enable* you to see people around you, and feel like you're part of the game."

CaptainSnacks,bicycling,1390685300.0,"I really, *really* like the Scott CR1 10.  It'll run you around $2500, and for that you get a suitably light carbon frame, Ultegra components and good wheels and still have $700 left in your budget!  The CR1 is one of the most comfortable bikes I've ever ridden, but it's still stiff enough to be a nice non-hardcore race bike.

If you really plan to race, I can't say steel is going to be a good idea.  While I've never personally raced a steel bike, I think the difference in weight spread out over a hard race will tax you more than a lighter carbon bike.  Steel is also more flexible-which makes for a great ride, but shitty stiffness.

ibbity,relationship_advice,1390685319.0,"You: RoK is a great blog to learn how to be a man!

me: RoK is a shitfest of a blog, here are some examples of how it is a shitfest

you: Those examples don't prove that it's a shitfest, even though they are clearly shitty! Also, I am totally in support of racism and sexism and I'm going to flat out lie about something that can very easily be proven true by simply reading the article!

Dipshit, the article states flat out ""women's selfishness makes men kill."" It then goes on to explain that ""there are hundreds of thousands of young men with insatiable sex drives who are receiving little to no sex from their female peers—not even the less attractive women whom traditionally would be paired off with less attractive men...Karl wanted to have sex...Claire is a beautiful young woman and is doubtlessly the object of affection for many young men who know her, including lonely and sexually frustrated ones...Karl had no chance to ever be with her and he knew it. And that’s why he encountered her in his school, armed with a gun, he turned it against her...So why wasn’t Karl at home relieving his sexual frustrations with a girlfriend on par with his looks instead of simmering in anger alone, writing typical angry teenaged political messages on his Facebook and purchasing guns? It is because the inherent selfishness of all women has been allowed to run rampant in our Western societies...**So long as society encourages women of all ages to be the inherently promiscuous creatures they are and allow them to limit their sexual choices to the men at the top of the pyramid (when many of them have no right to), sexually frustrated men will continue to lash out with extreme violence.The Columbine’s will continue. The Sandy Hook’s will continue. The Arapahoe’s will continue. Until society sits down and thinks over these problems with an unclouded mind, men will continue the shootings. More people will die just so Jane Doe can continue to ‘explore’ her sexuality.**

So, um, wanna go ahead and explain to me again how this DOESN'T blame school shootings on women being allowed to choose their own sex partners, and how a blog that says shit like this on the regular is somehow a great resource for learning how to be a man?

(P.S. The actual reason Karl shot up his school is that he had a beef with one of his teachers. Who happened to be male.)"

I'm interested to see where the community will move to.

SourceOP was always the hub for cash trading. Now it's gone.  
Outpost was the hub for the majority of trading. When those months are up and peoples' free premium dry up and they move, I can see it becoming less populated.
There's here, but it's a) not amazingly high traffic and b) usually lower-end trading. 
There's bazaar, but I don't know how much traffic they get, or will get.  
There's trade servers, but they've become useless in the past years.

It seems like there's a huge vacuum for high rep, high volume trading and I don't know what will fill it. Do any of the bigger trading communities (PPM, TF2-T, UTC, MCT) have active trading forums that people know of?

EDIT: http://forums.sourceop.com/threads/155909-Rep-thread-simply-gone was made. Rather than being helpful in any way, the response from the admin is 'not a SOP server issue'. No acknowledging that people have an issue, no acknowledging that anything is up on their end, just a straight up lock. The thread was 100% civil (I could understand it if it was a flame thread). This is just stupid.

I'd also like to make another point: Please don't decide to brigade SOP. Spamming, doxxing, insults and general abuse towards the site and its admins will get you nowhere. If you want anything to happen, be civil about it.

My bf and I had a similar problem at one point.  He always wanted to stay up really late, and then wanted to have sex after we got in bed to go to sleep.  I need more sleep than he seems to and I was always exhausted and about to fall asleep at that point.  Well, it wasn't the fact that it was night time that was making him horny, it was being naked in bed with me.  So what we do now is find some time to go lay down earlier in the day and just cuddle, talk, and connect.  Frequently this leads to sex, but it doesn't always have to.  It's a pleasant thing to do together and helps us both connect emotionally and physically after a long, hard day, which makes getting turned on and having sex a lot easier.

So, if you don't want to have sex because you're tired from work, maybe just try laying down and snuggling for a while, knowing that sex is a possibility but not a necessity."

But this is using the definition of rape as ""forced penetration"". The rest of male rape victims who are ""made to penetrate"" are addressed separately under other kinds of sexual violence.

If you take into account the numbers of men who are ""forced to penetrate"" in rape statistics the figures are pretty damn close to 50/50.

I'm only 1.5 years hrt, so there is still plenty of time.  If she is fixed in wanting big breasts ba is certainly an option, but she should have at least a year of hrt or more.

Softer skin, fat redistribution, hair pattern changes (especially down there), less body hair, loss of muscle mass, height loss, feet shrinkage, vision changes are all things she can expect.  Emotional changes are huge!  Feelings become felt, point of view shifts in ways that are hard to explain.  Idk if you are male or female, but either way you will notice it.

I had an orchiectomy, since my child bearing days are behind me, so that may help in the fight against T.  After about a year on antiandrogens she may be able to get that covered with the medical diagnosis of testicular atrophy.
