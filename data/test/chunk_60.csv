ScipiiRye,gainit,1390245414.0,"Grip strength is an important part of deadlifts. If you're worried about hurting yourself there are a few exercises you can work on to get your grip strength up a bit.

Finger curls with dumbbells and wrist curls with barbells are a good way to up forearm and grip strength. 

Another thing you can learn are the different types of grips, over/over, over/under (mixed) and hook. You could start by doing lighter weights for endurance with over/over.

Or, you could lift at a challenging weight and switch to over/under when you start to flag until you're confident enough.

You won't hurt yourself if you have the form down and aren't trying to lift beyond your capabilities."

dmgb,AskWomen,1390245517.0,"I've been single for almost four years now. I had fuck buddies, would date every now and then. But I always felt like I was trying to force things into taking a turn towards getting serious. And every time I'd realize that I was doing that, I would lose interest. I didn't want to settle - and that's kind of how it seemed to be. Each of those people had traits I wasn't really interested in. Red flags. Deal breakers. Etc. I started to worry that maybe I just wasn't meant to find the person who was right for me.

Then a couple weeks ago, I was out at the bar with some friends I haven't seen in a while. No big deal. Just a nice, casual Friday night. I'm friends with the bouncer at the bar, have been since I started going there three years ago. But something about him that night just struck me. And something about me must have suddenly struck him as well, because I ended up going home with him that night. We've been practically inseparable ever since. I'm making him dinner tomorrow night and we're going to discuss exclusivity and making this an official relationship.

I haven't had to force anything. I'm not questioning his feelings. I don't feel used. It honestly feels perfect. Effortless. We're both so happy, and everyone that has seen us together keeps telling us how perfect we are for one another. 

It was so worth the wait. Never settle. Never give up on yourself and finding that person that might just be the one for you. Hell, they could be under your nose for years and you just never knew.

AdamColligan,AskMen,1390245715.0,"This is written a bit densely for a Wikipedia article, but I would recommend that you take a gander through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_forecasting 

Long story short: people tend to overstate the emotional impact and permanence of the effect on them of big events, like losing a limb, or a family member dying, or maybe (in your case) moving from single status to married status.  It turns out that in many cases, the things that matter more to happiness are the little everyday benefits or annoyances.  Here is an old NYT article that summarizes the effect: http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/07/magazine/the-futile-pursuit-of-happiness.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm . 

TL;DR: most people are better off getting their heart broken and then moving on than living in a tense marriage.  It's good that you are a person who can ""tolerate a lot"".  But if you follow the research, and if you're within a normal range of people in general, you are probably tending to overestimate how much day-to-day frustration it's worth putting up with in order to get a ""big prize"" like changing  your status to ""married""."

lordfuzzywig,Warthunder,1390245746.0,"&gt;Sure, you can earn points for 5 planes if you want to go through that many, but each one will get points at 1/5th the rate as a single plane would have; e.g., you don't magically get twice the rp because you decided to spawn a second plane.

Except you do. Because in RB, you have only one plane period. In AB, you continue to earn RP. In RB, it's one and done.

In RB, if you get a kill at the 15:00 mark and then die, that's all the RP you get. In AB, if you get a kill at the 15:00 mark and die, you can spawn another plane instantly and get more RP. No climbing to altitude necessary, no waiting for queue, none of that. Poof, you're there with another plane earning more RP. That's a pretty simple concept.

&gt;I have something like 150-200 RB matches with B-17s and I quite assure you can destroy more than 8 ground targets. For example, you can land, rearm, and get a new load of bombs so your use of 'at most' is woefully misapplied here.

Sorry for not saying ""in one run"". But if we're being honest, you're lucky to get one in to completion.

&gt;To be specific, the game rewards a 'participation/time' quotient, participation being earned by killing ground or air targets.

This is precisely what I'm saying, bud.

If I feel like flying escort for my squad, I get no reward at all despite being integral to the success of the mission, or for spending the time to get to a superior energy state where I can assure that I will win a dogfight. It is more prudent -- and wrongly so -- to just engage the enemy and leave the bombers on their own, for example, than to play as a team."

People will always be on your back in the lines and come very, very close to you (the way you know what they had for lunch). Most people will try to cut you and if give a slight sign of weakness they will take the opportunity.

BullsLawDan,Libertarian,1390245918.0,"&gt;So how would a court ""see through"" regulations banning all signage on public property?

Well, this is not a regulation that does that.  I linked to the regulations elsewhere in the thread.  This regulation aims to control signs affixed to places, or buildings, in terms of their size and design.  It's clearly aimed at commercial installations.  The only part of the regulation that deals with a sign being held by a human is the ""human sign"" subsection, which is specifically for commercial activity.  This municipality, near as I can tell, does not have an anti-picketing ordinance (or at least he was not charged under that ordinance).

&gt;Do you have examples of other people holding signs in the same locale who were not arrested for violating that law?

Obviously, such an item would not be newsworthy.  However, [this thread](http://www.frisco-online.com/forums/showthread.php?823587-Protest-Tomorrow) on another message board shows that, in the same city, protesters were standing in a similar spot, holding ""Impeach Obama"" signs and similar.  I cannot find any record of Frisco police arresting anyone for such a display.

[Here](http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/steve-blow/20110702-frisco-couple-pickets-nursing-home-and-protests-texas-lawsuit-limits-.ece) is a story about a couple protesting a nursing home's seeming malpractice.  You'll note that, in the story, the picture accompanying is one of the protester talking to a police officer... Without being arrested.  

Finally, [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrb7MeLTZCc) is a video of some protesters outside a pet store, protesting puppy mills.  Again, no arrests.

So, yeah, I would say there's a preponderance of evidence the police arrested him due to the content of the sign.

&gt;That doesn't render the underlying statute unconstitutional. 

But it might render his arrest unconstitutional.  I'm not arguing the statute itself is unconstitutional.

Just as it would be unconstitutional to use DWI statutes to break up a protest, it is unconstitutional to use a sign statute, in many cases, to arrest someone holding a peaceful demonstration."

ANewMachine615,AskReddit,1390246011.0,"The difference is that Sansa clings to hers for far longer than anyone else (well, save perhaps Robb).

SPOILERS AHEAD.

Arya gives up being a soldier and warrior pretty early on, becoming Weasel or Nan or anything but a noted warrior. Jon is pretty much done with his dreams by the time he kills Halfhand, if not before that. Robb is disabused of the romantic ideas of his kingship by the Karstarks and Freys' abandonment, even before the wedding. 

Sansa, meanwhile, holds on to her dream of being rescued pretty much right up 'til the moment Ser Dontos dies, and she realizes she'd been delivered from a very public place of extreme danger overseen by psychopaths, to a very private place of extreme danger overseen by a psychopath. So Arya, Jon, and Robb are all pretty much done with their dreams by the end of Book 2, while Sansa holds onto hers until the end of Book 3, long after everyone else has seen what's happening.

There's another element, too: Jon, Robb, and Arya all have fantasies in which they have agency and power. Sansa's fantasy is to be a helpless maid kept safe by a strong and noble prince. I think that might be part of why the others give up on theirs much quicker (since the goal is, basically, to have agency eventually) while Sansa holds onto it, waiting for her dream to come true. When a dream is impossible, it's much easier to see if it's your job to be the one making the dream happen than if you're waiting for someone else to do it for you."

However, the finish is super frosty (but not glittery) so if you're not into that this whole collection probably won't be for you. In pigmentation and color, it looked very similar to my MAC Mineralize blush in Gleeful; Mauve was a smidge peachier and with a frosty finish. I only tried it on after I bought it last night, so I can't speak of the longevity yet, but based on what I've seen so far the prognosis is good.

Kaisharga,asexuality,1390246142.0,"It's more that virginity isn't a something you have to give away, it's a thing that you're actively *not* doing. Saying you're ""proud to be a virgin"" is similar to being proud that you've never driven a stick shift. (The metaphor applies further here, too: Your first time driving stick shift is bound to be pretty bad no matter how much you have researched the subject, it gets better over time, and eventually just feels natural, and then even if you go back to automatic you may still miss it even though you get by just fine.)

Also it contributes to the trivialization, marginalization, and general sexualization of women, by putting a more value on what they've done with a specific part of their body than most anything else they have accomplished to that point. And let's not even get into the homosexuality bit (how do you classify when virginity is ""lost?"") or the interesting things [some people do (nsfw-lyrics)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8ZF_R_j0OY) to avoid losing such a precious asset.

ANYWAY, glad I could help! College is crazytimes, especially on a resident campus--I'm actually returning to college myself, and am quite thankful that it's a more adult culture here promoted by the commuter-oriented structure. Stuff is good!"

1. It doesn't have to be photoshop flawless, I feel pressure to do it as photoshop flawless as possible because I take pride in it but some of the girls don't give too many fucks. 
2. I've had a good experience with 95% of my coworkers, the managers are super nice, it can be quite clique-y though, but not in the mean way necessarily. 
3. I've never been into Ulta so I can't say either way, I think Sephora might get more ""spoiled bitch"" type customers...maybe. 
4. I've spent more money on make-up in the three months I've worked there than I have in a really long time, this is what everyone does at first then you realize you can take samples home and it becomes less so. You're also just straight up allowed to do your make-up backstage at Sephora if you care to. 
5. Again, can't speak to Ulta but at Sephora most definitely not. We have different people for different areas, any employee might be expected to be able to give recommendations but not apply make-up. I'm at the register and I've never applied, I've advised but never applied. 

Hope this helps! "

oog76,LongDistance,1390246175.0,"I think most LD couples deal with friends like this at one point or another. If they're good friends, this probably comes from a place of caring and not wanting to see you get hurt. The greatest way to quiet their opinions is to prove them wrong and/or let them get to know each other. However, these are long term options and if they make a habit of making remarks about or generally ragging on your relationship, patiently explain that this is your decision, you've thought about it for a while, you know your SO well enough and believe that you are making a good decision. Maybe add that you were hoping for support from them because they are your friends, but if they don't like your relationship to keep it to themselves. 

If they continue their negativity, give yourself some space from them. 
As you said, you don't want that kind of energy around you, especially when you are just starting your relationship. In my experience, I've become more confident in my relationship over time and have found it exponentially easier to shake off anyone who tries to tell me something about my relationship. Your relationship is between you and your SO. If doesn't really matter if people don't like it, because they are not part of it. "

1: I am a bit bemused over your mention of a base class, without even making a mention of the core class druid (minor point, though).

2: The Eidolon can only tank one enemy and eventually has to go through several threatened squares, which allow him to reach one member of the group in need of help.

3: By choosing the summoner, you are greating another person on the field in need of protecting (namely the summoner), a problem you would have more rarely with a druid (beast shape etc.).

4: The druid has more versatility in terms of tankiness, he can either exchange a prepared spell for one strong summoned monster against a boss or summon a lot of slightly smaller critters with the same spell, that he can summon pretty much anywhere he wants. The tank will come to the one who needs it in one turn, no matter what (except for cases where the druid is taken out, which, in most cases, would also affect a summoner).

5: You get pretty much the same thing (albeit a bit weaker) as the summoner with your animal companion. If tanking is your main concern, this role can be easily filled by one of many potential creatures."

mkvgtired,news,1390246237.0,"For the most part it has nothing to do with Western titans of industry. Look at the countries with the poorest people. Most have very little developed industry, so the western companies exploiting the population for profit argument is not very applicable. 

I took a motorcycle trip through rural Vietnam. You would see lots of farmers barely surviving than a huge house with several expensive cars in the middle of it all. I asked someone why that was and they explained to me the communist party members were the only people allowed to borrow money from the state owned banks at below market rates. They would buy up huge swaths of land and lease it back to farmers. They would essentially create serfdoms where farmers are barely making a subsistence living, while they get rich. Factories making Western goods would arguably be a huge improvement to their lives. 

In neighboring Cambodia a very large percentage of the population makes US$20 per month or less. Granted this buys more than in the west, but even there it only buys a shitty existence. I was going through rural Cambodia I passed a *massive* house that was walled off. There was well over $1 million worth of cars in the driveway. Leaning up against the wall of the home were shanties. Prominently displayed out front was the flag of the ""Cambodian People's Party.""

Wealth is not a finite pie. If living standards are raised in one place it does not follow they have to be taken away from another place. Just because someone is a billionaire in the US does not mean others are forced to do without because of it.

Say I can afford to go to Hawaii, but my partner cannot because they are in too much debt. That affects me and my lifestyle. I want to be with someone who can go with me. Hence, it is affecting me. 

&gt;not a reason for someone to have their right to privacy waived and have to tell you this or that ""up front""

Their right to privacy isn't waived. They can decline to talk about it, but then I would leave. Privacy still intact. 

&gt;So no, dating someone because he or she can buy you a car is not different to me than dating a person because he or she can pay for a house and your future children's college.

But it isn't even about them buying YOU things. Its about you being able to buy things TOGETHER. I don't have debt, and don't make that much money, but enough to enjoy life. I expect my partner to bring the same thing to the table. 

TL:DR - Expecting your partner to not give a crap about your financial situation is naive. Life is short. I'd rather spend the short time with someone who has the means to live a life on par with what I make. If that makes me a gold digger, then I will gladly take that compliment while I am sipping drinks on a beach in Thailand while the non gold diggers in my situation are pulling their partners out of debt for the next  20 years.

bunker_man,Christianity,1390246357.0,"...I'm not sure what you're even saying. You want to be christian, but think that there's not enough evidence for it? There's a few things that can help with that.

First, look into christian atheism and christian deism. (also christian agnosticism obviously, though I don't think there's a wikipedia page for that.) These are good first steps, since they tell you how to learn christianity as a philosophy rather than a religion. These are easy first steps, since you don't have to assume anything before you want to, and can begin identiying with it.

Then begin to look into pantheism then panentheism. If you have too literal an idea of God it might seem unlikely. It's best to begin with realizing it's a huge philosophical area of gradients that can mean many things. This may help you to find out which parts it is that you're searching for in order to help accept them faster.

Once you do those two things, you'd be more than halfway there already. You can see whether you want to go further or what you want to do from there."

You'd have to eat 466 extra calories each day to truly gain 10 lbs in 2.5 months. It sounds like a lot, but that's a small glass of eggnog and a few cookies. Or ten mini Snickers.

SmartDrug,CCW,1390246412.0,"I'm not trying to scold you like a child but you are asking the wrong questions here.   You're talking about the safety preventing an ND but the two guns you have couldn't be more different in that aspect, one is SAO, designed to be carried cocked and locked, the other is DAO with only a passive safety.  

The impression you give off when asking which is ""safer"" is that you rely on the safety to prevent NDs.  Neither is ""safer"" than the other, that lies in your hands.  

The accuracy, as I said in a previous post, won't really matter either, you shouldn't be in a situation where you're using this defensively outside of 15y or so, at which range, either will be 100% fine if you've practiced.

Lastly, the draw speed is VERY important, you're talking about using a firearm in a situation that is literally a race for life and saying that 1/2 second doesn't matter.  That's ridiculous.

The reason for my being critical is that your post asks the wrong questions completely.  You're not concerned with the stuff that does matter (draw time) and hung up on things that don't really involve the firearm (basic firearms safety).  You should do more research on defensive pistol theory before you make a decision, maybe take a course or two and rent a pistol.

The Bible isn't nearly as clear-cut as the color of the sky (although, that's [not so clear-cut either, actually](http://www.radiolab.org/story/211213-sky-isnt-blue/)).  The Bible is huge, there are difficult passages that at least look like contradictions all through it, it's the work of hundreds if not thousands of people all combined into one giant tome.

And sure, the Bob Joneses are nutcases, but can you say the same of all of the people quoted?  Martin Luther?  The entirety of the Christian pro-slavery movement, which was hardly negligible?  You can't dismiss them all as wackos.  

The author of the blogpost isn't saying that because these people were wrong, you can't make an argument based on the Bible.  She's saying that even though your argument is based on the Bible, you may well still be wrong.

And if you realize that there was a time when these arguments were actually being argued, you can't pretend that they were ""simply bad arguments"".  If there was a large enough faction to have two large movements slinging back and forth at each other - which there were - the arguments can't be ""simply bad"".  They might be to you, because you don't support slavery to begin with, for example.

We can't pretend that arguments today aren't tinged by the same bias that the pro-slavery arguments were tinged with, and some people are hanging on to the few bits of scripture they can to construct a decent argument for or against, say, gay marriage or abortion?  Do you have opinions about which of those arguments are ""simply bad"" arguments?  

Because 100 years from now, I'm pretty confident that - at least on homosexuality, within western culture at least - we're going to be looking back at one side of the argument with just as much perplexity and shame as we do slavery, and we'll say that they were clearly ""simply bad arguments""."

All I want to do is sit on the couch and play with a normal controller. Some buttons, some triggers, a stick or two, and maybe a D-pad. That's why I buy consoles. Is that too much to ask? Apparently, because some of the biggest titles (I'm looking at you, Twilight Princess) don't support the classic/pro controllers. 

And why do they have to shove it down your throat? Why can't the default controller be normal with the optional addon of a Wii-mote? If it were truly as great as Nintendo believes it is, then people would eventually come to buy/love it anyway.

What you've said about their game selection is also true -- aside from Zelda, people aren't 100% sure about what they'll be getting. I think this is a result of Nintendo's naivete when it comes to hardware. They thought they could get by on gameplay alone and allow their hardware to lag behind everyone else's, but it turns out they were wrong. Very wrong.

Some places have only professional, for-pay EMS agencies, some have a mix of volunteer and professional, and some are based entirely out of the fire service (which again, may or many not be volunteer).

I was an EMT at your age and worked with a volunteer agency. The shifts I was allowed to take and the things I was allowed to do were limited. I couldn't drive any of the vehicles, I couldn't be the ""lead"" EMT during calls, I couldn't work past 12PM. 

If I were you, I would call my local EMS agency or agencies and just ask them about ride along programs. Some have them and some don't. If they do, they might have a class you have to take before you go or have some minimal requirements you must meet. The same goes with volunteering. 

When I signed up to volunteer for the EMS agency and later on with the fire department, I had to go through and interview and background check just like I would with a normal job. "

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1390246694.0,"&gt; And then you have the girls in their early 20s, full of life, sexy and tight, who tell you ""I'm not going to settle down until I'm 30+"". You just want to slap them and tell them to get a grip, they have the wrong idea, and they are going to fuck their lives up, piss away their prime years because they are following the herd.

I don't think it's so much blindly following the herd. They are making rational decisions based on the information they've received. Feminism has made it nearly impossible to criticize women in any capacity that discourages female behavior men don't like. Many women live in a bubble that society tip-toes around trying not to damage. So they sort of live in a world not realizing that there will be consequences. Every privilege in life they've received they feel entitled to. Feminism has told them that they can do whatever they want.

What I find interesting is that many women do recognize this on some sort of level because most realize that they will have to marry around 30 because the ability to fuck around in lala land is clearly diminished at this point. However, again not knowing what life is like w/o female privilege, just assume that they'll get Prince Charming once they hit that age when they are ready to settle. 

Again, I wouldn't say this is entirely women's fault as a whole, but more about feminism telling them this is how they should behave. Feminism does a great job at removing agency from women. They tell them, ""Just wait until 30 then find a man. And if you end up having a hard time, remember it's not your fault for not finding one because you failed to live up to the opposite gender's standards in dating, but because men are evil. It's the man's fault you can't find Prince Charming. It's because men are assholes who wont let you have your cake and eat it too!""

What I find slightly astonishing is the degree in which they still recognize the truths about the mating game, yet completely disregard it, leaving them in a tangled mess of confusion. Look at how insecure women are these days. Most of this comes from, in my opinion, the fact that society is telling them not to worry about holding themselves to a higher standard. While deep down they know what they are doing is hurting their long term game. They know deep down that fucking around, getting tats all over the place, and becoming a cow is going to hurt them. So instead of actually playing the game, they get insecure and complain how it's not fair that men have standards that don't let them be the hoe they want to be for a short while.

steve496,49ers,1390246734.0,"Cowboy: no.  He's still under contract for 2 more years, we have 4 young guys under the age of 25 to develop across the line (Williams, Jerod-Eddie, Caradine, and Dial), and we have too many other needs to worry about that problem right now.  At least not until the middle rounds - a popular pick in mocks I've seen has us picking up Dominique Easley (who, like Carradine, has first-round talent but, like Carradine, will fall because he's recovering from an ACL) in the 3rd.  That sort of move makes a lot of sense to me, but its also about as early as I can see us picking someone up for the defensive front 7.

The prioritization between WR, CB, and S depends a lot on who we keep in free agency.  My gut is that Boldin and Whitner are more likely to be back than Rogers or Brown, so I suspect our top need winds up being CB.

That said: I don't expect us to be that aggressive about trading up.  This is a very deep class, and we're going to be able to get some talented players - particularly at WR - into the 2nd and even 3rd round.  Our extra 2nd and 3rd picks are more valuable than they'd be in some other draft classes, so I expect the front office to be less quick to relinquish them to chase after any particular prospect.  That is: while we *could* get to the early teens using KCs 2nd and the Titan's 3rd, I think the more likely trade by far is something more akin to what we did for Eric Reid - 30 + 77 for ~20 to grab some prospect we like in that range, so we can keep our 2nd-round picks to fill other needs.

In short: its not about how high we can trade up; its about finding trades up that are too good a deal to pass up.  If Sammy Watkins falls a bit and we can trade 30 + 56 + 77 to get to 10 and take him - fantastic, lets do it.  But I don't think there are many players that we'd want to do that for.  In general we're probably better off using our three 1st + 2nd round picks to get a WR, a CB, and a S instead of one really awesome player at any of those positions."

AdamColligan,AskMen,1390246899.0,"I don't think there's anything wrong with pursuing marriage now if marriage now is what you want. But as you do so, I think the lesson is to keep in mind that you are looking for a partner in everyday life for years to come. In other words, you are auditioning someone to *be married with*, not just someone to *get married to*. And that means you have to be honest with yourself about applying standards to potential suitors, even if that means it takes much longer to find one that works for you.

Also remember that if you get into a long-term relationship that you are not happy with, your husband is probably going to be aware of this too, and that can be a very difficult thing for a man as well. It's not just unfair to *yourself* to say that you're not bothered about what your husband is like and can tolerate most anything as long as he will marry and respect you. It's also unfair to *him* if he ends up in a situation where he really can't make you happy, and he has to live with that every day."

TimDaEnchanter,funny,1390246905.0,"Your article stated that there were a few specific schools that prohibited dodgeball, and left the implication that there were significantly more schools that did not prohibit dodgeball.  Also, a statement of truth is not an opinion.  While it may or may not be deliberately argumentative, it is not an opinion.  An opinion would have been ""I liked dodgeball,"" or ""Dodgeball should be played in schools.""  However, a statement of fact, such as ""A specific event happened in the past"" is not an opinion, nor should it ever be misconstrued as one.  The web definition of opinion is ""A view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge.""  My statement was not a view or judgment: it was an event that happened that proved that what you said was incorrect.

I would suggest that you learn the difference between a fact that disproves your statement and an opinion.  If you want to actually come across as intelligent, you should admit your mistakes instead of attacking the other person and claiming that their facts they present are in fact opinions when it is blatantly obvious that their facts are facts that disprove your statement.

Your article did prove that there were several school districts that banned dodgeball.  However, if you read the full article, it implied that the specific few states and regions mentioned may have banned dodgeball, but the majority of states and regions (which weren't mentioned) did not ban dodgeball, or else they would have been mentioned in the article too.  It was clear to me from reading the article that there was a small group of people who had banned dodgeball and that, while they were pushing other schools to ban dodgeball, most hadn't at the time the article was written."

mrcleanup,Pathfinder_RPG,1390247009.0,"You substitute a sunder attack in place of a melee attack. Each sunder attempt triggers an attack of opportunity unless you have a feat that negates it. If you hit, then you do damage to the armor, but it has a hardness of 10, so the first 10 points of damage from each attack don't count (you handle each separately, and not as a full round total, so a full round flurry doing 9, 5, 12, 10, 8, 12 would be a total of 4 damage for example after negating the first 10 points of damage of each attack). Of course, that is if you can hit them.

Once the damage for an attack is more than 10, you apply the overage damage to the armor. The standard HP for armor is the armor bonus x 5. Full plate has an armor bonus of 9, multiply by 5, you get 45 Hit Points. Magic armor will have more hit points based on the bonus adding into the armor bonus. For example +2 full plate would have 55 HP (11 x 5).

When you have done damage greater than or equal to half the HP of the armor (23 HP for regular full plate) then the armor bonus for the armor is halved rounding down (to 4 in this case), and the armor penalty is doubled.

Once you reduce the HP of the armor to 0 then it is considered ""destroyed."" It doesn't mention whether the armor falls off at that point or not so you and your DM might have to figure that out. If it doesn't fall off, it could be argued that they would still have the armor check penalty even though they no longer get the armor bonus.

So the real question, is at level 20 with KI strike, how likely are you to hit someone wearing full plate and do more than 10 points of damage in one hit, and how long will it take to accumulate 23 or 45 HP worth of damage after taking the 10 hardness into account?"

I can, unfortunately, also understand why the justice system wouldn't want to touch a case as old as this one (and yours). It is simply too unreliable to go based only on memory with no physical evidence. It sucks, but it probably keeps just as many people out of jail who *shouldn't be there* as *should be there*, if that makes sense."

gantt5,battlefield_4,1390247212.0,"Zeroing your weapon essentially means you tilt the scope so that it is no longer parallel with the weapon's barrel. It doesn't change how the bullet drops, but it does change when the bullet crosses the line made by your eye and the end of the scope. The amount of downward acceleration is always constant. If you think about it in 1 second intervals, the amount of acceleration is always the same, but with each passing second the downward velocity the object already has is greater, meaning it falls faster and faster.

For a more day-to-day example, when you're in your car and you step gently on the gas you increase your speed at a constant rate. That is a constant acceleration. However, if you stomp on the gas and get thrown back in your seat, your acceleration is accelerating. (Sorry, I'm a physics nerd.)

Now back to BF, if you draw the line from your eye to the end of the scope and make it the x-axis on my graph, the result will [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/YYaWo7w.jpg). 

After 1000m, you should be using the SRR or the M98B. (I only plotted the SRR zeroed at 500m and 1000m because I'm lazy and the graph would get too cluttered to see anything short of 500m very quickly.) You have to compensate for the recoil manually at those distances. You can set the zeroing for 1000m to make it easier, but after that it's guess and check.

BF4 does take into account the angle of the weapon. I factored that out of my calculations by assumption, though. I essentially assumed that to be making shots in excess of 500m, you have to fire the weapon more or less parallel to the ground. Therefore, I can make my plane of reference the barrel of the gun (in my original graph) or the sight of the gun (the above graph) and have a small error in the amount of drop (well less than a meter even at very long range) due to the change in angle relative to the ground."

You can mix them, but you have to take into consideration the flavor profiles to figure out which cheese to use. For your bacon/egg sandwich, the smoked gouda would be great. I love the flavor. Personally though, I would use ham instead of bacon with gouda, since the bacon will have more flavor."

You aren't even helping them by not killing them and letting them soak exp and farm unless you are standing still in lane far enough away that you aren't gaining any yourself. If you are farming and gaining exp too, then you're doing nothing for them. You will still be those items you've gotten ahead and he will still be underleveled.

If we wanted fairplay we should get rid of runes and masteries as well. I don't have an AP rune page, because i play AD (top lane) champions and jungle (with ad champions as well), but today my teammates were refusing to let me have any role where i could play AD and i was forced to play an AP champ not only for the first time ever, but with the wrong runes and masteries.

In these situation, should you let them free farm and get a couple AP items ahead as well? Because once you fight someone with Tier 3 runes while you haven't got any, then you're at a massive disadvantage.

Unfortunately, at my dog park, which is in a young/hip part of town, it is all too common for someone not qualified to own a pit bull to have one. You can just tell as soon as the dog gets off the leash that its gonna be a problem. The owner doesn't know what to do, as if its scared of the dog (this is the biggest red flag for any dog, if you see a dog like this at the dog park, you should leave). They have a shock collar, or yell, or follow the dog closely. In the end, it's not that the dog is bad, it's just a product of its environment. Inevitably, the dog bullies, it aggravates people trying to play with their dogs, it's aggressive with smaller dogs. Most of the time, their isn't a fight, but then, when there is, that's when you wish this person had a yorkie or something. Now, this is the kind of stuff that happens whenever you have a bad/unqualified owner, but, for some reason, bad/unqualified owners, LOVE PITT BULLS!

To answer your questions point by point as a dominant man who has enjoyed a few long term 24/7 relationships with submissive women.



What are some ways you've been dominated, or controlled?
*Total dominance in the bedroom, I liked my girls to be adventurous and willing to initiate but if they were doing something not to my liking I wouldn't hesitate to ""change things up"" into a more pleasing positions/acts. I was always in charge of the house finances, generally if my drink ran dry my girl would go and refill/replace it. I would always be served my food by my girls. They would keep up the house, they would wear what I told them to. Generally speaking I enjoyed those kind of 24/7/365 ""Total power Exchange"" relationships* 



Is it something that happened intermittently or was it full time?
*Most have been full time, I tend to enjoy the ""24/7"" ones better but I have experienced both* 


Did it ever cross into a public setting or social setting?
*Yes and no. I never took any of my girls around on a leash or fetish gear in public. They would get my drinks, speak only when spoken to, always follow behind me, etc in public*




Was it what you had fantasized it would be like?(this one is important)
*Yes and no. It is what I have always wanted, I had an LTR with my ex girl for the better part of 7 eyars. It was good for most of it but the last 1-1.5 years sucked. Like any kind of relationship they fail more often than not*




If the relationship ended, who ended it, and did it have anything to do with your sex life?


*I ended it and it had nothing to do with sex, it was all about her dishonesty and unwillingness to work at the relationship. Her needs changed , mine did not*





Hope I helped some!

ProffieThrowaway,AskAcademia,1390247454.0,"It's sort of bullshit, but some states do have textbook laws--some of them deal with keeping prices down and giving students a fair shot at buying the book somewhere other than the University, and some deal with age of material. 

But nobody is going to drag you off in chains for using an older edition, therefore some of us just inform our students to buy whatever edition wherever they can. We are generally tenured or tenure track and don't really have to worry (much) about telling the school to screw off about these sorts of issues. 

There is a problem in my field with outdated books--I teach English, and if you teach a ""reader"" for freshman composition that is supposed to be super up to date and have readings that will ""interest today's student,"" that stupid book will be good for a year or two at the most. These sorts of books have lots of reprinted articles from places like newspapers, and so their topics get out of date super quickly. 

Textbook manufacturers tell us these are good books to use because students are bored by what used to be in these books--articles from a wide range of time periods, for example--but I think it's bullshit to sell more books. When the book is a year old some students will complain on evals that the book talks about things that aren't relevant to them, because freshmen just came out of high school and four years ago seems like a LONG TIME. 

The other reason that those books are crap perpetrated by the corporate entities that print them is that nearly all the readings are available for free online. In the past when I've had to teach from them I casually inform my students of this, sometimes even by e-mail before the class begins. Some students still buy the text because they want a book copy and dislike reading on a screen, and some ""don't get"" what I was trying to say, but many do. 

All that said, it's not like you can't illegally download half the textbooks out there anyway....."

BullsLawDan,Libertarian,1390247634.0,"You don't have a choice to ""contract,"" so long as you are within their jurisdiction.  If you violate the law, you can be arrested regardless of whether you consent to some fictional contract.

Again, the power of a court is not set by whether someone contracts to it, it is set by jurisdictional statutes."
Laozen,taoism,1390247634.0,"You always have to watch what you give and to whom you give it.  It's one thing to give your money to those who need it when they need it so that they, too, can come back into balance and their troubles may abate a while, but it's another thing to give to the point where you have exhausted everything you have to the degree that you cannot keep giving; you have no means left to give anything, so when someone else in trouble comes along, you'll be in no position to help, so making a beggar of yourself is not necessarily in and of itself the most broadly generous act possible, it's why nonprofits, for example, generate revenue and ask for donations so they can continue to operate, presumably to help others (whether or not they do or whether they waste their funds depends on the nonprofit, naturally!).

However, I will say that to give as much as you can happily, with the knowledge that you aren't losing anything important is the mark of someone who understands a fundamental truth about compassion; that is, that whoever you give it to is as much a part of the Tao as you are, and in fact that whatever separate distinctions you make between them are at best temporary.  You come from the same source as them; you, as the Tao, as the fundamental Self or suchness (tathata), are acting both the part of yourself and the one you give to.  At that fundamental level then, there's no great loss to you by giving to others, even very valuable things.

But as with all things, you have to feel it out.  I think a good rule of thumb is ""Don't be a greedy douche,"" and everything else will fall into place from there.  Chapter 46 seems like a good example of this:
&gt;When the world follows the Tao,
horses run free to fertilize the fields.
When the world does not follow the Tao,
war horses are bread outside the cities.

&gt;There is no greater transgression
than condoning people's selfish desires,
no greater disaster than being discontent,
and no greater retribution than for greed.

&gt;Whoever knows contentment will be at peace forever.  "

I think one creepy aspect is that he's basically paying for company, and I would be worried that he would expect sex or intimacy as part of the deal.

The way the message descends is also quite worrying. 'I consider you a good friend' and 'come chill at my pad' and then the pushiness of '4pm Tuesday' is like... eep.

Breakfast_King,swtor,1390247926.0,"More maps/game modes will be nice indeed.  And yeah, ranked seems like a given.

In my head, the difference between wanting space pvp to be cross character and ground pvp character bound is because your actual character makes much less of an impact on space pvp than it does on the ground.  To go to my example with my Scoundrel and Vanguard:  I leveled my scoundrel up through the Valor ranks.  All the while becoming better at playing scoundrel (at least I hope so) and also getting gear that is only relevant to scoundrels.  When I made my vanguard, it was a completely different skill set to learn.  Grinding valor again also meant I was practicing the class and getting gear that only a trooper can use.

With the space game, each of these characters has almost exactly the same tools and gear available to them.  The crew members aren't a huge deal and they can all be unlocked with rep anyway.  So I don't feel like I am learning anything new when I play on one character versus the other, and I am unlocking the same gear and upgrades I have already unlocked.  I certainly don't mind grinding both characters in warzones, but it just makes less sense to me in space."

You could start off very easy and see how it goes.  Add 30 minutes of LISS (low intensity steady state) cardio after your lifting.  Use a treadmill, elliptical, cycle or the Earth in this area called ""outside"" and do a walking pace to a very slow-jog as you see fit.  You want to get to the point you are breathing heavy, but could still talk with someone.  Up the time you are in LISS (30 to 35, then 45, then 60 minutes) or if you use a machine, the resistance setting if you don't want to spend more time.  Raising the resistance setting and time will increase cardiovascular stamina (strength and endurance, not just endurance).  To raise your VO2 max, utilize HIIT 1-2 times per week.

With all cardio: LISS, HIIT, circuit training, etc.... be sure to eat back what you burn on a bulk, or you will wind up maintaining or possibly cutting."

gantt5,battlefield_4,1390248153.0,"The Scout and SRR have a rate of fire difference of 50%, but the Scout still only shoots 60 RPM. Compare that to any other class of weapon. Pump actions fire ~100RPM and semiautos fire ~200RPM. Everything else is upwards of 300. The one-shot ability of snipers gives them a chance, but run into two (competent) people and you're dead.

I go aggressive far more often than I sit back because I find long-range sniping boring. I've never had any problem with any of the sniper's rate of fire up close. Not even the M98 or SRR. If I get in over my head, I just chuck a grenade and pull out my pistol or back off.

The hipfire on snipers is terrible. Compare their hipfire to other classes. Even the DMRs are better. Can you successfully hipfire them? Yes, people do it all the time. Should you rely on it? Hell no. Even with a Scout or 338 with a laser, I'd be more likely to attempt a quick-scope than hipfire at anything further than 5m, which is approximately the distance in the image you linked.

I understand that sometime you have to take a shot while on the move, but if you can stop for a split second to take the shot, you should. It makes no sense to not to take advantage of perfectly accurate shots. If you're at full health or close to it, you should be fine. If you're low, you shouldn't be peaking anyways."

I temporarily became a hypochondriac, went to the doc twice for ""my head is imploding"" reasons, got anxiety pills, which helped a lot, but didn't really make anything better. I couldn't sleep, everything seemed to hurt physically as well as emotionally, and I think I insisted to a few people that I was dying, too. (The anxiety pills helped a lot with that last thing.)

Hart's eyes moving on her, looking her from head to toe. Leaning back with realization, Beth is prosting. Cohle doesn't show that he thinks about it in way or another.

Hart showing signs of nervousness, being uncomfortable. Sitting there. Rubbing hes left thigh with hes hand. Tapping knee of right left with hes hand.

As Beth has left with Cohle, for vics things, Hart confront's Ma'am about girls age. How she isn't 18. Face doesn't say anger or frustration to me, but maybe contempt towards Ma'am. Towards what kind house she is running.

When confronting Ma'am more about it and how there is better places for Beth to live, to recover from uncle, he does it with frustration and slight anger about situation. When Ma'am confronts Hart about *owning pussy the way you thought you did* he seems to take mental step back and thinks about it, what was said.

As Hart leaves and *tips* Beth, to do something else, Ma'am look is almost like disbelief. She doesn't believe Beth would leave, do anything else in hers life than prost as Ma'am's girl.

&gt; It's the ONLY little girls show with an adult, male, fanbase

Well, I can agree there, but that and the fact that MLP *has* a large fanbase are related. It's pretty common knowledge that cartoons for little girls are bad at best and terrible at worst. Lauren Faust, the brain behind The Powerpuff Girls, didn't want to contribute to the trend when she started working on MLP's reboot. Her team put together a girls show that was specifically supposed to counter the notion that ""girls cartoons are terrible"". This is what led to the fanbase being the size that it is today, by my knowledge.  

&gt;Then why aren't we EVER having this conversation about Samurai Jack?  

Because most of the people browsing the internet are white, middle-class males, raised in a society that socially punishes men that display ""girly behavior"" like crying or having emotions and rewards men that display ""manly behavior"" like athleticism or coolness. That's my opinion on it, anyway. I don't have any references to cite or anything.  

&gt;No, no, no, stop right there. I don't give a fuck what you like.  

You've spent this entire debate going on and on about how you find the entire fanbase ""violently creepy"" and that you think that we all have genuine mental illnesses. You *totally* give a fuck about what other people like.  

&gt;It bothers me that my little girl can't have a MLP convention, because it would be filled with creepy men.  

You yourself said that Comicon has a kids day. I don't really know how that works, but shouldn't that be a solution right there? Or if you're talking about MLP cons in general, petition other MLP cons to have similar days, or areas that are only for children. Or start your own convention just for kids. But I'm not going to apologize or make excuse for people gathering at conventions about things they enjoy. That is *literally* the point of a convention.  

&gt;Be honest, for once in your life, and tell me, would you take a 5yr old to hang out with THOSE people? Really? Honestly?  

Calling me a liar? And *I'm* the one that supposedly acts like a child. However, to answer the question, I don't know those people, so I wouldn't take a five year old to hang out with them. That isn't exclusive to the people in the picture though. I wouldn't take a five year old to hang out with *anyone* I didn't know (and preferably trust).  

&gt;Those people show up when we try to get comics signed. Those people are in line when we're buying comics and toys. She competes with those people for Christmas presents. Those sad, creepy, 20-something fucks that can't just leave her fanbase alone.  

It's not *her* fanbase. It's simply a fanbase, belonging to no one but the fans.  

&gt;I'm not. There are bronies, and there is everyone else.  

There are bronies, there are people that don't like bronies, there are people that don't like the show but like bronies, there are people that like the show but don't like the stigma of the term ""brony"", there are people that don't care, there are people that don't know about the show/fanbase, etc. There is a wide spectrum here, so quit oversimplifying to make it Us vs Them.  

&gt;This isn't me saying 'Everyone likes peanut butter'. It's factually true that most comic and cartoon fans are creeped out by bronies. Evidence of this can be found everywhere. It's laughable that you would argue to the contrary. Bronies are an incredibly hated minority in comics and cartoons.  

[Citation needed]  

Aaaand at this point I'm tired of typing out these long responses. I highly doubt anything I could say could change your mind anyway, as you seem pretty bound and determined to believe that all adult MLP fans are mentally-deranged creepers and that everyone who isn't a brony also thinks that. Feel free to respond to anything in this comment, just don't expect several pages of response."

Sit on the toilet. (Poop and wipe first if necessary.)

Fill sink or big bowl with warm water.

Stick bulb and tip completely under water, squeeze as much air out of bulb as possible, then let it fill with water.

Rub a little Vaseline or lube on nozzle, and insert gently into bum.

Squeeze as much water as you can from the bulb, clench your sphincter, and remove nozzle.

Expel into toilet.

Repeat until the liquid you expel is clear enough to satisfy.

Hop in shower for a quick wash. (Jump up and down a bit to help any extra liquid come out. I know it sounds stupid but trust me on this.)

If you Google ""anal douching,"" you'll get lots of tutorials. But it's really easy to figure out--the idea is to shoot water up your butt to flush it out.

RestlessBrowSyndrome,relationships,1390248346.0,"Testing is fine.  I have found more success texting than calling.  In fact, I do not call AT ALL.

So you may think, wouldn't texts be worse or further removed?  The thing is (and I know its cheesy) use emotes.  It works, and there is some limited info on this (I think through OKCupid and some other dating site).

I would say the biggest thing is that you should make plans immediately.  When I talk up a stranger I make plans right then.  Texting is just to confirm that nothing has come up right before the time of those plans.  I try to text very little unless the girl in question is a heavy texter.

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY:  Life does not suck.  Keep it up and you'll do fine.  Dating comes with a lot of rejections inbetween the good times.  You just get used to it.  Instead be happy that you got some girls number, a lot of people never get over their fear of approaching others."

It's insane how much he improved just in general though - he's much stronger on the puck, he's faster, his stickhandling is unreal, his vision has improved tremendously, and along with his vision, he can also make the difficult pass consistently where last year, he'd try to whip it across the ice and end up turning it over most of the time.

Obviously you expect guys to improve after their rookie season, especially if they get to work in the offseason with guys like Teemu and Mikko (and probably Saku?), but his improvement has been so drastic that it seems uncanny."

rockspeak,weddingplanning,1390248428.0,"I think the family-to-friend ratio has everything to do with the couple.  Most of the weddings I've been to were majority family (AKA over 50% family).  I think ours will be the first one that's mostly friends (about 75% of the invite list is friends).  

My fiance has a small family, and mine is tiny (lots of deaths).  We're also super social people, so on the friend side we've had a different issue:  Inviting person X without person Y would be rude, but person Y also has a SO, so now 1 invite has turned into 3-4, depending on if person X has a SO by the time of the wedding.  It's bonkers how quickly a guest list will balloon when you're trying to be politically correct.  We had to draw the line somewhere, and I'm sure someone will be offended, but our venue only holds so many!

Are you having a destination wedding?  Sending invites out with 5 months to go seems far, and people may not know what they're doing in 5 months.  

If you're feeling alone with the planning, why not ask some of the large family of yours for help?!  Some people just LOVE weddings, so they may be super helpful for ideas and/or crafts."

paladine01,childfree,1390248432.0,"I was wearing a jockstrap for about two weeks. Sitting around and being stationary is fine at all stages. You really only notice the soreness when you move or walk someplace. I took pain pills for the first day or so, but they weren't required after that. I took some at night through the first three days to help sleep a little better. You can feel it constantly for the first few days, but it's very minor. It only bothered me when I was trying to sleep.

Expect to walk slowly for about a week. 

Even now after exactly a month there is still a **tiny** amount of soreness. If I nudge my balls in the wrong way or my kid squeezes it accidentally I might feel a little tenderness. It doesn't hurt, it just makes me remember.

I first had sex after two weeks. Sex was fine, just no ball-play. Now my wife and I are trying to complete our required number of ejaculations so that we can be cleared. My doctor wants 20 - test - 20 - test and done, which is a crazy amount.

Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1390248433.0,"I felt that an extremely wide aspect ratio would allow me to link different elements (namely the village and the beasts on the far left) very loosely, allowing each one to hold its own story elements within relative isolation. If I had gone for a more standard width, I feel that it would have been unrealistic to have the villagers going about their day normally.

Then if you're comfortable with that, take a look at your calorie consumption. If you feel like it might be dangerous for you to get really into it though, take it slow, keep others involved or just don't do it.

ladycousland,dragonage,1390248468.0,"Agreed! While I adore Alistair in Origins and certainly appreciate that my human noble Warden got to have her happily-ever-after with him the semi-doomed relationship between Hawke and Anders is just so damned *romantic.* With his being Justice-infused, constantly agitating for an all-out mage rebellion and destined for a taint-induced early death, both he and Hawke know going into it that there isn't going to be a happy ending for them - but they choose to be together anyway. My Hawke was 100% supportive of Anders and his cause even at his most extreme and chose to go on the run with him after the events of Act 3.    

Of all the LI's in DAII he seems the most sincere in his love for Hawke and is genuinely appreciative (and a little bit surprised by) her unwavering support of him and his beliefs. The fact that he tries repeatedly to push Hawke away for her own good only makes him more attractive (which probably says more about me than the character, lol). Not gonna lie, I melt a little bit whenever he calls Hawke ""love."""

Nelerath8,AskMen,1390248487.0,"My last relationship fell to pieces actually because of the anxiety caused from a lack of common interests. We were both a bit of extremists in our hobbies, she an artist and me a gamer. She didn't enjoy gaming and I am mostly indifferent to art.

We got along over classes, dinners, and movies. So every time we hung out we'd lie on the couch and watch a movie, but as began to run out of movies we began to ask what we wanted to do and have no answer.

A lot of people would find me boring for it, but personally my hobbies (that can be done with a partner) don't extend beyond gaming and airsoft/paintball. Hers didn't extend beyond art.

Anxiety over having nothing more to do together combined with just not seeing each other as often (due to a lack of ideas) caused the eventual breakup.

Also I imagine someone is going to suggest it, we did try other things, nothing stuck.

There was an understanding she was permitted her work, so long as she could keep up with the house and my needs in a mostly consistent manner. If she couldn't she knew that I would bring in a second girl to help with all of that and  to live with us. It never did get that far, until she started suffering serious emotional/mental issues late in our relationship she did a damn good job generally.

I also encouraged her to volunteer at the local animal shelter (we both loved animals, especially cats), go hang out with friends, even go back to school. She would also often accompany me to business functions, social gatherings among co-workers etc. So far from a shut in.

What I call and train a slave to do, will NOT be what someone else does. Its like saying ""Well its a red car"". It could be one of a thousand brands of car in a thousand shades of red, yet they are all red cars.

Trolling is when you vocalize a  controversial but ultimately benign opinion that you don't actually believe which causes people to get in an uproar over the opinions.

As soon as you *actually hurt someone*, which this guy inarguably did, it's not trolling anymore. It's being a toxic pissant.

And please, don't just scoff and say ""Toughen up"" as if that excuses his behavior or calls the outrage into question. That emotionally-stunted asshole sent something calculated to hurt and offend a total stranger who didn't do a single thing to deserve it. It's like watching someone get sucker-punched on the street and telling them ""The real world isn't made to coddle you, just suck it up like an adult and accept that you're gonna get hurt sometimes.""

gonjow,short,1390248900.0,"well then, correct me if i'm wrong, but perhaps you just don't have much in the way of extended one-on-one experience with just talking to guys in general?  I take it you don't have any brothers, and your interactions with male friends you met through female friends have generally been with your female friends present kind of serving as a buffer.

I don't know you or what you look like so I can't tell you what's wrong, but just going off what you said I'm thinking it must be a body language or nervousness thing.  You are comfortable when your female friends are present but in a one-on-one interaction perhaps you don't exhibit the same comfortableness that you would otherwise and come off nervous and/or standoffish.  That is of course you are recapping the extent of your interactions without any bias.  

There's nothing wrong with making friends through friends but it is not the same as talking with people one on one which is what you seem to struggle with, with men.  it's funny the best advice for you might just be the cliche ""see them as people, don't put them on a pedestal"" which is funny cause you only see that advice given to guys.

If you're just waiting to be cold approached by some guy that is a huge mistake because men are discouraged from doing that in society now a days, just see any /askwomen thread about it.

That said, the situation I discussed, where farmers are essentially indentured servants, has little to do with Western capitalism. It is hard to blame that on the French or the war there. It is purely exploitative by their national and regional governments simply because they can. Vietnam being linked to Western capitalism is a specific class there. Most people get very little benefit from global trade. All you have to do is look one country to the north. China has a similarly strong single party, but their markets are far more open. 

If you look at even more closed off nations, like many in Africa, one of the main problems is the fact they are cut off from any type of financing. That is why I always recommend people utilize microlending sites like Kiva.org to help entrepreneurs grow their businesses in places where financing is nonexistent. For living standards to increase, I think a lack of capital is far more of a problem than having a strong link to Western banks."

Is sexuality fluid for some people? sure. Is it fluid for everyone? Absolutely not. Is it necessarily fluid for the person you're crushing on? Absolutely not. Even if this guy does break his lifelong pattern of exclusive attraction to other men, which is unlikely enough, there's no reason you'd be the one women that turns him on. I'm sorry if this seems harsh, but it's simply the truth. 99.99 percent of the time straight guys crushing on lesbians, lesbians crushing on straight girls, straight girls crushing on gay guys, and gay guys crushing on straight guys simply does not work out for anyone involved.

Besides, how would you feel if a guy or girl you weren't interested in dating continued to pursue you after you'd made it clear you weren't interested, said you were simply ""stubborn"" and ""naive"" for not wanting to be with them? I know I'd feel disrespected."

And again, you can't know that, since you admit that there is no evidence.

IAMTHEDEATHMACHINE,minnesotavikings,1390249212.0,"My $0.02:

* Ponder should be traded to a team who runs a read-option. He would be a decent backup in a system like that and we could get a late-round pick for him.

* Cassel needs to be retained. He's a great backup, an excellent mentor to young QBs, and he can start if we need him to.

* Freeman... I personally would like them to give him another chance. Norv Turner has got to be a *little* excited about a QB with an arm like that. And if he does indeed have attitude problems, let Zimmer adjust that! I just think that he has too much potential to just get rid of him, especially when he can probably be re-signed on the cheap. I know it's a stretch, but think about how great it would be to see Norv Turner polish that turd and allow us to forget about the QB situation for a decade or so. Kid has the tools, that's all I'm saying.

Give me Cassel, Freeman, and a 2nd/3rd round high-upside rookie heading into 2014. Obviously, if a better QB falls to us, we need to snatch him up, but I don't see any of the top-3 guys making it down to #8."

FFIXMaster,runescape,1390249222.0,"My old clan used to run an Iron Battle League every year, which was a lot of fun and something a lot of clan members looked forward to.

What we did was split the clan into teams by taking the four or five players with the highest combat level and assign them as Team Captains, and then have a team draft where they would take turns picking their team members, and then we'd run a round-robin tournament. 

We'd have two or three battles per week--however many we could fit into everybody's schedules-- and for the battles we'd march everybody in the clan up to the required level of wilderness on an f2p world and just battle it out between two teams at a time.  Rules were everybody had to wear an iron helm/body/legs but could use whatever weapon they wanted to.

This was all pre-EoC of course, so these days it would probably make more sense for Bronze/Imphide/Leather instead of Iron-all, but I think it could still work.  Having the teams be drafted meant they were usually pretty equal in combat level, since the high-levels would get picked up in the first round, the middle-levels in the second-through-fourth rounds, and the low-levels in the last round.  The number of captains we had varied each year, we tried to keep teams at about 4 or 5 players each, but it could pretty easily be scaled up or down for larger clans to use larger teams or smaller clans to use smaller teams.

I think about 99% of our clan was p2p, but we did the event on f2p for a few reasons, the first and most important of which was so nobody felt left out, the second was so there weren't any huge gaps in power level; it would suck if you had two members on your team using godswords and the rest were stuck using dragon scims, except that one guy who could only use rune.  A happy accident that turned up because we did it on f2p was old clan members who had ""quit"" playing RS would come back for IBL in the summer since they didn't have to buy back into p2p to participate."

She would introduce me to a lot of her classmates and stuff and we'd start to hang out with some of them.  The people she had made the best friends with were guys, which I didn't have too much of a problem with.  Most of them seemed cool. One of the guys she was probably the closest with and she started talking about this guy all the time.  He had just gotten married a couple months prior I guess.  I met him a couple times, and he seemed just seemed a hint of douchey, but whatever.  A couple weeks go by and she's just starting to act different.  Its our anniversary weekend and I have dinner plans for us, get a nice card, all that kind of stuff. She has to cancel on me last minute because she has to ""study.""  That weekend I stay at her apartment because I needed to do something downtown the next day and I was not living around there.  She had to go to her parents house for some reason.  She left her laptop and I took it to go on gmail.  Her gmail was logged in and I know I really shouldn't have done it, but I started to poke around just a little.  I felt terrible while doing it, but I could feel some distance between us and she wouldn't talk to me about whatever it was.  She had deleted the majority of her gchat conversations, but must have overlooked one of them.  It was a quite obscene convo with that married guy about what they had done that weekend and many other times before that.  So I took the card I had gotten her, wrote ""FUCK YOU"" over all the words telling her how I had loved her, and set it on her computer with that conversation still open, and left."

Linear programs are strength builders, at some point they require caloric surplus to continue progression.  Don't change it if you enjoy SL, just don't panic if you stall out earlier than expected.

Really; I would be telling a lie if I told you I knew exactly what happened.
This is where all relationships really are alike. She lost her job about a year before I released her and she moved out. I had seen this coming and told her to begin searching for a new job about 6 months before she was fired over bullshit. Of course she stuck her head in the sand and I thought it would be a good life lesson to see what happens when you don't listen to master. The money she earned was never an issue, it went to help paying for the food, bills etc but I was the bread winner so it really had no impact on our lives. She spent about 2-3 months looking for a new job but gave up. She was under-educated for her level of experience. I offered to send her back to school, full ride, she didn't want to go.

Around the time she stopped looking for a job, she seemed to be very distant. I believe under all of this she had some sort of emotional or mental problem but she refused to seek help or work on our faltering relationship.

In the end, the reason i released her is because she lied to me about a secret relationship she was carrying on with a female submissive where she was the dom(me). That and catching her several times on Skype with random men whom she lied about.

In an M/S relationship, like any, when trust is lost, its done. We were both youngish, no children, etc so I decided to call it off, release her, give her some traveling cash, paid for a mover and sent her back to her parents. "

topgirlaurora,todayilearned,1390249727.0,"Actually, there is a known reason that it reduces the chance of getting prostate cancer. It flushes out toxins, as discussed previously. Toxins that cause cancer. The prostate is a gland that needs to be emptied regularly. I'd like to share just one [article](http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=51013) on testosterone levels. Too much masturbation has been found to cause infertility and low testosterone. But occasional masturbation keeps the sexual system in good working order, just like working out the rest of the body. The same can be said for women. Kegel muscles get worked out by orgasm. So I conclude that masturbation is a viable, low risk option to horny teenagers of both sexes who would otherwise engage in sexual intercourse and risk STDS and pregnancy. And if that is an option, teenagers should be taught about all the options.

As a sex-positive person, I will be teaching my future children about masturbation as an option. And I brought up the EU as an example that masturbation can be given as an option in sex-ed."

Monosentence,summonerschool,1390249732.0,"Just a quick tip, if you hover over the little area for armor/magic resist in game, you can see how much the number you have gives you for resistance in a percentage.

(This is just an example, not accurate numbers) 210 Magic Resist may show you take 75% reduced magic damage. So if a spell, before any penetration on the caster comes into play, does 1000 damage- you'd only take 250. Scale things down mathematically, and if they did 100 damage and you took 40% less magic damage, they'd only do 60 damage.

See how that works?

One thing that helped me when starting was thinking of my lane opponent when building. ""Okay, if I start with x health + health off this item, that means I can take an extra hit more than they can, putting me at an advantage."" So you do the same with armor. ""If cloth armor let me reduce physical damage by 3%, then another will be a total of 6%. If their main damage skill is doing 100 to me, thats a total of 6 damage altogether that is mitigated before armor penetration makes an impact.""

Thats one reason armor seals are just so damn useful, even as a midlaner against an AP user. Melee and ranged attacks + minions can really hurt early on, so that extra 13 armor from seals can make a difference over time. 

For example, like in the jungle where you're always having three monsters (Except the Wight/Dragon/Baron holds, of course) smacking at you, being able to take 2 less damage from all three per hit by masteries, a few points less from armor seals, and a few points from any armor you buy, it adds up over time. So if you reduce like, 5 damage x 3 over a course of 10 seconds, assuming that the little ones are attacking kinda quick and the big one slowly, you may reduce upwards of 5x2x20 (2 attacks per second, for ten seconds), and 5x1x10 for the big guy. Again, these numbers aren't accurate but just a way of putting it into perspective. Those numbers could total out to quite a lot over time. Of course, we're ignoring that smite would be used to negate a lot of damage by simply killing the big guy faster too, but again this is for perspective- not mathematical accuracy.

You can probably find better comprehensive guides on Lolking and the like, I'd bet, but for now I hope putting this in an ELI5 sort of way helped you out.

Good luck out on the Fields. =3"

narf3684,summonerschool,1390249745.0,"Well, ults come in all shapes and sizes, so it's not a 'yes' or 'no' answer.

Lets first get to a good rule of thumb. Farming in lane with AA's is typically the best way to make sure you get every last CS. However, sometimes you want to use abilities to catch cs if more than one are about to die, or if you need to push a lane quickly.

Now, using an ultimate for pushing is a conditional thing. Obviously you are not going to want to use Rumbles ultimate to farm minions. It doesn't do that much damage to minions, has a relatively long CD, and is much better used on champions.

However, using an ultimate like ezreal's or lux's for pushing a wave isn't a bad use. Their cooldown is low and the range means you can push waves from far away. Also, those ults are not game changing in a teamfight, so having it down for a fight isn't going to cost your team in the long run.

tl;dr It depends on what uses the ultimate could bring. If it's a short CD and not a game changing ult on champions, then it could be ok. There is no hard and fast rule about using them to farm or not, judgement is key."

wraith313,MorbidReality,1390249855.0,"I think if she had taken it to police and/or a private investigator and/or her local district attorney office, I believe they may have taken some action (watching the teacher, something). Had she taken it directly to the school board, the teacher may have been fired.

What I am really saying is: by recording the convo you have tipped off the perpetrator that you have evidence and/or are trying to collect evidence. This would be akin to calling up a murder suspect and saying ""hey, I have circumstantial evidence and I am looking for more, so be on your best behavior because we are watching"".

Not *wrong*, but still *maybe* not the best way to do things. If I was a DA and I saw someone do this rather than try another law enforcement channel, I would immediately assume a few things: she is trying to get a lot of attention, she is trying to get vigilante justice, she is making unproven accusations at another citizen.

I realize that ""trying to get a lot of attention"" is exactly what most rape victims are afraid people will think, but you have to look at this from a law enforcement perspective. Doing something like this is trying to get justice outside the bounds of the law. The teacher may have admitted something on the phone, but you have to also remember: Was that really the teacher? Was that someone she payed to act like the teacher on the other end of the phone to get public sympathy? Who knows. That's the point. Since she did this all on her own it opens the door up to both civil penalties for the rape victim and, in addition, probably destroys any chance anybody had of making a real case.

Perhaps the police were investigating the teacher after this victim came forward already. And the teacher didn't suspect a thing. And they were building a case. All of a sudden she does this, the teacher suddenly is on constant guard and is cleaning up any remaining evidence. *This* is why it was a bad idea to do this.

Do I think the teacher should be held accountable? Yeah, if she actually did anything. But there isn't any evidence. No physical evidence. Nothing. All we have is this tape and someones memory *from a decade or more later*. So you have to think about that. And on top of that *what if she really didn't do it*. There are a lot of cases where people admit to things they didn't do. That is why we require evidence to convict.

Edit: I really hope I don't come across like I am victim blaming or something. I'm really not. I think this is a shitty situation but I can see if from both sides."

Him connecting the dots is his idea of a plot, sometimes it works, sometimes you realize you've done this before in a past Cage game and most times you realize how little sense the plot devices make.


You can literally see the exact moment the Fahrenheit plot falls apart and just commits suicide, its the same in Beyond Two Souls. Everything is fine up until the PASSAGE shit is introduced and all that Doom nonsense. Beyond Two Souls was a good game, if you can even call it that. It was just a very limited version of the whole interactive game idea and it felt like a massive cut scene. Beyond Two Souls definitely had its ""Wait, didn't this happen in Heavy Rain or Fahrenheit?"". If it wasn't that then you were questioning the point of anything in the game.

I guess his worlds are great, the lore and all that but the games themselves on an average are more shit than good. Its not a circlejerk if his games have legitimate issues in both the plot and the game mechanics. His plots are really, really fucking bad and that's pretty much the point when it comes to his games. Some how he managed to regress in terms of controls as time moves on, Beyond Two Souls had fucking terrible controls compared to Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain was in between shit and not so shit.

I've been watching this T.V. show on netflix called Lillehammer. Have you ever seen it? It's actually quite interesting. Aside from the plot, it has really piqued my interested in learning how to speak Norwegian. I've got some general knowledge of how to speak French, though that isn't exactly the language I can picture myself speaking as a second language the rest of my life. Oh, Highschool credits.  
  
I feel like I wasted so many of them. I would love to go back... at least take the classes I wished I had paid more attention to. Free school, man. But, aside...  
  
Call me cooky, but I sometimes wonder if my norwegian ancestry (or, dare I say it, a past life in Norway) has influenced my current interests. I listen to the Norwegian language being spoken in everyday tongue and I feel like I understand it deep down, even though I'm not fully aware in the front of my mind. I see the landscapes, the lifestyles, and I seriously feel like I have *been* there. In it all, submerged in the comfort of home. It's hard to explain, or maybe I just say that because I don't want to get too detailed and *really* let people analyze me. It's a defense thing... and I think it's truly ruining who I am, or at least, how I allow myself to perceive who I am.  
  
Maybe that's why. Learning a new language... it just gives me that backup escape. That failsafe reminding you that you have *some* stepping stone if you decide to go off track. Take a detour.

Quite frankly, it really doesn't matter IMO what excuse you give her, because like I said, it's your house! You pay the bills, you make the rules.

Also, nogoodones, in addition to TheHotness' question, did you play AC1? TheHotness isn't the only who got bored of it, but I loved despite the repetitive gameplay because I loved the characters, dialogue, and atmosphere. Also, the PC version adds a view optional missions that make it a bit more varied. And I lvoed the open-endedness of it that allowed me to scout out the area of each assassination and plan my approach, attack, and escape. I think only AC4 has started effectively recapturing the open-endedness, but in other ways.


I could go on and on about my opinions of each game but I think Brotherhood added to gameplay but suffered too greatly in plot; Revelations had a good but short/sparse plot and gameplay that didn't blend together well; and AC3 revitalized the series in a few ways but was too easy. So far AC4 has really interesting characters, lots and lots of variety, and a proper amount of challenge IMO."

It is the largest facilitator of the Foreign Exchange currency trade and leads in many other areas. If it starts to fail you better believe Germany will try to bail it out. 

Many argue the main reason Northern European countries were so adamant about preventing a Greek default was because their banks were so heavily exposed to toxic Southern European debt. This argument holds quite a bit of water considering one of the the main reasons France was downgraded from AAA was its banks' exposure to Southern European debt, and the likelihood public funds would be used to support its banking system. In fact much of the money used to bail out Greece and other nations have found its way to Northern European banks in the form of debt payments. 

People tend to forget 5 of the 10 largest banks are European. They are only getting larger after the ""one passport"" banking system implemented by the EU. 62% of all banking mergers and acquisitions take place in the EU, not in a developing market where you'd expect.  

All that said, its easy to say they are getting what they deserve. But these European behemoths are over 4 times the size of Lehman Brothers, and we all saw the damage that caused when it was allowed to fail. If there was a European banking crisis that threatened these massive entities, it would be naive to think their national governments wouldnt step in.

[Prends un cours de pr√©pa de premi√®re ann√©e](http://prepas.lavoisier.fr/pdf/programme-MPSI.pdf) (Maths Sup.)

√áa peut para√Ætre un peu violent, mais √ßa a l'avantage de tout bien d√©finir depuis le d√©but (Ce qui fera plaisir √† Bourbaki...)

Tu r√©√©cris tout correctement, ta somme infinie redevient une simple limite.

Puis, tu reviens √† la d√©finition d'une limite.

Bon, donc l√† tu as une d√©finition d'une limite d'une suite...

Tu auras alors un truc du genre, S_n converge vers lambda si et seulement si ""Pour tout theta r√©el strictement positif, il existe un N tel que pour tout entier n sup√©rieur √† N, |S_n - lambda| &lt; theta""

Du coup, si c'est vrai pour tout theta, c'est en particulier vrai pour 0.1.

On a alors l'existence de N_0.1 tel que pour tout n &gt; N_0.1, on a 
-0.1 &lt; lambda - U_n &lt; 0.1.

Du coup, on choisi un m &gt; N_0.1 (impair parce que √ßa m'arrange...)  :

-0.1 &lt; lambda - U_(m) &lt; 0.1

et

 -0.1 &lt; lambda -(U_(m+1)) &lt; 0.1

La deuxi√®me ligne revient √† dire :

-0.1 &lt; lambda -(U_m + (-1)^(m+1)) &lt; 0.1

Soit -0.1 &lt; lambda -(U_m + 1) &lt; 0.1

On multiplie tout √ßa par -1 :

0.1 &gt; -lambda + U_m +1 &gt; -0.1

Or on a aussi : -0.1 &lt; lambda - U_m &lt; 0.1

On somme tout √ßa et on obtient :

-0.2 &lt; 1 &lt; 0.2

Du coup, notre hypoth√®se de d√©part est fausse (La convergence de la limite...)

CQFD

Je suis s√ªr que l'on peut trouver plus simple, mais √ßa me semble un raisonnement juste...

Si tu veux je te le refous sur un bout de papier et je te le scanne, ce sera peut-√™tre moins moche."

She chimed in with ""What you're going to do is get rid of that phone and switch to {her phone company}, and you're going to get a basic phone without all those silly cameras and things. You don't need it, and you're not having it.""

I tried to explain to her how hard I worked for this phone and how it was a reward for myself for the long hours I pulled (I was working two jobs at the time), but I only got a few words in before she cut me off with ""No! **What. You're. Going. To. Do.** is get a basic phone and switch to {her company}. You are going to do that. You don't have a choice in this!"" Rinse and repeat until I gave up on the conversation.

Exis007,relationships,1390251003.0,"Welp, I think I found the problem. 

The stakes are SO HIGH there's no way for anything to work. No relationships work when the stakes are this high so early. 

First, very rarely do strangers date. Almost everyone starts off as ""friends"" and in order to date anyone, you have to be willing to ruin the friendship. That's the price you pay to spin the wheel. So I don't get what you meant when you said you liked her but you held off. The time for holding off has passed....you gotta get in there. 

You seem so down on yourself in this post because you were wrong and I'm confused about that too. You weren't wrong. You did connect. You were close. It was just not a romantic kind of close. And, frankly, there's NO WAY to know whether a friendly close is going to maybe be a romantic close unless you do the crazy thing and say something. You weren't wrong or anything, just unlucky in this particular instance. 

You say you ruined the friendship.....how, exactly? She doesn't sound pissed at you. You didn't stalk her or do anything creepy. You are hurt and sad, that's normal, but it sounds like she's cool with you. You're not a fool for liking a girl. You are incredibly normal. All of this is fine and her not liking you has nothing to do with your virginity or anything else. It just wasn't what romantic for her. That's all. It'll be a little awkward for awhile and then it won't be and it'll all be okay. This isn't a crisis. 

How do you face her? Well, you try to be as normal as possible...that's it. It'll be forgotten about very intentionally. She's not going to humiliate you with it. You'll do the thing millions of people do and you just don't mention it anymore. That hurts, I know. It is going to hurt. But it'll hurt less and less and the more non-awkward encounters you have, the less it'll bug you. It gets better with time, son. 

But there's a serious up-side to all of this. Now you know. Now you know and you can move on from her. Now you know that love hasn't forsaken you completely and you can put more effort in to that aspect of your life. Now you know that waiting months/years to make the move is REALLY painful. There's a reason people do those romantic moves early because the stakes are lower then. You haven't put all the chips on one number in the roulette wheel of love. Sometimes people wait and wait and they get closer and closer with someone and by the time they get around to the romantic move it's life and death. The reason people date is that they make that move early and THEN get to know that person over time. So that if it turns out things weren't meant to be or you don't have much in common you're not so emotionally invested that you're crushed. 

What I am trying to say is that everyone goes through this little cycle about a thousand times. You meet someone, you like them, you put yourself out there romantically, and then you see what happens. Over and over and over again. But if you do that with low stakes, when things are new and your whole self-image isn't on the table, you don't get stomped on emotionally. But there's nothing **wrong** with you for waiting as long as you did....that's just inexperience. You have to do it wrong a few times to learn NOT to do that. Your lesson came later in life but we ALL did it wrong once or twice (or a lot more than that). 

More importantly, you get BETTER at hearing 'no' over time. You realize that no  one is making fun of you and that you did nothing shameful. You learn to maneuver that awkward time that comes after without wanting to curl into a little ball. You realize that just because you put yourself out there, that you put your wants and needs out on the table, that doesn't mean you ruined anything with that person. You change things, you don't ruin them (unless you don't hear 'no' and you go into stalker mode or something crazy like that). This is all so totally normal, so completely regular, it is just new for YOU. MILLIONS of people did the exact same thing you did this week alone. They are also feeling dumb and maybe hurting a little. But it goes away, it gets better, you lick your wounds, and you try again. The elation that comes with the 'yes' is paid for with the cringe-worthy 'no' interludes. 

You kept yourself on the dating-sidelines for a long time but that doesn't exempt you from going through the same shit we all went through. You may be starting later, but you'll catch up. Best of luck and stop beating yourself up over this. It isn't the crushing defeat you think it is, but the discomfort that comes along with growing and changing. This could end up being super great for you if you let this be the worst it gets. Learn from it, move on, and recognize that there is a love-life for you out there somewhere.

By morning time, the only one he didn't get was the birthday girl! The guy was a 7'1"" stud. I could see many occasions of him having his way with a group of women. Think about it. He played basketball for a living and traveled from city to city for, what, 9 months out of the year? He often talked about the various women he had lined up in different cities. While I don't think he put much actual thought into the 20K claim and probably just threw a number out there, I wouldn't bet against him.

Edit: According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_life_of_Wilt_Chamberlain

&gt;According to Rod Roddewig, a contemporary of Wilt's, the 20,000 number was created when he and Chamberlain were staying in Chamberlain's penthouse in Honolulu during the mid-eighties. He and Chamberlain stayed at the penthouse for 10 days, over the course of which he recorded everything on his Daytimer. For every time Chamberlain went to bed with a different girl he put a check in his daytimer. After those 10 days there were 23 checks in the book, which would be rate of 2.3 women per day. He divided that number in half, to be conservative and to correct for degrees of variation. He then multiplied that number by the number of days he had been alive at the time minus 15 years. That was how the 20,000 number came into existence.

Ok, so he actually put some thought into this!"

That said, their hired musical coach who is an excessively talented guitar player is of the thought and experience, for himself, that he plays what he loves and doesn't care if anyone else likes it or it is commercially marketable. The band also lost a member a year ago because he wanted to be the drummer instead of the bass player and play drums from his soul. 

Anyway, long story short after talking to lots of people across the industry and lots of talented folks.

My thinking is that if you want to pursue commercial success then that , at this time in the industry, requires a lot of compromise/""selling out"". However, you don't have to do that if you aren't pursuing that direction. But, if you seek the success then go for it to make that happen WHILE maintaining time to enjoy/create/play what feeds your soul too. "
yourpants,WritingPrompts,1390251207.0,"You know how they say your life flashes before your eyes the moment prior to your death? Well, it's true in a sense, but it's not like how they portray it in movies and other fiction. It's more like an extremely excruciating and nostalgic conversation with Death over your favorite meal. The taste in the air of the room was so bittersweet, every word a breath of garlic and chocolate. What is this?

At this point in time, I wasn't about to die, but I was dead in that I had an estimated termination date. That's not something you ever expect to hear, and you can put it as simply or as softly as you want, but there's no easy way to relay that information to anyone.

""You've tested positive, sir. You have approximately 6 months to 1 year. I'm sorry.""

You're sorry? You're SORRY? What the fuck for?! This isn't your fault, it's mine! That fucking whore, I should have never married her. I knew this would bite me in the ass, but I didn't expect it to hurt like this. Divorce is one thing but a draft to the afterlife...that's something else.

But I suppose that's in the past now. That's all I have to look at now, right? Not only am I on death row, my future is gone too. No more retirement home, no more moon trip, no more family...fuck. No more family...

How will I tell them? They never took bad news well. Though, it's amazing that I'm more worried about their reaction than mine. I don't know how I feel about this. Ambivalent, maybe? Maybe. I just never thought I'd meet this day with such an unforgiving forewarning.

""Sir?""

The wallpaper in this room is awful. He should really get it painted. I wonder how many people have sat in this chair hearing this news and thought ""My, my, this decor is so tacky. A touch here and there wouldn't hurt."" I'm fucked up. I probably deserve this.

""Sir, are you alright?""

Oh, shit. Right. HIV. Almost forgot.

""...sorry?""

""Your results are positive, sir. I'm afraid there's not much we can do.""

Yeah, like you care. You have to confess this bullshit all the time, I bet it's so easy for you, not having HIV.

Jesus Christ, 2 minutes before this I didn't have it in my perception. I was fine. Now I don't know how to react. What the fuck do I even say? Thank you? Fuck you? Who are you? I've never felt so blank and directionless. I kind of want to die.

""...I see.""

Come on, man. You can muster more than that.

""...""

Never mind, guess I can't. Not that words will alleviate the situation anyhow.

Wait, I think this will make sense.

""...can I be alone? Please?""

""Of course, sir. I'll be right outside.""

The second the doctor closed the door behind him, the silence of that room was so clear. Words like the ones he spoke are supposed to spark discussion, not end it. I would never be able to speak again come next year. Everything I've ever thought or expressed will become meaningless. My entire life has been for nothing.

And then I cried. I cried and sobbed and wept harder than I ever have in my life. Harder than my mother's funeral; harder than my marriage proposal; harder than any of my nervous breakdowns; harder than anything. Those tears meant nothing. And neither do these.

...so what's the point? Why sit here dehydrating myself when I could go out there and do the things I've always dreaded? People say ""you're going to die anyway"" when it comes to trying new, exciting and dangerous things, but no one actually expects you to die, they just say that. But now, with Death becoming my new best friend for better or for worse, I'm essentially free to do what I want. Something close to a retirement home, something near a moon trip, etc. Those wishes aren't held back by life's inhibitions anymore.

I stepped outside, thanked the doctor for the news, dealt with the common procedures, and went on my way. So it goes, eh?

___________________________________________________

This was awful. This took longer than I feel it should have and still didn't come out very well. Death is a weird topic because I haven't been in that situation or talked to anyone who has. This story feels vague and pointless to me, but at least I practiced, I guess."

wweezzee,TwoXChromosomes,1390251262.0,"&gt;The other person's 100k of debt might be a huge hurdle, but guess what? It's not your hurdle to jump.

I just don't see your reasoning about how your spouse or boyfriend being 100k in debt doesn't affect you. It may not be your hurdle to jump, but unless you really have almost separate lives, youre going to be cheering him on/helping him get over that hurdle. You're both gonna be working the hurdle. 

&gt;I think it's just as shallow to swear off someone for having student loan debt as it is to not date someone because they don't drive a luxury car.

I guess that is your opinion. I would probably never date someone with a tattoo. I would absolutely never date someone who goes to church. Choosing a lifestyle of being with someone who is able to keep up with (by contributing at least 40 - 50% of what you can also afford) isn't gold digging in my eyes. You aren't getting a checkbook with no work, you're getting someone who is willing to chip in 50%. Perhaps it is shallow, though. 

&gt;You just don't have a valid cause to place yourself in the ""I was in the right"" category as if what you did was all that different from what Anna Nicole Smith did. You don't have to feel bad, and you shouldn't, but you should be honest with yourself.

I don't know how what I said puts me in the same category as Anna. All I said is that I want my partner to be on the SAME financial footing as me. I don't have any debt, and I want my partner to be on the same page about that. Anna Nicole would not be pleased in my relationship. My boyfriend and I split everything 50/50 and the most extravagant gift that I was not expecting to reciprocate (like birthday, xmas, etc..) was a 30 dollar necklace, which the chain rusted from me wearing it in the shower (I never take it off), so I replaced the chain myself. However, if I am a gold digger, then so be it. I'm happy.

* AC5 is a middle of the road thermal compound, Noctua's compound has about the same thermal performance, how ever doesn't settle and harden like AC5, easier to clean.

* EVGA's PSU's have performance issues, especially the 650G model you have selected. Grabbed you a better model.

* More reasonable motherboard.

* Added a 120gb SSD

* Changed the overpriced WD Black to a cheaper model

* Grabbed a much better GTX 780 model

* You may like the case, but it is WAY bigger than you really need and it would be impossible to fill all that space with this build. I saved you money and grabbed you a far superior case."

Iwannaliveonthemoon,TrueFilm,1390251470.0,"Street Zombies a.k.a. Ozone. The pinnacle of shitty films. The title of the movie is presented as a spin in over the exploding head of a junkie who takes some evil drugs, two people turn into shit demons and have sex for no reason, there's an underground fighting ring with racist overtones where two black guys fight with cardboard buzzsaws on sticks, and they make a metal clanging sound when the sticks hit together, not even the blade part.

The plot makes little sense, a woman births a spawn of Satan which is never addressed, a man gets his whole arm lopped off with a shard of glass, and **the guy on the cover of the dvd is not in the movie**, at all.

mousemaker,weightroom,1390251500.0,"1. Could be. But if you're on a cut don't worry about it, as long as you're still lifting heavy you shouldn't lose much muscle/strength. If gaining strength is more important to you, eat more.

2. Yes. 230 lbs. for the squat isn't that high of a number, but because SL progresses so quickly it's normal to have stalls once in awhile. Just try again next time. (Also, have someone check your form.) 145 is a pretty good number for your first stall on OHP. Almost everybody stalls on OHP first, before any of the other lifts.

3. Belts are a crutch at this point. Once you start squatting 400 lbs. or deadlifting 450 lbs. you should be using one (1.5x and 2x bodyweight respectively.)

4. Set the pins as high as you can. If you hit them on your warm-up reps, move them down a notch."

Yeah, they should have apologized for the delay in the official support ticket you submitted, but it's not like they were nasty in response either, just brusque.

10thMuse,AustralianCattleDog,1390251537.0,"I'd probably hold off on the dog park (unless it's empty like the above poster said) till your dog is a little more comfortable.  Our ACD is very submissive and can get easily scared by other dogs.  After having a bad experience at a more crowded dog park (she randomly got bit by a dog she wasn't even interacting with), we've been easing her into a new, smaller dog park by our house.  It's mostly empty, so we've gotten her used to going there to play fetch. For awhile I'd leave if anyone else showed up, but let her meet the other dogs on the way out.  Slowly, we found a couple other dogs that she gets along with and if they're there she's allowed to stay &amp; play.  

It took us a really long time to 1)get her really good at following commands like ""come"" and ""leave it"" while around other dogs and 2)be able to recognize what sorts of dogs &amp; situations she's comfortable with.  There are certain types of dogs she doesn't like.... we call them ""floppy"" dogs, those super playful pups that jump all around and are really extroverted.  Our dingo is just more serious and if there are those sorts of dogs she doesn't do well.  With more submissive or calm dogs she's fine."

That effort isn't deception, it's presentation. You're *showing* what kind of a person you are.It's the same thing with fitness and appearance. Your outward appearance is an expression of your personality, so by being fit, you are both showing people (an aspect of) who you are, and reinforcing to yourself that you're a strong person.

waywardrebecca,infj,1390251601.0,"My long-distance SO and I are both INFJ's, and for us I would say that one of the most important things is communication. Skype calls and talking on the phone periodically are definitely really important, but just sharing how we feel about things is something that often warrants even more effort. We both have a tendency to be insecure occasionally, and it's hard (if not impossible) when you're not actually with someone to recognize that if they don't actually say something about it. At first we'd both kind of bottle it up to avoid sounding needy, but then the insecurity would spiral into a bigger thing and cause more negative feelings than it should have. Beyond insecurities, same thing goes for if one of you is feeling upset or depressed or something. I read something about LDR's a while ago that kind of stuck with me- if you're with your SO in person, they will likely (hopefully) be able to tell when you're really upset about something and not come home and start cracking jokes or whatnot, but in an LDR if one person is upset but doesn't say anything about it, their SO might behave in a manner that isn't exactly appropriate for how they're feeling and that can create some bad feelings. When I read it, it was phrased much more cleverly than that but I can't remember exactly so I hope that still makes some sense, haha. 

So long story short, we've found that it's important to really talk about everything and not hide thoughts or feelings in an effort to make yourself look better or anything silly like that. 

LDR's are definitely tough, but they can be exceptionally rewarding. (I never planned on being in an LDR either, but sometimes someone comes along that makes it all worth it, and that's awesome!) It's important to remember that any relationship takes effort. Best of luck with your relationship! :)"

The66Ripper,AskMen,1390251601.0,"I hug just about everyone I know. I even hug my barber. It's a way of saying ""Hi, I appreciate you, and I am glad to see you.""

I think they're appropriate at just about anything but a work/business party. With business acquaintances a firm handshake is the way to go unless you know the person outside of work well enough to hug them.  

As a tall guy (6'6) it's really hard to get nice hugs back, and when someone 6'2+ gives me a hug it's really fucking nice. However, most of the girls I know love to get hugs from me because of how big I am. 

Either way, if you pass up on hugs and you don't have a phobia about germs or something, you're missing out. There's not much in this world that is free that makes people feel as nice and appreciated as a warm welcoming hug. "

Every single thread on Japan that hits this subreddit, regardless of context, will always have a reference to Yasukuni, Nanking, Bataan, Pearl Harbor, etc. Even if the subject matter is completely different. If you try to explain why the views in Japan are like that, you are called out as being a revisionist, in support of them, an apologist, etc. There is a BIG difference between trying to justify their views and explaining *why* someone thinks that way.

(Enter hypothetical land with new cast of characters)

The mind of a 12 year-old is a confusing place. 

Maybe a well-intentioned 12 year old misinterpreted someone's actions, and after decades of re-remembering the event(s) during puberty, while being exposed to the changing nature and increase of coverage of child abuse in media, as well as a family member with a vendetta who told her ""that pervert priest/teacher from years ago was always inappropriate with you!"" she came to honestly believe she was raped years ago.

Is it still libel/slander if she tells people she was raped? It would be almost impossible to convict her of slander, because its near impossible to prove that she *knew* what she said was a lie.  If I were a lawyer, I'd hope that she said something to a friend willing to testify, or stated her intent to lie/knowledge she was lying through electronic media.

The studios don't care about producing good content, they just want something people will watch. They don't care if the show is properly planned out from a story perspective. In fact they'd rather it wasn't planned out because then you can't get as much money from it. You'll always get the biggest return from shows that you run into the ground.

In 20 days the spider nest becomes level 3, then you go close enough to make it a spider queen. It hits the traps and dies. If not, you can just take it out yourself. Then just plant the new spider egg to start the cycle anew.

Basically this is just a way of having a spider nest next to your base without being constantly annoyed by spiders *(notice the bee, I guess that's one of his domesticated ones)*. This means the nest is constantly dropping spiders when they're generated.

The divorce system is too black and white.  For instance, if your wife cheats on you and you divorce her, that will have no impact on alimony payments.  You have to pay her every month to maintain her quality of life even though she is living with, and being ""supported by"" the man she left you for.  Divorce laws were good in the 1950's.

bombeater,OkCupid,1390252434.0,"We disagree on the definition of trolling. I believe that most people use the term incorrectly and much too generally. You could claim that it is pure hubris on my part to challenge the unstoppable juggernaut of common usage, and I wouldn't necessarily disagree, but I maintain that *actual* trolling is completely distinct from ""doing something stupid to elicit a reaction"". Proper trolling involves genuinely challenging someone's perspective, even if it's in a trivial sort of way, by exemplifying a behavior that *not only* elicits a specific predicted reaction, but is memorable to them in a way that plants the seeds of potential future understanding.

In other words, if it's flagrantly obvious to everyone that you're either A.) trolling or B.) a caustic douchebag, your'e not trolling successfully, because everyone is just going to discard what you're saying and focus on what an asshole you are.

Go ahead and call me stubborn or crazy, but I will cling to my esoteric definition of trolling until the day I die. In the immortal words of an important internet figurehead: Trolling is a art."
ShamelesslyPlugged,scifi,1390252435.0,"For me, Peter Hamilton is unique at crafting worlds and such. Hard to find thing that really compares. I have to admit, I started reading his stuff too young, and the first read of it gave me nightmares (the dead coming back freaked me out for some reason, and my imagination to took it unneeded heights). Went back, reread it, enjoyed it greatly.  

Simon Green's Deathstalker series has a lot of character, aliens, and is quite long. Haven't read it in a decade, but I enjoyed it. Hyper violent, very quirky.  

My favorite when it comes to quirky SciFi with interesting cultures and characters is Jack Vance. I'd start with his series The Demon Princes. It's old and probably out of print, but he was some of my gateway SciFi.  

Ian Bank's Culture books are mentioned all over the place because they're fantastic. The stories in them, though, are largely unrelated although prolific. Certainly there's a fair amount of quirkiness here.  

Some shorter series you might like are Scott Westerfeld's Risen Empire (different sort of transhumanism there) or Walter Jon William's Dread Empire's Fall (though this one is the furthest from what you're specifying and is more space Opera). Dan Simmon's Hyperion Cantos is worth mentnioning as is James SA Corey's Expanse series. Again, somewhat divergent from your specifications, but very good SciFi. Richard Morgan's Altered Carbon might also be up your alley, although for me it remains on the ""to read"" list. If you want to go full on Space Opera, that's another story."

You're girlfriend is cheating on you (because falling in love with another guy and making it clear to him she wants to be with him is emotional cheating) and she's fucking calling *you* selfish because you're not okay with this!? Is she insane!? She clearly gives 0 shits about your feelings because anyone with common sense would know what she's doing is wrong. 

&gt; She doesn't understand why I'd be unhappy in a poly relationship, because I tell her so much that I want her to be happy. She just doesn't understand why I want her to be exclusive to me, for lack of a better term, because if I consented to this I'd be making everyone happy.

Yeah, I want to do whatever is possible to make my boyfriend happy, but that doesn't mean I'm just going to be a doormat and allow him to do whatever he fucking wants. I'm not just going to cut off my arm or something to make him happy. She wants you to make her happy at *your* expense. Relationships don't work like that. 

She's okay with a poly relationship because she's going to be the one with the other relationship. She's going to be the one who gets all the attention and has two guys doting on her. What happens if she suddenly had to share her attention with another girl? I highly doubt she would enjoy that. 

At this point, even if she agreed to stop talking to him, I would dump her. You guys have different ideas on what is and what's not acceptable in a relationship. If she wants an open relationship that's one thing. However, the fact that she would much rather just string you along miserably instead of respecting your wish for monogamy and letting you go is terrible. She doesn't respect your feelings and instead wants to manipulate things so she gets what she wants. Poly relationships can be okay if both partners respect each other's feelings. She doesn't so it's never going to work out. "

mkvgtired,europe,1390252530.0,"He sounds a bit like a condescending prick. If he would have mentioned ""European ideals"" and left the US out of it its one thing, but he didn't. 

&gt;Take the list of things that many Europeans consider to be most characteristic of us - *by contrast with the United States*. (my emphasis added).

Strong welfare state, sure I can agree with that. Both European nations and Canada have stronger welfare states than the US. But that is where his arguments start to fall apart. 

He mentions the use of military force being a last resort. Canada is almost always part of any international action, along with the UK and France. If you look at NATO voting records, it does not take you long to realize Europe is not as pacifist as the author would have you believe. In fact it is very common for NATO members to vote for intervention and then not contribute to the cause they voted for. This was apparent in Libya. The US wanted to sit that conflict out, yet was pressured by the UK and France. European NATO members may look pacifist based on their actual military contributions, although their voting record shows they're not actually pacifist, but rather just a vote to expend other countries' military resources instead of their own. 

He talks about men and women being able to live with whomever they please. The gay rights movement was underway in the US and in Europe at the time of this writing. Today, based on laws that have passed, the same percentage of the US population and EU population, 42%, will be able to get a same sex marriage in 2014. Many more states and EU countries offer some type of same-sex union. 

""We pride ourselves on diversity"". Again if he only said Canadian and European values aligned here I would not take issue, but c'mon really? When talking about national values, saying priding oneself on diversity is in contrast with American values is absurd. The US consistently gets over 1 million legal immigrants annually and roughly 800,000 illegal immigrants. These people come from all over the world. Acting as if pride in a diverse populace is a European value *in contrast* with the US is laughable. 

Overall he makes some good points. But his holier than thou attitude is really off putting. Can anyone publish commentary on Europe without dragging the US into it? Canada shares similar values with Europe, those points could have been made without making unsubstantiated arguments about the US. "

austinanimal,AskReddit,1390252604.0,"So I started in the world of traditional graphic design back in the early 1990s. In fact, even the high school I went to was a magnet high school for the arts and sciences. I was learning Photoshop and Illustrator very early on. I believe I started on Photoshop 3.0 or maybe 2? Whatever it was, the first version I used didn't even have layers yet. After that I went to design school and the web was starting to blow up in the mid 1990s. I learned html in school and also traditional design and illustration. After that I worked at a technology company doing their design work, html and some css (infancy). They  basically did what RSS does now everyday, except back then, there wasn't really any RSS to speak of. They bought and repackaged news and financial data, skinned it and sold it. 

I wondered around doing web design and graphic design work for the next 12 years or so, while always teaching myself new things about design, UI design, and reading books about usability, testing, user experience and the like. 

I was out of work and got a call out of the blue from a director where I work.  He had found me because my portfolio was nice and had good SEO apparently. 

I came in for an interview and I thought I bombed it.  A week later I had an offer and here I am almost 3 years later. I read stuff all the time, a lot of smashing magazine, creativebloq, and also hang out on reddit, but a lot in the design and ui/ux subreddits to check out new stuff."

I personally was/am interested in a long-term relationship, but before I met my girlfriend I wouldn‚Äôt have turned down a more casual arrangement/encounter in the mean time (but that didn't end up happening). I ended up chatting with a handful of girls on Tinder, and usually the result was absolutely nothing. Either I wasn‚Äôt interested, or I was for whatever reason unable to move the interaction beyond Tinder, or texting via phone. Until I matched up with this one girl, and things just‚Ä¶ clicked. It started out just like most of my other Tinder interactions, we both took a liking to each other and moved over to texting, spoke on the phone once or twice, and then arranged a date. Our first date went wonderfully and the rest is history. 

The bottom line is that there are lots of normal people on Tinder and the interaction is kinda sorta like other forms of online dating. No harm in giving it a try.

You personally are under the jurisdiction of the courts and police of whatever area you are in right now, and the fact that you think you aren't, because you think you have some magic talisman or password that will allow you to behave with impunity, does not affect that.

Malazan is a difficult read in terms of being thrown in in the middle of the action with no knowledge of the world, which is quite foreign. Some people love it, some people hate it. And then, as you read, the world just keeps growing and growing. It's a long series that requires plenty of rereads, but is rewarding to those that love that kind of style.  

Abercrombie is trope bending on the classic Tolkien quest. It's not a super hard read, and a lot of fun.  

Martin is the popular guy right now. He makes a lot of fearless choices in his writing that I think pay off. The last few books haven't gripped me as much, but we'll see what kind of finale they were building toward.  

Glenn Cook's Black Company is kind of a must read if this is a genre for you. It's the granddaddy of this kind of writing, coming decades before these other authors.  

Bakker is actually probably the hardest to read of these. A lot of extreme sex and violence. Plus the guy happens to be a PhD in philosophy, so it creeps in and the writing can be dense for some. Personally, I love the crap out of it."

And we're having an early-bird special!

Normally, four full months would cost $100 for US customers and $140 for international. However, if you sign up before February 1st, I'm'a hook you up with a deal: **for the next 2 weeks, I‚Äôm offering 10% off to everyone who signs up for all 4 months TSP3:RotS.**

This round of subscriptions will use a DIFFERENT BASE for the yarn; rounds 1 and 2 were a 75/25 fingering weight blend of superwash merino and nylon, but Return of the Sheep is a 100% superwash merino worsted weight. It is super soft and springy and all I want to do is snuggle it :)

Within each shipment you will find:

* 100g (approximately 218 yards) of soft, durable, and machine-washable worsted weight yarn in 100% superwash merino wool.
* A peek into the process with dyers notes about how the cocktail‚Äôs ingredients translated into the colors used, as well as whatever misadventures occurred when I tested the inspirational cocktail.
* Learn an interesting new technique (such as fun cast-ons and edge finishes).
* Learn to make the signature cocktail yourself ‚Äì the recipe is right inside the yarn label!
* I am addicted to candy, and you should be, too. Allow me to enable you.

Yarn will be mailed out at the beginning of the month ‚Äì usually on the first, or on the first Monday should the month start on a Saturday or Sunday. Here‚Äôs the schedule:

March 3
Purple Blossom: juniper berry blue, shades of soft purple, and a hint of bright lime.

April 1
Grasshopper: deep mint green, softer bluish creme-de-menthe green, creamy white, and a hint of warm chocolate.

May 1
Fruit Tingle: a smooth gradient from deep blue to reddish purple.

June 2
Night Black: deep blue-black fading into twilight blue, apple green, and rich burgundy.

Subscription prices will go back to normal on February 1st, when the month-to-month option becomes available. Be sure to hop on board early ‚Äì there are only 20 spots per month, and they just keep going faster and faster.

**Spots remaining for TSP3:RotS**: 7

You can sign up via the blog [HERE](http://www.tipsysheepyarn.com/blog/?p=167) or at the website [HERE](http://tipsysheepyarn.com/shop/club.html).

The original 4 colorways of the Socktails line (Cosmopolitan, Mint Julep, White Russian, and Kir de Reddit) are available right now in the [shop](http://tipsysheepyarn.com/shop/socktails.html), and I will be adding the next 4 in early March/late February.

tek1024,technology,1390252816.0,"What an obscure, oddly painful reference!"
dakru,AskMen,1390252816.0,"&gt; This thread is blowing my mind, too ‚Äì all these people asking if it was really raped or talking about false rape claims (which are terrible, of course, and very rare, and not what the 0P described as happening).

False rape accusations happen significantly less often than actual rape, certainly, but it's not low enough to say that it's ""very rare"". The best numbers seem to be around 8-10%:

&gt; While most of the good studies converge at a rate of about 8 percent to 10 percent for false rape charges, the literature isn't quite definitive enough to stamp out the far higher estimates. And even if we go by the lower numbers, there's the question of interpretation. If one in 10 charges of rape is made up, is that a dangerously high rate or an acceptably low one? To put this in perspective, if we use the Bureau of Justice Statistics that show about 200,000 rapes in 2008, we could be looking at as many as 20,000 false accusations.

Breakfast_King,swtor,1390252835.0,"I think this is especially true in GSF.

There are times playing Civil War where it makes sense to be attacking when you already have two points.  If one of your points is obviously lost and they have abandoned their only node, attacking it can be a good call to punish them for overcommitting. 

In GSF, however, actively defending a node does more than just provide an extra body to slow down the enemy.  Even if you are outnumbered, you can fly circles around the satellite and hide from missiles to stall until reinforcements arrive.  You are also generating turrets which also need to be dealt with before they can cap.  One person can stall/prevent a cap a lot longer in space than on the ground.  You can't really hide anywhere on Civil War and can only stall so long before you get killed.  Plus it takes almost no time at all for reinforcements to arrive from other nodes and respawns, especially scouts.

Edit:  The inverse is true of Civil War too.  It is a lot easier for one person or a small group to cap a node when you already control two because there are no natural defenses.  Whereas turrets do a pretty good job slowing down a single attacker until it can be defended."

Your condescending and sophomoric tone have only steeled my resolve, and you have provided absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the ""only solution"" is to ""toughen up"".

""Don't feed the trolls"" is *sometimes* good advice, but it is completely irrelevant here. No one is continuing to engage with the person who sent OP that message. Ultimately, that guy *didn't care* whether he got a reaction or not because sending the message itself was completely effortless.

""Toughen up"" is a short-sighted solution devoid of realism and compassion. Humans are irrational creatures who rely on each other for emotional support and validation; to claim otherwise is to ignore obvious indications about human behavior. OP came to us for exactly those things: emotional support after being hurt (even in a trivial way), and validation that the asinine stranger's behavior was not socially condoned.

""Toughen up"" is condoning that person's behavior. ""Toughen up"" is saying that they did something acceptable. It's emotional. It's symbolic. ""Toughen up"" is rejecting OP's right to their own feelings, and simply put, it *just doesn't help*.

If you really want to help people in this situation without contributing to what you perceive to be a sugary sympathetic circlejerk, find a way to phrase what you're *actually* concerned about instead of just flippantly saying ""toughen up"" before scampering away."

But I have run in to enough women who don't want to shake hands to make me a little self-conscious about extending a hand. 

For a while I was pretty confused about whether I should be shaking people's hands or not; some guys will take my hand and grasp it in a strange way....like they will grasp my hand and turn it so my knuckles are facing up.  That's not something I'm used to, so it weirds me out.  I think a regular handshake is very safe to do, especially since it's unisex.

The HD+ has added the Play store, which gives Google input on the platform again, but it was launched without it.  The Kindle line is a complete Amazon-centric fork.

monster_woman,offmychest,1390253196.0,"You are going to have to find coping mechanisms to counter the panic attacks and other feelings that you are having. You can train yourself to deal with the panic attacks over time but it will take years to be perfectly honest. I do not know if you will be able to hide this from someone who lives with you. 

What I always did is take a bath to relax when I had a panic attack and I developed a strategy to talk myself down, which has worked for many situations besides panic attacks since then (over medication, or any other ""out of control"" feeling situation). Understand that this could take over an hour, which is why I am skeptical that you would be able to hide this behavior, but anyway...

You will have to present yourself with something logical that you can focus on as to why your feeling is not in touch with reality, and concentrate on that reason until you can accept that it is the truth about your situation. So, like, if I get paranoid, I would tell myself why that isn't true, and focus on the reasons why until it seemed reasonable to me.

You can also try meditating, which I don't do, but seems to work for others. Exercise is my big go-to, and I tend to run a lot, I will sometimes exercise until I am near exhausted and this also helps me to sleep. Other people will pick a role model, and try to copy that person's behavior as a way of having a coping mechanism, because copying behavior takes the strain away from having to make decisions entirely from your own experiences. It also helps you feel connected to others.

I hope that some of these tips might help you. These are things that I know for a fact work for me and I use them often. You can ask me more about them if you want to and I will try to answer as best I can. I wish you the best of luck."

If you enjoy pulpy, combat oriented SciFi, then you'll like it. Honestly, I like it. It also helps to be a 40k fan in advance, and at least know a little about the universe.  

u/Bonehunter stated Gaunt's Ghosts, which is generally considered to be some of the best of their books. For me, it's no. 2 and really got tiresome in some aspects as it dragged on. That's not to say that it wasn't a fun read all the way through. Abnett's Eisenhorn is also great, but slowly falls apart as the story moves on. First book is fantastic. I did not like Abnett's Ravenor.  

Sandy Mitchell's Ciaphis Cain books I think are the best the 40k writers have to offer. It's about a commissar (like the Russians, officers that enforce discipline by shooting troops that are likely to run or mutiny) who tries to avoid the frontlines as much as possible, which only results in him being thrust in the most dangerous bits of combat. Acceptably well written, face paced, and with a dry wit I enjoyed it a lot.  

Space Marines, like Jedi, largely don't make interesting characters to me. There's a lot of other stuff written that didn't do much for me. I didn't like the Ultramarines books.

The final day of the first stage. Evgeny (Genja), what are you first impressions of the venue and the current standings?

Genja: I like the new venue, it is very spacious and has a lot of utilities. The only downside is that the place is new, therefore it is not fully equipped. I think every team will have a full-fledged training schedule soon. For instance, today we were asked to leave while we were preparing for our game, therefore we weren't able to practice as much as we wanted to. I am sure that is is going to be changed in the future, so we will have more opportunities for practice. I like the place nevertheless. As for the standings, it was quite predictable that ourselves and Fnatic will be in the lead.

I believe that many didn't see Fnatic regaining their shape after their dissapointing performance at BotA and IEM Cologne. On the contrary, Alliance didn't live up to the hype and are doing quite poorly right now. What do you make of it?

Genja: As for Fnatic, even though they won over us by a landslide, I wouldn't say their shape is so good right now. It would be stupid for me to justify my actions, since my KDA was 0/5/0 or something like that, it was terrible. I didn't feel that their performance was too strong, even though they are currently on a three game win streak. I don't feel like it is impossible to oppose them and I'd rather say that we overcomplicated our game plan. Overall, it doesn't look like they are in a good shape.  Before I witnessed Alliance losing three games, I thought that they should have been a stronger team. I cannot really say why they are losing and what is it they are lacking, but they are losing. I thought they would perform better.

Let's return to your game versus Fnatic. You had a unsuccessful invade which resulted not only in your giving away first blood, but also getting into a disadvantageous position in your lane. You were denied from experience and CS. Was it possible for you to do something in order to catch up with them?

Genja: I think we could catch up with them up until Diamond came by, and afterwards there was nearly nothing we could do. If you don't remember, Diamond was ganking our lane but we ended up dying nevertheless and thus achieved nothing. Up until that point we weren't doing bad and had a chance to catch up with Fnatic, but after that gank I was so far behind that I couldn't do anything.

I was talking to Edward about his new champions like Amumu and Kennen. What's your take on using this kind of support champion?


Genja: I support it to some extent. To be honest, there are many possible support picks, therefore many old support picks are looking quite bad right now. Right now support champions should either deal a lot of damage or be tanky and have CC. There are many possibilities right now and I approve of it. The only downside is that at our scrims someone is occasionally overextending, but it might be for the better.


Don't you feel frustrated that junglers and supports received some benefits in the current patch? What benefits did AD carries get?


Genja: AD carries got nothing and things got even worse for them. I think AD caries are present just because that's the way the game is played. Right now midlaners are very strong. They farm a lot and if they start killing people, only a miracle can stop them. Junglers got buffed as well. They always have a higher level than marksmen and always have buffs. If they manage to get a kill, they will build items that will make them almost unkillable - only mid laners can kill them. AD carries are falling behind and can only achieve something only as the game goes on, provided that they got fed or their team is going well. I don't think that AD carries have to be removed. You must continue picking them, even though their relative strength was reduced.


Can it result with players going back to utility AD carries like Ashe and Varus? Or do you have to resume playing champions like Lucian and Jinx who are currently strong?


Genja: We will resume playing relevant champions who can do fine doing the laning phase. For instance, Ashe is really strong, but she has a weak laning phase. We could see her getting picked if she gets a buff. Even though Varus is picked less, you can easily play him. His only weakness are junglers. For instance, when you are level 4, level six VI can press r on you, and you wil die. Lucian can deal with it, since he has a dash. Some AD carries are pickde to survive the laning phase and to farm. If you manage to get 200 minions by the 20 minute mark, you can be considered a hero.


Do you see a solution to this problem? What can be done to increase the satisfaction from playing AD carry?


Genja: I don't really know. You can, for instance, change masteries. There is a mastery that increases your damage by 1.5%, but makes you receive 1.5% more damage as well. This is just great! I will level it up to die even faster! On the other hand, I still level it up, since you die from a light breeze anyway. There is no difference between taking 1 second or 1.1 seconds to die. There are many options, but you have to think it through. There are other people doing it, so why should I bother? I think that Marksmen deserve a buff.


The first game of the day is coming up, therefore let's move to the last part of this interview - time for shout-outs!


Genja: I would like to thank our sponsors for their continuous support. I would like to thank our fans for following us. Keep on watching our games and supporting us. It is pleasant to realize that you are dedicating your time and leaving cheerful messages for us. Thank you!


Thank you for watching this interview with Evegeny ""Genja"" Andryushin!"

You can use a number of resources to check things out: talk to your GP about different Gynos they know, and which ones specialize in what.  If she has a female doc, ask her to refer her to her doctor.  Next use internet resources like: ratemydoctor (needs to be taken with a grain of salt), and more established resources like: ratemds.com.  Local oriented news/media often publish lists of top doctors.  US news has one: http://health.usnews.com/doctors.  Find out who is getting published and winning awards in their field and see if any of them are near you: http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/News_Room/News_Releases/2013/Awards_Presented_at_the_61st_Annual_Clinical_Meeting
Talk to any nurses you know, or even run into what they think of the doctors.  They are such an important resource.  Be polite, and thank them for their work (they totally don't get thanked enough) and ask them for advice.  The stuff they know is incredible. Use docfinder (http://www.docboard.org/docfinder.html) to find out the standing of the doctor with your local medical board.  Bestdoctors.com is a site where doctors can review other doctors.  

Another thing you want to do is do as much research as possible on your own using credible websites.  I prefer resources like the Mayo Clinic over resources like WebMD.  When you go in armed with information you can tell your doctor that you are worried about a specific thing, or you'll be able to notice if they didn't ask questions you think they should have. 

Make the most of the appointments.  Go in ready with facts, an organized list of symptoms.  Ask questions.  Give the doc information before she asks for it or even if she doesn't.  Explain the effect this is having on your life and why it's very important to you to find a resolution - doctors are more motivated to work with patients that demonstrate a passion about their own health.  A good place to start your education is the American Association of Gynocologists and Obstricians. There have two resources I like here:http://www.acog.org/~/media/For%20Patients/faq020.pdf?dmc=1&amp;ts=20140120T1612119559    http://www.acog.org/~/media/For%20Patients/faq127.pdf?dmc=1&amp;ts=20140120T1612214813

Separately, something I forgot to mention is lube and cleanliness.  Obviously the female sex organs are sensitive - it means our highs are better than yours, but so are our lows more sucky.  As a result we got to be careful with what we put in there.  Even a low grade UTI can cause painful sex, so cleanliness is important.  Even without penetration pee after sex.  Clean only the outside areas like the labia, perineum, and anus with warm soap and water.  If you are using toys, fingers, peni, make sure that they aren't hang out where bacteria live (like the anus or general area) and then are going towards the vagina or urethra without getting cleaned first.  We don't want to spread that bacteria.  Vaginas themselves however, are self cleaning like eyeballs.  The inside parts DO NOT need soap, water, douches, anything like that.  There is good bacteria that keeps that shit clean and messing with it can cause problems. 

Lube, condoms, laundry detergent, underwear fabric and so on can all have an effect on the vagina and associated parts. Try different things to see what works, but as a general rule, I would say skip out on the drug store brands and go and treat yourself to some good lube.  Lube, even for outercourse and hand jobs is a beautiful tool.  Always use a little more than is enough. If you're using a condom then use a water-based lube.  But remember, not all lubes are created equal.  I like Hathor Aphrodesia because it is very simple, but still has staying power.  It's perfect for people with sensitive skin or who tend to have allergic reactions to things.  It's got no colouring, no perfumes, no parabens, and no petroleum.  And it's condom and toy safe! 

If you think condoms are having an effect try using some non-latex ones - polyurethane and polyisoprene condoms are available at most if not all drug stores. 

I hope that helps!"

I agree that changes of possession need to be looked at, and the booth guys should initiate a review whenever they feel it appropriate.  Change of possession seems like a good time.

The other problem is, if a ref makes the wrong call and whistles a play dead, you can't unwhistle it.  So the preference is to let the play continue and work it out at the end.  Otherwise you could have situations where someone recovers a fumble, but the play is whistled dead and they lose that opportunity."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390253700.0,"I don't think online dating is a horrible system itself, I think the problem is with people that are hyper judgmental.

I actually *love* online dating.  If someone answers a lot of questions and has a lot of info in their profile, then you can see if you'd be compatible at least to a certain extent without wasting time.  I'm not talking about their whole life story, I'm talking about just certain qualities/characteristics that actually *are* potential dealbreakers.  

Just as some examples...I'm allergic to cats - if someone has a cat, I'd ignore them, because it's a waste of time.  I could never go to their place.  If they are very religious, then I don't bother, because I just do not work well with someone that's too religious - friends, yes, absolutely, but a significant other?  Absolutely not.  

The good part is that you actually can be a bit picky when looking for someone.  Instead of saying ""well, you'll be good enough for now, we'll see what happens,"" you can say ""well, you look good enough, but I don't *want* good enough, I want potential for someone I want to stay with.""  Since there are so many more options, it's a lot easier to pass up an ""okay"" option in order to find someone better for you.

To me, online dating is finding someone that's compatible enough to not have any major dealbreakers.  You meet them to see how they are in real life and if you actually want to date them.  It's really just a screening process, it's not meant to choose the person of your dreams.  Just because people don't want to play along, doesn't mean the system is broken."

avantvernacular,FeMRADebates,1390253799.0,"Rather than try to fix all the problems at once, I'd like to focus in a solution to a specific problem that I think can be fixed relatively easily - criminal sentencing bias. 

Create a judicial oversight committee that annually audits each judge, to search for sentencing disparities. Any judge found to be giving harsher punishments to one group or another (beyond a reasonable margin of error) is disbarred.

Will this end jury bias, or police bias? No. Will it end arrest and charging discrimination? No.    Will it solve all of men's problems? No. It is a singular, specific solution for a singular, specific problem. 

&gt; Do you think this solution will negatively hurt women?

Yes. In order to keep their jobs, judges will no longer be able to give ultra soft sentences to women who committed crimes. No more 1 year in prison for [running an underage prostitute ring](http://www.columbian.com/news/2011/dec/29/low-sentence-for-wa-woman-who-pimped-minors/), no more 18 months probation for [raping a 12 year old](http://www.niagarafallsreporter.com/Stories/2013/Dec03/exnf.html), no more 5 years for [beating an infant to death](http://m.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/babysitter-sentenced-to-5-years-in-virginia-toddlers-death/2014/01/13/d1ffc554-7c8f-11e3-95c6-0a7aa80874bc_story.html)

&gt; Do you think this solution involves using strategies akin to socialism? 

No, I think that would be an erroneous conclusion. 

&gt; Do you think your solution is similar to a solution a feminist might have brought forward for women?

I can't think of any similar examples off the top of my head. 

&gt; If the MRM solves problems similar to how feminists solve problems, is it a good thing or a bad thing?

Depends on the solution. That probably should be evaluated individually. 

&gt; Do you think some of men's problems are rooted in biology?

This one isn't. 

&gt; Can feminism and the MRM co-exist?

If we had an answer to that, there would be no reason for this sub. 

Bonus side affects of judicial auditing:

* also works against racism too!

* reduces prison overcrowding. 

* combats corruption/bribery

Negative side affects:

* auditing committee needs to be paid. 

* lots of unemployed racist and/or sexist judges

* defense attorneys for white women actually have to work hard.

topgirlaurora,todayilearned,1390253918.0,"[Sex-positivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-positive_movement) is 

&gt; a social movement which promotes and embraces sexuality with few limits beyond an emphasis on safe sex and the importance of informed consent. Sex positivity is ""an attitude towards human sexuality that regards all consensual sexual activities as fundamentally healthy and pleasurable, and encourages sexual pleasure and experimentation. The sex-positive movement is a social and philosophical movement that advocates these attitudes. The sex-positive movement advocates sex education and safer sex as part of its campaign.""[1] The movement generally makes no moral distinctions among types of sexual activities, regarding these choices as matters of personal preference.

The reason I think that masturbation would reduce teen intercourse is not that it would reduce sex in committed or pseudo-committed relationships. But it would be a substitute for that urge to ""get laid"" just because the person feels they ""need sex,"" which leads to one-night stands and casual sex. Teens seem to be unable to handle casual sex maturely because the decision making part of their brain doesn't develop until the 20's. The buildup of hormones that you mentioned leads to a need for sexual release. The body doesn't really care how it gets it, it just wants an orgasm. It is the responsibility of the person to exercise self control in a way that is healthy, not suppressive."

As for the US, the Portugal game is key. Ghana is beatable and Germany isn't, but if we can manage to get at least a point against them we'll have a good chance of going through. During qualification they were a two-men team between Moutinho and Ronaldo, and if somehow Ronaldo can be cut off from Moutinho and be limited to one goal, we'll have a good chance of equalizing or outdoing Portugal's flimsy defence.

I think there's actually a pretty fair chance of three CONCACAF teams getting through to the knockout round, but the third team getting through will be dependent on limiting Ronaldo's impact."

your dentist/dental hygienist can use a tool that measures the depth of the pocket in between your gum and your tooth and it will tell you how bad you are.  

if you've had gingivitis for awhile, it can get worse and turn into periodontal disease which is not fun. i have to go to the dentist every 3 months rather than every six.

You're obviously a brave person if you moved to a different country to live on your own initially, so you have to regain that confidence you had before. 

Sometimes I feel like my boyfriend is my only friend as well now that I'm getting older and not in college. I sought out groups on meetup and similar websites where I could meet people with the same interests as me. I joined a writing club and a book club, and have some sports one available as well. Maybe look around for other activities you like, or something you've been really wanting to get into, and take the next step.

I know you've already got the drama club and you're on the precipice of breaking into hanging out outside of the club. How about maybe instead of being like 'Hey, these are the plans I already have, come if you can,' you try a different approach. Tell them you want to hang out outside of club and see what days/times work for everyone. That would probably lead to a bigger turn out.

Aside from that, try to reconnect with the old friends that you feel like are leaving you out of plans. Tell them how you feel like you've barely seen them outside of work, and that you want to plan something to catch up.

I also recommend exercising. Maybe get a gym membership, buy a cheap bike, start running, practice some yoga...really anything. This could give you a lot of time to clear your head, lose the stress and regain some balance in your life.

Good luck! Be strong -- you got this girl! You just have to force yourself to get out of the rut, and once you do, you'll never regret it!"

&gt;people who take them and do as they see fit convince said women to stop posting

Are you crazy? Seriously, have you lost your mind? A woman with **JJ CUP** boobs and long black hair posts naked pictures of herself on the internet and is shocked that some people will take them? Btw, you do realize ""take"" is silly in this sense, right? The moment I view that pic, it's in my browser cache. That pic is mine. That pic is also anyone else's who views it. Guys are visual and a good number of them will lose their mind (not literally) if they see the object of their affection. I've seen it first hand myself while with my girlfriend. A guy sees that woman that's the object of his desire and he goes bonkers. That's the power a beautiful woman has. All beautiful women know this. You don't work a man up with desire, then act shocked when he does things like save her pics and repost them. I wouldn't be surprised if some men tried to contact her personally or even search for her. Quite frankly, she'd be stupid to think otherwise.

&gt;as long as people think like you, we have less beauties to look at

I'll repeat this again since you didn't pick up on what I said the first time. THIS IS NOT MY OPINION!! I'VE NEVER REPOSTED A GWER'S PIC BEFORE. I'VE NEVER PM'D A GWER BEFORE. I'VE NEVER EVEN SAVED A GW'ER PIC. I simply gave the story of this girl. If a beautiful woman posts a pic on GW, I often just upvote, admire and move on. *Sometimes*, I might be inclined to post a comment. For example, one GWer was 6' tall with 36"" inseams. I dated a girl with exactly those measurements and I mentioned that. We had a couple of back and forth comments and that's that.  ""Think like you""? You've missed the mark...again!

&gt;you don't get to do with her pictures as you see fit.

See my above comment.

&gt;you don't get to do with her pictures as you see fit. she does

&gt;respect that, or in your ignorance and lack of respect, ruin it for the rest of us

You're preaching to the choir. I agree with you. At the same time, however, a woman **has** to know that if she's gorgeous, she's going to get all types of attention, some unwanted. A petite Asian woman with long, jet-black hair and JJ boobs is shocked when people repost her pic? Again, she's a damned fool is she thought that wouldn't happen!"

You shouldn't let 'the market' bother you. Just write something you like. If you enjoy writing a book and it doesn't sell, then at least you enjoyed writing it. If you write something you hate and it doesn't sell, then you've wasted a ton of time."

Cap_Had,explainlikeimfive,1390254318.0,"&gt; Fun fact: the effects of relativistic time dilation mean that photons literally do not experience time. As far as the photon is concerned, it arrives in literally the same moment as it left.
A photon might travel six nanoseconds from a lightbulb to your eye, or might go thirteen point whatever billion years from the big bang*, cross the entire universe, to finally land on a Cosmic Microwave Background detector's sensor. Doesn't matter. As far as that photon was concerned, it was absorbed in literally the same moment as it was created.

I basically agree, but I think a better way to say it is that the idea of experiencing things (i.e. having a rest reference frame) is just not something that applies to photons. The answer isn't that they experience everything at the same time, it's that asking what a photon experiences is a bad question in the first place."

However as time progressed, I became more and more attracted to him. I still think past guys I have dated were more attractive, but the fact that he has a lot more going for him and is more of a whole package attracts me. Also the fact that we get along so well.

Now I gave him a chance because in the past I have become attracted to guys after time, who have amazing personalities. So personally, I wouldn't break up with him right away if you're having a good time. I'm 23 as well, you're young, you have a lot of time. 

I don't lie to my bf. I honestly didn't say to him that I found him attractive until at least a month in, but I also didn't tell him I found him unattractive. I don't like to say things I don't mean, but thats just me.


If you do find yourself wanting to break up, just say you don't want something serious (which you mentioned to him, and it seems he sort of pressured you into committing) and that you want to meet other people before settling down. 

Again most of this is based on my experiences so I guess it's difficult to tell you what to do. "

His browser was open to an email account I didn't know existed and there was a message from ""Sara"" with details of what she loved about the last time they were together and how she couldn't wait to see him in a few days. 

I didn't call him right away. My curiosity got the best of me and I went through the folders in the email account. I found registrations for AdultFriendFinder, ALT, and numerous CL ads/responses. I went in to a slight state of shock and called him. 

He came home immediately and told me he needed help and that he would never do it again. Asked me if I thought anyone would believe me. Reminded me his business depended on his reputation. 

So we went to counseling. He kept cheating. A year and a half later, after finding photographic evidence of recent activity, I walked and began the really ugly divorce process. 

Dec 2013 was my five year divorce anniversary. In Oct 2014 I'll finish paying it off. Feels damn good.

Life-in-Death,AskMen,1390254738.0,"Hey, I know this isn't advice, but it might give you a bit of insight into why women may go for some guys that seem like ridiculous choices...

I have fallen for: rich, poor, not-really-attractive, hot, fat, thin, has their life on the super-train track, is a complete, addicted mess.

I have also gone out with wonderful, attractive, successful, compatible guys and...nothing.

The thing is, all those items above are important but they don't really determine who you will fall for.  It is all in how the guy makes you feel.  Does he make you laugh? Does he find you equally as funny?  Does he tease and joke around with you?  Does he make you feel special?  Is he outgoing/kind to your friends and to strangers?  Those are the things that cause spark.  

Spark can be so strong that women ignore red flags (like addictions, etc.) but it is so important no matter how good a guy is ""on paper"" it is nothing without the spark.

Yes, being driven and together is a total ""perk"" on your end and it will ensure that similar women will be connected to you on that level but you can't expect to show up and put your resume on a table and expect the  girl to fall for you.

But this is a good thing.  You don't want a woman who is just like: job, check. Dresses well, check.  You want one that is completely excited by you, not that you are some Guy X that met her requirements.

I just saw:
&gt; Ignore you because you aren't fun in her eyes, you don't drink

Are you saying they don't think you are fun because you don't drink, or because of other reasons?  Fun is key.  You can do it without drinking.  It doesn't mean that you have to be a comedian or a loud mouth but I can't imagine a relationship without fun as a main component.

Also realize not drinking is going to make the subset of women you are compatible with even smaller.  I am in *no* way telling you not to drink, just know that it might take more time.

I agree that you need to go somewhere where there are more eligible women.  But maybe it would be a good thing to try to initiate some low-stakes hangouts, with no pressure for a relationship, just to go out and have a good time."

Yes, that's obviously why every nucleophile around here is so hyped up on breeders, thorium and fusion... because we already have an unlimited supply. Those, including seawater are all plausible projects that aren't anywhere near economic, practical applications yet... or why else do you need those research billions for?

&gt;What?? We do. It was only reasonably a great advancement was made in the inertial confinement for the plasma.

It's still nowhere near a practical application. Time's running low. Even the optimists among fusion physicists put the first working model around 2060, and then you still have got to produce and build a fleet of working fusion plants at an affordable cost with affordable materials by people with affordable training. That alone will suck up any surplus production for the rest of the century. Let's face it, fusion is wonderful long-term project.

wweezzee,TwoXChromosomes,1390254802.0,"&gt;Or should all partners make exactly the same amount of money, regardless their potential differences in career fields, age, time in the workplace, etc?

No. My partner makes more than I do and is younger than me (by 4 months, ha). I make a decent amount, though, so right now, since we are not married, we live at a level of living where I can afford half the costs. His extra is his. 

&gt;Some people want an entirely 50/50 relationship in all aspects. But reality really means that you'll average out to 50/50, but some points in the relationship are going to be 40/60 or 30/70, and sometimes even 10/90. And that's not just financially, either.

I agree. We don't know if we'll get married, or if we will have kids. We've talked about it and if we have kids, and if he is in a good paying, stable job, I would stay home for 4 or 5 years and then get back out into the workplace. If he lost his job, I would support him and I'm quite sure he would do the same for me. Every relationship is different, with different nuances. 

&gt;Looking for someone who has a plan and is practicing that plan effectively is a far better indicator of future financial success, even if they're managing a sizeable debt-load.

Agreed. My boyfriend just graduated law school (and passed the bar, but is not practicing law for some weird reason). He did get out debt free with a combination of scholarships, small inheritance from grandfather, and money from HS/college jobs. He went to undergrad in Georgia and got out for free with their HOPE scholarship. He's lucky and hardworking. If he came out of school with loans, I wouldn't outright dismiss him. However, I'd want to know his plans. 

I wasn't saying everything should be 50/50, just that its nice to be on similar financial footings. We both are debt free, with liquid savings and retirement savings. We're pretty compatible financially. That's all I was saying. "

ctesibius,motorcycles,1390254864.0,"/u/StuartTwittle gives good advice, but I'd go further on one point. Keep your hand and foot *off* the brake when you go in to a corner. As a new rider, it's going to be very difficult to resist the temptation to brake when you find yourself going in too fast, so do not cover the brakes. Instead, if you find you're going to fast, lean more. If you're dangling over so far your elbows are grounding and it's not enough - lean until your earlobes ground. Just *don't brake*. The tyres are made of superglue boiled up with Spiderman's secretions, and they will grip to the road like a chugger to a pedestrian - just so long as you don't brake.

Now doing that means that you will go in to the corners slowly rather than slowing on the entrance. That's fine: just wait until you see the exit and open the throttle. The bike will settle in to the bend and track as though it's on rails. It's a great feeling.

Eventually you can introduce a bit of braking on the entrance to corners, but do a few thousand miles first with no brakes, as over-braking on a corner is one of the commonest causes of falls with no other vehicle involved.

One other related matter: ok, so you've gone in too fast and need to lean more. How do you do it? Just pull back a little on your outside hand (so left hand if you are turning right and vice versa). This is called ""countersteering"" and is the best way to get the bike to turn quickly, so practice it from a straight line."

Bastard is still an insult to women because the 'insult' is that a woman dared to have sex and a child outside of wedlock. Almost all general insult terms specific to men originate as insults to women, either through insinuating that the man in question is feminine somehow (sissy), through implicating or insulting his mother (SOB, bastard) or both (mama's boy). The one exception I can think of is dick, which despite its contemporary phallic implications began as a slang for detective.

As you can see from [here](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+e%5E-x+*x%5E1.5), the solution to this integral uses the error function.  If you haven't learned about the error function in your class, then it probably isn't expected for you to get this answer.

Are you sure the exponent for the x^1.5 is supposed to be 1.5?  If it's an integer, then the integration is relatively simple by using integration by parts.

Also, if you've learned about taylor series, you could write the taylor series of e^-x, multiply it by x^(1.5), the integrate that.  The answer will be in terms of an infinite summation, but it will give you an answer that doesn't involve the error function.

Finally, you could have misinterpreted the problem.  So, unless you've learned about the error function, we really need more details to help you."

The more confidence you exude (fake or real), the more likely they are to want to hug you and get to know you. It's just about stepping away from what's comfortable and putting yourself out there. If it doesn't work, you just have to try it on someone else. There's nothing more you can do in that instance but move on.

Everyone has the potential to be confident, the scrawniest guy and the biggest. That's the great thing about confidence, you don't have to look a certain way to be eligible. You just have to stand up straight, stick your chest out, stand your ground and state your claim (in this case, that you're a fucking great hugger and you will settle for no less).

nomdeplume_,AskWomen,1390255215.0,"It's not really ""feminine"" to be aggressive or open in your disapproval. Women are socialized to be supportive and passive. Thence, less acceptable feelings manifest in ""guerrilla warfare,"" if you will; I think that's why some women are manipulative and underhanded about their agenda. I also have noticed that the women who engage in this type of behavior tend to seek a lot of male attention. I'm not sure what the nexus is, but I think it has to do with having bought into the patriarchal belief system.    

By the way, I detect some defensiveness, and I just want to clarify that criticizing patriarchy is in no way criticizing men. If you're open to new ideas, you should look into Bell Hooks. She addresses how patriarchy hurts men too (e.g. unrealistic expectations of what it means to be a man, societal distrust of men, etc).    


- ‚ÄúThe power of patriarchy has been to make maleness feared and to make men feel that it is better to be feared than to be loved. Whether they can confess this or not, men know that just is not true.‚Äù 
-Bell Hooks 

- ‚ÄúThis fear of maleness that they inspire estranges men from every female in their lives to greater or lesser degrees, and men feel the loss. Ultimately, one of the emotional costs of allegiance to patriarchy is to be seen as unworthy of trust. If women and girls in patriarchal culture are taught to see every male, including the males with whom we are intimate, as potential rapists and murderers, then we cannot offer them our trust, and without trust there is no love.‚Äù 
-Bell Hooks, The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love

- ‚ÄúPower feminism is just another scam in which women get to play patriarchs and pretend that the power we seek and gain liberates us.‚Äù 
-Bell Hooks

- ""When culture is based on a dominator model, not only will it be violent but it will frame all relationships as power struggles.‚Äù

Queen street West (Parkdale) after Dufferin. It's what was the Plateau a while back before it got gentrify. Pretty much what Saint-Viateur and Verdun are starting to be. Still cheap, a bit dirty and dingy, but interesting stuff going on.

Kensington Market would also be a good bet. It's a bit more hippyish than the other areas, but it might be the best combination of cheap, relax and walkable in Toronto.

Now, I'm not saying that he's a thug, or that he that he isn't smart football-wise, but he got a 990 on his SAT (also, a 24 on his Wonderlic) and would not have gotten into Stanford had he not been 6-3 and been able to run a 4.5 40.

You know, my doctor didn't think my results were amazing.  :(

Here is a direct quote from my doctor that accompanied the results.  I've omitted sections that reference my name or my doctors name.

&gt;Your cholesterol is a bit high for some of the tests. 
Since you don't have other risk factors (no diabetes, non smoker) I recommend trying diet and exercise first and we can repeat the lipid panel in a few months. 

&gt;As you see, your LDL is high (""bad cholesterol"") but your ""good cholesterol"" or HDL is normal (which is cardio protective). 

&gt;Prior to starting a medication, we can attempt to decrease the cholesterol and LDL through diet, exercise, and weight loss. 

&gt;The type of diet to start is to avoid concentrated sugars and cut back on carbohydrates to focus on overall reduced intake of calories (especailly high glycemic and high fructose foods-examples of what to avoid are potatoes, white bread, juices and non-diet soda, white rice, pizza, french fries, candy, etc).

&gt;If you are able, you would also benefit from a moderate aerobic exercise program. 

&gt;In order to keep your HDL up (""good cholesterol)"" you can switch your fat intake from the above foods to those with high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids such as salmon, olive oil, nuts, avocados.

&gt; If you would like, we can try diet and exercise for a few months, and then repeat the blood test. If this is not working, we can discuss starting a medication if needed.

I think it is awesome that my doctor seems to be advocating sugar reduction.  But holy crap... if I reduce my sugar any further I will have to go to zero!!

And I already eat tons of omega 3 foods.  Although not fish.  I really don't like fish.

Also, I think High Intensity Exercise might be better than aerobic, but I'm not completely certain."

Life-in-Death,AskMen,1390255624.0,"Hey, I just wrote a comment about ""spark"" above explaining what it is for me.  

I am surprised that you think ""hot"" is a primary factor for women.  Of course it can be an instant attractor, like it is for men, but so many women go for not-hot guys.  (Woody Allen?)

""Spark"" is chemistry.  It is what makes you attracted to the person.  Attraction goes way further than physical.  I have dated enough that I know *exactly* what caused it in me.  It it being hilarious (from outrageous to supremely witty), thinking I'm hilarious, teasing, bantering, take-charge, and has super-etiquette.  This is not some laundry list I am looking for, it is a recipe I have found when guys pull it off I am putty. 

For another girl it may be a shy, sensitive, brooding thing, for another it may be some cocky ass that she likes.

But if this ability was about seeing the actual thing themselves then...

Smells are volatilized chemical compounds. They are real physical things that can be traced. So in order to see them that would mean that I would have to be able to identify them at the molecular level i.e. super magnification eyes.

Sounds, on the other hand, are vibration created through the generation of waves through pressure and displacement. So if I wanted to see sounds I'd have to be able to process information fast enough that I can identify very small vibrations in all sorts of medium, i.e. Super processing brain.

I'd pick sound still. How cool would it be if you can look at the simplest of things like a falling leaf and see the subtle soft sounds that it makes as it travels through the air. If you wanted to find a quite place you can actually go look for one. It'd be so cool."

Media is made by human beings, and human beings aren't perfect, and often our media reflects the imperfections in our society. But if you had to entirely forgo ANYTHING that had problematic aspects to it, you wouldn't be able to enjoy like 99% of things.

For instance, I love to play video games. I own something like 30 PS3 games, for example. And if I separated them into stacks based on if they had problematic aspects, were neutral, or were really positive for oppressed peoples, those stacks would go from ""pretty large"" to ""we've got a handful here"" to ""one or two, maybe?""

Does this mean I shouldn't play video games? Of course not. For one thing, you can't criticize something fully until you've actually experienced it. I couldn't very well say that video games are sexist if I never played video games. Also, the more and more women play games and get involved in their development, the more that culture of sexism (and other issues like racism, homophobia, etc.) changes.

So yeah, you can totally enjoy problematic media. Because life isn't about black and white, you absolutely hate it or absolutely love it kind of feelings. It's about ranges and complexity. Of course you're allowed to like movies or tv shows or games that are pretty sexist, but isn't it also true that you get super excited by a movie or show or game that is incredibly positive? For example, I really like Lord of the Rings and I've seen both the Hobbit movies so far. I recognize all the wonderful work that Tolkien put into the series, as well as the efforts of the actors and director and all the production staff for the movies. But when I got into Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire, that became my new favorite medieval fantasy series. Why? Because unlike LotR, GoT acknowledges things like sexism, ableism, and other societal problems and actually gives a pretty diverse range of characters and perspectives.

So don't feel like you're a bad woman or feminist for liking Casablanca. Just as long as you know that it has problems and you're willing to work for a future where we have better media to choose from."

silverionmox,europe,1390255725.0,"&gt;The graph you posted only includes R&amp;D expenditure. Since renewables are already commercially exploitable, it is only natural that the state will not foot the (entire) bill.

And how is that a disadvantage for renewables?

&gt;xcept, he does through subsidies for installed renewables. In 2007, Germany alone subsidised them with over 4 billion, i.e. about twice the total EU R&amp;D expenditure for that year, pushing total subsidies to over 100 billion Euros. So, total fusion funding (R&amp;D) has long been surpassed by total renewable funding (R&amp;D + operational subsidies), even just using German numbers for renewables.

In that case you've got to count the implicit guarantees the state gives to nuclear power too. And the cold war budgets used to mine and refine uranium we're using now. And the implicit burden to the future generations to safeguard the waste. The first alone would bankrupt every nuclear plant.

&gt;Fusion has taken into account the experiences from fission and can with quite some certainty say that its promises are not empty

A working fusion generator was promised for the year 2000.

&gt; this time this is not an empty promise but a rather clear goal.

With a delay of half a century on record those promises are certified empty. Nuclear fusion is not an energy research project, it's a fundamental research project with potential ground-breaking applications in the very long term. It's amazing which mental gymnastics people are capable of to argue at the same time that the risk for fission to go wrong can safely be swept under the carpet, but the chance for fusion to work soon is a certainty.

&gt;. The unavoidable truth is that they are, at the moment, not able to power today's dense populations

Neither is a NONEXISTENT power source like fusion. It's vexing how people keep pushing the goalposts and declaring every imperfection of renewables an insurmountable horde while even aspects like the non-existence of fusion are waved away.

&gt;unless we are willing to remain dependent on rather unstable countries.

Because surely they're going to embargo the wind, sun and geothermal supply, right?

&gt;Research into renewables will not easily ameliorate this situation

You can, by definition, not predict what research will do. I can, however, predict that any minor improvement in renewables can and will be applied quickly by the markets. I can also predict that even a perfectly serendipitous turn of events in fusion research will not deliver a significant energy supply before the end of the century.

&gt;renewable power generation, both solar and wind, are close to their theoretical optima. Big advances can only be expected for storage facilities, but that won't solve their power density issues.

That's not a disadvantage; as it happens, our power consumption is distributed too and believe it or not, syncs up pretty well with the availability of sunlight. We're perfectly able to make ends meet with increasing quantity and quality of the sources on one hand, and efficiency gains, improved distribution and demand management on the other hand. And any storage tools we manage to couple to the web will only make that easier.

The only reason to bet everything on fusion is an old-fashioned adherence to big power plants."

KeepSantaInSantana,AskReddit,1390255951.0,"I was dating a guy for a couple of months.  He had a lot of female friends, which didn't bother me at all.  2 of them in particular started to hate me since they essentially stopped seeing him when we started dating, but I very openly encouraged him to hang out with them and would invite them over when I was going to see them (which they of course never took me up on since I'm the devil).  He was sick of their bitching so he just stopped being their friend.


A few weeks later a friend of mine says that she saw him out with some girl.  Not really an issue for me, as I said I was used to him having female friends.  The part that bothered me was that I knew where he was at, because we had been talking about what our plans were for that day and he made it sound like he was seeing a male friend (using male pronouns, and using a nickname that sounded male even though it's a nickname she never went by).  I brought it up to him and he denied it, then made a stink when I got mad.  They supposedly didn't do anything while we were dating, and from what I hear she loses interest in seeing him when he's single. 


I dumped him for lying.  I don't expect someone to drop all the women in their life because they're seeing me, but if they feel the need to lie about it something is definitely up.  If I found out my SO cheated on me, I'd be gone.  I have major trust issues once that seal has been broken, and would never be able to trust him again.  It's the reason why essentially every one of my relationships has ended, I've caught the guy in a big lie and they just deny it to the death.  I've known my husband for about a decade and we've always had a very open friendship which translated beautifully into a relationship."

Older men are more mature (MOST of the time) and have a lot more life experience. Some say this makes them being with younger women a predatory thing, and to be fair it probably is, but it's also very helpful as a young female. It gives you a chance to get out of that petty drama. Some may do it for money, but that's not me. My SO is unemployed and has been almost the entire time I was with him. I just find it easier to form connections with older people than with people my own age - I always have. Even in Elementary school teachers called me an ""old soul.""

&gt;1. The opinion of a real life friend is worth 1,000 internet opinions.
6. The cost of aftermarket (magazines, holsters, etc.) should be dead last on the list of things to look for in a gun.
10. All gun salesmen are morons.

These are all just plain wrong.

 Most of my friends don't know half as much about guns as I do, considering I got them into the hobby and taught them most of what they know about it.
I am aware I don't know everything, so I go to where there are there are more knowledgeable people who can answer my questions, forums.

If the gun comes with one magazine, and replacements are 70 bucks, and there are no holsters available for it, and any aftermarket upgrades like triggers and grips cost half as much as the gun does, than you probably won't be able to afford to do all you want with it and still be able to afford enough ammo to get good with the damn thing.

You may have shit gun salesmen where you are, but half of the ones around me are very knowledgeable, reasonable to work with, and very helpful when trying to make big decisions without trying to rip you off.

Those are the worst ones, most of the others are fine or actually good, but don't talk out your ass here."

The66Ripper,AskMen,1390256260.0,"Two responses to that, first off, it's not about being super confident all the time, just when it matters. Say you're at someone's place and some of his friends that you don't know come over. Time to get that confidence up, introduce yourself properly, and have a bit more of a conversation than normal. Over time you'll see that being confident is more fun than being introverted. It's not about doing a 180 and acting like you have the biggest balls around, it's about baby steps.

Secondly, stop caring so much about what people think of you. Not to the point of not caring at all, but moreso to the point of allowing yourself to change and be different without worrying about their responses. More likely than not, you're putting your own thoughts on yourself in their minds. It's like that [dove beauty sketches ad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpaOjMXyJGk). We see ourselves in a certain way and assume that's how others perceive us, but the people who are around you haven't known you for as long as you have, and see the good in you rather than the bad.  If you put on a facade of confidence, stand up straighter and be more direct, they'll just see it as a boost in confidence, not an act. In the end, you are the only one who will know that you're faking it, and after a while, you won't have to fake it."

silverionmox,europe,1390256362.0,"&gt; First off, technology is not like in a video game, ""research for 50 years, gain tech"".

That's exactly why it's so silly to see people proclaim ""fusion can solve all our problems if only we fund it enough!""... or ""we'll just fund fusion and all our problems will magically be solved in 2050 as the technology fairie descends"".

&gt;Do you honestly think money spent on fusion power now are wasted, because we magically will get the technology in 2050 or 2100?

I don't think it's wasted, but it's not energy research. It should be taken out of the energy budget so we can spend that money on real energy research. As such, transferring it to renewables is sound policy.

&gt;Secondly, in east asia, there are over 3 billion people working their way into modern, industrialized societies. I'm sure windmills and solar panels make sense in your head, but not even small, rich European countries have any hope of meeting energy demands that way. 

Neither will they with fusion this century.

&gt;When coal power is growing in Europe, what do you think it is in eastern asia?

They too use renewables where they can. That's just another reason to fund renewable research, in particular solar energy: especially in the densely populated equator areas that's a godsend. Or do you want them to breathe coal for a century or two until it's their turn for fusion?

&gt;Renewables doesn't even matter. The only real contestants are nuclear and coal.

I would tell my people that we cannot spend all our time looking for who to blame, rather we should be focusing all of our effort on rebuilding our great country. I would open my borders to allow anyone to enter and anyone to leave.

I would create treaties with the United States, France, England, and Russia. I would open up trade with these countries, most importantly the US because of it's vast amount of raw materials. I would teach my new allies technological advances that my country has learned and let them teach my people as well. Scientists working with scientists. Doctors working with doctors. I would open up a labor program to give jobs to unemployed Germans and Austrians who lost everything they had in the war.

In the late 30s and early 40s, I would start a campaign to colonize many parts of North Africa. Sort of what Hitler did during WW2, but with less military force and more diplomatic process. I would send crates of food and raw materials to trade to become good friends with the Northern African countries that didn't need to be colonized.

Breklinho,concacaf,1390256433.0,"1. Caribbean League. Installing a professional league to follow and play in will help in developing the median talent on the islands and help out the smaller islands' national teams, the impact of having a respectable first division on a national team can be seen in MLS' effect on the US, and having a local league for Caribbean players to play and get paid in will help push players to make the jump professionally and assist in their development.

2. Academies. Countries like Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and to a lesser extent Haiti and Cuba have consistently been producing a handfull solid players at the CONCACAF level per generation, and a system to develop youth talent consistently and at a level capable of competing in Gold Cups in the next 10 or so years, and competing to be part of the Hex or it's equivalent 20-25 years from now. Right now many of these islands and have been struggling to get players into youth academies due to the lack of demand for Caribbean players; Jamaica has really done a good job of taking advantage of NCAA and MLS in recent years as both leagues favor the athleticism and speed many of their players offer, but most other islands have struggled to get their talent to have a foothold in foreign leagues.

3. Recruiting dual-nationals. A strong national team can unify a country behind the team, inspire youth and serve as a motivator to improve the domestic league to the standard required for national team success. Many English, American and French raised professionals are also eligible for Caribbean teams, and recruiting the guys that won't be in the picture for the Three Lions and the like can and will help improve the standard of play within national teams; recently Haiti has done a good job of recruiting guys like Picquionne and Jean-Eudes Maurice, and that pattern needs to continue to continue to raise the standard for the Caribbean teams.

4. Partnering with other CONCACAF clubs. Sending the players in the Caribbean league on loan to USL, NASL, Central American Leagues or even MLS and Liga MX to train or play will help them develop their skills at a higher standard, so those skills and experience can be brought back to their respective clubs and teammates.

5. Making Pro/Rel a part of the Caribbean League from the very beginning. MLS was a different league in a different country where teams could be jump started with a few million dollars, and where the league was very much built from the bottom down, focusing on creating the teams, getting the players and making a respectable league to inspire the grassroots aspects of the league that have been growing significantly over the past few years. The Caribbean doesn't have access to the cash that made MLS something out of nothing, and will have to be built from the bottom up, improving local clubs on local islands that will be supported and largely funded by locals: the league will have to be built from the bottom up, as opposed to MLS' top down approach. The Caribbean's focus on local teams from small markets and smaller communities will necessitate ease of advancement through a second or third division up to the Caribbean ""Premier"" League in order to include smaller islands with populations in the range of 200,000 to 1,000,000 a spot in the new league system where they can focus on developing their teams safe from the presumably larger clubs from Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti (the country has a large population in the range of 10,000,000 and seems like the perfect candidate for a Cinderella story as the country rallies behind the sport in a time of mass poverty) and Puerto Rico. The Pro/Rel comes in by giving the smaller teams something to aspire to and strive for, providing an incentive for smaller teams and allowing the plethora of different sub-cultures and countries access to the first division; this isn't MLS where Pro/Rel could stifle the growth of teams being jump-started from big investors where the threat of relegation would limit the establishment of new teams that are meant to be serious competitors in the league within 2-4 years, the Caribbean league won't have big investors to protect and will be built as I feel like I've said 500 times already from the bottom up, and a key part of any grassroots soccer movement coming from the lower and middle class is the prospect of promotion into a higher league with better competition and more revenue.

6. Most importantly, **money**. Most of the Caribbean islands don't have the economies to individually have a respectable domestic league or generate the revenue to support an academy system; unifying into a single league could remedy the first issue, but unless teams can offer a livable wage or equivalent (I know down in Belize professionals are paid in groceries, so they don't necessarily have a salary but they won't have to look elsewhere for food and housing) players won't stay in the league. Now whether the Caribbean League will focus on developing itself as an independent entity focused on on-field quality like MLS has done or if it will focus on giving young players the abilities necessary to move abroad and succed elsewhere like the Scandinavian or South American leagues will be up to them, with the latter being a more financially sustainable model, will be decided by it's higher ups, but if the league is going to gain any sort of stability there's going to need to be cash to jump start teams and support them with the travel required for cross-island travel. Likely clubs will look abroad for financial support and who knows if we'll have Red Bulls Kingston fifteen years from now, but however it comes to teams, money is a prerequisite to develop any semblance of a respectable league, there's around 40 million people living in the countries that presumably would be included in the Caribbean Leagues so the raw population is there, but money is going to be needed to support the league."

But for every one of them:
* They need it. It's not convenient, it doesn't increase their revenue stream, they rely on it to function properly.
* The makers of the program are vaguely active in the community and have earned some trust. Well, you should really only trust software for which source code has been published, but let's be lax here.

For games, people are already weary of excess permissions. Root access literally means giving this game permission to unencrypt and upload a copy of your filesystem to its servers, after which it soft bricks your phone. It's a fucking game.

Rangers only have access to certain pets unless they take the Beastmaster archetype.  The list of animal companions will tell you what companions are available to rangers.

Spells are spells, just gotta look through the list and see what she wants.  

The combat style you choose (archery by the sounds of it) will decide a lot of her combat feats as well as give you ideas for what feats to take.  If she wants to do something a long with the archery that's what you'd use the normal feats for and not the combat style ones she gets."

The rear suspension will compress a little (""squat"") and the front suspension will stretch, which is why the bike feels more stable as you accelerate through a bend. Obviously don't over-do it: as with braking while banked over, you can break traction, but as the engine is weaker than the brakes this is unlikely to be a problem.

Conversely, if you panic brake on the entrance to a bend (and before you're got much lean on), you're going to find it very difficult to get off the brakes and turn it. This is a psychological effect rather than a physical one, but the result is that you carry on in a straight line braking heavily and either run out of road, or recover and go through the bend at walking speed and your mates rag you about it later."

I've only started dating men in the past couple years and dear christ, I feel like they're 10x more complicated. The last one I broke up with was more dramatic and passive aggressive during the break up than all the women I've dated combined. 

In public, lesbian relationships are harder to imply without words. And I realized I've been conditioned to not be super affectionate in public because it's treated like a live cam show or some shit. I also had a wtf moment when I realized that walking down the street with a guy (vs a girl) halts all sexual harassment.

codayus,feedthebeast,1390256701.0,"I agree with everything in your comment.  I think you might have misread mine.

* I didn't say that the mod interactions /u/linksblinker listed weren't in 1.6.4; I said they were also in earlier versions (which they were).
* My comments about GT were limited to the overall direction GT has headed in the past year or so.  Nothing you said about GT disagreed with anything I said; you're discussing features, not changes.
* My comments about the current IC2 builds were discussing IC2 without GT (as it exists in current FTB packs, since this is an FTB subreddit).  Nothing you said about GT making current IC2 easier disagreed with anything I said.  (In fact, I think that just highlights the actual point in my comment, which was focused on how much harder IC2 is.  If GT‚Äîwhich hasn't changed that much‚Äîis now easier than IC2, then what does that say about IC2?)
* The electrolyzer and the centrifuge are indeed great.  :)

TL;DR:  You seem to be saying correct things about GT.  This is unrelated to my comment, which was mostly about current IC2 *without* GT (with a side comment that the direction and philosophy of the changes made to IC2 reminds me of the direction and philosophy of the changes made to GT).

Edit:  I'm curious to see what the latest GT looks like; I manually added it to Unleashed for a while before eventually deciding that it just wasn't worth the effort given the changes.  This was, however, before he'd implemented the full bronze age stuff, and before the experimental IC2 builds.  Can you recommend a pack (on the FTB or ATLauncher, hopefully), that shows off the latest version of GT well?"

The signature starts with an A and appears to end with a TH. There is a visible symbol after the A that appears to be either a U, or an LI. between that and the TH is some space that could be a missed stroke.

Aside from that I still disagree. A number of these groups are primarily influential through their wealth, which because of how marriage works is largely available to their spouses. In addition the fact that women are largely responsible for child rearing gives an enourmous amount of power to shape society's values (which is the kind of power being discussed), possibly a power without equal.

Gollygoshdarnscurvy,AskWomen,1390256935.0,"As Emily Post said, ""Etiquette isn‚Äôt a set of ‚Äúprescriptions for properness‚Äù but merely the guidelines for doing things in ways that make people feel comfortable."" 

And, you will be glad to know, the Emily Post Institute has ruled on the matter.  

[Business Etiquette is Gender Neutral](http://www.emilypost.com/on-the-job/office-issues/795-gender-and-business)

Today, work environments are filled with both men and women working side by side. With the significant rise of women in the workplace, also comes a new set of social concerns. While it's always a good idea to check first, here's a list of general guidelines for everyday situations.

Holding a door. Whoever arrives at the door first holds it for others.

Getting off an elevator. The person closest to the door exits first

Paying for a meal. Today, whoever does the inviting pays for the meal.

Standing. Male or female, standing to greet someone is always polite. This is especially important when the person is of higher rank or a client.

*Shaking hands. Today, a man does not need to wait for a woman to offer her hand before he extends his. Whether you are a man or a woman, always remember to shake hands!* 

Helping to carry something. Everyone appreciates some help when they are overloaded with books or packages. Regardless of your gender, lend your co-workers a helping hand when they are in need.

IndependentBoof,nfl,1390256969.0,"You're absolutely right. Thug doesn't describe him well at all. Sherman plays a pretty clean game and doesn't have a reputation for sneaking guns into clubs or anything like that. Actually, Crabtree strikes me as more of a thug than Sherman.

And I'm sure that Crabtree talked all sorts of crap before and during the game. My only complaint is that it would have been classy for Sherman to just let his play speak for itself (which it did). He doesn't have to humiliate other people by running his mouth.

If this was a one-time event, I'd let it slide as something in the heat of the moment. It was out of the line for Crabtree to push him in the facemask, so it could evoke some emotions in the moment.

However, Sherman has a history. He is known for his mouth as much as he's known for his playing. I'd like to see him not only be an elite cornerback, but also an example of sportsmanship and respect. Russell Wilson showed that admirably even as a young player. Meanwhile, Sherman came across as petty and immature."

ashwinmudigonda,india,1390257083.0,"dogecoin is a cryptocurrency. A crpytocurrency is an internet-based currency where it has to first be mined (by solving problems) and then can be exchanged/traded between two computers using an algorithm (that verifies the value as it hops from node to node).

From a layman's perspective, think of it as Paypal without the country's currency attached to it. You can send money from one PC to another and it takes a few hours for the transfer to happen. There is a small fee associated in doing this, but it's nowhere close to what big banks charge for the same. Chase charges 40$ per wire transfer, for example.

The way the algorithm is set up - the problems for the miners are easy to solve initially. The problems are solved by mining software that you download and run. As more problems are solved, the complexity increases, so the time/effort taken for more currency to enter the pool increases. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency that started this  trend. It caught on later in 2013, and is now spreading pretty fast.

Litecoin, based on Bitcoin (because it was open sourced) was the next crypto to come out. Dogecoin started as a joke (with reference to /r/shibe )  but quickly became a way for people on reddit to tip each other. As of the past few weeks, suddenly doge has become a popular way to send money. 

Because many people were late to the bitcoin party, they felt left out when 1 BTC hit 1000$. Imagine. In 2009, if you had mined bitcoins, you could have ended up with a few thousands of them. And you could have done it with a simple GPU. Many people cashed out and became millionaires.

Doge was created as way to relive that, and many people have thousands to millions of dogecoins sitting in their wallets. They have been tipping each other for comments etc. A doge was worth 0.00000033 BTC two weeks ago. It's worth ~~0.00000144 BTC~~ 0.0000028 BTC as of writing this. So there has been an uptick in interest. A BTC is around 830$ today.

The good folks at /r/dogecoin decided to pool their coins and raise money for the jamaican Olympics team and were successful. Basically all of them diverted some of their coins to a receipient address. That person had millions of dogecoins which he could go to an exchange (www.cryptsy.com for example), exchange it for BTC, transfer it to another Bitcoin trading site (Mt. Gox for example) and get dollars sent to his bank.

They are trying to do that for the Indian team now. And they will easily be successful.

India's RBI initially ~~banned Bitcoin-Rupee exchange, but lifted the ban.~~ cautioned people against virtual currencies. The adoption rate of cryptocurrencies is massive, and soon most of the countries will have to get on board. It's still in the initial stages. Wall St and Silicon Valley are still investing in startups based on cryptos. Some say that by 2014, Amazon will accept BTC and a coin  could be worth 100k $!!

Hope that explains it."

It's almost irresponsible to not do this with all old people.  Sure a lot of us and them don't lead spectacular lives, but each provides a perspective forged in a completely different socio-historical context.

austex_mike,rant,1390257087.0,"I agree with you and I want to go on my own rant: I don't complain about subreddits often, but holy crap /r/offmychest has been ruined by the mods. They spend their time worrying more about preventing people from calling others tranny or cunt, than they do about making it a place for people to get things off of their chest. 

Look, calling people names sucks. But sometimes people need an outlet for their feelings, which was what offmychest was supposed to be. If someone was mugged by two black guys and is upset, I think they should be allowed to work through their feelings by ranting about the niggers who mugged them. (Note I am black myself, but I would still understand if someone wanted to get it off of their chest with racist words.) But if someone went on there and had a rant like that they would be crucified. Both by the judgmental assholes who comment, and the shitlord mods.

So yes, /r/offmychest has been taken over by /r/ShitRedditSays fascists who can't accept anyone who does not hold the same views as them. Yes, there are sexist, misogynist, homophobic, transphobic, racists out there. But censoring them in a place where they should be able to unload their feelings only alienates them more.

So if someone wants to rant about the niggers that mugged them, go right ahead. My only comment as a black man to them would be: ""I am sorry that happened to you, you are right, only niggers act like that, but if you are ever in my neck of the woods this black man would love to take you out for a cup of coffee just as a reminder that not all black people are like that.""

Everything from here to the end I've only been told and have no recollection of myself. The nurse told me I was hit by a car on my bike but I was handed a form saying I had $20 on me, which I didn't remember acquiring. I stayed in the hospital overnight and spend the next day figuring out what happened

I was eventually pointed to the house weed dealer. He told me I had asked him for $20 worth of bud to bring to my friend in a wheelchair, so I called my friend who told me that I rode to him, gave him the bud in a campus health center bag and said ""Here's your prescription,"" took his $20 and rode off.

I still have no clue how I was hit, where I was hit or even if I was actually hit or just smashed into a fire hydrant. Eventually I came across a fraternity brother who took me to the hospital. He said a man they didn't know walked me up to the house all bloodied with my bike around 4:45 p.m. and I told my friends that I was going to bed. They could tell I had some head trauma so they took me to the hospital.

TL;DR - Retrograde amnesia caused by traumatic head injury, friends found me trying to go to bed before 5 p.m. and took me to the hospital

Then, almost four months ago, I had a party at my place. One of my friends, whom I would see once in a while, was there too. We had never really looked at each twice. But that night, we both drank a lot, we were talking to each other and he just kissed me.

We've been inseparable since then. Moving in together next month. He's everything I've ever wished for. And we had known each other for a year before that kiss! The timing probably just wasn't right back then.

So, yeah, I used to find it annoying when someone would tell me *It will happen when you're not looking for it*. But it may just be true. Just enjoy life as much as possible in the meanwhile!"

Organizing 4 levers in the same orientation in something like a solitary room for a vampire works incredibly well. I have a bridge that shuts the entrance to my fort that's magma safe so i don't have to worry about filling my entrance up. After that it's just a matter of filling it and then having some FUN!

I spent years having women stand on their heads trying to get my attention when I felt like they should conduct themselves in a more dignified fashion (hahaha, right?) and being disappointed by what I saw. Trying to make sense of that fact is actually what brought me to TRP.

I've never been bothered to answer the ""why are you so mean?"" question. Even before TRP, I simply refused to waste my time answering questions when I know the other person doesn't want to hear the answer.

&gt; He was no PUA. This guy was naturally aloof with no ability to handle relationships in a 'warm and pleasant' way. So this is how his reactions are downright autistic

Hard to say without knowing his personal background. 

I can remember the first girl I asked out, in ninth grade. She completely ignored me after I did it. So I stopped paying attention to her and she went full retard trying to get my attention after that, eventually even following me on my wayto school (who are we kidding: the word is 'stalking', I just say following because I thought she was cute).

In truth, I made sure to be as brutal as possible in teasing her along after that because I was pissed that she had initially ignored me even though she now obviously liked me. In truth, I've been taking it out on every woman ever since (it doesn't hurt that it works).

Point being that naturally aloof guys are a weird breed. Their motivations can be very difficult to fathom, and they're generally not going out of their way to explain themselves to anyone.

The point of game is to copy what the naturals do best. Mimic aloofness of naturally avoidant men, copy the dread-instilling qualities of sociopaths, bootleg the social butterfly's natural bounce among social circles, and on and on.

Their natural flavor is not the same as tasting ""fishy"".  Mussels also have their own flavor too, but can get that ""fishy"" aftertaste (from the same enzyme breaking down) if they are old as well (in my experience that would be all of the frozen grocery ones, and occasionally I've eaten some fishy ones at restaurants)."

dxdrummer,nfl,1390257489.0,"Original plan was to root for the seahawks (because of nfc west-bros), but

2) the trolling from seahawks fans in /r/49ers this year was already unpleasant, and I dont know if i want to deal with a full year of ""SB CHAMPS!"", trolling, and bandwagoners talking shit when the seahawks won a VERY closely contested game

But on the other side

1) I think manning is good but i dont really care about him

2) it would be nice to see the nfc west win a SB (even though it would be bittersweet because of how close the 9ers have come 3 years in a row)

griffer00,ADHD,1390257524.0,"It might seem strange that Parkinson's Disease and ADHD are both attributable to atypical dopamine activity in the brain. To make things a bit more intuitive, it should be noted that there are different dopamine systems in the brain, each playing different roles. The nigrostriatal dopamine system is involved in goal-directed movements, so problems in this system lead to Parkinsonian symptoms; the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system contributes to attention, cognition, and operant learning, so ADHD's symptoms can be pinned on abnormalities in this system. The existence of these different dopamine systems, and the different roles ascribed to them by the brain, helps explain why a multitude of disorders (with vastly different symptomatology) can arise from dopaminergic dysfunction (e.g. ADHD, PD, schizophrenia, addiction).

That being said, it's important to understand that these disorders are *not* due to dopamine dysfunction: they are due to the inability of neurons, in a given brain region, to utilize dopamine's neuromodulatory ability... for *whatever* reason. Too much/little release, neuron death, receptor protein regulation, dopamine-activated second-messengers, synapse formation, LTP/LTD processes, EEG synchronization... you name it, there are lots of ways that neurons that receive dopamine might improperly utilize the neurotransmitter. The brain region in which dopamine is ""misused"" is what is responsible for observed symptoms.  In PD, it's structures situated in the midbrain and basal ganglia (subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus); in ADHD, it's structures in the midbrain, limbic system, and the cortex (superior colliculus, nucleus accumbens, and prefrontal cortex). 

OP, I'm not arguing with you... just pedantically expanding on what you offered."

fridge_logic,todayilearned,1390257590.0,"I'm glad we agree on most issues, though there is one point I want to add clarification to as I failed to express the correct nuance the first time:

&gt;It is simply impossible to expect the electorate to know enough about all the subjects which matter to make informed decisions on them unless we are to expect the common elector to expend exorbitant amounts of time learning on all of these subjects.
&gt;&gt;It is not impossible. It is a matter of priorities. People choose to be highly informed about the latest details regarding the Kardashians and Miley Cyrus... If instead, people chose to be informed about the issues you listed and more, then they could be, at least to a functional level.

This really comes down to how we define free society. On the one hand education frees us from the tyranny of the intelligent and educated. On the other education saps precious time from the life we would choose to lead under our own governance.

I think our society strikes a respectable balance by attempting to educate the hell out of our youth until age of majority at which we turn the responsibility of education over to the citizen. This balance could be tuned to improve our society but ultimately I think it's a right of the people to choose not to be informed to some degree. Not so much that they could be ruled over by the weakness of their ignorance, but certainly enough so that they can invest themselves thoroughly into their personal industries and pastimes.

And this is part of the kind of ignorance I was saying needs to be respected. A person has a right to not know a thing, that is a price of freedom. And it is the height of pretension to castigate a person for their ignorance when they never even knew why they should care about this thing or that.

The best we can do is is try to make the choice of education more appealing by endeavoring to make the issues of governance more interesting. Traditionally this has been the responsibility of the media and the opposition party but I feel the a state operated media arm (like the BBC) with a focus on content over ratings could be a key element in improving the education of the general electorate. Another method would be to invest more comedic media resources into news programs; Jon Stewart has done a fantastic job of this for the past 15 years and for that I salute him."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390257674.0,"Depends - how close are the friends?  My friends are always there for me when I need them, and sometimes it helps to talk things out.  If my parents got divorced, for example, maybe it would help to talk it out with my friends, especially if they had gone through the same thing.  If a relative dies, I'd usually only share if necessary or if they knew said relative.  Another instance would be if I was upset about it and needed my friends to be there for me.  I think that's reasonable.

I don't like sharing everything with everyone, but my close friends?  That's definitely another story.  We share a lot because we like knowing things about each other, learning about what's going on in each other's lives, etc.

Sand_Dargon,AskWomen,1390257709.0,"Men's clothing is more forgiving then women's.   Women's clothes are made to fit skintight in at least one place on the body, most of the time more then one place.  So, our clothes have spandex included everywhere and are made tight.  Buying a flowy shirt that is meant to be loose is much easier then buying a tight workout shirt or slinky dress.  Men's clothing is rarely meant to be as tight as women's, which is why I can feel confident buying a pair of jeans for my husband without him there, but he would never buy me some.

PS: I absolutely agreed with you until my hubby and I talked about it.  Women's clothing needs more information on the tag then Men's, not less.  Why would the manufacturers put less!?"

If it's Germany's physical gold then whatever form it is currently in is the correct form. Germany doesn't want X tons of gold. They want their gold bars back that they stored. The whole point is that they don't trust the bars haven't been turned into fake tungsten core bars. Germany wants bars with providence and serial numbers they can check. No matter what Germany will melt down whatever they get and reforge new bars.

It's like having a safe that has X amount of paper money it and then getting scared about counterfeit bills because you don't trust the guy looking after your safe. THEN that guy refusing to give back that cash and instead give you these brand new bills instead... because then they can't possibly be counterfeit. Ya right.

The fact that they are resmelting basically confirms that the old gold is gone just as Germany feared. Of course if Germany gets back the correct tonnage of actual gold they are going to not cause waves."

In a truly good society we would accept that there are some who cannot fend for themselves, and rather than allow them to suffer even further for something they cannot fix, many would willingly give up a negligible portion of their own share in order to see them allowed to not just survive, but to truly live.

They need to eat meat. 

Onions and garlic are poisonous to cats.

The shedding is probably happening because you are feeding them a diet of food that doesn't have the nutrients it needs and you are poisoning him.

The only reason he is mellowing out is because you are **slowly killing your cat**. I'd be less harsh but I have a feeling if I was you wouldn't get how serious this is. 

The only problem I see with his behavior would be peeing on your bed. 
Cats don't pee on beds because they don't get enough attention or as ""payback"" for something (or because they are angry or sad or hate you). They do it because something is causing them to avoid the litter box.

How many litter boxes do you have in your house for your cat? How often do you clean the boxes? What kind of litter do you use? How big are the boxes? Is it in a location that is convenient for you but not for the cat (hidden away somewhere because you don't want it visible)? Not having enough boxes, using a litter that is too scented or a litter he doesn't like, not cleaning the boxes often enough, and boxes that are too small can be contributors to this issue. 

Did something happen by the litter box that would have scared him from using it? 

There's also a lot of health problems that could cause avoidance of the litter box: urinary crystals, bladder infection, uti, arthritis in an older cat. Have you had him checked for health problems by a vet? 

Him being ""hyperactive and begging for attention"" could be due to his age. How old is he? How old was he when you got him?"

The66Ripper,AskMen,1390257799.0,"Well you have to try again. Just because something didn't work once doesn't mean it won't work at all.

Also, if someone is giving you shit for being more confident, you should probably seriously question that person's integrity. Personally, any good change my friends want to undertake I see as good and I want to foster it. If someone asks you why you're acting confident all of a sudden, straight up tell them ""I'm trying to be more confident."" If they ask why, tell them that confidence and success are one in the same, you need some form of confidence to be successful, and you want to be successful. 

In rhetoric, that kind of argument is pretty solid. For example:

1. I want to be confident because confidence yields success. 

2. Success is good 

3. Confidence yields success

4. Therefore confidence is good. 

5. In summation, I want confidence because confidence is good and success is good. 

If the person you're with disagrees with that, you don't need to be around them. They probably like the fact that you're lacking confidence and don't want you to gain it. Even if that person is the best friend you have, your friendship may be based upon a power imbalance that the person likes, and that's not something you want to stay in. "

A view that only developed as a result of thousands of years of women meekly putting up with their ""oppression.""  One wonders why it took so long for women to resist.  One wonders why when the ""patriarchy"" was just beginning to develop, women didn't smother in its cradle.  Why was it allowed to develop for so long?

You can make up excuses why women took 40,000+ years to ""throw off"" the shackles of ""male oppression,"" but you can't change the reality that opressing women appears to be *remarkably* easy and takes almost *no effort at all* because women are such gleeful and willing participants in their own subjugation.

Or maybe, just maybe, your entire version of history, and all your stupid, inane theories, are just **wrong**.  Maybe your entire worldview is just stupid and fucked up.

Maybe I'm just mocking the tremendous misogyny at the root of your own worldview.  Fuck, that would be a mind-blower.

I'm just taking the arguments feminists make about how and why women are oppressed and following them to their inevitable conclusion:  women are pathetic, weak, easily manipulated, mindless slaves to the whim of society, whose agency and individuality can be easily crushed and destroyed, and who can never have equality unless men agree to engage in massive amount of social engineering and make a society wide effort to suppress boys and prop up women.

I don't need biotruths or theredpill to make those arguments.  Just give me a copy of Suan Brownmiller's *Against Our Will* and a highlighter and I'll show you how feminists believe women are pathetic."

Orchid might not be the best item mana-wise, but it still gives you plenty of mana regen. You can still do a bunch of zipping around with it, that's not exclusive to Bloodstone. 

The reason you get Orchid is because of what it does for you on top of the mana/intelligence gain. You get attack speed, which is essential for performing the Storm Spirit attack-&gt;skill-&gt;attack-&gt;skill-&gt;etc chain. You get attack damage, which is great since a large portion of your damage is coming from your right-click. Most importantly, you get a silence that amplifies damage, which makes you an incredible ganker that can render most targets helpless.

You then take the advantages that the Orchid gives you and use it to farm a Bloodstone off the enemy team."

&gt;I cant figure out what theyre doing that makes them interesting to girls.

It is not about what *you* are doing, it is about how you make girls *feel*.  Now, different girls are emotionally attracted to different things.

I have instant attraction to a guy who is funny and who finds me funny.  Someone I can banter with.  Someone who teases me.  Now on top of this I have to feel that they really like me and also having good social graces are a total plus.

This is it for me.  Now of course, whether or not I will consider them for a relationship depends on more things (I don't care how funny you are, if you kick puppies, I won't like you).

I have had the most attractive, successful, fascinating guys interested in me and I wasn't interested.  Some other girl may have melted.  

So, you can't fake it, but you can change your focus from *you* to *the interaction.*  Just, are you having fun together?

mrpoopistan,TheRedPill,1390258096.0,"&gt; Actresses, dancers, performers, musicians, and other skilled folks at the National level make a decent amount, so why not cheerleaders?

People who believe this are too stupid to understand basic economics. And when I say this, I mean the really, really old Adam Smith stuff.

I remember years ago reading Wealth of Nations and coming across a remark about how certain jobs are set to the pay they get. And a lot of the emphasis was on the risk of failing at the job relative to the amount of time you put into learning it. If it's hard to do and there's lots of risk of failure, you're going to get paid better if you succeed.

Think of the guy from the ghetto who's trying to do the rap game. It's a shitload of effort for very little likelihood of becoming Jay-Z. In truth, even if you play the rap game right, it just buys you into a more complex game where everybody is going to shake every penny you have out of you. Consequently, if you pull it off, you get to be Jay-Z. The downside is that if you don't pull it off, you get to be a drug dealer with a shitty studio who's eventually going to be arrested.

The thing with cheerleading and porn is how much work do you put into them? How much risk is there at the next level that someone is going to tear you down? 

Not much. Either you're attractive and can handle certain fundamental parts of the job or you can't. The cost of training you is negligible. The cost of separating you from the herd of wannabes is meaningless -- auditions are held all the time for both industries.

There's lots of demand for the job, there's little downside if you don't make it, there's little downside if you do make it, and there's no real market forces operating to limit supply, drive up prices, or to really cause anything resembling a market to emerge.

&gt;  I'd claim that both NFL cheerleader and male porn star salaries are not just low, but surprisingly low.

I'm amazed that they're paid at all. The NCAA has managed to figure out a way to pull it off with athletes.

NFL cheerleaders are basically being paid a ""one-dollar contract"". Their pay is basically enough to cover any legalities that might arise should one of them be sawed in half during the the pre-game warm-ups and the insurance people freak out.

Male porn stars . . . the only thing that creates demand at all is the specific need for:

1) guys who don't ejaculate within 30 seconds of sticking it in a porn goddess

2) guys who can actually get a female porn star revved up

3) guys who can stay in decent shape

If it weren't for those three factors, there'd be nothing to drive the price up above a dollar."

Clen is easily sold as a research chemical, so you can find it on any of these sort of sites. When it comes to T3, again there are a bunch of sites out there. People recommend getting the pills because they are more precisely measured, but I went with the liquid any ways because it's like 1/3 the price. 

If I were you, I'd stick with just Clen since you will still be working out. T3, is only useful with anabolics since by it's nature it wants to also eat away muscle. "

(obviously excluding trolls who aren't interested in actual discussion)

again, i'm not saying it's a totally apt comparison, and perhaps being more specific will help. say comparable to gonorrhea, a curable, mostly harmless std. if we follow the analogy, one that may (or may not) have short term effects, but is very unlikely (though possible) to have long lasting consequences.

My biggest issue is that I want to still have curls in my hair. Maybe way later along the line.. my dad and I have very similar hair, and when his hair is curly, it makes him look very nice. (Everyone says I am the female version of my dad.)

I like the second version better, as it's more elegant. There's a way to fix the issue you mentioned:

&gt; Secrecy {cost} *(You may cast this spell face-down by paying any amount of mana. Turn it face-up as it resolves. If {cost} could be paid by some amount of, or all of, the mana you paid, it resolves. Otherwise, counter it.)*

I know guys who own wells, and OMFG is that business dirty as shit. They have these wonderful conditional contracts that they use to sit property owners out and try to pressure them into selling the whole lease.

Basically, they come onto the property, set up everything they need to attach a well to a reserve. Usually the contract stipulates that the property owner gets 1% of the total contract at this point -- just enough that you're now fucking married to them for life.

Then they hold onto a whole portfolio of those wells in perpetuity without developing. Maybe they activate a few if demand get hype, but in truth the natural gas industry spent 2012 and 2013 turning off wells to keep prices up.

It's a business where the big boys know how to screw the little guys. No room for speculation at all."

In my experience, a wizard blows his or her spell list too quickly, and the familiar/arcane bond/spellbook can be a hindrance.  A sorcerer seems limited by a small spell list, but if you pick the right spells and pick up a few wands or scrolls, you'll do fine.  (The right spells are buffs, crowd control, and utility! Melee far surpasses casters in terms of damage output in PF, so buff them and just have something on hand that you can hit with when needed.)"

Necron_Overlord,TheBluePill,1390258737.0,"&gt;At the end of the day, the main thought on my mind when encountering one is, ""jesus, what the fuck happened to you to make you this way?""

I grew up in the 80s and was force fed a steady diet of pop feminism that assured me that girls were smarter and more competent than boys in every possible way if only boys would step out of the way.  Every cartoon I watched as a kid had their special episode with the message *girls can do everything boys can do, and they can do it better!* 

And then I grew up and it turned out that girls were, for the most part, every bit as stupid and incompetent as boys, but less responsible, more entitled, and with a strong predisposition towards narcissism and being boring, tedious fuckwits.  But, unlike boys, I have to treat all of you like you're actually worth a shit.  It's frustrating, because the vast majority of you are just boring, tedious, self-involved losers who really don't deserve any to be treated as anything but sad jokes.

Every rare once in awhile I meet a woman who isn't a complete shithead, but most of you are just way too fucking self-righteous and self-important to ever make the slightest attempts to pull your heads out of your asses and be worthwhile human beings.

So, basically, I'm just trying to be a counter-point to your bullshit.  To this bullshit idea that all women are inherently worthy of respect just because.  You're not.  Most of you are just the female equivalents of neckbearded, fedora wearing losers, and you should be subjected to the same amount of scorn, abuse, humiliation and social rejection that those dumb fuckwits are.

When women start waking up to that fact, and stop operating on the assumption that having a twat makes you worthy of special treatment (which most of you are neither self-aware enough nor honest enough to acknowledge), and stop pretending that the basic human respect you think you deserve isn't a special privilege you demand on the basis of gender, then maybe I'll stop insisting that woman are inherently weak and can't hack it without men agreeing to voluntarily limit themselves.

aidenr,magicTCG,1390258860.0,"A few small improvements can probably be made here to really put some zoom into the deck. There are some synergies that won't change the price of the deck but will definitely smooth it out.

First, I don't think that the Merfolk is a good trade-off of time versus devotion count. 3 devotion and a card is good, but you would never want to spend two turns playing a pair. Let's get more Utopia Sprawl effect instead, using Fertile Ground.

Change: -2 Wistful Selkie, +2 Fertile Ground

Next, Joraga Treespeaker is actually pretty slow in this formulation of the deck. Since one of the totally unfair things you'll be doing is abusing the new legendary and planeswalker rules (Tap Nykthos, untap with Arbor Elf, tap Nykthos, +1 Garruk, tap Nykthos, play Garruk sac Garruk, +1 Garruk, tap Nykthos, play Nytkthos sac old one, tap new Nykthos) for 2-5x devotion per turn. Joraga is just mana-more and doesn't really recover from a wipe. Eternal Witness is the scariest thing you can do in this deck, recurring whichever of those components gets you more taps of the devotion land.

Change: -4 Joraga Treespeaker, +4 Eternal Witness

I don't like Khalni Hydra because it doesn't have haste or smash the board like Craterhoof Behemoth. With that as your finisher, I'd trim out one Primeval Titan, Stomping Ground, and Kessig Wolf Run. Instead, I'd aim for a real hard hitting two drop to buy you some time. Strangleroot Geist is great here.

Change: -2 Khalni Hydra, -1 Primeval Titan, -1 Stomping Ground, -1 Kessig Wolf Run, +3 Strangleroot Geist, +2 Craterhoof Behemoth

Finally, to bring your deck up to 60 cards, I would add four free devotion cards:

Change: +4 Burning Tree Emissary

Together, these should give you way better odds of winning. If you wanted to go with one Temple Garden, I could also see injecting a single Village Bell-Ringer. He just loves Genesis Wave and Craterhoof Behemoth.

Hypothetical change: -1 Forest, -1 Burning Tree Emissary, +1 Temple Garden, +1 Village Bell-Ringer"

Also, your whole argument is based off the idea that these people never give or don't want to give, but studies have shown that non-progressives actually donate much larger quantities of money than those who espouse heavy taxes in the name of charity.
The fact of the matter is, when you *force* someone to give in the name charity or morality, there is no practical difference between you and a religious organization imposing its will on all those in its path. Is giving to charity moral and right? Of course it is, but when you use force to make someone give up money simply because *you* believe that is what's right, you're no different than the old Catholic church forcing people to pay tithes. After all, *you* know what is right and wrong, and as the all knowing, benevolent person you are, it is your job to ""show"" people the virtues of giving... at the end of a rifle barrel. 

If you want people to donate to charity or help others, that's great. And do what you can to help those in need and encourage others to do the same. But when you determine that someone who has already given more money in taxes and charity than you will ever see in your lifetime, an amount of money that is three times that given by the entire middle class, should be forced to give simply because ""they don't need it,"" you have entered the dark world of statism. And when entered, there is no stopping point. The entire statist world is based on false premises, emotions and changing rules that have no reliance on truth or fact or reality.

Mr_JK,soccer,1390259096.0,"I don't think Ribery deserved the Ballon D'Or. The Ballon D'Or is an **INDIVIDUAL** award based off **INDIVIDUAL** stats. Not off of who won how many championships. If it was based off of championships then Sneijder should have won the award a couple years back. Ronaldo won because this year he had the best individual stats and that's why he deserved to win. For the Ballon D'Or to mean anything FIFA must stay consistent as to how they award the golden ball and they have.

On the world XI I think FIFA have made a mistake. Players like Ramos, Xavi, Iniesta, and Alves were not the overall best in their respective positions. The Bayern midfield was by far better in 2013, their game in Champions league against Barca proved it. This is what I believe the team should have been.

**Forwards (3)**

1) Ronaldo

2) Messi

3) Ribery


**Midfield (3)**

4) Robben

5) Schweinsteiger

6) √ñzil


**Defense (4)**

It seems to speak to the old and comforting idea that we all have some sort of purpose in life. That we have a singular thing that will give unimaginable meaning to our lives. Something I think Mr. King experienced.

Though I think he's wrong; I'm not simply living to eventually serve one great cause or one big issue. I'm living for a lot of things and I put myself into them equally; and it would be a disservice to myself and my other goals to devote my life to one of them. This quote seems to insult that, as if wanting to live longer and not devote yourself entirely to a singular cause means your worthless or that you've made the wrong decision.

Also the ""date playing guitar"" always felt awkward to me.  So, he is playing.  Am I supposed to stare in to his eyes?  I just sit there with a frozen smile on my face.  ""That was great, wooow...Oh, another song...okay"" more smiling...

It pretty much is a one-sided deal and turning the girl into an audience.  Like, I have no other role than to sit here silently then praise you.   I realize that some women may have different ideas about it though.

Just because you don't have evidence of whether you're right or wrong does not necessarily mean you are one or the other.  With that said, the default assumption for all hypotheses should be false, and all evidence (or gaps thereof) taken into account according to validity.

Extending this to the current topic: the fact the children of Fatima do not decompose cannot be evidence of god in and of itself because there is no logical argument linking the evidence to the conclusion, just as the gaps in the fossil record cannot be a very strong argument against evolution since you cannot logically draw the conclusion that since we have not found it, it does not exist, especially considering the factors at play (how much resources we put into archaeology, how long we have been looking, the difficulty of finding intact fossils etc).

A person could easily argue that the creator created materials that would produce a carbon dating schema as we see (""to disguise its influence"" is the argument I have heard most often).

Let me put it another way for you. A scientific theory is falsifiable - it makes predictions for measurements/observations that, if not observed, disprove the theory. Creationism is not scientific because it is not falsifiable - ""the creator did it that way (because X)"" is the answer to absolutely any possible observation.

In very particular subsets of creationism, some people have interpreted religious scripture to describe exactly how the creator created things. Those aspects are certainly testable, but you have to be more clear about your question if you want to know about that. None-the-less, general creationism can always reason non- or counter-observations away as in ""we read the scripture wrong, it really actually means Y""."

My argument is that entire classes of people shouldn't be judged or hated based on their gender.

3. Breathe.  Take a moment to figure out how to move on from here.  What needs to be said, what needs to be cleaned up, who needs to give and get an apology.

When I'm just generally feeling impatient with the children I usually explain that ""my ears are tired and they need a rest time.

Furthermore, there are some practical limitations to what you can accomplish in a school. It's not a trivial task to create and execute a bunch of different courses of study.

piratelibrarian,AskReddit,1390259669.0,"""Little boys get high on bird bones."" ~ my cousin when we were 11 or so. I'm pretty sure he was trying to be punny.

When my mum was in uni, she decided to go on a bit of a bender with some friends the weekend before finals. My sister and I stayed at one friends' home for the night and mum stumbled her way into the room I was sleeping in and crashed. A while later, she sat straight up and started muttering about Freud and Lacan, etc and gesticulating wildly until she exasperatedly blurted out ""fuck 'em! They're all dead anyway!"" and went back to sleep.

I have a tendency to do things in my sleep, particularly if I've been drinking. After one party, I crashed in my bestie's room and awoke the next morning to find that I had rearranged it. The bed was in the middle of the room, her clothes were ""put away"" (not in any way that made sense, etc. I remember dreaming that I was looking for something special to her and that I thought it would be nice if I could find it and get her room in order as she'd let me sleep in it and all.

At some point during the first night I spent with my current lover, I decided to get up, remove my socks and stuff them behind his phone and try to read a beginner's guide to Python. "

I'm curious to see what the latest GT looks like; I manually added it to Unleashed for a while before eventually deciding that it just wasn't worth the effort given the changes. This was, however, before he'd implemented the full bronze age stuff, and before the experimental IC2 builds. Can you recommend a pack (on the FTB or ATLauncher, hopefully), that shows off the latest version of GT well?

Or do you just drop it in as-is to Monster or something?  Are there any config changes needed, or any sources for up-to-date configs for GT that make sure it cooperates well with otherm mods?"

This past Halloween, I went to a superhero themed costume party at a club in DC dressed as Deadpool. The club is located next to another club so, when leaving, it wasn't uncommon to see people in superhero costumes mixed in with people dressed in normal clubbing attire. 

As I'm walking down the street to get to my car, a girl is stumbling while walking in the same direction. Apparently her friends were waiting for her at their car across the street and she was a little blitzed. When the light turned green, I picked her up and carried her across the street to her friends.

With his new cd reducing passive, once he has some innate cdr in his build he can easily pop his ult to push the lane and via auto attacks + spamming his other skills and autos on minions and monster camps he can take it back off of cooldown very quickly. 

I use this if I have like 30 seconds on my ult cooldown and feel I'll need it soon for a teamfight (Beat on wraiths a bit, move in), and when pushing and farming it'll always be up before the next fight as long as you pay attention. A full cycle of passive procs and auto attacks can reduce 8 seconds of cooldown off his ult if you use it first, plus the time it takes to go through his skill cycle.

Pretty neat stuff. He feels a lot less like a one-dazzle-wonder to me now, which I love.

I love the self-assured snark and sense of superiority that drips from this person's post.  ~~Boring~~ Heterosexual people aren't boring, that's not what I mean, I just mean that the most special of snowflakes (read: people who have utterly nothing systemic to complain about) following the Tumblr SJW pattern have at the very least learned well how to act the part of oppressed.  Bonus points for incorporating the word 'queer' into this.  I would say that it isn't serious but it's simply too well-crafted and phrased for that, I get the distinct feeling like this is a serious thought pattern that someone had, that you can be queer without feeling any sense of romantic or sexual attraction to your same sex or gender.

**Almost kill a PC.**  Real early in the game, put a PC in a totally awful, helpless situation.  You're doing a haunting, right?  Something like the PC gets into an elevator.  It starts filling up with blood.  Keep describing how high it is: at his ankles, the knees, then chest, then neck, all the while he's struggling to solve the ""puzzle"" to escape the trap.  His face is two inches from the ceiling, sucking every precious breath.  Then have him roll stamina to hold his breath, keep doing it over and over until he drowns.  Describe drowning.  DING.  He's arrived at his floor.  There is no blood.  He was hallucinating. 

**Then kill a PC.**  Most GMs don't like to kill their PCs.  You need to resist the temptation to go easy.  Especially in the final confrontation, someone should probably die.  Ideally, you put them in a situation where their fate is sealed unless a sacrifice is made, then let the bravest player volunteer.

**If the heroes confront the monster, they lose.**  No amount of balls can win them the day.  If they see the thing, they need to run.  Whatever they need to do to stop the monster, it isn't guns, bravado, or a conversation.

**Mystery blends well with horror because they are both about the unknown.**  The PCs can't stop the thing until they learn about it, but the closer they get, the worse it gets for them.  What they need is in the basement.  What else is in the basement?  Probably rusty bear traps or a piano with human fingers for keys.

**The PCs are all alone.**  Anytime the PCs try to bring in outside help, the help doesn't believe them or they get killed for getting involved.

**WTF IS THAT??**  Insert something simple, the simpler the better, that it weird and has no obvious explanation.  Like the PCs start being followed by cats.  At first just one, but by the end, every stray just follows them everywhere they go.  Are they spies for a demon?  Are we cursed?  WTF is going on???

Or a little meaner version: A PC interviews an old woman at the hospital, she freaks out and bites him.  The next day, he starts developing some spotty discoloration in the area.  Then the players just guess until they freak themselves out.  *Is he turning into a zombie??  A werewolf??  Is he gonna die???  Should we cut his arm off??*"

That was why I pointed out the thing with nurses and ambulance drivers and telegraph operators. You didn't see women giving feathers to younger women for not volunteering as nurses, even though there were often so many wounded that the nursing crews on the front lines were simply not able to keep up. And shaming others into risking their lives under terrible conditions when you know that it would never ever be asked of YOU is still a bad thing to do.

The fact that in this context ""a romantic candle-lit dinner"" is a cliche in our culture is really the end of the discussion.  Its a cliche because the majority believes theres a romantic connotation.  being a majority held belief, its very likely that the guy in questions likely believes the same.  

So going back to the actual question of the thread, including candles has a chance of adding a romantic context where there is none.  This isn't an absolute, but if she's looking to avoid sending that signal at all costs, then something as simple as not lighting some candles is a no-brainer."

So have I.  Those men were called stupid, obnoxious losers and are treated like shit.  When women like that get treated like shit, we get feminism!  We get you twats and this forum, with your dissembling bullshit and your self-delusion.

Built ""like a 'frigerator with a head"" to quote Jim Croce. You won't always fill people's ideal picture of beauty, but there's someone out there who thinks you're gorgeous.

All you can do is continue to work out, and if you do, you'll do nothing but get stronger and better looking. Hit it, and hit it hard. I don't lift to impress people, or look good. I do it because it makes me healthier, and, and the end of my run in this mortal coil, I want to be able to look back and say to myself: ""I got as strong as I possibly could with the body I was given."" 

To end, I submit to you one of my main motivators - a quote from Socrates. ""It is a shame for a man (or woman, as it were) to grow old without seeing the strength and beauty of which his body is capable."" If you keep that in mind, you don't need anything else. Hit it hard, sister. Keep going, and let the sound of the iron drown out the haters."

1. Congress creates bonds through the Treasury.
2. Said bonds are sold to banks.
3. Banks liquidate bonds to the Federal Reserve.
4. Banks use money given to them by the Fed to pay the Treasury
5. Treasury moves the currency to government branch accounts.
6. Income tax is used as collateral against this debt to pay interest to the Fed.
7. As currency flows to banks, fractional reserve banking kicks in and exponential amounts of currency are created.

nostalgicBadger,INTP,1390260885.0,"My impression of this graph is that, honestly, it tells us very little. 

One big problem is the ambiguity created by ""household income"". If Johnny is an INFJ and I'm an INTP, and he and I both take home the same salary, but he marries someone with about the same income, while I don't marry at all, then it's going to look like INFJs make twice as much as INTPs. The income of your partner, or whether you even have a partner, is going to impact your household income significantly.

Another issue I see is that they probably used a straight mean, which might be deceptive in this case. I've noticed a ton of engineers and software developers in this subreddit. These aren't typically low paying jobs -- sure, there are ways to make more money, but assuming we can divide household income by two to find an individual income, the average INTP is making around $32k? A competent software developer should have no problem making twice that, and an engineer could be making even more. So what if, hypothetically, half of INTPs are making $64k / year and the other half are unemployed? The mean would come out to $32k, but that number on its own wouldn't really tell us anything about what the individual INTP is making.

Don't get me wrong: I think it's cool that somebody put the charts together, but I'd much rather have the raw data to play with; I think much more compelling interpretations could be found than what's being presented here."

add_problem,short,1390260923.0,"&gt; So you don't put men on a pedestal but you talk earlier about the male gender wearing you down as if we're one entity.


The only reason it wears me down is that I don't understand why exactly it is that men seem to think they're too good to associate with me.  I am well aware that men are superficial, easily distracted by sex, and cannot be expected to pull their weight in a home.  A lot of men lack the skills needed to be emotionally supportive.  Most men require extensive ""training"" on what they need to do to be responsive to their partner's needs (to be fair it *IS* different for a lot of people), and require prompting that a lot of women don't to remember birthdays/anniversaries/valentines.




&gt;what do you mean beneath your friends? are your friends perhaps more attractive than you? i'm hesitant to say it has anything to do with looks since even non attractive girls (and I have no idea where you fall) have male friends. If you want to wait and what you bring in the table is average at best i'm not sure why you feel it's BS to say you shouldn't wait around like your friends. i'm friends with a guy who is 6'3 and gets cold approached while i have never been cold approached and had to do all the legwork myself and i don't think it's BS. that's just life.


I've been told by amiugly that I am at least average looking, so theory should follow that I should get some interest from guys who are below average since women typically do not garner attention from men more attractive than they are.  No luck there."

Lithuim,explainlikeimfive,1390260993.0,"Once the two objects get close enough they'll start to deform under the other's gravity.

If an object is so close that its gravity is greater than Earth's it will tear the planet apart.  There's nothing but gravity holding the Earth together.

This happens frequently in the cosmos, when a small object passes too close to a much larger object it can get shredded by tidal forces and form a debris field around the bigger object.

Moons, planets, and even stars have been destroyed by venturing too close to a much more massive object.

If two massive objects actually slammed into eachother instead of getting into an orbital death spiral it'd look more like two giant water balloons full of magma in slow motion.

The force of impact would melt both objects and they'd merge or shatter.

Earth's moon was formed from debris ejected during a major collision event, metallic asteroids are remnants of planetessimals that were hit so hard they exploded into fragments."

I got them at FastTech, Bucky's Bargain Vaping, and a local B&amp;M chain store called UniqueCigs respectively.

*Edit:*  Side note for full disclosure, I don't own a Kayfun clone yet, but I know a couple people that do.  I'm fairly new to building, only been doing it for 2 or 3 months...  They're even newer than that and have had some really nice KFL builds.  I wish I got an ehpro KFL+ clone instead of my Fogger and will probably be picking on up soon from eciggity.  There are lots of stores out there, and only Bucky's has shown service to make me consider loyalty... But his prices aren't particularly low.

*Another edit:* I know you want VV/VW, so the Astro and Kylin are not for you...  And I do NOT recommend an SVD.  Mine lasted about 3 months before the button got soft, and others report button issues too."

You make the point below that it's your choice where your want to be touched, yes - but society has deemed things that are ok, are sometimes ok and are not ok in public/without consent. So I can tap your shoulder from behind to get your attention, I can probably touch your elbow while flirting, I can't really grab your junk without enthusiastic consent. If your lines are different from society's that's something you have to deal with, not society. The west has deemed men's chests as relatively non-sexual, so you can't expect people to act like your chest is different. 

I would say this is inherently untrue. Men's chest's are considered sexual (just go over to askwomen and look at the responses to what is attractive on a guy), the difference is it is acceptable to expose them. But they are undoubtedly considered sexual by many. "

There are, of course, downsides.  For a long time I spent way too much time on Reddit, to the point where it would take over several hours of every day.

Also, it seems to just do a detection on one source of potential evil, since it's classified as Ranged and not a Burst or Blast, and there's no ""target"" denomination.

Also, Detect Evil is an awful, terrible idea and leads to whitewashing of characters on the basis of a parameter that is only useful as a guide and has no mechanical implications. You knock out most people's desire to play an Evil-aligned character by making this an in-game possibility, and that limits your character archetypes to 60% of the listed types.

Also! Be aware that if you allow a Detect Evil effect, and people decide they don't want Evil stuff anywhere, you basically have a genocide either in your world's history or about to happen very soon.

aprofondir,AskReddit,1390261459.0,"Serbian Christmas.

See, every house needs to choose their honored guest from a friend family

It needs to be a male

How does that go?

I'll explain

See, on christmas eve, a family goes to another family with an apple

And they ask them for their son to be their honored guest

So in the christmas morning

The family cant eat anything until the guest comes

When he goes in through the door, he throws seed (corn, wheat, whatever he has) at the family

The more he spills, the more luck the family will have during the year

(Its a symbol, for wheat fields n shit)

So he goes to the stove with an apple that has coins in it

Usually about a few bosnian markas

So he opens the stove and starts saying some nice things

Like, ""all the sparks shall become money and cattle and hapiness""

Im not joking

So he puts the apple on the stove and eats with the family

A special type of bread is made, with following things hidden in it

A coin, a bean, a corn and a piece of wood

So, the dad of the family takes that bread (which is not like an usual bread, its weird) and breaks it into pieces, over the youngest child's head

But not aggressively, it needs to be slow

It's hard to say why companies haven't tried it other than that its uncharted territory. It's worth noting that even purely single-player hack n' slash games haven't been all that common lately. There might some balancing issues which have prevented potential projects from getting off the ground. Co-op horde-like modes actually have been tried (see Ryse and God of War: Ascension) but those multiplayer modes weren't very well received and don't have very large communities around them. Likewise, with publishers cutting corners everywhere they can, and with the undeniable fact that the time of the players is scarce and they seem to be spending it playing the quintessential multiplayer games like shooters, MOBAs, and MMOs. There's the possibility of some kind of paradigm shift in the market, but pursuing it is risky and ever since the financial crisis companies have been more risk-adverse than usual."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390261568.0,"Well, here's something that happened to me that might show why it would be helpful...

I had moved with my SO across the US because she was going to grad school.  It's where I always wanted to live, so it wasn't a big deal to me - in fact, I was super excited about it.  It wasn't so much about moving to be with her as it was for me to be in the place where I wanted to be. I was going to stay with her (she had a place set up) until I found a job and a place for myself to live.

Well, after being there for about a month, she broke up with me.  It was incredibly hard on me - I had no one there that I knew, hadn't yet found a job (and therefore, a place to live)...I pretty much had nothing, and I was staying with my now ex girlfriend on top of that.  Not exactly the best time of my life.

So anyway, I call up some friends to talk because it's how I sort of reason things out and feel better when things go poorly.  We talked about how things weren't exactly perfect for a while, and he opened my eyes up to the fact that we had more issues than I realized, and that maybe I should have seen things coming, but my comfort in the relationship prevented that realization.  What's cool is all my friends give very different perspectives, which all add to my overall understanding.

But probably the absolute best thing that came out of it was I got a job a day later that I promptly turned down because I was planning on coming home.  I had planned on at least moving out there with someone, and since I had no one, it wasn't worth it to me anymore.  I call up my friend, explain what happened, and he reminded me how pissed off I would be at myself when I got home if I didn't stay.  I called up the job, got the job back, found a place to live in 3 days, and moved out in a week.  Once I moved and started working, I had never been so happy in my life.  It was the best decision I had ever made, but if I hadn't had my friend talk me through it, it wouldn't have happened.  I would have moved home and been pissed off with myself with almost no way of getting back out there yet.

So that's my story.  Are you caught up on the word ""feelings""?  You don't want to talk about them specifically, but what about the things surrounding the feelings?  When I called my friends, I didn't say, ""I'm sad, I feel hurt, I'm in a bad place, etc.""  I instead said things like, ""Well, she broke up with me.  I don't really see much reason to stay here right now, so I think I'm just going to look for plane tickets and find a way home.""  Then we end up talking about what happened and what my options are.  The conversation may circle around the feelings themselves, but that's certainly not the focus."

radeky,nfl,1390261667.0,"Making everything challengable seems like a bad idea.  Being able to challenge for say a holding call that would overturn any play could be ridiculous, as coaches would just start telling their guys to look for bad calls to overturn.

At any rate, what I mean by the whistle is say a guy fumbles as he's going to the ground, but the referee whistles it dead.  Play is dead once he blows the whistle.  Say you notice the fumble, challenge on it but how do you determine who possessed the ball at the moment the whistle was blown?  What about position?  Perhaps the guy who recovered it could have run it in for a touchdown?

Those questions are why referees will let the game continue, and then later review it.  Some things need to be reviewable always, like anytime a fumble occurs whether or not the original team recovered it.

But by letting the game continue, we end up with these piles as players try to recover the fumble, because the play is still going (as far as they know).

I don't know that I have a solution for that problem other than to use the guys in the booth to make the call as to what gets reviewed and what doesn't in those situations."

The only thing is that once I started to get seriously into powerlifting, my ankles would sometimes roll out a bit (not visibly, but I could feel some pressure on them) during the squat. What the Oly shoes do is give you a more sturdy foundation, it feels almost like bolting your feet to the floor. It makes you more comfortable during a lift and helps you really land solidly while catching a snatch or clean. Definitely not a necessary purchase, but nice to have if you are a serious lifter."

I am not telling you what to believe. I am just trying to describe the difficulty with arguing the two perspectives. Each one uses different criteria to determine it and disregards the criteria of the other.

Empiricism uses empirical observation to make statements about X. Theology and philosophy use logic to make statements about X. But the logic is always based on a set of premises which are easily attacked, while empiricism always results in an infinite string of questions of more and more details of why and how."

Her breath was already a thick fog in front of her face even though it wasn't nearly as cold as it would become by full nightfall. A cave peeked from behind several trees. At last, some sort of shelter.

With the fading light she gathered a heap of branches for a fire. As the sun began to slip behind the horizon she found herself sitting before a pile of sticks that simply would not catch on fire. Shivering wracked her body while her eyes attempted to shut themselves due to exhaustion.

A looming figure appeared from the shadows. A great hairy abomination that could only be one thing. ""No,"" was the only word able to escape her lips before firm, warm, hairy arms enveloped her.

To me, Rutgers football is a program that has been on a pretty steady upswing for a long time.  They have their stumbles, but they have been chugging along and getting consistently better for years.  I think them being added to the B1G will only make them stronger.  They might take a little while while they get used to B1G football, but they will definitely get a lot better.

It shows several Wisps, Greater Wisps, and Elder Lemurians running around inside the cargo bay. But wait... how did they get on the ship in the first place? They're natives to the planet, and the monster logs for the Lemurians speak of how they move through subterranean tunnels. They shouldn't have been on the ship at all... unless the Contact Light *did* steal a teleporter and they all came onto the ship using it (note that the subject of teleportation is brought up in the Imp monster log, with the survivor expressing his incredulity at the Imp possibly succeeding biologically where mankind has always failed technologically).  

This is a really smart theory and a good catch, OP. I had never noticed the teleporter in the cargo bay.  

Ninja-edit: Something else just occurred to me. The fact that Wisps are on the Contact Light is extremely telling. Remember their monster log? ""While I've seen 'deactivated' masks all around this world,the only time I've spotted Wisps is around me, as if someone creates them specifically to kill me..."" They were on that ship on purpose."

Join a team. Actually, join cross country or a swimming team. The people are amazing and you get incredibly fit in just one season if you put your effort in.

Since you wanna get muscular I wouldn't do nearly as much cardio as I do. Do weight training, probably get a gym membership. It's gonna be really hard at first if you don't already exercise regularly. It's gonna suck to go to the gym and sweat buckets with no visible improvement to revel on for the first month or so. But it'll get better, you'll get better. Set goals for yourself. Achieving these goals and setting personal records are major motivators and make you feel crazy awesome. Good luck!

You are taking my comment far too literally, and not figuratively as in intended.  I say you're an idiot, because only an idiot would have failed to recognize it as a figurative statement.

The point is that if men were oppressing women, then there were plenty of ways for women to fight back and discourage such behavior.  The idea that women were powerless to resist male oppression is facile; men are only *moderately* stronger than women, and women have always had easy access to men at their most vulnerable.  No, the reality is either one of two possibilities:  

The first is that feminists are right, and that women were oppressed for almost all of human history, and are still oppressed almost everywhere.  In which case the oppression of women continues primarily due to the unwillingness of women to take real and meaningful action to fight their oppressors, preferring to beg for respect rather than force their oppressors to respect them. 

The second is that the whole theory that women were oppressed for most of human history is just kind of bullshit and is actually based on a very deeply misogynistic view of women and a very misinformed view of history."

It was usually a long process that eventually it would just start dropping and settle at about 90 within a minute or two.

Right now I'm just not sure if this is important to go back to the cardiologist for. Before, he said that it happens somewhat often in teens and that they eventually grow out of it, but that's not really what's bothering me anymore. Well, I suppose it is on a psychological level...

ana48190,offmychest,1390262611.0,Thank you for u that. Everytime I visit here I try to be around her all the time. She has Parkinson's disease-like symptoms but they were never able to find out what was wrong with her. She's 100% mentally there. Even then sometimes I see her break down and cry. I don't know if she's scared or in pain. I can only imagine. It just kills me. My dad explained to me that I should live life for them and that my mom understands. Even hearing those words from him didn't do much. I don't know why I have all this guilt.

He's not the locker room cancer that TO was, in any way. If he caused problems for the team, I'd definitely hate him. He's not the guy who's going to blame all his shortcomings on his team. He got beat pretty bad against Jones/White against the Falcons in the playoffs last year, and simply said ""I have to be better. This is not acceptable."".

&gt; A view that only developed as a result of thousands of years of women meekly putting up with their ""oppression."" One wonders why it took so long for women to resist. One wonders why when the ""patriarchy"" was just beginning to develop, women didn't smother in its cradle. Why was it allowed to develop for so long?
&gt; 
&gt; You can make up excuses why women took 40,000+ years to ""throw off"" the shackles of ""male oppression,"" but you can't change the reality that opressing women appears to be remarkably easy and takes almost no effort at all because women are such gleeful and willing participants in their own subjugation.

For tens of thousands of years, human beings attacked each other with sharpened wood, metal, and stone sticks when they could have just mixed together charcoal and bat guano and produced gunpowder. Why are human beings so stupid? Clearly we are worthless slime. "

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1390262651.0,"You can have a productive philosophy even when you're a miserable, cynical fuck. Last time I heard Kant being brought up around here, he was kind of put down in favor of more nihilistic philosophies, but his deontological ethics are a great example of what I'm talking about.

It's easy to misunderstand, because a core component of RP philosophy being espoused is to ignore social validation. In turn, a large number of ""rules/duties"" are social in nature, which is why a lot of people may be hostile to Kantian philosophy and other deontic ones.

That's where the *categorical imperative* comes in. Not all of our actions need to be defined by how we'll be perceived or rewarded by others. Some of them can even seem ""selfish"", but still motivated to some abstract code/duty or obligation to self. E.g. refusing to commit suicide; also refusing to be abused financially, physically, or emotionally.

This is all highly dependent on one's faith (outside the realm of science/logic), which is why, as Piroko pointed out, Schopenhauer boiled down Kantian ethics to being dependent on the concept of ""God"" (some manner of absolutism). Otherwise, you'll most likely be searching for or trying to understand a *hypothetical imperative* of one kind or another (""because society/women will reward me"", ""because evolution"", etc).

Hate on Jesus and Buddha all you want, but at least they are providing standards for personal integrity and measurement that go beyond social validation and moral relativism.

Even if you are uncertain, and don't have the ""right rulebook"" or the ""right answers"" (I certainly don't), nihilistic philosophies are tautologically useless to have. What matters is that science, technology, the overall breadth of human knowledge is expanding and there's nothing to say that your life goals won't become clearer in the future. Why not have the power (social, financial, and even physical) to act/contribute towards them when the time does come? 

Until then‚Ä¶ Make money. Advance your career. Expand your web of connections. Don't burn bridges. Don't get taken advantage of. There's a big chance you'll find something worth much more than today's romantic relationships, in the future, especially if you're currently angry about the concept.

Dantilli,introvert,1390262772.0,"&gt;  I think my introversion will prevent me from ever being in a serious long term relationship

Remember that a relationship isn't about being around each other all the time and being dependant on each other. It's about two individuals spending time together who have a massive positive influence on each other. If you really like each other and decide to move in and marriage and all that crap, that's fine, but remember that you're still individuals. You're still allowed to have time to yourself. You've just decided that you want to make time for them in your life as well.

So even if you don't expect anything, don't stop looking. Nothing will ever prevent you from having a great relationship (apart from maybe death or inability to communicate). It's all about finding a person that you want to have in your life, that you're willing to make time for (that feels the same way about you).

I've learned in these last few years that relationships are whatever you want them to be, there is only one defining characteristic and that is two people who want to be in each other's lives. So if the standard socially accepted style of relationship isn't your thing, don't be discouraged, just go for a relationship that is right for YOU."

hezec,Finland,1390262957.0,"My mom is a high school maths teacher so I've watched it from the sidelines for quite a while... More recently I've also substituted for her a couple of times. There aren't really any restrictions for that and the school administration is only happy if the teacher can find someone by themselves.

As far as I know, there is no designated preparation time, only scheduled classes. Some 'strategy-level' meetings are held once a month or so. It's all up to the individual, and in the case of perfectionists like my family that can easily mean staying up until 2am preparing slides and making exams. My mom has finally, after 20+ years of experience, started to 'slack' and reuse old material directly, although that's still not always possible because the national curriculum gets updated every so often. On the other hand, she complains how some of her colleagues do barely any preparing and still get the job done. :P

The time spent in class is debatable. In high school (*lukio*, grades 10-12), the school year is typically divided into five periods which each have separate courses and a dedicated exam week at the end. One course usually gets a bit under 4h per week (5x45 or 3x75 minutes, depending on the school). Graduation requires a minimum of 75 completed courses and as high school normally lasts three years with the last spring dedicated to national exams, or 13 periods, that means an average of 6-7 courses per period for a student. My mom says that for a teacher, 5 courses is more reasonable and 7 would be exhausting. That's actually not much more than 4h per day of actual teaching, but of course there's always a bit of setting up and such in the class. (As a student you can do a lot more if you want, though. Some extracurricular activities also count. My school offered a lot of extra maths and science, so I have 96 courses to my name and I know someone who did close to 150!)

Another thing I'll point out from the 'article' is that science classes quite rarely include personal experiments. Usually they're only theory and when not, the teacher will demonstrate something in the front and that's it."

Everything is labelled and organised well, give or take the obvious customer put-back. Employees often ask if I need help finding a size or anything, and often will go find things for me while I'm in try-on.

The actual Nordstrom, which is kind of a midpoint between the two Nord.Racks in that area, seems to also be held up to this standard. The second Nord.Rack, though, does not seem to have a wide a selection or as organised of a layout.

In-store, the only way to know is to go in and check, or possibly to call and ask, since most retail stores can look up product codes and see how many they have in stock. Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack both have online sites you can place orders in (correct me if I'm wrong), but it's not too helpful if you need to try it on before buying it."

the only thing that makes me a little bitter is i know when people look at us they will automatically assume we both ""settled"" or just have ""low standards"" since he's also a tad shorter than me and... a ginger...

when a guy asks which one is hot and starts the ""but... anorexic is hot!"" back and forth nonsense you should correct them firmly and without hesitation. be like ""no man, you're missing the point entirely, that gap is *nasty* and nobody likes grinding pelvic bones... those round thighs and that muffin top is just sexy shit"" and like start going off all jason mews style rant on them with a serious tirade of all the ways chubbiness turns your shit on.

i know lots of guys that like their girls plump to downright round and just can't help themselves. a pretty fair number, really more than you'd think. nothing to be ashamed of! big women used to be revered and worshiped if not the standard of sexy because it made them look more affluent and fit for breeding. nobody says downright obese is healthy (though some do find it still attractive), but some meet on the bones isn't necessarily a bad thing. don't take their shit! the guys or the girls.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390263183.0,"&gt; I trust I would make the right decision.

The problem is your experiences are limited.  Even if you have perfect logic, you aren't necessarily going to choose the best outcome for you.  There are certain things you may not see coming because you haven't been there before.  Or maybe you think someone acted a certain way because it makes sense based on your experiences, but in reality, they acted differently, which can be seen based on someone else's.  I can understand trusting yourself, and I trust my instincts and that I will make the best decision I can as well, but it's only best based on my experiences and knowledge, both of which are limited.  Thinking that I can't possibly make a better decision if I had used the knowledge/experience of others, especially people that I surround myself with who I consider to be very intelligent, would be pretty damn arrogant.  


When relationships are concerned, they're trying to get on the same page so that they can continue to make each other happy without making each other upset.  If my girlfriend does something that makes me upset, if I tell her, then she won't do it again, or will try not to.  If I say nothing she'll continue doing it because she might have no idea.

Mephrael,AskReddit,1390263279.0,"Initial disclaimer: I'm not a ""true"" rap fan, but one thing I can clearly recall seeing was a number of interviews where Eminem took the time to explain how he comes up with passable rhymes for words that are traditionally either very difficult, or arguably impossible to rhyme with. I also respect the fact that the guy is happy enough to take shots at his own image, which to me says that he's not so hung up on himself that he looses perspective. 

Looking in from the outside, it's pretty clear that the rap genre is a fairly egotistical beast, and introspective rappers are a rare commodity. It may well be fair to say that Eminem isn't on the bleeding edge of rap any more, but it's clear from the amount of karma flying around that he has both fans, and divides opinions like he always has."

Where are you getting the assertion that 1 in 4 men are child abusers? I don't see how that logically follows from ""1 in 6 boys have been abused"". That statistic says nothing about the perpetrator or the nature of the abuse. You state that the implication is that it's men doing the abuse (when it could be women) and that each incident is isolated (ie., no repeat offenders). 

If you could clarify what you mean, where this is coming from, and why you assume all the perpetrators are males with no repeat offences (if that is indeed what you're saying) that'd be great."

nostalgicBadger,INTP,1390263353.0,"I think you'd appreciate some of the existential writers/philosophers, who dealt with a lot of these epistemological issues in terms of how they affect us individually. There's some very good existential fiction that's probably more engaging, at least as an introduction, than the more academic work of Kierkegaard, Heidegger, Sartre's essays and so forth. Dostoevsky wrote some of the most thought-provoking novels I've ever read, although if you do decide to read him, I would strongly recommend starting with *Notes From the Underground*, rather than the better, much longer novels. It's not by any means his best work, but it's formative, and he's very explicit about a lot of the ideas that he's dealing with, so your reading of the rest will be better informed. Sartre's essays, as I mentioned previously, are a little dry, but his plays at least are worth a look. As plays go, you might also enjoy *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead* by Stoppard and pretty much anything by Bernard Shaw. Although he tried his best to distance himself from ""existentialism"", I'd also recommend Camus -- at least *The Stranger*. Finally, I think any INTP could appreciate Kafka -- *The Trial* is both one of the funniest and most intellectually engaging books I've ever read.

If belief itself is of interest to you, two others I found while researching occultism who I think are worth reading, even if occultism doesn't especially grab you, are Peter J. Carroll and Robert Anton Wilson. *Quantum Psychology* by the latter explores the extent to which our belief systems influence our perception and, consequently, our experience of the universe, and Peter Carroll was extremely influential in the formation of chaos magic, which treated ""magic"" more as a sort of willful manifestation of the placebo effect, adopting and discarding beliefs according to their usefulness at the time. This probably sounds a bit new agey -- and by all means, approach it with skepticism -- but if nothing else, it makes for an interesting thought experiment.

Also, sorry to go all ""wall of recommended reading"" on you, but this is a subject of particular interest to me, so I wouldn't even know where to begin explaining my own thoughts on the matter."

Now before you go jumping all over me, let me say that I knew they were together, but I also knew that they were one of those ""on-off"" couples, and he told me that they were off at the time. I believed him, because I'm naive as all hell. And basically we only hung out like 3 times, but we texted constantly. And we'd talk dirty and he'd say how bad he wanted to fuck me and all this. Well, when he and his girlfriend got back together he didn't tell me, and we were texting while he was with her. Which was fucking stupid but whatever. So she saw my name on his phone, took his phone and read through our messages. She then sent me a really rude text from his phone (I really don't blame her though), and blocked me from his Facebook and hers and proceeded to tell all her friends what a whore I was.  I kind of felt really bad about it, but at the same time she was such a bitch to me even before all this that I really didn't care later. Now (2 years later) they're still off and on and occasionally he'll unblock me from FB just long enough to send an ""I miss you"" message, then block me again. Fucking man-whore. "

That is also the nature of having a job.

Not to sound too harsh here but I think your expectations might be a bit too high.

It sounds like you are being fatalistic and not very open right now.  If you have *no* job and no real skills, you need to get a life plan. Do you want to go back to school?  Do you want to start your own business?  Whatever you want to do you need a job.

Yes, they can suck.  But a lot is your attitude.  When I worked at the coffee warehouse job I had a Master's degree and a contract that kept getting delayed.  I sucked it up and travelled an hour by public transportation each way to work in a noisy, hot, heavy labor environment.  I made it enjoyable for myself by working hard.  

But it sounds like you need a car so you need to start by just making some money.  Think of it as a step on a ladder.  

Just take a step back: you have no degree, no skills that you have mentioned, minimal experience, no car and you are worried about picking and choosing.  You can get all the things you want but they are not going to be handed to you.

If you knew the amount of shit, miserable jobs I have had.  You do what you need to do.

stillakilla,AskMen,1390263640.0,"Women aren't shit for that.

Very few women want boredom in their life, and if you're going to be the same nice dude to her every single day and tend to her every whim it won't work. 

Dudes need to learn that they're allowed to disagree with their SO's and argue every now and then, and completely challenge what they say if it's not agreed with or else she will get bored. 

They need to be the leader and be alpha about shit or at least equal with their partner and not looking to woman to wear the pants completely. 

There's a difference between treating a woman like a queen in a relationship and being her bitch.

You don't get into relationships to date a clone of yourself that thinks exactly like you, you get into relationships to date someone that gives you joy in life and keeps things interesting and consistently new and fun.


I know this because I made this mistake, and I realized how little I provided to my relationship. I was so boring and made everything so lame that I can't even be mad at my ex for breaking up with me, and I don't beat myself up about it but the truth is that I deserved it.

[Sedimentary Rock](http://i.imgur.com/3w225xZ.jpg) is formed when layers and layers of sediment (eroded rocks/minerals/shells/etc) build up and are compressed, turning into, well, rock. It's rock made of other rocks. 

[Igneous Rock](http://i.imgur.com/lXq3848.jpg) is formed when molten rock cools, essentially. (Magma-molten rock underground, lava is above ground iirc)

[Metamorphic Rock](http://i.imgur.com/AKuJcZy.jpg) is formed when igneous or sedimentary rock is ""morphed"" into a new rock through increased heat and pressure.

RichardBehiel,todayilearned,1390264042.0,"Corollary: The moon always ""points"" in the direction of the sun, if you look at it the right way.  So, for instance, in [this picture](http://www.air-and-space.com/Moon/20061017%20waning%20crescent%20Moon%20l.jpg) the moon would be pointing to the left.  The reason why is pretty obvious if you think about it for a few seconds, but it's still a neat trick.

When the moon's full, it's pointing back at us, and the sun is roughly on the opposite side of the earth (that's why the full moon rises at sunset), and when it's a new moon, it's pointing away from us, and the moon and sun are close to each other from our perspective (hence rising at sunrise).  

Solar/lunar eclipses are just extremely new/full moons, where everything lines up.  This doesn't happen all the time since the moon orbits at about a 5 degree inclination with respect to the earth-sun plane."

Bones Reds are the best bearings for 18$, best bang for your buck.  For griptape go with Mob or Jessup, Mob is stickier and destroys shoes faster but I would rather do better tricks and stick them than have nice shoes.

tjah,Foodforthought,1390264457.0,"I found myself a bit aghast at the, ""wearisome grind that all but defines the human condition,"" I can certainly understand that many people do in fact have a lot of hardships in day to day life. But the idea that life itself is suffering? For many, many people, I should hope more than not, this is simply not true. 

For example, I have a very very good life. I'm by no means the child of a billionaire, set to inherit a fortune that means I will never have to work a day in my life. But I was born in a part of the world, in a period in history, and most importantly, to a family which has influenced me and given me certain advantages that has contributed to me being able to work a job I love, with minimal student loans, a very loving marriage, having good friends and family close by, being able to have fun and fulfilling hobbies. Some of these things are the result of my own doing, but a lot of it are due to circumstances ultimately out of my control. In short, I am extremely lucky. 

I like to think that what helps keep me from developing a spoiled, ""first world problems"" attitude about my life is my awareness that I have a lot to owe to sheer dumb luck. Sure, there are things that get to me; my assignment at work seems unreasonably heavier than my coworkers, I have to work during a friend's birthday, etc, etc. But to pretend that these minor annoyances are the ultimate sufferings seems like it belittles the actual, genuine hardships so many other people in the world go through. To me, ""fine"" seems to sum that up perfectly; sure there are a few things here and there that suck, but for the most part, things are pretty darn awesome. Maybe for the sake of bridging that cultural gap, should I ever meet a Russian, I should pretend life sucks; but I'm struck by the irony of lying so they don't think I'm lying."

mkvgtired,europe,1390264509.0,"The loophole they're talking about uses a combination of European Union, Irish, Dutch (or Swiss, Luxembourgish, etc.) law. Its called a Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich. 

There are benign laws like the EU law that prohibit taxing transfers of funds over borders within the EU. And then there are much more deliberate laws parliaments know are being used to avoid taxes, but they are beneficial to the countries so there is no incentive to change them (besides pressure from outside countries).

It works something like this:

Almost all multinationals have setups like this. European multinationals actually have a slight advantage with this, becasue they can get their income back into the EU tax free (via Irish corporate structure laws). Its called Double Irish with a Dutch (or Swiss, or Luxembourgish) Sandwich.

Here's how it works:

Irish law says a company is headquartered where its principle place of business is, NOT where it is incorporated.

1. IP Holding Company incorporated in Ireland with principle office in the Caymans, Bermuda, etc.

2. Company incorporated in Ireland charged with overseas sales

3. Company incorporated in the Netherlands, hired by 2 to run sales.

So company 2 contracts with company 3 to be in charge of international sales. Because company 3 is a foreign subsidiary in the Netherlands the tax rate is incredibly low. Cash pours into company 3 from overseas sales of multinational's product.

Because Ireland and the Netherlands are both in the EU, cash transfers are not taxed when they go over borders. So all the profits that were not taxed are wire transferred to company 2 in Ireland.

Well Ireland has a 12.5% corporate tax rate, and multinationals certainly dont want to pay that. So company 2 pays most of their profits to company 1 in IP (trademark, copyright, patent) license fees (these are tax deductible business expenses). So now the profit has been transferred to company 1, which would now show a profit.

I know you're thinking that company 1 should still be liable to pay the Irish 12.5% tax. Here's the loophole. Remember Irish law says even though company 1 is incorporated in Ireland, it is *headquartered* in the Caymans because its PPB is there. So under Irish law all these funds can be transferred to the location of the PPB tax free.

Viola, these foreign profits are now sitting in the Cayman Islands virtually tax free. Virtually all multinationals that do business in Europe have a set up like this.

_______________________________________

Aside from that, US tech giants are some of the largest employers in Ireland. So this article does not apply to Ireland at least. Seems to be home base for US tech giants operating in the EU. Part of it is for tax reasons, but given the number of people they employ taxes are clearly not the only factor. "

Yes relationships are complex but sometimes having a complex answer to a complex question isn't always the best thing. I tried to explain it in my own way, cutting down on complex for something easy that might give some new simple light on things and 'ELI5' so to speak. Maybe we see relationships differently and that is really why you didn't like my simple and odd view, who knows. Even though relationships are complicated the GF that sparked this whole thing gave a very simple answer too, ""too nice"". Sometimes relationships aren't complicated but simple and they end for very simple reasons. In that sense my over the top gaming metaphor was complex for such a simple answer the GF gave.

The sun provides 1004 joules/sm^2 at high noon.  That's enough energy to evaporate .44 grams of water per square meter per second.

To get one gallon per second you'll need 8590 square meters of evaporation surface directly exposed to the sun.  That's a 92x92 meter square per gallon assuming 100% conversion to evaporated water.

It's simply not efficient.  The sun alone doesn't provide enough energy to effectively purify large volumes of water unless you actually have the whole ocean's surface at your disposal

Misters and refrigeration units require pumping stations and heat exchangers.

The more surface area you plan to use, the more heat exchangers you'll need to refrigerate.

We build hundred million gallon/day plants because we don't want to have small scale plants every few miles.  It's much more efficient to have several gargantuan facilities than thousands of tiny ones.  You need less equipment, less personnel, and less power distribution infrastructure.

The best bet for solar and wind power is to put those facilities where they're most effective and add their energy to the grid.

The desalination plants can then draw the power they need from the grid and operate conventionally."

That represents around a hundredth of my cost for rent and is less than the cost of taking my wife out for dinner once a month.  Or seeing a movie.

I really only make space planes in KSP, and wanted to design a large, single stage, reusable plane that gets to the Mun and back and functions well both in space and in the atmosphere. 

In the interest of honesty and to avoid being called out, this picture series documents two trips. I got to the Mun successfully and took all those pics, but didn't have quite enough fuel to get back so I made a few minor adjustments (switching Skipper engine to Poodle engine, for one) to the design and ran another quick mission (so the last few pictures are technically of a different craft).

The Concordia is a 6-man crew science and exploration vessel. There is no benefit to having more crew, in fact it makes it less efficient. I just think it's cool. It is 127.1 tonnes at takeoff. All parts are stock, but I use the FAR mod. It is not VTOL capable at takeoff, but lands vertically on the Mun in reduced gravity, and once enough fuel is burned from the trip, can land vertically back on Kerbin.

Taking off is the hardest part of flying this thing, once it's airborne it's a real dream to fly.

We write up a report and send it off to try to stop further scamming. And if we dont, if we let it go, not doing due dilligence or knowing theyre being scammed or we are cashing a fake check, then our financial store/bank/credit union is at risk of fines and our job is likely toast.

By about october, i told Joe that i was trying to build a computer, researching prices and what-not. He started telling me about all the things he knew about PC's and told me to check out some prebuilts from Alienware (because they are so good for gaming /sarcasm). i obviously said they were overpriced and it was a waste of money, especially because they someties skimp on RAM or HDD quality.

When i told him this, Joe was pretty pissed - thinking that i was insulting his PC knowledge or whatever - and he started to try and get me to buy Alienware, like for a month or 2 he would just say ""Alienware"" whenever i was with him.

I've never had ""regular"" stroganoff, as my mother always cooked a version that relied very heavily on sour cream, but this tastes somewhat similar.  It's got more of a focus on the beef flavor really.  

Serves 5 (not including noodles or rice)  
1 pkg of super firm, cubed tofu   
2lb mushrooms, sliced  
2 onion, diced  
2tbsp butter  
2 beef stock cubes, made up in 4 cups hot water  
4tbsp tomato ketchup    
6tsp paprika  
6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced  
10 tbsp sour cream (heaped) (I used low fat sour cream for obvious reasons)  
Handful fresh parsley, chopped  
In a large pan, melt the butter and gently cook the onion and mushroom for 5-10 minutes, until they are slightly softened and beginning to shrink in size, but are still not yet fully cooked.  
Transfer these to the slow cooker, and add the stock, kethcup, paprika and sliced garlic.   
Cook on high for 4 hours or low for 8 hours. (i did high for 4)  
When cooked, stir in the sour cream and chopped parsley.  
It was a bit too liquidy for my tastes at first, so I pulled the sauce/juice off to the side in a pan and let it cook on high for about 10-15 minutes.  I also pulled some of that off when it was hot, put it in a cup, and mixed in two heaping spoonfuls of cornstarch and readded that mixture in order to help it thicken.  It thickened some, but not a ton.
Serve with pasta or rice.  

Also, it's quite low calorie.  I tallied everything up on the site caloriecount.com and all told it came out to about 1000 calories for the entire thing, or 200 per serving.

pfromad,freelance,1390265384.0,"Am an artist, and I have to admit that I haven't been feeling to worried about rejection lately, but I think that is because my process involves lots of feedback and working with other creative people before I even get to a point where I'm showing anything to someone who's got the capacity to reject work out of hand. By the end I'm fairly confident in what I end up with. 

Beyond that I'm so worried about delivering high quality productions that I couldn't care less whether some people likes my work or not by the time I'm done. If you feel like you're delivering something that not just anyone could do, it's not such a big deal if people don't like it. 

So yea, to summarize:

1. Have a process that includes input from other creatives. 

2. Do something in a way that not just anyone could do. 

I guess one thing to remember is that non-creatives will reject a piece of work for any damn reason, so if you build methods of creative support into your process, you'll significantly reduce the chance that people will dislike your work simply because they disagree with your egotism. "

kempff,cheatatmathhomework,1390265387.0,"Looks like you're being asked to find a second-degree equation whose graph passes through (-2,-3) as a vertex and passes through (1,2) somewhere else.

This could be literally any conic section, but I'm guessing you're doing parabolas these days since ""vertex form"" doesn't apply to anything else.

Vertex form goes to the tune of y = a(x-h)^(2) + k, where (h,k) is the vertex and a is what I personally call the narrowness factor.

So if the vertex is (-2,-3) we have y = a(x-(-2))^(2) + (-3), cleaned up is y = a(x+2)^(2) - 3.

But the graph also passes through (1,2) so we further refine this to 2 = a(1+2)^(2) - 3, making a = 5/9, so that the final answer would be **y = (5/9)(x+2)^(2) - 3**. Done! :-)"

Maybe I'm exceptional. Maybe you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

&gt;LOL, a REDPILLAR is telling me that my world view is fucked up? Hilarious.

I'm not a redpiller you fucking idiot.  I've been banned from trp for making fun of those assholes.  Go through my post history and you'll find plenty of examples of me talking about how both redpillers and feminists are fucking idiots who have no fucking idea how the world actually works, because you're dogmatic shitbrains, and they're just taking the same dogmatic shit and inverting it.

&gt;Haha, too bad you have no evidence to back up any of your outrageous claims, nor do you have any ceredibility. Maybe you should think of yourself, become more self aware.

Bitch, I am so fucking self-aware I am on a first name basis with every single last one of my personal demons.  I am a professional writer and novelist.  I give my issues names and writes stories about them as I work through them.  I have self-awareness coming out my fucking ass.  

Do not tell me that i am not self-aware, you blind, ignorant motherfucker.  You are living in a land of shadows and illusions, and I am one of the few motherfuckers you'll ever meet who has even dared to crack an eye open.  You are like pale fucking shadows of real people to me.  You are lesser beings, and you need to fucking recognize.

&gt;Wow. That may be your opinion, but doesn't it stand for men too?

Men are the best.  We rule everything.  We have all the privileges.  We kept women oppressed for all of human history *without even meaning too*.  We're that fucking awesome.  We just rule naturally I guess.  Because feminists are always telling me that patriarchy isn't a conspiracy, that it wasn't planned.  It just happened, right?

So I guess men just kinda rule.

&gt;Men are subject to this society just as much as women are.

Are they?  Because I thought men made society, that we were the actors.  If men are subjects of society, and women are subjects of society, then whence comes society?

OH WAIT!!  Maybe you're just a fucking idiot, and you're reifying the concept of society into something that makes no fucking sense, and so all your idea that extend from this foundational mistake only take you deeper and deeper into derpity derp derp.

&gt;The only reason they have been seen in a better light is because they're so caught up in how each other act and they're so jealous of each other that they can't make their own decisions and always have to come out on top.

Wow, so much sour grapes.  You're just sad because girls basically never do anything worth writing down.  ""Today I made some butter and spread my legs so my husband could rut with me.  I am woman, hear me roar!""  Boo hoo!

&gt;Because we don't care about you, we don't care about your feelings, and we don't like you.

Maybe they just think you're fucking hypocritical pieces of shit because you're entire schtick is demanding incessantly that people care about you, your feelings and that people like you while making it so fucking obvious that you feel no obligation to treat others the same way?

I mean, fuck, you just admitted you're a racist and sexist hypocrite motivated by hatred and revenge.  Which is pretty much how everyone who doesn't like you (including me!) describes you.

I'd ask you to think about that, but you're clearly a fucking idiot and if thinking was in your wheelhouse you wouldn't be here.

Dinaroozie,FeMRADebates,1390265740.0,"I've heard this described as ""Trickle-down equality"", and that's a characterisation I very much agree with (including the parallels it draws between this and trickle-down economics). Assuming good intentions of the speaker, they basically seem to be saying ""Well, we're treating the root cause, so there's really no need for you to be treating the symptoms."" However, feminists are (quite rightly) getting very busy treating the symptoms as well, so long as the symptoms are women's issues. Given that, it seems odious to suggest that MRAs shouldn't be treating symptoms that are men's issues. I'd be curious to hear what some of the feminists of this subreddit think about this 'treating symptoms versus treating causes' way of thinking about this issue.

To abandon reasoning and go with my gut instinct for a moment: I think the author of that article actually doesn't think there are any legit men's issues, and is basically trying to rephrase ""Dear MRAs, please shut up"" until it sounds kind of good. I won't go into great detail because I realise that that particular post isn't the point of this discussion. I do think, though, that if the tone of the person saying ""Help us dismantle the patriarchy"" matches that of the linked article, I could forgive MRAs for taking it basically as an invitation to piss off."

bluemayhem,Feminism,1390265770.0,"I don't know, the gendering of kids toys instills at a very young age a sense of otherness in the opposite sex, that those people are different from you and should be separate, and helps enforce  society's ideas of what men and women are supposed to be and how you should act. Really this kind of shit is a precursor to a lot of other problems that face women. I mean it's not throwing acid in the face of women for going to school, but it is a thing, and the framing of being related to adventure time, a show the internet is in love with, is a good entry point to get people interested in the subject.

notskunkworks,relationships,1390265784.0,"Without the proper context, you have no idea what that information means about her. Does it mean she's wildly promiscuous and won't be happy without novel dick? Does she just really enjoy sex and went through a period where she was single? Is she a sex addict who will eventually cheat on you? Or was she going through a dark period of her life trying to fill some void and numb herself with sex?

You don't really know, so your mind is left to speculate what this all means about her. Part of you wants to recoil in disgust, another part of you knows that's hypocritical, and yet another part of you feels insecure and sexually insignificant.

Remember, this is not about what's an appropriate number of sexual partners. This is about you:

* Not knowing enough about this person
* Not knowing what's in store for you and her
* Worrying that sex alone is not enough to keep your relationship together

And to address those points:

* You need to learn more about her and her attitude toward sex and monogamy. This is to double-check that you share a common foundation and compatible perspective.
* By learning more about her and her sexual energy, you'll have a better sense about your long-term prospects.
* Monogamy with your partner is one way you can show commitment to the relationship and make them feel special, but a lot of the time, it's a mistake pinning too much of your ego and pride on sex and sexual exclusivity. Humans act monogamously, but we are not actually monogamous by nature. We are attracted to many people. If your sexual security is pinned upon you being the pinnacle of sexual attraction in your partner's eyes, you're going to be disappointed: that attitude doesn't allow any room for the truth, which is that we are sexually attracted to many others, and given no consequences, we would fuck a lot of people.
* Instead, once you've decided that this person is someone you want to be with long-term, focus on the fact that this person has chosen to be with you and has chosen to be monogamous as well. It's not because you've slang the best dick -- you don't -- it's because you have some combination of qualities and looks and energy and positivity (and dick-slanging too).

Edit: and to the downvoters, you could totally say what you disagree with in a comment. I wouldn't be angry."

On Mercury you'd see the blinding glare of the sun and little else.  The sun is searing hot but at night it's bitterly cold.  The entire planet is perpetually motionless.

On Venus you'd feel a slow but oddly powerful breeze.  The atmosphere doesn't move quickly but it's *much* heavier than Earth's.  It'd be light, but dim and gray.  It's infernally hot day and night.  Your iPhone melts.

On Mars you'd feel a faint chilling wind in the light atmosphere.  The sunlight is fairly bright, although not as bright as Earth.  Everything is a dull brown.  The noon temperature in the summer is fairly pleasant, at night it's colder than Antarctica.

On Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune you'd feel winds more powerful than any hurricane you could possibly imagine.  Deep in the planets you'd get lashed by ""rain"" of various chemicals.  Eventually the atmospheres get so dense that they're more liquid than gas and you're swimming in a ""sea"" of supercritical fluid.

Temperature here is dominated by depth.  The tops of the clouds are arctic cold, the depths hotter than Venus.

Basically, Mars isn't that bad, Mercury is a frying pan, Venus a blast furnace, and the gas giants are hellish tempests.

Pluto the non-planet is unimaginably cold.  The sun casts faint shadows but it's as dark as an average moon-lit night on Earth.  In the summer there may be a faint atmosphere, in the winter everything is still."

ursei,curlyhair,1390265863.0,"Hmm, well when I used baking soda only I found that over time it got a bit too drying for me if I used it more than once every few months. It sounds like you need more moisture. Dryness will cause frizz, but I understand that most products feel too heavy for you, so I'd try experimenting with different ways of getting some moisture.

[This article](http://www.livecurlylivefree.com/curl%20care.htm#The_Conditioning) was what really helped me understand how important moisture is to getting my hair to not frizz and has been the main thing that has helped me. Maybe experiment with different silicone free conditioners until you find one you like, and try combing it gently while wet with conditioner instead of dry. I'd also switch out the baking soda with JR Liggetts old fashioned shampoo bar (it's sulfate free) because it won't be so drying. It has a little oil in it too so it's possible if you don't need too much moisture, that that could be enough for you even without a conditioner. 

If you wanted a really natural and basic approach, maybe try a more diluted baking soda mix (like 1 cup to 1 tbsp of baking soda or less) but then do an apple cider vinegar + water rinse and comb it with the ACV on, and then put a tiny bit of argan oil while it's still wet. 

Hope some of these ideas could help you! And how awesome that you're traveling, I wish I were doing that right now :)"

I know u/inglorious1991 asked for male equivalents to this picture but the links you gave aren't really reflecting similar attitudes to men at all. I'm not denying that men are sometimes objectified (e.g. Coca cola ads we get in the UK over summer), but we should be honest that that's not terribly on-topic. 

The caption on this fake ad is saying women who aren't virgins are like used cars (worth less), and it's scary that it's got so many upvotes from users who won't bat an eye at the kind of effect that has on men and women (especially important given the amount of teens using Reddit who are currently working out their identities, working out what's normal etc.)

flashmedallion,metalgearsolid,1390266110.0,"It would help a bit if I knew which ones you were struggling with, but I'll stay general.

As with most bosses, the first thing to do is learn the patterns.  Know what attacks are coming and how you avoid them.  You've probably got that part down.

Ammo:  Are you bringing supply markers?  Miller will usually tell you at the start of a battle that you might not have enough ammo if you don't bring these.  Do you know how to use them?  Just checking the basics.  When you're out of items, including ammp, you throw them (L1+R1), and then activate them (R1).  This will call for a cardboard box delivery, which will have health and ammo in it.

Health:  The mech bosses are best with the punchiest rocket launcher you have.  The basic RPG should get you pretty far, but you really need to work on get better rocket launchers and upgrading them.  The fastest way to beat the mechs is to concentrate your fire on the AI Pod - that's the big red cylinder.  This will damage them the fastest.  There are other ways to handle the fights, but if you haven't finished the story then you don't need to worry about that yet.

So:  Supply Markers to keep your ammo and health topped up.  Take the ""Thrown"" ones in one of your equipment slots, there's no real use for the ""Pistol"" type taking up a weapon slot.  Concentrate ordinance on the AI Pod.  Learn the patterns of each fight - each mech requires quite a different approach.

If that's all obvious and useless to you, give me some specifics (what you're stuck on, what weapons you have) and I'll try and give some better advice."

And by saying, ""I dont want to lose those moments with him,"" she's even hinting that she understands that if she *does* tell him she ""loves"" him, it might send him packing. 

&gt;otherwise she wouldn't be asking whether to tell him that she thinks she loves him.

Disagree again. We don't always tell people what's on our mind only because we think/hope/want them to feel the same way or agree with us or whatever. Sometimes we do it for our own peace of mind. If it's ""killing her,"" maybe she *should* tell him. She puts all her cards on the table and he'll either feel the same way and stick around (win), or he'll leave and she'll be able to move on (win).  "

There's no reason to say such a thing unless you're trying to be smart hipster anarchist guy who takes issue with Chomsky unlike all the other plebes who you feel just eat everything he says up. It's a form of exceptionalism and I don't like it. In my opinion, if you take issue with him, then you should be happy to take a piece of his and then disseminate it and tell everyone why you disagree with him or his stances. That's the way I would approach it, anyhow.

There's no arguing with a lot of what Chomsky says (his anti-war stance, his support for the Palestinian cause, his criticism of the state an so on), so to completely take issue with him and say stuff like OH I'M SO GLAD WE'RE NOT READING CHOMSKY LOL is clearly hipster anarchism.

We tried to keep the kid calm while my manager starts heading to the back office to get the phone and call for help, when the door opens, and Father of the Year pokes his head in and calls for the kid. He looks at my manager, says ""Thanks, I needed time away from him"", and walked out with the kid like that was a completely normal thing to do.

Last customer was in the store at least 30 minutes before the father came back, and we didn't see him with the last group of customers. Kid was probably asleep on/under a bench in back of the store, and woke up to his dad missing. I can't figure out why people think that's a good idea."

But that will only last so long.  Definitely not for one of the longest fights in the game.

If you can do 200~250 DPS on Titan EX, you're golden.  If anyone expects more than that out of a BLM, they're expectations are way too high.

And actually, Thundercloud should always be used *before* Firestarter.  Firestarter procs are controlled, since we have to cast Fire I to proc it.  Thundercloud has a chance to proc every 2-3 seconds on its own.  Chances are low, but it can proc back to back, which means you could waste a proc by using Fire III first and getting yourself GCD locked."

The Selkie cannot work with Emissary, I think the Geist is just better here. Geist then effectively ""draws and free-casts a 3/2 with 2 devotion"" when he dies. So he's kind of very similar, but combos with BTE.

badponies,AskWomen,1390267003.0,"I'm the same.  I used to watch porn, but now only get off to thoughts, pics, and videos of my SO.  Even if I wanted to, it would take some effort for me to get off to porn, since I'm very attracted to the emotional aspects of sex.  She's the one I have that connection with, so jerkin' it to anyone else would be a distraction from what I like the most. 

To the OP, my experience notwithstanding, I'd say that a person satisfying themselves while thinking about someone other than their partner is more common than not.  However, just because something is considered 'normal' doesn't obligate you to think that way too.  

Since you raised the question, I'm assuming you're not a hypocrite and you don't think of anyone besides her while masturbating.  If that's the case and something about it makes you feel uncomfortable, then I suggest talking with her in an open, nonaccusatory manner.  I can't predict what her response will be, but in my 17+ years with my SO, discussing sexuality in a vulnerable and nonjudgemental way is one of the best ways to build intimacy.

I'm not accusing you of this, but if you ever expect your SO to live up to a standard that you don't hold yourself to, then it's a sure sign that you need to get over yourself.  "

RocketMan63,QuotesPorn,1390267034.0,"Even if that is the intention of the quote it still seems incredibly pushy and judgmental. For example, a rich man could do something meaningful for every homeless person he meets. He could quite his job and volunteer full time, He could take people into his home and give them enough money to better themselves until he eventually is nearly homeless himself. He could have made a huge difference. But suppose he didn't, suppose he walked right on by and instead accidentally continued his job where he accidentally discovered the penicillin. Or suppose he didn't. Suppose he spent the rest of his life and money on his family and kids working on his carpentry. Would you say he had committed suicide of the soul? I hope that you wouldn't.

So the question would be at what level is a person obligated to give their life or put themselves to something fully. I would argue that there isn't a threshold for that and it's entirely up to the person and what they want to do and whether or not they've committed ""suicide of the soul"" I entirely based on the person and the way they view their decision.

Another example. A person has to choose whether to have them and their family die or have all other humans die. This decision is entirely up to the person and how they value things. If they choose to keep their family we can't say that they have died and the cessation of breathing in their life is but a belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit. You can't say that because it simply may not be true."

I dont see this happening any time soon. This was the case in the US for several decades, but never took hold in Europe. The Glass-Steagall Act implemented this requirement after the Great Depression, but the repeal of it was largely due to American banks having difficulty competing with European banks. 

The Volcker Rule in the Dodd-Frank Act (response to the 2008 crisis) mandates a new separation of investment and commercial banks. They were hoping similar regulations would take hold in Europe, but they have failed to materialize. So as of now the Volcker Rule implementation keeps getting postponed to avoid putting US banks at a disadvantage again. 

Nobody wants to miss out on business, so countries usually conform to laws in the least restrictive countries. And the UK strongly opposes a similar rule in Europe. "

Necron_Overlord,TheBluePill,1390267144.0,"&gt;Anyway, my point is that the logic you're using is obviously faulty. 

Then demonstrate how it is faulty.

&gt;Yes, the ideas of rights and equality at the basis of feminism took centuries to develop and for long periods of time didn't exist.

We're not talking about feminism.  We're talking about resistance from the very beginning.  It took a long time for patriarchy to become codified as actual laws and social institutions.  Patriarchy clearly evolved over time, and took many different forms in different places.  Why did that happen?  If patriarchy is the oppression of women, then why didn't patriarchy develop a concurrent history of anti-patriarchal revolution in the same way that the development of authoritarianism was matched by a concurrent development of anti-authoritarianism?

It's obvious that feminism has its roots in the Enlightenment, and that is where the modern concepts and ideas of equality and rights were developed.  But the Enlightenment was merely one point on a long history of anti-authoritarianism that has reflections all the way back into antiquity.  Anti-authoritarian themes can even be found in the earliest known stories, such as the *Epic of Gilgamesh*. 

Why is there no ancient feminism in antiquity?

&gt;By your logic nobody can ever be oppressed for an extended period of time because logically they would have to rebel.

And amazingly enough, we find throughout history that whenever leaders became oppressive, revolt swiftly followed.  Except with women!"

I've had the paragard for about 6 months, and my periods got back to normal after about 3 or 4 cycles of terrible long periods. My periods are usually quite long, in the 7-day range, but very light, so for those few months they were basically 14 days (haha) and crampy but still very light.

whale_kisses,AskMen,1390267225.0,"I wasn't trying to imply that selfishness and maleness are linked in the general population. I *am* saying that this guy is selfish and he is likely using his gender to justify his actions. He can sleep around and she can't, right? Why? Probably because he's a man and she's a woman and in his mind, there's a difference. I would bet you all the money in my wallet that this is not the only example of gender inequality OP has seen from him if she sits down and thinks about it. You should be mad at this guy for thinking this way, not at me for calling him out on it."

larrylemur,SubredditDrama,1390267228.0,"&gt;Strangely, I hate the idea of bitcoin. But I love the idea of dogecoin. 

Maybe because bitcoin enthusiasts are furiously rubbing bitcoin into the ground going ""IT HAS TO WORK, NWO FEDERAL RESERVE MUST BE BEATEN, ALL WHO DO NOT BELIEVE WILL FALL"" while dogecoiners just are pretty chill?"
Exceedingly,AskReddit,1390267229.0,"This was on a program I watched recently (I'll try and find a link)

The ELI5 version is that when it's cold the upper atmosphere reflects sound down better (instead of letting it fade out) and it bounces back sound waves from hundreds of miles away, but only the bass carries.

So if there's some massive industrial works going on in a mine or something, the sound pretty much travels up and back down to your town.

It's when the cold condition is right for the sound to work.

Let me find this video.

Edit: Has it been colder than usual where you live during this?"

There was one earlier where Antic set a back screen on Chalmers and he acted like he rolled his ankle. I thought maybe Antic did the ole KG on Belinelli [trick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAfp6ZCsvGc) and basically ran him over, but Antic was set. "

Not the rural town in bumfuck nowhere Saskatchewan that hasn't had a real doctor in the town for years. Then compound that with people wanting to be specialists but not looking at the supply and demand for these when they are considering the career path. It's a good system that works for lots of people but others are heavily shafted. I know a couple places where their local clinics were all just shut down only because they couldn't get a doctor to work there. Then everyone from that area suffers in having to go further for care. It sucks and is a very difficult issue to tackle. Young doctors are given lots of benefits to work in these small towns but sure as hell they won't want to work in them unless they are literally dragged there. And you want a doctor working who at least relatively enjoys his job otherwise things will go to shit quite quickly. It's a tightrope our nation really has to traverse carefully. "

maowsers93,texas,1390267902.0,"Right, lets look at the highlights shall we? 

Davis's relationship to her first husband ended when she was 19 but the divorce wasn't finalized until she was 21. So they're saying her life story was ""blurred"" because the divorce finalized 2 years later than she said she was a single mother, which she was. 

They say her story is ""blurred"" because she apparently didn't live in the trailer long enough for their liking. Let me explain something here. I lived in a trailer in middle school for a few months and grew up very poor. Insulting people who grew up poor by saying they didn't live in the mobile home long enough for your liking is going to do nothing but piss off other people who've lived through those situations. Davis grew up poor and had to begin working as a teenager to help their family meet ends meat. 

And then of course we can't forget that they're questioning her ability to be a mother. Awesome. She left for a year to finish her degree and then later conceded custody of her youngest daughter to her ex rather than dragging her family through a custody battle. Good to know that as a woman if you concede custody or leave for work for a period of time you'll be called a neglectful mother. 

My brother-in-law often spends months at a time in Boston and Canada for work. He works there so much that he actually pays taxes in both those places. His loyalty to his children have never been called in question. My father has been married 3 time and conceded custody of me and my brother to our respective mothers after the divorced, and his loyalty to us as a father has never been questioned. It is absolutely infuriating to see that as a woman if you ever leave for a period of time or agree to custody terms that don't result with you being the sole provider that you'll be called a bad mother. 

Oh, and Davis had a sugar Daddy who she just used and left when she was done? That's interesting considering he was the one that filed for divorce. How you can make an argument that she left her husband after she was done with him when she wasn't even the one that filed for divorce is beyond me. I mean, I'm even a little impressed. Framing a topic as though she bleed him dry and then left him when the reality is that he left her, wow, I applaud the balls that something like that takes. 

Word to the wise, during a political battle that largely involves women's rights it isn't advisable to base your campaign against your female opponent off of her ability to be a mother. 

At this point so far the negative campaign against Davis is one that paints her as an ""Abortion Barbie"" who was a horrible mother. Nothing on her voting record, nothing on what legislation she's authored, no no just a smear campaign based on her looks, her stance on choice, and her ability to be a mother. From the bottom of my feeble fragile and simple female heart to those who think a woman's ability to serve publicly is based off her femininity  ............ go fuck yourself. "

I, for one, wouldn't. And I know quite a few 49er fans who dislike Crabtree already because of his attitude, demeanor, and rookie holdout etc. So it's really a large assumption to think that just everyone would love it. Maybe you're right but I personally don't think so. 

I take very little issue with him declaring that he's the best. He's probably right and is certainly in the conversation so he's one of the few that can make that statement...but I do take issue with the need to, in multiple post game interviews and now I see a written article, call out Crabtree by name and insult him... Seems to be a low blow. 

As /u/Pengawolfs07 pointed out below (or above idk how reddit sorts), Crabtree's response is also pretty bad. I understand a guy can only take so much abuse before he wants to push back but his rationale is pretty lame. Crabs got beat on the game deciding play. He lost. And even if Sherman had a bad game, I'm sure you could find film of Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Michael Jordan and so on having a bad game...doesn't cement the status.

...or you could use a modern frame. Honestly this wont be a matching numbers gun anyway so vintage parts is just aesthetic they add little value to the gun. Also a new frame will have over sized rails that will need to be filed to fit. This is good because original 1911 frames and slides were known to be ""rattle jobs"" with huge tolerance clearances. Brownelles sells a great Caspian carbon frame that will fit your slide for $270 here:

http://www.brownells.com/handgun-parts/frame-parts/frames/1911-auto-receiver-prod4968.aspx

Please buy a spring kit and replace ALL springs. Also you will need a barrel, bushing, and link. Ed Brown makes a relatively pain free drop in match fit kit with all 3 for $180ish. 

A word of warning. This is not just an assembly process. You will need to fit and file and polish these parts till they work. It will take a LOT of time and effort and when it's all done you have to refinish the gun so it doesn't rust away. Expect to pay $150-200 for re blueing or parkerizing. "

Omega037,changemyview,1390268401.0,"This list covers a huge range of views and needs to be split up.

Here is my quick answers though:

1. They were passed under the pretense that they would ""pay for themselves"" with increased economic activity.  That didn't happen at all, we just exploded the deficit.  Why would more breaks do anything besides make this worse?

2. So are many Democrats, including the only Democratic President.

3. This one would just take too long to answer here.  Ask it separately please.

4. Many Democrats are patriotic and serve in the military.  There are also some parts of the Republican party that are isolationist and somewhat anti-military.

5. Good in theory, bad in practice.  Take away their license and they just drive anyways, but without insurance.  State tuition is only for children who were basically raised almost their whole lives in the US and call no other place home.  Border security costs a lot of money and isn't very effective, not to mention that the amount of illegal immigration is on the decline anyways.  Nobody is getting automatic citizenship, either.

6. Based on what?  Most of their policies are focused on social programs designed to help people.  You can argue that these programs are ineffective or affordable, but the intent is generally to help people.  At the very least, looking at things like Shutdowns that are objectively bad for the country, the Republicans certainly could earn the charge as well.

7. So do most Democrats.

8. Education *is* mainly done in English.  The only places it is not is where the children don't know it.  The effect of this policy would not cause them to learn English, it would just make for less educated people.

9. Nobody thinks terrorism is a good thing, it is just that many programs have hurt civil liberties and cost a ton of money yet haven't stopped almost any terrorists.  That is what people oppose.

10. The issue is more with the fact that one can almost never be sure of guilt.  Many people have been wrongly convicted of murder, and some have even been executed for it.  If there were a magic truth potion then things would be different, but so long as we have a flawed judicial system, we shouldn't make any irreversible punishments.

11. This costs money and hasn't really prevented any attacks.  What those armed guards are for is usually internal issues (students who have drugs, are in gangs, commit violence, etc).  This is why you see them more in High School and not in Elementary Schools.  For that purpose, it isn't a bad idea.

12. Again, another issue that would be way too long to take you through the science, so ask it separately.  That said, we can have our cake and eat it too.  New carbon-based fuels like natural gas are a *lot* greener than things like coal, and new CAFE standards are greatly increasing car efficiency.  There is a lot of middle ground here.

13. Affirmative Action was created out of a very quantifiable problem with existing racism at schools.  White men would be selected at much higher rates than Blacks or women with the exact same scores.  This was a systemic problem that was preventing equality, because less educated minorities meant less minorities in professional positions.  Now that this bias is started to go away, so have many of the Affirmative Action policies have started to fade out.  They were a solution to a real problem that helped solve that problem.

Also, you have no idea what the admissions process was.  Perhaps his extracurriculars or essay was better than yours.  Or he was applying for an easier program/major.  Given the current state of things, I would almost bet money that it had nothing to do with Affirmative Action.

Anyways, I am a Republican as well, and unless you are willing to become more educated about a lot of these issues, I would ask that you leave the party so that I don't have another blowhard to have to disassociate myself with.

I would, in that case, but if they had one, and that one wasn't Google, I really wouldn't see the issue. I have made a website for a charity: we had paypal, an address to send checks to, a facebook ""causes"" page, and the parent charity's website on our list. There was no security issue with any of this.

&gt; If you mean google should have a whitelist, it does, you can pay with just about any credit card and through carriers and directly from you bank account if you hook up your wallet.

So... The whitelist is one item long: Google Wallet. You can't pay with a credit card, you can pay with a credit card through Google Wallet -- those are two different things. You can't pay with paypal. You can't pay through any bitcoin payment processors. You can't pay through your bank, directly. You can't pay via your carrier (not that anybody should want to, that idea was stupid).

&gt; Anyhow, there's more freedom if you let google control their market, not only does that mean you can do whatever you want with your store,

Whatever you want, as long as Google decides to allow you to do it. Total freedom, except, you know, in any way.

&gt; but Google actually requires sideloading to be available on the device to get the play store,

Oh, that's nice of them. It doesn't mean that the play store policies are good -- true freedom would be if we were able to sideload *and* Android software was able to use alternative payment methods without incurring the wrath of Google.

&gt; What happens when CEVO, yet again may I remind you, turns out to be just as bad as the other times they tried to restart their TF2 league?

From what I gather they have brought Lange and Nahanni in specifically to tackle this issue. I'm sure they know what works and what doesn't.

&gt; When people realize there will be no LAN for the foreseeable future?

So what? 90+% of the NA TF2 scene will never get to participate in LAN, so why would this be a dealbreaker for most of you? It's utterly ridiculous for the rest of the NA scene to consent to continued fucking by ESEA simply to keep the handful of players who get to go to LAN happy.

&gt; That none of the ESEA-Invite players are still around?

This happens all the time, and you know what happens? New players rise to the top. And frankly I would imagine most of the top players wouldn't be too keen to continue with ESEA after everything that has happened. Certainly Lange is jumping ship.

&gt; If CEVO is a bust, what is the likelihood that ESEA will reopen their TF2 division after we come crying back to them? 

I can't remember who it was that said that ESEA customers sound like battered wives, but by god they were spot on.

&gt; My point is not to ""Lol don't do CEVO,"" my point is that before we all jump ship on ESEA we should play a season or two in both leagues. **If you can't just play ESEA**, but if you have a little bit of extra time (You really only have to convert one day of scrimming to an official) sign up for both, and make sure that the service is actually worth the money before burning all bridges with the only paid league that has been there for years now.

All my wat.

If you think what ESEA did was unacceptable, if you want change, *you must vote with your wallet*. That is the only thing they will give a shit about. The bold is exactly the wrong way to approach this.

Anyone signing up to another season of ESEA is signing away their integrity. How you can even consider giving them more business after the way they have treated their customers is utterly beyond me, especially now that you have been given a viable alternative."

Disagreed, and the sales statistics agree with me

&gt;Basically, I think nintendo has to avoid both the casual gamer and the ""hardcore"" gamer demographics, and aim instead for the ""game buff"", the people who are looking for the classic console experience (and who probably have a gaming PC for games which they feel ""belong"" on the PC, such as shooters).

No, this is a hugely flawed strategy. The number of people who fit the following criteria

1. Want a console AS WELL as their pc
2. Don't want the next gen AAA rail shooter / field sports game
3. Give Nintendo credit for the ""nostalgia factor""
4. Have the money for dual systems despite being older by definition

is going to gradually get smaller and smaller. If they tie themselves to niche market that's shrinking, they starve to death. While the above may describe the loyalist nintendo fans around these parts, it definitely does NOT represent a viable market strategy. The growth areas have to be explored, and the most obvious one is mobile. They need to get their fucking back catalogue on the android and IOS stores like YESTERDAY. Sega are making a fortune off sonic being there, and that allows them to ship units to people in much, much higher numbers without the prohibitive cost of the hardware as they already have it. They can keep spitting out marios, zeldas, kirbys and jrpgs until they're blue in the face but they dont have the marketing muscle or core support to start new IPs and they don't have the mass appeal to push new consoles. 

TL;DR - Nintendo need to get into mobile like right fucking now."

There is just a way that a guy will do something and your heart flutters, you know it but it is subtle.  And yes, this has happened with the most unattractive guys.  And once again, it is individual.  I have flipped for guys instantly and my friends are like ""you're kidding.""  

I mean, who gets ""attention and dates"" I don't *actually* see this.  I don't hang out and watch people at clubs, etc.  We have stuff the media feeds to us.  But what sample set are we actually watching?

whoseworldisit,nba,1390268641.0,"The way I see it:

We've played exactly 41 games, and he's the half-season MVP. The ""25 or under with an MVP"" club is pretty exclusive company; the likes of LeBron, Jordan, Wilt, Kareem, Duncan and Iverson. 

So I don't think it's illogical to say he's on the same *track* as a 25/26 year old Duncan / Iverson (with a better attitude) / younger Magic or Bird -- when you consider the landscape of today's NBA. His situation doesn't really compare to Kareem or Wes Unseld, for instance. Relatively speaking, Durant's tires have very little wear. He just needs to refrain from doing his mother's driveway himself or catching AIDS, and he should have 10-15 more years in him. 

But it's worth noting that Derrick Rose was potentially on this path, even with a questionable MVP. He was significantly younger than Durant is now, and the high point of his life has been winning the MVP, it's all downhill since. And significantly downhill lately, considering his injuries. Rose panned out worse than other young MVP winners like Bob McAdoo who caught the injury bug later. But McAdoo and Durant are very comparable - unreal scorers and athletes. 

And finally, not all MVP awards are created equal. "

Since the Kings player dropped his stick in front of Marchand, shouldn't play have been stopped when the Kings gained control of the puck?

Granted, Marchand may have been awarded a penalty shot, but instead he regained control of the puck, deked and scored.

So, he tries to intervene verbally, that doesn't work. The only other option he has is to get physical, but he probably felt hitting the guy would end up with himself getting the shit beaten out of him. So, he gets physical, but in a crazy, wtf way - most likely hoping the guy would just nope right out of there. Obviously, that didn't happen.

But, here's the thing - your boyfriend has more guts than most men to put himself in a situation where he is more than likely to get assaulted, purely to protect you, his undeserving girlfriend.

FactualPedanticReply,AdviceAnimals,1390268920.0,"I don't disagree that the prices are ridiculous, but the high-end brands do have some practical differences if you're appearance-conscious - at least here in the 'states. 

Men's jeans in the 'states are sized by two numbers: inseam and waist. Women's are sized by a single number, roughly corresponding to dress size. Humans exhibit much higher variability in size and shape than can be encompassed by those numbers, so most brands will offer different ""cuts."" The men's side of those brands - especially those marketed toward workaday men - will tend to emphasize practical features of those ""cuts"" like hammer loops and painter's pockets, but even those cuts have different geometries to the fit around the waist, through the thigh, and down to the cuff. For women, these distinctions in cut-shape become even more important, because two size-12 women can have wildly different-sized and -shaped bodies. The clothing industry has a long tradition of making clothing that looks good on certain particular body shapes, but mediocre or awkward on the rest.

In the US, most cheap, department store jeans are cut and shaped to fit your typical aging american workman with a saggy, uninspiring butt and a modest beer gut. I'm very fortunate to possess exactly the body dimensions that clothiers think handsome, fashion-conscious young men in their mid-20's should be, so mainstream, low-cost brands suit me well.  (6'0"", 12-stone-7, 38R drop 6, 16""/34"" shirt, 33""-32"" pants) My friend, who's extremely broad-shouldered, 20 lbs heavier, and 6"" shorter will not be able to go into a mass-market, low-cost store and walk out in clothes that look like they were made for him, despite the fact that his body-type isn't really that uncommon. (To be clear, the dude's not fat - he's just built like a tank)

So yeah - wanting your clothes to look like they fit you well and are reasonably fashionable isn't a bad thing. Paying for a brand name is fucking stupid, but don't knock all non-cheap clothing."

2. The role they have played in the industrialization of our food system.

In the end though, they are no different than Walmart, Goldman, Enron, or any other bad acting corporation out there.

ScipiiRye,TumblrInAction,1390268940.0,"&gt; I'm saying this because men's rights activists in general seem to be less about addressing actual issues and more about engaging in a mutual pissing contest with feminists over who's the greater victim.

To be fair that's pretty much social justice in a nutshell. 

&gt; While they do occasionally raise valid points, they seem to have the attitude that men being disadvantaged in some ways by society means that women can't possibly have issues of their own. 

That sums up my opinion of feminism, too.

I would never identify as an MRA, but I believe that men's issues deserve as much attention as womens' do. Men just lack a movement or organisation that's taken seriously. All in all you make a good point in favour of egalitarian ideology.

One gender isn't oppressing the other, that's for sure.

Omega037,changemyview,1390268954.0,"Then there are two issues here.  The issue of what is more profitable, and the issue of what increases quality.

I think the vast amount of market evidence disagrees with you on the issue of profit.  The simply fact that they are going with this model should be enough to tell you that they predict it to be more profitable.

The quality argument is more interesting, but I still think you are wrong for two reasons:

1. Wouldn't a subscription-based service actually force the company to continually focus on quality in order to keep users, and also help keep out a lot of the trolls and other riff-raff?

2. Haven't many games that followed this model turned out to be *very* high quality (EVE Online, WoW, Star Wars Galaxies), while many ""free to play"" games are pretty crappy (e.g., Farmville, Candy Crush, Dragon City)?

021fluff5,cscareerquestions,1390269005.0,"I'll start by saying that I decided to go into CS after working in special education for a long time. (I also have a lot of friends and family with CS-related careers, and I'm constantly bothering them with questions about their jobs.) 

I know a fair amount about how to have a successful interview and how to communicate with employers/employees, and how to make a good impression on people in your first few weeks at the job. (These are things that are pretty much exactly the same regardless of the industry you're in.) Someone with more experience hiring new grads would be better qualified to answer some of your questions. :)

On to the advice! If you're not writing code regularly, your skills will start slipping. If your skills slip too much, you risk eventually not being qualified for coding-related jobs. If that's something that concerns you, hold off on applying to jobs in which you're not going to be writing/editing code. 

If I were you, I'd want to keep my programming skills as sharp as possible so I could keep as many options open as possible over the course of my career. 

In the meantime - what's your online presence like? Do you have a LinkedIn/Github/other website? (I always tell people to Google themselves every once in a while, since the HR staff at the companies you apply to are going to do it anyway.) If there's a CS-related side project you've been wanting to start, it wouldn't be a bad idea to work on it - it'll give you a fun thing to talk about at interviews and networking events. 

Good luck!"

For example, here on good old Earth, the size of insects is limited by these factors; millions of years ago, dragonflies with wingspans of over half a meter could be found flying around, due to global temperature and oxygen levels.

So, on high gravity planets the creatures might be more stout to survive under their own weight, and on low gravity planets they might be more spindly, but I don't think either would really make a difference in their absolute size."

You just linked to an image of a flag design I made that took 30 seconds to make.

It incorporates the traditional green (forest), blue (seas) and white (snow) of Cascadia with a traditional symbol of peace (appropriate as Cascadia is on the *Pacific* Ocean) that has additional symbolic reference to finding new lands (the olive branch).  By the standard measures of flag design, its a perfectly good flag design. 

I defy you to explain why that design is bad.  Seriously.

Replace barbell bench press with dumbbell bench press. There are some pros and cons to use dumbbells and aside from the obvious one (no need for a spotter) I'll let you use Google to find that information.

As for your workout schedule...

I'd get rid of situps, isometrics are by far the safest way to work your abdominals and if you do mostly freeweights then they are already getting a good workout as it is. You can also find other isometric ab workouts on Google.

If you want to run during your strength training then I'd recommend moving it to the end of your routine and use that as a cool down. At the very least, stretch before running.

For starting strength you should be fine without incline and decline press, but you should also be fine if you keep them in there."

It's stupid. The most slovenly man I've ever met was also the gayest man I've ever met, stereotypes don't reflect reality and it's dehumanizing. And I don't believe that it's okay to sexually demean or objectify gay men, straight women don't get a pass on fetishizing real people just because they are ""safe"". I do honestly believe that there's just as much prejudice by straight women towards gay men as there is prejudice by straight men against gay men. It just takes a different form when women perpetrate these stereotypes and hurtful things. 

But yeah, I've never treated my gay friends like that and never would.

Haven't you ever been to a major city in a country where the police carry guns? I know I've seen them in a few Western European countries before, but it is still very scarce, and even then it's usually just a holstered pistol which I doubt they ever use.


That said, I completely agree with you about the rarity of them meaning I would immediately shit one if I saw a gun in real life, especially if it wasn't in the hands of someone I trusted to be holding it. The fact that more household shootings in America are accidents rather than burglars makes me shocked that people still think it's necessary to fire on someone in your house at the slightest startle.

t0tem_,college,1390269402.0,"I went to a CC for 4 years and made 1 friend (in my last semester there).  
For the first 2 years at my university, I made no friends.  
In this past semester here, I've made a bunch.  

A general piece of advice: If you want something, put effort into getting it.  
A specific piece of advice: Find reasons to hang out on-campus.  

The reason I didn't make friends was **not** because I lived off-campus.  
The reason I didn't make friends was because I only ever went onto campus for classes (and immediately drove back home afterwards).  
Don't buy into any bullshit thinking that you will be a social pariah if you don't live in the dorms.  

(I've struggled with social anxiety all my life, and ""I'm a commuter, I can't help it"" totally was my excuse for not ever trying to make friends).  

Why did I start making friends last semester? Between/after classes, I just started hanging out in a study room that was dedicated to students of my major. Others did the same thing. It got more popular and more social as the semester progressed.  
That's really not hard. But it still is something you have to actively decide to do. You can't expect everything to fall into your lap. You have to reach out for them. But, plenty of times, they are well within a reasonable reach.  

Some of it also hinges on whether or not your school is a commuter school. Both my CC and my university are very popular for commuters. There's very little campus life, there are very few student orgs, and the school's support for them is bad. Maybe if I were at a bigger university, things would be different, if I had other reasons to stay on campus and other avenues to make friends on-campus. 

edit: Let me also add that there are tons of ways to make friends that are completely unrelated to school. Tons of cities have Reddit groups that do stuff. There's meetup.com. And all those standard, non-digital ways like joining a martial arts gym, or regularly visiting a bowling alley, whatever.  
I hang out with local Redditors once or twice a week, and my favorite group of friends is all 10+ years older than me, who I met through a Meetup.com group.  
I snooped a little bit on you. Your university is in Toronto. Toronto is great, and full of _stuff_ to go do! There's an /r/toronto  which apparently has monthly meetups. Start doing that at least. "

danhakimi,Android,1390269536.0,"&gt; Yes you can, it is the dominant form of payment, Google simply has a fancy front-end they call ""Wallet"" for the same sort of card saving features Apple and Amazon use.

No, Google Wallet is not a ""front end,"" it's an intermediary. It's a payment processor. It charges a fee to process your payment. It is specifically a payment processing service, not merely some system within some store for processing payments.

On the web, when buying Amtrak tickets, I can enter my credit card info through their web form, and while it isn't the best system in the world, it is not beholden to anybody but Amtrak, the Credit Card Companies, and I. I need to deal with Amtrak to buy Amtrak tickets no matter what. Credit Card companies are at least slightly competitive. I can also pay for Amtrak through other means--even with cash.

The Amtrak App is allowed to facilitate one in-app payment method: Google Wallet. I can choose any credit card I want, but I can't pay directly with that credit card: I have to go through Google, give them my CC info, agree to their terms, and give them their fees. The closest competition is for me to pray that Amtrak offers a sideload/other market alternative App that offers a different set of payment methods -- something entirely impracticable.

&gt; iOS, no sideloading, WP no sideloading, OSX it's disabled by default (same as Android) and Windows Metro.

I thought you meant elsewhere in the Android ecosystem. I'm surprised there's no sideloading on WP8. I'm *really* surprised that it's off by default on  OSX, and doesn't exist for the metro side of Windows. That's pretty fucked up."

That's a fancy way of saying that if people don't play Modern then they aren't going to start because the price of fetches changes.

sortaplainnonjane,Mommit,1390269745.0,"First, he went to the baby classes with me and tried to read a dad book.  (I flipped through it after...it sucked, so I can't blame him for quitting it.)  We chose the baby stuff together and he installed the car seat.  He also helped me get our bags ready.  I woke up knowing I was in labor, so he walked with me around the neighborhood before I decided I was ready to go the hospital.  Once there, he pretty much answered all the questions and gave people our info since I was past the point of caring about those sort of things.  He did counterpressure on my hips while I was still standing and walking.  I was in my own lil world, concentrating on contractions and using counting to cope with them.  When they started getting stronger, he took over the counting while I just got through them.  After the epidural, he got me snacks (yeah, I know...tsk, tsk on us) and kept me comfy.

He was by my side during delivery, but thankfully, it was a quiet supportive role as I could feel my baby and didn't need anyone to count or be in my face, yelling anything.  Yikes.  

After, baby stayed on my chest for 70 mins.  We used that time to relax and for her to ""feed"".  Then, he carried her over to be measured and all that.  Later, we bathed her together and he got cuddle time.  

It depends on how delivery goes.  We had a printed preferences plan, but it was just that...preferences.  We were aware that anything could happen and to remain flexible.  I'd talk to your doctor and see what s/he thinks of your wishes.  Also, make sure your SO knows your wishes.  Don't assume he'll know what you want when the time comes.  Actually talk about scenarios and what you'd want to have happen.  For instance, if a c-section had been necessary, I would have wanted him to stay with baby, not me.  "

dsklerm,TwoXChromosomes,1390269770.0,"So I found this really interesting.  I've been a fan of Bill Simmons and Grantland for a while now, and obsessively read just about everything they write.  I love the long form in depth analysis, I love the cheeky pop culture references, and most of all I love the modern take they take on sports and the way it reflects on our culture.  [Several months before Jason Collins came out to the world, Pulitzer Prize winner Westley Morris was writing about Brittany Griner and the casual queering of sports](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgrantland.com%2Ffeatures%2Fbrittney-griner-quiet-queering-professional-sports%2F&amp;ei=e8rdUuOkH4LcyQHf8oCwCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFPe99i2yIrUC007NGXOCrvYkYmcQ&amp;sig2=9I9y78U48e0mqkwdRQTrAg&amp;bvm=bv.59568121,d.aWc) and it quickly became one of my favorite articles.  Sports is still a (straight) white mans game in a lot of ways, most of the owners and managers are white  men, same for the reporters it's definitely the most desired demographic of fans.  This article was just so unlike them... I didn't like the misgendering, the ""chill ran down my spine line"" and a lot of other aspects about it.

But that being said, this is the response I want and I like.  And maybe it's like an old friend and my ability to move on from when they fuck up, I appreciate that they accepted ownership up the chain, that they pointed out their own ignorance and inability to think from the perspective of a trans person, and I like that they brought in a writer and board member of GLAAD to post on a *sports blog* that's readership is in the millions about what they did wrong.  Simply put, I'm glad the information is getting out there.  I'm glad millions of oblivious white dudes have spent slow MLK monday mornings after busy sports weekends (2 championship games, lots of basketball, hockey, etc) reading about how to be more tolerant, both towards transgendered people.  Never mind that the other big sports story of the day was about [Richard Sherman and his post game rant, but also the reaction to racist coded criticism from stodgy old jounalists](http://deadspin.com/richard-sherman-and-the-plight-of-the-conquering-negro-1505060117).  

Maybe it's because I'm kind of a sucker for the bright side of things, but I see this a good thing.  It wasn't that long ago I was really crude, and ignorant, hateful and dismissive.  I'm really thankful that I am considered a more tolerant, better person now.  I like educating myself.  I understand and know I may still be ignorant about some things, I don't know what I don't know, you know?  But I can keep trying to learn more, to be a better person.  I just hope it's enough."

zen_music,HomeImprovement,1390270118.0,"There are several ways companies set you up to install that faucet. Some have a rubber ""O"" ring that slips along the projecting copper pipe, some have a plastic fitting you setscrew onto the copper and then screw the faucet on.  I'm guessing you have that second kind.  (The ""O"" ring kind has an allen screw that you tighten from below) So your problem may not be with your original plumbing rough, but rather with those bits inside the faucet.  

Since the water flows easily just through the faucet, then leaks when you pull the shower knob, (inside is a ""gate dam"" like a damper, that diverts the water from the faucet to the shower) some part of that may be your problem.  

Fortunately, those parts are inexpensive and easily obtained. Just change the whole silver faucet set and you should be okay, as long as you left enough copper pipe sticking through to contact whatever system for sealing that the faucet has.

Lots of people have downloaded it and built their own machine using the older versions of parts I put on thingiverse.  Basicallly... whenever I make a new design I put the old one out there, and if you still can't make the parts I can provide.

The printer head is made from laser cut parts and flat packs for shipping.  This version needs to be glued together on arrival.  I've been doing a lot of drawings in an attempt to test it to failure.  So far, so good.

The motor mounts gave me a lot more trouble.  They're meant to work on either wood or glass, and each surface has different requirements.  Making it all work in one piece was 5 or 6 iterations.

I'm still not happy with the box for the electronics.  The slot for the SD card is on the ""cup"" of the box, but the electronics for the SD card are attached to the lid.  I've tried to open the lid with a card in a few times already.  If the guy who designed it can't remember, others will force it until something breaks.  On the ++ side it works on wood or glass.

I'm don't know how to package the machine for sale.  Obviously I want to offer a fully assembled version - just take it out of the box, mount it on the window, and go.  BUT I could offer a ""base"" package of electronics and motors and then tell people to get add-ons like glass version, wood version, spray paint version, extra long belts version, and so on.

&gt;Lol, Im in college, advancing my life and broadening my reach, what are you doing?

I'm about to publish another novel, buy a new house, buy a new car, and I'm seriously considering dropping ten grand on a champion german sherpard with security training.  But I might go on a month long trip to Africa, and then buy an untrained champion puppy when I get back, which is only like two grand.  And then I'll just teach myself to train the dog myself.  I already agility trained a show-winning border collie, so I can probably security train a german shephard.  I do have a serious phobia about dog bites though (got mauled as a kid), and while I work with dogs to deal with that fear, there's facing your fears and then's there's just being a macho dumbass to prove you aren't afraid.  And security training is one of those things that probably should be left to pros.

injoy,Christianity,1390270415.0,"Speaking as someone thoroughly Baptist (your flair!) and raised non-Calvinist, let me explain why I finally came over to those two points you're questioning...

1) it bothered me to think that Christ's death *actually* affected anything if He died for people's sins who then went to Hell... if God could forgive some people's sins and not forgive others, but Jesus died for both, then what was the meaning of Jesus's death?  How could God hold people accountable for sins that Christ paid on the cross, whether the people repented or not?  So finally I came to the position that whoever's sins Christ paid for, must be those who were forgiven.  Thus if not everyone was forgiven, then Christ didn't die for everyone's sins... limited atonement.

2) Why would God choose you or me?  Well, if a typical non-Calvinist Baptist, the answer is God chose me because I accepted Him.  I finally realized that that meant that *I* effectively got some of the glory for making the right decision.  And believing in a God who is entirely devoted to glorifying *Himself*, that just didn't work.  The only way God gets all the glory for salvation is if He is the only One with any say or sway.  So... He chooses us not for merit or anything we do or any decision we make, but for His own glory; He chooses us because He wants to.

Agree with everyone else; come over to /r/Reformed and ask away! :)  Lots of Baptists over there too, and folk who were raised non-Calvinist (like me!). :)"

&gt; Still, if it turns out that the aftermarket or recycled part was itself defective or wasn't installed correctly, and it causes damage to another part that is covered under the warranty, the manufacturer or dealer has the right to deny coverage for that part and charge you for any repairs. The FTC says the manufacturer or dealer must show that the aftermarket or recycled part caused the need for repairs before denying warranty coverage.

Everyone knows that some aftermarket parts are junk and some factory parts are junk. In this case, it clearly was both. The factory switch held up for quite some time (1997) and then after that the aftermarket ones failed on the regular."

almightybob1,truetf2,1390270816.0,"&gt; This last weekend there was a LAN. Can you honestly say that you didn't enjoy it?

I haven't even watched it. I'm more interested in the European scene than the NA one. News like the ESEA scandal is global of course.

&gt; Its a bonus for the entire community, the top players playing their best while all of us watch.

Is it really much different to watching a match between the top players which is taking place online? To a spectator it's pretty much identical apart from the cutaway shots of the LAN hall thrown in every so often. An online final between the best players would achieve almost the same thing.

&gt; Since we are talking in stupid comparisans, would you rather marry the girl you just met two days ago on the internet sight unseen, or the girl you met years ago and who you have an ongoing relationship with?

If I found out the girl I met years ago and had an ongoing relationship had been screwing me over behind my back throughout said relationship, you're damn right I would dump her ASAP and start seeing someone new. Better an unknown relationship than a confirmed abusive relationship.

I don't think you thought that analogy through very well, because it supports my argument far more than it does yours.

&gt;  but I'm not likely to just give ESEA the middle finger for an untested league.

If you are not already giving them the middle finger for how they treated their customers, you must be suffering from either amnesia or Stockholm Syndrome."

I find it interesting that you also suggest this picture isn't projecting any negative message about women. It's a given that in a monetary sense a used car has less value than a new car. For the joke to work in the picture, you have to be aware of the cultural assumption that men would generally prefer women to be untainted by previous sexual partners.

What do you mean **ALMOST**???  PHILISTINE!!!  This is large ham comedy at its finest!  If you had the brains god gave a cantaloupe you'd recognize that and wouldn't need to have it explained to you!

&gt;I dunno, it really beats out flinging strings of random swearwords at total strangers for daring to call you out for being a shrieky misogynist.

There's nothing random about my swearwords.  I work within a tight framework of scatological reference, that verges occasionally into the broader milleu of ""thing one cleans off dirty underwear or shoe bottoms"" and peppered with the occasional bit of archaic bluster to give it that quasi-Shakespearean effect.  It helps to mix in a lot of $.25 words like festering, pulsating, noxious, etc.  Really gives it that bombastic timber you need to convey ""I'm yelling in [Brian Blessed's voice!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBhPDxszukU)""

He's my inspiration, really.

Also, nobody dared to call me out.  /u/ibbity ran away, and someone else posted my comment here where you could all safely mock me from a distance without any fear of confrontation.

I might actually **respect** you pathetic fucks if you had called me out.  That's why I'm here, calling you fucks out.  But no, you cowards don't have the spine to call people out.

gonjow,short,1390270975.0,"&gt; I am well aware that men are superficial, easily distracted by sex, and cannot be expected to pull their weight in a home. A lot of men lack the skills needed to be emotionally supportive. Most men require extensive ""training"" on what they need to do to be responsive to their partner's needs (to be fair it IS different for a lot of people), and require prompting that a lot of women don't to remember birthdays/anniversaries/valentines.

You seem to be expecting or settling for a low class of men if that's the men that you know.  I also take it you're from a more rural area and not in a major city because those views are a little old fashioned and rather stereotypical.  Watch out posting that in some other subs cause you'll get roasted, LOL.  

But even if you believe those are true, what does that have to do with how you perceive you are struggling?"

Oh I realise, my brother is at BYU and only started at 22. Though the physically mature thing is a little off, almost all missionaries come off on worse shape than they left, it takes extreme dedication to stay fit on a mission.

&gt;So they definitely are married and have kids and whatnot, but they're also starting school at 21-22 for a lot of them.

Yep they're usually old enough by junior/senior year to have met their loves and where it isn't out of the ordinary to have kids come into the equation."

TioTaba,ainbow,1390270992.0,"You make a good point about not giving in to fear, and I think it's very admirable.

The thing is we are talking about human beings here. It's more than natural that op and the others here are afraid after what happened. That doesn't make them cowards or anything (to be fair, I didn't like your edit, but I still upvoted for everything else you said, and I'm not saying you called anyone a coward or nothing like that). It's not a matter of ""knowing their places"". I'm sure op felt terrible about asking his friend to take the earring off, but it was solely for concern about someone he loves. That's what fear can do to you: go over something you believe because you're afraid of something bad happening.

Altough I do agree with the ""I won't fear anything"" approach, I don't think that's the only approach. Unfortunately, like I said, not only Brazil has no kind of law to protect gay people, but we are experiencing a sudden power growth from conservative churches. That must be scary for anyone who's gay. I'm sure there are other ways to protest or make yourself be heard. There's always more than one way.

The police here usually treat those cases very well, specially when they get media attention, but the laws just ignore the fact that those are hate crimes. There are laws to protect women, laws against race discrimination, but no law to do something for the gay community. And for the looks of it, we won't see nothing of the sort for a long time.

Again, I really respect your position of not caving to fear, but please, be more considerate for the ones that do. They are people. They feel. They are scared of something terrible happening and they don't see any kind of protection coming their way."

vyvantage,AskReddit,1390271097.0,"I've taken stimulants (mostly Adderall or equivalent generic) for my ADD for almost a decade now, and I've had a range of experiences with each different drug, but these effects have remained pretty much constant:

1. I am more motivated to accomplish daily tasks and basic responsibilities. Paying bills, brushing my teeth, bathing, my job, the dishes and more can often go completely ignored if I am off my medication. I will remember them throughout the day when off my meds, but they will not remain in my consciousness long enough for me to act on them. I am not big on excuses, my focus just seems to come and go faster than I can manage. In terms of whether I'm more or less motivated than an average person, I'd have to guess my medication puts me at about par, which is what it's designed to do. I have no doubt that up'ing my dosage may increase my motivation and energy (possibly to super-human levels), but because of other side-effects, I'd hesitate to make that trade.

2. Though I am more motivated, it is not always to do productive things. Many times while on my medication I can become compulsively fixated on things that I consciously know are distractions or counter-productive to work that I need to be doing. Beating my own score at some video game. Researching the best mobile data plan for 4 hours. Organizing and tying all the cables behind my television cabinet. That kind of thing.

3. The source of this motivation seems to be a sense of panic and urgency, not euphoria or excitement. It is possible that this is just my personal reaction to stimulants, but that is what I feel. Even if what I am doing is typically fun for me, I may find it impossible to enjoy because of this pervasive sense of urgency. I get cold sweats, I panic about my life accomplishments (or lack thereof), I lose my sex drive, and have zero appetite.

4. Yes, zero appetite. This is a big one. On days without medication I can eat 4-5k calories. On my medication, I can go an entire day without remembering to eat. My intake fluctuates pretty intensely.

5. I am less personable. I am a naturally cut-and-dry, take-things-literally kind of guy, but when I am on my medication sarcasm, subtlety, and body language flies right over my head. On the flip side, I am much more analytic, calculating, and decisive. I suspect both of these have something to do with my sense of urgency activating a 'fight or flight' reflex to see and react to situations as quickly as possible, even when it's not very socially acceptable to do so.

In response to the ""bit like meth"" comment, I would guess that that is pretty much accurate, minus the euphoria. Though I've never done meth, I have done cocaine, and my Adderall certainly packed more of a punch than the white powdery stuff.

**EDIT**: GF told me this could be relevant‚ÄîI have never once felt any need, physical or otherwise, to take my medication, nor have I ever experienced anything that could remotely suggest addiction. Even after almost ten years, my biggest issue with it is how often I completely forget to take it. I have heard others (mostly unprescribed college students) talk about feeling like they need it or are getting addicted, but I have never been able to relate to any of those stories. Maybe this is because having ADD means I have a different neurophysiology, maybe not. I'm not a neuroscientist."

Big squads here are good, and let you take advantage of being able to disordered charge - you might be able to nearly wipe one target squad out just with shooting.  

I wouldn't deck the Captain out so much. If you're sneaking him into the vanguard vets or assault squad, I might drop the shield eternal down to a stormshield, the digital weapons, and the artificier armor. If you're going with the Shield Eternal, you might as well get the Chapter Master.

As for your particular point:

1. A micro-transaction model would work a lot better for *you*, but not them.  Seriously, they do extensive market research on this, and it shows that this model in their target market (which doesn't include you) would generate more net profit.

2. My point was more that either model has had both high and low quality games, so trying to say that the model itself will cause it to be poor quality is wrong.  My guess is that, considering their previous work, it will be exceptionally high quality regardless of the model."

I was sitting on top of the tower at a military base, as I had been doing for a couple hours just enjoying the view and taking shots at zombies that were talking around. All of a sudden, I hear shots come through the guard rails. I look down and see a guy with a gas mask and his rifle out. I tell him I'm friendly, and I won't be any trouble. Just take your stuff and go. He tells me we're at an impasse, and I need to put my hands in the air. He and his friend were just passing through and they would go. They started leaving but had their sites on me. Finally, at about 200 yards, they turned away and sprinted off. That's when I went prone and fired at his friend. I hit him in the back and killed him for no reason. The other guy tried shooting back but I was hidden at that point. He lost his friend and it would take forever to link back up and get loot again. I'm a dick."

* They can be, especially with a player like Mata. Don't forget that they were champions last season with the same team. If they get Mata and and 1 or 2 more players, they could easily be better than they have in years. Giving them such a quality, game changing player would be stupid.

* Not necessarily, there are definitely teams with deeper pockets.

* Probably not as much as you think. He has spent crazy amounts to keep the team competitive, even with no immediate return in sight. He's not going to fuss over whats a small amount of money to him.

* They were never going to sell us Rooney, selling them Mata just so they might think about it is a poor decision. They were smart enough to not competition, so we should do the same."

Bottom-line, in my eyes, it's not even worth getting upset about since the in-game mounts/pets vastly out number the 1 store bought mount they release a year. Plus they never skimp from on the mounts you need to pay for, and they're always extremely detailed, unique and nice looking (at the time of their release at least) instead of a lazy recolor or something.

IAMA_dragon-AMA,MLPLounge,1390271633.0,"[](/queenohshit)Just a few warnings: Dihydrogen Monoxide (DHMO) is a dangerous substance that millions of Americans are exposed to every day. The government even mandates that a sufficient proportion of DHMO must flow in water pipes! DHMO is extremely addictive, and addicts who go without it suffer heavy withdrawal symptoms, up to and including death. Not only that, but it's often labeled as the ""universal solvent"", and so will wear away at even the toughest rock, reducing its mass severely. Its liquid and solid forms are extremely dangerous, as inhalation of even a small amount can lead to hypothermia and death.

Be sure to warn your friends about this atrocity!"
Vulkenhyn,Scrolls,1390271633.0,"I agree. However, I have seen something in this thread that leaves me sort of perturbed. In general, I have been proud of the Scrolls community as a whole because I see very little stupid, childish and passive-aggressive behavior in player-player interactions. As such, I really think that we should not meet people who come to attack both Scrolls and us, being the player base as a whole, with the same insults and ad hominem arguing points that the rest of the internet seems to resort to so readily. I want this sub-reddit to be one that's willing to hear out even the most irritating of people and attack their arguing points not the people themselves. I suppose that's rather pie-in-the-sky but that's my 2 cents."

Necron_Overlord,TheBluePill,1390271643.0,"&gt;No Im saying that how you react to abuse isnt the same as how anybody else would react. Im not judging.

Oh, well, see, I am judging.  I am going to go on record as saying standing up to your oppressor is strong and brave, and being strong and brave is better than being weak and cowardly.

&gt;So you aren't serious

I'm not really like this in real life, but my arguments come from a legitimate world view that I think has value.  It is the sort of worldview I would tend to ascribe to anti-heroes and villains, for sure, but I secretly think heroes are saps.

&gt;""I know you are but what am I?""

No, I mean you are seriously reifying society and it has you completely confused about how reality actually works.  You've forgotten that society doesn't exist.  That its an *illusion*.

&gt;You trying to impress me or smthn?

Hey, you asked.

&gt;You know me so well, we should get married and raise our kids to be close-minded misogynists like you!

If I had daughters, I'd raised them to believe they could do anything they wanted.  I'd also raise them to expect to fight resistance every step of the way, to make enemies along the way, and that if it seems easy its because you're going the wrong way.  Same thing my dad taught me, same thing I'd teach my son, and notably something the vast majority of American women steadfastlessly refuse to accept and that feminists think can be changed (because they are stupid, stupid people).

You can call that misogyny, but my daughters would be taking over the world while your daughters would be whining about how Barbie made them feel ugly and how unfair it is that they can't parade around in public in a g-string and pasties without someone getting bent out of shape about it.  Because I'd raise my daughters to be strong, and you'd teach them to be weak.

What with your whole ""I don't make a distinction between being brave and being a coward.""  No fucking wonder women are so fucked.  Jesus.

On the whole, our relationship was fulfilling, full of love and joy. In the last month of our relationship, he had been emotionally abusive, neglectful, and treating me poorly in general. I had enough and broke it off before the semester ended (November). We came back from winter break a week ago and he still had some of his stuff at my place. Originally I was going to have a mutual friend bring it to him, but we ran into each other on the street near my dorm so I told him to come get the stuff himself. Next thing I know he's sobbing and telling me he had been cheating on me for that last month of our relationship with some guy. There were intense sexual desires he had for men that I physically couldn't satisfy him with, and he resorted to cheating on me to fulfill them. He also told me that he loves me more than anything, I was the best thing to happen to him, cheating was the biggest mistake in his life, he regrets it more than anything, etc. He has always been riddled with low self-worth, guilt, shame, depression, identity issues, and anxiety, all which I think combined in his brain to let him rationalize cheating. Then he started treating my like shit because of all that, too.


Since then he's made steps to start seeing a professional about his depression, and is trying his hardest to regain my trust and win back my love. I don't know what will happen. I don't know if I can trust and love him again. I guess I'll see as time goes by."
