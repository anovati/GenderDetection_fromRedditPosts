joethesaint,AskReddit,1388697595.0,"For starters, I don't believe this popular paranoid notion that surveillance is a means for the government to slowly rob us of our freedoms and have total power over us. They're not evil. They attempt to keep their country happy and crime-free for a living, and they see this as an effective way of doing their job. 

However, secret surveillance of our private lives is a step too far. I can see why governments would be tempted to do this, as it would be a very convenient way of fighting potential crime at its source, but it's a step too far in terms of breaching privacy.

Open public surveillance is something I am in support of. Cameras watching you in the street is not a breach of privacy. You aren't in private. No one is sitting at the other end of those cameras, following you around as you go about your daily life. Those cameras exist so that authorities can go back and look at the footage when a crime took place in front of one of those cameras. It is pure paranoia to suggest that you're being spied on by public surveillance cameras. The UK can currently boast the lowest crime rates in history, and previously dodgy parts of major cities are becoming a lot nicer and safer. This is because surveillance to a certain extent does a very good job. It's just important that it only extends as far as open, public surveillance, and doesn't cross over into secret, private surveillance.

**tl;dr** - NSA bad, CCTV good.

EOverM,writing,1388697626.0,"Sometimes.  It depends on the situation.  I have a story that one day I intend to resurrect, where the main character is a Gary.  Much less so than he was, however, in the first version.  The first version was a: the most powerful being on Earth, b: irresistible to women, c: a good soul, d: a tactical genius, e: you get the picture.  His current form is a decent tactician, probably the most powerful being on Earth (although his daughter probably will outstrip him if she ever learns how to use her abilities) and, well, yeah, OK, still irresistible to women, but he IS telepathic and subconsciously manipulates them into it, so it's not just innate.  Point is, he's no longer a good soul - in fact, he's a bit of a shitbag.  He may do the right thing in the end, but it won't be for altruistic reasons.  He doesn't really care on a personal level about anyone other than his direct family and a few friends - he'll protect others, but mainly out of a sense of duty, etc.

I have a way to go before there's no Gary left, but it's doable.  Sounds like yours isn't really a Sue in the first place - she's just the product of a pairing between two powerful figures.  That sort of thing happens all the time, and someone in that position is going to be interesting to tell the story of.  Just be careful.  If you ever start thinking that a character's too good to be true, they probably are."

Nassor,minnesotavikings,1388697640.0,"I believe what Chris said about Priefer. He'll forever be known as coach-cockblock to me. I was a regular at Old Chicago Eden Prairie for many years (I just recently moved back to my native Kansas City). Anyway one night a good looking tall blonde walks in and sits next to me. I'm single so naturally I find a reason to chat her up. After a while some guy randomly decides to join our conversation. Before long he introduces himself as Mike Priefer brand new Vikings Special Teams Coordinator. 

I'm doomed right? She mentioned how much of a Vikings fan she is. I'm a die hard Chiefs fan. I figured he'd steal her away but to my surprise he did the opposite. He was seemingly wing manning me! I'm like this guy is awesome. That's until I went to step out for a smoke. When I returned he's got his hands in her crotch at the bar in plain view. As soon as I got back he stopped. She seemed to be a bit disturbed by his sudden change in attitude. I get back into the conversation and he's back to being a ""wing man"" and even talking about his family who hasn't moved to MN yet. This happened a few times that night. The girl and I would later become friends and she told me how much of a creeper he was.

I would later find out that he befriended a bartender at OC invited her up to his apartment so he could loan her a book (at the time of both incidents he was staying at the Watertower apartments which is essentially attached to Old Chicago). She was reluctant at first but he seemed mostly harmless. She got up there and from what I understand he wouldn't let her leave until she threatened to call the police. He was forever referred to as ""Book club"" by the staff at OC.

I can't speak to him being a bigot but he's definitely a creeper.

It's a top academic university (I think top 25 of public schools as of the most recent releases) and often the top party school if you're into such activities. There are lots of great places to eat as people around here tend to avoid franchise food chains in favor of locally owned alternatives. If you like sporting events Iowa football games are quite the event, with tailgating often starting 4-5 hours before the games. Iowa basketball has been great this year (likely to be next year too) and our wrestling team is legendary.

Ayotte,WorldofTanks,1388697812.0,"Well, I would argue that a player's willingness to try hard or to play strong tanks is a factor in their ability to help their team win in the same sense as their knowledge of weak spots or vision mechanics.  I'm not saying that someone's win rate describes their best ability.  I'm only stating the seemingly basic fact that their win rate is their average chance to win a game.  If I play exclusively terrible tanks, I have a smaller ability to win games than someone who plays strong tanks, regardless of my hypothetical ""skill"" at WoT."
AFormidableContender,AskMen,1388697812.0,"&gt;Assuming you meant to write that ""men are not as easily manipulated as women"", the onus is on you to support this generalisation. We all mature at different rates, but in general an adult will be more able to manipulate a younger person. But your contention is that a young man is LESS easily manipulated than a young woman. I disagree! They are either as likely to be manipulated, as they have less life experience, or the girl will have been exposed to many more warnings and guidance than a young man. Her propensity to question the motivation of someone making overtures will be at least as great, and probably greater, than a young man. This sensitivity will be related to an awareness of the potential for manipulation; ""I am being seduced by someone in a position of authority!"" You claim the reverse based on....well you suggested which part of your anatomy your argument came from.

Firstly, this argument puts absolutely no stock in the differences in male and female sexuality. Women, especially young women have a significantly higher propensity for empathy and emotional intelligence. 

Couple that with the fact that the young men a female teacher typically go for are not anime nerds; they're usually athletes or otherwise attractive young boys, with testosterone surging through them, which desensitizes to some extent one's ability to be emotionally drawn in and are very used to having women, even older women, fawn over them or compliment them.

&gt;When teenagers enter puberty, they experience a range of physical and emotional changes. When a boy's voice changes, and he develops stubble, and starts to grow, we can see his development. Boys tend to feel awkward as they grow into their body, and adjust to their voice and hormonal drives.

That's a weird, overly general, bordering on obscure sentiment to up in a discussion about this. It sounds like something coming from an overly protective parent detached from reality. I certainly don't think people are as dumbstruck as you are making them appear. The changes to ones genitals can create awkward situations, obviously, like random boners...but I would certainly disagree that every teenager is a awkward, pimply dolt open for emotional manipulation. 

&gt; When a young woman starts puberty, she may develop a million insecurities, she may be anxious about her body, but outwardly she develops curves and the sexual allure that attracts interest from others. She will learn that men look at her, and talk to her and that men are interested in her body. She will also learn that some men are interested in her body for their sexual pleasure.

Wha...what...? Dude, I'm gonna be honest here...it sounds like everything you know about teenage boys and girls you read out of a  nutty sexual health text. That's not even an ad hom, I'm just saying I think you have some weird beliefs...

&gt;In general, teenage boys do not experience being sexually objectified as much as teenage girls. But maybe you and I visit different websites? The notion that boys are not hurt by sexual abuse by women is one of the myths that is being busted again and again. But many people cling to this myth, on the 'nudge nudge, wink wink' basis. try here[1] or here[2]

&gt;Sexual allure means that girls are aware of their sexual attraction before boys, as girls mature earlier than boys. Being self conscious about breasts which boys are staring at is a bit different than being self conscious about your penis which no one has ever seen but you.

Again, I would disagree with this under the premise that it does not account for the binary nature of female attraction towards males. What you're essentially doing is is throwing apples, oranges, and pears into the same basket and assuming the apples and the oranges are the same thing and creating generalities to suit all three. It's a fundamental flaw in every point you've made.

&gt;You then give an example of a straw man, relating the impact young men who perceive themselves to be attractive perceive that they have on young women. This is irrelevant. The post is about an older women developing a relationship with a younger male, not a peer to peer relationship.

It's not irrelavent, it's perfectly pertinent. Even if it was, I'm not sure how you can claim it's irrelavent and hold anything you've said above is more relevant. Attraction is not a choice, and the manner people deal with attraction doesn't change radically because one person is older or younger. If anything, the major factor being overlooked is the fact that the adult well knows fucking a student would be dangerous legally, and the student may or may not understand how serious it is as well. On that front, I will give you that a male student may not think much at all about the implications of getting caught as much as a teenage girl would. 

Therefore, when asked the question ""what would you do about your teen suck fucking his teacher"", we have to first assume my theoretical teen sex is attractive enough for a female teacher to want to risk her job and freedom to fuck him and go from there. "

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388697820.0,"&gt;I was asking a question on who calls consensual sex between two adults rape. You made it apparent that this is somehow happening a lot recently. This is not a failure to understand, this is me asking a question.

No, I did no such thing.  I pointed out that people have consensual sex at parties all the time, and thus two people having sex at a party is not at all unusual.  Nobody calls it rape when two people have consensual sex, and I never said anything of the sort.  It only gets called rape when there is some disagreement over whether the sex was consensual.  This is the point I was making, which you twisted into this bullshit about ""who calls consensual sex between two adults rape?""

&gt;Again, this isn't the topic of this CMV. OP is talking about RAPE. Actual rape, not hypothetical false allegations. **We aren't arguing what is rape and what isn't.** We are talking about whether girls who are raped deserve sympathy if they were at a party and drinking.

Therein lies the whole problem.  We **are** arguing about what is rape and what isn't, that's the whole reason this argument is occurring.  At no point in history before now was rape ever defined in such a way that it was possible to confuse sex and rape.  Only with the modern definitions of rape is it possible to define a woman going to a bacchanal, getting drunk, and getting laid as a rape victim.

That creates a real problem, because frankly I do not feel the same sympathy for a woman who was violently forced to have sex against her will, and a drunk twit who can't remember if she was coming on to the guy who boinked her or not.  Nor do I think it is remotely reasonable to ask me to have the same sympathy.

Much like I refuse to see the man who overpowers and forces sex on a woman through violence as essentially the same as a drunken frat boy who discovers in the morning that he assumed wrongly that the girl drunkenly groping at him, kissing him back, and pulling at her clothes in a desperate rush to get naked with him was consenting to sex

&gt;Sex is not the entire point of a modern day party. 

That's because we live in a delusional and idiotic culture full of miserably stupid people.  Sex is the entire point of the bacchanal, and if modern people engage in bacchanals with no expectation of sex, then modern people are idiots and it's no surprise that rapes are occurring.

Hell, the oldest symbols of the bacchanal are images of satyrs chasing nymphs and ""raping"" them.  If modern people engage in the exact same behavior that inspired the Greeks to invent the satyr and nymph, and then are surprised to find themselves acting like satyrs and nymphs, then one can only surmise that modern people are too fucking stupid to live.

&gt;Drunken debauched behaviours are things like loud arguments, yelling, showing off, and maybe if things get violent a fist fight.

Also groping, clumsy passes, and sloppy sex with strangers.  

I find it rather humorous that you want to remove sex entirely from the concept of debauchery, but I'm hardily going to pretend that you're making a real argument.  I mean seriously, debauchery means excessive indulgence in sensual pleasures; intemperance. The sexual connotations of debauchery are far stronger than any violent connotations.

&gt;But rape is not something that people should just expect and be ready for when they go to a party as a typical drunken behaviour.

No, **SEX** is  something that people should just expect and be ready for when they go to a party and drink heavily.  Rape only occurs when someone is foolish enough to buy into the nonsense you're peddling here, this ridiculous notion that drunken debauchery and the bacchanal are wholly divorced from sex.  

Rape is what happens when some twit gets drunk off her ass, flirts with strange guys, gives in to her base impulses, and decides she didn't mean to do that in the morning.  And before you go saying ""false allegations,"" I will point out that with the modern definition of rape, such an allegation would **not** be false.  Because rape no longer requires any ill intent or malice on the part of the rapist; one can rape entirely by accident and carelessness.

&gt;I get drunk semi-frequently. I don't rape people.

Are you a man?  Because if so, then the only reason you have not raped anyone (to your knowledge) is because you have gotten lucky.  Once you choose to attend such events and engage in drunkeness, whether you become a rapist or not is largely a matter of chance and circumstance.  You're *will* has little, if anything, to do with it."

DuneBug,allthingszerg,1388697838.0,"yes it would be good, but you're still going to have to deal with psi storm and archons. 

You're making two assumptions which i think are bad:

1. You assume that your army will do anything to his, he's going to storm the heck out of your brood lords and the archons are going to whomp on anything that comes close enough. The zerg army has no splash to speak of except fungal growth and your broodlings won't survive very long against archon/colossus.

2. You assume you'll re-max while he doesn't, but unless he's been turtling with no bank at all, he'll warp in more gateway crap. Some of those are likely to be templar, and some of those templar will be changed to archons. 

Mutas probably won't win the next battle. assuming he has even a few archons and storm clearly you can't group up your mutas into a nice little ball, so you're left doing some sort of magic box over top of his army, and that is not the ideal way to engage with mutas. It'd probably be better to use the mutas to just fly into his main and start base trading. If he moves his air away from his ground to do the same then come trade with the mutas.

However, I think there is a simpler way to derive your estimate, which often works for these kind of problems, by using the central limit theorem instead of Stirling's formula. I think the following method is simple enough that you can actually do it in your head, which often helps in real-life situations when you need to do a quick estimate of some probability.

Suppose X ~ Bin(2n, 0.5), and let Y be a normal random variable with the same mean and variance, and let f_Y be the pdf for Y. By the central limit theorem, X and Y have distributions that are approximately equal. Then the following are approximately equal:

* P(X = 50)
* P(49.5 &lt;= Y &lt;= 50.5), 
* f_Y(50)

and f_Y(50) = 1/sqrt(2\*pi\*sigma²), where sigma² = 2n \* 1/4 is the variance of X. And so the answer is approximately 1/sqrt(n\*pi)."

I then hobbled back into the street, retrieved shoe, and hobbled into work 30 minutes late. I then had to explain this story to my boss. And as DEAD SERIOUS as I was--- it just sounded like a far-fetched story.

joethesaint,AskReddit,1388697971.0,"Firstly, the government hasn't done anything of the sort; ISPs made their own decisions to do it (not my ISP though, as it happens). David Cameron was keen to encourage them to do this, but it's not censorship, as it is entirely optional. You install your new internet package, and it asks you if you'd like to install the filter. 

Obviously there are people out there who don't control their internet, and whose parents or whoever have decided to have the filter. For those people it is a problem because the filters are imperfect and block some websites which shouldn't be blocked. This needs rectifying. But it's wrong to insinuate that it's a government initiative, because it isn't, and it's wrong to call it censorship as well. 

I'll add that if you're under 18 and you're pissed off that you can't access porn, you don't really have grounds to complain because you're not legally allowed to view porn anyway. That'd be like criticising a bartender for refusing to sell you alcohol with a fake ID."

ANewMachine615,AskScienceFiction,1388698004.0,"To step OOC for a second: One of the points that Tolkien makes several times in the series is the inherent self-destructiveness of evil. The best example of this is Ungoliant, the great spider-queen that Melkor allies with to attack Valinor and destroy the Two Trees. Ungoliant devours light and beautiful things because she is insatiably hungry, and belches out clouds of darkness, and spins webs of shadow. She literally unmakes everything simply to feed her need to unmake. In the end, it's whispered, she actually eats herself (as self-destructive as you get) in her hunger.

That's pretty well comparable to other evils. For instance, Melkor becomes less and less personally powerful over time, because he wants to dominate other wills. To accomplish this, he literally spends his spirit in his followers, sacrificing small pieces of his own power to bring them under his dominion more fully. After the attack on Valinor, he has spent so much power in Ungoliant that he can no longer cloak himself in a fair guise. After he returns to Middle-Earth and seeks to become its Dark Lord, he loses the power to heal himself, and walks forever limping thanks to Fingolfin's attacks. Eventually, he is so personally weak that, whereas it once took all the Valar together to beat him in a fight, in the War of Wrath he is defeated by Elves and a single Maiar. All of this because, in seeking to fulfill his goal of domination, he has fatally undermined himself. That is the nature of evil in Arda.

Sauron is the same way. He is eventually undone because he wanted to command the Elves, and so created the One Ring to control their lesser Rings. If he hadn't created the Ring, he would've won the War of the Ring and conquered all. If he had, though, he'd have just found another way to destroy himself -- perhaps trying to ""order"" the winds and weather to his liking, and spending his spirit to nothing in the attempt. Something like that, certainly."

komnenos,AskMen,1388698076.0,"Lets call her K

K and I met over the summer while taking an intensive language course.  Now as soon as I got in the room the first day I found her attractive, but hey, there are always going to be attractive girls in a class!  

K and I hit it off pretty fast and started hanging out after class fairly frequently.  I remember one time K was helping me memorize a script for a skit we were doing the next day.  We started at around three in the afternoon and went until twelve at night (I'm really slow at memorizing that sort of stuff).  We did well on the skit the next day and we hung out everyday after that.  I miss it so much.  At every party we went to we would hold hands and cuddle.  One time I even made out with her, it felt so good I almost wanted to cry.  I just felt so wonderful being near someone in this way.

Fast forward a month and a half, our last class ended and our classmates had a party.  After the party was done she drove me home (she was the designated driver).  When we got to my house I told her that I enjoyed being with her and I wanted to see more of her once she got back from seeing her parents in Korea.  She smiled and said, ""yeah sure, of course.""

She was gone for a month.  Nothing felt right, I went to my cousin's wedding and I felt sad the entire time seeing this happy couple, god I wanted to be with K so badly.  Her skin is so soft and she actually enjoyed listening to me.

She gets back and I call her up asking if she was busy.  ""I'm with my parents now for the week, but I'll be free next week.""  The next week goes by and I send her a Facebook message ""hey are you busy?""  She got back to me right away, ""Komnenos... I read your other messages and I just have to say that I just don't feel that way towards you at the moment.""  She went on to say ""I hope I am reading your messages the wrong way, and if I am then forgive me for being silly :).""  I was devastated, I hadn't seen her smile, talked about history, growing up, weird things that had happened in our lives, watched movies or talked about books in over five weeks.  I wanted to be with her so badly.  ""K do you think we could still hang out?""  ""No I don't think that would be for the best.""  I broke down behind the monitor, I told her how much she meant to me, how when she told me words of affection in Korean told me that she felt them towards me it had made my month.  When she said I was more then a friend I thought that meant something.  And here she was telling me it meant nothing.  I told her of those experiences and she just told me that she was ""being silly.""  What the hell does that mean?  Who says that I'm more then a friend to them and not mean it?  She reiterated that she did care for me, she said that if she didn't she wouldn't have answered my messages or picked up the phone when I called her.  She wished me the best of luck, ""your a very nice funny guy Komnenos, and the most genuine person I have ever met.""  Then why don't you want to go out with me?

I felt sad for two months afterwards, I dreamt almost every night about hanging out with her.  I used to enjoy my dreams but here I was dreading them.  I cried all the time, some days I'd wake up and not a single happy thought went throughout the day.  I haven't seen her since august 23rd, I still think about her, the thoughts aren't as bad and I'm starting to trust women again.  Every memory from the past few months seems farther away then the ones I had with her.  I've gone out with several girls since her, but none of them are the right combination like her, they don't have skin as soft as her, they don't laugh like she does, they don't smile like she smiles and they can't keep up a conversation or care like she did.  I've started going out with another girl who was an incredibly good friend of mine, I love her so so much but K pops into my mind so often and it frustrates me to no bounds.  I wish I had never met her.  I still have days where I wake up and feel like shit because of memories of her, I still dream about her.

That's not the point, and it's completely untrue. Otherwise baby-rape would be a victimless crime. The fact is that, against your consent, you were a perfectly healthy baby boy with perfectly fine genitals. Then your parents, for some reason, (I'm assuming because your dad is cut, so he decided you should be too) let a stranger clamp your penis and cut a very important part off it. The penis head wasn't designed to be exposed to the air. Imagine not being able to moisten your tongue, and having it forced outside all the time.

sagradia,infj,1388698134.0,"If you are playing video games with your friend to keep him happy because he has problems, what are you frustrated about? Sometimes presence is more useful than words, especially if your words are falling on deaf ears. However, it is everyone's responsibility to seek treatment for their own wounds, and a gentler suggestion or nudging might help them to get the process started. It is inconceivable that a friend would let his friend's wounds fester without offering to help and share enabling perspectives.

Again, video games as a form of escape take us away from focusing on our real life problems. Momentary pleasure is good, but helping your friend to find long term happiness is even better."

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1388698149.0,"&gt;Given the prominence of polish migrants coming to the UK in the mid-2000s, what are your thoughts on other groups who can now move to the UK (such as Bulgarians)?

My approach to them is similar to the approach of decent British person - if you want to move here, contribute and integrate then you are very welcome. If somehow millions of them would like to come here (can't and won't happen with Romania and Bulgaria having together 29mln) some limits need to be imposed. I understand perfectly that sudden changes in numbers of population can be a big struggle to society. 1.5% throughout 10 years from most of Eastern Europe is not that much. If somehow that figure was to go to let's say 10 or 20% then it is something to be worried about. That's why immigration from outside of EU needs to be tight (1.3bln people in India, 1bln in China - probably at least half would move straight away anywhere West if they had a chance).

&gt;Has living in the UK for 10 years changed your attitude to immigration?

Don't forget that Poland is a rather conservative country. In my city there were like 3 people who came originally from Africa (one doctor, one his son, one basketball player) but that never was an issue for anybody there (in fact getting to that doctor was a privilege as he was very good). In larger cities it was supposedly not uncommon for a foreigner (especially one which after just looking at you knew he came from overseas) to be subjected for some racial remarks. But this was probably years ago and is no longer a bigger case now.

I've noticed however that in UK integration doesn't always work. By using ""liberal"" views some put actual oppression of certain groups as legal (I'll say it - women and burkhas, abortion due to gender, arranged marriages etc). This just shouldn't be allowed or there should be proper programs fighting with that inequality. One extra thing I learned is that it's obvious that people who come from a country where war (so crime, killings etc) is something normal will most probably have an increased risk of copying their actions in the new country. UK can't allow to say it publicly now as it's ""racist"". I don't mean saying and treating differently someone who comes from country x specifically different but at some national, government regulated level it should be used to solve the issue and for example increase integration of certain groups of people."

wanderer_of_roads,Fitness,1388698309.0,"PHAT is one of the only strength/hyptertrophy programs that I know of (there are others I'm sure but this is the only one I have done). But it sounds like you are are interested in more than that. What I have found to be effective is supplemental exercise. I stick to my program (3-5 days a week lifting heavy) but mix in things like running, yoga, advanced stretching programs, martial arts, etc for whatever my current goals are. For instance if I feel a bit stiff I will add in more stretching and maybe do some yoga for a month or two. The important thing is to make sure it doesn't interfere too much with your regular routine. 

For your reference I have been doing a PHAT variant for the past few years. I got to where I wanted to be in strength and transitioned to body building. I do the heavy compound lifts to maintain my strength but focus more on size and mobility.

You may have to develop your own or work with a trainer to build your own routine based on your goals if they are something like strength/endurance. "

Look at the biggest screen plays there and you'll see Rice sealing a DB and maintaining the block with those long arms of his.   Chop Chop is great and all, but he can't block like that. 

If you look at the tape since Rice went down you'll see a few screen attempts where Chop Chop can't block his man and Tate is forced to make a guy miss BEHIND the line of scrimmage and caught within a yard or two by the active pursuit.  If we had a blocker allow Tate to get some speed a few yards past the LOS, the defense is forced on its heals and must focus on contain.  Tates remarkable lateral movement eats those defenses alive but when the first tackler can dictate where Tate has to go, the defense can attack and you get -1 to 3 yard plays. "

Its up to her to be willing to communicate with her owner and decide what to do from there if he is unreceptive to such communication.

Sometimes the best lessons are indeed learned the hard way.


From the prospective of a friend; if she is unwilling to do anything about her situation pointing out what she probably already knows but is unwilling to admit probably is not going to help. You can be there to support her if she asks for help moving, searching for an apartment etc but you can't and shouldn't in any way ""pressure"" her over it. All that will happen if you do so without her being ready is that she will bring it all back to your owner, he will ""unfriend"" you and the girl will end up even *more* isolated.

She is venting, that's great, but most of the people I have seen go through these situations vent a lot before they are ready to do anything about , if they ever are that is.


Its painful to watch; I have seen several of my friends go through this on both sides of the coin but if you don't let people learn lessons for themselves they will just keep making the same mistakes. I made the rookie mistake once of trying to protect a friend from an abusive owner who would disappear for weeks and months on end without any communication and all that solved was I lost a friend and she still ended up swindled out of about 100K a few years down the line. 

My two cents, be available if the girl decides to come to you otherwise just bide your time.

superior22,summonerschool,1388698584.0,"The main thing you seem to forget, everyone fits into their role. Rengar and Jax can only insta-gib squishy carries. Carries like Jayce or ADC's are squishy as fuck. That's why they're ranged. Rengar and Jax have to get into melee range to insta-kill them. If the front line (Jax, Rengar) is able to get into melee range to the backline (ADC's, pretty much every ranged champion) you're already so out of position you don't even deserve to survive. They should never be able to get into melee range. If they do that's a misplay on your part. One of the reasons kiting is so important. You take half of their health before they even reach you. Take basketball for comparison. A 7'0"" center will probably block every shot/dunk attempt of an 6'5"" guard in a 1v1. Because they're not meant to play 1v1 against each other. The front line (Rengar, Jax) is not meant to fight the back line 1v1.

They can only 100-0 squishy targets. If you keep your positioning up, have decent vision and just know what goes on they'll not get into melee range. A Rengar can't insta-kill another front liner if he doesn't go full damage. A front liner is meant to fight another front liner, not the back line."

But you're making that impossible.  Being willfully obtuse **is** a problem with the argument.

&gt;When you accuse someone of being ""willfully obtuse"" or ""playing dumb"" or anything else, you're sabotaging the intent of this sub because you're making the other user entrench further into their view, rather than listen and consider how they might be wrong.

Then you might as well ban people for suggesting that anyone anywhere could ever possibly be wrong, since suggesting that people could be wrong causes some people to entrench.

See, the problem here is that when someone is being willfully obtuse, *they have already entrenched*.  There is no rational, persuasive argument that can be made to such a person.  That's what being willfully obtuse means, it means making oneself impervious to reason and persuasion.  The only way to overcome such a position is to point out what the person is doing, and hoping they have enough intellectual integrity to be shamed into arguing fairly.

Nognix,AskReddit,1388698630.0,"No problem. Don't take my clarification as the definition for introversion/extraversion though. There is no clear definition for both but most people use the general rule I explained above when it comes to explaining the differences in social interaction between introverts and extraverts. There isn't a consensus concerning a good definition amongst people dealing with human psychology.

I guess you could say the *safest* definition is the one coined by Jung himself, the person who ""invented"" both words. His definition for introversion is (and I'm just quoting Wikipedia here.): ""an attitude-type characterised by orientation in life through subjective psychic contents (focus on one's inner psychic activity)"" while his definition for extraversion says: ""an attitude type characterised by concentration of interest on the external object"", (the outside world).""

Not a very practical definition though. Come join us over at the [personality type subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/mbti+ISTJ+ISFJ+INFJ+INTJ+ISTP+ISFP+INFP+INTP+ESTP+ESFP+ENFP+ENTP+ESTJ+ESFJ+ENFJ+ENTJ) if you're interested! :)"

With other games, you are usually only banned from public matches or servers and still get full access to single player. If or when hackers get banned, they are still free to play around in single player and in private games with friends. For older games such as halo2, this was an easy pick because you only played custom games with friends 90% of the time. On top of that, you can do far more than just cheat wins or stats in most games. You can often create really creative and new stuff or have odd fun doing what the game normally does not allow. A gun shooting trees that form a bridge to heaven is far more fun than it may sound. Also, my favorite reason, I find the tears of people who complain and talk trash to be so delicious!!!

BombadeerStudios,funny,1388698716.0,"I used to have a couple when I lived in New Hampshire, though at the time I was pretty much living on a farm. They weren't indoor goats or anything, but they were still technically pets as we had them for no other purpose than fun (and a learning experience for a much younger me at the time).  
Miniature or small goats wouldn't be too bad as a pet (some breeds can get up to the size of an alpaca/pony), if you have a decent yard and clean up after them. Consider the general maintenance to be about on par with a dog, with higher/more difficult vet bills (depending on what you have around you), and a greater challenge to find appropriate food. I think you can house train them? I'm not sure...it seems like it would be difficult to me. In that way they might be more similar to rabbits. In the end I'd think it easier to just have a 'back yard goat' as it were. They're very social animals, so you'd want another animal of some kind to keep them company for while you're away (they get along with most things, so long as they grow up with them).  
In the end it's probably not worth it unless you live on a farm, compared to a dog or something. They don't smell, but their urine is strong. Their poop is super easy to deal with, but they do it a lot, all over the place, without care. They're very clever and can be a lot of fun, but they're also master escape artists and can be very stubborn. They don't eat anything as old cartoons would have you believe, but they chew a lot and nibble to see what things are. And if they don't have regular access to fresh greens (they prefer young leaves) they'll eat bark/chew on wood (like on your house, or a fence). They killed a lot of trees in our fields once they ran out of leaves to eat by eating all the bark off them, and tore quite a few of the old wooden shingles off our shed."

You're never going to convince anyone by being an asshole.

&gt;Upper level jobs are HUGELY biased towards men.

Oooooh I know this one. If you are talking about women who have children, you are right. Raising one or more kids is time consuming and many women who have kids choose to sacrifice their career to raise them. Some don't let their kids get in the way, but the fact that there are many who *do*, skews the statistics.

Also, funny tangent, I've been to trade school. You go there to, for example, to become a plumber, electrician, locksmith, etc. In the entire student body of 400, there were 3 women.

Basically, what I've been trying to illustrate is that some modern feminist groups like to push for things like equal opportunity and I'm cool with the idea, but the execution is terrible. Recently, In Canada, the minimum fitness requirements have been lowered in the Armed Forces to ""encourage"" women to enlist. The same was done for firefighters and police officers. If you can't see the potential harm and danger this causes then I don't know what else to tell you

&gt; Are you some sort of male supremacist acting out of the local high school?

Yeah, you're not very good at this whole ""respect"" thing, are you? If you must know, no I'm not. I would describe myself as a egalitarian.

&gt; Can't take someone saying that all our inequalities aren't solved yet, even though they say many are?

I'm not even sure what this is asking (pardon my English, second language and all that). Who's *they*? saying what?"

wolf123450,bjj,1388698765.0,"FYI I'm a white belt with two stripes, been practicing jiu-jitsu for about 6 months.  I wrestled in high school and found the BJJ club at my university, then took the BJJ class offered here.  I watch a lot of videos on youtube, I look up books, and I ask people about moves I see when rolling.  I don't try to master every single thing I see, but I think it's a good idea to know it's out there, so I can at least defend against it.  Also it's helped me find the few moves that I do like and incorporate into my style.  Often I find that a move I saw doesn't work for me, so I move on and remember how to defend against it.

Also, whenever I get into something I'm not sure about while rolling, I go home and look it up on youtube.  It's helped me so far, I won first place in the absolute white belt division at a local tournament.  My final match I won with an arm bar from broken scarf hold, which I learned from youtube.  I looked that up because I ended up in that position a lot, and just didn't know what to do.

The way I see it, knowledge is power.  Learning about a bunch of moves on youtube isn't going to detract from your Jiu Jitsu skills, it's just going to broaden your repertoire, as long as you train right.  I agree with you that the idea of jiu jitsu is not to know 100 moves at 10%, but rather to know 10 moves at 100%.  I think youtube helps in finding which 10 moves work best for you."

VooDooBarBarian,Calgary,1388698937.0,"It does indeed refer explicitly to a group of ethnic tribes who self-identify as Roma. All other uses have evolved from that root. ""Gypsy"" comes from a time when they were believed to have originated in Egypt and is descended from the Greek word for ""Egyptian"". When used to describe someone it seems intended to draw attention to perceived negatives in the Roma culture.

For example, in this day and age, nobody who felt they had been short changed would say they ""got jewed"", but most people wouldn't even bat an eye if someone described the same situation as ""getting gypped"".

I'm even willing to grant that in North America, normal usage isn't generally negative, and more people would think of Esmeralda from Disney's version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame than of some shiftless lowlife. Even in this specific case, ""Gypsy cab"" conjures (in my mind anyway) something more akin to The Scarlet Pimpernel, a dashing rogue flouting an unjust law.

However, in many parts of Europe, they are still being actively denigrated, to the point that certain surnames will prevent you from getting work.

wanderer_of_roads,Fitness,1388698986.0,"My method is probably not correct but this is what I do (please critique):

Strength: I switch from 5x5 to 2x5 or 3x5 with additional sets at a lower weight (3x10). I believe this allows me to continue lifting the same weight on a few heavy work sets without taxing myself too much, meanwhile the additional hypertrophy range sets help keep size. 

Size: Everything gets extra sets. If I would normally do 3x10 I do 5x10. If I fail, I lower the weight and attempt more. If I fail at that weight I go lighter. I will also do burn out sets on extremely light weight (Bicep curls with 15lb dumbbells). I do this on a bulk as well but find that during a cut lowering the weight is a must. I can often do 3x10 at my goal weight on a bulk but on a cut only complete 1.5x10 and then have to lower the weight after failing.

I have done this for several years. Is this completely retarded? It's worked for me. "

I should also point out veigar's combo takes over 2/3 of his mana pool to execute early. his passive doesn't really help eithe rif oyu odn't build mana/manaregen and simply servers to make him able to lasthit with q when low on mana while giving him no real threat. in comparison nasus is a lategame champ that has to simply survive laning and midgame and will win the game by default if it goes later.

even when most fed veigar can at most take out 2 people from the opposing team in a standard teamfight and in order to hit his w he generally has to use his stun to hold down the enemy. veigar is incredibly weak to getting dove and if he uses his stun to save his own life he sacrifices a huge portion of his burst damage.

tl:dr veigar is strong in the midgame(level 10-15) and then again in the ultra-late game(40+ minutes) while nasus is strong from 20 minutes onwards and is able to more safely carry games while strong."

Just because we like something in fan works doesn't mean we want it in the show.

As I've said in the past about this question, I've read and enjoyed shipfics, gorefics, clopfics, HiE fics, ponies-on-Earth fics, fics where characters died permanently, fics where the CMC got their cutie marks, and so on. I loved them a lot, but do I want them to be canon? No, of course not! That's the sad, confused irony of Equestria Girls: noone asked for the main cast to become human. The showmakers confused human art as wanting humans on the show, which I think is obviously wrong but apparently isn't.

To me, that's the point of fan works: to explore what the main work can't. I can write a fic about, say, [Twilight disproving magic](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/117741/its-impossible), confident in the fact that something so bizarre won't appear in the show. FiW can make Sweetie Belle a robot; a cool concept, but it obviously won't appear on the show. Fics and fanart can explore love, death, sex, tragedy, and that which would be too deep or out of the ratings level of FiM, and we the fans can enjoy the idea without desecrating the original show."

StopTalkingOK,SubredditDrama,1388699090.0,"I know I already replied to you but I felt the need to weigh in as a 10%er. Former fire team leader and Combat vet here (yes real combat, not sipping kool-aid at the pool down in Kuwait). I have concerns with women in light infantry roles. Combat is many faceted and can mean anything from slinging rounds into a howitzer to assaulting an objective after 12 miles of movement to contact. It can be as strenuous as taking naps in an MRAP during daily route clearance or 8 hour foot patrols. ""Combat"" needs to be qualified and is entirely role dependant. 

Take the following scenario from the only other MOS I consider to be grunt-worthy (mounted cavalry). Your job is to conduct road patrols and you spend about 80% of your time in a vehicle. You ensure freedom of movement by looking for people emplacing IEDs, you conduct presence patrols through villages, you interact with local law enforcement and military, you sometimes do a cordon and knock, you occasionally conduct planned raids, you rarely (edit: meaning it rarely happens, when it does happen you react 60% of the time, every time. #YOLO) react to contact. *However* you are usually within 1k and almost never more than 2k from your vehicle and backup. 

Light infantry on the other hand could be much more physically demanding as you will still do much of the above but most of your time will be spent on foot and that MEDEVAC could require you to carry 250 lbs (190 body weight, 60 lbs in gear) for a full 6k back to the ORP for exfil. Can a woman do this? Sure, why not, if they are capable then let them give it a shot. *However* do **NOT** lower the standards to a lower baseline and do **NOT** have unequal standards based on gender in combat roles. 

At the beginning of this I stated that I have concerns with women in combat, if you've read this far without dismissal I'll explain. The issue is avoiding the possibility of falling or inequal standards for people are expected to have the same capability. Especially considering our standards have fallen steadily for the past decade to curb attrition. Lowered equal standards place the team in danger and jeapordize the mission. Inequal standards place the team in danger, jeapordize the mission, and is divisive to a group of people are supposed to act as a single cohesive unit, cogs in a machine. It hurts morale. 

Everything else being equal I would have been proud to have a woman killing machine on my team.

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,AdviceAnimals,1388699179.0,"If I can add, as a person with chronic pain, the key with opiates and pain killers is to use them not as a way to feel warm and fuzzy but as a tool to feel the absence of pain. There is a difference. If you are looking to feel warm and fuzzy you will start to crave that feeling and start to chase the buzz. If you use them to feel less pain there is no buzz to chase. Your body is just less taxed by the stress of pain and you are able to follow through with the exercises and physical therapy needed to get better and not need the pills at all.

If you start to feel a buzz, it might mean you are taking too much or taking your doses too quickly and they are overlapping. For anyone with a sense of self preservation be aware of this and reevaluate. Pain medication is an amazing tool and can allow a person to do what is necessary to get better. It can also be abused. Too often people think that it is inevitable to feel high while on painkillers. They don't understand that the balance you are aiming for is to feel nothing. Meaning not pain but also not good/buzz. 

Everything else you spoke about I completely agree. As much as I hate having a chronic condition, it has forced me to deal with things and learn how to live a healthier and happier life. Ultimately it has made me a better person and more empathetic towards others. "

Mainly though, gearing the object of one's life toward service and ""doing the right thing"", giving instead of receiving, and cultivating empathy and concern for other people instead of yourself are the surest ways to find a profound sense of an otherwise meaningless life. 

For, truly, happiness is an end in itself, and in a world with so much suffering, there is a clear set of marching orders, a challenge that only needs to be taken on. This is the source of meaning in life, in my modest opinion, but I don't credit myself for the wisdom, instead look to the world's ""saints"": the Dalai Lama, the Pope, and historical inspiration like Buddha and Jesus.

Of course this is the Internet and what sounds like a panacea is not, but rather a lifelong vocation. But the road to happiness never was meant to be easy. It is that which is hard, but worthwhile, that brings a sense of peace and purpose.

~~2) the distinction of a consensual conversation between an officer and a citizen is the citizen has the right to leave at any point in time. If the citizen is being detained, they do not. By asking certain questions, it establishes what type of contact it is.~~

If an officer asks you to (voluntary) perform an action, and it is not established the person is being detained, then an officer can claim in court the contact was consensual. **(and that the suspects rights were not violated)**

It is important to know what is and is not a legal command, and depending on what outcome a person wants in the contact, before ignoring an officers order. However, by knowing what rights you may always maintain, it will allow you to avoid surrendering your rights voluntarily, even if the request sounded like a command by the officer. 

'You don't mind if I look in your bag do you? HAND IT HERE'

Notice how in the above sentence the question (do you consent to a search) has been answered with yes by following the order of the officer. But by simply asking 'are you ordering me to hand over the bag, or asking me?' it helps define what the officer is saying.

In the case presented by OP it could be 'You don't mind if I look inside your car do you? UNLOCK YOUR DOORS'

Geohump,Christianity,1388699511.0,"There are a lot of people who are anti-religion, for very good reasons. Remember that religion is how humans organize their traditions of worship.

Because all of that is set up by humans it gets abused a lot. People use these artificial traditions they have created inside their religions to abuse and exploit each other. So there are a lot of good reasons to be anti-religion, but that doesn't mean that you don't have faith or that you're not Christian. It simply means your anti-religion.

For example, I am anti-religion regarding the extreme fundamentalist Islamists. I don't believe in stoning people! I'm also anti-religion regarding some extreme fundamentalist Christian sects.

I would never use a training technique that actually *hurts* the dog - even when the ecollar gets used on the show he uses the vibrate setting which is good. If the dog is yelping and cowering, you're doing it wring. Dead wrong :(.  "
BeachBumHarmony,AskMen,1388699580.0,"My best friend told me he was falling for me. It sucked. I had told him plenty of times that he was like a brother to me, like family. I cried, because I really did value his friendship - but couldn't give him more. We were best friends. We would hang out all the time, play video games, watch movies, etc. 

This sucks to say, but I was never physically attracted to him and that's what made me never consider a relationship. He was/is a great guy. He would have done anything for me. He did do loads of wonderful things for me (always tried to make me feel special). But I couldn't get over the fact that I never wanted to kiss him. I didn't want to cuddle with him. I didn't want to hold his hand. 

We tried keeping the friendship (for another 2-3 years), but he eventually permanently moved to the city he had attended college in. We don't talk anymore and haven't really spoken in 2 years. 

I'm in a serious relationship (2.5 years together) now with a guy who is like him in so many ways - same type of humor, same confidence. But I'm very attracted to my boyfriend. "
Taurath,videos,1388699581.0,"The kids in their teens and 20s right now are the first generation to spend the majority of their time sifting through vast amounts of information than seeking the presence of new information out.

In fact this led to a funny incident. I was at Mcdonalds and the server was handing me the drinks, I had one drink in my hand and as I was about to take the second drink off him, I said 'thank you', so he said 'cheers mate', and I was puzzled.

Its a giant pissing match over which gender society shits on the most.

Modern feminism is becoming toxic imho and MRM is often just reactionary against feminism. I don't see why everyone can't just drop the gendered movements and realize that in modern western culture and law neither sex is oppressed, we have societal issues and views on gender that give both positive and negative to both men and women so there is no use in having this pissing match against each other.

ecclectic,Welding,1388699782.0,"We'll see.  The welding program has been in a state of flux since before I started welding 9 years ago.  My instructor was pretty frustrated with what was going on even then.  In some ways, it SHOULD be a good way to go, companies should be contributing to the training of new tradesmen, that's how it's been for centuries.  Because most of what we need to know can't *really* be learned/taught in a classroom environment beyond just a basic understanding.

For people in the trade already, hopefully the transition will be fairly transparent, aside from the pipe/pressure and TIG stuff, there isn't THAT much that's 'new' going from C-B.  

People panic and assume that they're trying to dumb down the curriculum to make it more digestible to people, I don't think that's likely to be the case, most of the instructors I've met were pretty dedicated to making sure that no student gets through without knowing what they need to.  How much is retained after they finish is another story, but that goes for everything from art majors to medical practicioners.

There were a significant amount of people who had multiple barriers to being allowed to vote, and with each new law, a hurdle was struck down. To act as though the 19th amendment allowed ""all women"" to vote is overly simplistic, but to act as though the laws you reference would have allowed all members of those ethnic groups to vote without the 19th amendment, or other laws (such as those regarding property ownership), already being in place, to vote, is similarly inaccurate.

ANewMachine615,AskScienceFiction,1388699844.0,"One of the biggest points is that Mordor is safe, and the Old Forest is dangerous.

Well, Mordor is not safe. The very air is a slow poison, and the water as well. It is normally full of bustling armies of orcs. The only reason two unarmed hobbits are able to cross is because those bustling armies of orcs are drawn off by the army of Gondor and Rohan coming to the Black Gate. Further, the hobbits survive only because one of them has the good sense/luck to ask for light and water, both of which they receive as a dispensation from the Powers of the world. Mordor is, even when the hobbits are crossing it, probably the least hospitable part of the world south of frozen Forochel. It's incredibly dangerous. Foolish, even.

Second, the world in general is dangerous, but that proves nothing. Galadriel lives cheek-and-jowl with a huge horde of orcs, and a Balrog, over in Moria. Rivendell, the Last Homely House of the gentle elf-lord Elrond, is in the middle of a howling wilderness, and carved out solely by the power of the Ring that Elrond bears. Both of these are Good People, capitals included.

Elrond's lack of familiarity is not exceptional. Elves are, to put it mildly, rather self-centered in terms of the lore they care about. Ask him to name all the Kings of the Noldor, and he could likely tell you without stopping to think. Ask him to give you all the names of Varda, and he could sing you a great song listing them. Ask him to name the forefathers of Thorin back to Durin I the Deathless... maybe he misses one or two. Ask him to give you the last three Mayors of the Shire, and he'd not even know what the question was about. Tom is insular, by all appearances, only speaking to those who appeal to him in some way. Not at all weird that Elrond would not have heard of him, and would only know a Sindarin name for him.

&gt;it is said more than once that the willows are the most powerful and evil trees in the Forest

No, Old Man Willow is the meanest tree. Trees themselves are not inherently evil or powerful. A single willow.

&gt;Yet, the rhyme that Bombadil teaches the hobbits to use in conjuring up Bombadil himself includes the line, “By the reed and willow.” The willows are a part of Bombadil’s power and a means of calling on him. They draw their strength from the cursed river Withywindle, the centre of all the evil in the Forest.

Ah yes, the cursed Withywindle, home of the beautiful and apparently not evil at all Goldberry. He keeps asserting that the Withywindle is evil, but I see no evidence of that. Do you?

&gt;I suggest that she is a Willow tree conjured into human form, a malevolent huorn like the Old Man Willow from whom the hobbits have just escaped.

Conjured by what power? Taking on a human form is not an attribute of a huorn that we see. This is a huge jump, and doesn't explain her parentage (she's said to be the daugher of the River), or anything about her. It also requires that willows are always evil, an assertion without evidence.

&gt;There is a boundary around Bombadil’s country that he cannot or will not pass, something that confines him to a narrow space. And in return, no wizard or elf comes into his country to see who rules it, or to disturb the evil creatures that gather under his protection.

Will not. My theory has always been that Bombadil poured his spirit into his realm, as Sauron poured his into the Ring, and Melkor before him did to the whole of Arda. We know that Maia can do this (Melian does it with the Girdle around Doriath in the First Age, for instance), so whatever-Tom-is can probably do it as well.

&gt;Do I think that Tolkien planned things in this way? Not at all, but I find it an interesting speculation.

That, I think, is the most telling. It's basically an admission that he doesn't take this seriously himself."

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388699853.0,"&gt;Since it is impolitic to outright demand raising taxes on the public, they have masked their goal in the form of expressing ""outrage"" over the supposed soaring economic inequality in America.

This assumes that liberals wish to raise taxes simply to raise taxes, and not to actually address income inequality.  The problem with this line of argument is that no reason is given for why liberals would want to raise taxes, except the hidden assumption that liberals are just mean old meanies.

Perhaps the liberal outrage over soaring income inequality is not a mask at all, but genuine outrage over soaring income inequality.

&gt;Alternatives like educational choice is verboten as it conflicts with the teachers unions.

More speculation as to motive.  Is it impossible that teachers are opposed to charter schools because they are clearly an attempt to privatize and monetize public education and turn it into a new stream of corporate welfare?

&gt;North Korea has very low inequality, but nobody thinks it's a beacon of harmony.

What?  North Korea is one of the most unequal societies in the world.

&gt;While America is more unequal than most countries, it has also the highest standard of living, excluding tiny countries like Switzerland.

The concern is that as America moves towards greater and greater income inequality, it will more and more resemble third world nations where there is great income inequality and a high levels of misery.

neekz0r,explainlikeimfive,1388699973.0,"First, you used the wrong terminology. Even the people who don't advocate file sharing use the term ""piracy"" now. The difference between piracy and stealing is that in piracy, you don't deprive the owner of the original object. In other words, if I have a muffin, and you steal it, I can't sell the muffin. In piracy, if I have a muffin, you clone the muffin. I can sell it or I can keep it. The only difference is I (probably) won't be able to sell it to *you*.

When you sell information, which is basically what content is, there is no supply limit. Unlike in muffins, where only so many can be produced, once content is there (thanks to the internet) it's supply is unlimited. Therefor, supply and demand -- the basis for price setting -- is not really applicable to price. 

Content creators then have to do something silly: they have to *artificially* limit supply. They do this any number of ways. The most popular example being HBO's Game of Thrones. They only allow it on cable and DVD/Bluray. 

Your whole argument, though, is mistaken. Only very few people advocate that everything should be free. Most people advocate for something much more fair to content creators: content when they want it at a reasonable price with the bulk of the money going to the content creators.

We went to the bar and were dancing and having a generally good time. Fast forward to a house party at Sig Tau. They put me in an upstairs bedroom because I was super wasted and all I wanted to do was fall asleep. My friend came up to check on me, and I had pulled down my white shorts and was pissing on the guy's brand-new chair. Apparently I thought I was in the bathroom. I flipped back onto the bed to pass out and one of the guys laughed, jokingly slapped my butt, and said ""Well, at least you've got clean britches!"" They got everything cleaned up (and I'm grateful I didn't shit or anything), but I was so horrified when they told me about it the next day.

That puts her in the small margin of less than 3% of the world's female population.  Next, less than 5% of the world population has blue eyes, and the bulk of them do not have the pale blue eyes that she has.  There are various other traits which set her, and other super models like her, apart from the general population.

JohnTesh,BitcoinMarkets,1388700026.0,"Interchange fees are the percentage of a credit card transaction that visa/mastercard/discover/amex/etc take out of the transaction, in addition to whatever your bank or merchant account provider charges (which in Overstock's case I would assume to be several basis points at the very most due to their volume). The credit card companies themselves make the bulk of the fees, and for smaller retailers all of this can add up to upwards of 3% of the total price of the sale. Larger retailers can negotiate it down, but the floor does seem to be somewhere around 2%. 

It is also not uncommon for large, general goods retailers to net 2% or less - amazon runs a slightly negative profit, and walmart and target are each in that 2-3% net profit range.

The reason he will convert to cash immediately is that the speculation is not worth jacking up the cash flow. If you are trying to collect money for things within your terms (i.e. collect from the customer on day two when the product ships and pay the vendor on day 30 when the invoice is due), the possible upswing is not worth the operational nightmare that would occur if you lost, say, 10% in a 3 week period (let alone 50%). He needs cash because his vendors take cash, his employees take cash, and the government requires cash for taxes, and these are all priced in dollars. Bitcoin is not yet useful for these things. No bank is going to extend a huge line of credit against your bitcoin holdings, and he could destroy the business financially if he doesn't convert immediately (if bitcoin becomes a significant percentage of payments, that is). This is not a vote of no confidence for bitcoin, it is just the reality of big dog retail operation.

As for whether the CEO has bitcoin holdings, god only knows. He has been very vocal about economic policy since at least 2007ish, so it would not surprise me if he was telling the truth and just loves the idea of a currency not controlled by a central bank. It would be in line with his previous stated opinions.

Anyway, just chiming in here. I have been following Pat Byrne on TV for a while, I have a company that used to be a supplier to Overstock.com, and I have another company that is a middle tier online retailer. I also like bitcoin but have no significant bitcoin holdings. These are obviously my opinions based on my experiences; Overstock could do this stuff for completely different reasons that I don't know. I hope this info is useful."

IndependentBoof,Redskins,1388700195.0,"&gt; the fact that they were so inconsistent and showed moments where they could clearly be effective

Moments, yes. Games? Let's take another look. You provided three examples of the defense's best efforts, so let's first look at these games.

**vs Chargers**
Gave up 341 yds in the air, 69 on the ground, and 17 points (not counting the pick 6). 1 Sack and 2 interceptions.
*Decent game, although they gave up a lot of passing yards, the 2 interceptions were pretty vital to the win.*

**@ Dallas**
165 yards passing, 48 rushing. 31 points. 3 sacks and 1 interception.
*Too many points to give up, but held Dallas to impressively low yardage. Good game defensively overall, I'll give you that one.*

**@ Denver**
339 yards passing, 107 rushing. 38 points (another 7 on pick 6). 1 Fumble recovery, 3 interceptions, 3 sacks.
*I remember this game vividly where the whole team looked on fire in the first half and starting off in the 3rd... and then collapsed. The defense can't be blamed for the offense's 5 turnovers. However, the defense didn't play a complete game either. It's hard to take a game where you give up 38 points as a defensive moral victory*

Overall, I'll concede that you're right that there were a couple games the defense didn't completely suck in. However, I think it also speaks volumes that you have to pick two different games where we gave up over 400 yards on defense alone as examples of the defense being ""effective.""

I'll also point out that while the San Diego offense had a good season, they were averaging 24 points per game before the Redskins (and scored 24 vs us) but picked up late in the season and averaged closer to 29 after the Redskins.

I wonder how much hardware-specific things like this alter the codebase between console and PC versions of video games, and for each console, respectively (for non-exclusive titles)...

So rather than type out something for no reason, I typically just hang around. Maybe enter a contest once in a while, look for someone I could gift something to. (I'm really picky about gift shopping, phew.)

I wouldn't be too surprised if there are a lot of people like me, in that respect. Not necessarily excluded, or feeling bad, but just not able to *squeeeeze* into the mix.

The last thing I want to do is butt into a conversation I have no place being in. I consider it rude, and it likely won't be of purpose. With the conversations in this particular sub, it is a little harder when there isn't as much open-endedness to latch onto and formulate a reply to as there would be in...say...a sub regarding some hobby material like music, or games.

Oh, and the daily thread now I never get in early enough on. I look at it, see like 2000 replies, and nope on out of there. I don't like writing to people that don't bother with reading, it wastes my time- and I'm not a fan of that. =D

This post ended up *way* longer than intended, but hey- you're thinking of ideas, I'm thinking of things, and this may help put the issue together by being objective. So boom.

Random832,news,1388700231.0,"More like ""Why make laws making it so you don't have to prove someone actually murdered someone to convict them, if not to arrest people who haven't committed murder?""

It's an end run around the principle of being innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. They don't like the reasonable doubt standard, so they legislate it away and create a new lower standard of proof. You can't prove they're impaired, so you make a new law making something else [that, remember, **isn't** adequate proof of impairment] illegal so you can get them for that.

People wouldn't be so jaded if they _didn't do shit like this_. 

EDIT: To extend your murder analogy... It would be like if they made it illegal, _per se_, to be standing near a dead person holding a weapon. Sure, it'd be easier to convict people for murder, but it'd also let them more easily execute someone who didn't actually kill anyone."

ANewMachine615,AskScienceFiction,1388700364.0,"&gt; I think I chose the wrong word there. I didn't mean that he literally created them, but he did seduce and corrupt the Maiar spirits into his service. I also like to believe that he had a small hand in how their physical forms turned out due to his Music infiltrating and manipulating theirs.
&gt; 

Perhaps. It's worth noting that early versions of the legendarium had Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs, as Melkor's son. Of course, Sauron was also Tevildo, the evil Lord of Cats, around that time. Yeah.

&gt;Yup, you are right. I just wonder what that entails and to what extent he ""created"" them. Are they, too, corrupted Maiar like the Balrogs? Are they like Orcs in that they are the heavily corrupted form of some other race (like the Eagles)? Are they a creature that Melkor literally created from nothing like other Valar had done with the creatures of the Earth?  
&gt;Due to their full sapience, sentience, immortality, and extreme intelligence I like to believe that they are corrupted Maiar spirits like Balrogs, but we can obviously never have that answer.

I think that they were likely bred bodies, inhabited by Maiar. Glaurung has some weird turns of phrase to describe him in the Silmarillion. Specifically, he can speak ""by the fell spirit that was in him,"" and when he dies, ""the spirit leaves him"" or something like that. It sounds a lot more like a Maiar possession than anything else we see. Still, that's just my pet theory, not anything confirmed. The mechanics of a lot of things (Eagles, Ents, and barrow-wights) are a bit wonky, and not fully defined."

Hatshepsut45,AskReddit,1388700522.0,"While I agree with your conclusion, I think the reasoning you used to reach it is fundamentally flawed. 

&gt;If everyone in the world gets married, there'd still be many women left over

Actually the opposite is true, there are more men than women in the world. The sex ratio at birth is 1.078 men for every woman (global average), women only outnumber men in the 65+ age category with 0.794 men for every woman. [source](http://en.worldstat.info/World)

Here's an interesting list of the [sex ratio in various countries](http://en.worldstat.info/World/List_of_countries_by_Sex_ratio_of_total_population). If you look at the list you'll notice that the countries which average more men than women deviate much more from the norm than those with more women. This is partially because of the practice of aborting female fetuses (160 million girls are 'missing' from Asia because of this). [""China alone stands to have as many unmarried young men—“bare branches”, as they are known—as the entire population of young men in America.""](http://www.economist.com/node/15606229) 

So while you are right about there being an imbalanced gender ratio, it actually goes in the opposite direction than you believe. In most parts of the world women die in quieter ways than men (abortion, child birth, poor women's health, abuse, etc.) that you don't hear about as much as warfare. 

&gt;And rather than them being a widow, they can get married and get some respect/dignity back.

What? Valuing women based on their relationship to a man is something society is just managing to move beyond. Valuing people based on their marital status, aside from being narrow minded, causes fissures in society when large groups of people inevitably don't fit the established mold: [""in Asian societies, where marriage and children are the recognised routes into society, single men are almost like outlaws.""](http://www.economist.com/node/15606229)

VoxMeretricis,AskReddit,1388700580.0,"So, I've dated two guys who lived with their parent(s). My SO lives with his mom right now. He went through a bad break-up that coincided with the loss of his job. He had a savings account he could have relied on, but instead moved back in with his mother to help save money. It turned out to be a good move, since it was more difficult than he expected to find work in his area - had he been living off his savings, they would have been utterly depleted by now. But he's started a new job, he's a hard worker, and we're planning on moving in together this spring when my lease is up. His mom does baby him a little - she does the laundry and cooking, for example - but he contributes to the house bills, is always appreciative and grateful for what she does, and we've already had a long and productive discussion about household expectations when we're living together. It's a little awkward since I never spend the night over there but it's definitely not a dealbreaker. I'd have to literally be insane to pass up such an awesome guy just for living with his mom.

Now, on the other hand, I have an ex who never moved out of his parents' house. He had never been independent, worked sporadically at best, and his parents often paid his bills. His mom didn't just do the laundry and cook - she cleaned his room, bought him his toothpaste and deodorant, changed his sheets, she did everything. He was never grateful, and in fact never seemed to realize someone else was doing something for him. He had no motivation, no ambition, no drive, and frankly - no future. He was actively resistant to moving out of his parents' house and I realized I would be expected to support him if I stayed. Huge, huge dealbreaker and the #1 reason he is my ex. I would have had to be literally insane to stay with him. "

Some leeway is normal, for instance someone with a Biology degree may teach Chemistry (as they have taken the same general courses that more than cover the high school level).  

Additionally, you must pass two sets of standardized tests, known as the MTEL's.  These are by no means easy.  The first is a general test, similar to an SAT.  Reading, writing, 'rithmatic and so on.  The second is a concentrated subject test, similar to an SAT II.


Being a teacher isn't **only** about knowing the subject.  I would argue that being able to relate to students and present information effectively is much more important than being a master of your field.  If knowledge was all that was necessary, a proctor and a textbook would suffice to teach.

Sure,  there are beaches I can go to, and no one is *making* me wear one, but boobs are so over sexualized that I'm not comfortable without them covered up and held down tight. I'm not even comfortable wearing pajamas without a bra if I'm at home with family. And yes, they're feminine and can be sexy, but I wish they were viewed more like... legs. Legs are sexy if you have a shapely pair, but it's accepted  to  show them in shorts in the summer and anywhere with a  casual dress code, and no one's going to blush and stare or hoot (unless you've got shorts running halfway up your honeymaker.) I wish it was like that. I mean, breasts are so linked to sex that some new mothers can't even  breast feed in public - that's basically saying that the sexual purpose trumps the biological reason for them. In movies and television, death and graphic violence can be shown without batting an eye but lord forbid a nipple grace the screen for even a second.     
This strange remnant of a bygone era of irrational modesty is stressful, uncomfortable, and tells women that there is a portion of their body which exists not for them, but only to be viewed by (or hidden from) others. This can be especially harmful for young girls who develop breasts at ten or eleven - they see and are told through media and manners that boobs are for sex and should be hidden, and now suddenly there is a part of their own self which seems to be for sex as well, though mentally they're no where near prepared to see themselves that way. It's stressful, and can be truly damaging if a child is left to learn about their body from society without a conscious effort by an adult to make sure they understand the disparity there - something few parents even want to discuss, because they too are squirming from the sexual connotation. And so women grown up with this self image, the idea of their bodies as something to be used and seen, and condemn themselves to a lifetime of insecurities, without ever knowing the flaw is not within themself but in the society which they exist.  By defining a  part of a woman as a sexual object, her body and self becomes an object as well - breasts don't need to be hidden, and shouldn't be show-stoppers for merely their presence.

Tips I currently use: 

1. Make your protein shakes with Milk. I personally use chocolate milk.

2. Keep peanut butter on deck. Put it in everything. If you have a blender, you can make all kinds of different high-calorie shakes. I usually just eat it by the spoonful. 

3. Olive oil is fantastic for hitting calorie numbers. Shooting it back is weird, but you get used to it. (This is once you get a handle on your Macros and stuff. My advice to you is still to eat as much as possible.)

4. Chicken Breast. This is a gaining commandment.

Edit: If you're more concerned with just putting on pounds versus putting on muscle, (like me) then you can pretty much eat anything. I'm not saying to go out and eat burgers and fries for every meal, but you don't really have to think of it as a diet. Don't get me wrong though. I'm still lifting 3 times a week, and making linear strength gains, but I'm more concerned with overall weight, rather than bodybuilding. Remember what I said. Baby steps. That's how I take it."

But then along came Julius Agustus Caesar, and he was by all rights, a badass. But maybe a little self absorbed too. He decided that there needed to be a way for people to remember him for eternity, so he added the months of August and July to the calendar. But that threw all the mathematical calculations of the previous calendar out of whack, so then they had to adjust the length of each month so that 12 months would be one year. But there was no even way to do that, so they ended up having to give some months 30 days while other months got 31 days, and February got 28 days.

There was still a leap year before this, but it came once every 4 years on the end (or beginning, there's a bit of historical debate about that) of the new year.

So does that mean you can get a DUI overturned - _after_ failing the test - for the lack of probable cause to pull you over?

Has this ever happened?

No, it hasn't. ""They pulled you over because you did something."" is bullshit. But, hey, nothing to hide, nothing to fear, whatever helps you sleep at night thinking it won't happen to _you_.

The whole practice of letting people refuse the test and just get a 12-month suspension (but no jail time) reveals this practice for what it is. No _actual_ impaired driver is going to refuse that deal. They're _GIVING THEM A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD_ in order to intimidate law-abiding citizens into participating in their racket."

&gt;By that logic someone with a bunch of bumper stickers is an artist.

Did they create the bumper stickers with some implied message? If so, then yeah. The artist from the OP is not ""someone running around sticking stickers on random shit"". He had an idea to put a particular sticker on a picture in order to make a specific statement on the idea of body imagery and authenticity in the modeling world. This could evoke particularly strong emotions in some people, ergo it's art.

Hell, even it causing you to feel frustrated about it's validity is only a testament to its artistic nature."

kromagnon,WritingPrompts,1388700990.0,"Eric held the binoculars up to his bloodshot eyes. He had been outside of his childhood home since dusk, waiting for the intruder that killed his father and kidnapped his sister. He still has nightmares about it, although he has aged two decades since that night, this night. 

The sound of the door being torn from it's hinges woke him up from a deep sleep. Still in a daze, he could make out the sounds of glass shattering and a scream. He ran downstairs, clutching his teddy bear, and found the sight that would haunt him forever. Eric's father was laying in the middle of the chaotic living room, barely alive, with his hand pressing tightly on his severely bleeding neck.
""RUN! Get your sister out!"" Eric ran for his sisters room, but when he got there, little three year old Ashley was gone, only crumpled sheets, and a couple bloody handprints on the wall were left. The murderer had taken her out the window, and Ashley was never seen again.

It was time. He was going to get revenge. Eric walked up to the back door of his house. It was locked, but it didn't matter, he had his fathers old key that he kept around his neck. He silently slipped in, closed the door behind him, and hid in the shadows of the kitchen, with this head peeking into the living room toward the front door. He glanced at his watch. ""12:06, Any second now"".

The refrigerator door closed. 

Eric's eyes grew wide. He turned slowly to see his shirtless father, holding a slice of cold pizza, staring directly at him. Tears started to form in his eyes, he hadn't seen his father's face in over twenty years. Before he could say anything, his old man landed a solid punch square in his jaw. Eric stumbled back, suddenly remembering that he didn't look like his eight year old self.  He held up his hands as a show of surrender. ""Dad! It's m..."" His father ran, full speed and planted a shoulder in Eric's stomach, sending him careening into the front door, breaking it. After a few seconds of catching his breath, Eric stood up to see his father had crashed through the glass coffee table, and was struggling to breathe on the floor. He rushed over and looked closer. A shard of glass had punctured the jugular. With some poor judgement, his father had removed the glass and only caused himself to lose blood faster. ""Dad... no."" Eric tried to put pressure on the wound, but was kicked off. His father still didn't recognize him. He suddenly realized what he had to do.

Eric ran around the corner to Ashley's room, as he heard little eight year old Eric coming down the stairs. He flung off her blankets and picked her up. He knew this is how it had to be. This is how it always was. But now he knew what was in store for his sister. She was going to go back to the future with him, and he was going to try his best to be as good of a father as the one they had both lost.

Well, for example, you believe that it's possible -- while drunk -- to determine whether another person is ""clearly black-out level drunk.""  It's not, and that you have not discovered this indicates that, so far, you have been lucky.

Why are you ignoring the rest of my arguments and focusing only on this one small tangent?  If you have no response to the rest of my arguments, then perhaps you should consider why you have no response.  Perhaps you have no response because you know I'm right, and simply don't want to admit it?

For example, at the core of my argument is the suggestion that human beings have been engaging in bacchanalia -- alcohol and music assisted promiscuity rites -- since the dawn of human history, and that it is only very recently that we have began deluding ourselves into believing that the bacchanal has some other (always poorly defined) purpose, and that the inevitable result of participating in such bacchanals while under burdened with such illusions is something we are now calling rape.

You have made absolutely no attempt to even begin to address this point.  Why not?  Does it present a serious danger of changing your view?  Is that why you avoid the argument?"

einTier,AskReddit,1388701297.0,"It's the *evil* that really gets me. 

A quick background.  I'm an atheist, so I don't believe in angels or demons or monsters or ""evil beings"" of any sort.  I'm very scientific and I had read about sleep paralysis long before I ever had an incident. So, my first exposure wasn't the shock it is for most people.  I approached it from a very scientific standpoint and was very rational about what was going on. 

I still wasn't prepared for the overwhelming and overpowering sense of pure, unadulterated *evil*.  

The first time it ever happened, I ""woke up"" in the middle of the night.  It was dark, but not too dark, and I could see around the room. I immediately noticed that I couldn't move.  Curious.  There was also a small black shadow in the upper corner of the room and it started to have form and shape.  As it did, the room grew darker.  I could feel myself being pressed into the bed -- it was the softest, yet firmest touch I can imagine, almost like having 1,000 pounds of feathers pressing down on you.  I wasn't aware of weight so much as I was aware of sinking into the bed.  At some point, I could hear myself snoring, which told me that although I thought I was awake and my eyes were definitely open, I was really still dreaming. 

It was about this time that my mind clicked to what was going on.  I knew this was a sleep paralysis moment.  I was ready.  Sure enough, the shape in the corner of the room turned into a bat-like demon and it descended from the ceiling and sat on my chest.  Freaky.  Freaky enough that I started to wake for real, and as I did, the room got brighter, the demon retreated to the shadows, and everything made a little more sense. 

I've done quite a bit of lucid dreaming, so I attempted to play with this dream.  I could control it, willing myself to fall back asleep and making the demon appear or willing myself awake and making it go away.  I couldn't control much else though, I couldn't make it be another creature and I couldn't make it have wings or sit next to me or even allow myself to do something I'd be able to do in a lucid dream.  Nope, just me stuck there like an idiot while a demon came and sat on my chest.  Over and over again. 

That would have been weird enough, but there was this sense of absolute evil that came with it that I've never experienced in any other way.  I knew the apparition wasn't real.  I knew exactly what was going on -- I was controlling it and allowing it to happen.  Yet, there was no denying that the creature in my room was evil.  Evil in the worst possible way.  As the room got darker, you could *feel* the evil seeping into the room like a fog rolling in.  It was so primal, so pure, so absolute and overwhelming, that it was difficult to maintain composure, even as a rational atheist actor.  In my younger days, it would have been more than enough to get me to forever believe that Satan was real. 

I cannot describe to you the feeling, other than to say that I couldn't continue to experiment because I was so terrified.  Normally, I can get my rational brain to override my lizard brain, but it wasn't happening here.  Whatever it was had tapped into something so primitive and hard wired that I literally couldn't shake it.  I forced myself awake.  Even then, the sense of evil was so pervasive that as a grown man, I had to get up out of bed, turn on all the lights in my apartment and watch television for about an hour before the feeling was distant enough that I could sleep again.   

No one really mentions that part.  They talk about demons and evil and assume everyone knows what they're talking about.  Yes, it's like that.  But yet, it's not.  It's not nearly so rational and it's not nearly so easy to describe.  Even if you think you won't be scared or think you can deal with it, you'll find that to be utterly false.  I wanted the first experience to happen -- I wanted to know.  I've never, ever desired another. 

I can't imagine what it must be like for those that believe in a supernatural world.  "

I'd also really like it if you could claim your costumes from Diango instead of having to hunt this week's location down; if Diango is off limits because he's meant for strictly ""holiday"" rewards only, then maybe add some other static-location NPC you could get them from. The barkers, maybe?

Cosmetic overrides for the rewards have already been suggested, but I'd like to throw my vote in for that too. (though I don't really expect it to be implemented, it would be nice; the random event costumes could use this upgrade as well)

If neither of the previous suggestions are workable, could we at least get slots for the circus costumes in our costume room fancy dress box? It has never made sense to me why we can't drop them in there.

griffer00,Health,1388701458.0,"For someone predisposed to panic attacks, having one during a hangover is not uncommon. Due to the alcohol rebound effect, elevated anxiety is a common side-effect of a heavy night of drinking. If you're already an anxious person, this could be more than enough to push you into a panic attack, especially if you were drinking caffeine or having a stressful day. The problem with panic attacks is that they often trigger long-term anxiety; panic attacks themselves can act like traumatic events. Just keep that in mind here -- your anxiety is probably bad right now because your brain thinks it has just survived a life-threatening event. The sudden increase in anxiety, especially if it's been coupled with sleeplessness, could explain the diminished cognitive ability too. High stress can temporarily ""fry"" your brain and body, and this can come-off as dramatic if the change happens quickly (i.e. within the span of a couple weeks, as you've described here). 

The headaches, though... that's different. You need to hit-up a PCP and/or a neurologist immediately. It might be as simple as a response to elevated blood pressure (due to hangovers and anxiety), but unfortunately, those symptoms are also associated with more serious diagnoses.

In my mind, if something brings you X enjoyment, you should be able to determine if $Y is a good price based on some unwritten ""per unit of enjoyment"" amount you're willing to pay.

For example, an extremely entertaining movie is worth a $12 movie ticket to see in theaters, in my mind, while a less-entertaining movie is not worth $12 to see, but may be worth $5 to rent.

The fact that you can rent the less-entertaining movie for $5 doesn't mean the $12 for the extremely entertaining one is not worth it."

You can also make waffles with this, but that requires a waffle maker. 

The cheapest, easiest way to get protein is eggs. Hard-boil a dozen or so just to have on hand. Have them for snacks or chop them and throw them on a salad or make egg salad. You can also do a scrambled egg sandwich. 

One of my favorites is a take on huevos rancheros:

Fry a tortilla in oil. Fry or scramble an egg. Make/buy some refried beans (you can buy them canned. Or you can buy canned pinto beans. Throw them in a pan with a little onion and garlic and mash them up yourself as they're heating). 

Layer tortilla, beans, fresh spinach, egg, cheese, and salsa. "

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1388701517.0,"While it is an interesting read, the article points out multiple times that the on-going conversation on the subject is complicated with lots of exceptions to the perceived norm.

Like this:

&gt;Whenever you talk about such gender differences in behavior, your are referring to two different Bell Curves, one for men and one for women, that largely overlap. What this means is that any given man might be as good or better as any woman at empathy, and a woman as good as or better than a specific man at handling upsets.

and this:

&gt;(he does not mean that all men have the ""male brain"", nor all women the ""female brain"" of course; many women are skilled at systems thinking, and many men at emotional empathy)

and this:

&gt;She finds when you only look at the stars -- leaders in the top ten percent of business performance -- gender differences in emotional intelligence abilities wash out: The men are as good as the women, the women as good as the men, across the board.

Especially that last quote, it sounds like when given an even playing field with qualified performers, there's no difference between genders when it comes to dealing with emotion. 

The author of the piece mentions the insula region of the brain, and how it is believed to be responsible for the ability to empathize. It doesn't specifically say if there were tests done monitoring male and female brains reacting to various situations. I would be curious to see an experiment carried out that not only was able to measure the insula region of various people's brains, but also take into account the way the individual was raised and their own belief system. For example, a woman who was raised with and believes in traditional gender roles might react a different way to a stressful situation than a woman brought up exposed to feminist/progressive/non-traditional concepts. While the physical brain of the traditional woman might very well react in a way that's noticeably different than men, it could still be due to societal influence if the non-traditional woman's brain does not. I'm not sure if such a study has ever been done.

I don't know if anyone remembers what it was like when OiNK went down, but what.cd was on the tip of everyone's keyboards in every related message board, alongside waffles.  What.cd then leapfrogged waffles by promoting Gazelle. [1]  Then there was that key Perfect 4 freeleech that cemented their position as *the* place for the finest rips.

Now the staff/admin just make weird decisions.

Neutral Leech is a terrible idea.  It incentivizes hit and run behavior.  ""It's free! And you're free from obligation!""

They make everything worse by restricting freeleech to these random waves of Staff Picks.  It encourages downloading a bunch of music that you don't want just so you can get buffer to download the things you **do** want.  When I think of the phrase ""gaming the system"", Staff Picks come to mind.

I do think the staff/admin can't afford the costs of a full-on sitewide freeleech, and that's why it doesn't happen anymore.  There's system maintenance for when you've got 100,000 monkeys hammering and shitting on your tracker AND your website, and there's the money owed to the host/colo for the jump in traffic.  So we get these freeleech picks with the implicit admission that it is necessary for the ecosystem.

Perhaps what.cd is simply too big for the Free-And-Probably-Illegal market.  We've reached a point where perhaps people need to be paid to support Gazelle/Ocelot, and paid to support the costs of simply running.

Noumenology,changemyview,1388701773.0,"&gt; it's not that I believe I have to be a literalist to be a Christian. It's just that I really don't understand some concepts presented in scripture and they make me very uncomfortable.

I totally understand that - there's is a lot to be uncomfortable with. There's a book called ""Drunk With Blood: God's killings in the Bible"" where the author outlines every death God condones - using only numbers in the bible, it's at least 2,821,364 people (with estimates it's more like 25 million). The Pentateuch has lots of gross stuff about interracial marriage (Num. 25) rape (Deut 22, Num 31) slavery (Lev. 25) sexism (Lev. 15 &amp; 27, Deut. 22), homophobia (Deut. 23, Lev. 18 &amp; 20). And that's just the first five books of the OT. People focus on this as a justification for their own attitudes. 

But the bible also says a lot of other things - the greek word ""nephesh"" is used to describe the breath of life, but also refers to the animals several times in genesis before it's used to descibe men excluively. It was only after original sin that people were allowed to eat meat. So were early humans vegetarians? Was the pre-mosaic religion against meat? As another example, Jesus said to ""turn the other cheek."" There are people who take this literally and make a doctrine of extreme pacifism of it (see [Jesus Radicals](http://www.jesusradicals.com/) and /r/radicalchristianity. Then again, there are also people who felt like Jesus was represented as a big pussy for this kinda thing and promote a *different* sorta manly man Jesus (see [Mark Driscol](http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/progressiverevival/2009/01/mark-driscolls-bullying-pulpit.html) or [Bruce Barton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Nobody_Knows).) Who are the original authors and what was their intent? Can we take them for their word? It may not really matter.

My point is, the bible is an ""open text"" - Roland Barthes describes a text as [interwoven with multiple codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_text) that we can unravel and then create new meaning from. People try to turn the bible into a closed text (with one meaning), but once a work leaves the hands of the author, whether that's a scribe, St. Peter or God, it is the reader who has to make sense of what's been written. And they can do that in all sorts of ways - whether by making it into something that justifies their hate and bigotry, or by reaffirming prosocial attitudes about peace, love, protecting nature, whatever. 

Remember, the text is a tool for your relationship with something that transcends the tool - in my view, it interpenetrates it, it is it and it something else. Understanding and having a relationship with that thing, person, entity, g-d, YHWH, Jesus - that is what the whole point of the book is.

EDIT: also, conscerning some of your comments hinting about universalism - I have to admit, I have studied a lot of comparative religion and mythology, and I'm inclined to feel like a universalist in my heart of hearts. Rezi Aslan said something pretty great in his AMA here a few weeks ago - it was that he believes that you can dig six one foot wells or one six foot well to reach god, and that for him, Islam was his six foot well. For me, Christianity is my six foot well, but that does not stop me from drawing groundwater as it rises. 

Read [The Prophet by Khalil Gibran](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/gibran/prophet/prophet.htm#Self-K). I think you'll be inspired. "

ANewMachine615,AskScienceFiction,1388701781.0,"Balrogs are spirits of fire. There are Maiar fire-spirits who did not defect. The Sun, for instance, is a seed of Telperion held by the fire-Maiar Arien. Balrogs take on their form *because* they're spirits of fire, whereas Sauron was originally one of the people of Aule (a Valar who primarily crafted, and dealt with gemstones, and is associated with the earth).

&gt;Why do you think Sauron is more powerful? Durin's Bane killed another Maiar, Gandalf, so it stands to reason a Balrog might be a force to be reckoned with, even to Sauron. From what I understand, Sauron himself was unaware of the fact that Durin's Bane still dwelt below the mountain.

Balrogs are very powerful combatants (though I don't know that killing Gandalf, who managed to kill the Balrog with one metaphysical hand tied behind his back, is the best example of overwhelming power). But Sauron was a leader, something with no Balrog short of perhaps Gothmog could claim. Sauron had cunning and guile -- the Balrogs were more all-destroying creatures. Sauron was just spiritually more powerful than most other Maiar. Ranks like that exist among the Maiar. Osse, for instance, apparently has enough power to credibly threaten Ulmo's rule of the Sea when he attempts to rebel.

Finally, Melkor didn't force anyone to change their looks. It's just a property of evil in Arda that, as time goes on, evil spirits become weaker, and weaker spirits are incapable of hiding their true evil nature. Melkor himself loses the ability to appear fair after he destroys the Two Trees and gives a lot of his power to Ungoliant to get her to help him."

Strictly speaking, the Thu'um imbues **every** sentence with power and potential, but distilling an idea down into a short, concise sentence displays skill and understanding while allowing for rapidity in deployment. Dragon debates/fights would consist of long, articulate sentences, and Nordic Tongues might use just one word, or maybe a scattering of up to ten, to accomplish things, but the ""rule of three"" is an ideal crafted out of a mixture of potency, specificity, and speed that makes for a generalized ""best practice,"" if you will, of weaponized Dovah.

**ZIIL LOS DII DU** is not a standard three-word shout, as it is in fact a full sentence. **YOL TOOR SHUL** roars of the concept of fire, but **ZIIL LOS DII DU** is a **statement**, a **boast**, a declamation of law.

The first king of Norway, Harald Fairhair (changed from originally Harald the Black), the majority of the tapestries we have of him were commissioned by himself.

&gt;True, he had seen pictures in his books of men with great masses of hair upon lip and cheek and chin, but, nevertheless, Tarzan was afraid. Almost daily he whetted his keen knife and scraped and whittled at his young beard to eradicate this degrading emblem of apehood.

Oh, I thought you meant in general, not this moment specifically. 

I think you removed the post because the person I was arguing with is a whiner and can't deal with being challenged, and reported me to derail the argument and have me censored.

I believe you believe your reasoning is sound, but I think you're getting played by a intellectually dishonest ideologue who knows that gaming the ref is a perfectly valid option in a forum like this.

I'm not really interested in arguing the point with you, because arguing with mods is pointless, but I fully expect I'll get banned from these forums eventually.  I'm anti-feminist and cantankerous, and feminists love working the mods to get anyone who disagrees with them banned, and cantankerous people are especially vulnerable to such underhanded tactics.

They'll report me frivolously, interpreting my every comment as an attack on them, no matter how much they have to twit the obvious meaning -- for example, me asserting that I won't argue with someone being willfully obtuse or engaging in obfuscating stupidity gets twisted into an ""attack on their person"" when it's clearly a statement of my own limits for what I'll tolerate.

Eventually you'll tire of warning me, and tire of arguing with me, and you'll ban me just to end their complaints, and they'll win.  It's how they operate.  I've seen it on a hundred different forums."

The truth is that vitamins offer diminishing returns for people whose vitamin levels are ""normal"" (i.e. sufficient for the body's needs). 

Personally, I can't see the harm in taking a multivitamin a couple days per week, especially since I don't always have time to prepare well-balanced meals. Based on my own experience, I start to feel run-down if I go more than a week without taking a multivitamin tablet.

The best part of the Discovery documentary (and IIRC they showed it in this one) is when they show how Shamu may look cute in Seaworld but they are an apex predator. Imagine doing tricks with a Tiger or a Lion. You are asking for trouble eventually.

Pdfxm,worldbuilding,1388702312.0,"Great questions! ill answer as they were given

1 - The change from winter through to summer is like that so it matches up with the rest of the wider world, there the night is natural and flows with the seasons like it does on earth. However on the Ankbar peninsula the night was bent to the will of Nox and at the time his wife Jaliea and there sons and daughters. 

2- The Veils of Dawn are observed in the morning as the sun rises, this is when the sanctuaries though out the city have there service and seven flames are lit on top of the sanctuaries as the Veils peel from the sky. So yes it observable. The reverse happens in the evening as the sky is given back to the Veils until Nox regains control finally. 

3- I have never though about this, however i imagine that Jaliea being the essentially the mother of shadow (implications to do with shadow only existing in light) and her breaking away from her family in pursuit of what she considered 'right' would have implication on how woman were viewed in the society and how autonomous woman are. I have always just assumed in my head that woman and men are entirely equal where rights are concerned in this world, but i could use Jaliea as the trigger for that in humans development. 

4- Thank you very much your questions have triggered more world building :)


Edit : Going back to 3 i have just considered the interplay between the children of Nox and Jaliea, as Jaliea tries to bring them round to her way of thinking, or at least explain her position. "

ANewMachine615,AskScienceFiction,1388702331.0,"Sauron's fair form was destroyed at Numenor. Sauron had been captured by the Numenorean king, seduced him with promises of immortality, and eventually caused the Numenoreans to attempt to overthrow the Valar. In response, Iluvatar drowned the entire island, with Sauron on it. His fair form was destroyed, and from then on he could only take on the form of a Dark Lord.

&gt;Also, chronologically, when does him turning to Melkor's side transpire, in comparison with the other Maiar?

Hard to say. A lot of the side-choosing seems to go on in the depths of time before Arda itself is created. Parts of the Valaquenta and Ainulindale suggest that the Valar labored in space long before they came to rest on Arda, and created the entire cosmos, and that all during this time, Melkor's faction was warring with the other Valar. I would presume, since we see no defections after the foundation of Arda, that Sauron's defection occurred here. But we don't know when any of them turned. Even Osse, who rebelled and was later reconciled with Ulmo, is never given a date for his rebellion.

&gt;And if you don't mind, what did the previous poster intend by referring to him as a Steward?

In the First Age, Sauron was basically Melkor's right-hand man. In fact, in a weird sort of parallel I had never noticed before, Sauron is acting as the Steward of Melkor in the same way that Denethor was the Steward of the centuries-absent King of Gondor."

StopTalkingOK,SubredditDrama,1388702334.0,"Cool, most people in the military know combat is hard but don't really know specifics. About 10% of our forces are in a combat arms MOS, about 75% of them at any given time have been deployed (new guys, shammers). How many of that group have engaged the enemy? Sat on that sniper OP for three days?

One of the biggest problems in an organization as large as the army is homogenization of standards. The physical fitness program has been under an overhaul for the past few years and was supposed to include a new fitness test that better assessed people's ability to perform their job (the test was job specific). Well, it fell through, which is rough because the fitness test is one of the things standing in the way of integrating women into combat roles.

I don't think the issue is being so much dismissed, just... (not that I speak for the big wigs, just my impression) for the Army it is probably on the back-burner for now. The Marines are doing it, a few women recently passed the Infantry Officer course, which is nothing to sneeze at. *But* the Marines are a much smaller force and can react to changes in policy more quickly and with less negative impact than us. 

We have a draw down to worry about: How are we going to select the 70,000 soldiers for involuntary seperation? After they are out how will we restructure the force without sacrificing capability? How will our remaining troops be affected overseas? Close down bases? Sell off equipment? The future for just about anyone in the Army right now is very uncertain. Women will be integrated eventually, it just might take a while for the dust to settle and the details to get worked out."

When it comes to the ability to consent, their rights are rightly mitigated. Thus, the presence of mental illness or the subsequent inducement of such would render any consent to inhumane treatment invalid. Consent *is* contingent and continuous. 

&gt;I guess that goes into the consent part that I've asked us to ignore for the sake of a more in-depth discussion.

No it does not. All consent is contingent. What you have asked to be left out is the non-guarantee of consent. You said nothing of leaving out what said consent is based upon and the moral value of such. In fact, your question would be unanswerable if you did.

&gt;I'm not getting the relevance of this point. Can you expound?

People who are the downtrodden, racial minorities, etc., of society are more likely to be put in situations where they are asked to be experimented upon. This will further stratify society along racial and class lines, which is a bad thing.

&gt;So? What does a scientist's desire for legitimacy have to do with the opportunity of a person to partake in an activity they consent to?

The legitimacy of science is rather important, don't you think? Things which are considered illegitimate are ignored or actively destroyed.

&gt;I don't see why not. A person's free will is not taken from them just because they have started something.

&gt;Data of many experiments is already ""corrupted"" because of ethical concerns. Should we stop science altogether? If not, then why only apply that metric to this case?

Common sense, and real life examples such as torture, tells us that the vast majority who sign up to these experiments will drop out if allowed. This will obviously render any scientific results invalid by skewing and corrupting the data on a statistical and experimental level. Your proposal, even leaving out the multitude of ethical concerns, wouldn't be worthwhile as it would not produce much meaningful scientific results while costing a fortune to operate."

Only approximately 1/50 people failed the test (which says nothing of the people that didn't take the test at all - but we'll ignore them for this purely mathematical argument). That means the 49 people were tested unnecessarily to locate one person who shouldn't (according to the purpose of the law) receive benefits.

So, per person they prevented from receiving benefits, it cost the state as much as $2205 (49*$45).

Surely your average recipient will draw more than that annually, no? And it doesn't appear the tests are annual, just when the people sign up - which I suppose could affect numbers either way, but I'll go ahead and assume that most people draw welfare for an extended period of time.

Borror0,canada,1388702629.0,"It's not that $50 billion disappear from the economy. It's that $50 billions, which could be part of the economy, do not exist because of trade barriers. Barriers cause inefficient organization of economies.

The classic example of the law of comparative advantage is a surgeon who is simultaneously the best surgeon in the world and also types the fastest. The surgeon is faced with the following dilemma: Does he hire a secretary, who will inevitably type slower than he does, so he can perform more surgery each week or should he do everything by himself? Obviously, the solution is to delegate. 

Liberalizing trade is delegating tasks to other jurisdiction, according to each's abilities. If Albertans excel in a particular industry, it makes sense to specialize in that field of expertize and import more goods to in exchange. 

Barriers get in the way of the ability to delegate task to other countries or provinces. Instead of focusing on the areas where we excel, barriers make it artificially more expensive to import goods from the experts. As a result, the province or country is forced to allocate resources to what could be imported for cheaper at the cost of exports in what it could sell at a competitive price. We're forced to do things we're not good at, because of pieces of legislation that says we have to. It's the definition of inefficient."

The Rose Bowl came down to sheer will and coaching. Both teams were executing pretty well, but the huge momentum swings in the game were made by a player stepping up to make a huge play. It wasn't necessarily bad play by either team that let the big moments happen. 

That said, the Fiesta Bowl was fun as hell to watch. You had the feeling that Baylor would break out at any time and that UCF was fighting against the inevitable. Then when UCF got the TD and FG to end the game, it felt like they were finally safe. I was honestly expecting a collapse from UCF and an explosion from Baylor, but they never happened."

I fail to see how this concept is so foreign to people.

Abstract things cannot exist in the physical world.  I'm sorry if you believe otherwise, but I'm sure you can ask any physicist if it's possible for something abstract to possess physical properties.

Words cannot cause physical harm.  Words cannot kill.  Ideas cannot kill.  Thoughts cannot kill...unless you have some psychic abilities.

In your case you cited, it is not the religion that rounds people up.  It's not the words that round people up.  It's the people.  Their physical bodies.  Their tangible selves that do so.

And that's what this whole argument is about.  People don't do terrible things in the name of religion.  People do terrible things period.  They use the concept of religion as a ploy, but it has no power, no force.  And even if they realize that, they will find something else that they can kill in the name of.

Diamonds.  Gold.  Pursuit of the American Dream.

It's all the same pile of shit.  People kill people.  Ideas do not.  If one idea does not exist, people will kill for something else.  Because. People. Kill. People."

Bjorn_Bear,AskMen,1388703012.0,"High School is tough shit man. My times in it were bad too, I never had any bullying to that extreme. I'm sorry that shit happened to you, the dick heads who did that to you deserve a shitty life.

Don't feel obligated to get a girlfriend because everyone else is hooking up. You just haven't found the right woman for you yet and that's fine. You might not find them in High School, it might be later in life. When it does hit, it will be really good, it always is. 

A few people have agreed, and I'm one of them, write High School off. My last year in High School, I literally had no friends like you. I did not talk to anyone. The year before that was similar. I guess I came to a conclusion that, it just wasn't worth it. Most friends from High School, you will never keep in touch with. Everyone goes in different paths and does different things. Don't be hard on yourself because you're not being invited to the Drinking Events, which are really not worth it at all. People can have fun without alcohol, if you're year level is just going out to get drunk, it's boring. 

I don't want to sit here and tell you that you have your whole life ahead of you, I totally get not wanting to hear that. It's so frustrating when anyone tells that to someone. If you can stick out the five to six months, do that. Just keep at it and scrape by. Once your done with those six months, the feeling of being finished with High School, is so satisfying. 

Outside of all of this, think about seeing a Psychiatrist or something. I know that's always frowned upon by a lot of people, but they can really help. Or just start talking to someone more actively about the shit that goes on, it all helps. Everyone always acts like High School is silly drama, but it's one of the most stressful times of your life, specifically with the amount of bullying you're dealing with, that you'll have to scale. If you can scale it, you'll be all the stronger. "

When the Children awake, then the thought of Yavanna will awake also, and it will summon spirits from afar, and they will go among teh *kelvar * and the *olvar* and some will dwell therein, and be held in reverence, and their just anger shall be feared. For a time: while the Firstborn are in their power, and while the Secondborn are oung.' But dost thou not now remember, Kementari, that thy thought sang not always alone?

That also shall come to be by the heed of Iluvatar, and before the Children awake there shall go forth with wings like the wind the Eagles of the Lords of the West.""

So... her ""thought"" will ""summon spirits from afar."" She's not creating them, just summoning them. Apparently the same mechanism is at work for the Eagles. The origin of those spirits is a bit vague, but they clearly pre-exist the Ents and Eagles themselves, being summoned rather than made.

edit: and here it is as posted elsewhere and by macewoahman:


&gt; I have a variation on the tollhouse recipe that should yield a similar cookie. To me they are the perfect crispy caramelized chocolate chip cookie. The has been perfected over the years by mom and then me, it's a secret family recipe. I haven't seen anyone make it the same way, and the are well known enough among my friends that I could be identified by most of them through this recipe. My mom's cookies come out cakier than mine, but I pretty much whip the dough using my kitchen aid.
&gt; 
&gt; This recipe includes the secrets that we usually leave out(read forget) when giving the recipe to others, because I just made them.
&gt; 
&gt; * 2 cups flour (I use All Purpose Flour)
&gt; * 1 tsp baking soda
&gt; * 1 tsp salt
&gt; * 2 sticks butter (regular salted butter)
&gt; * 1/2 cup white sugar
&gt; * 1 cup golden brown sugar
&gt; * 1 tsp (generous) vanilla
&gt; * 1 large egg
&gt; * 1 eggshell of water (from the large egg)
&gt; * 2 (generous) cups chocolate chips (I use tollhouse semisweet chips_
&gt; * 1 cup nuts chopped (optional, makes a drier cakier dough. I usually use walnuts)
&gt; 
&gt; Oven 375F (190C)
&gt; 
&gt; Combine dry ingredients(flour, soda, salt) and set aside. Cream the butter in a mixer, add sugars and vanilla, mixing after each. Add egg and refill the shells will water. Mix until dough is fluffy. Add dry mix to the dough in steps so that you don't create a flour storm in your mixer/kitchen. Once it's all nice and combined it should still be pretty fully. With a spatula stir in chocolate chips (and nuts if used). Portion out on to parchment lined sheets. I use a small scoop. Cook for 9-12 minutes depending upon dough temperature and oven reliability(mine sucks so each was different when I made my double batch for Christmas last night). Enjoy at least one while still warm but not longer squishy because they are amazing.Also, these freeze well so if you bake them to give out you can do it well ahead of time.

[Here's](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2174902/)  a lit review from NIH about facial information processing. Although obviously Asperger's is considered a more mild form of autism, the way that people with Asperger's process information from people's facial expressions is likely to be similar to what is seen in people at other places along the spectrum. Since the ability to process nonverbal cues is impaired in children with autism, they miss these cues and will have to learn on their own how to interpret the expressions and what they mean.

It could be that you feel forced into looking at people's faces, or that it's something you have to ""work"" on, rather than an instinct. On the plus side, it seems to me that a person who analyzes facial expressions more objectively would be more resilient to subtle negative cues. Sometimes I get upset and can't quite place what it was about the person that made me uncomfortable.

my recipe:

&gt;  To me these are the perfect crispy caramelized chocolate chip cookie. The has been perfected over the years by mom and then me, it's a secret family recipe. I haven't seen anyone make it the same way, and the are well known enough among my friends that I could be identified by most of them through this recipe. My mom's cookies come out cakier than mine, but I pretty much whip the dough using my kitchen aid.
&gt; 
&gt; This recipe includes the secrets that we usually leave out(read forget) when giving the recipe to others, because I just made them.
&gt; 
&gt; * 2 cups flour (I use All Purpose Flour)
&gt; * 1 tsp baking soda
&gt; * 1 tsp salt
&gt; * 2 sticks butter (regular salted butter)
&gt; * 1/2 cup white sugar
&gt; * 1 cup golden brown sugar
&gt; * 1 tsp (generous) vanilla
&gt; * 1 large egg
&gt; * 1 eggshell of water (from the large egg)
&gt; * 2 (generous) cups chocolate chips (I use tollhouse semisweet chips_
&gt; * 1 cup nuts chopped (optional, makes a drier cakier dough. I usually use walnuts)
&gt; 
&gt; Oven 375F (190C)
&gt; 
&gt; Combine dry ingredients(flour, soda, salt) and set aside. Cream the butter in a mixer, add sugars and vanilla, mixing after each. Add egg and refill the shells will water. Mix until dough is fluffy. Add dry mix to the dough in steps so that you don't create a flour storm in your mixer/kitchen. Once it's all nice and combined it should still be pretty fully. With a spatula stir in chocolate chips (and nuts if used). Portion out on to parchment lined sheets. I use a small scoop. Cook for 9-12 minutes depending upon dough temperature and oven reliability(mine sucks so each was different when I made my double batch for Christmas last night). Enjoy at least one while still warm but not longer squishy because they are amazing.Also, these freeze well so if you bake them to give out you can do it well ahead of time.

At our recent company party, the management awarded me several recognitions for my efforts, and has on many occasions taken me to the side to express how well they believe I do my job. Additionally, the previous manager has expressed that I am his choice for who should replace him, were the decision his and his alone.

I have only been with the company for 10 months, and my resume is very barren. I have one completed semester at a community college, three years working with database administration, and a year working at a local pizza kitchen of which to speak of.

The biggest thing I feel I can do is to write a good cover letter and have a good interview, as I know I don't have a competing resume. When it comes down to it, based on the resume alone, I know that I will not get the job. However, I feel that despite this I am the best choice for the job, and will do whatever I can (within reason) to prove it to my management.

The pose in #3 in not pretentious in the slightest, but you labelled it as such, which is telling in itself.

Third Thoughts: Overall, suggests a young lady who is more intellectual than her peer group. You're proud of it, but still make the effort to fit in, without going so far as to be a ""girly girl"".

**Edit for some math**

If we ignore the fact that it would take FOREVER to stack, it wouldn't even be the build with the most AP.

The first Seraph's will give 240 AP (60BAP + .03(6000Mana)) but past that you get 60 for each additional Seraphs adding up to another 240 AP.

So you get 480 AP for 5 seraphs plus 320 AP for Rabadon's (120BAP + .3(600)) totaling in at 800 AP.  

Let's take a look at the shield actives though for the hell of it. We'll assume that your character has a full mana bar, with a base value of 1000 mana at level 18. Adding the 5 Seraph's gives you 6000 mana at full. Let's assume you used ALL 5 of your actives in unison, as well.

Active 1 pops, consuming 1200 mana and giving you a 1200 HP shield. we do the same math for the next 4 Seraph's (factoring in that the passive goes off CURRENT mana) and get shields of 960, 768, 614, and 492 HP, respectively. 

Adding these values (remember we used them in unison) gives a whopping 4032 HP shield at the cost of 4032 mana. 

**TL;DR** From this build, you get 800 AP (passively) and a total of 4032 HP shielding from the active. "

It's something I've struggled with a *lot* throughout my entire life, and I'm twenty-five now. ADHD isn't just running around like a crazy person or bouncing like mad with extra energy! It's a disorder of executive functioning. Either you learn to laugh about things, or you go fucking nuts because you've lost your debit card seven times in a single calendar year, or because this is the second time you've inexplicably put your passport atop your car and driven off!

It's not just a discipline thing - if we go on the ""discipline"" principle, I am applying some SERIOUS punishment to myself for forgetting and losing these things so often. It costs a ton of money to get things like this replaced, on top of the stress of just not having them, but none of that is helped with that.

Since I've started medication, though, I haven't had to replace my debit card, I haven't lost my wallet or phone or had to get keys replaced, and I haven't had to buy a half dozen phone chargers. It's little bitty things like that helped by a pill that have improved the quality of my life a hundredfold!

You likely have no actual vested interest in learning about it, but if you do, there are a ton of really great resources in the sidebar over at /r/adhd.

Sure, I doubt it though.  It was reported so fast after I posted, and both times it happened the user complained about my comment in their return comment, that Occam's Razor suggests that the person making the report is the person who the comment was sent to.

&gt;(As another complicating factor, we have AutoModerator set-up to auto-report comments that match certain phrases, so it might have been that, too.)

Unless you just turned the automoderator on in the last few hours, that seems unlikely.  Why would identical arguments in posts from a few days ago not get flagged?

&gt;Now you've made me curious.

Feminists don't like anyone arguing with them.  Probably because so many of their arguments are so facile and completely lacking in even the most rudimentary forms of evidence.  Since they can rarely defend their arguments with facts, they often try to shut down counter-arguments by resorting to a handful of disingenuous tactics.

Gaming the ref/working the moderators is a favorite tactic, as is accusing anyone who argues against them of hating all women, being opposed to equality, or being a rape apologist.  None of which actually address the arguments made, but sure do an amazing job of discouraging people from actually raising those counter-arguments.

&gt; If you think there's a pro-femenist faction at work in CMV...

No, on the internet as a whole.  Look around the internet, and you'll quickly see that feminists and conservatives are neck and neck in a race to see who can get the most pointlessly offended and be the thinnest skinned ninnies on the net.  That's why most feminist and conservative forums have ban lists longer than their user lists."

Everyone is beautiful in their own way.  No one is the ideal of beauty.  Both statements are true.  You can't attain ideals, but you can imagine, fantasize, desire, dream of them.  That's what I'm saying.  People don't sit down in a boardroom and decide on what is the ideal of beauty for this year.  Ideal beauty is the stuff of dreams, of imagination.

From the single dropped knee you can also bring that leg out and put it in front of you, then slowly try to lay down while balancing on your butt until your back touches the line. Getting back to standing from those moves can be tricky as well. As for any butt-balancing, I can't balance with the line straight down the middle, but move my butt to the side and choose a cheek to sit on.

If you're not financially independent, it is time to start going down the pathway towards financial independence...the fast track if possible. You cannot rely on your father or mother from this point on, only control your actions and reactions. 

If you're able to move, do so immediately. Once you're out, write a long letter explaining (specifically) why you felt the need to move and make sure both parents receive a copy. Let them know that you want to form a  healthy relationship that is based on a mutual respect, that you don't believe that simply because they are your parents that they are entitled to respect - but don't let them confuse that with you not being grateful for the positive things that they have done for you. If they want to come around, they will. Don't put yourself in a situation where you're not allowed or given respect. 

If you're unable to leave home, the best thing I can suggest is continuing to meet with a counselor for the remainder of your stay with your parents and possibly after as well, keep your head down, and work hard to get out ASAP.

My father was very emotionally abusive and it wasn't until I was out of the house and realized that I didn't need his ""support"" that I was able to stand up for myself and let him know that I refuse to be treated without respect. We didn't speak for 2 months and he eventually called me to let me know he had royally messed up and wanted a chance to have a normal father/daughter relationship. It has been 4 years and we've never had a better amount of respect and understanding between each other and I now consider my relationship with my Dad to be one of the best.

People can change and there is a reason to hold onto the hope that change is in your future. Don't shortchange yourself and make sure you stay safe."

Renmauzuo,AskMen,1388704268.0,"&gt; You can't discriminate against someone because they're a non-gamer.

It would be discrimination to deny someone a job because of something. It's not discrimination to say ""I'm just not going to feel a strong romantic interest for anyone who doesn't share one of my biggest passions in life."" It's no more discriminatory than saying ""I find a certain hair color attractive.""

Absolutely I have non-gamer friends (mostly coworkers), and I've met gamers I detest, but ultimately all of my closest friends are gamers like myself.

I agree with what you said about interests, if they're just casual interests. If I met someone who didn't share my love of Dan Abnett novels, I'd get over it. If someone didn't quite like the same genres of games I do, whatever. But ""gaming"" in general isn't just an interest. Like, when I go over to a friend's house we play games together. When we stop for dinner, our conversation is probably going to contain games. I have as many Facebook friends from Everquest as I do from college. When my sister moved across the country, one of the ways we stayed connected was playing online games together.

Er, that got more rambly than I intended. Woops.

Make chili using a piece of chuck roast or any other cheap red meat. It's not much more expensive than chicken and it has way more calories from fat.

You can add more stuff for more micronutrients or adjust the recipe to fit your macros. I like to add a can of corn for color and taste.

For Oregon you will have to write a letter to the Sheriff's department of an Oregon county (Linn or Grant are usually OK), along with your application, stating why you want a non-resident permit. Non-resident OR permits are *discretionary* and the fee is non-refundable. Keep the letter simple. Short and to the point. Mine was about three sentences, and my wife's was shorter. If they approve it you will receive a letter with your appointment time for your photo and fingerprints. This can be months. Once you have your appointment you generally get your permit within another four to six weeks.

WA permits are shall issue but you must make an in person application.  State law requires issuance within 90 days.

God_Wills_It_,cowboys,1388704322.0,"Maybe.  But QBs can't beat even the worst DB's if they aren't given the time to.  The 2007 Giants were able to beat Brady and his record setting offense with Gibril Wilson (5th round) &amp; Michael Johnson (7th round) as safetys.  They were able to do that because of their star DL blowing up the Pats OL and not giving Brady the time to pick apart the secondary.

I don't consider Wilcox &amp; Johnson late round draft picks.  At least not under my own random arbitrary cutoffs.  (1st, 2nd - early  3-5 - mid 6-7 - late).  The team philosophy is more invest their early picks in the lines and try to fill in the skill positions/backups cheaper in the mid rounds.  You can't have 1st round picks at every position and safety is one it seems they have decided to go cheaper.  

That might be a mistake but it has worked for other teams.  And it's not as if drafting a safety in the late 1st or early 2nd means he automatically comes in and does better than our 3rd/4th rounders.  This past draft the Jags took John Cyprien 33rd.  Halfway through the year PFF graded him at -19.4 and had this to say ""On the bright side he’s played every snap for the team. On the downside, he’s looked woefully out of his depth, with the game just too quick for him right now. He’s our lowest-graded safety and the team has evidently taken the approach he’ll be better for the lumps he takes this year.""  A bit later D.J. Swearinger was taken by the Texans at 57 and he graded out better but still only to -3.9.

The ravens took Matt Elam in the 1st at 32. Week 8 he was graded at -2.5.  He got worse over the 2nd half and his final grade was -3.6.

Safety is one of the harder positions to transition to.  (Especially as they and CBs are the most affected by the constant rule changes.  They have it harder than anyone).  Even some top picks come in and struggle to adjust.  Tho less so with players like Vaccaro or Reid who did grade out positively their first season.  

I'm not arguing with you that we could use upgraded talent at Safety.  We could for sure.  I just don't see it being drafted very high this year.  Not with the other talent available in the draft, and what we have committed to the position now.   "

Don't worry about getting perfect CS. We aren't pros and aren't trying to be. We are just here to have fun and play a video game. If you want a goal to shoot for, focus on keeping yourself ahead of your opponent. Give him 15 cs for every kill he has and focus on keeping your number higher. Be it by denying him cs, landing last hits, stealing his jungle, ganking for kill gold, or any combination of those. Just focus on making sure you are ahead of him, and you will improve. Also, eat a snickers.

(1 kill actually equates into 17-18 cs I believe, but I use 15 as an easy number to add with in my head. It gets the point across.)"

But I forgot things - lots and lots of things. Forgot things that *normal people aren't able to forget*. Came into work on federal holidays when I work for a university and have known for years that we're closed on these days! Lived in a constant state of stress because I had to replace my wallet and debit card every few months because I would leave it on a car, or on a vending machine, or in an ATM, or what have you.

This is the very, very, very simplified, watered-down version of what I was fighting with, but when I confessed to my boss that I thought I might be struggling with ADHD, since a physician had recommended that I might possibly have that when I was in high school, I was one of the lucky few adults who was met with support and encouragement. His son is special needs, and HIS supervisor has a daughter with ADHD. We met with the equal opportunities office on campus, and then met with a representative from the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation, where I was given an extensive battery of tests by a psychologist that confirmed it.

And now life is getting better. Work is better. I'm going back to finish the very few classes I have left for my undergrad degree. The sad truth that I saw a lot of first-hand from so many meetings at the department of voc rehab is that a lot of adults DO suffer from this, but the poor executive functioning means they end up losing their jobs, or wandering from job to job and struggling to keep a consistent one. ADHD also has a high comorbidity with things like depression and OCD, and as stress rises, those might manifest.

I encourage you to take a look at /r/ADHD if you want learn more about the biological side of it. :) There are TONS of good resources there."

Yes, my car sounded like a Harley. You know a really, really loud gang of bikers. It was sooo loud. Plus, it was falling apart. The steering wheel moved, only one speaker worked (the driver's side in the back), the radio only worked if you held in the power button, and there were several holes in the floor board (you could see the pavement as you drove haha). And on top of that, the car could barely go over 60 MPH without shaking really bad. However, it was my first car and I loved it dearly. Good times in that car! :')

He kind of looked like that picture. He was a beautiful bird. I had him when I was about 7 years old. He would whistle my name in the mornings when my parents would call me to get up for school. He also used to walk up your arm and would peck - I said ""kiss"" when I was little - your neck. I loved that little guy. I've not had a bird since him. 

OH and I forgot. I did also name a turtle. I had a baby [red-eared slider](http://i.imgur.com/EWAjdzf.jpg) named Donatello. I had him when I was 11 or 12. I had to give him away after a few months because I moved. He's probably grown well into his size and kicking it with the other ninja turtles :P

I also no longer have my dog Roxie. She was a beagle and full of energy. I moved back in with my father and couldn't take her with me. She now lives on a farm in Texas with several other beagles running to her hearts content. 

I have my cat, Kumo, still. He's going on 5 years old. I adopted him (as well as I had with Roxie) from the ASPCA in Cincinnati. [This](http://i.imgur.com/a3dJ9od.jpg) is Kumo and Peach.

VooDooBarBarian,Calgary,1388704384.0,"ah, sorry I replied straight out of my inbox, didn't see the response from /u/lectio 

If I'm reading you right, you're asking about using it in the ""Mama was a gypsy, daddy was a rolling stone"" context? In that sense, you're correct, there is no negative connotation associated with having no fixed address. However, let's take a broader look at some other words words that can be used to describe that sort of lifestyle:

Nomad - this is the term I'd use. It is completely generic as it is a description of the lifestyle itself with no ties to any specific ethnicity. An example of what I'm talking about would be how we now refer to the Plains Cree as ""nomadic"" rather than ""migratory"" because the latter has non-human connotations.

Gypsy - as you say, a free wheeler with possibly a more romantic connotation

Vagrant - some unsavoury character, might be a reason they don't have an address 

so your use of gypsy is closer to ""nomad"", with no negative and possibly even a slightly positive connotation... but here's the problem... if you found out someone was a gypsy, would you assume they were also a nomad? Or, an example from closer to home, I'm Canadian, born right here in Calgary, but I don't really like hockey. Since other people I meet assume that I love hockey, part of my identity as a Canadian has been co-opted by someone else's view of what it means to be Canadian.

To further muddy and compound the issue, in many places in Europe, gypsy = vagrant = criminal and that tainted view colours other peoples' impressions of an entire ethnic group. For proof of that you need look no farther than Sun News host Ezra Levant:

&gt; “Gypsies are not a race. They’re a shiftless group of hobos. They rob people blind. Their chief economy is theft and begging. For centuries these roving highway gangs have mocked the law and robbed their way across Europe.”

Saying ""well that's not how I meant it"" only goes so far. Ergo, I advocate calling Roma Roma and nomads nomads."

That may be the case, but this isn't a scientific study - or really a study at all - and it doesn't tell us anything of the sort.

The *only* thing it tells us is the failure rate of the people that volunteered to be tested; people with all the time they need to prepare (if necessary), and people with not only a vested interest to pass the test, but also with a vested interest *not to fail*. Given all that, it's fairly impressive that there's 2.5% of those people that *still failed*.

But that's okay, we don't need to bring logic or reason into the mix. It's funny, you mock the notion that people would game the system and then go on to suggest that the people tested certainly make up a representative sample / are the entire sample of the welfare-seeking demographic in Florida."

While it is unclear exactly how things would be, I would offer this: we are starting to see the rise of flat rate non-emergency medical services, and the growth seems to be based on the price. Furthermore, while the procedures are not emergency (ie: no one has $800 save you from trauma services), there are flat rate non-trivial services like knee replacement and so on. Given time to shop for price, and if there was transparent outcome data (or even patient reviews), this does seem to indicate that people would be interested in choosing healthcare this way. Keep in mind, even stints and bypasses are usually scheduled days or weeks in advance, which is enough time for families to shop and choose (if shopping for them really was a thing)."

Catalyxt,teenagers,1388704730.0,"When a similar thing happened to me, my best friend gave me a few tips to get through it:

1) It will hurt, but it will also stop hurting eventually. There's no way of telling how long it will hurt for, but you've got to remember this is temporary.

2) Don't let yourself hate her. Even though she acted like a bitch (my mate's words to me, but it sounds applicable here as well) you've got to forgive her, because otherwise you come across as petty and desperate.

3) In the short term, find a way to distract yourself. Reddit is okay for this, but not as good as getting some of your mates and doing something fun. Not like watching a film or something sedentary. It'll be hard to drag yourself up but if you get outside and do something active you'll feel a heck of a lot better.

4) Pancakes.

5) Be very careful of the type of music you listen to. Nothing depressive or slow. It can be chill, but personally I'd recommend like [The Soulchild Remix of 19-2000](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondpLxoRJuk)

6) If you have tumblr, don't go on it for at least a week. I don't care how much your followers depend on you, don't do it.

You'll be alright."

The message arrives in the form of a [Scroll of mail](http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Scroll_of_mail) delivered by a mail daemon (ha) who shows up, delivers the message, and ambles off.

It's simple, but it's such an embedded experience that it creates a sense of community, or even *culture*, in what is otherwise a [bunch of ASCII characters](http://nethackwiki.com/mediawiki/images/3/3a/Nh343-vt-normal.png).

Not only would that help you not make the mistake of transferring your problem with you, but it could allow your mom/family to be a part of the decision process (or at least feel they are) - and that could make them feel better. I agree about framing this as more of a positive thing - talk about how you want to go to a different school to get a different experience that will allow you to grow more as a person, and you think you'd like to move in with your dad because change is good. Or whatever makes sense to you.

And remember, no matter what, communication is important - and as long as you maintain communication with your mom and grandparents (which I'm sure you would) then you can always make arrangements to visit and come home in case of emergency.

Probably not, though.

&gt;What if a very small group of scientists succeed in engineering a novel flu virus unlike we have seen before.

So, we're already positing something that both admit is an unlikely scenario. Got it.

&gt;Would it be possible for the states entities to prepare for it, by cloaking their preparations by labeling it as normal preparations?

Yes.

&gt;By ordering the ranks of FEMA to incrementally increase (maybe over the course of a decade) their stockpiles, would they be able to stay beneath the radar?

Maybe? In the deficit-hawk world where every congressperson is looking to say ""See? I cut this"" to their spending-averse public, probably not, though.

The bigger question is why they would do this, and who would order it, *and* who would have the institutional consistency to stick with the plan for, as you posit, a decade. I mean, it's not political appointees (as they get cycled relatively frequently) and it's not the lower-level functionaries (as, seriously, where would they get this plan from,  and why would they implement it, and how without oversight and approval from higher-ups?).

slangwitch,sex,1388705007.0,"Yeah, as a female I was surprised at how difficult giving a blowjob could be when I first started. No one really brings up how uncomfortable it can be or gives you pointers on how to limit that discomfort. You kind of just see girls going crazy in porn with the thing all the way in there. But that part can be hard too thanks to the gag reflex! I think anyone who hasn't actually given someone a blowjob to completion just can't understand that. It really isn't like anything else you ever do with your mouth and a person has to have a lot of control over their discomfort factor and gag reflex to do anything close to what's in porn. 

I find it pretty erotic and fun but I would prefer that it generally be a complement to other activities and not the sole focus of sex as it is a turn on for me and if he comes from it without any attention paid to me then I will feel sexually frustrated for a while as he will lose his interest in sex at that point. Maybe that's where she's coming from? Sometimes it is nice to just get your partner off without worrying about yourself, but everyone has different tolerance levels for their own sexual frustration (and also shouldn't get bullied into anything that is painful for them). 

I also don't know that I believe that giving a woman a blowjob can really compare, even if she comes from it. Making a mental tally of sex acts, as if that means anything in terms of what you are owed, is just asking for disappointment and relationship problems."

rottenborough,psychology,1388705067.0,"Evolutionary psychology may be equally falsifiable in its predictions, but it doesn't mean they are no more guesswork than mechanical theories in psychology, *especially* when the mechanical theories have not even been developed.

Evolutionary biology works because we already have a pretty good grasp of the mechanical theories of biology, and evolution further inquires how the mechanisms came about based on fossil evidence.

Evolutionary psychology on the other hand, often starts from behavioural observations in a few specific cultural and economic settings, skips over mechanical explanations, and proceeds to prehistory with extremely limited evidence from fossil records.

In the sense that theories are useful because they summarize and predict empirical observations with an internally coherent system, evolutionary psychology is fine. In that sense that theories are a set of logically followed statements, each supported by and verifiable based on empirical observations, evolutionary psychology is flimsy at best."

JJEagleHawk,AskReddit,1388705123.0,"Perhaps it is regional. (I didn't travel through enough of England to find out).

But, 1 in 5 englishpersons live in London . . . and I know very well that people stereotype Americans on worse ratios. Brits sometimes asked me to do a British accent for fun (I can't), but in retort I'd ask them to do an American one. Invariably it was Hillbilly Texas, NYC, or Cali-Girl. (also very bad impersonations). New York City, Lubbock Texas, and California COMBINED aren't 1/5th of the American population. I certainly don't talk like that. 

TL/DR You're right, England has differing regions but it's hard to sum up ANY country universally, and while one city doesn't a country make, London is the only place in England most outsiders will ever visit, much as most English people that visit the U.S. will visit NYC or Miami, not OKC or Des Moines."

HalfysReddit,AskMen,1388705314.0,"Here's an example of poor timing:

I met a girl while I was in high school. We are both highly intelligent people who were very mature for our age. However, we were still high schoolers, and therefore naive as fuck.

Long story short, I broke it off a few months after I graduated. I was entirely happy in the relationship, but I had convinced myself that I was being naive and was going to miss out because of how devoted I was to my first girlfriend.

So I went out into the world single. I am a very eligible bachelor - I hate to sound arrogant but I have put considerable time and resources into self-improvement, and it has resulted in many women finding me attractive. So now I've got options. Sweet, right?

Except all I care about is that girl. We discussed it at one point in time and came to the conclusion that had we met just a little later in life, we probably would have gotten married and died together. Unfortunately though she's engaged to another guy and I'm too little too late.

Just one example of how timing can ruin an otherwise great relationship."

Usually you shouldn't need much more because you don't want to fight the enemy duo anymore. Bot lane is extremely snowball~y, once the enemy got his B.F. and you don't you'll not be able to win the lane back without your jungler unless the enemy gets overconfident and misplays. From now one you should sit back and farm as much as you can.

As far as ""*real*"" defense items go, usually you build one when it'll prevent you from dying in a team fight. During lane phase you don't need one at all because it's mostly about farming. You only need sustain (Doran's Blade, Vamp. Scepter) The ""usual"" build path indicates a defensive item as 5th or 6th, but it might be a good idea to pick up an early negatron cloak/chain vest etc. If you opt for an early full defensive item it'll delay your damage for too long most of the time, giving the enemy a huge advantage. If you haven't build your Last Whisper yet that Guardian's Angel won't win you the fight because the enemy AD will just rip through your tanks while theirs being a massive wall without the LW."

That's weird. I thought it was because England was incredibly powerful and colonized large amounts of the world and forced their language onto many people. Then, some of those places, like Canada, the US, and Australia went on to become incredibly large and powerful countries of their own. The US became a leader in media and started producing music and television which was exported into almost every country.

To Christians:

Wicca: Satanists. Even though Wicca is way older than Satanism.

Pagans: Satanists. See above comment.

LaVeyan Satanists. Satanists, even though they don't believe in Satan, outside of him being allegorical.

Thelemaic orders: Satanists, even though they don't believe in Satan but worship their own sets of gods.

I really can't see why, after four or five seasons of Superman not doing it alone, it would be remotely neccessary to give Batman the moment that *Superman: TAS* had spent years building up to."

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1388705579.0,"I make a point to follow feminist blogs on tumblr, because I like to keep my finger on the pulse of the discussion. There are *loads* of posts on tumblr decrying to stereotype of the ""tumblr feminist"". The majority of users on tumblr, even those who identify as feminist, shun the ""tumblr feminists"", from what I've seen. The most misinformed and loud are all also very, very young, I'm talking 13-18. Most of the users on the site don't take them seriously. 

Something else to keep in mind about tumblr. When a post has lots of notes, it's not like upvotes on Reddit or likes on Facebook. Notes on tumblr are a total of reblogs, and lots of users will reblog things they strongly disagree with so they can comment on it. So just because an ignorant tumblr post that claims to be feminist has lots of notes, many times those notes are people pointing and laughing and calling it out as bullshit.

I've also seen the two images in myfriendscantknow's comment above posts many times on what I would deem ""real"" feminist blogs, meaning that when you skim through the notes, the feedback is mostly positive as opposed to pointing and laughing.

I'm curious if you have a link to the loudest voices of feminism that you're referring to. "

I'm not trying to imply that you have to marry her but you need to can't have the mindset that relationships should just be casual and all about pleasure.

DoxasticPoo,TheRedPill,1388705844.0,"No offense but your question walks the fine line of manipulation.  It's not your choice whether or not he will be alpha.  So ""helping your man feel more masculine"" seems to fall very close to training him into being an alpha.

He does that.  Not you.

However, you can let his alpha-ness come out.  That means sitting back, letting go of control and letting him take the lead.  Recognize in yourself that in order for him to be dominant, you have to be submissive.  The only dominance that exists is dominance that is given.  

So give it to him.  Give him the right to dominant.  And let him know that you appreciate it.  That you appreciate him taking care of you in that way.

And maybe your question is a bit manipulative...  I've been thinking about how all woman are manipulative but that maybe it's not necessarily a bad thing.  Maybe there's good manipulation and bad manipulation.

Bad manipulation is ""getting him to..."", or ""making him feel.... so that he'll.... "", where the desired outcome only benefits the woman.  Or even if she thinks it'll benefit him, ""benefit"" is defined in her terms.

Good manipulation is ""getting him to..."", or ""making him feel.... so that he'll...."", where the desired outcome benefits both of you.  And basically, this becomes motivation.  You ""light the fire under his ass"", so to speak.

If all woman are manipulative, you know how to do this.  Just make sure whatever you're doing it benefiting both of you, where ""benefit"" is defined together.  Just make sure whatever you're doing brings out the alpha in him in a way he wants.

Personally, a compliment about the size of my arms would make me think, ""Why did she just say that...?""  But if she came over to lay on my chest after I told her I wanted to finish a book, I would take that as acceptance of my dominance.  I call it, ""walking in my garden.""  If she wants to walk in my garden, awesome.  If not, I'll find someone who will or enjoy its beauty alone."

A lot of people cite the ""be fruitful and multiply"" passages, saying that it means we should all have kids. But if you look at the context, that line was said a couple times to *specific people* at a *specific time*. I don't think it has anything to do with us right now, especially with how much we have already filled the earth. Some people also think using birth control is wrong because it's ""unnatural"" and supposedly changes God's plan or something like that. But I think God gave us free will and the ability to think critically and develop the resources we have today. 

I believe that it is my calling to help others and to impact people in a positive way. I feel that I am fulfilling my purpose by being a teacher and helping to raise the next generation. I volunteer with kids at my church and with charitable organizations. I've spent time volunteering with orphans both abroad and in my community.

If I had my own kids, it would limit the amount of time, energy, and money I would have to contribute to society. I like to think that God is happy with me for using my gifts to help others in His name. I might adopt or foster one day. I can't imagine having biological children when there are so many already in the world who need homes. 

I have spent a lot of time evaluating my faith and my beliefs on different topics. My parents are very conservative fundamentalist types, and they pretty much agree with the (US) Republican Party on everything. I have many beliefs that differ greatly from theirs and many of the ""traditional"" views of the church.

Le_Pyro,ModernMagic,1388705968.0,"Thank you! You listed quite a few, so I'll go through them one by one:

* Spell Snare - I really hate having dead cards in my hand. Like *really* hate it. Modern is one of those formats where pretty much every card you draw has to matter or you just lose, simply because the power level is roughly similar across cards (compared to Legacy or Vintage, where you can make up for it by having access to cards such as Force or bigger more 'haymaker'-y cards such as SFM/Jace and compared to Standard where it's okay to let something sit on the board for a few turns. While Snare does hit a lot, there are times where it'll just rot in your hand. 

* Sphinx's Revelation - This isn't a Revelation deck, in order to really make it work you need something like Think Twice in order to consistently hit all your land drops while keeping parity with your opponent. A lot of the time you won't be able to Revelate for more than 3 or 4, which isn't the gamebreaking amount normally hit by control decks. I've beaten opposing decks which have Revelated for 4. It's really bad early game as well.

* Think Twice - See above for the most part. Think twice belongs with revelation, and while it's an okay card on its own I'm not sure what I could/would cut for it.

* Geist - I talked about Geist a little in my comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1u7fus/modern_gpt_for_gp_richmond_1st/cefq4w3). 

* Stony Silence - While it does make affinity into a bunch of vanilla artifact creatures, it's also really narrow. Sure, you could bring it in against GR Tron but that doesn't really deal with their relevant spells, and against Pod your goal is to target their creatures, not their pods because there's no guarantee that they'll draw their pods while they're almost guaranteed to draw creatures.

* Ajani - I thought about playing him, but ultimately I don't think he fit well with my game plan. He comes down at an awkward time (when I'm holding up Snaps + something or Resto) and is a little too slow for my taste. Plus he's a little vulnerable if I'm behind and looking to creep back into the game. 

*** 

I did not in this particular deck, although I have played with Relic in a couple other sideboards and I never liked it quite as much as RiP. While it is cheaper and cantrips, the passive global effect is better for me as a good player will simply play around Relic. Especially against Jund where all it takes is a few cards before their Goyf is big enough to cause problems. I recommend not siding out too many Snapcasters because the deck isn't particularly threat dense and there's no guarantee that you'll ever see a RiP. I never had a problem in that regard though.

***

I never gave Fulminator a shot, but I believe that Molten is  the for the reasons you outlined, the 2 damage is guaranteed rather than requires an attack, it can hit directly planeswalkers if you need it and flashing it back on turn five is devastating against the decks it comes in against. 

3 Counterflux was definitely the right number in my opinion. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1u7fus/modern_gpt_for_gp_richmond_1st/cefezpu) are my thoughts on Remand. In my opinion trying to play Cryptic and Kiki in the same deck (especially without any filterlands) is just asking for mana problems, and while the card is absolutely bonkers amazing it's not worth it right now. 

***

25 was definitely the right number as you really want to hit four lands, which is just a tad less likely with 24 and not a ton of draw spells/think twices. Thank you for your questions, hopefully I was able to answer them sufficiently and let me know if you have any more!"

Masturbating does have it's benefits, however, if one is trying to quit porn, this almost always goes hand-in-hand with it so we tend to cut both. However, unlike sleep, cutting masturbation won't hurt you because your body simply disposes of it's excess sperm anyways. Plus, testosterone levels don't change at all during periods of abstinence^1.

I own Trajan, and I like it. I've played Castles Of Burgundy, but I didn't like it - so I traded it. I've inspected games like Bora Bora, Rialto, or Bruges - and in my eyes I just see a lot of player boards with little chits, where players are essentially all playing their own mini-numbers games and counting up VPs afterwards. Not really my bag. 

I think his games appeal not to a different *level* of gamer, but to a different *subset* of gamer. The programmers, the logical thinkers, the mathy people, and people who like working in Excel. Some games will cross-pollinate, but most of his stuff has failed to impress me in the way a heavy euro like Archipelago would. Still a very systematic game, but tied much more closely to a theme I can wrap my head around.

Drop_,science,1388706134.0,"No.  That's not how conflicts of interest work.  It always surprises me that people have no fucking idea what a conflict of interest actually means on /r/science.  

A conflict of interest doesn't inherently mean that the data is bad, but just because the data is sound doesn't mean that there is not a conflict of interest.  

Perhaps impartiality is the wrong word.  Accuracy or veracity would be more apt.  But even if the data were ""accurate"" given the data set, there are still many, many ways for data to be manipulated before publication.  The idea that the data in the paper and/or the methodologies are good doesn't mean that it's good science.  

It's very easy to leave data out or to change the focus from the primary outcome to a secondary outcome. 

&gt;Of course, the conflict demands a closer inspection of the data.

This is virtually impossible without access to the full protocol and raw data.  

I still find it astounding that people don't understand what a conflict of interest is on /r/science of all places.

If you're in a situation where you have to pull a firearm it's likely one of the scariest moments of your life.  Combine that terror with trying to move fast and it doesn't really add up to pinpoint accuracy where you can do something like an intentional limb shot.  As a police officer I'm trained to shoot at the center mass of the target because it's the highest probability of striking the target with the minimal risk of bystander injuries (from misses or over penetration).  Carrying a firearm as a police officer and a civilian are two different things though, for a civilian it should be the last line of defense, basically ""I had no other options, I thought I was going to die so I took my last resort, pulled out my firearm and shot"".  Shooting at a limb would give the impression that you had extra time to line up a more precise shot on a smaller target so perhaps there were other options available to you.

TL;DR: Shoot for the largest part of the body for greatest probability of accuracy and least probability of striking unintended targets."

He came to as many appointments as he could.  He stayed with me in the ER the times I had to go and offered support even though he was just as scared as I was.

Basically feminism is the belief that men and women should be treated as equals and that masculine and feminine qualities should be as well;  masculinity and femininity can be found in most everyone.  As for the theory of the patriarchy-feminists believe that we all contribute to it and that it hurts both men and women.

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1388706443.0,"&gt; Well, on the one hand, I am trying to make up for 10 years where a lot of people did favors for me and bought me drinks. I partially look at it as ""paying it forward."" I slept on a lot of couches, so now my couch is open for others to sleep on.

I've sat on both sides of the fence. 

Among my peers/ex-classmates, I'm among the top, like /u/tehwankingwalruses is among his own social group. I make several times more than many of them, and some of them are getting married or have other financial concerns, so I try to pick up the tab for them when we go out.

Among many of the friends I made through professional connections, on the other hand, I'm completely outclassed, and don't even want to touch the multi-thousand dollar food bills. 

What I try to remember is that it's mostly a matter of practicality. 

From a technical perspective, paying back favours isn't *that* important. Friends do these favours for each other as a gift, and interestingly enough the [cognitive dissonance](http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance_theory#Festinger_and_Carlsmith_1957) will often make the giver like the receiver of the favour even more.

It's a subconscious rationalization. *""Why am I doing this favour for him? Oh, right, it's because I like him.""*

So if you just want to repay favours to make people like you, it might be less important than you think.

(Note: This only applies if we're talking about ""gift"" favours, not explicit debts.)

Frankly, I don't think gifts should be obligatory. To me, supererogatory gifts are the best. I don't want to burden people I care about whenever I give them a gift, big or small. 

Similarly, I project these same thoughts on to the multimillionaires paying for the bill. They picked up the bill because it barely hurts them and it made them feel better to serve us.

I give them sincere thanks, say what great pals they are, and that's the end of that. 

&gt; I guess in subtle ways I used to ""hint"" that I needed financial aid from friends (or at least hint to them not to suggest we go to expensive places). Now I'm trying to ""hint"" to them that I don't need help.

&gt; But I might be sending mixed messages.

If they are still trying to help you, then just let them know explicitly that you're grateful for their help, but you're more financially secure now (if you actually are). It's cheaper than trying to prove it by spending recklessly.

As an aside, I suggest you also look into r/personalfinance and/or r/frugal for other suggestions to balance and stabilize your budget, since you believe that your budget is currently the root of your confidence."

Everyone agrees that beating children is wrong. However a lot of people still think it's entirely acceptable to punish your children with violence as long as that violence is mild. Say, a slap on the butt or the back of the hand.

It's one of the few things that I am very adamant about as being poor parenting. My intuition tells me it's wrong, all empirical evidence suggests that it is wrong, and the only justification anyone has been able to offer for it is that other people do it too. I simply cannot imagine a single life lesson that requires you to be violent with your child in order to get your message across. However, there are unintended lessons that are taught with such behavior - such as might makes right and it's entirely acceptable to shape the behavior of others with pain or threats of pain."

CaspianX2,politics,1388706576.0,"Except the ""fertilizer"" in question isn't the labor, it is the measures taken to increase labor. And at some point those measures *do* begin to have diminished effect, as even with the easing of financial limitations, there are only so many people who will be *qualified* to become medical professionals. You can't just throw money at a normal person to turn them into a doctor.

Given that being a medical professional is *already* a lucrative career path, as long as you make it an accessible career path, it should attract plenty of people. However, there is inevitably a point where making it more financially accessible starts to have decreased effect, as other barriers (such as the difficulty and dedication required) become greater obstacles than the expense.

Have we reached that point yet? How far from it are we? Exactly what *is* that point? These are all difficult questions, to be sure, and I don't claim to have the answers, but you don't even seem *interested* in knowing what those answers are. You have already made your determination despite having almost *none* if the information necessary to do so.

All you have is the amount of money, but you have absolutely *no* information on how effective that money's use will be, at what point that effectiveness dwindles, what the ideal spending level is, how much change spending on *any* level will produce, and how that change stacks up against the still-nebulous additional demand created by the ACA.

Yet, despite this lack of *necessary* information, you have reached a conclusion by forcing numbers unrelated to the issue at hand into your argument, apparently to support what in your mind is a foregone conclusion.

And to be clear, I'm not saying you're wrong, but I *am* saying that you have no way of knowing if you're wrong or right. And in absense of that information, at the very least we can say that this spending takes things in the right direction, even if we can't say how far. However, assuming that it isn't enough is jumping to conclusions.

Let me add another number into this whole thing: 30 billion. That's a rough estimate of the yearly budget for federal educational grants for *all* educational paths, not just medical fields. Let's say that's an even $100 billion over 3 years. This bill adds an extra 2% over that dedicated solely to medical professions. However, possibly more importantly, and a point you've chosen to ignore so far, it makes getting loans. Hell of a lot easier for medical students, giving them much ?ore ability to enroll in classes at far less long-term cost to us taxpayers.

How much of that 30 million is devoted to medical students currently? How much of a difference will that 2% make? These are additional important questions that should be answered before coming to any conclusions, but this does at least illustrate that this isn't nearly as small an increase as you seem to think, since the closest thing we have to a comparable figure is nowhere *near* as big in comparison as the numbers you point to.

But undoubtedly all you'll see is ""2%"" and conclude ""2% is tiny"" without asking ""2% of *what*?"" or ""how much of a difference would that 2% make?"". But then, I suppose questions and uncertainties are better left for those without fundamentalist views.

One of the most important things about marriage is accepting each other through THICK and THIN!  Complete acceptance (barring abuse/drug and alcoholism etc) is part of what a good marriage should be.  Who wants to be scrutinized by their partner who they are supposed to trust unconditionally?

It seems as though only yesterday I was filled with songs of happiness, bright and cheery tones, and seasons of never-ending song. I was complete, fulfilled, and happier than I have ever been. Springtime was always my favorite, the fresh crisp air inspired serenade after serenade. I remember, vividly, how the colors of the blossoms outside the window would complement my vibrant guest. When the winds picked up, they carried the sweet notes for miles, often returning songs from great distances and filling my imaginary repertoire with variations that would make anyone jealous.

Then, tragedy struck and there were no more happy songs; the smell of death lingered in the air around me, haunting me. I wanted to sing my own songs, ones of sorrow and loneliness. I felt hollow for the longest time, my very soul seemed sterile, and I thought that I was destined to feel that way for eternity...but then it happened; talk of new life.

I wasn’t sure I was ready but the cleansing rituals and preparations had already been done. I was nervous, scared of losing a friend that I had not yet met. All at once, the fear in me dispersed... I could hear a faint song in the distance and for the first time in a long while, I felt alive again.

The only people complaining is the ones who are buying insurance with 10-25% coinsurance because they're ignorant about health insurance.

So, there is room for criticism.

If I am stupid and break my arm I'll pay for it, but if I need heart surgery I only need to pay $3,000 over structured settlements with only 5% interest. 

I can get EKG, MRI, CT scans, see specialists  in less than a week, etc. If they're referred to be done by a doctor they're preventative care and insurance pays 100%.

Finally, there was a bunch of (dubiously ethical) studies done called the [Milgram Experiments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment). It turns out we human beings have an enormous cognitive bias (that means a rational thinking blind spot) when it comes to authority figures and being inclined to do what they say.

From the above link (emphasis mine):

*In Milgram's first set of experiments,* **65 percent (26 of 40)[1] of experiment participants administered the experiment's final massive 450-volt shock**, *though many were very uncomfortable doing so; at some point, every participant paused and questioned the experiment; some said they would refund the money they were paid for participating in the experiment.*

Continuing on:

*Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process. Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear, and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, relatively few people have the resources needed to resist authority.*

We've had her on Starting Strength with some modifications--she had to start out with goblet squats (she has such a tendency to collapse while descending) and dumbbell overhead presses.  Her biggest issue is a mobility problem around her shoulders/neck/chest due to scarring from surgery, but she's addressing it as best she can.  I would imagine that your mom might have similar issues due to her age (plus a lot of beginners tend to be ""sticky"").  Get her a foam roller and a lacrosse ball and show her how to use them, and you will go a long way toward preventing injury!

Jrodicon,skiing,1388706789.0,"&gt; Have you ever had altitude sickness issues?

Altitude sickness hasn't been an issue for me in the past. I have lived my whole life between 5000 to 7000ft. If you can handle 11000, 12-13 shouldn't really be an issue, just stay hydrated.

&gt; thinking that we can just smoke all over without issue.

The majority (not all) of the public does not care so if you guys are interested in smoking on the mountain, you likely won't have issues, but remember that it is still illegal to smoke in public and that can get you into trouble, so you certainly can't just smoke anywhere. If you're on the mountain, as long as employees don't find you, you'll be fine. I usually go off to an isolated part of a double black far away from groomers and other people. Vail prides itself on being family friendly so the less anyone sees it the better. I would think Utah would be much worse about this issue for sure. If it is something you all are interested in, Wyoming and Montana aren't as forgiving as Colorado either.

&gt; I frankly go as fast as I can getting back to the lift.

The employees always hang around the slow signs watching for people speeding so every time you are coming up to a slow sign look for them and slow it down briefly to be safe and you shouldn't have an issue. They usually give you 1-2 warnings about your speed before they pull your pass.

&gt; Why does Beaver Creek and Keystone pull 1 inch, where Breck pulls 7?

There are a lot of big mountains in Colorado, and they seem to manipulate storms just enough that moisture often gets funneled into one spot, and bypasses others. It's weird and there are lots of subtleties, I couldn't really give you specific details, I'm not a meteorologist.

There are certainly a lot of reasons to like summit, but I feel they really don't have a whole lot that other places don't have, maybe a bit more night life because there are more people, but that means more crowds on the mountain. I may be overblowing the downsides, it's still skiing and it's still fun for sure, but those little things get to you over time. If you guys decide on Summit to take advantage of the epic pass, I recommend Vail and Beaver Creek on weekends because they are further away and get less people, and Breck, Keystone, and A-basin aren't bad on weekdays. If you're there on a holiday, you're sort of out of luck, everywhere is busy around there on holidays. If you guys prefer more challenging terrain I would try to go to Jackson or Bozeman, they seemed to cater to advanced skiers/riders a lot more than Vail resorts."

TheLittleGoodWolf,MensRights,1388706852.0,"&gt;it may be more extreme because most of the patients are incontinent.

Quite possibly so yes. Both these articles assume a relatively healthy and normal person of course.

I fixed the link in the first one, but if you couldn't make sense of the second one I doubt the language is much better there.

One point in both of them is that washing with soap (I suppose the soap you use is specifically made for heavy use) and excessively (even without soap) will eventually cause damage to the mucous glands in both the penis and the vagina. They therefore recommend using an unscented oil before rinsing off with warm water.

What you were taught is essentially right, peel back wash with water, gently rub the area clean while rinsing and then put it back. Drying of the area is not damaging per se, but the area is supposed to be naturally moist, much like the inside of our eyes and mouth.

This is of course what's recommended for the average person, I get the feeling you are working with seniors (from the incontinence mentioned) if so then I would rather hear about (what I would consider) excessive cleaning than the opposite. It is quite usual to hear reports of horrible neglect in the retirement homes over here."

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388706875.0,"&gt;You have the belief that parties exist for the primary purpose of casual sex. The majority of people don't think that way. If we were to take a random poll of everyone who attended the last party I was at casual sex would not be the primary goal. 

That would be a bandwagon fallacy.  Truth is not determined by popular consensus.  That many people aren't willing to recognize that the purpose of the bacchanal is sexual libation, then that indicates that the majority of society is very confused about what it is doing.  Not that the bacchanal was used incorrectly throughout the rest of human history.

&gt;You are using the no true scotsman fallacy.

I'm am doing no such thing.

&gt; I say most people don't view parties that way and you are claiming that they are just stupid and don't know what parties are, even though YOUR view is of the minority.

That my view is in the minority does not make me wrong.  

&gt; If most people think parties are a certain way and they hold them for that purpose then that is what the party is for.

No.  That's not how reality works.  If you combine alcohol and a sexually charged situation, sex will result.  The bacchanal is a ritual developed to take advantage of this property of mixed music, dance and wine to encourage sexual libation.

This is why the Victorians and other sex-oppressive peoples banned such parties and gatherings, because they understand the purpose of such gatherings.  We, in our modern society, wish to have our cake and eat it too.  We want to party like Dionysus, and still see ourselves as Apollo.  But this is nothing more than a cultural self-delusion.  We try to convince ourselves that we can engage in the bacchanal, and that it will have a different outcome than the *very purpose of the rite*.

This is not ""no true scotsman.""  If I were saying that people who party without the intent to have sex where not actually partying, then you might have a point.  That's not at all what I'm saying.  What I'm saying is that if you've convinced yourself that the bacchanal is not rite designed to promote sexual libation, then you're delusional.

&gt;The same thing happened with marriage. It was a property exchange for thousands and thousands of years and it has only recently changed. Is that an ""illusion""? Of course not.

I don't know if you've noticed this, but the institution of marriage has been in serious state of collapse for the last several decades...ever since the rise of feminism.  Part of the reason that marriage is in collapse is because the purpose of marriage is to control female sexuality and limit the consequences of male sexual adventure.  As the need to control men and women's sexual habits has diminished, the need for marriage as a social institution has diminished, which is why so many couple are refusing to get married, marrying late, and divorcing quickly.

&gt;Saying that ""I think ___ and everyone who doesn't agree is stupid"" is a dead end, logically speaking. I provide counterpoints and you rebuttal with ""well they are just dumb"". At that point I come to realize the discussion is pointless because if actual evidence (not just ""its always been this way"", which is your argument) doesn't register with you then nothing will.

Pfft.  Who is the one being insulting now?  You haven't presented any counter-arguments, nothing but your own opinions and annecedotal evidence.  Your arguments so far have consisted of ""Nuh huh!"" and stating your opinions as facts -- that is when your arguments haven't relied **entirely** on twisting my words around and attacking strawmen.

This is your ""counterpoint"":
&gt;&gt;Women who understand that is the entire point of the bacchanal
&gt;Sex is not the entire point of a modern day party. It is a part of it, it is not the entire point. I go to parties. I'm in a relationship. I'm not looking to cheat. And I know countless people in the exact same situation.

Let's see, you start off with a strawman -- replacing my use of ""bacchanal"" with ""modern party,"" and thus **completely ignore** the point being made.  Then you back up your assertion with nothing but your opinion and some anecdotal evidence about what your friends think.  You leave no possible space at all for the possibility that you and your friends are just simply *wrong*.  

That's why we're at a dead end.  Because you have no actual argument, and I'm right.  You just refuse to admit it, because you can't accept the reality that your position is nonsensical and at odds with history and reality. You want to believe that the bacchanal has a purpose other than sexual libation.  It does not.  You claiming that it does have an alternative purpose, which notably you haven't given, does not change this reality. This is the fundamental problem with this entire argument.  Your position, ultimately, is this:  You want to have your cake and eat it to.

Well sorry, but no.  You can have your cake, or you can eat it, but you only get to choose one.

&gt;At that point I come to realize the discussion is pointless because if actual evidence (not just ""its always been this way"", which is your argument) doesn't register with you then nothing will.

Please, don't insult me and my intelligence by blaming me for your shitty arguments and inability to consider perspectives other than your own.  You have not presented **ANY** ""actual evidence.""  Your opinion is not evidence.  That your friends agree with you is not evidence.

You know what would be evidence?  If you could prove that alcohol has no effect on inhibition or judgment.  Except you can't, which is why this argument will go nowhere."

madhjsp,nfl,1388706883.0,"Guess I've accidentally struck a nerve there. It wasn't my intention to disparage Belichick, as I think he's one of the sport's all-time great coaches. 3 Super Bowls, 5 conference championships, and 11 division titles within the last 13 seasons. That's truly remarkable, a testament to a well-run organization, and an achievement for which he deserves much credit. But to deny Brady's impact on that run would be foolish, as I think his and Belichick's successes indelibly go hand-in-hand. As great a coach as Belichick is, I have a hard time imagining that he could have pulled off the same accomplishments over the same span of time with average-level quarterback play. Runs of NFL dominance like the one the Patriots have had are built not on great coaching alone, but on great QB/coach combos: Bradshaw &amp; Noll, Staubach &amp; Landry, Montana &amp; Walsh, Aikman &amp; Johnson, etc.  

In totality, Bill Belichick has been an NFL head coach for 19 seasons. In the 12 seasons in which Brady started all or most of the games, his winning percentage is 0.766. In the 7 without Brady, 0.464. I understand that 5 of those seasons were with a different team and different circumstances, and that it's not just as simple as ""Brady = wins,"" but given that these are all the numbers we have to go on, is it really unfair to suggest that even a great coach might need a great QB to get the most out of his teams?

JonnyRichter,Anarcho_Capitalism,1388706973.0,"&gt;People are willing to pay that much for goods, stores would have no reason to pass the savings along.

Yes, they would. Less turnover.

&gt;Employees are already accepting their current level of wages, employers would have no reason to pass the savings along.

But they would be willing to accept more work if it paid better.

&gt;The workers needs need to be met, 

So you mandate a policy that says a business has to pay an employee a certain amount even if that amount is more than the revenue the employee brings to the business. You're watching out for the well-being of the employee, but who protects the business-owner from going bankrupt? 

&gt;the local market has already determined the price for those goods and services. 

Take Economics of taxation. When you are willing to sell something for $5, a one dollar tax shifts the burden (incidence) such that you will make about $4.50 on that item, but will sell it for $5.50.

Get rid of taxes and it's win-win for the buyer and seller.

&gt;It is a radical sense of entitlement on the part of employers that people should work for them at a loss.

It is a radical sense of entitlement on the part of the employee that they can't negotiate their own wages, so they ask the government to force the employer to pay them more than they are worth.

&gt;If the business is not profitable it should go out of business.

At what point do we say it is the fault of the business? If the profits of a business are $5,000 a month, but you (a government) add $5,000 in costs to that business, is it really the fault of the business that they shut down?

Better yet, why do you put blame on the business owner for not making ends meet, but no blame on the employee for not doing the same? Do you not realize how great a logical contradiction that is?"

I do recommend MetroTube. It's a YouTube app. I downloaded a lot of the ""YouTube"" apps and I like that one the best (my personal preference, most of the apps ran somewhat the same). Plus, it lets me log in and watch my subscriptions :)

Oh, a nice app too is Skitch Touch. It lets you edit photos. It's great for uploading to RAoA. It lets you blur things, put arrows and boxes around things, ect. 

I'm still debating between two Reddit apps - Reddit to Go! and Redditting. I'm not sure which I like better. They are both nice.

I was saddened to learn that you can't find many Google apps on the store. So, I had no access to my Google Drive. But, I did find an app called RainbowDrive that gives you access to a lot of online drives like DropBox, Google Drive, ect. If you use those, it seems pretty good so far. Another choice is Cumulo. It does the same thing. I'm debating between those two as well :)

In regards to games, I've downloaded A LOT of game apps. But seeing as I have the RT, the processor is a little slow and some games do not run smoothly (they lag a bit, especially car or shooter games).

This can range from a snapped finger when a dinner plate gets sniffed, to a buzz from an e collar at the extreme end of the scale (which I would never use because I wouldn't know how and might mess up the dog.) To clarify, I have never needed anything more than a short but sharp tug on the leash to snap dogs out of undesirable metal state - and I rarely have to do that. Most corrections I use are much lower intensity, when they are needed at all. Things like well timed water bottle spritzes are fine by me if done properly and at the right moments, and if the dog responds to it. These are just training tools, not rigid rules that must be used on all dogs. 

Dogs are dynamic, varied things - one size does not fit all. There are many ways to build a house, not all building styles suite all terrains and geology. It's up to the trainer to be smart about it and figure out what methods the dog responds best to.

If anything, dominance theory is a gross oversimplification of dog psycology that prevents those employing it rigidly from exploring more potentially effective methods for their dog. But that doesn't mean that the other extreme end of the scale is entirely correct either."

azha84,kratom,1388707188.0,"Ime, GR is sedating and analgesic. To my knowledge, extracts are typically added to plain leaf, not taken alone. I've heard from others than when taken alone, extracts don't give much of an aroma. 

As far as dose, I've seen others take anywhere from 1/8 teaspoon to 1/4 teaspoon, added to plain leaf. Kratom is a rather self limiting plant. Take too much and you'll simply throw up. There's never been a case of anyone dying from ""OD'ing"" on it. 

I personally like it added to some good indo. I think it adds some nice depth to the burn, but ultimately it's up to you. 

I believe kratom lasts pretty well either when kept in a cool, dry place or in the fridge/freezer. I've never heard any different for extracts.

My only word of caution is to use extracts sparingly, as a treat once in awhile. More than that and they'll blow your tolerance sky high and you may not be able to enjoy plain leaf without a break.

Hope this helps. Happy burning! ~"

acsempronio,wrestling,1388707196.0,"Is Tate a wrestler?

I've coached girls wrestling for 5 years and she doesn't move like a person I would call a ""wrestler.""  She looks to be someone who knows enough to get herself in trouble.

As a coach: She didn't press hip pressure enough, she allowed Rousey to dictate her position on the mat and more specifically allowed Rousey to dictate her position relative to her own.  She routinely kept her center of balance to far forward and she made to many momentum mistakes, knowing full well Rousey's bread and butter is Judo, allowing Rousey to take control of her over and over.  Tate had a few takedowns, but Rousey almost seemed to allow them.

If any of you need a highlight video on how not to wrestle, this is it.

That said, this isn't an issue of wrestling vs. Judo.  I've grappled with a few Judo guys and my current instructor who is strong in Judo.  He is rarely successful with me; most of his take downs with me are sambo-related or guard pulls.  He says wrestlers have too good of hip presence to allow anyone close enough execute no-gi throws.

the issue here is that Tate was outclassed and out performed by a superior athlete with greater training and greater ability.

Be known boys an girls: The best fighters come from good wrestling backgrounds and the best fighters utilize grappling, both up and down, better than their opponents.  It's much easier to train a grappler to strike than it is to train a striker to grapple.

Case-in-point: Chris Weidman."

Fundamentally, it's about choice. It's about making that option available, if that is what consumers do prefer. Resource allocation will be determined by consumer preferences, not by legislation. As should be.

My father has a short temper. When I was eleven, we were building a garage in our backyard. While nailing the plywood up that makes up the outside walls, he would be outside of the garage and start nailing the plywood, and I would stand inside letting him know if he missed the stud.

Well, I never noticed any nails missing any studs. But he did, and he was *pissed* that he was duplicating his efforts time and time again.

Then when I'm twelve or thirteen, I get an eye exam and lo and behold - I need glasses! I still remember the first time I tired them on, I was floored that people could see individual blades of grass and individual leaves on trees. I had become so accustomed to the world being nothing but shape and color visually - texture was something you *felt*, not *saw*.

RichardBehiel,technology,1388707580.0,"Not really.  Divers adjust their buoyancy by filling air in what's known as a BCD (buoyancy control device).  It's basically an inflatable jacket, and at the push of a button you can add air to it or let air out.  However, it turns out that wetsuits and scuba tanks are positively buoyant (they float), so a weight belt is necessary.  Otherwise you would just float in the water, even without any air in your BCD.  

So the BCD has some pockets built into it just below the ribs, one on each side.  The pockets have zippers and you can put some lead weights in there.  If you came across a lost weight just chilling on the ocean floor, you could put it in your pocket, add a little air to your BCD, and take it back with you.  You want to minimize the amount of weight on you (for mobility) while making sure you've got enough weight to sink, but having to carry an extra few pounds if you happened to come across an abandoned weight would definitely be worth getting a free weight.

Dropping weights is a rookie mistake and can actually be pretty dangerous.  You don't want to ascend more quickly than 1ft/s so if your buoyancy is out of control and you can't let air out of your BCD in time, you could rapidly ascend and get the bends or have your lungs explode.  That's why the number one rule in scuba diving is to never hold your breath.  **Ever.** 

The guy I was diving with had only been on five dives before then, and none of them were night dives, so he was still getting the hang of it.  A 90ft night dive was probably a little outside his ability, but he wanted to try it and I lack judgment, so we decided to do it anyways.

We ended up getting stranded from the group.  Somehow the current took us east of the reef and we ended up over the sand.  The ocean floor looked like the moon and there weren't any sea creatures out there to look at, so we just did backflips for a while, in part because we were high on nitrogen narcosis.  This happens when you go below 70ft or so for a while, though the depth and intensity of the high depends on the person. 

Anyways, it turns out that my dive buddy hadn't zipped up one of his weight pockets all the way.  So midway through a backflip, his left-side weights fell out and he suddenly became 6lbs positively buoyant.  

The proper reaction in that situation is to immediately let air out of your BCD to restore your neutral buoyancy, and retrieve the weight if possible.  Being a relatively new diver, he panicked a bit and made an unplanned ascent.  Fortunately, he remembered not to hold his breath, and managed a somewhat-safe ascent speed of about 2ft/s by kicking down.  

It was a pretty scary experience, but fortunately nobody got hurt.  

Edit: The video in my previous comment actually shows this happening, though it's a little hard to see what's going on.  For the first few minutes we're just goofing around, and then he ascended and I slowly followed him up.  Originally he thought that the reason he ascended so quickly was because he ""got caught up in my bubbles"".  I've never heard of that happening, and once we were back on the boat it turned out that half of his weights were missing.  "

That's the stuff that people should be listening to, but all they remember is the more intense corrections etc. I've never been sure whether behaviours like jumping up etc are actually the result of the dog trying to assert dominance. To me it seems to be more of an excitement problem. My own feeling is that when Cesar says ""your dog is dominant, lets take him for a walk like you never do"" he's doing the right thing with the solution, but perhaps oversimplifying the reasoning as to why it was effective. 

There's still a great deal of really solid dog ownership advice on his show though, more than enough for me to generally agree with what he says. So yeh maybe he's not perfect, and sometimes his ideas get misconstrued - but I'm still glad he's on the air."

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1388707786.0,"I'll agree that having someone chastise you for choosing to be a stay-at-home mom is a negative effect of feminism. However, I'd argue that there are just as many if not more women out there who get criticized for *not* wanting to be a stay-at-home mom, in fact, you're kind of doing that right now.

While not criticizing me personally, I do happen to be a woman with no children who has no intention of having children, and you're saying that I'm selfish and that my life isn't being lived correctly. I do have to disagree with you on that. I don't *want* kids, and I don't think someone who doesn't want children should be forced to have them. I've been told my whole life that my biological clock would eventually click on but it never has, and when I have to interact with other people's kids I'm, at best, uncomfortable. I identify with feminism because according to feminism, I'm not a freak of nature or broken or selfish or evil or all the other things that women like me have been called in the past and are still being called behind closed doors and on certain corners of the internet. And really I'm not sure what this has to do with your original topic, but like you said, it probably calls for its own post.

I've heard your argument about social security and birth rates before, and I disagree with it. It also seems to me that your strong feelings about the subject are related to race, please correct me if I'm wrong.

I'm curious how you equate feminism with ""women are selfishly outsourcing their reproduction to the underprivileged women of less developed countries, which is hardly sustainable in the long run and perhaps unethical as well."" The feminism that I'm familiar with strongly supports family planning, meaning education about birth control and abortion and safe, legal access to it, everywhere *especially* in the third world. Feminism is hardly encouraging the third world to have *more* children, quite the opposite, actually. The strong opposition to such education seems to come from the religious right, not feminism."

A very large percentage of violence comes from different ethnic groups. In my time, most of the problems have been Lebanese. Some of these may or may not be born in Australia, but the traits she is talking about certainly has no basis in a true Australian upbringing.Secondly, an equal number of violent incidents is caused by or involves women. I've seen just as many women ejected from venues into the waiting arms of the police due to violence as i have men, and what's worse, is that these women then start taking their drunken anger out on the police. Of all the fights I've seen involving men, a full half of them has had some little skank on the sidelines drunkenly screaming ""fuckin smash the cunt"", urging the fight on.It's not a problem with the Australian male. Australian males are taught that you help people who need it, you defend people who need it, you don't hit women, and you only hit another bloke if he deserves it."

IndieLady,cringepics,1388707925.0,"It's a number of different factors. It starts with the fact that their food is terrible yet will not accept any level of criticism. 

The episode of Kitchen Nightmares starts with Amy talking about internet haters and how mean they are. She states explicitly that she only wants Gordon Ramsay to visit her restaurant to prove the internet haters are wrong. Amy's view is that her food is fantastic and that anyone who criticises it is just being mean for unknown reasons. So when Gordon Ramsay tells her that her food is indeed terrible, she is dismissive, nasty, makes excuses and is incredibly rude.

She is rude to customers that make even reasonable complaints and her husband who owns the restaurant is outright aggressive. There is a scene in the Kitchen Nightmares episode where customers complain about the service taking too long (I think) and it ends up with the cops almost being called.

Additionally, Amy is merciless with her staff: in the episode she fires a teenage girl just for asking a question (she considered it impertinent) and they admit to taking the tips from the servers.

All of this is awful but the thing that makes it enraging is the fact that both Amy and her husband have no humility, no insight or self-reflection, highly defensive, highly aggressive, demonstrate no empathy for others and have no interest in what anyone has to say to them unless it is praise. You have to watch the episode to truly appreciate how awful they are."

Andrew9623,AskReddit,1388707952.0,"Story time Reddit

In 10th grade I had developed a crush on this one girl I knew.  Let's call her M. I really liked M but she most likely had no interest in me. My best friend, let's call him T, developed a crush on her and she clearly liked him back. I debated what I was going to do about this for a long time and I eventually came down to three options: A) Ask out M. I most likely would've been turned down and once T found out, being my best friend, he would've backed off. I would've had some closure but neither M not T would've been happy. B) Tell T that I liked M and then asked her out. Same result as with option a. And, finally, option C) Do nothing. Let M and T do what they were going to do and be happy. Since option a and b resulted in everyone's sadness I chose option C. That is probably the most emotional pain I've ever felt. It all turned out well in the end though. About six months after I told this to T. He told me that what I did was the greatest thing that anyone has ever done for him. That was six years ago, he's planning on marrying M, and we still consider one another best friends."

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1388708029.0,"&gt;But if it is practice (and given that, based on my interviews, most Nepalese Buddhists don't have any concept of practice as being a part of Buddhism, I doubt that it is), 

I'm wondering what you mean by this. Do you speak their language and know their culture? I ask because what your criteria for practice is may not have a one-to-one equivalent in their culture.


&gt;it's practice for the wrong reasons (accumulation of karmic merit).

That's not wrong. Accumulation of merit is an orthodox Buddhist practice.

&gt;As for compassion, there are exceptions, but it shows up in the attitudes and behavior of almost everyone I met (except for the Tibetan refugees I was living with), and in the state of the nation. Your average Nepalese Buddhist would just as soon step on a beggar's hands while circumambulating Boudhai as look at him, and I did on several occasions see beggars at holy sites kicked and beaten by both monks and lay practitioners because they were in the way. The justification? They deserve it because of what they did in their past lives.

That act is obviously not compassionate, but that's not what you said. You said they have *no* practice and have *no* compassion for each other. Like I said, *how can you know?* I live in America, where we, even the Buddhists, ignore beggars because we rationalize that they should just get real jobs and they would just spend it on drugs and booze. I wouldn't say that means we have *no* practice. Our selective compassion is just messed up. They are as we are: humans who need Shakyamuni Buddha's guidance. 

I bet if you had gone to a family gathering, like a wedding, and saw how full of joy everyone was you would be calling them ""real boddhisattvas"" or something. Like I said above, they are human beings. 

As an aside, sometimes comments that contribute to the ""Asians don't know how to Buddhism"" rhetoric make me wonder if tourists expect Asian people in Buddhist countries to be Lovebots on display for the sake of their ""experience"" rather than actual people.

At any rate, if that is their reasoning about beggars (I doubt it's the only reason - plenty of social conditioning (karmic conditions) colors how we view poor people), they are half right. A person, by definition, did not have a higher rebirth due to past karma. But there are also conditions they both can and cannot control that caused their state in life. They can't control that they were born in a country virtually ignored by the economic elite, leaving little means of opportunity there, for example. So, unlike those monks, I wouldn't say their poverty is a character flaw.

So yes I agree with your conclusion about that instance, but I think you take it farther than it needs to be taken. As it relates to the article, as I said elsewhere, I don't really trust the author's account of the girl who couldn't study well because he distorts so much it's just as likely that he distorted what those monks told her in the first place. I go to a Thai temple that's full of Asian families and the focus is always on using karma to create positive conditions in our lives for our benefit and for the benefit of others.

To add my experience to this, according to my dermatologist, you can for a few months at a time, just not continuously (I have eczema on my upper eyelid/below my brow bone). It's after months upon months that you MIGHT experience issues, but even that isn't certain. It's fine for short term use, and all the hype about it being ""dangerous and thinning after a few days!"" isn't true. 

Just remember to use sparingly on the area, and not to apply more than 2-3 times a day. When you eventually get yourself off of the HC don't go cold turkey, but ween yourself off of it.

I love Tony, and I hate how much crap he gets from my friends in real life, but in this subreddit he gets overhyped (both in frequency and in amount of exaggeration.) 


I mean, it's to the point where people can't even admit when he legitimately fucks up anymore. If he throws a pick that wasn't his fault, fine. Receivers blow their routes, tips happen. But he sometimes throws a pick that was just straight up a bad decision and a bad throw, and responses are like ""you can't fault him for that, that was just a great defensive play.""


Yeah? That's a great defensive play on a bad pass. What's the old saying, you can't defend a perfect pass?



Like, he gets an unfair share of the blame most of the time, but let's not act like he has never fucked up a game before. Most quarterbacks at some point fuck up a game, especially when they're asked to do as much as Tony. Doesn't mean they suck, but they still are responsible for their mistakes. "

Blackfish is truly amazing. One thing that annoyed me about the documentary though was how ignorant the trainers were. With how much they love their whales, I feel like they would have done some research on their own, ya know? Read all they can, watch all hey can on these whales. So not the movie's fault at all. Just seemed weird."
Iwannaliveonthemoon,rage,1388708537.0,"It's unfortunately really hard to separate race and individual behavior for some people. I grew up in a small town with a lot of passive racism, and being on the outskirts of a shitty city didn't help.

It is a socio-economic issue and not a race one, but add in the media whiteness thing, like majorly reporting nice white girls who get kidnapped as opposed to any black girls in the same situation, plus it is very easy to say that since crime in certain areas is higher, and more people of a certain color live there, that it is the fault of their race as opposed to the locale in the first place.

Also, the whole tough guy thing or ""being hard"" which I see with plenty of plenty of guys from all races who are just less educated or grow up in a worse environment, is really off putting to anyone who knows the manly thing to do is to back down and not have to assert your dominance. As the Geto Boys said,

&gt; But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts
'cause real gangsta-ass niggas know they got em.

So the same immaturity I see plenty of from white people in the woods is just now in the city where things are more concentrated, and those people in the city are still a different color which makes it still easier to be racist to those who would love to pretend they are better and that problems have such as simple cause as color of the skin.

And the whole isolationist nature of black culture doesn't help either, but that one's on whites and a consequence of oppressing an entire race. That they might not want to suddenly be your best friend when other people of your skin color have been huge dicks to them for their entire history. I found this out the hard way when I asked a group of black guys who had too many for one car if they could use a ride, and they got very offensive and one tried to fight me because ""it was wrong for a white guy to offer a black guy a ride like I was better than them."" They were decently drunk, so that didn't help, but it really shocked me as a reaction to what I saw as a friendly gesture.

Racism sucks. Also if I'm being racist somewhere in this jumble of text, do let me know. I'm perfectly capable of being ignorant and not knowing it."

ashleton,changemyview,1388708628.0,"I'm going to tell you the story of when my husband died, and what I told him that helped ease him.

A bit of backstory: He developed cirrhosis of the liver at 27 years old because of a drinking problem he developed. I tried and tried to get him help, but I couldn't break through. He ended up in the hospital with liver failure. They had him stable at first, but suddenly he started going into multi-organ failure so they moved him to the ICU.

I walk up to him to hold his hand and just... look at him. I could tell by the way he looked he was struggling to stay alive, but there was no hope at that point. I told him, ""Don't struggle for me, I can't stand to see you suffering."" He said, ""I don't want to leave you."" And through tears I said, ""I know. I don't want you to leave, either, but it's your time. Energy and matter can neither be created nor destroyed, only changed in form, and you're getting ready to change form. And all that energy and all those atoms have become part of me. I love you, I always have, and I always will."" He stopped fighting after that and passed within the next couple of hours, and I sat by his bed the whole time.

Now, what you can take from that, if you like, is that what makes you as you are now, will make part of the world when you're gone. I had him cremated and scattered in a forest in a return to earth ceremony. His remains have now nourished and become part of the earth. His atoms will be realigned into new things such as plants, or people, or maybe even stars.

It may not help you with your fear of death, but it has helped me greatly and honestly I'm not afraid to die. I want to live and try to do something with my life, but if I die before I do, I'm at peace with that."

If one knows the style and think it's appropriate for you to learn the style, they can point out what you did wrong in reproducing someone's stylized reproduction. 

If it's not appropriate that you learn the style because you can't masterfully draw from life, which would be a real dilemma for anyone seriously trying to learn a style, they would probably advise you to draw from life first, at which point most expect to be ignored because nobody likes hearing that they need to do something they don't like if they want more experienced persons to relate to their dilemmas.

Tl;dr: we can't critique this because it's your invention, and you won't learn to do what great artists do this way.

Alternatively, you could develop relationships that don't require the woman to be this One Special Woman^TM who's Not Like The Others^TM.  

If you let go of the needs for monogamy and commitment, you can develop emotionally rewarding long-term relationships with women.  

The downside is you have to let go of any rules or expectations of her beyond simply ""she must treat me well"".  Oh, also you have to get good at meeting and quickly sleeping with women, but I view that as more of a perk than a downside.  :D

Most people used to embrace death as a part of life. Families used to take group portraits with corpses when they were all made up, and we used to keep the bodies in our homes until it was time for burial. I'm not sure that our newfound sensitivity to death is such a good thing... I think it probably conditions us to be more afraid of death which causes a multitude of subsequent affects on our behavior.

If you compare a man who's 5'7"" to most of the world, he's a good height. Tall, even, in someone countries (going by their reported averages). But in the US, he's three inches shorter than the mean. I imagine this contributes a good bit to people's expectations. I can't say for other countries, but the US is quite heavily image-focused. Sure, there are plenty of exceptions.

neekz0r,explainlikeimfive,1388709312.0,"&gt; From the outside it seems like it's one giant group of people who want the internet to be completely free to do its thing, illegal or not, which to me screams ""we want to maintain our live of getting shit for free"". Almost like an excuse.

Well, you are right. I'm one of those who wants a hands off approach. This is because the Internet is one of, if not the, greatest invention of all time. I know that sounds silly, but it has allowed us to have something we have never had before: communication with everyone that has it. As humans, a large chunk of our brain is dedicated to one purpose: communication. We are social creatures. The internet has changed the game for everything. 

Now, I have been working with computers and servers for over 18 years now in a professional capacity. So I know how the internet works. I can tell you that any efforts to curb file sharing will break the means that we have to communicate. In other words, we'll take what is in my opinion the greatest invention and break it to save a business model that is no longer viable. 

Just because you have made money on something, doesn't entitle you to make money off of it for all eternity. If I were to tell you that I'm going into business selling horse and buggy carts, you'd laugh at me. If I told you I had politicians that were going to ensure that cars could drive no more than 2 miles a day because it was a threat to my business model, you wouldn't be laughing so hard. 

Finally, understand this: as humans, we have a desire to exchange information. It's in our genetics. When we see something cool, we want our friends and family to see it too. This was used when there was no internet to make money. Now it's working against them. It's a battle they can not win. 

&gt; So what is that people genuinely want? 

Good question. What most people want is easily accessible content that can go from device to device and that they can watch when they want it. They also want content creators to get paid.

&gt; I mean, piratebay is called Pirate Bay. It's where you go to get your cracked version of whatever or an entire season of it. Why support that?

Did you know that there is a cost involved with pirating? It ranges from $7-30 a month, depending on how careful you are. These people are paying money to pirate. Why? Because it gives them what they want: easily accessible content that can go from device to device that they can watch when they want.

For instance, here is what I do when I want to watch something:
1) Check netflix
2) Check amazon prime 
3) Finally, after those two paid for options are exhausted, I'll download it. Which for the record is perfectly *legal*. Torrenting copyrighted works is illegal because you are distributing it. This costs me on average about $10/month to download. So essentially, I pay for it, just the money doesn't go to the content creators because they don't have what I want.

I end up hooking up with her uglier friend that I had never met that night instead of her. Not a bad compromise but if given a chance I would have dropped her in a second for 9/10 girl.

Uglier friend girl and I eventually start a real relationship. 9/10 girl and my now girlfriend are no longer friends. I have no idea why, all I know is that they now hate each other.

One day I decide to ask girlfriend girl what happened between her and 9/10 girl. She tells this whole story about how at the party where we met, both her and 9/10 wanted to hook up with me and they had a fight about it. Apparently the reason they were no longer friends was because of that. But that was okay because I got her instead, which was way better! Right? Right???

First of all - sometimes politicians have to make unpopular decisions, with the exception of populists. I'd prefer a decision to go to war be made by 200 or 400 well educated guys, who hopefully understand at least some of the intricacies, than by 300 million people who had 30 minutes to get to know the topic, and are mostly uneducated and easily swayed by propaganda or emotions.

Second of all, strong government helps to bring down mega-conglomerates and monopolies. With weak government corruption becomes rampant, and the ones with money can dictate the terms. Would you like a cure for pneumonia? Well, bad lack, those cures are now $50k/piece, because the medical megacorp bought out all the competitors, figuratively or literally kills all the would-be competitors, and has a monopoly on that. Oh, and your insurer just decided that you cannot work with them, as you're high risk due to your bad genes.

Reagansmash1994,AskReddit,1388709544.0,"A two party system isn't strange, the U.S. is a two party system. Technically the U.K. is a multi party system that devolves more power to smaller parties than some other countries. For example, UKIP essentially dominate the U.Ks representation in the E.U. we're far from a cut and dry two party system.

The newspapers are politicised but it's on a more broad spectrum than conservative and labour. It almost covers all parts of the left-right spectrum of politics and I think that this is actually a plus. News doesn't simply exist in an echo chamber but is viewed from many different angles. The British press is one of the best in the world.

Also, not all papers make a point of attacking parties. The attack ideas, themes and people. Especially in tabloids. But this is sensationalist media which is there to exaggerate things to draw in readers, and it works brilliantly. Yellow Journalism is a great way to exist as a newspaper, I for one enjoy reading tabloids to pick them apart. It's not simple stupidity from the journalists, they know what they are doing, they are in on the joke that is their newspaper.

The British press is utterly unique tbh."

""Indeed. I have met many interesting people here at the festival. There is a pirate, Captain Craw, who wants to surpass his father's legacy. There is a man with a bear. I fought the bear without my hammer. It was a draw. There was a lovely girl named Joan, who played an instrument called a 'flute'. The sound was so lovely I rudely fell asleep. And when I first arrived on the island, I was hungry and on the edge of death. A kind chef named Adrian fed me out of the goodness of his heart.""  
  
*Orville thinks about all the people he's met at the festival, a big smile on his face. In the mines, everybody knew everybody else, but there was nothing worth knowing. The experience was all the same: Work and pain. But here, in free man's world, there are people who are different and interesting. He turns back to Souji.*  
  
""Sadly, I am not sure that these people would fit on the crew. They wish to have fun, and have their own personal, smaller ambitions. But you, I believe, are different. Our crew right now is made up of two former slaves and two former nobles. We all have problems with the way the world is run, and I suspect you feel the same. You have mentioned a man who you would like to kill, but you have not said who. When I look at you, I see things similar to the pain and rage I have inside myself. When we first spoke, I thought maybe it would be best to ignore such things, but I believe the only real cure is to fix the problems that anger us in the first place. Tell me, Souji, what do you know of the darkness of this world?"""

IndignantChubbs,TrueAskReddit,1388710565.0,"For me this question is one about the nature of private property as it pertains to the workplace. In our present form of economic organization, capitalism, the workplace is owned by one or more individuals. That being the case, dictating the information a company must offer potential consumers is very tricky. It's kind of like forcing homeowners to alert potential visitors to the cleanliness of their home. If a company is some individual's/individuals' private property, then anyone *using* the product of the company should bear full responsibility for that use.

However, I don't think workplaces ought to be owned. Property isn't an inherent property of anything; it's an artificial way humans create order in the world.  Property is therefore a concept that should be fitted to real-world circumstances in order to make things as good as possible. Our right to property is adjustable -- if you disagree, consider whether you think your neighbor ought to have the right to property of a nuclear weapon. That right should be uninfringed upon unless there is a justification for limiting it in specific circumstances, in which case any community should be able to democratically limit the right to property within that community.

In that framework, I do think there's a strong justification for limiting the right to property of workplaces. Essentially, the justification is that those who provide labor to a company, and those that use the company for consumption, are much more involved stakeholders than the shareholders of the company. Ownership of a company should be jointly held by those who workers who spend their workdays in it and the community the company serves. Managers should be employees like the rest of the workers (and that can be attained by organizing workplaces democratically rather than autocratically) and capital should be held by a community, not by the upper classes of a society. 

That's not the only way to frame this issue -- I can grant the legitimacy of private ownership of workplaces and advocate regulation of the workplace on utilitarian grounds -- but for me that's the core issue that this question raises. In my view, because autocracy and centralized control is inherent in private ownership of workplaces, and because I believe in classical liberalism's emphasis on the right to self-government, capitalism's concept of private property is illegitimate. The economic sphere should not be so coercive an environment, in which workers are forced to submit to external demands or face the substantial consequences of leaving their means of support. 

TL;DR Yes we have the right to everything we want to know because companies should be considered partially owned by the community, though they are not currently. Democracy should be applied to the workplace, and so democratically-supported demands for information should have force behind them."

This isn't a big societal issue because there's a lack of public interest in such things and there's very little that could be done about that minus activism. Confewdents isn't a cure all, just a boost.

There will be women turned off by height, it's a thing more of preference than anything else. It shouldn't be taken personally. I don't take it personally when women are turned off by my having a smooth head. I don't think it's 'baldism' but I do think that I will get looked at differently by future bosses and/or clients due to my baldness. It bothers me as much as I let it. 

I disagree with nothing else you said, and sometimes I do come across as condescending or like I'm not taking reality into account. But I genuinely understand it sucks for some groups to be the way they are, and that they are at a natural disadvantage.

I particularly like the section on the different height individuals and one being seen with more confidence, though. It's absolutely 100% true in cases of males at least, I don't know about females as I haven't ever seen any get judged negatively for being overly short. And that has more effects on their lives than just relationships or fighting discrimination. I wonder how that could be helped."

ender2021,AskMen,1388710826.0,"I think the reason _Shingles suggested asking him what he does during his ""withdrawl time"" is that it might give you some insight into why he wants it.

It's also a nice, non-naggy way to open up this topic of discussion with him.  You can start by asking what he does during his alone time, emphasizing that you are just curious and want to learn more about him.  It's important if he does tell you, that you not judge those activities or otherwise imply that you feel negatively about it.  That discussion could lead into asking what he thinks about, or even whether there is anything you can do to help facilitate that alone time.  The more understanding and genuinely curious you are, the more he is likely to open up about it.

The bottom line, IMO, is that guys need/want alone time for a variety of reasons, but often feel that they can't express this need w/o offending or upsetting their SO.  If you make it clear that his need for alone time doesn't bother you, he might be happy to talk to you about it.

For example, I became a CLG and Curse fan mainly because of Saint, but I still am a fan of both of these teams, because over time I grown to like the others, so there I people I am rooting for, even though they are not the original reason why I started rooting for those teams.

If Curse would've realeased Voyboy and Cop too(well, Cop was realeased for a short time, but he came back, so...), I probably wouldn't be a Curse fan anymore.

Same with EG and Alliance. I came for Snoopeh, the other grown on me, so now I like both EG and Alliance, but if Alliance would've been formed as it is now, and the EG team would be 5 completely new people, I probably wouldn't care too much about EG, while I would still be a fan of Alliance.

Sure, performance should be the top priority for the teams, but LoL fandom is a lot more personality based than traditional sports, so in my opinion /u/Dyr0nejk2 is totally right when he says this rate of change is good, because it's not too slow, but not too fast either."
Syncdata,nottheonion,1388711171.0,"See, that argument is simply nonsense though.

Let's take culture, religion, and race out of this entirely.  Let's imagine a town called ""Rapesburg"".  It is called Rapesburg, because, whether you are a man or a woman, if you so much as drive through the town, you have a 20 percent chance of being raped.

All races religions and cultures are represented in this town, it's just a 5 mile by 5 mile town in which rape is endemic.

Now, you have a job interview, and there are two ways to get there.  The quicker way is to take your chances, and go through Rapestown.  Or you could get up two hours earlier, pay to cross two bridges, deal with traffic, just to get to the interview on time.

Note, we are simply talking about geographical discrimination here.

Which do you choose?  Of course the second option.  Even though you have an eighty percent chance of only meeting good, non rapey people in rapesville, no person in their right mind takes the quick route.

What's more now she's being legally punished for being raped and he's getting away.

A better way to deal with that would probably check for signs of rape, then if there was literally no evidence of rape or non-consensual intercourse, and the woman's character is questionable, I think there definitely should be consequences.

Either way I think it should be provable beyond a reasonable doubt that the guilty party is guilty in rape/rape accusation cases, otherwise the raped with have even more of a reason to fear coming forth other than being scrutinized for being victims.

Edit: Because of some confusion, I'll say it straight, I used some language that was purposefully over the top to draw attention to the ridiculousness of the idea of imprisoning rape accusers. You CANNOT let a handful of assholes who go out of their way to ruin someones reputation be allowed to ruin the system put in place to protect the abused and punish the abusers. Even if it means some innocents get caught in the crossfire unfortunately.

It's not that hard to imagine yourself on the other end, Your boss gets you drunk, and forces you to have sex with her, no telling or it's your job.

Since the battlefield is unspecified, I can think of two scenarios.

If they are fighting in some kind of Arena, with knowledge of each other's powers and identities, Light writes his name (as it's only one name), and Maxwell kills/disables Light, then dies.

If they meet with their identities hidden, on the hunt for each other, it's different. They would be put into a city, told about each other's power, and sent to hunt.
Light starts killing a bunch of people from a distance in one area, or perhaps controls criminals into attacking civilians for Maxwell to save. After identifying Maxwell by observing who saves the civilians with the notebook powers, Light would create a scenario where Maxwell saves him from a mind controlled criminal, and in the aftermath, he would do something like this:

""Thank you so much, I d-don't know how I can thank you properly for saving my life! What is your name?""
""No problem! I'm Maxwell""

Because if you're close to the endzone, you may not be going for distance, but instead for inside the 20.  And in that, the Hawks were just a little bit better:

[Jon Ryan](http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/gamelog/_/id/10238/jon-ryan) 37.8% of punts were inside the 20 with 6.8% touchbacks.

[Johnny Hekker](http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/gamelog/_/id/15153/johnny-hekker) 24.4% of punts were inside the 20 with 5.1% touchbacks.

Ryan more consistently got it inside the 20, but did so with a slightly higher rate of touchbacks.  Hekker had less touchbacks, but also less inside 20 punts.

TRK27,boardgames,1388711882.0,"As you might have guessed from my flair, I love Ginkgopolis. It's probably one of my favorite games. 

First, to answer your questions - 

* I've played Ginkgopolis a total of 72 times - about 2/3 of these plays have been online at [boiteajeux.net](http://www.boiteajeux.net/). It's my third most played game after Magic: the Gathering and Race for the Galaxy.

* I like almost all of this game. What I dislike about it will be much briefer to list - occasional lack of a feeling of control (I'm eager to try the ""keep two"" variant outlined in the expansion rules), the lack of a tiebreaker, the need to mill cards off the top of the deck in 2-3 player games, and the chaos that comes with higher player counts. 

* I prefer to play with two or three - much more strategy comes into play with those player counts, especially two players. However, you also have to mill cards off the top at those counts, which is a bit inelegant.

* For two players, 164. My opponent scored 125 in that game. For three players, 104. It's really not that meaningful though, because scores will vary based more on the flow of the game than the skill of the players - it's not a game that goes for a set number of rounds, I mean.

I'll post additional thoughts as I think of them.

Slyfox00,actuallesbians,1388712074.0,"&gt;So today, while hanging out with my best friend, I asked her how she would react if her friend turned out to be a lesbian. She said she would stop being friends with her.

She doesn't sound like much of a best friend.

Best friends care about **you.** Not what's between your legs, and not what you prefer between your partner's legs.

&gt;I knew she didn't like gay people, but I still believed she would be somewhat okay with it. I had the urge to write an email to her where I would say who I actually am and that I'm very hurt by her words, but I can't. I'm not ready to come out yet. I realize that I might end up alone.

I'm sorry, I really am. Her attitude is rotten. This subject is hard to deal with and very scary. When you are ready to tell people, tell the people you trust. By the sound of it, that's no longer your best friend.

This isn't easy, stay strong... things do get better. Once you start coming out to people you'll learn how much they really care about you. The people that accept you for you can become even closer friends."

There was also the girl who I came out as bisexual to, because I considered her someone I could trust, and the first words she had to say on the subject were ""I don't believe in bisexuality."" She contacted me on facebook two years later to try and make amends, I told her I wasn't interested, and she threw a fit. Meh, fuck her.

Honestly, if he were presented with compelling enough evidence I think Nye would be happy to change his mind, and thankful that someone was willing to convince him he was wrong.

Richard Dawkins has a quote related to that, and I like to think that any decent Scientist would strive to have the same attitude:

&gt;I do remember one formative influence in my undergraduate life. There was an elderly professor in my department who had been passionately keen on a particular theory for, oh, a number of years, and one day an American visiting researcher came and he completely and utterly disproved our old man's hypothesis. The old man strode to the front, shook his hand and said, ""My dear fellow, I wish to thank you, I have been wrong these fifteen years"". And we all clapped our hands raw. That was the scientific ideal, of somebody who had a lot invested, a lifetime almost invested in a theory, and he was rejoicing that he had been shown wrong and that scientific truth had been advanced.

Of course, given the subject matter of the debate, that's...Not very likely. But I'm sure he'll go in there with an open mind at any rate.

Gertiel,AskReddit,1388712511.0,"I've also had a lot of expensive drinks, some through business, some back when I worked in a bar in college. Mostly whiskey, bourbon, rum, vodka, wine, and tequila. My experience of wines is pretty much the same. Really, the biggest return with wines is learning to pair them well with the food to me. I'm probably as opinionated as anyone as regards what I like to drink, but it is like magic in your mouth when the pairing is really good. Found that out in college when a friend brought a bottle of a wine I'd never have bought to have with a roast I cooked. I still don't like that type of wine by itself, but I always have it when we have roast beef.

As far as spirits are concerned, perhaps the prices are different in your area. For me, my favorite tequila runs between $45-70 a bottle depending if you cross the border to buy it. My favorite rum ever I picked up at a craft distillery for $40 a bottle. For me, whiskey and bourbon break between $60-80 per bottle depending, so those are the most expensive. I've only ever had cheap swill as far as scotch goes, and I'd really love to try a good one.

For those people who say never use a chisel. I would have to disagree to an extent. I have seen more than my share of peoples stitching come out uneven, or spaced oddly, because they tried to force their stitching holes with an awl. 

A chisel, just like an awl, has its uses, and you should not restrict yourself to only using one tool, based on the biases of a a few people. You can do professional looking work with a chisel. It has more to do with the person using the tools than it does the tool itself.  "

In terms of popularity and sales, it's slowly catching up to league, with the International (pretty much the World Series of Dota2) quickly boosting the community up once a year. 

For now, League is at the top, but if Riot doesn't find a way to quell **both** the community and their financial needs/wants, it'll slowly but surely deteriorate throughout the years, much like HoN right now."

testudinidae,homeowners,1388712962.0,"Water treatment guy here.  Both chlorine and chloramines at sufficient levels can make your water taste and smell like bleach or pool water.

Chloramines are added intentionally by many municipalities because they have a much longer half-life in the water distribution system than chlorine, so they can maintain the disinfectant effect to the far corners of the system.

Since both chlorine and chloramines decompose over time, the closer you are to the pump station that serves you, the higher your dose.

You can reduce the chlorine content of your water by installing a carbon filter.  A whole house unit is the same size as a water softener, minus the brine tank.  This is not always a good idea if you can avoid it because the disinfectant effect of the chlorine helps prevent you from contracting diseases like [Legionnaires' disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legionnaires%27_disease) from your shower.

Lots of people don't like chlorine taste in their water, and are worried about consuming [chlorine byproducts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfection_by-product).  If that's you, you can get some [pretty nice in-home water filtration systems](http://www.uswatercompany.com/at-home-or-work/water-systems/q-culligansupregsup+drinking+water+systems-88) to address your concerns."

My dad made me join the track team and soccer team and literally told me, I shit you not, that it would ""build character"". I usually found myself loitering around after school long enough so my parents wouldn't notice I wasn't attending practice.

It was such a strange comic for a kid like me growing up, because most kids in movies/tv shows/comics/whatever never had anti-social issues (and if they did, they were usually put under a humiliating, condescending spot light) and it just made you feel like there was something wrong with you.

You seem to be so beat down that you don't have much hope for anything, don't pin that on just therapy.  Let a professional help you.

If the person you go to see doesn't appear to be putting together a plan after a few weeks, move on and find someone who will wrap some structure around the therapy plan.

You can get through this, and you're under no obligation to do it all by yourself.  It's almost impossible to short-circuit an obsession by yourself, you need someone else to hand you some cleats (in the form of skills you can use quickly and for the long term) so you can get traction."

I love my daughters dearly, but I did not love being pregnant and it really just created more animosity in my relationship that bonding.

I also am not a big fan of the baby stage of child development. Babies are cute, but I look forward to getting a good night of sleep again. I am also very happy that I got my tubes tied last week.

And really, pregnancy is our thing. In ancient times, women who died during childbirth (which was very common) were often considered honored dead who were celebrated in a similar way to soldiers who died in battle. Men get to feel so fucking superior about everything else (they're physically strong, they get to be providers). Why can't we have pregnancy to ourselves?

danman11,bestof,1388713494.0,"&gt;SpaceX attributed their cost efficiencies to a few primary factors.

&gt;1. Workforce ‐ Total vehicle DDT&amp;E costs are primarily a product of the total workforce needed to accomplish the effort (SpaceX workforce numbers substantiate their development cost claims)

&gt;2. Organizational complexity – SpaceX estimates that every dollar sent out of the company actually costs between $3 and $5 based on subcontractor overhead and profit

&gt;3. Infrastructure ‐ Total infrastructure required for the DDT&amp;E effort and
infrastructure utilization percentage.


&gt;These factors suggest that reducing the total workforce; number of management
layers and infrastructure can substantially reduce DDT&amp;E costs when compared to
traditional NASA environment/culture.

neekz0r,explainlikeimfive,1388713528.0,"&gt; It is my understanding that inbreeding is bad for the survival of the majority of species of animals, and that high diversity and gene flow is beneficial.

True.

However, you are thinking too small scale. It's not like a new species is created after birth. 

That is to say, take two humans. They mate (for examples of this, check the internet) and produce on offspring. That offspring, no matter how mutated, will still be human. Now, that offspring may or not be able to produce.

Now, take a group of humans and move them to a planet that is exactly like Earth. Fast forward about a million years. The two groups reunite. 

Now, due to a million years of separation, these two groups would likely not be able to mate. In fact, they probably wouldn't recognize each other as human, while proclaiming that they themselves are the true humans. 

They both started off as humans, but they evolved to suite their surroundings and the changing conditions of what they considered attractive mates.

citadel_lewis,relationships,1388713586.0,"&gt;Saying that someone not involved in the relationship is at fault for them being in that relationship is ridiculous.


I'm not saying that at all. I'm asking if it's really okay to leave the guy's wife in the dark, therefore living a lie? It's the husband's fault, but OP could empower the wife with knowledge. 


&gt;OP has enough issues right now what with wondering what's going to happen to his own relationship as worrying about the child involved. To burden someone in that position to take part in a relationship he isn't involved in in any way is adding extra problems onto a person already in a delicate position. 


I'm not asking him to go to counselling with them, am I? He lets the wife know and that's that. How is that even remotely ""taking part in a relationship""?


&gt;He is is no way obligated to talk to the man his wife has been cheating with or that man's wife. 


Of course not. Neither is he obligated to protect this man or keep his wife occluded to the fact that her husband doesn't love or respect her. He can exercise his free will. I'm just saying that I'd be mighty pissed off if I was the wife and found out I was the only one involved to not know the truth, because everyone else had decided it wasn't in their interests to let me know. Really goddamned angry.

This is something that I've always wondered about.  Why hasn't testing been done on ""artificial gravity"" by spinning a spacecraft?  You'll need a spacecraft with a large radius, but [Zubrin's idea](http://marssettlement.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/ag-tether-2.jpg) of tethering the capsule to a counterweight and then rotating the system seems to be incredibly efficient in terms of mass/radius.

In retrospect, I think 37 just kind of sucks.  My husband's 37 was pretty crap as well.  Now I'm about to turn 42 and I'm stoked and brave and doing things in my career and getting serious about my writing.  And some stuff has happened - we lost that house I was sure we needed to buy in order to qualify as grownups, my husband hasn't been especially consistently employed in about 3 years, we made a scary move that neither of us regret for a second even though it could have gone badly.  We very definitely didn't want to have kids, but I did worry about whether I'd have angst about it as I approached the end of it even being a possibility.  (Nope.)

Things get better, they really do.  Everyone I know in their 50s talks about how their 40s were the first time they felt like they had any idea what they were doing (and didn't get a decade out and go ""holy crap I was stupid then"" either, which is basically how I would sum up my 20s and 30s)."

89rovi,teenagers,1388713959.0,"Come to think of it, I had one a few days ago.  I wasn't doing anything for new year's eve, so I decided to go out for a walk.  This was at around  9:30ish-10 pm, so it was pitch black out.  So I'm walking down the street, listening to music, nothing too out of the ordinary.  There were a few groups of people scattered around, what with it being new year's eve and everything, a lot of them were probably totally plastered.  So as I'm walking by, I see some dude in a snapback pissing on a tree.  What.  I keep walking, and he goes and catches up with his group of friends who were up ahead, they were about 8-10 people.

This is where it kinda starts to get weird.  I can't hear them talking or anything because I have my earbuds in, but I notice these people are continually turning around and looking at me while they're walking, and they're also slowing down quite a bit, to the point where they're walking right in front of me, very slowly.  This kinda freaks me out, seeing as I'm alone and they're in a big group, so I cross the street and walk on the other side.  Everything's fine for about 30 seconds, then I turn around and see they've also crossed the street and they're fucking following me.  At this point I'm totally freaking out, thinking I'm gonna get jumped or something.  Luckily there was a subway station right ahead of me, so I just went in there and they didn't follow.  "

Definitely gained much of his hype in his confrontation with Lebron where his quiet yet intense concentration and energy gained him a lot of fans. 

He's in one of the best systems in the game right now under Pop who will bring out the best in him as he loves hard workers and good defenders. Likewise it must be amazing to be with the big 3 in San Antonio learning. 

He reminds me of Iggy in that their great defenders and can do it all. And I was so hype when the Spurs drafted him (they are my second favorite team) because I knew he would excel in their system being a fantastic fit. 

However, the system is also hiding some of his true potential in that Pop loves to limit minutes and use a more team-oriented playstyle instead of letting the kid loose and chucking out 15+ shots a game.

I can definitely see him becoming a regular in the all star games and hopefully a member of Team USA."

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388714067.0,"I think that's a bad analogy.  Here's a better one:

When my mom was 19, she moved to San Francisco and lived two blocks of Haight &amp; Ashbury.  This was in 1969.  One of her roommates was this super liberal white dude from Connecticut.  And one day he comes running into the apartment and says ""I just got robbed!""

And my mom's like ""What happened!"" and he tells her the story.  He had just bought a brand new transistor radio and was walking back to the apartment with it when a young black youth accosted him and demanded the radio, so he had given it over.  And my mom was like ""Oh my, so he threatened you?""  And the dude is like ""Well, no.""  And my mom is like ""But he was really big and scary, and you felt intimidated?""  ""Well, no.""

After some intense questioning, it turns out that what had happened was a twelve year old black kid on a bike had rolled up alongside him, asked him what he was carrying, and when he said it was a radio, the kid had asked ""Can I have it?""

And he'd handed it over.  Because he was scared what the kid would do if he said no.  The kid didn't threaten him, intimidate him, or really do anything to him.  He just asked ""Can I have it?"" and he got it.

So, is the kid a thief?  Because according to you, yes, the kid is a thief.  Yet, according to most people, my mom's roommate is an idiot.

What do you think?  Black kids a thief, or white guy is a racist idiot?  I ask because, based on some of the rape stories I've heard, there's an awful lot of ""rapists"" running around that are about as guilty as that black kid."

The has been perfected over the years my mom and then me, it's a secret family recipe. I haven't seen anyone make it the same way, and the are well known enough among my friends that I could be identified by most of them through this recipe. My mom's cookies come out cakier than mine, but I pretty much whip the dough using my kitchen aid.

This recipe includes the secrets that we usually leave out(read forget) when giving the recipe to others, because I just made them.

* 2 cups flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 sticks butter
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* 1 cup golden brown sugar
* 1 tsp (generous) vanilla
* 1 egg
* 1 eggshell of water
* 2 (generous) cups chocolate chips
* 1 cup nuts chopped (optional, makes a drier cakier dough)

Oven 375

Combine dry ingredients(flour, soda, salt) and set aside. Cream the butter in a mixer, add sugars and vanilla, mixing after each. Add egg and refill the shells will water. Mix until dough is fluffy. Add dry mix to the dough in steps so that you don't create a flour storm in your mixer/kitchen. Once it's all nice and combined it should still be pretty fully. With a spatula stir in chocolate chips (and nuts if used). Portion out on to parchment lined sheets. I use a small scoop. Cook for 9-12 minutes depending upon dough temperature and oven reliability(mine sucks so each was different when I made my double batch for Christmas last night). Enjoy at least one while still warm but not longer squishy because they are amazing.Also, these freeze well so if you bake them to give out you can do it well ahead of time.

William Binney and Thomas Drake, both well-respected and connected operators, went to the oversight committee with much of the same information that Snowden had, as they were supposed to, and they were promptly ignored and black-balled. Binney reported (though with little substantiation) that he was continuously threatened and harrassed by phone and in person after his attempts to correct the situation.

As a comparison, how do you feel about the Pentagon Papers and the Watergate material that led to the impeachment of Nixon?  Ellsberg has personally come out in support of Snowden, and believes that the actions of ""Deep Throat"" and Snowden are identical in nature and similar in scope.

masterx25,leagueoflegends,1388714290.0,"Everything Valve has done with Dota2 has shown us that they aren't focused on ""winning"". They not trying to have the bigger player base or financial growth, they are focused on making the better game.  

The only thing Valve has contributed to the pro scene is the International. Everything else is organized by the fans.  

This is the best comment I can find on the difference between Riot and Valve business model toward their games: 

&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRRf6lJ3ygA[2]  

&gt; James 2GD Harding interview  

&gt; Fast forward to 20:00 up to 30mins  

&gt; ""I've always felt there were 2 types of companies, one would let the product speak for itself and one you'll not hear about the products. And I always find Riot wave their flag a lot higher than anyone else, just because they want you to be riot riot riot from the next game on and so you just love that.. And the interesting thing about the International is did you ever see a valve logo? Nope.""  

&gt; Letting the product speak for itself instead of monopolizing the esports scene.
&gt; Quality and features, that's the real reason why Dota 2 deserves the E-sports of the year award. The best spectator client, twitch interactions , fan interaction features , features that give power to the community and help make the game flourish.  

&gt; Again, its not about the money injected into the scene by the developer nor the giant player base that a game has. Its about the product itself."

itsmevichet,AskReddit,1388714366.0,"&gt;But if this is reality then why deny it

There are people out there who handle reality by looking at it, saying ""okay,"" and then dealing with it like they've always known and adjusting their behavior accordingly.

And then there are people who never get over ""the truth,"" whether that truth is dating, mortality, the state of the world, or the fact that they ran out of soda and the store is like, 4 blocks away.

All of your worrying is just mental masturbation. I can't force you to quit it, and you're unlikely to make any changes right away. This isn't something that will flip overnight for you. All I can say is that in a few years or even a dozen, you will hopefully have more experiences that will better inform your confidence about how to get what you want out of life.

And then, as Joe walks away, you scowl at him from behind and call him a thief, because he was so fucking rude, asking if he could take money.  He's a thief because you told him it was okay, but you feel he shouldn't have even asked and forced you to say no.

Or, or, maybe, it's more like you got drunk and Joe asked if he could grab the money in the jar to go get more beer, and then in the morning you were like ""Shit, i was saving that money for rent!  Joe shouldn't have asked me while I was drunk, Joe stole from me!""

neekz0r,explainlikeimfive,1388714521.0,"Information Technology refers to the management of information; now a days most information is kept on computers. Thus, Information Technology is managing computers and the network(s) that connect those computers.

&gt; What do you do and how many variations are there?

There are a lot of variations out there. Here are but a few:

* System Administration (managing computers)
* Network Administration (managing the network and/or telephone connections)
* Security Administration (managing the security of both computers and networks)
* Patch Administration (keeping the software on all the above up to date)
* Database Administration (keeping databases healthy)

&gt; Furthermore, what skills should you focus on in order to get a degree? Finally, what jobs are available to you with an IT degree?

I'll be honest; most degrees for IT are crap. Usually, they offer ""computer science"" which is about as helpful to IT as being a great cook is to running a restaurant. At first look, it seems like it would be so. But running a restaurant requires an entirely different skill set.  Most companies that you would *want* to work for in IT value experience over a degree in it. In fact, companies that require a degree in IT/Computer Science should be avoided like the plague. 

So, here are some traits you have to have to be comfortable in IT:

* Be comfortable reading lots of boring technical docs
* Be very curious about all things computers
* Have mental spatial rotational skills
* Be comfortable with abstract concepts

Skills you should have:

* Communication communication communication. This is why I hang out on ELI5 and answer technical questions over and over again. It helps fine tune my communication skills.
* Computer hadware/software knowledge (of course)
* Network knowledge (of course)
* One or more programming languages. It doesn't matter which ones, what is important is that you understand how programming works.

blackinthmiddle,firstworldproblems,1388714559.0,"Same here. I always leave a pair at work. However, I sometimes forget my bluetooth headphones (that I carry with me everywhere). I travel an hour each way every day on the train. There is no worse feeling than realizing I have no headphones for the train! All it takes is one clown to decide they want to turn the train car into their personal office to ruin it for everyone.

Once, while coming home and forgetting my headphones, a woman got on her phone and it was clear she was just bullshitting. You could see her literally going down her address book and dialing everyone. I swear to God one conversation went:

""Hey, it's me. Susie. From the party? Yeah...I was the redhead...no, the other redhead!""

At this point, people were audibly gasping and one person shouted out, ""Hang up the phone! The other person doesn't even know who the fuck you are!!!"" At one point someone balled up paper and threw it at her. She didn't give a damn and kept talking! Another time a guy tried to get a guy to be quiet and he cursed him out so badly that *I* felt bad! ""Turn around you cocksucker!!! Do you know who the fuck I am? You want a piece of me when this train stops?"" The conductor let him know that many people complained and if he doesn't shut it he'd be thrown off. The moment the conductor was out of earshot het kept right on talking. Sounds weird, but being on the train without my headphones can actually be stressful. A good set of headphones that drop the decibel level by 20 points is my second best friend, my iPhone being my first!"

**The Draft**: It's not huge, but one of the main routes for acquiring young talent, particularly for lesser clubs. Last year some of the most effective young players (Dillon Powers and Deshorn Brown) came out of the draft and typically each draft will produce a handful of young players capable of playing at a high MLS standard. I'm not the most informed on college players but from what I've seen and heard reciprocated from more knowledgable NCAA followers, Patrick Mullins, a striker from Maryland, is supposed to be the top player in this draft and will likely end up with DCU (who have the first pick).

But they were able to generate a small amount of artificial gravity, about 0.00015 g, by firing their side thrusters to slowly rotate the combined craft like a slow-motion pair of bolas.

[Source.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_11#Flight)

So was the artificial gravity the original purpose of the tether experiment, or was it just a clever solution to keep it taught when it turned out that Earth's gravity gradient wouldn't do it?

I have siblings on each side.  I got two birthday celebrations and christmas celebrations ever year!  And my dad ended up eventually remarrying someone amazing and it makes me so happy to see him so happy.  On the other hand, my aunt stayed with her husband for the kids, which made her miserable.  Towards the end, at different points, my older cousin said something like, ""Seriously Mom, why haven't you divorced Dad already?"" and my younger cousin said, ""Mom, I think you should leave Dad.""  Both cousins loved their dad, but could see how toxic the relationship was.  It's important for people who believe in staying together no matter what to realize that kids see more than they think; eventually they can subconsciously begin thinking certain things are okay or normal.  

I think it's always worth trying to fix, unless there's abuse, but if you try and it doesn't work, move on.  Stay on good terms with the ex, work out custody fairly (again, as long as there is no abuse), and try to find happiness; your kids will want to see you happy and see a good example of a happy person!"

Vilhu,malefashionadvice,1388714758.0,"The second shirt works better with white pants, I find that the contrast of The NYE fit is a bit much. You're fit, but the fit of the clothes in NYE-fit look boxy. I believe you'd be much better off with more slim-fitted shirts, and pants that taper more. 

General advice for the white pants is that they're a prep staple, and work grate with other prep staples (such as a light blue OCBD). 

I really like fit number three, fit looks on point. Although I want to point out that bolder patterns are often associated with femininity, which for some reason is associated with homosexuality. Wearing a shirt like that, with colorful chinos and three buttons open (fifty percent more than usual), can give off a gay vibe. It sucks that it is that way, but the perception of the public is hard to change. 

When I wear my florals, I generally pair it with my raws (jeans) to create a more masculine vibe.

Mine is literally the opposite. He firmly stands on, ""the customer is always right!""

It annoys me to **no end.** Especially now that I'm a manager and have some authority and have to deal with customers and complaints more. I handle things the way I believe it should be handled and I don't let my employees get treated like shit - and I've been bitched at every single time.

Example: Guy calls up and wants to use a credit under his name (if a customer has something happen that warrants a credit, we put a note under their name/#..like a free pizza or whatever) and wants it delivered. I tell him that's fine, but I still have to charge him our $2.50 delivery fee. Why? Because it's a totally different day/different driver and  I'm not sending her out for free. Our drivers get $1 per delivery. I'm not gonna make her drive almost 5 miles for nothing. I have no idea if you're gonna tip her (no matter how many times he insisted he would, I still don't know - and I'm not skimming her on her $1 because someone else messed up yesterday), and it's rightfully hers. It's a whole $2.50 and he's getting a large specialty pizza for free. No big deal, right? Wrong. He's fucking **livid.** He doesn't feel he owes her or us anything because we messed up his order *yesterday.* That's on us. Which, yeah, that's on the store. Not her, personally. We keep going back and forth for almost 30 minutes. He doesn't feel he should have to pay anything to get it sent out, and I keep telling him that:
A) She only gets $1 of it. The rest goes toward her work provided car insurance.
B) I don't even have the authority to take off the fee because of reason A.
C) She isn't the same driver and I'm not the same manager. Neither of us even know what got messed up. If you had wanted it sent out yesterday, it would have been sent out for free. This is a different day.

He ends up giving in and agreeing to pay, but makes sure he gets my name. I gladly tell him my name, my GM's name and when he can call to speak with him personally. I didn't feel I handled it wrong. I was polite the entire conversation.

He complains to the owner through our site, to corporate through their site and complains to the BBB. All three of which have to be updated on by my GM, personally. My GM flips and tells me to never do that again. Next time I don't charge them shit. I found out later that the driver still gets their $1 but it shorts our drawer at the end of the night a $1 every time  it's done like that. Whatever. Not my problem. As long as my driver doesn't get fucked and I'm doing it how he says? Not my fault if your drawer is short at the end of the day. It just blew my mind that he felt he didn't have to pay and my GM agreed. What made me mad was the GM had *no idea* that the driver still gets their $1 and didn't seem to care. It's shit like this all the time. "

Ensurdagen,INTP,1388715019.0,"To add more now that I'm at a computer, an emotion is a particular kind of sensation. Sensations result from something, but it is often very hard for us to discern exactly what is causing particular sensations. Emotions can react to our thoughts, but they don't obey them.

In Buddhism's refreshingly simple freedom from context, an emotion is like stumbling. They are both sensations that arise spontaneously, sometimes we think we can tell why and sometimes we can't, and ignoring them is a lack of awareness. Of course, stumbling must be dealt with immediately, while emotions are more subtle and more forgiving--which makes them easy to ignore. You can keep stumbling on purpose, just like you can keep feeling emotions on purpose, so keep in mind that ""regarding"" isn't the same as ""maintaining."" Good emotions can be maintained as well, making your other sensations happy (thoughts, actions, sensory input) will let you create a chain of good emotion.

A thought is a similar sensation, which arises spontaneously as part of a chain or even as a reaction to an emotion. We INTPs often choose not to ignore thoughts, and we create chains of them readily. Awareness meditation trains the mind to perceive all sensations and let them work by themselves, rather than focusing and directing. As actors, we have the freedom to strongly influence our sensations; but, without meditation we may wear deep mental ruts that we don't like to climb out of. Physical actions are also sensations, some feel conscious (walking), some don't (heartbeat), and breathing is both :)

Of course, all of this is a bunch of metaphors to describe my experience, I await the day neuroscience can explain the actual physical shape of it all."

DaEvil1,changemyview,1388715101.0,"This all relies upon what exactly ""existence"" really means. Is there really a definite ""I"" residing somewhere in my brain? If there is, what exactly is it, and how is it defined? Are we a combination of the biological structure of the brain in combination with the electric communication with the nodes? If that is the case, what exactly is the tangible touchable ""I""? Unless we go beyond what science teaches us, there really is no satisfactory answer to these questsions that doesn't end up with the conclusion that the ""I"", I experience is not infact a seperate thing that can come into existence and popout of it. The inevitable conclusion is that my identity is merely an abstraction of my ever evolving body and mind with a sense of identity present with the purpose to control and use this body I live in.

Thus the conclusion to your inquiry becomes: There is no need to be afraid of not existing at a future point because ""you"" don't really exist now. ""You"" are an illusion that will cease to illude other people the moment you die. Nothing is actually lost upon your death. There is no ""you"" that escapes from the body or dissapates into nothing.

EnergyCritic,AskFeminists,1388715293.0,"It's not ""assumed"". It's well researched and a fairly simple explanation. 

First, understand that the purpose of patriarchy is to give men control over women. 

Following, we see that through the military many acts of oppression occur to women. Women are raped by soldiers. They are forced into prostitution to satisfy soldiers. In many countries, still, they take care of their husband's property while he has gone, but still have no rightful ownership of it. Even now women in the military in western countries are raped by fellow soldiers they have been ignored for the purpose of ""stability"".

Historically, all of these things are exacerbated. Also, my statement is not to be construed as excluding the violence against men in war. However, I am demonstrating how feminism argues that the military is an instrument of the patriarchy."

10thMuse,AustralianCattleDog,1388715493.0,"My advice based on our Great Flea Epidemic of 2010 (we only had cats then, no cattle dog yet, but same advice).

1. MAKE A ""SAFE"" ROOM where the dogs can live for at least a week (other than brief, supervised trips through house to get outside). Clean/wash all bedding and clothing, vacuum everything, wipe down all surfaces, if carpet use flea powder along baseboards. The idea is that it's super clean so later, if you see fleas, you know they came from the animal.
2. DE-FLEA the dogs. The only thing that worked on our cats was drowning the fleas in water/Dawn dish soap and combing them out with a fine-tooth comb. Use Dawn or another regular, oily dish soap (fleas can't survive in it).  Fill up a bath tub.  Put a ring of Dawn around the dog's neck (so fleas can escape up to their head out of water). Submerge dog in tub with only head out while you suds up their body/legs.  Keep them submerged for a couple minutes... the fleas will drown and many will float up dead.  After about five minutes, use a fine comb to go through their coat, especially their arm/leg pits and right by their butthole.  Sounds gross, but this last bit is important... fleas will hide there.  Any remaining live fleas must be picked off and squished. Also, talk to your vet and find a good long-term medicine that will work... I think your problem is fleas hiding in the house, but longterm of course they still need meds.
3. QUARANTINE. Put all pets into the safe room and prepare to leave them there for a week or two (aside from brief trips through house to get outside).  Buy the anti-flea room powder and spread along threshold of that room &amp; around any baseboards of carpeted areas.  
4. CLEAN/WASH all bedding and clothes, drapes in the rest of the house.  Vacuum everything.  Wipe everything down (we found flea larvae up on top of kitchen cabinets even).  Use anti-flea spray or powder along baseboards in carpeted areas, under couch cushions, etc.  
5. MONITOR both the quarantine room and the rest of the house.  Every day, spread out a white sheet, put the dogs on it, and shake their fur... if you see black bits fall onto the sheet, put some water on the black bits... if they turn red, that is flea poop, repeat steps 1 &amp; 2. Check their butts, and comb them through every couple days. Re-vacuum the house every few days.  Check the rest of the house for fleas &amp; flea poop every day.  If you've seen no evidence after a week, congrats, you have prevailed! 

Yes, I realize this plan probably sounds fanatical. After weeks of hideous infestation, this was the only thing that finally worked for us though.  Good luck!

I've used all three, depending on the floor. If you use the planer, expect to buy new blades and to sand the floor after - they take the gunk up like nothing else, but tend to leave irregularities in the floor which are pretty easily sanded out.

Computer programs that, under certain circumstances, buy/sell/hold stock. In other words if the program sees a piece of fruit start to rise, it'll make the decision to sell stock in fruit companies. 

&gt; Why is it important? 

Because it can make or lose lots of money for lots of people. Additionally, because the algorithims can make unpredictable decisions. These decisions can have dire consequences for either the company or the stock market. For instance a mistake cost one company $440 million.  More disturbing is this:

*Algorithmic and HFT were shown to have contributed to volatility during the May 6, 2010 Flash Crash,[16][18] when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged about 600 points only to recover those losses within minutes.* [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading#Concerns)

HFT is ""High frequency trading"" aka, Algorithmic trading. 




&gt; Where can one learn to program these algorithms? 

You can learn to program one online. However, lots of money is spent on talented programmers and even more money is spent on keeping the algorithms that companies use safe and unseen.

Do you believe that somehow the intentions or goals have changed within waves from being empowering to women to being a victim?

It's really hard to respond to this to be honest, because you kind of assume feminism is just one big blob of a movement and every member is alike. 

&gt;This is most vividly seen in the blogs of ""Tumblr feminists"" -- young women who, rather than embracing the tremendous freedoms they have and seeking to make meaningful careers for themselves, instead assign themselves to perpetual victimhood. They make charting their own victimization, mapping the intersections of their oppression, their primary hobby. Rather than empower themselves, they scream at the world ""Why won't you empower me!!!""

I honestly don't think that is a valid source of criticism of the movement as a whole. These represent only a few possibly mentally ill memebers of a huge cause with many sections to it."

If your friends can't pay for shit, then they either need to stop hangin with you or elevate their fuckin game. You're doing them a fuckin favor just being their friend.

I never buy shit for people that aren't immediate family members (then it better be a holiday or a birthday). Friends? Fuck that. No way, no how. You'll find out real fast which ones are really your friends by cutting them off from the money.

As for money concerns . . . stop being a bitch. One of the biggest truths you have to learn about money is that it's just a tool. It's a thing and not an end in itself. Goosing socialization with cash is weak as fuck, and women will smell that bullshit out in a heartbeat.

You use money to build a good look, but you don't use it for anything else in game. Your money can go into a good car, fine. It can buy a trip to Paris, fine. It can dress you, and it can get you from here to there, fine. 

Beyond that, your money better be going in to building an empire or a nest egg.

You'll be astonished how quickly things switch when you stop paying. People want rich friends. People will PAY for rich friends. Do you have any idea how many celebrities get PAID to show their faces at clubs and parties?! That's the mentality that you need to develop -- the pure ""gosh, why am I even here"" mentality. People eat that shit up."
Buscat,leagueoflegends,1388716085.0,"Another thing I want to add, which I was bringing up quite often during the LCS streaming contract debacle:

Valve makes their money through steam. Dota2 is a way of bringing people to steam and keeping them on there, but they're never going to do anything for dota2's sake that will prove risky from a PR standpoint and have people start questioning whether their primacy in the digital retail realm is healthy. If it fails it's not the end of the world to them.

Riot, on the other hand, depends on LoL and LoL alone. If it fails before they get other games going, the company goes under along with all their future plans and everyone loses their jobs. 

So keep this in mind when you compare how Riot handles running their game versus how Valve does. Valve has a different set of interests to protect, and a different business model."

spyhermit,trees,1388716194.0,"I'll try to be definitive, therefore verbose:

1. Permits have been approved for Growers, at this point. That means that once they complete the necessary construction, bring in the plants, and start growing, it's a complete grow before product will be ready. 

2. During this period, the state will be doing the permitting process for distributors, who the growers will sell to. 

3. Once the distributors are setup, then the state will begin the permitting process for retailers, who will sell it. The odds are good that this will take until June/July, so the growers will be building stocks of product for which they have no market for a few months. Once this is all done, the shops will open and weed day will begin. 

There are MANY caveats to this, however. 

4. There are MANY communities and counties that are currently ""Dry"". They've voted in restrictions stating that weed can't be sold. You can view a list of these [Here](http://www.cannalawblog.com/current-local-i-502-regulations-or-bans-in-washington-cities-and-counties/)

5. You still can't smoke in public. 

6. There's significant debate about the legality of hash oil, and about gifting marijuana. 

7. Medical MMJ is still in a very bad place in the state, they're arguing about it now.

Hatewrecked,news,1388716208.0,"&gt;So that 5th round draft choice didn't get them a better punter

Does anyone here actually watch football?

* The Vikings' front staff is incompetent in the first place  
* The difference between Kluwe's 2012 stats and Locke's stats are negligible. Seasonal Avg/Net stats change by a bigger margin than 0.8/0.5 every few games, if not every single week.
* Even if you don't want to pretend a margin of 0.8/0.5 isn't negligible, remind yourself that Kluwe had a worse rookie season than Locke  
* Kluwe was one of the highest paid punters in the NFL, while Locke was dirt cheap

And lastly...

* **HINDSIGHT IS 20/20** 

It's not as though the Vikings sat down and said ""yeah this Locke guy will give us slightly worse stats, but at least he isn't a fag."" There's literally no telling how a rookie will perform in the NFL. Look at the stories of Tom Brady or JaMarcus Russell if you want to see how unpredictable draftees will be in the NFL.

In reality, the Vikings saved a shit ton of money on a guy who looks like a promising young punter. Chris Kluwe was released from the Vikings and signed up with the Raiders, who dropped him before the season started because he was not even good enough to be a fucking backup. Now Chris Kluwe is having a cry about it and blaming it on his homosexuality. This is a ridiculous story and Chris should be ashamed to try to use his sexual orientation as leverage for his floundering NFL career."
beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1388716212.0,"That's the thing though: you're being *very* optimistic when you say it's an ""opening up of oneself to be challenged."" They're not, really. They honestly think that if someone comes in and says ""you're wrong, and here's why"" that their totally uneducated opinion is just as valid, because the other person is biased. ""Biased"" as in educated, as in paid an expert to teach them things and read accepted academic treatises instead of blogs.

I've seen my voting ratio on issues of feminism and sociology all over reddit, it's not pretty. Nothing I say is untrue or even radical. It's white bread totally mundane Sociology 101 sort of stuff. Pointing out that I have a degree in philosophy and experience in research in related matters, plus being in law school, drags the conversation down to an even nastier level, where it's down to question intellectual integrity time or just plain make shit up. And don't point out that someone made shit up about a subject they know nothing about, that will *really* get them mad.

Some people have a bone to pick, and they're going to pick it. They don't want an honest exchange of ideas, they just want to tell you their talking points. To be perfectly honest, there's certain topics of drama on reddit that I can pretty much chart like clockwork. I *know* what subjects they're going to bring up, because they're all from the same echo chambers. It's so bad I ever know what *studies* they're going to post.

Once that happens, it's game over. I do enjoy intellectual conversation, sometimes even stupid ""bowling alley"" conversation. What I really don't like is someone who is convinced they are super informed about something they are *completely* ignorant about, and aggressively ignorant about it. That's proselytizing, not ""providing insight.""

I would be being facetious if I said *everyone* on reddit is like this. But the people who get into drama on certain topics? Yes, pretty much every day."

It's much less convenient for the farmer, but adequately supplies the entire field with irrigation - as opposed to the central pivot which doesn't yield as much crop from the corners due to lack of water.

smootie,college,1388716479.0,"Succeeding after college is all about who you know, and a school that will let you meet/collaborate with people in your field is worth the extra cost.  

I know that ""campus life"" seems really important to you right now because you're a freshman and you have certain expectations about what college is supposed to be like.  However, the reasons you listed for wanting to transfer are pretty immature and you know it, which is probably why you can't tell your parents.

There is something to be said for having successful classmates and friends (and fraternity brothers).  But it is highly unlikely that your peers will be in a position hire you or give you an internship since you'll be graduating approximately at the same time."

Set the rules, then enforce them from the get go.  When they aren't listening, don't move on to an activity they like to do, or only let those that are listening do the next activity while the others need to wait until they start listening.

Also, start my grabbing their attention.  My favorite thing to do to get their attention is saying, in a normal voice ""If you can hear my voice clap once.  If you can hear my voice clap twice.""  Keep adding different things to the ""if you can hear my voice"" because it forces them to do what you're saying and I usually end with ""If you can hear my voice have a seat"".

As for one-on-one, I tend to crouch in front of the child and have them put their palms into my palms and make them hold eye contact, forcing them to focus and listen to what I'm saying."

They will never love and understand animals the way an animal ~~crazy~~ person will. For context; I adore animals. I'm the drunken Snow White at the party, making friends with pets. I take walks down to the dog park with no dog of my own and people ask if I've met their dogs before because they're so familiar with me. I send out animal loving vibes. 

My ex ""only liked cats"" but that barely qualified. He grew up with a cat of his own but the cat stayed with his mother when he moved out and got married. His ex wife didn't like having the cats on her. My cat sleeps under the doona. My ex didn't deal well with that. 

After three years, he went from ""I don't like dogs"" to ""I like them but I don't want one"" and I wondered why I was wasting energy with someone who would never value the same things I did. 

My mother was also right about the following: 
* High School is not the best time of your life, it's the worst.
* People will always find a way to be miserable and they will take you down if you let them.
* Don't think you need a man if you only want children. That was from observing a family friend.
* Sex isn't love. That was a fun tidbit blurted out on a long car ride when I couldn't escape.
* If you're paying for a holiday, aim to be more comfortable than you are at home. That doesn't mean luxurious facilities, it just means that you can focus on relaxing.

ANewMachine615,AskScienceFiction,1388716716.0,"The Ring doesn't give gifts. It offers power, at a terrible cost. It doesn't give you ambition -- Gollum should be example enough of that, hiding for centuries at the bottom of a mountain, killing orcs and fearing the Sun. Certainly not out to rule the world.

The One Ring has two primary powers: it draws you into the spirit world, as do the Nine given to Men. It also allows you to exert your will over others, in proportion to your will. Frodo is able to bind Gollum to him, for a time. Aragorn could've made his nation worship him, until Sauron crushed him. Gandalf could've challenged and perhaps defeated Sauron himself. The thing is, though, that type of power is inherently corrupt and corrupting. It is Power with a capital P, the exertion of your will to negate the will of others, and it cannot be wielded in a way that doesn't corrupt you, drain you, make you evil even if you try your hardest to be good. And the Ring cannot be used any other way -- it is a hammer, and it makes the whole world, good or evil, into nails.

Frodo was successful because the entire Quest was directly blessed by God. I'm not even kidding; this is actually the sole reason and the sole way he could've succeeded."

I do have to say, color corrector takes a lot of work. you can typically dye your hair right after depending on the type of corrector you use, for instance, the first one I used was a sulfur-based that just shrunk the color molecules. Then you stand in the shower for an hour (small exaggeration) washing it all out or it will re-bond with your hair.

if you look at a globe, it's easy to say ""oh, the north pole is on top, antarctica is on the bottom.""

this is pretty much meaningless- is there a real reason that one pole would be considered the ""top"" and the other the ""bottom?"" you're looking at a model not on its own, but judging it based on earth beneath you

flyingcatpotato,childfree,1388717062.0,"I think too it must be that children's classes are the dojo's bread and butter so i get it from a cash money point of view.  What i don't understand is why the overlap isn't built into the schedule.  If the kids class keeps running over, then have the adult class start fifteen or thirty minutes later. That is bad planning on their part.  

It is like when someone is late to work- just because on paper their commute is 30 minutes, but 9 times out of 10 traffic makes their commute 45 minutes, then they don't have a 30 minute commute.  Same with kids classes. Kids are slow to pack up, they fuck around rather than clear out of the room, parents always want to bs about their special sneauxflaykes, building the delay into the overall class schedule would make sense rather than losing paying adult customers."

RochelleH,AskMen,1388717079.0,"I got into good physical shape because it helped my self-esteem and how I projected myself, I guess. I also wanted my interactions with others to be less coloured by how I felt about myself. I wanted to be kinder, be free of envy, and not act or speak out of envy, hurt, or vitriol. I think that comes across. Whether or not that broadens possibilities with men, or the physical improvement itself, I don't know. I have had better luck love-wise since getting in better shape, most definitely. i guess you as a man know better if you can feel when a woman transmits confidence and if that is important, or if the physical aspect prevails. So yeah, it could be physical, but I like to think it's mental, too. 

With that boost in self-esteem came higher standards insomuch as how I allowed men to treat me. Where in the past I would have put up with certain behaviours in relationships, I stopped putting up with them and demanded more for myself. I'm not talking this ""I'm a Princess and I demand respect"" shit that's so common now; I'm talking basic respect that both men and women expect from their partners in relationships. I was able to walk away from potentially harmful or self-destructive relationships, speak up when I should instead of keeping quiet, and not agonise over being in a relationship or not. None of this was because I suddenly imagined myself to be the shit; rather because I liked myself and could see I had other possibilities, or at least, that I was deserving of them and trying to be a good person. 

What hasn't changed is the ""guardedness"" with letting go emotionally and being completely open with feelings and affection. I think it will always be there. That trust and affection still takes a while to give, and self-esteem is a precarious thing for those that have been without it or had it damaged. Sexually? I never had hang-ups or shyness, strangely enough, so that hasn't changed, but I am probably more secure about being naked around my partner, don't try to hide parts of my body, etc. Again, I guess that is a relief and more enjoyable for men, as opposed to a girl insecure about her body."

d3gu,cringepics,1388717143.0,"My ex (whilst dating him) came round to get rid of a cranefly for me. He only lived the street down from mine, and I have a huge phobia. I promise to provide tea and biscuits for the service, as he wasn't supposed to be coming over til later and I was interrupting his afternoon. I hide in my room til it's gone, proclaim him my hero, smooches etc. &amp; then put the kettle on.

Cranefly flies into my face from behind kettle, I run off screaming as he laughs. Said he only did it to get free tea.

Like I mentioned, he's my ex now but for other reasons too. As in, his idea of clever humour is tripping someone up on their way past, leaving meatspin open on someone's work laptop or belittling someone. After we broke up, he tried to hook up with 2 of my best friends, one of whom is openly gay!. Me, him and the other friend met up for drinks, and when she was in the bathroom I asked about why he thought I'd help him get a date with her (he'd always hated her when we dated, but she is hot) he laughed &amp; said, to my face, 'But we get on so well, we both think you're a bitch'. Hmm. My friend &amp; I left, and he rang saying, 'what, it was a joke'.

Needless to say he has been single ever since, but I know he did try to get back with his ex &amp; then me a few years later, and tried to sleep with one of his friend's ex's the day after they broke up.

InterwebCeleb,vita,1388717173.0,"&gt; Actually, Tearaway, a game now being hailed by many, has an actual story to it that makes it good. Nintendo is missing it's Tearaway for me. It's a game people talk about because of it's story.

You lost me here. Not because you don't know the difference between its and it's, but because you blindly state the 3DS has no story driven games as though Fire Emblem, Monster Hunter, Devil Survivor, Resident Evil: Revelations, Ocarina of Time, etc don't exist. 

&gt;But please, I'd buy a 3DS if they were much cheaper than they were now.

A 3DS and 3-4 games is cheaper than a Vita and the cheapest memory stick, so bringing cost as an argument is just silly.

&gt;I don't get why some people in this sub hate ports.

People don't hate ports. I mean, people do hate *bad* ports, but the port argument is valid. If a system is mostly ports, why pick it up? You pick up a system for its exclusives. If the PS4 and the Xbone had the ***exact*** same games, you would only buy 1, right? So why would you pick up a Vita if every game on it was available on PC? You wouldn't. So in order to actually decide the worth of a system, it is best to not include ports in the discussion UNLESS they are the definitive port (ie the fact that the single best version of Chrono Trigger is the DS port due to it having the PS1 cutscenes without the PS1 lag issues).

&gt; At least Sony is trying and at least countering the ""Vita has no games"" logic.

No they aren't. How many TV ads have you seen for the Vita or any of its new games? How about internet ads? I've seen nothing. Nothing at all. The only reason I even found out Tearaway was a game was this subreddit. We're talking a praised game, by known publishers, that had zero marketing. A game that made many people's top 10 of the year and yet there wasn't a single ad anywhere. It sold abysmally, in a way that makes WiiU sales look amazing. Sony has put the same amount of effort into supporting and promoting the Vita as they did the PSP. None.

To take this from another direction, it sounds like he's bitching that people on Stack Overflow are just garnering points by reposting something they got from an easy Google search.

When I Google search a problem nowadays, I usually come across Stack Overflow at the top of the search results. If people didn't provide answers that were easily Googleable, I would not be finding the answers on Stack Overflow, but rather on any number of disparate sites, many of which I'd be unfamiliar with the layout of, and which I wouldn't know whether or not to trust.

Having these exact same answers on a user-moderated site like Stack Overflow means that I'm finding the answers on a site with a familiar layout, which I know to trust, and which frequently provides multiple possible solutions.

**TL;DR** Stack Overflow is compiling the answers you'd normally get from Google Search results. I think this is a good thing."

Stopped reading. Start watching football before you talk about it.

Locke is a rookie and his stats were both better than Kluwe's rookie season stats and approximately equivalent by an extremely negligible margin to Kluwe's year, and Kluwe was one of the highest paid punters in the entire league. Locke was thought by many NFL analysts to be one of the best punters in the draft.

Also, even if Locke was a total flop (which he certainly was not), you have to remember that hindsight is 20/20. There is absolutely no telling how a player will perform in the NFL. As far as Locke goes, Minnesota is getting an alright performance for the price they paid. As for Kluwe, he was picked up by the Oakland Raiders shortly after being booted off the Vikings, and he was dropped before the season started because he performed shitty at camp."

1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 cups tapioca flour (no substitutions!) ~250grams
1 egg
1/2 cup shredded cheese
3/4 cups grated parmesan cheese. 

Bring milk, water, butter, salt, and garlic powder to a near-boil on the stove. Turn off stove. Pour flour into the pot and mix thoroughly until a dough forms, parts of the flour may look translucent after being merged with liquids, this is ok. Let the dough cool off for about 10 minutes (until you can handle it). Meanwhile, preheat oven to 425. 
Transfer the dough into a bowl and crack the egg onto the dough. Thoroughly mix the egg into the dough, add in the cheese and knead the dough until all the ingredients are fully incorporated and the dough appears uniform. The consistency should be somewhere near soft play dough. Rip off walnut sized chunks and place them on a greased baking pan. Bake for 20 minutes. Let these cool for the tapioca to set.

WeaklyDominant,TrueReddit,1388717647.0,"Summary/stuff I find interesting to consider:

* Understanding people's emotions and motivations can be used to manipulate them if you have that intent--something at which sociopaths are very skilled. What is it that allows these people to identify and understand emotions in other people but not really feel the emotions themselves?

* Are certain industries more disposed to certain types of emotional intelligence? For example, the article highlights salespeople as doing better at their jobs when they can identify and regulate emotions. I would imagine that sales fields that thrive off continued relationships (e.g. business vendors) would attract 'altruistic' EI, and that one-off sales relationships would attract more nefarious ones, but the article doesn't really speak to that.

* What is the impact on society that we consider emotions in terms of 'costs' and 'benefits' to the workplace, as opposed to natural expressions of our feelings? Is it perhaps bad for people's mental health to think in those terms (or have those terms thrust upon them)? Should we consider our emotions separate from this framework if we want a healthier perspective?"

That's why i am just confused over what i should do. These are the things i can think of right now.

1: Just honestly tell her that i have feelings for her over the phone and if she doesn't feel that way back just let it be and ofcourse not be needy or keep pushing it and if she would have any slight feelings back see where to go from there. If this happened i would gladly make the 7 hour trip during a weekend or so. 

2: Just let things flow as normal and keep having the friendly contact with her. (and maybe get friendzoned) 

3: Just let her go. This doesn't mean stop talking to her. Just give up on the entire love thing since there are so many obstacles atm.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388717815.0,"&gt; This is probably going to sound conspiratorial, but I've come to believe that government actions, particularly in terms of business regulations, are usually the result of powerful interests seeking to protect themselves from competition. 

To an extent, they are.

&gt;I like Libertarians because you can trust their skepticism of government authority.

Skepticism of government is sometimes a good thing but what about the power of business?

&gt; One of the fundamental premises in support of government authority is that the agents acting on behalf of the government will act almost altruistically, that they will ""do the right thing"" and not commit subtle acts of corruption. 

Well we would like our governments to act in this way, wouldn't we? I understand that they don't, but I think we need to look at why that is, and correct it.

&gt;To me, government agents, legislators, administrators, etc. are people just like everyone else. They suffer the same subconscious faults as everyone else. 

Mmhmm.

&gt; Most people will not be ""fair"" and they won't even realize they are being unfair.

It's a problem, I admit it.

&gt; Their reasonable self-interest biases their decision-making, and they are probably blind to the fact that they are biased.

Fair enough.

&gt;They subconsciously show favoritism to the very companies that, due to their size, are capable of creating the most damage! I don't see positive outcomes coming from this. 

Legitimate concern.

I would like you to consider one thing though. How does a lack of intervention from government play into this? As someone who favors government intervention, The choice to not play the game at all is still a choice. A decision to not rule, is still a form of rule. A lack of action, is still, in a sense, an action that affects the lives of many.

While I can certainly understand the problems with our government making policies that favor the rich, I think you should rethink your idea of, as a result, doing nothing at all. Many government regulations are put in place because a lack of regulation creates all kinds of problems. Regulations and the like, are why we now have laws that require workers to recieve fair treatment. There was a point in time where businesses could do whatever they wanted to workers, and it wasn't pretty. Lots of people lost arms and legs in machines and crap. Consider the minimum wage. While yes, small businesses are hurt more by it, who would be hurt by a lack of it? Many people, wouldn't you agree? Workers would.

And how would small businesses survive if we got rid of those pesky anti trust laws and stuff like that?

The point is, I understand where you're coming from. I understand why you have problems with government acting the way it does, and favoring those who it favors. I think these are valid problems that we, as a society should address. However, I don't think that a lack of regulation is necessarily the solution. IN many ways it could very likely make things worse. Sometimes a lack of action is just as pro corporate interests as flawed legislation is, if not more. Getting out of the way enables businesses to make decisions that hurt us. A lot of big businesses would LOVE for the government to get out of the way and let them pollute the air, pay their workers low wages, overwork them and treat them like crap, collude and stamp out all competition, etc. Think about that. I see the problems you see, I just don't think government getting out of the way is an adequate solution."

I work in hazardous sites cleanup &amp; remediation, and I absolutely love my job; very rewarding and once you're in government, there are a ton of opportunities to move around and not be worried about losing your job.  In my state, all entry-level openings in the department come through taking one test, not sure how it works in CO.  So I did well on the test, got invited to a few interviews for different programs and then took the first one I landed.  As far as compensation goes, everyone starts out at $40k and then after 2 years you get moved up a pay grade and can make up to $70k, and into six figures if you move into management eventually.  Private industry pays better and doesn't move as slow as the government can sometimes, but the hours can be long and jobs can be slashed if contracts fall through, etc."

Austenismyhomegirl,relationships,1388718249.0,"I hate to jump on the reddit break up train but why do you feel this woman is the missing piece for you?

You have told her how certain behaviours hurt you and she makes next to no effort to accommodate you or meet you half way.

For myself, being with someone needs to bring more positive than negative to my life. There are things that are important to me that this person must have/do. For example, physical affection and quality time are two big ones for me. If you are too busy and/or aren't a touchy feely person, the relationship is not going to work for me.

Secondly, she blatantly ignored you and treated you like a buddy instead of a boyfriend, in public. At what point do you say enough is enough? Are you happy being her emotional safety net?

There's someone out there who will meet you toe to toe and appreciate what you bring to the table relationship wise, this girl doesn't.

Letting her know your feelings is key here if you do choose to stay with her, but if she shrugs it off or doesn't treat this conversation/your feelings with some importance, that should be a big flashing neon sign to you that perhaps this is not the girl for you.

Good luck OP. I'm rooting for you!"

animuseternal,Buddhism,1388718455.0,"I think this depends a lot on why you're asking this in the first place. 

Is it to figure out if enlightenment is even possible? That would tell me that you're not a Buddhist. If you aren't a Buddhist, does verification really matter to you? Would it affect anything?

If you aren't Buddhist but are interested in it, then I would first start to derive more practical benefits if study and practice. The Third Noble Truth is the truth that the path to the cessation of suffering is knowable. The more you meditate, the more easily you can accept enlightenment. You will know brief glimpses of pure blissful dispassion. And when you know that enlightenment is possible, that is when you can more readily accept enlightened beings today. 

If you are Buddhist, then you will already trust these claims, for they come from trusted sources and practice the dharma clearly at every moment. When you have practiced long enough, you will more easily recognize individuals with high levels of attainment. And you will awe in the presence of those who no longer give rise to karma. "

I've never understood people who think that ""heaven"" is for people who are afraid of death. Everyone harbors some fear of the physical act of dying, but as for what lies on the other side ...

... Until some time in my teens, I was **terrified** of the idea of any form of ""heaven"" ... living eternally, forever conscious, no respite from existence, under God's judgment. I would lie awake *every night* in immortal terror. Also, an orthodox view of heaven necessitates a belief in Hell. God is not easy to please, so there's a good chance that one would be spending that eternal existence enduring the worst possible tortures.

Contrast this with eternal rest and the annihilation of consciousness. I know which one I'd be most afraid of. Thankfully, my perspective on what happens after death is not so fear based anymore."

TotallyNotSuperman,batman,1388718863.0,"I loved the first page, and hated the second.

The brooding loner who never accepts any help from anyone is dull. It's even worse when the story goes out of its way to make sure that the character actually doesn't need any help. Ever.

And that's exactly what Arkham City did. Time after time, Bruce was in a position where he could have benefited from help. But it's *always* turned into him doing something on his own.

* Robin shows up? ""I had it handled!""
* Alfred managed to create something that can help? Mad Hatter decoy.
* Mr. Freeze is in a position to help? Something happens that requires Batman to *force* him to help.
* Catwoman actually helps him? He shrugs it off.

The entire plot is about Batman being in a vulnerable position, but he spends the entire game not being vulnerable. The one time the plot didn't save him from needing help (Catwoman's aid), he has no knowledge of it, so he never actually learns anything.

The story basically says ""Batman is so badass that even while minutes from death, he's so stubbornly adamant that he refuses to acknowledge his weakness. And he's so badass that the universe immediately puts him in position to save himself.""

But the second page is annoying. Batman sucks as a character because he doesn't use lethal force? Seriously? I'm sorry, but the Punisher is actually over at Marvel; the author would probably really enjoy that.

Batman is all about getting close to lethal force but never actually crossing the line. He makes all kinds of threats, and then he immediately knocks them unconscious with a single blow to the skull. Yeah, he's really soft on the crooks.

And at the end, Batman *did* make a choice. He was going to save Joker, and the Joker died knowing that. Sure, the decision was taken out of his hands, but the decision was still made."

Sarahmint,Naruto,1388718887.0,"Hiruzen said himself ""I entrusted Danzo with *the seedier side of the village*"".  First, why would there be a seedier side of the village to begin with?  That alone is bad governing.  Danzo was trusted as a Hokage the same way each Kage trusted each other (not very much).  It was Mifune who exposed Danzo as a manipulator before an explanation was interrupted by Zetsu (who used Sasuke as a political pawn in creating the next war, which Sasuke had little or no part of).

Sasuke's actions have benefited the ninja world.  No matter what the reason, the majority of his actions had a positive effect.

Sasuke killed a head of state.  Of course he is in hot water.  They have no idea what kind of man he is.  To the world, he represents the will of fire, not the corrupt delusional monster he really is.  I agree with this entire paragraph:
&gt;That being said, don't whitewash Sasuke as some humanitarian for killing Danzo, and here's where my second point comes in. The fact remains that Sasuke killed a sitting head of state. Moreover, he killed a sitting head of state after the terrorist network he was affiliated with declared war on said state. 


However this:

&gt;Danzo was perfectly justified by ordering the massacre of the clan.

~~reminds me of the people who justify the Armenian Genocide. (to which no person would outright admit it that I know.)~~ No. these people were killed in their homes by their comrade in arms along with their entire families, friends, and loved ones.  They were not arrested or charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government.  They were flat out killed.  What kind of lowlife gets that kind of treatment?  The brave and strong shinobi who dedicated their entire lives (and limbs) to the safety of the village.  The guardians of Konoha were all killed because they started to ask questions and wonder why they were not getting any better treatment after all their hard work.  A coup is not a civil war.  It is a forced change of leadership.  Hiruzen was a weak leader that sent his own village into ruin.  Who kidnapped 60 children?  Orochimaru and Danzo.  Who turned Akatsuki into the violent terrorist network out of the Peace Power it was suppose to become (eventually returning the favor with the destruction of the village)?  Danzo.  Who ordered the death of Hiashi?  the Raikage and Hokage Hiruzen.  Who allowed the 9-tail attack on the village? Minato and Madara's apprentice.  Who allowed the further oppression of the Uchiha clan and eventual death?  The entire Konoha counsil.  Who sent the most powerful shinobi into Akatsuki to strengthen it?  Hiruzen.  

It was apparent the Hokage needed to be changed.  Anyone who dared suggest that was killed."

SAIUN666,buildapc,1388719015.0,"In budget builds I feel like the extra cost of better motherboard and CPU cooler for the AMD could just be spent on an i5 instead, which outperforms an overclocked FX6300.

Example: where I am the difference between the cheapest 760G and 990FX motherboards is $120. A Coolermaster 212 is another $40. The price jump between an FX6300 and i5 is only $70.

IMO budget builds are about the cheapest motherboard that can do the job and no overclock on the CPU. Overclocking isn't really free because you need better parts."

Yes, I'm well aware of that. Kluwe was dropped **before** camps started. He was dropped on May 6th, and training camp for the Vikings didn't begin until July 26th. Speaking of which, he was picked up by the Raiders shortly after he was dropped, but then the Raiders dropped him before the regular season because Kluwe performed worse in training camp than both Marquette King and Sebastian Janikowski, and Janikowski is nothing to write home about in the first place. Yes, that's right: Kluwe was worse than the Raider's backup punter. No team in the entire NFL is showing any interest at all in Kluwe. What was that you were saying about his performance?

Also, why are you shocked about a fifth round draft pick for a punter? Is homophobia really your only explanation for such a phenomenon?"

dianthe,dogs,1388719248.0,"I don't have a Husky but I have two Samoyeds which are a related breed so here are a couple of things I would add to what's already been said:

- Desensitize your puppy, once a day just pick him (or her) up and look at his teeth, touch his paws between every finger, his tail, his ears etc. Most puppies hate it at first but get used to it after some time. Just keep doing this until your pup is 5-6 months old, it will be great help with any future vet visits, grooming etc. 

- On the topic of grooming, get your puppy used to being brushed early, if you can afford it buy a grooming table with a grooming arm as that will make grooming in the future much easier. *Never* leave your puppy/dog unattended on the grooming table with the grooming noose around their neck, for obvious reasons. Make the first grooming session very short and give plenty of treats and praise, gradually make them longer. Husky coat is easier to keep than a Samoyed coat but still requires a decent amount of brushing, especially when they are blowing their coat. 

- Get your puppy accustomed to being bathed, much easier to deal with a tiny squiggly puppy than 60 lbs of unruly dog later. With both of mine we'd just get them wet in the bathtub without using shampoo once a week for the first month or so. Different dogs take this differently depending on their personalities, my boy never liked it but always took it pretty well, my girl screamed like mad and scratched my arms trying to get out the first time we bathed her (she is fine with it now). 

- Train your puppy not be possessive over treats/toys, give him a treat that is very special and takes a while to chew, let your puppy chew it for a few minutes then come over and gently take it away. If your puppy growls at you, sternly tell him ""NO"" in a deep voice and put him in time out (we use a crate for this), after 10-15 mins try again. Did this with both of my dogs and now I can confidently take away even the most special treat from them without any possessiveness on their side. 

That's all I could think of to add :)"

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388719283.0,"&gt;It seems pretty clear you're using a Nietzsche-perspective of morality here. 

Correct.

&gt;Let me first start my stating clearly that I disagree entirely with his perspective on morality, but that wouldn't preclude me from discussing it with you.

Based on your comments, I'm not sure if you have a very firm understanding of Nietzsche's perspective.

&gt;[F]eminism, at its core, is about empowering women and enabling them to act without any societal gender constraints upon them.

I agree, and addressed that in my initial post.  Feminism is empowering **if** you are being oppressed.  However, if you are **not** being oppressed, if societal gender constraints are not what is preventing your from achieving your goals, then what does feminism offer?

Nothing.  Feminism is a reaction to patriarchy; remove patriarchy and what is feminism left with?  Tilting at windmills.  Attacking ghosts.  Picking fights with the past.

This is the fundamental problem.  Feminism is totally empowering in the face of an oppressive patriarchy that won't allow women to be anything but martyrs for women's liberation.  But the age of martyrs is long past, and societal gender constraints are illusory at best.

Feminism is a hammer for smashing patriarchy. But once patriarchy is smashed, then what?  Either you need new tools, or you just keep smashing that rubble until its powder.  And then keep smashing it some more.

Which is why we find campus feminists fighting to ban ""Blurred Lines,"" rather than doing something genuinely productive.  There is no more real constraint holding women back, not in the West.  There is only rubble, and even the rubble isn't worth smashing.  So instead, feminists engage in inanity like misrepresenting Thicke's song (which is pretty clearly an anti-slut shaming anthem) and taking one line entirely out of context (""I know you want it""), and presenting the entire song as a dire threat to women's safety.

&gt;To be an ""overman"" is to not only create the system that you want for yourself, but also having the power to impose that upon others. It's freeing yourself from the constraints of someone else's ideal and enacting your own vision upon the world.

No, being a *master* requires the power to impose your vision of the world on others.  The *Übermensch* requires no such power, for the only person the  Übermensch desires mastery over is himself (or herself).  The *Übermensch* is beyond master and slave morality.  The will to master others is a childish desire, while the will to master oneself is the heart of the Übermensch.  The Übermensch creates value, he does not *impose* value.

Feminism, as currently envisioned, is not a philosopy of the  Übermensch, but rather a philosophy of the [Last Men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_man).  

&gt;I disagree with how you define ""slave"" and ""master"" class. Even if you're correct that feminism lessens agency, it's important to distinguish for who- they lessen agency for male notions of what it means to be a woman in society. It's very goal is to demolish that perspective with their own values and morals about what it should mean to be a woman in society.

When I say that feminism reduces agency, what I mean is that feminism explains women's actions as resulting from social conditioning, and does not allow for the possibility that women are capable participants in their own destiny.  Feminism does not allow women to be the authors of their own destiny, rather it presents women as objects whom are acted upon by transpersonal forces.

By consistently presenting women as acted upon, rather than as actors, feminism strips women of their agency and reduces them to pawns, shuffled about on a game board by transpersonal forces beyond their control.  To even disagree with feminism is seen as proof of the exhortations of these forces; which is where we get the concept of ""internalized misogyny.""

&gt;In order for a person to engage with slave morality, they must inherently be restricting themselves. This is entirely the opposite of the feminist movement, which is about empowering women to rise above what society may expect from them.

Again, I see no evidence to support that claim.  Feminism is excellent at charting what society expects of women, and lambasting such expectations as unfair, but it offers women nothing to replace them with, except a perverse desire to become men and seize their position.

&gt;By definition, even if you don't like it, feminism could only be described as a master morality within a Nietzsche perspective, because it is specifically about overthrowing traditional notions of womanhood and instilling its own vision of womanhood upon society.

Actually, feminism offers no vision of womanhood to society, which is one of its many problems.  Again, this is because feminism can only function when women are oppressed.  Men must impose a vision of womanhood on women for feminism to have something to rail against, absent such an imposed vision, feminism offers nothing.  It can only turn on itself and eat its own; accusing anyone who would dare stepped forward with a new vision of womanhood -- the actual Überfrau -- of being an enemy of women.

Any woman who embraces master morality automatically makes herself a target of feminism, for by embracing the empowering aspects of the master morality, she becomes an enemy of feminist slave morality."

ernestborgnine2013,BodyAcceptance,1388719304.0,"Good advice, and what about this:
I am going out with someone tomorrow who talks about her diet all of the time. She lost weight too and is now quite thin, but she is always trying to keep her calories down to avoid gaining. I get annoyed with it because it's the same conversation every time and I would rather talk about anything else except calorie counting. She is always talking about being good (eating less/right) and being bad (overeating). She is my walking buddy so cutting her out of my life is not going to happen.

What irks me is that sometimes (just once in a while) we go out for lunch after our walks. If she is having a ""bad"" period, she will nearly greet me by saying she has been bad so she can't go out for lunch later. Regardless of whether I was asking her. 

I find it somewhat ""triggering"" (if that's the right word) in the sense that whatever she tells me she was eating on her bad day is usually pretty tame. When I hear what it was, I will reflect on whatever I ate the week before and start thinking of myself as bad too. So even though she is not putting me down, I end up coming away from the experience feeling ""bad"". 

It's a trickier one. I have asked her not to talk about dieting all the time, but she got really mad because now she has to censor herself. I maybe didn't express myself well.

papermageling,MakeupAddiction,1388719311.0,"I'd say the best things to start with, particularly for a very natural look, is a base makeup (foundation or tinted moisturizer or BB cream), blush, and mascara. 

Foundation is *hard*. I'd say a good starting point is looking at Revlon Colorstay (if I want to check the color of something from the drugstore, I usually go a Walmart, because someone has probably already been going through all of the makeup and trying it out, so I can test a product that no one will buy anyway, because the seal is broken. On a related note, check that your makeup hasn't already been messed with, particularly in stores where that seems to happen a lot). 

Another good option is mineral makeup. Powder sounds weird with dry skin, right? But if you use a decent moisturizing mineral primer (Physicians Formula has one), it's actually a good idea. In that case, I'd recommend [Meow Cosmetics](http://www.meowcosmetics.com/). Not the best website, but a rather amazing product. 

Target also often has testers for Boots makeup, which is actually very nice. So, you can see if you can get a colormatch with one of those. On that note, if you've got access to Boots cosmetics (sold at Boots in the UK, and Target in the US), try Boots No7 Exceptional Definition mascara. It's easily my favorite. Another good, easy mascara is Maybelline Full and Soft Washable. 

Oh, and you'll want some blush if you're wearing foundation. Pick up a color that looks pretty on you. I, once again, have a fondness for the Boots blush. NYX is also good, and I've got some I like from NYC and elf as well. 

Oh, and you might want some brushes. I'd recommend a spoolie for brushing through your lashes after mascara, to keep them clump free. You'll also want a blush brush, and maybe a powder brush or two. Good brush brands are elf (the studio line, which has the black handles), ecotools, Sonia Kashuk, and Real Techniques. "

It's more or less contradicted by something CR said during the last 24-hour livestream, though.  During that 24 hour livestream, CR said you can't get the game without a ship.  In the context of the question at the time, the implication was that once the game is released, the retail purchase will be the equivalent of the Aurora package.  It was reiterated since then that the Aurora ES is the starter ship.  However, since then, they've added the ability to buy character slots without a ship and gift them, and added another option for starter ship (Mustang), so precisely how this all plays out is a very open question.  But I assume the plan is still for the released game to work much like packages currently do: you pay your $59.99, and you get an Aurora ES or Mustang Starter or whatever with it.  With the added option of the Mustang, though, they may indeed go with the giving you the money to buy it yourself instead, so you can buy either.  Or maybe they sell two different retail packages.  Or maybe they give you a voucher to redeem for one or the other.  Or, during character creation, you choose as part of your backstory that you inherited one or the other from a late relative.

**Studies show that one's sex has little or no bearing on personality, cognition and leadership.**

*The Truth about Gender ""Differences""*

Mars-Venus sex differences appear to be as mythical as the Man in the Moon. 

A 2005 analysis of 46 meta-analyses that were conducted during the last two decades of the 20th century underscores that men and women are basically alike in terms of personality, cognitive ability and leadership. 

Psychologist Janet Shibley Hyde, PhD, of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, discovered that males and females from childhood to adulthood are more alike than different on most psychological variables, resulting in what she calls a gender similarities hypothesis. Using meta-analytical techniques that revolutionized the study of gender differences starting in the 1980s, she analyzed how prior research assessed the impact of gender on many psychological traits and abilities, including cognitive abilities, verbal and nonverbal communication, aggression, leadership, self-esteem, moral reasoning and motor behaviors.

Hyde observed that across the dozens of studies, consistent with the gender similarities hypothesis, gender differences had either no or a very small effect on most of the psychological variables examined. Only a few main differences appeared: Compared with women, men could throw farther, were more physically aggressive, masturbated more, and held more positive attitudes about sex in uncommitted relationships.

Furthermore, Hyde found that gender differences seem to depend on the context in which they were measured. In studies designed to eliminate gender norms, researchers demonstrated that gender roles and social context strongly determined a person's actions. For example, after participants in one experiment were told that they would not be identified as male or female, nor did they wear any identification, none conformed to stereotypes about their sex when given the chance to be aggressive. In fact, they did the opposite of what would be expected - women were more aggressive and men were more passive.

Finally, Hyde's 2005 report looked into the developmental course of possible gender differences - how any apparent gap may open or close over time. The analysis presented evidence that gender differences fluctuate with age, growing smaller or larger at different times in the life span. This fluctuation indicates again that any differences are not stable.

*Learning Gender-Difference Myths*

Media depictions of men and women as fundamentally ""different"" appear to perpetuate misconceptions - despite the lack of evidence. The resulting ""urban legends"" of gender difference can affect men and women at work and at home, as parents and as partners. 

As an example, workplace studies show that women who go against the caring, nurturing feminine stereotype may pay dearly for it when being hired or evaluated. And when it comes to personal relationships, best-selling books and popular magazines often claim that women and men don't get along because they communicate too differently. Hyde suggests instead that men and women stop talking prematurely because they have been led to believe that they can't change supposedly ""innate"" sex-based traits.

Hyde has observed that children also suffer the consequences of exaggerated claims of gender difference -- for example, the widespread belief that boys are better than girls in math. However, according to her meta-analysis, boys and girls perform equally well in math until high school, at which point boys do gain a small advantage. That may not reflect biology as much as social expectations, many psychologists believe. For example, the original Teen Talk Barbie ™, before she was pulled from the market after consumer protest, said, ""Math class is tough.""

As a result of stereotyped thinking, mathematically talented elementary-school girls may be overlooked by parents who have lower expectations for a daughter's success in math. Hyde cites prior research showing that parents' expectations of their children's success in math relate strongly to the children's self-confidence and performance.

*Moving Past Myth*

Hyde and her colleagues hope that people use the consistent evidence that males and females are basically alike to alleviate misunderstanding and correct unequal treatment. Hyde is far from alone in her observation that the clear misrepresentation of sex differences, given the lack of evidence, harms men and women of all ages. 

In a September 2005 press release on her research issued by the American Psychological Association (APA), she said, ""The claims [of gender difference] can hurt women's opportunities in the workplace, dissuade couples from trying to resolve conflict and communication problems and cause unnecessary obstacles that hurt children and adolescents' self-esteem.""

Psychologist Diane Halpern, PhD, a professor at Claremont College and past-president (2005) of the American Psychological Association, points out that even where there are patterns of cognitive differences between males and females, ""differences are not deficiencies."" She continues, ""Even when differences are found, we cannot conclude that they are immutable because the continuous interplay of biological and environmental influences can change the size and direction of the effects some time in the future.""
The differences that are supported by the evidence cause concern, she believes, because they are sometimes used to support prejudicial beliefs and discriminatory actions against girls and women. She suggests that anyone reading about gender differences consider whether the size of the differences are large enough to be meaningful, recognize that biological and environmental variables interact and influence one other, and remember that the conclusions that we accept today could change in the future.

&gt;There is no ""front"" because there is almost no place that combat can't be.
Since combat can happen anywhere, that means units that used to never see combat now see it regularly. For example, years ago MP units would almost never see combat. They would police the base and clear zones. In Afghanistan and Iraq they were engaged regularly, because there is no clear zone. Depending on the region, anywhere off base could be a potential ambush.


I am totally willing to admit my understanding of ""front"" was wrong. Nothing wrong with admitting when you're wrong. 


However the points you raised only solidify my belief that training and physical standards must not be lowered, since combat can happen anywhere.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388719510.0,"Conservative when he got into office, liberal now.

I think he's done an OKAY job, but not a great one. Certainly better than Bush. Here's the thing, it's easy to get caught up in the negative, but Obama has done a lot of good. He's actually reduced the deficit, althugh admittedly with poking and prodding from the GOP, he's done a lot of little things, from expanding unemployment to bailing out the financial sector to stop the economy from falling apart, etc. And this is stuff that he sometimes gets a lot of flak for, but I see them as necessities.

However, he's not perfect, and in a lot of ways, he's limits in what he can do. ACA is a mess, but that's because it was a compromise in order to get SOME healthcare passed. Bill Clinton tried to get healthcare 15 years before, and eventually got shut down by a republican majority. So he tried to pass SOMETHING so he can have some healthcare reform legacy, it's just not the change we needed. Likewise, he's been kinda deadlocked recently with republicans that has stopped him from enacting true liberal change. Everything is a freaking battle any more. He wants to do anything and he faces a rabid, ideological congress stopping him every step of the way. Honestly, considering how he's on the verge of being a lame duck, and pretty much has been a lame duck in some ways for years now, it's amazing he does what he does. The opposition and gridlock he faces from the GOP fanatics is just daunting. 

I do have to say he in spite of this, he needs more backbone. I can understand compromising the first time, but as the saying goes, first time, shame on you, second time, shame on me. He's kinda like that teacher in an unruly class who tried to talk the students into order with a calm voice and demeanor, but when the kids get more and more obnoxious, he doesn't step up. I respect his efforts for bipartisanship, I really do, but it's to the point it's lost all effectiveness. And this new budget bill he seems to have just sold the millions on unemployment out. 

And then there's the NSA thing, which I really DO place blame on him for. It's ridiculous. Bush was bad enough with this big brother crap, but Obama's just continued with this stuff and it's gotten worse. If there is anything I can say I am in plain disapproval of our president of, it's this. I can even forgive the mess of ACA for the reasons I mentioned earlier, it being a compromise and all. 

Foreign policy, I have no complaints, really. Diplomatic, but firm. SPeak softly, but carry a big stick. Even the drone thing, he does it because he doesnt wanna put our troops at risk, and despite the arguments against use, I can understand his motivations.

if I were gonna give the president a grade, I'd give him A- for effort (points deducted for NSA scandal), but a C+ performance. In comparison, I'd give Bush like a D-. So Obama is definitely an improvement, but he's not perfect.

Obviously I am for his stances on social issues too. "

He speaks pretty clearly about the dangers of adultery in several places, and [Matthew 5:27-28] makes it pretty clear that one can commit adultery in his heart simply by lusting after a woman. He doesn't limit it to married men or married women: merely lusting after a woman is enough.

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388719784.0,"&gt; Are these specifically attacking third-wave feminism? I think it's important to understand the distinction between the waves, and I would say that without the first and second waves women would not even be close to an equal playing field with men.

I think the concept of ""waves"" of feminism is fairly specious. The first wave of feminism were not feminists, the second wave of feminists were the actual feminists, and the so-called third wave of feminism is a giant mish-mash of nonsensical, often nutty ideas with no cohesion -- the inevitable result of the collapse of patriarchy and the loss of purpose to feminism.

Third wave feminism is like the intelligence community after the end of the Cold War.  Vast, powerful, and utterly without purpose, with no clear enemy, it turns on itself and begins to fester and rot.

&gt;It's really hard to respond to this to be honest, because you kind of assume feminism is just one big blob of a movement and every member is alike.

I'm not really interested in the No True Scotsman defense of feminism that is typically offered when feminism is criticized.  If you're uncomfortable talking about the movement as a whole, then this is probably not a conversation you will enjoy.

&gt;I honestly don't think that is a valid source of criticism of the movement as a whole. These represent only a few possibly mentally ill memebers of a huge cause with many sections to it.

Yes, you say that, but I have spent my entire life around feminists, have studied feminism extensively, know dozens and dozens of feminists personally, and took a host of women's studies classes in college, and I think Tumblr feminists are absolutely typical of feminists.  I often hear about feminists that aren't braindead nincompoops, but I've never actually met one.  They're as rare as unicorns, and I often suspect every bit as mythical."

luculentlady,relationship_advice,1388719809.0,"Okay here are my two cents.

The same situation happened with my husband and I. He signed up to join the Navy after we got married and got pregnant. I agreed to leaving my career behind since I just graduated college and be a stay at home mom and move around with him. We lived on base in South Carolina and he started having these weird days where he'd go to work and come home and lock himself up in the computer room. We were young and didn't do everything right, for example, I didn't know how to be a good 'house wife' because I didn't really grow up in a good home..anyways, the kitchen was sometimes messy, I didn't have good cleaning habits and I hated doing laundry....that was the one chore I hated but it apparently drove him crazy so he would hide in his computer room and play games as soon as he came back from work.

I talked to people online and they advised me to try playing these games with him as a way to reconnect with him...so I tried playing WoW with him but he'd always leave me behind to go play with his brother so I got tired of chasing my own husband in a damned game. I started playing my own games instead and our nights would go on like that until he happened to want sex or I came onto him then it wasn't games that night. 

Anyways! I got deeper and deeper into these online text adventure games and made a male friend whom I started talking to more about my marriage but I was too paranoid because I didn't want him to identify me in anyway to reach my husband so I lied about my identity, denied I had a son and just said I was a normal 'mid twenty' woman with marital problems.  He too was depressed because of something that was going on in his life but he never wanted to get too personal or share anything with me, he just listened. 

My husband came home one night and I was playing the text adventure game in an adult setting, it was a sex scene that I was being persuaded to write about. I got flustered and just closed my laptop and he got suspicious but I just let it go.

He started investigating and I was really worried that he would get angry with me....I'm normally not a lying person but I was so terrified of him leaving me that I flat out lied to him and tried to hide the friendship with this guy but when he caught me in the lie I agreed to all his terms and broke off all contact with this guy. I even got online and chatted with the guy and told him that I can't be his friend anymore because my husband is more important to me and that really was the last time I ever heard or contacted the guy.

From this point on, my husband became too paranoid to ever trust me again and we haven't recovered because I didn't put in the right effort to fix it. 

Today, however, someone pointed me to Mort Fertel and I got his book about Marriage Fitness, I bought his audio cd's and I'm doing EVERYTHING to win my husband's heart back because I realized that I just can't live without him...and I realized this too late when he is having an affair :(

But, I'm hopeful that everything I'm doing will eventually break through if I stay the course and show him that I'm committed to our marriage and commited to fixing everything I broke.

I hope this gives you a little perspective, she sounds like me, she's lying because she's scared. Give her a little reassurance that she doesn't need to lie to you and that you won't be angry with her if she'd just come clean and really work to earn your trust back. Sometimes, women just need to be told what makes it better for you.

I hope she wakes up soon enough and realizes what she's ruining.

Good luck!"

GetOffMyLawn_,EatCheapAndHealthy,1388719911.0,"I have the same exact problem, which is why I became macrobiotic for years.  (Originally the diet was very anti-fruit). You can get by without fruit, just eat more veggies. I can't eat oranges, I don't even like to be in the room with them, but I can deal with lemon juice and occasionally lime juice. There are fresh veggies that have vitamin C, like green or red bell peppers. You can't eat peaches but you can eat mangos, judging by the color (which can be an indicator or nutrients) that's a good substitute. If sweet taste is what you are looking for then starchy vegetables (winter squash, corn, etc...) tend to be sweeter if cooked long enough. You can get sweet onions (vidalia) to get some more sweetness.

Do try other fruits when they are in season. I can't touch strawberries but I can eat raspberries and blueberries by the bushel. And blackberries. I only get them in summer when they are on sale. Cherries are also good, probably because they only come around once a year and I don't build up a sensitivity to them. 

You can get canned fruit packed in light syrup or juice, although the latter taste bitter to me. You could try rinsing them before eating them to get rid of some of the sugar.

Technically tomatoes and cucumbers are fruit, I eat those every day. 

My supermarket often has containers of cut up fruit like pineapple, so if getting a whole pineapple and cutting it up is a barrier you can get fresh if you want. Although this tends to be expensive. And I am allergic to pineapple so this doesn't work for me. Fresh pineapple is fantastic, and once in a while I do accidentally eat pineapple without having a major reaction, but I avoid it whenever possible.

Very often cooking a food changes it enough so that I don't have a reaction to it, although I am not a big fan of cooked fruit. So applesauce is pretty safe whereas raw apples are iffy. Also with apples I find that I am allergic to certain kinds but not others. I could eat macs but not red delicious, golden delicious are safe. So try different varieties and see if one kind is better than another. "

She still went to church, and we would have discussions about our beliefs, but didn't let it drive us apart as I think it was interesting to both of us. After two years she was having issues with her faith and started going with a group of students to a bible study at some woman's house. Next thing you know she is starting to practice in a fundamentalist manner. She completely changed, it drove a wedge between us and she broke up with me for not believing in god.

Date another girl that was raised Catholic but not actively practicing. The only time she really mentioned religion to me was that she went home and her mother had hung a cross over her bed and how uncomfortable it made her feel. After 3 years she broke up with me, saying she wanted to raise her kids Catholic. I think there was more to it than that, but we pretty much cut contact immediately so who knows.

Neither relationship was necessarily a healthy, happy relationship, so its for the best they ended, but I don't think I want to commit another 3 years of my life to someone that will reject me for religious differences.

I can't tell the future for said person, but aside from the hobo and where he got his car I was talking from a group standpoint of firstly all people who drive cars, and secondly all people in society. If a majority (even a small one) of the people in a society were a net loss to that society wouldn't that society move backwards and decline? Do you truly believe that more people are being a net burden on society than the opposite? It is a rather big hypothesis, and there is no real way to quantify monetary value on ones impact on society as far as I know. So yes, it is a hypothesis... well more of a musing exactly, not really being serious just offering a different perspective.


In the individual case of the hobo then it would be a net gain that is true. And I suppose that someone close to pension or on pension would also be a net gain, since the cost of pension is supposed to be earned during the lifetime but will befall the government if they die early. This is also cold blooded speculation though... and I really should sleep right now."

derleth,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1388720054.0,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Birch_Society

&gt; The society was established in Indianapolis, Indiana, on December 9, 1958, by a group of 12 led by Robert Welch, Jr., a retired candy manufacturer from Belmont, Massachusetts. [snip] Fred Koch, founder of Koch Industries, was one of the founding members.

You may know the Koch Brothers from their support of the modern Libertarian Movement and, in particular, the Cato Institute.

&gt; The society opposed aspects of the 1960s civil rights movement and claimed the movement had communists in important positions. In the latter half of 1965, the JBS produced a flyer entitled ""What's Wrong With Civil Rights?"", which was used as a newspaper advertisement.[15][16] In the piece, one of the answers was: ""For the civil rights movement in the United States, with all of its growing agitation and riots and bitterness, and insidious steps towards the appearance of a civil war, has not been infiltrated by the Communists, as you now frequently hear. It has been deliberately and almost wholly created by the Communists patiently building up to this present stage for more than forty years.""[17] The society opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, claiming it violated the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and overstepped individual states' rights to enact laws regarding civil rights. The society opposes ""one world government"", and it has an immigration reduction view on immigration reform. It opposes the United Nations, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), and other free trade agreements.

Here's where they go a bit more nuts:

&gt; Welch wrote in a widely circulated statement, The Politician, ""Could Eisenhower really be simply a smart politician, entirely without principles and hungry for glory, who is only the tool of the Communists? The answer is yes."" He went on. ""With regard to ... Eisenhower, it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason.""

That's right: Ike's a pinko Commie-symp with a Red hand up his ass.

The GOP, lead by Buckley and Goldwater, kicked them out for that. It's hard to imagine the current GOP doing the same to the modern equivalents in the Libertarian and Tea Party Movements. Too many votes would be on the line for something as silly as principle."

I admit, both parties do have problems. But after watching all this tea party crap in recent years, this scares me. It scared me so much it scared me right out of conservatism. Seriously. The democrats might only be worthy of a C, if I were to grade them, but to me, the GOP is a big fat F.

Reaching out and grabbing that tree because you have heard somewhere that according to Physics, that tree might save your life is just as reasonable as praying to a God that you have heard might save your life.

If you're not already, you might consider focusing manually and either picking a spot in the water to focus on where you'll take your pictures as she swims by, or, before she swims, practice adjusting the focus on the water or lane separators so you can track her on the fly (harder but will yield more photos). And on that note, if focusing manually and dynamically, I'd watch the lane separator shes' next to, not her, to adjust the focus on her. It'll be way easier to tell whether it's in focus than she will.

Reason I ask is, a few months ago I was pooping out these thingies that looked similar. Took a few in a baggie to the urgent care. Dr said he's never heard of any parasites or worms that live in our body that are brown. He didn't run any test on the things, because he said he would've need my poop to test, and I only brought in the worms so as not to be too gross lol. The only idea he could come up with was that sometimes if you eat fruits/vegetables the fibers can kind of string themselves together into a worm looking thing. So, if it is a bug thing, it probly didn't come out of your wife. And if it did come out of Wifey, it's probly not a bug thing, just a fiber strandy mucus thing. That's what mine were anyway. Did you touch it much? Was it kinda firm? Cuz mine were like...formed, shaped, snot? I guess you would say. The things would snap apart if you kind of pulled on them.

But the official ending is still better than ""Batman beats Darkseid"" in one very important way: it gives the victory to someone who the audience genuinely wouldn't have expected to beat Darkseid. Batman was, quite literally, the most used character on the show. Most episodes appeared in, most problems figured out, etc. Giving him the win would have been more of the same.

At least having the biggest bad of the series eliminated by the second biggest bad was unexpected. Yes, it still was anticlimactic as all heck, but Batman winning would have been anticlimactic *and* overused."

Are you sure?  Because from what I've heard, women are the ones paranoid about the money in a relationship when they have the higher incomes.  I've heard a number of times that they aren't willing to throw down cash for dinners/drinks/much-of-anything inside a relationship when they're earning 2-5x as much as the man.  And they're hyper-sensitive to the fact.  I went to a weird dating thing discussion thing once and a number of men and women backed this up.  Men are willing to pay for sex inside or outside a relationship, women are hyper-sensitive/paranoid about it.

You have to register a trademark, and it only affects usage in trade, not publication. Watch this: 747, 747, 747.

&gt;  I also believe you can also copyright a number as I seem to recall the MPAA enforcing their copyright on decryption keys.

I think you're thinking of the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions. Either way, decryption keys are usually longer than ten digits. Copyrights require originality, and they are awarded to their authors. You were not the author of your phone number, and there was no originality in the way they were assigned--it was quite arbitrary and meaningless, derived by following federal rules and avoiding numbers already registered.

I encourage you to file for a trademark on or register a copyright for your phone number. You'll pay the full application fee, but only waste a few minutes of the lucky government employee's time.

&gt; They scraped the entire database. Do you think all they have are usernames and numbers?

Yes. Those links were accessible because all they had  to do was put in a phone number, and they'd get the username, because that's how Snapchat works--that's how you find your friends. That's *not* to get the pictures, and I've yet to hear of a way they could, let alone any hint that they did."

Also, for my first couple of quilts I needed to put a line of tape on my machine so that I made sure my 1/4"" seams were actually 1/4"". There's no shame in that. Do what you need to do! 

As for slowing down: I actually found that doing the actual quilting was easier for me to relax and handle patiently if I was listening to classical music. When I'm cutting and piecing, I can listen to anything - but classical music made the magic happen for me.

Again, welcome and we're all looking forward to seeing more!"

I suspect you'd see a marked decrease in insecurity, and, ironically, when people did eventually couple off (because some would for companionship, even without so much all-consuming social pressure) there wouldn't be so much jealousy immaturity because of the prior focus on personal development.

So, to answer your question, it's because they get paid for OTA broadcasts as well.  The difference is that the cable carriage contracts were negotiated with OTA in mind which likely isn't true for internet streaming (ie the contract might say something about not competing with cable)."

To give a different opinion on the colors: I like them, particularly the orange-white of the lighthouse contrasted against the blue-gray of the clouds. It makes the lighthouse feel like it's looking out at an off-camera sunset.

And it's true: there are only so many ways to shoot a lighthouse. But it's also ok to take photos that look like other photos. Experiment and see what you like (your opinion is ultimately the most important)."

AUG is fine, it is already a weaker and vastly more expensive AK that doesn't particularly need a nerf.

The SG is in my not humble opinion, the best weapon in the game. The reason why the recoil pattern is ""complete shit"" is because it is the most accurate weapon in the game, accurate enough and damaging enough to reliably one shot headshot at pretty much any range. You can remove the scope and its still better than the AK. One click heads and outpeek AWPers all day long.

Once you've done this, you can skate them for awhile, I usually clean them around once a month, or when the shields look dirty enough to be cleaned, or if they start making weird sounds like there is grit trapped in the bearings.

The space between your ball bearings and the inner / outer race is very small, smaller than a human hair, and a little bit of dirt in there can slow down your bearing, which slows down your wheel, which slows your whole board down. 

New bearings are clean, and they sound clean for awhile.  You will notice a different sound, a bit louder, like grit is trapped in there or something.  

If your cleaning them make sure you have some lubricant like bones speed cream otherwise they won't spin properly and will break without lubrication, possibly exploding into pieces from the friction. "

stefaniey,AskReddit,1388721730.0,"My god this thread has made me so grateful for my current friends. 

But if you want a story, here we go. 

I had a brief interlude with a bipolar pathological liar in early high school, took a while to recover from that. On the outside; picture of confidence, unemotional etc. Inside: everyone hates me and they're all lying about being my friend. 

At 16 I moved to my current city and met some amazing girls. Up until 2013, we were all pretty close. We'd had the usual drift but still got together every couple of months or made special plans to do things together. This covered an interstate move for me, several visits from a few group members and a warm welcome on my return. 

In 2013, shit got weird. In high school, there was myself, Sarah and Gabby. Sarah and I bonded really quickly and are still best friends. Sarah and Gabby were together from age 8 and became close friends just before I arrived. So for high school and the following few years, we hung out a lot, had a great time. 

Gabby decided she was having a quarter life crisis. Gabby was always talking about work drama, home drama, life drama. We helped her deal, but didn't notice the lack of return. After a while, we noticed; we'd hang out and it was all about her. No questions about us, or anything. She hated my new boyfriend; she even said she had nothing against him, he was a lovely person and clearly good for me. But I wasn't ready to be in a relationship (because I am incapable of making decisions for myself. For context; it was 6 months after the end of my last relationship and I eased myself into this relationship. Still going, still happy.)

She hated Sarah's boyfriend. Never a nice thing to say. On Gabby's birthday, she was moody, so several friends tried to comfort her. On one occasion, one of Gabby's newer friends told an older friend that ""she hadn't really been there for Gabby, so maybe she should just leave."" Patently untrue and evidence that Gabby had been telling lies to new friends to fit her world view. She decided she was mad at a lot of us but when we asked what we had done, couldn't tell us. ""Nothing's wrong, everything's fine"" and then buttloads of passive aggression. 

She cuts most of us off, says she is going to find herself. Hangs out with known unsavoury characters, including Sarah's manipulative, psychotic ex boyfriend. Never apologizes for anything she's said when she gets back in touch with us. 

Sarah and I decided to just let it go, we were angry for a while, worked through it and began enjoying drama free lives. Someone asked if I missed Gabby. I miss who she was two years ago; fun, loving, friendly, thoughtful. Not who she is now. "

It affected my nephew and one of my neighbors. Urination gets so painful that the boy avoids it, leading to infections and/or kidney damage.

The remedy is to slice the meatus (urethral opening) open with a scalpel and let the hot urine foster more scar tissue.

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388721862.0,"&gt;So this summary of feminist philosophy (and thus feminist epistemology), as it compares to other types of ethics in the link, is saying that feminism is mainly concerned with representing the experience of a marginalized group and gaining appearance for that perspective because currently the common perspective used to evaluate marginalization isn't the perspective of the marginalized group. 

Yes, that seems fair.  My contention is that women are not, in fact, a marginalized group in any meaningful sense, which is why feminists often manage to make themselves look really dumb by trying to convince people that pop songs and children toys are oppressing them.

if you see yourself as marginalized, but you're actually in a position of privilege, then you quickly become a douchebag.  You can see the same thing happen with evangelical Christians who have convinced themselves that Christianity is a persecuted and marginalized religion in America.

&gt;This means when you say that feminist philosophy is creating a perspective of victimization you could reliably be said not to be speaking from the perspective of a marginalized group.

Or I could be speaking from the position of a person who has experienced real marginalization, and recognizes that these feminists are actually speaking from an extremely privileged position.

But honestly I'm not even sure what you just said there.  It seems like you're saying the victimization of women is only visible from the perspective of the victimized, and thus the fact that I disagree with their claim to be victimized is proof that I am not part of their marginalized group.

And while that's an interesting (and very circular) argument, I find it rather facile, as the exact same argument could be made about evangelical Christians who perceive a war on Christmas occurring in America.

&gt;Slut walks are about changing the way people treat rape. It's a very not silly way to clearly make the point (while organizing which is any groups right) that the way a woman dresses does not mean anything about rape except for a culture that is trying to find ways to excuse rape rather than educate people not to commit vicious crimes or support their friends committing vicious crimes.

Yeah, there's just one slight problem with that.  Namely, the suggestion that the attitude that how women dress causes rape is actually widespread and commonplace, or that such attitudes are a serious contributing factor to rape and sexual assault.  

I have heard this idea from many, many feminists, but I've never actually seen anyone actually make the argument...except the one Toronto police officer whose off the cuff comment -- in direct violation of his department's policy -- inspired the Slut Walks.  

Let's stop and think about that for a second.  Some **cop** -- not a police chief, not a mayor, not an elected official, but literally some dude whose only qualification is a high school diploma and some on-the-job training -- this *dumbass* says something dumb, and then Slut Walks happen.

I've never encountered anyone whose opinions on rape were actually changed by Slut Walks, nor can I find any evidence that they have had any real effect.  I have met plenty of guys who used Slut Walks as an opportunity to ogle women.  If the the goal was the pornification of protest, mission successful.  If it was anything else, I'd have to count it as a failure.  But mostly, it appears to be a case of tilting at windmills.

It's truly sad that this is the most successful feminist campaign in decades.

&gt;Censorship campaigns, in the case of the one you've referenced, are about not having naked women being chased around by a guy with the words ""you know you want it"" being said over the image on television. 

The video (conceived and directed by a women, btw) does not broadcast over the radio, so the notion that the song is being banned from college radios due to the video is specious at best.  So then it comes down to one line, stripped of context.  Do you know why Robin Thicke knows she wants it?  Because she keeps grabbing at him.  And you know why he's telling her he knows she wants it?  Because he's inviting her to ""come get it.""

The song is literally a man telling a woman she doesn't have to play coy, and that he knows she wants to have sex with him, and that its okay for her to be straightforward about it.  It is utterly ludicrous to suggest that the song is about rape in any sense.

The suggestion that women are somehow endangered by Robin Thicke singing about how women have sexual desires and shouldn't be ashamed to act on them is **beyond** ridiculous.  It's fucking *laughable*.

&gt;So all of that being said now, either your take on feminism is incorrect regarding victimhood and what the point of feminism actually is, or your take on victimhood and what's wrong or actually occurring with you think the way people have taken to be activists regarding feminist issues is incorrect.

Or your argument is nonsensical.  That possibility remains."

One thing you find in common with all the great teams that play through the middle is a great CM or two coupled with a creative mid. It seems to me like that really showed up against Bayer with Giggs and Kagawa, while the rest of the time the combination of Cleverly and Carrick doesn't seem to click (not detracting from their individual ability). Formation or personnel, it seems to me that the wings tactics is less cause and more effect of not being able to get up the middle."

stayclose,breakingbad,1388721921.0,"welp. here it goes. the show is about a 'normal guy' becoming a terrible person. by the end of the show, walt is the villain. it tries to be fairly realistic in depicting corruption in that, when walt does awful things, they don't always work the way he wants them to and while he may gain power or money or both, he often loses something even more valuable. [often, the trust or respect of his comrades or family.]

basically, the show is about a man who, in trying to live ends up destroying everyone else around him.

but! you wouldn't know it based of what the ending presents to us. in ozymandias [the best episode, not arguable] the cumulative damage that walt set in motion from the very first episode, finally begins to bite him in his ass. he's caught. he loses his brother in law. he loses jesse. and it's all his fault. because of his greed, ego, pride.

of course, walt isn't stupid. he runs, he's never going to relent. he's never going to do the right thing. he's going to try to win until he can't anymore.

and that's the way i believe the show *should* have ended. granite state was fine, but when the nazi's got to marie's house, his family should have been there, and they should have killed them all. walt, having nothing left to lose, comes out of hiding. not to save jesse, or give a bunch of money to his family that they don't want anyway [which, i believe is an extremely pompous and dick move]. but to get his money and property. [jesse.] walt kills all the nazi's but also kills jesse in the process. he loses everything and is left in the desert with nothing but his money and his shame.

vg, in and [interview with entertainment weekly](http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/09/30/breaking-bad-finale-vince-gilligan/), said that they kicked this idea around, but basically says it would have been too hard on the viewers. this was the ending i called at the height of the conversation, and to me, the 'right' ending. and i think it's bullshit that vg and crew felt like they had to give us some fluffy 'walt dies on his own terms with some modicum of goodness and redemption with his first and only love.' 

they should have stuck to their guns and kicked us in the fucking teeth. this felt like pussyfooting and the more i think about it, the more i dislike it. anyway, just my opinion. but i've never heard a good argument against what i'm saying. i'd love to hear one. :)"

I don't use condoms with my current partner because I hate them and they give me yeast/bv infections EVERYTIME without fail. I use an IUD, he doesn't cum in me, and we've agreed to go halvsies on the abortion if for some reason the IUD fails. If she doesn't have sensitivities like I do, and wants to keep a potential pregnancy, she needs to be using spermicide, diaphrams, and birth control.

CosmicCam,SteamGameSwap,1388722224.0,"True, but would that price be an outlier or the norm?

And while the past price does affect things on current price. You go on what's current, not in what was.

Maybe a better example would be a car. When a car first comes out, the price is fairly moderate. But 15 years down the road, that same price would be unfair. If you wanted to purchase/sell that car, you would do for much cheaper due to the current auto market, not on what it was a few years ago. Will you find price fluctuations, yes.

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388722329.0,"“Memory says, 'I did that.' Pride replies, 'I could not have done that.' Eventually, memory yields.”  - Nietzsche

My assumption is that many rapes and sexual assaults go unreported because the victim knows on some level that she is responsible for her behavior, and yet is unable or unwilling to admit that to herself.  It is easier to see herself as a victim of male aggression, that to admit she turns into a sex-crazed slutbomb when she gets a few drinks in her.

Pride tells her that she's a good girl, memory contradicts, and so memory is changed to absolve her of responsibility.  Thus she goes to a party, she gets drunk, she gets turned on by some meathead, lets him slobber all over her, and in the morning she convinces herself that she could never have been that person, so he must have forced himself on her.

I base this on the large number of stories of unreported rapes I've heard.  Most of which conform to this general model."

Just_Observational,AskReddit,1388722383.0,"Absolutely. And I'm just pointing out mostly that nobody should jump to conclusions on the matter at all.

Making it legal to put a girl who hasn't been able to prove it enough in prison isn't the answer either though. That deters rape victims from coming forward, seriously. I was mostly saying that tongue in cheek to point out the ridiculousness of the original point.

Edit: It wasn't entirely non serious just some of it was over the top. Like how do you define 'questionable' in the first place? And what about those who were made to sit and take it AND the guy wore a condom? Of course there's cases where the logic I put forth doesn't apply at all! I kinda wrote it that way.

I actually shouldn't speak on the specifics of evidence for rape cases because I'm in no way qualified to, I know Reddit by in large doesn't believe in this mentality, but I can speak on the fact that if a friend of mine was raped and her raper got away, I wouldn't want her to go to prison and for that to deter future women from coming forward.

My major's curriculum makes us start French and Italian at the same time and 30 out of 50 people managed to not only learn well the basics of both of them, but continue studying the two languages (the major requires to choose one, but there are extracurricular classes at the uni). The romance languages have one big ancestor in common: Latin, which happens to be root for English as well. And although Spanish and French are the most separated languages in the family, they are still good sisters that can be treated in a similar way to get the same result. In other words, your techniques for one will work pretty well for the other, putting apart pronunciation (French is one weird language where not everything is pronounced) and accentuation (Spanish has three very simple rules, while French uses four accents to express both phonetics and intonation). As long as you feel confident enough that you can mater both, you will. And if it fails, you can always leave one and continue it later."

What I consider basic knowledge:

1)  Can you use outlook?  Do you know how to create appointments, tasks, ect, and add an email signature?  If not, then they don't know how to use outlook.  Learn it.

2) Are they confident enough to use a computer without thinking they are going to break it?

3) Do they know the difference between a good email and a suspicious email?  

4) Do they know how to type with more than 2 fingers?

5) Can they create desktop shortcuts, bookmarks, and know how to use windows?

bombeater,SF4,1388722938.0,"The problem you're having is that at a very fundamental level, you and your friends play the game for different reasons.

The kind of people who subscribe to subreddits like this play fighting games *primarily* for the challenge and competition, and only secondarily for fun.

But when people first sit down with a fighting game, even if they eventually take it up as a skill, they are playing it *primarily* for the fun, and only secondarily for the challenge.

So even if you try to tone it down, you're still lightyears ahead of anyone who doesn't know the basics.

*However*, it's still entirely possible to have fun playing competitive games that you're great at with friends who are noobs. Follow these simple steps:

1. Swallow your pride and acknowledge that it's more fun to lose a few games that you ""should have"" won because you were holding back
2. Swallow your pride even more and acknowledge that it's worth having fun with your buddies even though some of them will be sore winners who say ""Haha, see man, you're like some kind of expert but I rocked your face off without even trying."" Just smile quietly and agree when this happens. Remember: you are very likely on an entirely different level from your buddies.
3. Choose one or more characters that you are unlikely to play competitively. These are now your designated characters for masking your power level. (If you pick your usual characters, you risk damaging your healthy competitive muscle memory patterns with the toned-down ones.)
4. Mask your power level. **WITHOUT MENTIONING ANYTHING TO YOUR FRIENDS**, choose strategic handicaps and restrictions for yourself. For example:
 * Only jump-ins.
 * No jumping, ever.
 * If it ain't broke, fix it: as soon as you do something that works twice in a row (two jump-ins, two whiff punishes, two empty jump wakeup throws), you're not allowed to do it again for the rest of the match. Challenge yourself by trying to draw from a dwindling list of options.
 * No ""technical"" combos: 1-frame links, FADC cancels, etc.
 * The Subtle Throw: make every match incredibly close, then try to predict exactly what kind of ""mistake"" you can make that, based on your friend's patterns, you can rely on them to capitalize in a dramatic way.

 Those are just a few examples. You can come up with dozens more. If you're doing it right, *no one will know* that you're masking your power level, they'll feel like the matches are really close, and as you get better at playing this way, you'll also get better at ""playing pedagogically"". In other words, if you get really good at limiting yourself, you can curate fun matches that subtly force your friends to get better just by playing you.
5. Mix trash talk with teaching. Suppose you decide to play a game where you restrict yourself to only blocking, dashing, and jumping for the first 15 seconds of the match. If your friend says ""DUDE, stop *BLOCKING* so much. It's so fucking cheap!"" you can shoot back, ""You  don't want me to block then throw me! I'm not stoppin you."" You want it to be trashtalk-y enough to sound casual, but with nuggets of truth hidden within.

There are some fundamentals about each game that make competitive players invincible to newbies; in SF4, high-tech BnB combos (think C. Viper), cross-ups and vortexes, blockstrings, and option selects are the biggest tools that *casual players couldn't possibly figure out by themselves*, so if you want to try playing on their level, restrict yourself from using these tools on an individual basis and see if you can still capitalize on mistakes, punish whiffs, and have fun with your buddies."

diadelsuerte,nfl,1388723108.0,"We are now approximately 3 quarters into the Sugar Bowl, and Alabama has yet to run one single zone or stretch play, FYI - do you watch them often, or did they just change their entire offensive scheme for a single  BCS bowl?

EDIT:  I see now that you are talking about the inside zone, got my wires crossed here.  I had just assumed you were talking about the outside stretch aka what most football-types mean when they say 'zone.'  

But even so, I think it's a huge jump to say an inside zone scheme is different enough from a dive/power/iso scheme as to explain a huge drop in production.  I totally get where you are coming from, but I don't think I'd reach exactly the same conclusion on a guy like Trent Richardson.  Just does not have the top end speed or instincts needed to get to the second level in the NFL, among other things.  If anything, playing in a dive/power/iso scheme, rather than an inside (or outside) zone scheme would help a guy like that, rather than hinder him.  You aren't losing a step on a cutback waiting for the guards to get to the second level or losing a step trying to see if a 3 technique DT gets combo'ed or fold'ed.  Interesting and thoughtful analysis, but I'd just disagree on it being as clear-cut as you presented it."

That they are greedy sons of bitches who can't be bothered to pay back into the system that benefits them only illustrates that they are selfish, amoral, and lazy bums happy to steal other people's money.

Liberals are under no obligation to let right-wingers get away with that, and refusing to be suckers and pay the bills for rich right-wingers doesn't, in any way, indicate they aren't serious about helping the poor.

Cirie because she would be regarded about as highly as Parvati is which is pretty damn high. She is the most heads up player I've ever seen, but manages to downplay her rampant paranoia such that no one notices. She sees through everyone's personality to what their role is in the game, so she knows who needs to go when. That's a long way of saying that her game sense is incredible. Also she's hilarious. If she ever makes it near a FTC she will win unanimously. 

Basically I just love Cirie and really wish she was a winner. If she was I think she'd be considered a Top 5 player. 

edit: rampant paranoia might not be quite accurate, but she's paranoid in a good way. She knows others are playing the game and tries to stay one step ahead. She executes the ""think about what every other player's best move is, and assume they will make it"" strategy perfectly. "

I don't really downvote anyone unless they're obviously detracting from the conversation and you were no exception, because you weren't trolling or trying to incite anyone (well I mean you're guilty of the second but I still don't really downvote people :').) I wasn't going indepth for my previous response but I'll go indepth now for you.

First off, you're a pedant. There's no two ways about it, you pulled apart a casual response and took every word to exact meaning while missing the point: it's a silly joke, but not a racist one. 

You took it as more than it was because you're personally offended due to your nationality. I can definitely understand the feeling of not thinking something is funny because it's directed at me or a group I'm part of, it's human.

You're looking at my post as a formal argument so you've put on blinders. Sure, viruses like conflicker might not happen everyday, but they do happen often. No they're not a majority of all viruses but they're in the mix and people remember where they've originated. I've never gotten an email from a Nigerian prince, but I associated Nigerian royalty with fraud. It's the same idea.

Another result of your blinders is taking my spelling mistakes at face value. Did I say 'fun'  and mean 'run'? Yes. Did I say 'lens' and mean 'lends'? Yes. Phones aren't the pinnacle of typing technology and you'll have to forgive humanity for mistakes anyway.

You've also ignored the context for some reason. While you didn't specifically highlight supposed racism, stereotyping, prejudice, and racism go hand in hand. I mentioned that no one would be wary (spelling mistake in my original post, you'll have to forgive me) of croatians because you replied to YawnDogg's post about distrusting croatians.

Overall, you're a very hostile person, usually I wouldn't respond to anyone like you, but I'm feeling good today and your brash attitude can't change it. Maybe you should follow the mantra ""don't be an asshole."" I mean you may have had some point in your post, and you may have even gotten people to acknowledge it, but by being an asshole you've invalidated your point of view to most others. 

You can respond if you like, but unless you're not what you've already shown yourself capable to be (an asshole,) I won't respond.

See, the thing you have to understand is that the house is a multi-dimensional entity. It exist on several planes. In our plane, it's a book. Inside of that book, it's a manuscript that eventually becomes a book. Inside of that book, it's a movie. Inside of that movie, it's the House we know and love. And inside of that House is *our world's book.* So solving the mystery is out. He would have to obtain that universes equivalent of TES's CHIM. Bats is smart, but not that smart.

Which brings me to my next point. House of Leaves is a lot of things, but it actually isn't purely a fear-inspiring thing per se. According to *Revolutionary Leaves: the Fiction of Mark Z. Danielewski,* a character stays in the House for as long as they indulge in their negative emotions. It's classic katabasis, and you can only truly escape through spiritual catharsis.

And what's the one thing that our good batsy friend will never, ever have? Catharsis, bitches. Sure, he might physically escape. But he'd come back. And back. And back. And eventually, he'd be swallowed by the House because deep down inside he's still an insane little boy that never got over his parents death.

While what we know today as England was forming, it suffered several invasions, each providing cultural influence. Though the most important was Germanic, there were also invasions from cultures that spoke variations of French. Centuries later, when the first English Grammar was being written, it was pointed out the similitude of some terms with Latin, and it was resolved to adjust the spelling to make it fit with it, turning for example the word ""receit"" into ""receipt"" to resemble the Latin word Receptus. That is what makes Latin a root of English. It is not the main root, though, a position corresponding to Germanic, but is one of the most influential to its modern form."

So he already came in with us knowing he might take a year or two.    Then remember during training camp [his mother died](http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/cowboys/post/_/id/4712448/j-j-wilcoxs-mother-passes-away).

danhakimi,Android,1388723814.0,"No, you couldn't, and even if you could, you still wouldn't be able to copyright the numbers.

What you're talking about is a compilation. A compilation is a collection of other works, copyrightable or not. The compilation istelf can be copyrightable if there is originality in the arrangement or selection--but not if it's ""just a random ... collection of 10 digit numbers.""

If you don't believe me, go read [Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Co.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_v._Rural). The short version: Feist might have copied a significant chunk of Rural's collection of phone numbers, but Rural's collection was not copyrightable, because it was just a bunch of phone numbers listed in a way dictated by function and not really original in any way. It didn't even matter that four of the numbers Feist copied from Rural were actually typos, and thus entirely unique to Rural's phone books: there was just nothing copyrightable in anything that Rural had.

Likewise, if you think of snapchat's database as a phone book, even the combination of the usernames and the numbers to which they're attached is uncopyrightable, let alone the numbers alone, or even one of the numbers.

I'd try it again the same way, taking all the shots from the same place. But I'd move things around on the table between shots and reposition your legs as though you're sitting there drinking. In order to move around freely while also being in the shot, I'd suggest putting the camera on a tripod immediately behind where you're sitting, if that's possible.

I'd order the presentation of the shots so they get progressively blurrier. They **don't** need to be in *depth-of-field* order in their final presentation, though I would order them from clearest to least clear.

papermageling,MakeupAddiction,1388724069.0,"Foundation (and/or other base makeup) plus mascara, and if you like, some lipgloss, is most certainly an excellent place to start. You'll look like you, just a bit prettier and more awake. 

When you want to start with eyemakeup, certainly look at tutorials (Lisa Eldridge and Goss Makeupartist are both great). I'd recommend starting by contouring a bit with a lightish matte brown. It'll open up your eyes a bit without looking obviously makeupy. Do get a primer though. I like the NYX HD one. 

For filling in your brows, get a matte powder (I use a matte eyeshadow from NYX) that's close in color to to your brows if you kind of zoomed out. So, not the color of the hair, but the color of the overall brow, counting shadows and skin showing through. Make sense? You want something a bit darker than that, and brush that through your brows. You'll end up with something very soft and natural looking, but a bit more prominent than before. "

frsp,AskReddit,1388724120.0,"Abortion.

It literally does not matter what mental gymnastics you use to justify it, dismembering an unborn child is not a ""choice"" or a ""human right,"" and all of those people who are guilty of creating a society where women are left with abortion as the sole alternative to destitution are guilty of immensely grave evil.

 Petty bourgeois liberals who've never witnessed real poverty or misogyny in their life have no place to talk about either subject, unless they go out and love people trapped on the bottom rungs of society, instead of going on the internet to advocate for their ""right"" to ""choice"" instead of giving them their time and money so they are not forced into abortion. Show some real solidarity and help out a crisis pregnancy center.

Doctors who perform abortions should be charged for murder and women who receive abortion should receive psychological counseling and assistance with future pregnancies, if the abortion didn't lead to infertility. Women who have abortions are far more often the victims of social injustice than the perpetrators. 

It is a worthless culture that treats a human being as an inconvenience to be removed and funnels money towards this purpose rather than assisting the victimized women who are trapped in the situations that lead to abortion. It is the ultimate depersonalization: To see the most vulnerable person in its most vulnerable spot, view it as a mere parasite, and kill it.

Planned Parenthood was founded as an organization to exterminate blacks, Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist, a key influence on Hitler, and the inherent racism of Planned Parenthood can be observed by the fact that most of their clinics are found in minority neighborhoods, and by the incredibly disproportionately high rates of abortion among blacks.

Abortion must be ended. Not through rule of law, for law will grow out of culture, but through a cultural transformation that values all human life, a culture of life rather than a culture of death, and an all-encompassing solidarity with the victims of an unjust social order. 

And the roots of this unjust social order are the outright rejection of the meaning of the human family and human sexuality. Divorced from their natural ends, we're living in Brave New World and don't even realize it. The family, the most organic social unit, is destroyed by a culture of divorce and abandonment, and sexuality, the means to the end of the family, is debased to a mere end to pleasure with no long term purpose.

It is only by going to the roots of the social problem that the horror of abortion can end. It takes radicalism, not politics.

A rapist is usually a power freak, and do you think that if it was acceptable to punish those who've accused someone of rape, even wrongly, that the ability to turn around the law on the accuser wouldn't be abused by them?

Sure right now rape can be thrown by a woman as long as it's not blatently obvious she's lying, but that's better than them not being able to come forward with fear that they'll be punished if there's not enough evidence.

First, the idea that Genesis 1 can be interpreted not just as historical narrative (as other parts of Genesis or Matthew or Acts would be) but as poetry or ""exalted narrative"".  I got this from Rob Bell's talk called [Everything is Spiritual](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2rklwkm_dQ).

Later on, I read a book called ""The Lost World of Genesis One"" by John Walton, who's a professor at Wheaton College (a big evangelical school).  He posited that if you read the origin account the way its original audience (the Bronze Age tribesmen who had just been rescued by a mysterious god out of slavery) would have understood it, you would not think it was about the literal origins of the universe.  Rather (and this is the basis of my position now) the Genesis account is intended to introduce the Israelites to the God who had just rescued them.  Therefore, the Genesis account answers two fundamental questions much better than it does origins questions:  1) Who is God, what is He like, and how powerful is He? and 2) What is mankind's relationship to Him?  The Israelites were much more interested in those questions than they were about the literal origins of mankind or the universe.  After all, there's no reason to think that *we*, advanced as we are, would understand the answer to that question, never mind the Israelites thousands of years ago."

delanthaenas,changemyview,1388724368.0,"To me, this is like saying it's bad parenting to raise your children as Muslims or Christians.  You believe in a vegan diet, and you've clearly chosen to raise your own children as vegans.  That's fine.  However, you have **no right** to force your beliefs on others, and force everyone to raise their children as you see fit.  You're more than welcome to raise awareness of the benefits of veganism as you see them, but I think that calling people bad parents for raising omnivorous children is unnecessarily incendiary--you're more likely to piss people off than to get them to care about what you have to say.  You say yourself that veganism is a personal sacrifice.  Well, why shouldn't that be a personal choice?  I feel like depriving a child of choice does him or her no good in the long run.  Let's say your child is raised vegan.  They grow up, go off on their own, and discover that they do love meats, and no longer want to make the sacrifice you've chosen for them.  What happens then?  Do you shame them for their choice? 

I can see why you believe that raising everyone vegan is a good thing, and in the long run better for the world.  However, given that I'm sure you also believe in personal freedoms and choices (how would you feel if you lived in a world where you were not *allowed* to raise vegan children?), you can see why educating others while not making their choices for them is the best way to approach this issue."

Making my tools fail - whether it's my debugger or disassembler - in a difficult-to-undo way. Sometimes it just gets too frustrating to keep going, especially if it's encoded multiple times over, and each time is messed up in a different way.

Another is sheer complexity. For example, writing a bytecode interpreter, then writing your code is custom bytecode, them obfuscating the code and the interpreter. I've worked on challenges where people have done that. [This](http://0x80.org/blog/virtualized-crackme-challenge/) is a good example of that, with a challenge + partial solution.

But the bottom line: I almost always find a trick to get around all their nonsense, and let the program decrypt itself or find some side channel to learn what it's doing without necessarily understanding it. In that program above, for example, I found a way to get the password out without even realizing it was an interpreter (I'm gonna be posting a blog about that in hopefully the next couple weeks, so keep an eye on skullsecurity.org or @iagox86 (or /r/ReverseEngineering) for that!)"

If I got paid minimum wage, I'd quit my serving job and find an easier one."

prairie_girls,OkCupid,1388724634.0,"If I just let my life bump along down its merry road I would have a pretty easy go of things.  Traveling is one of the best ways for me to be uncomfortable.  I like being wrong, and being lost, and not understanding what people are saying, and just having to deal with it.  I want to keep traveling and being uncomfortable in the future, so it's important to me that a long-term partner be excited about joining me in Turkmenistan (or Benin, or Papau New Guinea...)."

Or recently add the face pictures?

I swear I just saw this somewhere and didn't see your face.
