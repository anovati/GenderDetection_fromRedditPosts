ibbity,AskReddit,1390780632.0,"Him being a white supremacist has EVERYTHING to do with the article, because it is a manifesto about what white supremacists should do regarding sex. Your claiming that his white supremacism is irrelevant to the article makes about as much sense as claiming that the rules about proper Muslim sexual behavior as set forth in the Quran and the Hadiths should not be interpreted in light of their origin in a Muslim worldview. 

Also, if you claim that my first 3 points have nothing to do with his definition of date rape, then you are either NOT reading the actual document OR my comments, or else you are choosing to misinterpret these AND to completely ignore context. 

His definition of ""date rape"" is a false charge of rape by a woman who was not actually raped, but regrets having sex. However, he defines ""actual"" rape as 

&gt;a violation of a woman’s chastity or marital fidelity

Chastity being her ""virtue"" as an unmarried woman, which is in context the property of her father/her future husband, and the definition of marital fidelity being obvious. This means that, as I already said, he does not consider it rape UNLESS her father or husband are the ones bringing the charge against the despoiler of their property, since

&gt;it would be better to ask how it [rape] could be taken seriously at all once we begin defining it as [a violation of a woman’s...merely personal wishes.]

Since he qualifies ""date rape"" as a false charge of rape by a woman who retroactively regrets the sex, and he considers all charges of rape invalid that are based on ""violation of [the woman's] merely personal wishes,"" it does not take a genius to infer that he believes that women who base their charge of rape on the fact that their ""merely personal wishes"" NOT to have sex were violated are making a ""date rape"" claim.

And since we know that he advocates that ""date rape"" claimers should be forcibly married to their rapists, we can also infer that women whose claims of rape are based on the fact that their ""merely personal wishes"" NOT to have sex were violated should be forced into marriage with their rapists, on the grounds that these women are classified as ""date rape"" criers by the author's definition. 

Is that clear enough for you, or are you going to completely ignore it and repeat for the umpteenth time that you don't believe that the author said what he said?"

If meat were meant to be processed in our system, what's the deal with us having to cook it? If we were meant to eat it, don't you think we could eat ANY type of meat raw without fear of things like salmonella or E-coli? True carnivorous animals eat EVERYTHING on its prey. Head, intestines, stomach, anus, and everything in between. They also have digestive systems VERY different to those of herbivores (especially humans). They can get away with eating raw flesh with bacteria because their system doesn't absorb food like ours does. 

As for you teat theory, yes they are raised to drink their mother's milk (not cows, but that's besides the point) in very early stages of life. What about an eight month old though? One that's crawling, and also eating solid food at this point? 

On top of everything, you completely avoided my points (and even quoted them which is extremely comical) about our hands and instincts. Yes, we have eyes on the front of our head. Just like koalas, beavers, elephants, kangaroos, and many other herbivores have. 

Now are you going to actually address my points, or throw demeaning points around about how I'm ""ignorant""? Sounds like the true ignorant person is you. If you weren't, you would have come up with an educated explanation for each and every point I made.

cs606,keto,1390780700.0,"That study doesn't say anything of the sort! All it says is that fructose is preferentially used to build DNA over glucose, in both the cancerous and ""normal"" cell lines. No difference in behavior is observed that could even suggest that cancerous cells use fructose in a different way to normal cells. If anything, the normal cell-lines had greater increases in RNA/DNA synthesis than the cancerous cells in the same environment.  

The fact that this form of cancer can *use fructose to grow* **does not** mean that the fructose caused those cells to become cancerous. That's like saying ""I went on a killing spree because I ate my normal 3 meals today"", ""The strawberries are rotten through with fungus, because they have been exposed to the same amount of plant food that normally works for them"" or ""All the squirrels around here are black because they eat the same acorns as all of the other squirrels, in the same way""

Even if there was some suggestion that Fructose was mutagenic or carcinogenic (of which there is none in this paper), this would then have to be corroborated by a number of other studies at the tissue and organism level, in combination with case-control studies on humans. 

Here's a semi-decent blog post covering that paper: http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/08/05/fructose-and-pancreatic-cancer/

No, that food insecurity metric *includes* food stamps.  

In other words, this is how many people were living in households that were food insecure sometime in the last year, even with food stamps.

&gt; Evidence? The program is administered by idiots. If you're making an extra $100 per week they don't cut your benefits by maybe $50, not $150.

The system uses thresholds of income (dependent on household sizes).  One can be near a threshold and have a modest increase cause them to lose some or all assistance.

Did you know they even have the kind that jizz?  What the fuck is the point of that?  Who knows what the hell that stuff is made out of!

I live in the Midwest of the US (stay warm, neighbors!!) with my boyfriend and our cat. I met him through OkCupid (reddit seems to be fascinated this fact). We're planning to get hitched in October 2016, which is exciting and fun!

I really like bronze colors, as you can definitely see by my collection picture. I've also never had to own blush, my dimples pretty much take up all that space on my face.

I'm not the most adventurous make-up lover color wise, but I really enjoy how much more confidently I can face the world with a little war paint.

Almost all of my collection of make-up is Clinique and almost all of my nail polish is Essie. I find things I like and stick to them.

_Boo_Boo_,offmychest,1390780919.0,"I was raised a Christian, and similar to you I had those very same questions.  I did not go to a private Christian school, and with the exception of my early life (birth-early teens) I did not go to church regularly.  

Skipping a large part of my story, my questioning eventually all led up to me deciding to take one week off of being a christian.  If at the end of the week I felt happier than before, I was going to continue not being a christian.  The result leads to where I am today, a non-christian.  I feel much happier than I did before, and I think you will too.

I imagine there are other reasons for you questioning/thinking of leaving your faith as well.  I encourage you to look at debate forums to see other arguments others have made, both for and against Christianity.  Decide what makes you happy, whether that means rejoining your christian faith, joining a different one, or becoming non-religious. 

I was lucky in that becoming non-religious was not a huge issue.  My parents let me make my own decisions and allowed me to not go to church anymore.  I had several non-religious friends so that was also not an issue.  If you are concerned about this, join a non-religious forum, there you can find support and talk to others with a similar mindset.

So when I first left I did not know what to call myself, but eventually I found I term I liked and I have stayed with it.  I call myself an Agnostic.  I believe that any religion could be correct, but there is no/not enough evidence to believe in them.  Instead of making a large post about agnosticism, I suggest you look it up.  Some people consider it a temporary position on the ""fence"", but I don't.

If you want to talk more about this, feel free to message me.  I am somewhat new to reddit though, but I am sure we can figure this out.  I might edit this post too to add more info."

Mine never worked her way back into favor and stayed on the surface for the rest of her life.  I kept her a straight fighter with no drow abilities or feats beyond the basic three racial spells per day.

I had also given her the mute drawback, which was fun and frustrating to play and a large part of the reason she felt she needed to leave her family - she resented the fact that she was never respected for her abilities as a fighter, always compared unfavorably to her cleric and sorcerer sisters.  She fought hard, played by the rules, did her best to further her house, but none of that mattered because she wasn't like them in the eyes of their mother.  So, Vala had a mental breakdown and decided to hell with it all - if she couldn't make her family see that she was worthy, she would do it elsewhere.

AshleyYakeley,PurplePillDebate,1390781299.0,"&gt; I edited that before you replied to make it clearer, changing ""biology"" to ""genetics"".

OK, genetics obviously affects all structures of the brain, and all of the rest of the body. I'm pretty sure almost every human being has a corpus callosum, for instance, regardless of developmental environment.

&gt; Shaped or molded due to particular causes making specific effects more likely.

Seriously? Are you telling me that ""female brains are designed to facilitate communication between analytical and intuitive processing modes"" doesn't suggest genetics specifically? Generally ""designed"" refers to evolution (as a replacement for a theory of some supernatural designer).

&gt; ... It examines the brain regions which are involved in the connectome study. 

But doesn't actually examine connectivity.

&gt; Also, don't forget that the entire idea of the connectome was to map out the effects of learning. The entire experimental method is based on the fundamental understanding that it measures learning and the effects of environment.

Perhaps I should be more specific. Do you have any evidence that learning affects, **specifically**, connectivity within each hemisphere of the brain vs. connectivity between them, as measured by this paper?

Hey, I'm not saying it's not possible. Biology never proves anything conclusively. I just don't see any reason to believe it without evidence. Whereas it *is* well known that genetics affects all aspects of brain development.

It's a bit like this: a study is done that observes that women have, on average, larger breasts than men. Now we know that physical behaviour can affect overall body structure in various ways, so it's possible that breast size difference between the sexes is entirely a consequence of environment and behaviour rather than genetics. But I, at least, would like to see evidence that physical behaviour can affect, specifically, breast size before considering that.

Here we have a study that observes that women and men have, on average, different ratios of inter- and intra- hemisphere connectivity. Now we know that learning can affect overall brain structure in various ways, so it's possible that these different connectivities is entirely a consequence of environment and behaviour rather than genetics. But I, at least, would like to see evidence that learning or environment can affect, specifically, inter- and intra- hemisphere connectivity before considering that."

As for your question, are you in decent shape? As /u/Dinosaurathon pointed out, working out should help out. If you feel too slow as far as moving back and fourth and lunging, squats will help. Another great thing is if your schools gym has rowing machines, row for 3 minute intervals with one minute beaks. It will workout your legs as well as improve your endurance.
If your blade just feels too heavy and that's part of your problem then try working out your forearms and triceps. Really it's best to workout everything for balance, but if you want to focus on specific areas those would be it.

You said you feel like you rarely land hits, is that because you miss or because people are parrying you? If you miss, make you could do something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/7fWu1gg.jpg) to improve your point control. If they are parrying you than you either need a faster lunge or maybe need to work more on when to attack and where you should be aiming.

The whole point is that often their well-intentioned attempts to fight bad guys lead to far more damage than the bad guys intended.

Sure, if they are trying to completely destroy the planet it may be worth it, but often it is just some evil money making scheme or a plan to destroy a single building that results in massive death and destruction due to the fighting.

As for Avengers, this is a perfect example of another great point, that often it is the super heroes themselves that cause the villains to exist or at least power up.  

Had SHIELD not messed with the Tesseract, Earth would never have been attacked by aliens.  If Tony hadn't built the Iron Man, then his sleezy partner wouldn't have been able to build his own and attack him.  If he hadn't continued to use it, then other companies wouldn't have kept trying to do the same and hired that crazy Russian guy.

In fact, both Avengers and Iron Man 2 had this fact as a general theme.  That arrogance of the ""heroes"" is what lead to stronger and more destructive villains."

&gt; sports that they can be competitive in like soccer, hockey, and tennis. Music lessons, private schools. Their estimated adult heights are 5'5"" (older one) and 5'2"" (younger). They are also very active in their mosque which really helps because having a religious social circle can really open up the dating pool when they get older.

ricree,AskReddit,1390781472.0,"If you play on the PC, keep an eye out for [Skywind](http://morroblivion.com/skywind-faq). It's a conversion of Morrowind into the Skyrim engine.

The big thing about Morrowind, at least for me, is that its setting and Main quest were way ahead of anything Bethesda's done since. I spoke a bit more about the merits of Morrowind in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1vydbu/what_video_game_do_you_think_all_gamers_need_to/cex9fay), but in short: it does a really nice job with its faction system, layering a lot of independent rivalries together in a way that made the world feel very real. There was a depth of history to it that was lacking in the later games.

There was also a lot more variety and depth in the spells, spellcraft, and enchanting systems, not to mention that there were a lot more ""artifact"" weapons and armor that were genuinely worth seeking out. Since there wasn't the scaling system that turned everything into a generic +1. Granted, Skyrim was better at this than Oblivion, having wisely ditched the whole bandits with Daedric weapons and glass armor thing."

Which is why girl-girl/boy-boy fanfics are thriving everywhere you look, most prevalent in ones which have shown intimacy in **any** way, may it be brotherhood/bromance, sisterly love, rivalries, or even Family Love. 

Any show of any emotion, may it be pity or caring or lust or whatnot, for a character **can** and **will** be used as the base for the shipping.

Don't believe me? Check Twilight on fanfiction.net. Now check both Edward and Jacob. 1.3K? How about Bella and Alice? 1.7K. And that's not including the M rating.

michaelnoir,AskReddit,1390781501.0,"I think the Red Pill are right about some things, but that the whole premise of their philosophy is wrong.

They mistake the imperatives of a specific social and economic system (late capitalism) for inherent biological imperatives. It's a form of naturalistic fallacy. 

Thus they blame the ""nature"" of ""women"" and ""men"" (conceived of as very rigid gender roles) and not the system itself for things they don't like in society, ie, women going after rich men, their own loneliness. 

They fail to take into account or factor in how economically determined a lot of behaviour is. They instead make the very crass error of mistaking these behaviours for biological imperatives, and not outcomes of a class and profit-based society, which distorts all their thinking. 

None of this should take away from the fact that some elements of their critique of third-wave post-feminism are absolutely correct, but they, as it were, blame the wrong culprit. "

Nausved,Dogtraining,1390781532.0,"&gt;Fear response to crouching -- I kept yummy treats in my shirt pocket, and would randomly crouch next to him and feed him a treat. When I needed to sweep or work outside with larger tools, I'd hand him treats here and there.

This is a fantastic idea. OP, you can really expand on this, especially with the help of clicker training.

I would consider clicking and giving the dog a treat when you bend down very slightly, until he's completely comfortable with it; do it at least a few times a day for a couple weeks so it sticks in his longterm memory. Then click and treat when you bend down slightly more, until he's OK with that, too. Keep working at it gradually until you can get all the way down without him being upset at all.

There are a lot of [clicker training videos on YouTube for helping animals overcome various phobias](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=clicker%20train%20fear&amp;sm=3) (like dogs that are afraid to go into certain rooms, horses that are afraid of halters, etc.). I'd watch a couple of these to help you get the hang of it.

You can also utilize this method to get him to stop resource guarding; reward him with an *extra* tasty treat whenever you (or someone else) gets near his food/toys, and then gradually work toward being able to completely take his food/toys away from him without him reacting. Do it just a few times a day over a long period of time and work up gradually, and the lessons will stick better."

namesaremptynoise,explainlikeimfive,1390781821.0,"Uhm, no.  Not 4 billion a year, 4.8 billion between 1995-2009.  Even if that whole chunk *had* come out of the 2009 budget? It would've accounted for 0.01% of it.  As in one cent for every one hundred dollars spent.  So yeah, not a lot of savings there, but I don't blame you, a lot of people don't realize that cutting a million here and a billion there honestly does *not* make a lot of difference to a budget that's in the *trillions*, most of which is allocated to three specialized areas that nobody is allowed to cut.

As far as whether you believe milk or dairy is important to the human diet...  That doesn't really matter.  You're not a nutritionist, or if you are, you're not the head of the USDA or the Surgeon General, so your opinion doesn't really matter much in this case.  For a lot of people, especially poor children, milk is an essential source of calcium, potassium and Vitamin D(which yes I know is added artificially).  

You're also forgetting that ""dairy"" is more than just ""milk.""  Dairy is also cheese, butter, and every dish that's made with milk, cheese, or butter, which is an *awful* lot of the food that westerners(not just americans) eat.  If you cut all that out, then poor people start running out of stuff to eat besides rice and vegetables(which they can't even put butter on)

And to reiterate: 4.8 billion a year is *not* much money in terms of the federal budget, certainly not 4.8 billion a decade.  The payments are so that the price of milk doesn't go too high for low-income families to be able to afford milk, butter and cheese, and so that when the price falls the dairy farmers and their families don't go broke."

Most of us are okay with the idea of bad men and scumbags from news and growing up but we reject that same idea of bad women out there. We want to believe that women are benevolent and worth protecting for the most part but in that we look the other way at shitty things women do.

The thing is, there are a tonne of shitty people out there. Don't be fooled by appearance. If you're gut feeling tells you something is off, then something IS off.

the7ouch,skiing,1390782128.0,"I have a couple rebuttals. 

1) No argument. Skiing is a fun, risky sport. People should take steps to mitigate that risk.


2) How are you supposed to learn or advance your skills without pushing yourself? Ability level is relative, and without trying new things, and more difficult things, there is no advancement. If people always were to ski within their comfort levels, no one would ever improve. 

&gt; You don't have to be on a black to get seriously injured

What are you trying to say? You can get injured anywhere on the hill. I have a semi-pro friend (ie. multiple big name sponsors, kills it everywhere inbounds and backcountry) that recently fractured his femur on a blue run. I know people that have gotten injured in lift line, as well as hitting 40+ foot drops. People get hurt everywhere. Shit happens. 

3) Fully agree

4) Skiing with a buddy is good, but not strictly necessary. If I had to ski with a friend every day I went out, I would have half the days on skis I currently do. And even if I did get hurt, none of my friends carry their backcountry packs with them inbounds - so the only thing that would help would be ski patrol, not whatever granola bar might be in their pocket. He might be lucky you saw it, but he should also be aware that very few people actually carry that extra gear.

He blames the rise of date rape claims on a conspiracy to punish men by FALSELY ACCUSING them. Date rape, which he wants to punish by making the woman marry the man she names the rapist, is a FALSE CLAIM by his definition. 

FALSE CLAIMS are to be punished. He wants to deal with women who are making what he considers FALSE CLAIMS by forcing them to marry the man they name the rapist.

letsgocrazy,AskReddit,1390782207.0,"A few comments here regarding people with autism, so I will add mine.

Mine is different because the fellow involved, Chris, was able to see and hear exactly what was going on, but not properly perceive or understand it.

Years ago in secondary education, a local special needs school was phased into my large, local, poor inner city school; eventually one of the kids, Chris, was placed in my class with the supervision of a special needs teacher.

All well and good - not a nice school, not a nice time for anyone involved.

Fast forward years later and he is actually going to the same university as me (we were probably the only people from my school to go to university - heh).

This time, however, he was at a club night at our student union - clearly his assistant or whatever had told him to go out and socialise or whatever - except this being a club night everyone was pissed up and dancing.

So at the end of the night, I see him standing outside the exit, literally - and this is was horrified me the most - a crowd of people were standing around him in a circle and mocking him. Adults - of university age - 18, 19 and up.
I've never been more ashamed of humanity in my life.

I remember one guy calling his mates over to join in ""hey, look at this guys, he's well trippy, fucking mong.."" etc.

So I kind of run up to him and say ""Hey Chris, are you OK, are you alright?"" and start talking to him. But he really has no idea what is going on. He doesn't know if people are being mean, friendly, or what.

So I tell everyone to fuck off

""what's this, is he your mate or something?""
""yes""
""ha ha""

So the crowd subsided. Annoyingly, the girl I was pulling didn't witness this, but in a way that's better.

So I was speaking to Chris a little ""do you remember me?"" ""yes, I remember you.. hello..""

The poor guy had no idea what was going. From being sent to a student union club night, to a crowd of people mocking him. No idea."

Do not worry about this. If in a month you conclusively decide that yes you are asexual or no you are not asexual then you will still be the same person you were a month ago. Yes or no will not really matter when it comes to solving any relationship issues. The issues themselves are what you should focus your energies on rather than labels. The labels do not cause issues and they do not solve them. The label is simply a useful tool of language to better discuss what you are already feeling."
nobledoug,ReadMyScript,1390782211.0,"I had to download it, the link was acting funny.

As for formatting, you don't have to use CUT TO: in between every transition.  That's kind of the old style of writing, you don't see it much anymore.  Secondly, the first scene gives us a bit more camera direction than I personally lie.  Some is fine, but too much gets difficult to read.  The other problem is that you give us a CUT TO from that scene into the same scene with a new slug line.  You don't need to do that, you can just say Ben walks in.  I can see your instinct in thinking that since you are envisioning a cut, you have to use CUT TO and then give a new slugline, but none of that is necessary.  

There are a few grammatical hiccups such as your/you're problems and that sort of thing.  It would be useful to run through it with a friend who is solid with that, or a teacher or something if they are available.

Side note, your Title up: has an extra t in the middle.

I'll start with the things that I liked.  I liked the vinyl theme that kept recurring, and I like the nostalgic implications that go along with that.  It gave the script a little bit of flavor rather than having them hang out at some generic park or something. I think that you could expand this theme and potentially add in some metaphors from the vinyl that better explain Ben's depression.

I liked the basic idea here, that a depressed person would start slipping into the void without his friends noticing, and then a sudden flash of realizations leads to them barely getting there in time to save him, or just in time to see him go.  

As for the problems with the story, there seems to be a lot of internal stuff going on that are hard to translate onto the screen.  Those things are really hard to write.

For example, Ben goes from sad to taking pills and happy to taking pills and being sad (at least that was what I understood).  But there aren't really any markers there that give us reason for those shifts. Why was the Zoloft not working in the beginning and then working in the middle? Why does he go from so happy with Emma on page 9 to trying to kill himself on page 11? We need some more continuity and reasoning going on between these events.



Emma seems to be something of a factor in his happiness, but it's like she wants him more than he wants her in the beginning and there's no point where we really understand that he cares as much about her as she does about him.

This ties into the problem with your climax, it really comes out of nowhere.  We don't see a lot of (if any) character development with Ben.  I know that 11 and 1/8 pages isn't much, but he just goes from depressed to happy to depressed.  I didn't really get a sense that there was anything building up so dramatically, like that he was getting more and more depressed and something had to give.  It almost read more like he was having a really bad day.

The sequence with Josh realizing that Ben is in trouble is the most problematic in terms of internal things not being shootable.  He just suddenly basically realizes that Ben is depressed and that when they were talking about suicide (which makes me think Josh is an absolute prick and no friend to Ben at all) that Ben wasn't joking, but that was before he got happy, so that is sort of a false clue.  Moreover, if you want individual shots of all these clues, format it as a montage so that we can make those jumps too.

I think that you have a solid idea at the core of this thing, but I think that you need some more experience reading/writing in order to make it shine.  Good luck and keep writing!"

TRP is a board that claims women are only good for sex. That thread is *complaining* about a woman not wanting to only be good for sex, like how dare she, right?

If he's trying to maintain his public persona, then that's not an option. It would be much harder to kill the Joker, since he wouldn't put himself in danger, and thus would have to rely on other, less capable, people.

Still, he could probably do it. Hire the top combatants and assassins in the world, and give them strict orders.

* A buddy system, and you can't let your partner out of your sight.
* No masks, concealing make-up, or anything else that obscures the face.
* Code words will be provided, as will ""panic"" words.
* All equipment will be supplied and personally checked by Lex.
* No back-stabbing. When the clown dies, everyone gets paid in full.
* Everyone will be equipped with personal air-tight force fields. Air will be provided by a tank inside of the force field.
* Everyone must undergo the Everyman Project procedure to get X-ray vision and super senses.

And if the Joker shows up in Luthor's office, Luthor shoots him mid-monologue with a handgun, assuming he gets the passwords to pass the security systems in place at every possible entrance.

Joker is scary and unpredictable, but Luthor is smart enough, rich enough, and paranoid enough to cover every possibility on his home turf."

AshleyYakeley,PurplePillDebate,1390782623.0,"I'd say I generally agree. I think uninterest in long-term relationships represents a kind of narcissistic damage. This is my main complaint with TRP. Now not all of TRP is like this, but it is quite a common theme that seems to be part of their rejection of marriage, for example.

So if all you're interested in is getting laid with as many attractive women as possible, that interest is evidence of narcissism in the first place, plus the narcissism will help you get laid, plus the kinds of women you're looking for, notably the most attractive women who are most open to getting laid, are likely to be more narcissistic themselves and respond better to your narcissism.

What I want to know is, for those looking for healthy sexual *relationships* with attractive American women rather than a succession of lays, and one is not unhealthily narcissistic, does it help to act or become more narcissistic?"

Sabu113,reddevils,1390782731.0,"A chance is strong language. 

Ozil would not have made sense. It would have been a bad buy for us regardless of the talk about buying whatever star player there is and figuring a system out later (rather ironic considering the team they support). No one was going to get him the ball. He doesn't play on the wings and for the price is he a giant upgrade on the potential of Kagawa? Not in my estimation. 

Mata is partially a panic buy in the sense that he gives Moyes a little credibility and is an obvious sop to the fans in a season wheres there's little and less. Mata means Moyes gets more good will and songs at matches. Mata also means Moyes has brought in a big player and others can be reassured that more spending will occur so that the likes of Young and Cleverly won't be the class of player they are partnering with. 

We still need to see how we do getting the ball up to Mata and how Moyes uses him. Great player but I think there has been a massive overestimation about what he can do on his own. Also imo if Mata was always in their eyes, he's a far better pick up than Ozil in terms of risk. You know what Mata has done in the premier league- you don't know that about Ozil. If Mata isn't clicking then it's unarguable that the problem lies somewhere else in the club. 

...

I did find it striking that Mata said he wanted to come to Manchester. I imagine he would have a decent pick of clubs just about anywhere - even with pretty established set ups. Maybe not at 37 mil but he probably could have moved. It's nice to know where he wanted to go."

That's actually how most real-time multiplayer games work, so congratulations! You just independently-invented [Client-Side Prediction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_prediction)! 

Valve has a [great article that explains the Source engine's networking implementation](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking), which mentions client-side prediction, lag compensation, smoothly correcting for discrepancies between client- and server-state, etc. I assume most of the same techniques are used in MMOs."

Zeppelanoid,Gamecube,1390782900.0,"This list restricted to games I've owned and played:

1. SSX Tricky

This is entirely a personal choice. I don't think that it's the *best* game for the Gamecube, but it's my *favourite*. To me, this game epitomizes what this era was all about. It was EA Sports BIG, it was huge, in your face, and xtreme. It was also tons of fun and had a great soundtrack.

 /2. THPS 3

As you can see, I had a special spot for the alternative sport games in this era. THPS 3 took everything established in the first two games and improved it. What a game, what a soundtrack. Never before had I put as many hours into a game as I did THPS 3. I got it on launch and tried (successfully) to unlock EVERYTHING the game has to offer. And I loved every minute of it.

 /3. Super Mario Sunshine

I never had Super Mario 64 for whatever reason, and I was jealous of my friends that did. So when I got my hands on Sunshine, it felt like redemption. This game was awesome. Awesome setting, cool attention to details...still my favourite 3D Mario platformer. 

 /4. NBA Street Vol. 2

It's hard to accurately describe just how *cool* this game was when it came out. The And 1 mixtapes were in full popularity, and all of the sudden all my friends wanted to play basketball. I had a lot of fun beating people 1-on-1 IRL since I was an actual basketball player. Anyways, this game itself was amazing, cool, and unique. Tons of fun.

 /5. Wind Waker

This game is only so low on the list because I've only had it for a few months. I have yet to put a lot of time into this game but I can already tell that it will likely end up in my top 3. 

 /6. THPS Underground

A lot of people didn't like how Underground marked the beginning of a departure from the traditional THPS design, but I LOVED it. It had more of a ""story"" mode than every before, and the controls became so much more versatile now that you could leave your board and roam around.

 /7. MVP Baseball 2005

The fact that this is still the best baseball game out there speaks volumes about the quality of this title. Enough said.

 /8. Madden 2004

I'm not a huge football fan, so I was less than excited to receive this game as a present, given that I already owned Madden 2002. This game, however, was such an instant classic that it vaulted into one of my favourites. Revamped gameplay with a great ownership mode.

 /9. Metroid Prime

Similarly to Wind Waker, I only got this game recently. It will vault up higher on my list once I give it more playing time, but I already love it.

 /10. Medal of Honor: Rising Sun

I guarantee that this game will be on no one else's top 10 list. This game was just too much fun for me. I loved the single player mode. This was, at the time, the greatest FPS I had ever played. I still occasionally play this game with friends. We've been playing 4 player split screen multiplayer consistently since this game came out. We love it. Shout out goes to 007 Agent Under Fire, which in my opinion is tied with Rising Sun for best FPS experience on the Gamecube (of the ones I've played). 

So, like I said, this list is heavily biased based on my likes and experiences. Sports are heavily represented, and some classics like Melee are missing (to this day I have still never played it). "

itsachickenwingthing,truegaming,1390783010.0,"We try to divorce the reviewer from the review, attributing the review to the reputation of the site that published it. It's part of this fascination of with objectiveness.

The problem is that we as consumers don't play games as objective players. We like certain things in games and dislike others. We favor certain genres over others. Is it really feasible that there's an objective review that can be helpful to every flavor of gamer out there?

I find that the most useful review comes from a reviewer who has preferences that are similar to their audience (which is to say that they fully disclose their preferences). The central reason why we turn to reviews - besides out of confirmation bias - is to figure out whether we will enjoy a certain game and whether we should purchase (*sic*) it. If there were a reviewer who is basically *you*, for all intents and purposes, then their opinion of the game should be helpful to you. The brand of the reviewer needs to be front and center, not the brand of the review's publisher; a publisher might gain from publishing multiple reviews from different writers, rather than picking one reviewer to write the definitive review for that publisher. And even if that reviewer has open preferences, this format also prevents the other writers that work for the publisher from formally publishing their opinions."

Whizbang,askscience,1390783018.0,"Cloud computing is more than just server-based software, but the term is fuzzy.

Yes, cloud applications are generally a form of server applications, but

* they're generally sold as services or subscription services run by a different company from the subscriber. (But there's also an emerging concept of the ""private cloud"" where a cloud architecture is sold to large enterprises who run it themselves.)

* since the applications are generally managed by only one company, they don't have to be as fully packaged. If you are a company that manufactures some sort of product that another company purchases and runs themselves, you may have to spend a lot of development perfecting installation, migration and upgrade, management and serviceability software. Furthermore, the software may have lots of additional features designed to accommodate a broad base of customers who run the service, because the service is deployed over and over in different environments. With cloud software, there is basically just one operator of the software. This means it can be much more like a systems integration exercise, where the operator cobbles together a bunch of different components to make the service work.

* Cloud services can be EXTREMELY decomposed compared to the same piece of software in an enterprise environment. While you might sell single-server solutions to a smaller enterprise, clouds can throw scores of different types of services at a problem and then just hire the additional staff needed to run them.

* An aspect of cloud computing is something called ""elastic"" computing, in which additional processing and processes are dynamically spun up as the system detects more demand for the service.

* Cloud services are generally hosted in the Internet, which means much more effort is spent looking at securing the services from attack. If you are a piece of enterprise software, you can sometimes assume (less and less nowadays) that you're running in a data center environment in which the IT department has deployed other components--firewalls and such--to secure your service from attack. If you're running a cloud service, you don't have a viable offer unless your end-to-end integration also implements components for protecting your application core.

* Cloud services are inherently multi-tenant / multi-user and often incorporate the idea of partial migrations where you roll out upgrades to a select set of users and then roll them back if things aren't working.

* Cloud services often include the concept of rapid deployment. Instead of version updates happening on a multiple month basis, the idea is that new software and bug fixes can be rolled out every couple of weeks.

""Cloud"" a buzzword? Totally. But it's more than just another word for ""server,"" as it adds on additional business model, management strategy, and infrastructure connotations. "
Monosentence,leagueoflegends,1390783023.0,"Save it. Next time you get a 1350 or higher, you're almost definitely going to have an amount left over that would only afford you a low end skin, or a midrange champ on sale (the 1350-4800 champs for instance, which are IP buys- not rp buys).

Then, when you get a 975 skin (Or two skins on sale) and have 400 left over from 1350, you have 180 sitting in your bank that'll put you over what you'd need for a 975 skin on sale.

I was enrolled in CS 101 at the time, which was a few rooms away. I decided that I cared more about finishing the conversation than going to my class and that I could probably talk the prof into letting me sit in on the higher level class since I'd taught myself a bit of programming already.

I ended up deciding that I fit better into the 201 class and officially switched into it later that week. By the end of the semester I'd added CS to my major. It was the second semester of my sophomore year, and if I'd taken the 101 class instead, I'd have had a very difficult time fitting in all the required classes for the CS major (most of which had 201 as a prerequisite) and probably would not have bothered changing my major.

Also since you use the flexors so much they could just be really tight and that tightness could disproportionately pull on the joint and cause pain in the extensors since they are constantly being pulled on by the tight flexors.  So its an imbalance in tension or tightness in the muscles.  It's something to consider. I feel as if this is my problem except my pain is manifesting up in my elbows.

You need to not give a shit about disappointing or creeping people out or whatever excuse you have for not online dating. Most likely neither person will get exactly what they were hoping for or expecting, but the disappointment that happens is the natural one that occurs when you try dating, and its not going to be the specific scenario you're imagining. 

The point is not that online dating is great. The point is that you are are making excuses and you are hoping for this warm and welcoming situation that will help you. Well, it's probably not going to happen that way. You need to learn to initiate what YOU want to happen, try to be a decent and honest person along the way, and just let things happen.

This was in the context of female complaints on guys in their dating pool, but I think the analogy holds here as well because it highlights the imbalance between the genders when it comes to dating.

namesaremptynoise,explainlikeimfive,1390783825.0,"Because without market controls in an oversupply situation the price can completely tank to the point where it's impossible for the farm to make enough profit to stay solvent.  Just because they're producing a lot this year doesn't mean that their equipment has gotten cheaper to maintain or that feed or livestock have gotten cheaper in accordance, and it sure as hell doesn't mean their property taxes go down.  And in a bad year when the supply goes down, the prices can easily rise *too* high to the point where people stop buying.  Sure, $100 per lot sounds better than $10 lot, except if you're only selling 1 lot at $100 and you normally sell 1000 lots at $10.  Insurance is good when you can actually get them to cough up the money...  But just like with health or auto or any other kind of insurance you can usually only get them to cough up a percentage of what you *thought* they were promising you, and then they raise your rates. 

As far as crop diversification and bad years = time to move...  Yeah, that's a nice idea if you've got the money and the time.  Farming is brutally hard work and a farm is a lot more expensive to keep up than most people realize, everything is always breaking or getting sick or dying, and everything is incredibly expensive, you can almost never keep solvent.  On the ""good years"" you maybe, *maybe* finally dig yourself out of debt.  If you have a few good years in a row, you might be able to afford a new piece of machinery without having to take out more loans to get it.  And you can't just pack up and move either, first of all that'd require hundreds of thousands of dollars to establish a new farm, if you could find the land, and second of all you can't just start farming whatever patch you decide you want to, the land has to be arable and unclaimed, and, thanks to really shitty or no planning at all over the centuries, most of the arable land on the planet is now covered by cities.

I'm not exactly fired up about this, but having grown up on a farm, in farm country, I see the other side of the situation.  Is the current situation perfect?  Not at all.  Are there a few bad customers(particularly agro-corps) taking advantage of these programs?  Absolutely  But that doesn't mean that the whole system should just be cut loose and the farmers left to fend for themselves, either, most of the beneficiaries of these programs are good, hard-working people just trying to get by and providing the country with food in the process.

She kept trying to get me to make up with my dad, and actually got upset when I told her that wasn't going to happen.

Then, when she decided to divorce me, she used all of the things I had confided in her against me, basically telling me that I was worthless and would never amount to anything.  This was after I had graduated from college, was making a good wage as a computer programmer, and had bought a nice house with her.  

Sooooo, after that I wasn't ever going to tell anyone about my childhood ever again.  Even when I met my current wife and we hit if off I still kept my childhood a secret.  She had a very similar childhood so as she started telling me her stories I felt that I could tell her some of mine.  It still took years but I eventually opened up to her."

harle,ffxiv,1390783958.0,"I'm pulling in about 200k/day crafting HQ leve items, class quest items, and critical craft mats (aldgoat leather, horn glue, linen yarn etc) that only exist from gatherables. Admittedly, not a lot compared to what crafting used to make, but it's quite solid all the same.  HQ Alchemy mats in general seem to have a very high profit margin - eg., HQ rubber atm is 700gil on my server, but it's low-level craft from a 7gil npc mat. Silver ingots, basilisk ingots, all the mid-range mats that are required for class quests.

Overall it's still very easy to make money with crafting, but not in the same manner it was before. Selling items to other crafters, as opposed to selling HQ 2stars to DoW/M, is what I find profitable. There's no more huge ticket items like 2stars afaik, but there's lots of profit in 5k, 6k chunks at a time.

Likewise, spiritbonding is still somewhat decent if you craft your own items. It's no longer necessary to craft 1-stars and spend extra time binding those, to get T4 materia. I've had it convert off of i44, and i49 seems to be roughly 1/5, 1/6 for me. The materia themselves sell at a decreased rate, but given that you're now able to SB at an increased rate, no longer relying on 1star, it's not too bad overall. 

Finally, and this ties into crafting somewhat, NQ leve items. There's quite a few that sell unreasonably cheap on the AH atm. As in, lower than the cost of making them. Eg., Mahogany logs on my server sell ~60gil ea, x3 + shards to make lumber, lumber sells ~20-30gil x99. There's a triple leve turn-in for these. If you've no desire to level up other classes, or have already capped them all, you can buy up these cheap nq mats to burn on your leves. Alchemy likewise, is fairly cheap to craft HQ items of - the base items for hi-pots and some of the potions are like, dirt nothing on the AH. 

It's mostly a matter of identifying what's cheap on your server, market research and all."

These are mostly story driven games that touch on subjects close to home. The feelings of discovery and wonder, or loss versus achievement.

So, if you are still interested, here are my suggestions:

*Deus Ex Human Revolution (Director's Cut) or the original Deus Ex (Thief angle)

His response certainly strikes me as reasonable, but it only approaches the problem from the perspective of economic theory, which is a normative field and I suppose has validity there, but it fails to take into account social phenomena and the ethic implications of it. Of course, economics is a value-free science, but that doesn't mean that economics doesn't have very immediate ethical application. It's no coincidence that ethicists and economists are often the same person."

[This thread in particular will be really immensely helpful!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/sgcck/f1_explained_videos_for_the_new_f1_fans_in_the/)  Skimming [the wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_1) would also be helpful, there's tons of info there too.

The 2014 F1 calendar can be found [here](http://www.formula1.com/races/calendar.html), race day being on the Sunday.  They run two practice sessions Friday, a third practice session Saturday, with qualifying also on Saturday.  Qualy can be entertaining sometimes, but mainly just watch the races.  Pre and post-race coverage gives a lot of good info too, so try and watch on a good network to catch that stuff (I personally recommend SkyF1 streams or torrents, they seem to have the best English coverage right now).  Also, on the right hand side of the [main F1 site](http://www.formula1.com/default.html), there's a handy graphic that tells when the next race weekend is.  Once the weekend gets closer, they'll give weather info for each session, and you can convert times to your local time zone right there.

But that's about it for now.  Start hanging around the sub, check out that thread, [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8suj_tXNyE) [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGUZJVY-sHo) [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7Ifcgl789E) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k4pun6j0Fg), and don't miss Melbourne on March 16th!

SmartassRemarks,AskMen,1390784308.0,"I think income inequality is a symptom of a problem more than anything. The fact that so many millions of people don't have the economic leverage to command a living wage is an indictment of our education and training system.

How about instead of using taxes to distribute money to people, we improve the way we educate and train people? Give a man a fish, he eats for a day. Teach a man to fish, he eats for a lifetime.

The people who are most economically disadvantaged are the people who are born in ""the hood"" or people born in stagnating rural towns. Why? Because the inner city has major societal problems such as high rates of imprisonment, single motherhood, and gang violence. Rural towns don't have a culture that encourages education, and it's hard to attract industry as a result.

Those people are not suffering because of any reasons other than social/societal/circumstantial. It's not like Warren Buffet is raping and pillaging these communities. We aren't going to pull those people out of poverty by demanding Wal Mart pay cashiers $25 an hour.

We need to think, as a society, what we can do to improve the culture in these areas. Maybe we should end the drug war. Maybe if we end the drug war, gangs won't have as much financial power. Maybe we'd see fewer men in prison, and more fathers in people's lives. As for rural areas, that's a lot more of a cultural thing. Why work hard in school when dad needs help on the farm? Who has time for school when their parents are fucked up on meth all the time and the baby needs someone to care for him?

It's a lot more complicated than ""let's hate on all the rich and get revenge!"" The people who are losing out to the rich are the people who even had a chance in the first place. There are major societal problems here and it's not simply about greed or lust for power on Wall Street."
ponysniper2,seduction,1390784308.0,"My mindset as soon as I saw success in failure. Most people give up because they don't wanna fail and look like fools. They want everything instantaneously. They don't wanna put any of the work or effort. All they see is the ending goal. Forgetting that the goal isn't really the best part about success, it's the journey. Constantly failing but slowly prevailing. Progressing slowly, but enjoying every step of it. And then once you hit your goal, once all your little victories add up into a big one you were working for, you look back and smile at your story. At all your victories, all your defeats, and all your lessons learned. That's were the true glory in success comes from (at least in my view), proving to yourself you could something regardless of the obstacles in your path."

ijustlovemath,cheatatmathhomework,1390784328.0,"d/dx(tan(x)) = sec^(2)(x)

int sec^(2)(x) dx = tan(x) + C

tan(pi) = 0, tan(0) = 0, 0-0= 0, right?

Well, not exactly. Because sec^(2)(x) approaches infinity in between the two limits, this is an improper integral, and must be treated as such.

Where does it become improper? Well, wherever something happens that causes some sort of ""bad"" math to happen. In this case, there's a division by 0 where x = pi/2.

So now we need to split up our integral:

int sec^(2)(x) dx from x = 0 to pi becomes:

[int sec^(2)(x) dx from x=0 to pi/2^(-)] + [int sec^(2)(x) dx from x=pi/2^(+) to x=pi]

Using the same antiderivative as before, we get:

[tan(x) evaluated from pi/2^(-) to 0] + [tan(x) evaluated from pi to pi/2^(+)]

[tan(pi/2^(-)) - tan(0)] + [tan(pi) - tan(pi/2^(+))]

Simplifying:

tan(pi/2^(-)) - tan(pi/2^(+)) ~ +infinity - (-infinity) ~ 2* infinity, which is the form of something that diverges. Now, what I did just there, with the adding and subtracting of infinities, is pretty highly illegal in a math sense; I just wanted to give you a better ""feel"" for where that divergence comes from.

So I hope that helps, but if I was in any way unclear, let me know and I'll explain a little more."

Fox Farms OF isn't enough for an entire grow; you're going to need nutrients. An easy solution for beginners is GH FloraNova Grow &amp; Bloom.

Even then that complicates the situation because OF is a super soil and you shouldn't add nutrients for the first couple weeks. May be easier all together switching to a regular soil like Fox Farm Happy Frog.

This would only be the case if  personal space travel was available to the public. Any government or corporate controlled  interplanetary immigration would most likely be meticulously planned.

 In my corporate dream initially only those critical to colonisation such as technicians, engineers, labourers, medical staff etc plus their families would be sent. Then as the infrastructure is underway you'd send those rich enough to buy really nice properties and get in as the first wave of migrants in a brand new ""utopia"" that would be ready made and waiting for them. This would provide additional funding. If this was a government project then add in some lucky ordinary citizens in with the elite and put them somewhere nice but relatively modest."

bubbish,AskMen,1390784600.0,"You speak a lot of sense. It's true that women are basically limited to that pool of men who are strong initiators. The problem is that the guys outside of that subset basically miss out on the action altogether. If a girl is passive, then she will usually still have options. If she wants to transition to a more active style, she has less work to do.

However, if a guy is passive his pool of options is a lot smaller and more limited. That's when they will take what they can get because female initiators are more rare. You can't argue with the fact that guys have more to lose by being passive. Lowering standards is by no means something I'd recommend but if the alternative is to find almost no girl, I can understand why they do that."

I have witnessed this myself, and [here is a link with more eyewitness testimony to that](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110105123825AA5m2fu)) and can be addressed by administering anesthetic before the operation.

I was circumcised as an infant, myself. I don't feel that a cruelty was perpetrated on me. Isn't it presumptuous of others to tell me otherwise? All the more so to use this presumptive cruelty as a reason to infringe upon freedom of religion and ban a practice which is sacred to many.

Consider that someone who is born into a religion that mandates circumcision presumably *wants* to have been circumcised as an infant, once he is old enough to hold an opinion on the matter. By banning infant circumcision, you are not acting in his interest, but contrary to it."

I think there is something particular to a good book that allows you to understand another person's perspective in a way few other mediums are able to.

Then, when I matured, I realized how embarrassing the whole thing was and spent a long time apologizing to people.

In general, when somebody gets frustrated with the way things are going for them, they react in one of two ways. Some people look inward and try to change who they are or how they act. This is the better approach. Others become infuriated with what they believe to be ""the system"" and come to believe that they are being treated unfairly. Then, someone comes along and thrusts a book in their hands or offers to teach them the secrets of the universe (for a price, of course), and they, in their vulnerability, choose to go along with it.

Corbenik,whowouldwin,1390784989.0,"I'll use a generic version of Sherlock and just say how it differs from the specific versions.

L is essentially just your all-around genius investigator. It isn't that he doesn't notice incredibly small things that change the course of his investigation, it's that he doesn't *need* to because he sees how all of it gets put together. For example, if Sherlock were to see a murder, he would be able to to deduce the time of the murder, some notable facts about the murderer, and at the very least take note of some inconsistencies. He has almost never been able to put together motive until after figuring out who actually committed the murder, unless money is involved. 

When L sees the same murder, he deduces when it takes place and comes up with a list of things that the killer would need to have. He still notices all of the minute details that Sherlock would, but he uses them as additional evidence to prove that someone is guilty rather than the initial evidence that would cause him to suspect them. He immediately comes up within specifics of the murder that narrows the murderer down to ~2 people within a couple of hours. The next morning the police pick up the killer. Keep him away from an emotional connection and you've got one of the best detectives in fictional history. 

For comparison's sake, L *basically* (and that's a big basically) caught Light from death note, who was using a supernatural weapon to kill hundreds of people around the globe in a way that left no physical evidence. He went from virtually no information to having found that person in a remarkably short amount of time.

The other advantage that L has is that he's actually pretty good at profiling, while Sherlock's many incarnations tend to be basically inept at that skill. Sherlocks tend to replace actual profiling with the process of abduction. BBC's Sherlock is particularly bad about this, as he's incapable of stepping back and looking at his Joker/Batman-esque relationship with Moriarty.

The main exception would be the Sherlock from Sherlock NYC, who plays with psychology quite a bit. He also has a more generic skillset than most Sherlocks.

To answer your question directly, it depends on whether or not L already knows about the Sherlock he's facing. I consider L to be the better detective, but they'll both solve the crime equally quickly *unless* L designs the crime around Sherlock's very particular skills. So draw 8/10 times. 1/10 times L wins due to planning around it, 1/10 times L wins because he luckily chose to kill a random person from miles away with a sniper rifle with no motive or attachment before deporting (but not killing) said sniper to India. Sherlock should never be able to construct a murder scene that would hinder L, because L would immediately realize that the murder scene was constructed for him and would narrow down the suspects accordingly.

Exceptions: Movie Sherlock was pretty good at recognizing that something was up in the first movie. He would probably realize if someone put together a crime scene designed specifically to evade him. He wins 1/10 times, with 8/10 still being a draw and 1/10 going to L. Sherlock from Sherlock NYC was a somewhat less spectacular detective than his counterparts, and he would come to a draw 7/10 and lose 3/10."

Toby-one,polandball,1390785007.0,"Sweden has been at peace for 200 years so most of us don't know that winning in war is not as black or white as in games or movies. One must remember that war is a continuation of policy so land gains or land lost is not what decides outcome.

Finland lost the winter war in the sense that they lost ground but they showed that they would resist any further attempt to invade and more importantly that they **could** resist. Which is an important message to send, if you want to remain a sovreign nation. Finlands wargoal throughout the war was never to gain ground or to keep their territory but rather to maintain their independence. So if you view the war in it's entirety then eventhough they lost the winter war, it helped Finland achieve their main wargoal of remaining an independent nation in the post ww2 era.

The Soviet Union achieved their initial wargoal of taking ground in order to secure Leningrad, which is a win for them. They did however fail to subjugate Finland and incorporate them into the union, which was their later war goal. It is a lot more complicated than determining that one side won or lost the war because there are a lot of political interests here that one must take into account."

terp02andrew,overclocking,1390785080.0,"1) Yeah those temps are fine for a synthetic. I would strongly suggest you try looping the x264 Benchmark, Pass 2 (script is in DarkWizzie's thread - the one linked on the sidebar).

The temperatures from that test will be far more in line with what you see during gaming or your non-synthetic (i.e. real-world) application use. I'm glad you're not using AIDA for stress-testing though. Seriously even the most unstable overclocks easily pass it and as a result gives users a false sense of security in having a 24/7 stable overclock. 

2) Please keep track of your BSOD codes - use BlueScreenView to easily look at the ""Bug Check Code."" If you spot a trend of 101s, it's a clear sign to bump your VRIN/VCCIN/Input voltage. Do it in 0.05 or 0.1v bumps.

3) Heh - it's very different from something like Lynnfield or even the previous Ivy/SB era chips. It's why I am adamant that your **recommendations only come from users who have successfully overclocked a Haswell chip** :P

When he left us with mom we had a hard time accepting that he was a good man because he didn't keep in touch, he never called us and mom would always be the one that called him and ran after him.

After we grew up though, I went to therapy to deal with my own insecurities and issues and I got over them. I decided to write to my dad and put together what really happened. He was a really nice man, very calm and extremely supportive. I learned that my mom had been feeding us her anger all while we were growing up and he has kept his distance because he was diabetic and had a lot of other health issues that he just couldn't handle the drama.

Long story short, I am 30 now, my parents separated when I was 14. My mom poured her hurtful emotions into her kids but when we grew up some of us decided we want him in our life and some decided we don't. I wrote and got in touch with him and found out that he really is a great man with a big heart.

If it's correct, you have 120w to play with for the front lighting (using the Ruckus' wiring harness), as it says the lights are run straight off the batteries.

If you want to run lights off the stator, you have a lot more juice to play with - the input to the CDI from the stator should read between 20v and 150v, depending on throttle. You'll have to test that with an amp meter (or the ac amperage setting on your DMM) to figure out your total input wattage."

However those places do tend to close fairly early. They're good for dinner/pre-drinks before the concert. Food at Pedal Pusher and Morrell &amp; Co is pretty good.

You may want to venture further if you want to party later. Victoria St is a good wee haunt and probably not too expensive in terms of taxiing. Up that end you've got:

* The Carlton
* Smash Palace
* Revival
* King of Snake
* Tequila Mockingbird
* Mashina Lounge (Underneath the casino, R20)
* Harlequin Public Ale House
* Cruz (local gay bar)

You can also shoot down an opposite direction to the Moorhouse/Madras/St Asaph street area. There you'll find:

TheOtherKav,tall,1390785238.0,"First off, I love your username!

Ok, on to your questions!

&gt;1) Is this something you'll pursue long term? If you're stationed at other sea-side locations in the states?

**Yes, the nice thing about work is that if I go to any other state save for Hawaii the need to allow me time to sail her to my next duty station. I would love to get stationed in California.**

&gt;2) What drove you to make the decision and do it?

**Lifelong dream**

&gt;3) What kind of sailing experience did you have prior to owning Stubby-Arms?

**None at all**

&gt;4) All that wood looks really pretty, is there parts of it you have fixed up or are planning on fixing it up? Plans for future improvements?


**I have not started on any of the wood. Most of my projects are on the outside of the boat. Repainting, fixing the wood outside, new sails and so on. Inside she's getting a new oven/stove that's bigger (and the right size), new navigation electronics/radar, and some odds and ends. Right now I am rebuilding her main compass. Just waiting on parts, and then that will be good for another 20 years.**

&gt;5) What kind of size bed equivalent do you get in that space?

**The v-berth would be between a king and queen due to it's shape, Then another queen, two two fulls, and a twin**

&gt;6) I assume Laundry-mat or facilities there?

**Yes they do, but I use my friends' washers and driers. It's free and I get to hang out with my buddies too. Winning all around**

&gt;7) Does your storage facility have lots other stuff or do you want live kinda bare bones in the long term for post-mil retirement?

**Right now it has everything to fill a house save for couches, and a washer/drier. I'm trying to get it down to just clothes for the off season. I'd rather have a few nice things then tons of crap.**

&gt;8) How did you research this kind of thing? Did you spend weeks looking up info or do you have friends/experience? I spent like 2 weeks researching my Jeep, so i can't imagine trying to buy a boat and having no idea what to look for/check/measure/test.

**I spent about a year and a half researching, and looking for boats**

&gt;Props to you! This is super cool and I bet such a good money saver. Thanks for sharing!

**Thanks, It's been hard sometimes, but I'm learning. It can save money, but at the same time I plan on dropping $20-60,000 to refinish her. $12K of that is just sails**"

I have no presupposition that inequality is a fact of the world that will ever change. And if something ever does happen to ""fix"" inequality, government action will likely not have any part in it.

What I do see is the sheer heights that we've achieved. Not only do the lowest class in developed countries live better than kings did a thousand years ago (internal plumbing, clean water, electricity, etc.), but our richest are exponentially richer than ever before. Ethics and morality aside, it's just incredible. All else aside, I don't see anything wrong with mere fact that a few individuals have achieved the levels of wealth that they have while so many people still live in poverty; I don't think it's an issue that's necessarily in need of a solution.

In the case where wealth is taken unjustly, then I do have a problem. The thing is that cases like that seem to be the minority; for every Bernie Madoff there are a dozen Warren Buffett's.

If you ever have the time, have a marathon and watch some of the talks that Hans Rosling has given. [This one gets shared a lot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZoKfap4g4w), and here's [another more optimistic view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTznEIZRkLg).

What's the metric that is decided by?

This is my home school district: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_School_District

&gt;The Reading School District is under severe financial stress. In June, 2012, it laid off 110 teachers, 66 teaching assistants, 24 clerical workers, 12 security guards, eight maintenance and custodial workers, seven administrators and six administrative support employees.. The district increased class size and closed one under enrolled elementary school.[122][123] In 2009, the district opened four sixth grade magnet schools – Communications and Technology, Agriculture, Science and Ecology, Business and World Languages, and Performing Arts. The schools were abolished at the end of the 2011-12 school year. Sixth graders were moved to the middle schools.

We also have absolutely awful literacy, dropout rates, etc.

This would probably make a much simpler way of keeping time and would be easier for all ages to comprehend i'd think."

My fiance is my best friend. We have fun together, we have the same sense of humor, we feel strongly about the same political things.

I wasn't worried about cheating. I've never been worried about cheating. I've been in a decent number of relationships at this point in my life, and I'm good at being honest with myself about what I want, and about what's realistic in a situation.

ixAp0c,modelmakers,1390786093.0,"Study the guide and figure out a building process.  It's good to build the wheels, suspension and lower hull, upper hull, and turret, leaving the tracks for last.  

I like to assemble the wheels and leave them off until I put the tracks on.  It's easier to paint and weather everything if you leave the pieces separate and unglued as long as possible. Then I do the suspension, and then the upper hull and turret.  I usually add the pieces that will be painted the same color as the tank on, like the armor plates and armored windows the crew looks out of, etc., and leave smaller bits like shovels and tools off for last.  

Once everything is painted, dry brushing and washing are good techniques to bring out detail.  

And study the decal and paint scheme too, you don't want to rush construction and glue a part on that you need to put a decal behind. 

For decals a gloss coat should be applied before putting the decal on, as the flat paints usually used on AFVs have a matte finish, which is microscopically rough and causes the decals to bubble / deform.  Once you apply the decals over the gloss coat (let gloss coat dry for at least 24 hours), you can spray a matte finish over the model to give it a more dull finish, which is desirable for AFVs.  

Tamiya carries weathering kits that are between oil pastels and pigments, that can simulate realistic weathering effects quite easily, compared to a ton of layers of washes.  The Tamiya Weathering Master A and B kits are good for tanks.  The A kit has two tones of sand and mud, while the B kit has soot, snow, and rust. "

ibbity,AskReddit,1390786171.0,"You are *literally incapable* of understanding context, aren't you? 

His explanation of the history of rape, and of the way it used to be viewed, with which he agrees:

&gt;a woman did indeed have the right to refuse the sexual advances of any man not her husband. But this was only because she was not understood to have any moral right to accept a proposal of fornication or adultery (even in the absence of legal sanctions therefore).The reason rape was regarded as a particularly odious form of assault is
that it violated this superpersonal moral principle by which a woman subordinated her momentary private desires to the wellbeing of those closest to her. Modesty had to be respected, or else protected, if it was to perform its essential social function of guarding the integrity of families...In later European law it was made criminal to rape even prostitutes. But this does not mean that the concept of rape had been divorced from that of feminine modesty; it was rather that law came to recognize and protect the possibility of repentance for immodesty.

His claims about the origins of modern definition of rape:

&gt;The feminists approve the notion of a right to do as one
pleases without responsibilities toward others; they merely insist that only women have this right. Looking about them for some legal and moral basis for enforcing this novel claim, they hit upon the age-old prohibition against rape. Feminists understand rape, however, not as a violation of a woman’s chastity or marital fidelity, but of her merely personal wishes...But mere disregard of a woman’s personal wishes is manifestly not the reason men have been disgraced, imprisoned, in some societies even put to death for the crime of rape...Feminists claim rape is not taken seriously enough; perhaps it would be better to ask how it could be taken seriously at all once we begin defining it as they do...

His claims about ""date rape"":

&gt;The date rape issue can be solved overnight by restoring shotgun
marriage—but with the shotgun at the woman’s back. The “victim” should be told to get into the kitchen and fix supper for her new lord and master...after the birth of her child, the woman will have
more important things to worry about than whether the act by which she conceived it accorded with some women’s studies professor’s newfangled notion of “true consent”...This cultivated and socially
reinforced sexual self-control was known as modesty. It required chiefly the duty of chastity before marriage and fidelity within marriage; secondarily, it involved maintaining a certain demeanor toward men—polite but reserved...Indeed, the date rape campaign owes its success only to the lingering effect of older views...One might have more sympathy for the “date rape victims” if they wanted the men to marry them, feared they were ruined for other suitors, and were prepared to assume their own obligations as wives and mothers. But this is simply not the case. The date rape campaigners, if not the confused young women themselves, are hostile to the very idea of matrimony, and never propose it as a solution. They want to jail men, not make responsible husbands
of them...Indeed, the only people profi ting from the imposition of the new standards are the feminists who invented them. The survival of their movement depends on a continuing supply of resentful women who believe their rights are being violated...The agitators *wanted*
as many young women as possible accusing unsuccessful suitors of wrongdoing.

Allow me to summarize what I have quoted here. 

His view on rape: It was and should be defined as the violation, NOT of a woman's will or consent, but of the ""modesty"" that makes her body the property of another man. A woman's wishes in the matter are irrelevant, because whether she was raped or not is NOT in any way related to whether she wanted to have sex or whether it was forced on her, but whether those to whom she owes ""modesty"" are offended.

His view on ""date rape"": It is a conspiracy by feminists to perpetuate their movement by destroying the family. Feminists are encouraging women to view rape as sex that they are forced or coerced into against their will. As we have seen, he considers this a false definition; he believes that feminists are encouraging false rape claims under the name of ""date rape."" Only feminists define rape as the violation of a woman's ""merely personal wishes,"" and he considers this teaching to be a lie and to result in false claims of ""date rape,"" because it replaces the ""real"" definition of rape (damaged ""modesty."") He believes that the proper response to damaged ""modesty"" is to force the woman to marry that man, and considers this a solution to women thinking about the fact that they were sexed without consent, and to the ""date rape"" that he considers invalid and false. 

Now, let's get to the ""date rape as retroactively regretted sex"" part. He *names* ""retroactively regretted sex"" as ""date rape,"" but he is very careful to outline an extremely specific scenario that he claims is the ONLY thing that is EVER called date rape: A woman having consensual sex and regretting it. Having claimed that this is THE definition of ""date rape,"" he then claims that there is a conspiracy by feminists to get young women to falsely claim date rape on young men with whom they had consensual, retroactively regretted sex. He describes sex as either rape or not rape---he does not mention any kind of gray area. We can therefore assume that he considers sex to either be rape, or not be rape, and that if sex IS rape, then a claim of rape would be valid, but if it was NOT rape, then a claim of rape would be false and would fall under the heading of ""consensual sex later regretted aka date rape."" The definition of ""rape as sex against a woman's will"" completely invalidates, by the author's lights, the validity of rape being defined as anything at all. Since we already know that he considers sex against a woman's will NOT to be rape unless it ALSO falls under the definition of damaged ""modesty,"" a woman who was forced into sex against her will, but in a social context where rape is NOT defined as damaged ""modesty,"" is by his definition NOT A RAPE VICTIM, and is therefore crying DATE RAPE, and should be FORCED TO MARRY HER RAPIST.

Additionally, once Skills began using their center rotating stage, floor space became even more limited. I honestly don't mind the limited floor access because it means that if you do get on the floor then you can dance safely and freely! You aren't gonna be stepping on toes, and you aren't gonna feel like you can't breathe. I think those who complain about not being able to get on the floor are just super butt hurt. "

As the slide moves back the empty casing is dragged over some sort of protuberance to eject it, and part of the slide moves over the hammer to re-cock it.  As the slide moves forward again, usually through spring-power, it slots another round into place, and finally, as long as the trigger is still depressed, the hammer is released and the firing pin strikes the fresh round, starting the process over again.

SPDSKTR,cars,1390786486.0,"First and foremost, you have to know what kind of bulb you require.  When you determine which bulb your headlights use, pick yourself up a plug-and-play HID kit in the type of bulb your headlights require.  If it's an H7, get an H7 kit.  If it's a 9006, get a 9006 kit.

For the most cost-efficient route, pick up an HID kit from DDM Tuning ($30 for a 35W system).  It's a very easy to install plug-and-play system.  For a bit more light, get their 55W kits.  The downside to DDM Tuning's kits is that they take about 30 seconds to get to full power, but come on... they're $30!

If you want a higher quality kit (that's also plug-and-play), go to [The Retrofit Source's HID kit website](http://www.theretrofitsource.com/hid-systems.html?___store=trsdefaultview) and pick up a Morimoto kit.

angelsambition,entp,1390786511.0,"I've been wanting to try shrooms for awhile now but so far I've only tried LSD.

The first time I tried it we were camping in the mountains and it was incredible. We woke up at 4 am so that we could catch the sunrise. Light is so fascinating especially the way it reflects off of snow. Me and my friend stared at snow, played with flashlights and glow sticks and hiked around. After it got light we hiked/bouldered up the edge of a cliff and just sat up there basking in the greatness of creation and listening to music. Let me just say Sigur Ros was a great choice. I felt like I could understand exactly what they were trying to communicate through the music.

The second time I tripped we hung out in denver all day and I had my camera so it was fantastic. On the come up we were on the train into denver and I was taking pictures of us. As we got closer to denver I started just taking pictures of random people on the train. I was trying to be discreet but I honestly wish I hadn't. People are so fascinating. I felt very inspired to start street photographing like Brandon Stanton (Humans of New York guy). 


But the first place we went was the aquarium. To be honest the people were the most interesting part. I was peaking in the very crowded aquarium just looking at people. Also the jellyfish were awesome. We were all relieved to finally get out of the aquarium though.

We then just walked around Denver for a bit (I did a whole lot of people watching) until we found the Denver Contemporary Art Museum. The art in there was so incredible I can't even begin to describe it. I highly recommend an art museum while tripping. On the roof of the museum there was a very cool cafe/bar and rooftop garden. It was only about 4 floors up but the view was incredible. 

When we finally left we honestly just breathed in the city. We walked around and tasted different root beers and exotic saltwater taffy. We went in cool shops and an amazing bookstore. The people were so cool I wanted to talk to all of them and just listen to their life story. I'm looking forward to more trips! In the future I'm going to try to photograph more and better. And talk to more people. People are so damn cool."

They're mobile and strong. They force you to have all these little puzzle pieces fit together in your army so that all your bases are covered, but you win if both armies just a-move into each other. You are now the ""bio"" player. You have to use speed to get around his army, make strikes at his production/gas lines, and wear his army down through attrition. Keep him honest with well-timed (relative to his army composition) tech switches. Don't let him build and army and tech for free. Above all, do not play passive. **Do not play passive.**  
  
(Edit) My Terran friend (crazy, right?) was getting coached once, and he told me something his coach said that I feel applies here. Draw a line through the middle of the map (mentally, please don't scar your computer screen!) You should be on the other side of that line, attacking your enemy for as much of the game as possible. I can't stress enough how important it is to delay a meching Terran for as long as possible before he moves out.  Also, wall your bases in and place 1-3 cannons in each to stop Hellion runbys. I generally leave 1 gap in which I place a Stalker (Armored, not Light, so Blue Flame can suck it) to stop Hellions from roasting all my workers. Obligatory - Do not play passive.  (/Edit)
  
This is generally how I deal with mech. Scouting mech means I can freely take my 3rd. Every time Terran expands, I expand to stay a base ahead. Harassing with a WP is essential. Only drop zealots, as you're going to be floating minerals when fighting mech. Don't invest gas unless you're doing storm drops before he can set up turret rings and vikings. Do not play passive.
  
Start out with double robo. Pump out those immortals and observers so you can see exactly where his army is and what he's trying to do. Mobility is mech's crutch. You have to engage him and slowly give ground, while trading effectively, until you can circumvent his forces and destroy his economy, or flank his army and crush it. Both end-game armies in most of the games I play look like this:  
  
Terran - Siege Tank/Viking/Hellbat/Raven + Hellion runbys + occasionally Thor  
  
Protoss - Immortal/Archon/Zealot/Void Ray or Tempest + WP drops + Colossus if you can keep the Viking count low or zoned out.  
  
Do not play passive.  
  
Lastly, if you take nothing else from this, please remember...  
  
**Do not play passive.**  
  
Good luck!"

zewm426,anarchyonline,1390786592.0,"&gt; I don't know if they even did their research properly to be aiming an MMO for a pretty young demographic.

I'm fairly certain they were just contracted as the developer by Lego and it's not so much a Funcom original IP (like their other mmos). They have to aim for whatever Lego is paying them to aim for, demographic wise.

&gt; Is there a comment that FC has released that says why they're making this game instead of AO2 

I believe Funcom has made it clear in many interviews that they have no intentions of ever making AO2. [Joystiq article from 2009](http://www.joystiq.com/2009/07/09/funcom-anarchy-online-2-not-in-the-cards-yet/)

Also taking into account that Funcom has downsized, [Kotaku article from 2012](http://kotaku.com/5937080/the-secret-world-developer-lays-off-around-half-its-staff), and shut down some of their offices. Basically Funcom is broke AF and I don't think we'll see AO2 ever. Here is [An additional article about Financial woes](http://kotaku.com/5943281/insider-trading-allegations-bring-more-bad-news-for-funcom-and-the-secret-world).

**Edit**: I just forgot to add that imo, the only way we'll see a sequel to AO would be if someone bought the IP from Funcom and just did it themselves. As long as Funcom has the IP, I doubt we'll see much more from them."

banana-tree,Turkey,1390786635.0,"Yes, intentions and practice can be dissociated WRT authoritarianism as I acknowledged. In fact I just remembered there was a quote from Atatürk complaining that they were running a dictatorial rule (I believe that's the word he uses), saying that should change eventually. So he admits that too, but wants to change it. I can find the quote if you're interested.

Since we're making that distinction from authoritarianism, I think we agree now that 1920-1950 CHP, DP and AKP (and pretty much all other parties that got to rule down the line, really) were all oppressive, right? The gassing, jailing of journalists writers and artists, restriction of press, free speech and protests and overall opression isn't new, it didn't start with AKP (or in 1950 for that matter). It was for blasphemy in one, for hats and letters in another, for all opposition and minorities in all etc.

Free and fair elections make a big difference when it comes to defining a rule as a dictatorship (rule of law and separation of powers too, and that's the blurring of lines that I mentioned). AKP does have dangerous authoritarian tendencies (which they state explicitly as well, with themes of obedience and an alarming leader cult), but their support isn't due to unfair elections. It's mostly for relative success in economy that came with stability after a crisis and outside factors (which is turning around now and will probably hurt them in elections), probably for more accessible healthcare and education, and partly for religious inclinations from the pious electorate."

On that trip, there were two very serious incidents that I would not have been able to prevent that would have been blamed on me. 

First, one of the scouts threw an aerosol can into the fire. No one there was brave enough to fish it out with a stick, so they all ran and hid. It turns out that the Scoutmaster was driving into camp about that time. He pulled up to the campsite, stepped out of his Jeep, and as he walked over to the fire, the can exploded.

My argument is as I said: the body is *complex*. The simple principle you are championing is not. Just like Newton's laws are not all that affect a ball rolling across a table, CICO is not all that affects weight control. The very article I linked to, and the quote I posted, is my source.

mundabit,ChronicPain,1390787050.0,"If the leisure centre has a pool, then swimming in any form is going to be a good activity, the water helps to take pressure off joints and it supports the body as you move. Gently paddle around or go for some slow laps in a stroke that doesn't aggravate your pain, or see if they have water aerobics classes or read up on some water aerobics moves and try them by yourself.

I have a dam that I swim in when its not too cold out, and its the best exercise for me, as I can swim and jog on the spot for hours and not feel sore or tired thanks to the water. I also don;t get my normal exercise-migraine if the water is cooler, and I don;t get an asthma attack for some reason either (maybe because I don;t have to wear a sports bra in the water, I don't know)

I too swear by yoga, But there are a lot of exceptions. You *need* to learn it from a professional, either in a class or one-on-one with a physiotherapist or teacher, because learning a pose wrong can do damage to the body. You also need to learn the right poses for your condition if you want yoga to benefit your pain and not just be an exercise, Again talking to a physio who knows yoga is your best bet with this, But finding classes that are run for seniors is great too because they are focused on low impact, relaxation and mobility.

Pilates is also a good one if you can't find a yoga class. You are less likely to hurt yourself if you try this one alone too, But it doesn't have as much research into it as far as its effects on pain as a practise. Its good exercise and that will off course have positive effects in itself.

It depends on your condition, But cycling is low impact for me, My one rule when finding a new gym is ""Do they have a recumbent bike with no time limit?"" The recumbent bikes wont aggravate my pelvic pain, and at that angle I never get an asthma attack, I can go really slow with the torque down low for a completely pain-free activity, or I can go faster and increase the friction. The bike is good on my knee joints, the treadmill, because the weight I put on my knees is dependant on the torque, so If it hurts, I lower the torque.

If you can't find anything specific, take advantage of any quiet studio spaces to do some stretches or [home cardio](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waPCCrftvQA) in your own time. (this video is an example, I like to find a few like this and pick out the ones that I can do without too much pain) depending on your fitness, condition and pain [isometric exercises](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6ZzRyHHqIM) can be good too.

If your goal is to get fit enough to handle your own body, take advantage of any equipment that uses your own weight as the resistance. Things like squatting frames (a frame that helps you take away some of your weight to allow you to squat) or an assisted pull up machine (a weight system that counter-acts your weight to make pull-ups easier) or stair masters that have a weight setting. I like to use these when I go to a gym because I can not lift my own weight, and one of my fitness goals is to be strong enough to squat properly, pull myself up (just once will suffice) or climb a flight of stairs without a break and an asthma attack.

My closest leisure centre offers ball room dancing classes, and that's an activity I want to try out, It costs money so I haven;t signed up just yet, when thinking about taking classes make sure you hunt down the teacher to ask them directly how they think the class will be on someone with your pain/condition. The teacher running the course has a few people with bad backs and dodgy knees, so she thinks It will be fine for me (fibro).

My leisure centre also has a chess club and a book club, so not an exercise-based activity, but something fun to do and to meet new people and get out of the house. Its good on days when there is just no way I could do anything, But I still want to do something, to show up and have a 'quick match' of chess or what have you."

Like, every time I visit my grandma she makes a comment. Or a teacher of mine would make some comment about how concerned she was for me. There's always that undertone to it...

This is in person though. On the internet it's kind of harsh. I've mentioned being vegan on reddit a few times and I've gotten some know it alls telling me my lifestyle isn't healthy. Actually once this guy straight up said I either had to be taking iron pills, or I was anemic.

It's funny though because most people I mention it to think it's really cool and are interested in it (also saying they don't have the discipline for it, that's an incredibly common one). People also ask me what I eat, and that's definitely a hard one to explain. I'm not preachy though, and I don't get into animal rights issues with other people. I honestly don't care if other people eat meat. 

I think the vegans that experience the most... rudeness(?) are the ones who are ones who openly criticize other peoples' diets, or live someone in the deep south. I love being vegan though. I love the food I eat and I think it's really yummy! I recognize that it's not for most people, and I understand why. To each their own!"

With an abortion, we think differently of a woman who has gotten an abortion because she has vasovagal syncope and a heart murmur and has been told carrying to term will kill her, and a woman who says ""oh... its a boy? I wanted a girl"" Both women might seek abortions, But to many people that second woman is a cold hearted murderer, while that first woman is stuck between a rock and a hard place and acted in self-preservation.

Check to the SRSC gym just across the northern parking lot infront of Wright.

evokk,SkincareAddiction,1390787413.0,"Do you feel as though your new cleanser has improved your skin? 

I ask this because by looking through its ingredients, there are quite a few that are know to be irritating and comedogenic. (You can look through the ingredients yourself and compare them to [this](http://www.sageskincare.com/Articles.asp?ID=255) which will tell you the ingredient's irritancy and comedogenicity rating)

You may want to consider switching over to a more gentle cleanser since your current one seems to be pretty irritating. A more gentle cleanser may also help with the dryness issue you're currently experiencing since your cleanser is stripping your skin of its natural oils (oils aren't necessarily bad!). This sub recommends the following cleansers, seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/cleanser_recs).

If you're happy with your current moisturizer, then I wouldn't switch it up. 

To be honest, your acne is at most moderate and I don't think you should have too much trouble getting rid of it. Acne takes patience, and products need time to take affect (usually at least 3 months to see full effects). I think you could also benefit from adding a BHA and/or AHA exfoliant in your routine down the road, but I think you need to first find a cleanser that works for you :)

It is my understanding that guys get random boners from all sorts of things, but quietly chilling with a hard-on is a whole different realm than rubbing in his sexuality when the gf is about to cry because of being forced into an unpleasant rough sex act and subsequently insulted.

I think it's sweet that your bf feels comfortable enough to confide in you about his weird crying boners later on during a time that is presumably not emotionally sensitive. That's the total opposite of how OP's bf handled things and seems like a much healthier way to deal with tear-spurred arousal."

I had this problem with the brakes on my first bike - a YG1F. Front had a cable of finest over-boiled spaghetti, and the rear had a rod connection which would lock the wheel. 18W headlight, run directly off the engine, not the battery. So I'd charge up to a bend at night, see it at the last moment and slam on the brakes. Front did nothing. Back locked up the tyre (turned from finest Avon bakelite). Which stopped the engine.

When you see a Myotherapist, Physiotherapist and acupuncturist. When you have a psychologist and you take part in regular 'disability friendly' yoga classes and follow your physio's exercise plan to a T, when you are on the weird diets your Rhematologist recommends and you take part on weird meditation rituals your therapist suggests, when 9/10ths of your day is spent going from one mildly relieving activity to another instead of the things you really want to be doing .... My Doctors keep telling me that I need to work on your ""Pain management"" as though its my fault I still hurt. 

It annoys me, But given the list above I feel I'm at the end of hope. They keep saying ""pain management"" and when I ask them to elaborate they say "" a combination of things. Medication, physical therapy, massage, accupuncture..."" and I say ""But I do those things, except medication, but you and I know why that is"" they will reply ""well that's good, keep that up, it will help you a lot"" ..... If it was helping I wouldn't be here complaining that I need more help! Its like this ""pain management"" thing is set in stone 'these things help' and when they don't help doctors wont believe that and they say 'well that's not right, try harder'

I thought I found a good doctor, but she even started doing this to real symptoms. My left breast has been producing milk, but my prolactin level is normal. My Doctor said ""that's not right, You can't have milk with normal level"" and I asked ""so what should I do now?"" and she said ""well its not possible"" and I replied ""ok, but its happening, so, Do I get a mammogram or a CT of my head to check my pituitary?"" and she said ""No, your prolactin is normal, so you can't be lactating, so its ok"" .... Uh. No, its not ok, My boob is leaking, I don;t care if your test said its *not* leaking, I have the wet bra to prove it, you saw it coming out. stop telling me its fine because the test is negative, if anything that makes it not-fine because it means its totally unexplained.

(Convinced her to let me get a mammogram and an ultrasound because ""well what's the harm, it will be good to have a base-line image from when I'm 20 so they can refer to it when I'm 50"", but I shouldn't have to phrase it like that, I should be able to say ""my boob is crying,look inside it"")"

Seems completely understandable that you wouldn't be in the mood after arguing with him to convince him to go down on you. He has a very bad attitude if he assumes it should just be about him. You're partners in a relationship, I'd like to think things should be equal in the bedroom and otherwise; that's how it is with my girlfriend and I.

Sure some relationships may agree on one person dominating, or whatever way you want to put it, but that is dependent on the relationship and is clearly not the case with yours since you are unhappy with his selfishness.

You should discuss this with your boyfriend and hopefully he is willing to be reasonable."

Amj161,pcmasterrace,1390787985.0,"Kind of a weird story, but I had been PC Gaming all my life, but in small forms. As a kid I remember playing City of Heroes, Sins of a Solar Empire, Civilization V, Age of Mythology. Then I also remember later on playing Minecraft, and getting my dad to teach me how to mod Minecraft with the planes mod. My dad actually had a steam account before me to play Civ V, and that was my first exposure to steam. I later got an Xbox because of Halo, and only had around 10 games on it total. I usually played more PC MMOs, sandboxes, or something.

 Then, I heard of gaming PCs. I had no clue what they were besides fancy PCs, but one guy I knew had one with SLI 560TIs. During lunch and study hall he taught me about motherboards, graphics cards, processors, basically taught me whatever about computers I wanted to learn. Later on, I decided I wanted to build a computer for gaming (mostly because of Star Wars the Old Republic actually, even though the game was bad, I was addicted). I later found Toms Hardware, and saw a guide on how to build a PC for under $1000. It had a i5 2500k, Gigabyte 560ti, Asus P8Z68 PRO/GEN3, Rosewill Challenger case, TX650 watt psu, and I had taken a 500gb hard drive from another desktop that was un-used in our house that had Windows 7 on it. With my dad, he taught me how to put it together piece by piece, and since the case hadnt arrived yet, we had the complete computer set up on top of my motherboard box, sitting there downloading Windows (cause Windows couldn't handle being moved to another motherboard). When the case came, I, with my dads help, put all the components in, and let it run. 

Interestingly enough, I had a steam account, but it wasn't activated for months. Because all I didn't anything with my PC besides play Star Wars the Old Republic and Minecraft, and occasionally browsing the internet (didn't know about reddit then). Later, Steam was doing its regular start on boot thing (I used steam more to communicate with friends than anything else), and it said something about a sale. Interested, I looked at the store page, and was shocked at what I was seeing. I went that day and bought Portal 2. And that started the track to get where I am now."

Russkiy_To_Youskiy,politics,1390788165.0,"As someone who was an executive in a large national restaurant chain for many years, I can tell you that what you're saying is mostly not right, and really more heinous if you really think about it.

As an example, we had many restaurants in Florida when the people of the state of Florida electorally decided to increase the minimum wage for Florida workers. Our CEO, in a quarterly meeting (discussing profits/revenue/etc) stated, in no uncertain terms, that we as a company would **not** absorb the added labor cost and would pass it **directly** to our customers through higher prices. We had a separate pricing tier for Florida (and other areas with higher-than-federal wage laws) which leveraged those prices accordingly. Other industries do exactly that as well, but it might be more subtle or less apparent based on the type of business they are running. 

No one in any mid- to high- level executive position ever really takes their pay into consideration when making these decisions. It's all about  what is considered due diligence, inherent in their position in the company, to the stockholders in regards to growing the business. Almost everyone I encountered in the highest positions (CEOs, CFOs, COOs, etc) basically took their own compensation package for granted. 

That being said, in yearly budget-setting meetings, they would instruct our comptrollers to keep the amount of manager bonus to the lowest amount possible (always lower than the year before), or make the bonus structure so obtuse that no one in the field would be able to figure out how to make any bonus money. They inured to the fact that they would have to pay *something* in bonus only because the restaurant industry competes for the best managers based partly on bonus compensation. So we had to have *something* regarding bonus pay to give to HR to sell the positions to people. If it wasn't for the fact that other companies also pay it, we would have paid *nothing* to managers in bonus compensation.

**tl;dr:** Passing added costs to customers is how most businesses operate to keep a balance sheet clean. But they won't think twice about fucking the people doing the work if they can get away with it."

Noumenology,DepthHub,1390788181.0,"The issue is the anti-intellectualism on behalf of atheists, specifically the ones who disavow any academic or scholarly approach to religion - people who fail to see any value in the study of religion, belief and spirituality. Those efforts are usually (but not always) initiated by people who have an interest in broadening or deepening their own appreciation for belief and spirituality, and the value of that sort of attention and devotion to a subject (which just happens to be religious) aggravates certain sorts of atheists, who are content in their disbelief, and unappreciative of any benefit such study might have on understanding culture or the human condition. I don't mean that such studies reveal a ""truth"" about God, but they reveal truths about people, how they think, what they feel, and what's important to them.

That's why militant atheists are pseudo-intellectuals at best and deserve all the scorn and derision they receive. "

&gt;and searching for hours on a server that's 99% looted for basic gear...

If you're looking for gear then don't play on a 40 man server, and if you are don't go to elektro or kammy and expect to find anything. I don't care how full a server is, there is ALWAYS gear in cherno/berizino and up. It's not hard to get fucking geared dude, join a low pop server, run to a big town, bam you have everything you need within 30 minutes of play time. Rifles spawn in schools, pistols in firehourse, and shotguns in houses/restaurants. 

&gt; losing your character to random glitches

You're not losing your character, you're joining unhived servers, theres a really easy fix for that one too, log out, log into a hived sever, BAM your stuff is back. If you have complaints about the game then thats fine but your complaints are pretty much whinny bullshit from some one who A) played the game once or twice and complains about shit that is irrelevant to current SA or B) doesn't understand loot spawns and that elektro is deathmatch city.

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1390788561.0,"&gt;Ok, but in my own, lived experience, the sexual attention I got did not translate into a broader experience of friendship and inclusion. There weren't usually any people (definitely no women) coming up to me trying to get me to like them, be their friend, hang out with them, go to this cool concert they thought I'd enjoy, etc. If these things happened to me in my socially awkward phase, it was from guys who had a specific goal in mind and made that clear. The sexual market value thing didn't make me popular or liked in any real way.

&gt;I think that the number thing is a much better analogy for perceived coolness. Appearance does factor into that, but there is a lot more going on. I've tried to figure it out myself and it seems to mostly boil down to confidence in oneself. People want to be friends/lovers/hangers-on with people who are cool and super social. Attractiveness helps people perceive you in that way to some extent, but if they then see that you're awkward, quiet, keep to yourself, and have a bunch of other traits that are NOT cool, your looks aren't enough.

I would say the range of freedom you are given to express yourself and make social bumbles is radically higher. I'm not arguing that being hot means you can play the game, but it certainly gets you on the field for a prolonged period of time, and that's more then enough. 

You really sound more like a special case, than of a defender of ""hot people have problems too"". I think if you didn't have whatever social hangs up you had/have, an attractive person would have to wake up in the morning and put a concerted effort into failling socially to have no friends. I mean shit, most female to male friendships are simply failed courtships. Men and women rarely talk to each other if attraction from one party is not present and they are not mandated to socialize due to work or educational restraints.

Add that to the fact that attractive people who have, more or less, always been attractive, have literally a decade+ of experience on others on dealing with high social/sexual value. "

We have family members in your same boat. We've talked about, if our kids are striking, or quite good looking, keeping them in bad haircuts.

If it helps at all, I think there a many more ways than just being good looking that affect how people interact with each other. And people use these things to our advantage, and many aren't considered to be 'bad.' 

For example, I use, quite frequently and don't feel shame for it at all,  the fact that I am small and non-threatening seeming.  I use this to moving around quickly through crowded places without upsetting people, to get people to open up to me, to persuade people of things.  And I think most people are fine with this, and don't resent it, because it also has it drawback: I am small and vulnerable, and bad things could easily happen to me.

Being good looking has had this draw back for you.  Don't feel horrible about using it also to your benefit. If it were intelligence, or athleticism, would you feel the same way?

I don't mean that you have to run around schmoozing every person you see. But using it like you would any natural gift seems fine to me."

visenya42,relationships,1390788860.0,"I have had a similar family situation develop over the last year. My father comes from a background of abuse, my mother is extremely paranoid, controlling, and self-centered; and I was also diagnosed with Asperger's last year, the same month as my parents divorced. (I am 20F). I am the primary caregiver for my sister (15F) as my mom has a new boyfriend and developed habits such as coloring her hair, drinking, going out, etc. 
My best advice to you is to discuss issues like this with a licensed therapist or psychiatrist. 
Talking to a therapist helped me develop a framework for putting my emotions into words and trying to repair my relationship with my mother, though I eventually had to move colleges across the country for my mental health. 
I am not sure if this is how it is for you, but I know these issues for me are compounded by asperger's related anxiety. If you do look for a psychiatrist/therapist, make sure you disclose to them if you're comfortable so they can help you get some coping techniques. 
And for me yes, my mother is the main stress factor in my life, so it's entirely possible your stress is being caused by your mother. Living in a toxic home like you've described is unexpectedly difficult. After moving across the country, I have been much more confident, happy, and just comfortable in my own skin. 
If you want to ask me any questions or just want someone to talk to please PM me!

mundabit,ChronicPain,1390789135.0,"As a kid I didn't call it pain. Scraping my knee was pain, Bumping my head was pain. But my mother recalls, my diary reads and my medical records show that I complained of 'sensations' likes being itchy or hot or tingly, and I  *always* had the flu, there are like 3 weeks out of every year where my medical records don't read that I had a flu or cold. 

I can trace my use of the word 'pain' in the chronic sense to when I was 9 and started my period. I didn't stop bleeding until I was put on BC, so for a few years I had cramps every single day, Since then pain was easily recognisable, I got migraines, I got joint pain. I started seeing a physio at 12 years old, I saw them once a week, I started seeing a Myo at 14, I started getting acupuncture at 15. My Mother is a woo-woo homoeopathic nut job, so It was tough convincing her that I  needed physio more than I needed Amethyst necklaces. 

But when it came to my period she was all sience, I saw my fisrt GYN at 10 years old, and I see one every other month since, trying to find one who will care that my vagina was flowing blood as thought it was a second heart. they all said that I would grow out of it, or that having a baby will fix it. I definitely felt that my young age was getting in the way of real treatment. My Mum had the same symptoms but at 40 they didn't hesitate to just dive in and rip organs our and burn other organs off and throw her on every medication known to man. My mum had to beg with my paediatrician to get me onto some BC as a kid. It really helped and I'm so thankful she did, It made my teen years tollerable.

Now that I'm 20 that front is moving quickly. I can lie and pretend that fertility is an issue to get doctors to listen to me. They don;t care that I am in pain, but they do care that I can't have babies. Its bullshit, but at least I'm getting the surgury I  need.

But the joint pain, migraines and 'constant flu pain' is still a bother. I've had very little testing done and I've been told its fibromyalgia, which us fine, but there is no medication that really helps with that, I was on a TCA for it but it did nothing. (though side note; it cured my vulvodynia!) and I've been told that's it. I know that's not it, I know there are other things like pregabalin and duloxetine that I could try, but when I ask my doctors say ""those are last-resort drugs"" and I have to wonder when is the last resort, this will be my 12th year of confirmed chronic pain, potentially my 22nd year of having fibro if the sensations and flu I had as a kid were warning signs. When is it a last resort. Do I have to wait till I am 50 and still in pain?  I'm not asking for narcotics or anything serious like that, I'm actually not even asking for drugs at all, I'm asking for the opportunity to try the pain relief methods that have worked for others, regardless of my age."

fnredditacct,AskReddit,1390789204.0,"I'd go to a clinic. You should be able to get the works for free.

Planned parenthood I don't think is free, at least it's not where I live. The county health department is though.

I think you should probably wait a week, (or is it two?), before getting tested. I know that if you go tomorrow, it probably won't be enough time for your body to produce anti-bodies enough to show up on the tests.

Also, in 6 months you'll need to do an HIV test. I suppose, as long as it's free, doing one with the rest can't hurt, but I'm pretty sure it can take 6 months to show up in your system.

I think saying ""test me for all STDs you have tests for"" will be a good place to start, but I know that HSV (herpes) you need to ask specifically for.

Tests to get:
Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Trich, Syphilis, HepB, HepC, HSV, HIV, HPV (if they are doing this for guys now, haven't asked recently)

Make sure you use protection, at least for the sake of future partners, especially between now and when you find out.

Good luck!"

The diagnosis may only be helpful in that there's a specific way to deal with that particular personality type. It's like a very helpful adjective, but I guess that's enough. As I think about it more and more, BPD raises a lot of philosophical issues on what identity is, and it sheds light on how a person's temperament/character originates."

It's too bad that any meaningful discussion gets ruined on Reddit by an arbitrary down vote system that rewards lazy people by allowing them to dictate who sees the topic without having to defend their point of view. 

Thank you for putting thought into your post.

What I see here is just a simple tale of two set ups. My house is not set up in a fashion that would make having the computer near the TV feasible. For me to game on my PC it requires me to be in the back room away from everything else which is not always a bad thing, but does conflict with my life style. My wife and I both work full time.

 I don't get to spend much time with her during the week, so when I do I don't like to hide out in the back room. I get your wife not being a gamer. Mine is not much of a gamer either. 

The point of my post wasn't to compare who has a better gaming set up. It was more to point out that we all have a different opinion on what type of gaming we prefer. When I read through the comments in this sub and all I see is, ""Get a PC"", ""It's better on PC"" constantly its to the point of absurdity. I see plenty of worthwhile discussions that devolve into arguments about what gaming medium is better. Most of the time its off topic, and not helpful.

The temples are filling in, but still have more of a male pattern, but if I part in the middle I look like a have a feminine widow's peak. It is still thickening in the front, and from what I've been told, it will continue improve for up to 9 more months.

noname725,actuallesbians,1390789577.0,"Yeah, I definitely have mixed feelings about The L Word. I watched it for the first time during probably the height of my coming to terms with my sexuality and it did kind of help, to be honest. I do think that the first couple of seasons were pretty good and I enjoyed many of the episodes and characters, but it really started going downhill at some point and there were some serious problems with the show throughout.

The L Word depicts only a very narrow group of people. Most of them are white. Most of them are cis lesbians. They seem to be pretty wealthy. They have a lot of time and they have the means to go out almost every night. They're all classically attractive (and pretty much all are quite femme). It takes place on the West Coast. This represents just one very small fraction of people. Sure, there were some people of color on the show and I certainly don't want to neglect them, but the show *mostly* focused on its white characters. Sure, there were some trans* characters, but they weren't always handled with respect. 

The show had a lot of transphobia and biphobia. Most of the storylines surrounding Max weren't very well done, and I felt like there was a lot of unchecked transphobia. There weren't many bisexual characters and they weren't treated very well. As time went on, they seemed to pretty much forget that Alice was ever bisexual. I get that it's the ""L"" word, but I just felt like they could've been kinder toward bisexuals. Early on, Alice's bisexuality was often the punchline to a joke or seen as ""gross,"" and while there certainly are some people who think that way, it isn't exactly a healthy or fair line of thinking to promote, you know? Maybe I'm ranting a bit since this is personal to me as a bisexual person, but it sucks sometimes feeling like you never really fit in anywhere.

I enjoy a lot of aspects of the show and I do kind of cling to it because it's one of the few shows we queer ladies have, but it's far from perfect. I wish that there were more shows out there for us...and you'd think there would be by now. Hopefully there will be more in the near future and hopefully they will improve upon some of The L Word's failings."

The reason we fell-out is that after cycles of trying to pull away from them, I went on a trip to kill myself, and on the first day made it so my friend basically took the blame for it with her own words, when I came back she wouldn't talk to me even though I was sleeping at her place, taking care of her dogs, and working with her a few weeks prior.


Even though we shared our most intimate secrets, had a key to her house, had invested in her company and worked together, I always thought there was more to her, and that she and her best friend of 10 years was hiding something, and almost everyone else who knew them suspected them of mildly nefarious activities.

This is why it's advisable to do Blackmarsh last. In order to make your companions do the Joining, you have to speak to the Seneschal. The companion you find in the Blackmarsh is already a Warden, and doesn't need to do the ceremony. However, it's not the end of the world if you want to recruit in a different order--some people might like to see the Blackmarsh companion earlier, since he (and Anders) play a large role in Dragon Age 2.

Takuya-san,australia,1390789874.0,"&gt;Does he deserve to pay taxes to fund a slightly cleaner earth for children he doesn't know and will never have; for people he might loathe?

I've never heard a more moronic statement in my entire life. Yes, he does. Because that's how a society works, dickwad. Money I've paid in taxes has helped to pay for pathetic lifeforms like you, too. Let's put it the other way around.

First let's look at health. Say you're diagnosed with cancer. Does society ""deserve"" to pay for you, or should you be forced into a situation of trying to fork out $100k?

Now let's look at crime. Let's say a criminal gang moves into your neighbourhood and starts robbing places. Does society ""deserve"" to pay for police?

The whole point of paying taxes for the government to provide services and funding to things is so that society as a whole is more secure. Maybe you don't get as much benefit from government services as the average person. Guess what? You do it anyway, because some day you might end up being far above the average. It's similar to paying insurance.

&gt;sacrifice their lifestyles 

Because funding renewable energy means sacrificing all of your livable income? Fuck off, over-dramatic wanker. The amount you'd have to pay for this could range from a few dollars per year if you're low income to less than a hundred per year if you're high income (and let's face it, that won't affect your lifestyle if you're high income single with no relatives)."

Yes, we should come together as one. We shouldn't like the idea of denominations. But there are very real divisions in the Body of Christ that cannot be overcome simply by saying that we want to be one. We should all pray for and work towards unity, but it must be a true unity in Christ and not something contrived.

As for being Catholic, I say as a Catholic that if you believe that the truth lies in the Catholic Church and you are willing to follow Christ into it, then it is where you should go. There may be teachings or practices that are difficult to accept along the way, so be prepared to be challenged by God. If you like to read, the *Catechism of the Catholic Church* is the best resource on what the Catholic Church teaches. You can also attend more Masses or step into an adoration chapel to pray about it, or you can look for information in the parish bulletin on faith formation classes or RCIA (conversion classes)."

For example, I think the lack of acceptance for boys and men to be emotional and sensitive is every bit as upsetting as lack of acceptance for girls and women to be analytical and calculating.

Gender identity can be a really tricky thing.  I think that it would be best if we could all step back, see the individual first and gender second.

But even doing this doesn't fix issues women have because women have women parts, or issues men have because men have men parts.

It doesn't have to be about ""who has it worse"" or ""whose problems are more important.""

It'd be great if we could say to each other, ""Huh, that sounds like a hard thing to deal with. How do *you* think it could be made better?"" And then actually listen."

xanderharris_,AskReddit,1390790290.0,"When I was in fifth grade I had a giant crush on the cutest boy in the class. His name was Ian. One day our table was talking about gel pens (this was the ""in"" thing) and he said he wanted a blue one. I said he could have mine. Unfortunately I didn't have a blue gel pen, so that night I forced my mom to take me to the neighborhood store to buy one so I could give it to him. So we go to the store, I find the perfect gel pen and we head to the register to check out. Guess who we ran into on the way? Ian. The sad part is that I don't even think he noticed, and he barely cared when I gave it to him the next day because he clearly did not have the same feelings towards me that I had for him. He went on to be the cutest boy in our middle school and arguably the cutest boy in our high school as well. I had many classes with him over the years and my crush didn't totally fade, but I don't think he ever really noticed me :(

People need to accept that even if you know a certain truth, there will always be those who call you a social heretic because you are challenging the current paradigm. Remember, even minds like Galileo were marginalized because people had bought into what rome was selling at the time. We live in different times, and your job is to present a compelling enough logical argument to convince the nay sayers of what you're trying to prove. I believe that people using ad hominem attacks by calling anyone who disagrees with them shills are in the process of learning this. You'll lose some arguments that way, but if you know something to be true and can't find the words convincing enough to win the argument, you'll dust yourself off, do some research and come back smarter and more equipped to defend your position.

Irate_Rater,running,1390790564.0,"[Kids threw rotten fruit at me while I ran!](http://imgur.com/pGQRuVx)

It's not that hard to fake.

This kind of thing happens, but EXTREMELY rarely. I've been running for several years, and run ~70 miles/week all of it outdoors, (Though, to be fair, some of my weekly mileage is on a track where the people can't really throw things at you, so I'd say about 60mpw of actual area where people could hit me.) and have had **one** incident where people have thrown something at me. She has been running ~17 miles/week for about 4.5 months, a good portion of it, according to her blog, on a treadmill, so the miles where she could actually get hit are closer to about ~10mpw. 

So if a veteran runner who is out there 60 miles/week for several years has had only one occurrence of this, the chance of this happening is about once in ever 20160 miles (60 miles/week x 48 weeks of running per year [2 week break after spring/fall seasons] x 7 years of running = 20160 estimated lifetime off-track miles)

She experienced it once in 370 miles. Assuming we both live in similar areas, there's about about a 1.8% chance that that would happen. or a 98.2% chance that it never happened. 

Now this is obviously a very rough estimation and it's inherently flawed because my mile time is faster than hers therefore I'm on the street for a lesser amount of time per mile, and am exposed to fewer opportunities for people to throw stuff at me. 

Also, before you accuse someone of lying, be sure to check [their post history, to make sure their top post isn't about this same topic on this same subreddit from 7 months ago](http://a0.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1fzd9y/today_i_dodged_a_water_balloon_has_anyone_ever/)"

brotherbock,triathlon,1390790818.0,"So, to be clear, your position--that sheer numbers of calories taken in and expended are ALL that affect weight gain or loss--is something you claim has not been proven.

It's also a position that specifically denies the following claims:

1) That foods eaten at different times will have different effects on the body. For example, it's believed by the general run of nutritionists and exercise scientists that 'recovery calories' after exercise are beneficial to muscle recovery and growth. Specifically, a 4:1 ratio of carbs to protein taken in within an hour of strenuous exercise has a much more significant effect on muscle recovery and growth than those same calories taken in after that window. Muscle growth vs other calorie usage will have an effect on weight. Your position would deny this.

2) It's commonly recommended that people avoid eating after certain times of night, and avoid eating certain sorts of foods after different times. This is for a variety of reasons, but weight is one. Your position would deny this.

3) That some types of calories are 'better' for you than others. Your position would carry the corollary that all calories from all sources have an equal effect on the body.

Thus, your position would necessarily lead to the conclusion that two people who expend the same calories throughout every day of their lives would have the same weights, even if one ate nothing but snickers bars and the other ate the same number of calories from some sort of 'balanced' diet of reasonable amounts of various kinds of nutrients. *This is what your position leads to.*


Regarding your links, the first is a study showing that a particular kind of fad diet is not effective. Hardly proof for your very strong claim that amounts of calories are all that matters. Your second link shows that participants who ate *uncontrolled* amounts of food (their usual meals) lost weight when they were restricted to a specific portion size of food...thus illustrating that many of us eat way too damn much, and not leading in any way to your claim. Your third link is a study which showed that three particular physiological factors, three particular ones, were not predictive in the study. A study in which the researchers, as good researchers, admit that ""Behavioral factors may have outweighed physiological signals for determining successful weight loss."" I.E. that physiological factors may play a role, but may be outweighed in many people by behavior.

The thing about science is that a study like that is taken to be *no more indicative of large sale claims like yours* than the specific study limitations. They studied *three factors* (adiposity, satiety/hunger, and inflammation). Just how many factors do you think play a role in something as complex as *human behavior* and human physiology?

So when you say that your studies show that ""other factors"" don't affect weight loss, what you need to make sure you're saying is that ""a small number of specific factors"" were found to...etc etc.


But what you are saying is that the numbers are all that matter. Calories (which are measured in food laboratories by literally setting fire to things, a process unlike what happens in the human body), the amount, are all that matters...that's your claim. And my claim is that it is but one of many factors that determine weight. Your position is that no other factors in the entire universe affect weight loss. Not much more I can say at this point.

If you want to continue to believe that, that's fine. And you may get some confirmation bias--it may seem to work for you. You may measure your food calories, and measure your exercise calories, and hit a perceived deficit, and see success. My claim is that you see success because of the coordination of that factor plus a whole host of other factors you are not measuring. 

It's like shooting at a target with a rifle, hitting the target, and saying ""See, my aim is all that matters. Wind and gravity have no effect"" because you happened to hit it.

I am honestly super busy at the moment, so this is all the time I've got for this. Anyone bothering to follow along, and you, can believe what you want. Other than disliking it when I see 'bad science' tossed around, I have no dog in the hunt.

Peace.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390790846.0,"&gt;No, it is the measure that the government, and almost everyone else, uses because you can't have meaningful conversations without standards of measurement.

And test scores are an awful measurement a lot of the time. There's a reason some colleges are dropping the SATs from admissions requirements, for instance. You've also apparently never heard of the problem schools have been facing since NCLB where teachers teach to the test rather than actually encouraging real learning. So people have inflated scores on these arbitrary measures while in reality, they don't know much.

&gt;No, you live in an area that has had budget cuts. whether or not those cuts have had any effect on actual received education by students is an entirely separate question. Unfortunately, this is a concept you don't seem to understand, and I don't know how to make it any simpler than I already have.

Except I already explained the situation and you handwaved it to talk about test scores.

When they lay off teachers and more people are herded into larger and larger class rooms, don't you think that has an impact on the students' ability to learn and the teachers' ability to teach?

When you cut a bunch of programs like tutoring aimed at helping students learn, don't you think that hurts them? Or are you going to keep pushing ONE MEASURE while ignoring facts like this that don't help your narrative?

Pointing to NAEP scores for the state of our education system is a lot like pointing to the stock market or GDP and trying to sum up the entire economy based on such figures. Sure, you measure how things SEEM to be doing overall, but such broad measures don't necessarily reflect the nuance of reality.

LordXerces,relationships,1390791254.0,"It depends on what type of relationship you had. I'll go out on a limb and say ""tell her"". If she freaks out because of it and feels like she cannot be your friend anymore, then she never really cared *that much*. The thing is, you will always have difficulty being her friend, because you've been together for three years, and you still love her even after all of that, and you are definitely still very attracted to her. But you also need to remember why you broke up in the first place, and if that story is something you would like to relive. Some things happen for a reason, and what you are going through might just be the case of a broken heart, your mental addiction to being with her, and the insatiable fear of being alone and not finding anything like her ever again.  
  
A relationship is like two chemical mixed together. The people are chemicals, and the relationship is the vial that you go into. Although you might feel like you've changed, when you mix two chemicals time and time again, you will always see the same result. The only exception to this is if many years have passed, because everyone changes eventually."

""This is how the world is, Ron. This is the kind of cruelty we are all familiar with. Let me tell you of the Broken Shackle Pirates.""  
  
*Orville continues building the wall with Albert's help, pointing out stones that need shaping and doing some shaping with his bare hands.*  
  
""I was born a slave. I lived all 21 years of my life, in a mine underground, the property of a nobleman. I was considered less than human, a beast of burden, and whenever I attempted to stand up for myself or protect another slave, I was beaten and tortured. I finally escaped that life, but it took the slaughter of three dozen slave drivers and an entire Marine ship to do so. I have been a free man for less than a week.""  
  
*Orville takes the saw out of his toolbelt and starts sawing the boulders he pulls up, cutting through them as if they were wood. He tilts his hand in Albert's direction.*  
  
""Albert's home island has for some time been taken over by pirates and a corrupt group of Marines. They abuse their power and take advantage of the townspeople, oppressing them. Albert came out into the world to find help, and when we are done on this island and obtain a ship, we will be heading there to liberate his home.""  
  
*The wall now surrounds one quarter of the well. Orville grabs the iron cane, which he is now storing in his toolbelt where he once kept a hammer, and smacks the wall with it, testing the wall's strength. It shakes a bit, and he begins packing it with dirt.*  
  
""The crew's first mate, Minok, is a fishman. Like myself, he was a slave, and it took him time to break free. For reasons I do not wish to understand, humans are so very cruel to the fishman race, and Minok wishes to liberate his people, a goal I plan to help him with. Our navigator, Angus, is a former noble, who lost his station when he tried helping some citizens poorer than he.""  
  
*Orville starts tapping the wall again with the cane, this time satisfied with the results.*  
  
""This is a cruel world, full of terrible people. There are those in power who abuse it, who oppress those they consider beneath themselves and make the lives of others horrible so they may make their already pleasure-filled lives even more pleasurable. The entire World Government is riddled with corruption, with nobles who may own and abuse other human beings, Marines who use their power to oppress people instead of protect them, and evil pirates who take what they want and hurt others on a whim, such as the Warlord's crew. The existence of the Seven Warlords of the Sea is corruption in itself, taking some of the world's most powerful and evil men and protecting their actions. But there is still hope.""  
  
*Orville pulls more stone from the ground and starts hacking it up into more manageable pieces with the saw, working with Albert to continue building the wall.*  
  
""Our crew's doctor, Yasaki, found his home under siege one day. He was saved not by Marines, the so-called envoys of justice, but by a single swordsman, a champion with an emerald blade. This is our goal.""  
  
*Orville starts stacking stones together with Albert.*  
  
""The Broken Shackle Pirates fight oppression. We protect those who cannot protect themselves, and we will destroy the corrupt ruling system that allows for those with power to take advantage of those without it. We will make all men free. It will not be an easy fight, and the world will brand us as villains and monsters, but we will go to the Holy Land at the top of the world, and we will toss them all into the abyss, where they can no longer hide behind status.""  
  
*Orville turns to Ron.*

JAStars102,harvestmoon,1390791361.0,"I generally don't like the handheld games due to being over-complicated (A New Beginning actually made it tolerable).

However, if it counts, my least Favorite Harvest Moon game is Harvest Moon My Little Shop for the WiiWare.  It relies on real-time issues, there is no dating since your character is a child, and it is generally a waste of time.

If I had to pick one of the main series games, It would either be IoH (or SI, since they were exactly the same) or DS/Cute.

I dislike IoH and SI for the same reasons as everyone else who has posted it, so I won't repeat what they said.

I dislike DS Cute because it is the perfect example of over-complication.  First, EVERYTHING HAS LEVELS.  I'm used to the tools having different levels, but Cursed, Blessed, and Mythic are just ridiculous.  The Mining was awful due to having to fight evil animals and the levels going on for way too long (past 100 is overkill).  I hated the Bachelors (Sorry AnWL fans, but they're ugly) and tried to court Kai because he was the only decent bachelor.  The Harvest Sprite Casino was way too hard to get anything good.  The Soundtrack sucked so I had to listen to records or just turn off the sound.  The Seeds had levels that weren't influenced with fertilizer.  The buildings had levels and could collapse and kill your life stock.

pat5168,MapPorn,1390791364.0,"You claimed that the Soviet Union declared war on the Allies, which is absolutely not true. Although Britain did make a pact with Poland to declare war on any European invader, there was a secret protocol that stated that it only applied to Germany. France and Britain's non reaction was aided by the fact that most of the French and British saw Soviet claims on the region as reasonable. Also, a declaration of war against the USSR and Germany would have been suicidal and would have only served to strengthen the bonds between the two countries.

Winston Churchill: ""... That the Russian armies should stand on this line was clearly necessary for the safety of Russia against the Nazi menace. At any rate, the line is there, and an Eastern front has been created which Nazi Germany does not dare assail. When Herr von Ribbentrop was summoned to Moscow last week it was to learn the fact, and to accept the fact, that the Nazi designs upon the Baltic States and upon the Ukraine must come to a dead stop."" This clearly shows that the British sympathized with the extension of Soviet control and were probably very happy that it wasn't overtly hostile."

- ...except for paying the insurance company and having them set up recurring payments on the same card. Again. Because credit card security is non-existent anymore. THIS will be done before leaving the apartment on Monday, and then nothing else will be done before things are mailed.
- Clean. In rough order of priority:
    - vacuum living room, dining area, and couch
    - coffee table toys
    - find a better place for the play kitchen
    - stuff on/around fireplace

- ~~finish knit square~~ Done, *including* weaving in the ends. Hot damn!
- ~~put together Lazy Kate and~~ ply the spinning project that has to get done before I can do any other spinning.

- ~~organize either hallway closet or knitting stuff in my room closet. Getting itchy about not having anything super simple to knit on.~~ Did knitting stuff, as well as spinning stuff I had on/in my desk. I now have a super simple knitting project that's just basically something to busy my hands with while holding the baby.

Tuesday:

jojewels92,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1390791422.0,"My favorite teacher growing up was Mrs. Medina, my 5th grade teacher. She was just so kind and understanding but at the same time she was really firm and helped us to succeed. She is literally the only teacher who helped me and was patient with me as far as math goes. The only time in my life that I truly learned and understood math was in her class. She was just fantastic. 

My favorite teacher of all time though is my current Russian professor. She has taught me SO much and explains things in ways that just make sense. She's really cool too. 

Since I am learning Russian I'd really like some simple books to help me out with that.

ANewMachine615,patientgamers,1390791525.0,"I'm really loving the game. The music is much better than in past DMC games (seriously, that one song from 4 was... ugh). Sound effects are about the same. 

As somebody who played the first 4 on Son of Sparda with regularity, and beat DMC 4 on Hell or Hell Mode (Dante has 1 HP, everything else is max difficulty), I gotta say the combat is excellent. Quick-swapping between 5 available weapons leaves a lot of room for variety, and the game often encourages you to use it. Some fights aside (if I never fight a Ghost/Hell Rage again, I'll be happy as it's the most boring mechanic out there), it works quite well. Some of the weapons are a bit samey -- for instance, both ""red"" demon weapons lack an aerial combo, which is annoying -- but overall, they're pretty fun to use. They made pretty good use out of what was a fairly limited button-combination set. Some enemies are a bit too formulaic (Tyrants and Butchers are pretty much ""do X when they do Y, then you win) but most are designed such that you can take your pick as to how to destroy them.

The story is utterly forgettable, but who cares? The levels are really kinda fun, as the whole thing centers on the idea that the landscape can move and change (including allowing you to move and change it yourself). One level in particular has you walk through an area in the real world, then go to the demon realm where the small factory you were in is a sprawling hellscape suspended over a void. Trying to navigate it based on memory was interesting.

So, yeah. Admit to yourself that you never played DMC for the story, and just accept it as a bunch of new levels in which to kill things. The one thing I disliked was how closed-off some of the levels got, often having no ability to backtrack to find secrets -- particularly jarring as I'd just finished a DMC3 re-play, which is largely an open map you can wander around in more freely.

So, yeah. I started my Son of Sparda playthrough today, and it's got interesting enemy remixes. I'm enjoying it."

Also, summer break? Teachers are usually supplementing income and/or teaching during summer (it's what we do, after all!), going to workshops and professional development, assembling lesson plans for the entire upcoming year...tons of stuff like that. Also some are AP graders which sounds like a fuckton of time. Some teachers get to chill and travel, sure, but I think that's usually if they are financially comfortable enough to do so, such as having a spouse or having taught for a long time already.

I thought we had agreed at least on post-1938, for the wealth tax if for nothing else (and there were other things)?

Does jailing poets like Nazım Hikmet and Sabahattin Ali count (or was that just protection of the newborn state again, and thus ""had a reason"")? Does jailing and hanging protestors count because they were protesting changes that ""had a reason""? Because they all happened before 1938.

Even though I still think it's a bit weird, I kind of like it when he tips his hat for me.

Point is, old-school chivalry is very much a matter of context and audience. If it's how you were brought up and folks know that about you, that's one thing.

Why did nothing happen? She told you it would and you had the chance yet nothing did.

You mentioned in a response to someone else that he needs to trust the guy yet she says she trusted you very early on in the relationship... Being scared when it comes to having your first sexual experience is normal but she is letting you pleasure her while she neglects pleasuring you.

This is something you need to discuss with her. If she really does trust you then what is holding her back? Is not having an empty house to yourselves really the problem? Would family really open the door while you are having sex? Have they done so in the past with your current sexual activities?

My girlfriend and I have had sex on many occasions while my family are home. They respect our privacy and don't open the door while we are in my room.

fatalcharm,AskReddit,1390792220.0,"When I was 22-23 years old (I can't remember exactly as I was pretty much drunk all the time, everything around that time was a huge blur) I was hanging around a bad crowd. 

A few months before this incident happened, I was friends with a guy who I will call ""Ray"" who was interested in me and we were hanging out a lot and getting close. We ended up having an argument one day and stopped hanging out. So a few months go by and I become friends with another guy who I will call ""Jay"" and we were getting close. One day Jay and I were hanging out at my place drinking, when Ray suddenly turns up. 

I should have asked him to go away and really regret not asking him to leave but instead I invited him in and told Ray that Jay and I were leaving soon, so he couldn't stay for long. Jay and Ray talked for a little while I read a magazine. I wasn't actually listening to their conversation but apparently Ray said some things about Jay's friend who was murdered a little while back (Jay and Ray had mutual friends and knew of each other, although they had never met each other) and this offended Jay really badly, although he didn't show it at the time.

Eventually I said ""Ok, we are leaving so you have to go home now Ray"" so he left and Jay and I went to the local pub to drink some more. On the way back home from the pub, Ray drove past us on a scooter (we were walking) pulled up and said that he would like to go out with me sometime. I said no, but Jay was really angry that Ray had asked me out right in front of him (again Jay didn't show his anger) Ray drove off and we went home to drink some more.

We got back to my place and drank some more. Eventually Jay decided to go home so he called his friend to pick him up, Jay went home and I went to bed.

I woke up the next day to police knocking on my door, I let them in and they searched the place. I was told that Jay had gone around to Ray's house and assaulted him but wasn't given full details, I didn't think it was as serious as it really was. The police took me to the police station to make a statement but I couldn't really remember much of the night before and was actually still intoxicated when I made the statement.

I found out later that Jay had gone around to Ray's house, called him outside and then cut Ray's arm off with a samurai sword. Jay was apparently aiming for his head, but Ray put his arm up thinking that he was swinging a baseball bat (it was very dark when it happened) to protect his head and his arm was cut off. 

Doctors managed to reattach his arm, but he lost the use in his arm. Jay went to jail for a little while, then got out on home detention. Eventually he was given a suspended sentence and was free. I don't know what Jay is up to now, but he has a very supportive family and is probably doing well for himself. Ray's life has pretty much been ruined, he can't work ever again and last time I saw him, he was a very timid, scared person. I was also traumatized by the incident too, although I don't really feel that I have a right to be traumatized. I had quite a few issues to begin with from my childhood, but this sent me over the edge.

If I had just asked Ray to leave when he turned up at my house that day, and just told him that it wasn't a good time (which was my first instinct) then the whole thing would have never of happened.

I changed the names of the people involved and also left quite a few details out, if I gave you the full story, it would take forever to write."

jianadaren1,vexillology,1390792285.0,"&gt;As an Australian I am free to express my opinion on the Australian flag.

That's fine. You're saying what you like.

&gt; The only nations that should still fly this flag style are the British Overseas Territories

That's not fine. Now you're telling other countries that their flags are wrong.

&gt;I notice that the NATIONAL flag of Canada changed and they still maintain a strong and real connection to Britain: Queen Elizabeth II is still Canadian Head of State.

There's an ocean of difference between defending the existence of a connection, and asserting that the connection must be commemorated with a Union Jack on the flag. I never said and don't believe that Australia necessarily should have the Union Jack of on its flag, but your previous reasons for why it *shouldn't* were plain false - there *is* a connection and there's nothing inherently wrong with commemorating it. In short:

&gt;Australia is an independent nation and no longer a British dominion, as such it should not fly a British ensign flag.

That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't follow that you should no longer fly the British ensign flag because you're no longer a British Dominion. It doesn't make anymore sense than saying Quebec should no longer fly the Fleur de Lis because it's independent from France.

Your subsequent reasons (we're independent, etc.) are more coherent but they're not very strong unless you really want to make a anti-monarchial/ pro-republic declaration, which is fine, but you should probably come out and say it."

shiroganeookami,askscience,1390792307.0,"The reason we do most statistical transformations is actually related to the tests we do to determine significance. Every statistical test has an implicit set of assumptions: for example, the basic t-test assumes that your data is normally distributed. If it isn't, the test can't accurately determine the level of significance between them. In order to satisfy this, we often transform our data to make it look as normal as possible. 

You'll often hear about a type of data that is log-normally distributed (such as gene expression levels). What this means is that if you collect the data and log transform it, it will always appear to be normally distributed. This isn't cheating or changing the data, it's simply how the data should be looked at. Same goes for the reciprocal transformation. So long as you put in the methods section of your paper that the data is log-transformed, anyone should be able to go back and validate your results.

Now a word on cheating. As I said above, it's not cheating if you know your data needs to be reciprocally transformed and you do it from the start. However, if you look at your data using ten different transformations and figure out which one has a significant p-value, you are getting into a slight grey area. Technically, since you're looking at multiple p-values, the chances that you'll find a significant one by chance increase. As a result, it would probably be necessary to correct for multiple hypothesis testing if you did it too much. Of course, what most people do is try multiple transformations, find the one that makes your data look most normal, and then actually calculate significance.

Cygnus_X,wiiu,1390792343.0,"I have not purchased a wii U yet.  What is odd to me is (and this is just my personal outlook), you'd have to have perhaps a dozen titles like the wonderful 101 before I would be interested.  For some reason, paying $300 for a console with cutesy games such as mario and zelda seems unattractive when I could spend another $100 to 'upgrade' to a ps4 and have access to games such as 'the last of us'.  I've always been a big nintendo fan.  I have owned an nes, an snes an n64 and a wii.  But, these days, if you're not getting a giant theater experience from a game, it's hard to justify spending that much money on a console.  And for me, Nintendo doesn't deliver on the theater experience.  Just consider how much dialog you get out of mario and zelda games, let alone 3rd party titles.  Yet games such as Halo, Dark Souls and other titles that make the backbone of xbox and playstation are filled with audio interaction.  "

You can do vitamin k orally, but takes longer to administer. You can also deny the vitamin k all together. The reason vitamin k is given is to prevent potentially deadly bleeding issues.

As far as the eye  ointment the main argument against it is it makes the baby's eyesight blurry for a while and may interfere with bonding. But that's pretty stupid reason since babies have really bad eyesight at birth either way and bond by sense of touch and smell, not sight. The possible downside is eye infection which can cause blindness. Some women think since they don't have any STIs that they don't need it, but there are a variety of bacteria that can be an issue... Others say it's over use of antibiotics, possibly leading to resistance, however I would trust medical professionals and the public health authorities to weigh the risks and benefits on that one."

So if some bad luck brian signs a rookie contract for almost no money and than blows both his knees out and never plays again, he doesnt get totally fucked with almost no money and no education.

Diamondwolf,dogecoin,1390792531.0,"Sonder is a word used to describe the specific feeling of wonder achieved when thinking that everyone in the world and throughout time has their own life story.

And as a preceptor of this, you may just be a blur through the window of a house driven by, or the person waiting behind them in the coffee shop, never to be seen even while only a foot away.

I get a similar feeling when I drive past a certain hospital in my area. I was born there. Think about where you were born, and imagine a map that can cover every place you've ever been. Going back to your place of birth would complete the geographical tracing of everywhere you have ever been, everything you have ever done, every thought you have ever had. That's your life.

All of the crew knew this when they signed up for these routes, and now they're trying to make a quick buck off of Captain Phillips' story.  It's sad, but this is the world we live in.

Take a look at [this map](http://i.imgur.com/7NbFERb.jpg) from Wikipedia and tell me how you would get to Mombasa without encountering any reports of piracy.  Note that 600 miles would have been well within the red dotted line on the map.

Calling him a ""a sullen and self-righteous captain"" doesn't have anything to do with what happened.  I'm sure the hollywood version of the story has separated itself from fact in plenty of ways.  If it weren't for the attention these events received these crew members would not be filing a lawsuit.

Edit - Here's a quote from [his AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p2csm/i_am_captain_richard_phillips_whose_story/) a few months ago:

&gt;But if you look at a chart of our route, we were never outside of 600 miles. And this ship had been in that area for 4 years. So the warnings and advisories were basically if you can avoid the area, to avoid it by 600 miles and we were always in 600 miles. And ships had been taken out 1200 miles before, so the 600 miles was not that accurate.

The route of the ship originated and ended in dangerous waters.  It would have been impossible to get his cargo to it's destination, even with huge detours.  **The destination was in dangerous waters, and the crew knew this.**"

SURRENDER_YER_BOOTY,AskReddit,1390792717.0,"This lady was once handing out a few letters at my high school graduation, and I happened to get one. It was a letter for a job opportunity at [Vector Marketing](http://vectormarketing.com/) and I thought it'd be a pretty cool thing to try. It offered $18/hr for work that summer, and since I didn't have a job, I thought I'd sign up for an interview.

But after doing some research online, I found out that **the job is a complete scam.** Basically, they hire you as a door-to-door salesman who sells massively overpriced knives (like $1000 for a set). They train you for 18 hours (unpaid, 6 hours a day, 3 days of training) to show you how to use the knives and how to sell them. Then, you go door-to-door and offer to show your product in an hour-long sales presentation thing. You get your $18/hr if the person signs a form saying you've presented them the knives for an hour.

You may think this system is really easy to beat. Just tell your friends to sign forms and then collect your $18/hr. **However, if you don't sell any knives, then it reflects on your performance.** They'll call you a bad salesman, they'll require you to do more training--there goes your ""possible resume resource"". 

And not only that, but after doing some more research somewhere, I found out that the knives are only worth like $50. They expect--and even recommend during your training--to try to sell it to friends/family. Why? Because grandma will buy her cute grandkid's knife set, which she doesn't even need, for **$1000.** So you may think--there are some kids who of course lie, get paid for a few hours, collect their money and then they get fired. But for every kid that got his grandma to buy a set, the company just profitted like $900 instantly.

WinterCharm,changemyview,1390792776.0,"On this note, when we played Pro Tribes, we had to regulate the rules of a Comp match to make sure that things were fair for all teams. There were certain weapons, classes, and even combinations of items that were strictly outlawed to make the game fair. Both teams stuck to those rules, and it was better for everyone. 

I think that even in a competitive environment, it's okay to ban cheap/lame/unfair strategies if it's legitimately ruining the gameplay, and both sides (or a large majority of competitive teams, tournament refs, etc) agree that they aren't acceptable. 

The way we did it in Tribes was that these rules were voted on by the competitive community, on a per-season basis. They couldn't be changed mid season, or in any way give a team an unfair advantage. Everyone stuck to them, and I think it worked very well. 

So, I do think that in competitive gaming, there are some very cheap unfair and lame strategies, and that if they are truly that bad, the community will step up and mutually agree not to use them. 

Things that were banned in Tribes: 

1. Any overpowered weapon that was too far out of balance. 
2. The number of infiltrators you could have per team
3. Prism Mines - for being horrendously OP
4. Stealth spinfusor, for its ability to combo with another weapon for a instant invisible 1 hit kill
5. SAP 20 sniper rifle, for being way too powerful compared to other snipers. 
6. The entire infiltrator class was banned for 2 seasons. 
7. The plasma rifle was banned for 3 seasons. 

While we could have, as a community said, Anything goes... they ruined the flow of the game SO badly, that we an overwhelming majority voted to take them out of the game, and played by those modified rules.

And these were tournaments with a decent amount of money involved, along with sponsorships, etc. "

mmp31,politics,1390792837.0,"Minimum wage only temporarily raises the payrate of minimum wage workers. There's a reason that, say, engineers make X amount of times the amount of money that minimum wage workers make. It's because that's what the market has determined their labor is worth relative to each other, using our pricing structure to describe the labor values in absolute terms. The same goes for any job relative to another.

No amount of raising the minimum wage is EVER going to change the real relative labor values. What it does do, however, is distort the pricing structure that describes those labor values in absolute terms, until it (somewhat) recovers from government abuse. Eventually the wages of higher earners will go up and minimum wage earners will be making the same amount of money compared to the higher income groups as they were before.

The real problem is inflation. Since the minimum wage increase in 2009, prices have gone up 9%, which means that the poor have seen a decrease in their income of 9%. For people who can barely feed themselves, that is SIGNIFICANT. It also contributes to the wealth gap problem because inflation is essentially a hidden flat tax on all dollars, and flat taxes disproportionatley harm the poor.

Locking minimum wage to inflation is a non-solution, because it will not change the fact that the poor's wages will be devalued until minimum wage goes up again. We should demand that the government immediately abolish inflation, which is controlled entirely by the Federal Reserve. Then we won't have to worry about rising prices disproportionately harming the poor."

its also considered a very personal topic, like /u/yeah_im_bi said (btw great username). think; its a very intimate experience to share w/ another person, so yeah it is a big deal (at least to a lot of people).

it also encompasses feelings of inadequacy. for example, not being able to ""last long,"" feelings of one's sexuality, not sure if one is attractive or not, so maybe one feels bad about one's experiences or lack thereof.

however, some people are more casual about it, so they don't see it as a big deal."

I have to wonder, does this person even have a job?

Jumping directly into a high pressure sales position is clearly out of the question, but the first thing I can think of to recommend is to spend a good chunk of the day on actual work and among others. This will allow OP to build up confidence by applying what few skills and talents she may already have while gaining new ones along the way. The ideal position would be challenging enough to demand engagement but not so much that it's disheartening. Some amount of forced social interaction (i.e. more than initially seems comfortable) would probably be a good idea as well.

A lot of insecurity can be remedied by continuously proving to oneself that one is capable of rising to new challenges. Perhaps women don't hear this as often as men. I don't know.

There may be other factors at play (including an unusual appearance), but I get the sense that simple inactivity may be a big culprit here."

Yes, because that is my dating pool. That being said, I find some awkward guys annoying.

&gt; Do you look down on them as not ""fully-grown"" men?

I don't really equate social skills with maturity. There are plenty of incredibly smooth, sociable men who have the maturity level of a middle schooler who I would not call grown men.

&gt; Do you think about how his practice interacting with you will make him less awkward in the long run? Or are awkward guys inherently creepy?

Awkward guys are not inherently creepy. There are various types of awkward guys. The ones I tend to date are just kind of geeky and socially reserved. There are awkward guys who can't read social cues and that could make for creepiness.

The reasons they expose themselves could be entirely legitimate and necessary. Perhaps even unavoidable. Or it could be because more men are involved in street crime and thus at higher risk of being crime victims themselves. Or maybe because women are *too careful* which makes the male statistic look high in comparison. Or it could be because men are careless. Either way, I didn't say why men find themselves in these situations more often, I just said that it happens.

Then bang, the ringing shot of the Amby echoes in Spy's head and for a brief moment he is unnerved that he could do such a horrendous act. Yet he regains his nerve and the last image is him walking away from the body.

HallucinatesTigers,cringepics,1390793240.0,"Or or or it could be because most women are looking for guys that are taller or larger, while most men are looking for smaller or petite women. So fat guys are in a sense larger, whereas fat girls are not smaller. And of course there are outliers and personal opinion but in a general sense it's easier to see why fat guys would be more likely to have an SO than a fat girl. 

And stop blaming the fucking media. Adults should be able to make their own adult decisions, without people assuming it's because the TV told them how to think. Genetically speaking, the average man IS bigger than the average woman. So it's easy to assume why people are looking for certain traits that are biologically driven, not because of the media, especially when you consider that the media hasn't been around that long."

porpoiseoflife,mildlyinteresting,1390793355.0,"As a former bookstore clerk who once experienced a Sanderson drop-in, I'll chime in on this one.

I had a short line, two people tops, when this strange person comes in and starts pulling down every single copy of Way of Kings as well as Gathering Storm I have in the store. He brings them up to the counter and piles them up in front of the register with the USE THE OTHER LINE sign and goes back for more, even pulling down a copy of Mistborn and (I think) Hero of Ages.

Now, this wasn't my first day on the job or anything. I'd had hot-and-cold-running authors drop through that airport over the last few years. I knew exactly what was going on. Only one type of person does something like that: the author. So as soon as I could, I sprung out from behind the counter to shake him by the hand. 

Sanderson was in the middle of a signing tour for The Way Of Kings. He stopped in town to do his usual meet-and-greet at the Tattered Cover in Denver. After it was done, he hied off to the airport for his flight out. (Southwest Airlines, IIRC) But he still had more than enough time to sign a few books, plus be happily impressed with how quickly I caught on to who he was. I think I still have the ""Bela Was A Darkfiend"" bumper sticker he gave me that night, too."

Morrowind was about 26km^2 . Oblivion about 42km^2 .

And Chernarus is one of the smaller maps in ArmA. I frequently played on a 20x20 (400km^2 ) map called CLAfghan. It was very large, to say the least. It took a long time to drive anywhere because the terrain was so dangerous, so flight was the best option. But because of the mountains, trees, FOBs, and other terrain features, flight was also much more dangerous and exposed.

Anyway. ArmA has the ABILITY -- though no one really has the time to do it -- to have a 300x300km map, which is 90,000km^2 . Almost 1/2 the size of Daggerfall. Hope that helps."

Sorry it took so long for me to respond here - I was away from my sources, and then I decided that, in the interest of being as unbiased and properly methodological as possible, I would take out the copy of *Rubicon* that I got for Christmas and give it a go. Oh boy. I've just read the Preface so far and...oh boy. Okay. What follows will admittedly be a sort of rant on 'pop history' and the issues with it - outlined in a lovely little review of this book! 

---

So. Let's go page by page, shall we? [I'll actually go ahead and upload an album so that you can see my thought process while reading! :) This is proof that I actually DID read through it! Thoroughly!](http://imgur.com/a/YLeD3) ;)

Starting off on the first page - Holland begins his...tale... with a description of *Legio XIII* standing on the banks of the Rubicon, waiting on Caesar's word to advance. They're stamping their feet in the cold, waiting...waiting...waiting...Holland makes this process seem like one that took forever, saying...

&gt; They were not used to being kept waiting. Normally, when battle threatened, they would move and strike like lightning.

Sounds shiny, eh? Well, the issue is...that's also completely made up. First of all, **the legions were accustomed to waiting**. Battles didn't just...happen. They took LONG periods of time, sometimes days or weeks of manuevering, of soldiers standing in ranks, waiting for their orders - often times, they wouldn't fight at all. They were WELL used to waiting, as well as moving quickly when the situation demanded it. Now, on to the description of the scene at the Rubicon...let's go ahead and look at what an ACTUAL historian says. Adrian Goldsworthy describes the scene rather well. From *Caesar: Life of a Colossus*: 

&gt; [...] much earlier than normal he excused himself and left, asking them to stay and await his return. A few of his senior officers and attendants had been warned of this and met him outside. [...] Orders were also issued to the *Thirteenth* and the cavalry to follow him as soon as they were ready. He and several of his officers traveled in a hired carriage - Suetonius claims that it was drawn by a team of mules borrowed from a nearby baker's shop. Then they set off into the night down the road to Ariminum. [...] Therefore at some stage early on the 11th **he overtook the marching cohorts** and came to the River Rubicon. Before he crossed the bridge, he is said to have stopped, spending some time in silent thought before beginning to talk to his officers [...]

I went ahead and highlighted the relevent portion there. The *Thirteenth* would not have been ""waiting"" for all that long, considering that Caesar had advanced *past* them. Seriously, the entire first page is sacrificing accuracy for suspense. This is a recurring theme for Mr. Holland, however, I won't focus too much on this one - there's far worse to be had.

He continues this made-up scene with drama:

&gt; [...] to his staff officers, gathered around him, he appeared in a torment of irresolution.

That's the LAST thing that Caesar would have appeared to be at this point would be indecisive. His reputation was based on his rock-solid confidence in himself *and* his men. Indecisive would be one of the last words that I would use to describe the man. Back to Goldsworthy!

&gt; Before he crossed the bridge, he is said to have stopped, spending some time in silent thought before beginning to talk to his officers, Pollio amongst them. He is supposed to have spoken of the cost to himself if he did not take this step, and the price the whole Roman world would pay if he did so. 

That would be ancient history's version of claiming that he was a consummate politician to the end. The man made sure his officers knew that it was *he* who was being wronged here, and that he fully understood that he was taking a drastic measure - but that that measure was the only measure he could take. He wasn't *indecisive* about it - hell, he had sent a detatchment of the *Thirteenth* ahead to secure Ariminum, a town on the other side of the Rubicon, before he started out. **His men had already crossed into Italia, and therefore, he'd essentially already started the war.** His crossing was a formality that, being the man he was, he played to its full potential. His mind didn't, as Holland claims ""move in silence."" He made sure his decision was known by his men. 

Next line, I've already debunked, but it deserves a mention, cause I HIGHLIGHTED it. 

&gt; For Caesar, the moment of truth had finally arrived. Either he could submit to the law, surrender his command, and face the ruin of his career - or he could cross the Rubicon.

His men had already captured a town. It's not really a ""moment of truth"" when you've already acted. Derp.

---

Now. Holland goes ahead and uses this next bit quite a few times - utter hyperbole that's supposed to give you a crazed mental image. He makes the claim that ""Caesar was risking world war."" I understand a bit of hyperbole. I understand when it's said that Caesar tore the Roman Republic in half and caused a war throughout the Roman world. That's not bad. But when you *consistently* say ""world war,"" you, first of all, **prove that you don't actually understand what the term means,** and second, are trying to equate Caesar to...wait for it...Hitler. Yeah, Holland follows Godwin's law. Think I'm being extreme with this? Well, give me a sec. Holland goes ahead and actually CLARIFIES that analogy in a bit. Isn't it great? Let's continue. Actually, continuing the *paragraph*, he says that ""Caesar did indeed engulf the world in war"" - which invites me to go ahead and say that Mr. Holland would do well to read the dictionary to find the definition of ""world."" 

Actually, lemme quote that one. There's a lot of bad in it.

&gt; By crossing [the Rubicon], Caesar did indeed engulf the world in war, but he also helped to bring about the ruin of Rome's ancient freedoms, and the establishment, upon their wreckage, of a monarchy - events of primal significance for the history of the West. Long after the Roman Empire itself had collapsed, the opposites delineated by the Rubicon - liberty and despotism, anarchy and order, republic and autocracy - would continue to haunt the imaginings of Rome's successors. Narrow and obscure the stream may have been, [...]

And he goes on. Anyways, let's chop this bit to pieces. 

**""Caesar did indeed engulf the world in war.""**

Dictionary, Mr. Holland. Your rhetoric is already getting silly, and this is the *third page*. 

**""...also helped to bring about the ruin of Rome's ancient freedoms, and the establishment, upon their wreckage, of a monarchy...""**

Ah, the 'murica rhetoric. This might seem strange to nitpick at (Wasn't the Principate a monarchy? Why, yes it was!), but what EXACTLY is he talking about when he says ancient freedoms? Oh, the next paragraph says that. Freedom of speech, private property, rights before the law. Okay, so all he's doing is *making you feel with the word ""freedom.""* If that makes sense. I'm going to move on, because honestly, Caesar didn't ""take away the rights and freedoms of Roman citizens."" Actually, if you want me to be REALLY honest...he sort of helped people out quite a bit - off the top of my head, most of his army wasn't composed of citizens - and yet he still treated them as if they were, even if that was of...questionable legality. 

**...the opposites delineated by the Rubicon - liberty and despotism, anarchy and order, republic and autocracy...""**

Okay, Mr. Holland. We get it. You love America and the world is black and white. The issue is that none of this has **anything** to do with Ancient Rome, the Rubicon River, or even the politics at hand. Caesar went to war to preserve his own *dignitas*. It wasn't because he was an autocrat. It wasn't because he wanted to oppress the Roman people. He went to war because he didn't back down - and because his enemies were as determined to bring him down as he was to stop them. Caesar had an ego, and he would fight to preserve it. Sooooo.... *shrug*

Next paragraph!

Celebreth,AskHistorians,1390793616.0,"This one's even more of an appeal to your love of freedom. If you have small children, please! Avert their eyes!

&gt; With it, an era of history passed away. Once, there had been free cities dotted throughout the Mediterranean. In the Greek world, and in Italy too, these cities had been inhabited by men who identified themselves not as the subjects of a pharaoh or a king of kings, but as citizens, and who proudly boasted of the values that distinguished them from slaves - free speech, private property, rights before the law. Gradually, however, with the rise of new empires, first those of Alexander the Great and his successors, and then of Rome, the independence of such citizens everywhere had been stifled. By the first century BC, there was only one free city left, and that was Rome herself. And then Caesar crossed the Rubicon, the Republic imploded, and none was left at all.

So much is wrong with this, I'm not even sure where to start. First off, he implies the ""Golden age of democracy and freedom and everyone was equal and YAY!"" Well...that's just not the case. Many of these city-states were ruled by others (They were mostly settled by the Phoenicians, generally Tyre, and the Phoenicians were a puppet of Assyria. Nuff said? Many others were settled by the Athenians and other Greeks - so democracy, riiight? Let's look at one of the bigger cities, a place called Syracuse! Syracuse was ruled by a tyrant (since 485 BCE). Also known as a king, despot, monarch, whatever word you want to use. He talks about how they proudly distinguished themselves from slaves, *alluding* slavery to the other forms of government, which is not true at all. And then, to cap it all off, when it comes to our story, he makes the (rather audacious) claim that Rome had ""stifled the independence of citizens everywhere,"" and that ""Rome was the only free city left."" Hold on a tic. Apparently Holland hasn't heard of the Social War, other cities that shared the same rights as Rome, or how about the fact that Rome didn't yet control the entire Mediterranean. Oh wait, and the *rest of the world*. But nope. Rome had stifled all independence. Obviously. If you'd like me to go into more detail on how flawed this mentality is, I'll be happy to. But moving on...

He then makes the claim that ""then Caesar crossed the Rubicon, the Republic imploded, and none was left at all."" On the contrary, under Augustus and the Principate, Roman citizens weren't oppressed. They weren't slaves. **AND THEY STILL CALLED ROME A REPUBLIC.** They still had their freedoms that Caesar apparently trampled, they still had their rights, and the idea that there was no more freedom left is bloody mental.

---

&gt; As a result, a thousand years of civic self-government were brought to an end, and not for another thousand, and more, would it become a living reality again.

More hyperbole from our favourite pseudo-historian. So, let's see what he's claiming. He claims that:

1. Civic government had been a thing for a thousand years.

2. Caesar crossing the Rubicon brought all that to an end.

3. Civic government didn't exist for over a thousand years afterwards.

Apparently, the Phoenician city-states never existed. Neither did Sumeria (just as a couple of examples). Both of which had civil governments that began far over just a thousand years BCE. Sumeria dates back to ca. 4,000 BCE. Yeah, I'd say that's a bit more than just a thousand years of civic self-government, but hey - that's just me.

Next - Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon didn't bring that to an end. Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon precipitated a *civil war*, not the mass collapse of every independent civic government ever. Rome's conquest of many of the city-states in the Mediterranean brought those independent city-states to heel, certainly. However, that wasn't the end of civic government - apparently he doesn't exactly understand the history of the Middle Ages - and leaves the definition of ""civic self-government"" to be rather vague. What do you define as ""civic self-government?"" A city governing itself? Okay. How about the land that city controls? Does that fall under the civic self-government umbrella, or does that automatically discount it? 

MOVING ON.

&gt; Since the Renaissance there have been many attempts to ford back across the Rubicon, to return to its far bank, to leave autocracy behind. The English, American, and French revolutions were all consciously inspired by the example of the Roman Republic.

Aaaand here comes the political rhetoric. See how easily he transposes an event into something **completely** different? Crossing the Rubicon automatically turns into the inspiration for the Renaissance, America, France, and England, all turned into one, all focused towards FREEDOM. He even supports it with a quote! An INSPIRING quote! 

&gt; As to rebellion in particular against monarchy, one of the most frequent causes of it is the reading of the books of policy, and histories of the ancient Greeks, and Romans. 

Know what he's referring to there? He's referring to when Rome overthrew their monarchs in **the late 6th century BCE.** the Rubicon happened in the **First* century BCE. 

I'm gonna stop there for now - I've already poured myself far too much wine to push through this :P If you'd like me to keep going tomorrow, I'd be happy to, but for now, I must head off to bed. I *do* hope that helped to answer your question as to what was wrong with *Rubicon* - namely that Holland made shit up where it was applicable and stuck it in, adding fancy descriptions and appeals to freedom. And political commentary, for that matter. If you'd like an actual *history* that covers the events that Holland claims to, I'd highly advise *Caesar: Life of a Colossus*. It's about the same price, and it gives you a FAR better understanding of the time :)

**TL;DR - The issue with *Rubicon* is that Holland not only cherry-picks his history to an extent that it's not clear that he understands what he's talking about, but he uses history as a basis for his own politics - here's a quote from the LAST page that, if you read between the lines, essentially says that this work is bollocks:**

&gt; ""In short, the reader should take it as a rule of thumb that many statements of fact [""fact""] in this book could plausibly be contradicted by an opposite interpretation [...] Following a lengthy spell in the doghouse, narrative history is now squarely back in fashion [Not really] - and even if, as many have argued, it can function only by imposing upon the random events of the past an artificial pattern, then that in itself need be no drawback.""

**Essentially, this sums up everything wrong with Mr. Holland. He freely admits to warping what happened to his own benefit, and argues that ""history"" should be ""whoever can make up the best stories.""**

I rest my case. "

Having large amounts of available torque from a dead stop can compound these problems. Trucks, having a set weight limit, haven't had a need for this technology like the rail freight industry. A truck has a maximum; a train, alternatively, can pull incredibly varied loads. The need for such a versatile power train predicated itself in locomotives. Also, trucks have highway safety, DEQ emissions requirements, and general automotive conformity to contend with. The road systems in the United States were built for all purpose use, to include trucking. Rail systems are purpose built for incredible loads, and less frequent use. "

More or less same thing happened to me. Only it wasn't my now ex's co-worker, it was her drug dealer. Its one hell of a story. But I don't want to try and 'steal your thunder' on this thread.

Its nice not to feel alone in this kind of betrayal, and you shouldn't either. Why people do this instead of being honest is beyond me. It sickens me to know I wasted so much time of my life with her.

Looking back though, I try not to see it as waste, but as growth to becoming a much stronger person. To trust my gut. To not simply believe that because were in love, this person is not capable of hurting me.

Its hard to trust again, but that ability is coming back.

I hope it does for you too.

Side note: The gaslighting thing is terrible too, she re-wrote the past for her parents and tried to shove the garbage down my friends throats too. Questioning your sanity and believing that your not the crazy one is a tough thing.

Example: She got high as fuck one night (her choice was percoset), and let slip that she might be pregnant and that it wasn't mine. Next morning denies it and tells me I'm making it up ect.

Shiseido is found in department stores, Kat Von D is in Sephora, and I think CoverFX might be both? They go pretty fair and have a range of undertones. Maybelline Baby Skin seems to be a good primer. Don't use Monistat Anti-chafing gel: the pH is wrong, and it could encourage acne. 
 
Mascara definitely makes a great difference for you. You've got beautiful eyes that you should do your best to emphasize. 

You actually have a very symmetrical face (no one has a perfectly symmetrical one), but you can always contour to make it even more so. Look up tutorials for help. Lise Eldridge and Goss makeup artist are my favorite. 

You might want to start with a powder for your brows? Either a brow powder or a matte eyeshadow, to just emphasize them a bit. I think you want an ashy taupey sort of color. If you go for a different look all at once, you'll think you look weird, so change something slightly, see if that's good, and see if taking it one step stronger would be good. "

Eventually L got in contact with Light and very strongly suspected him (which is why I used the word basically), which is when Light turned himself in so that he could fool L into thinking that he's innocent.

Omega037,changemyview,1390794044.0,"First, everyone gets health care when needed, insurance is just about who gets billed afterwards.

Also, we generally have different level plans depending on how much of a premium you want to pay.  I pay somewhere around $200 a month for my wife, son, and myself to have a $500 deductible (for 85% of cost) at the hospital and $20 copays for office visits.  Another $50 or so gets me full (100%) dental and vision coverage as well.  If I were willing to pay another $100 or so a month, I could have $250 deductible (for 100% of cost) and $15 copays.

So while it isn't perfect, it isn't breaking the bank.  My son was born a few months ago and between the OBGYN visits, the delivery, the post-delivery work, various pathology/tests, circumcision, and then 3 days for both my wife and son in the hospital, it only cost around $1700.    

Had I been wise enough to get the higher plan and fill my HSA, it probably would have cost me half that.  That said, it did hit the annual deductible limit, so everything after that was free.  Also, this was in one of the top hospitals in the state and with private rooms.  It would have been cheaper elsewhere.

Also, having talked to a friend of mine who recently had a child, if my income wasn't so high, I could have worked with the hospital to get the amount cut by maybe 40%."

Inter-planetary warfare is actually pretty simple though.  You don't need lasers or phasers or ion cannons or special bombs or anything...

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1390794363.0,"I remember that thread. In that poster's case, your points about the skillful way of using tattoos didn't really apply. He got a large tattoo of a Boddhisattva on his chest and stomach. After the sensitivity left over from getting the tattoo faded away, how would having that tattoo there give him reminders throughout the day unless he walked around shirtless with a mirror always at hand? 

Even more generally, there are very few jobs that allow tattoos to be visible, so how often are you able to sneak a peek at your wrist tattoo (for example) without breaking company policy? Whereas places of employment usually don't prohibit Buddhist pendants or malas, unless you work in a privately owned religious organization or you work in a country which doesn't separate religion from the State.

I'm not trying to insult a particular person, just relating what actually happened to your justification in order to think about it practically."

*Orville and Albert continue to build the wall. Together, they harvest and shape stone, and assemble it to protect the well. Orville periodically tests the wall's strength with his cane, at one point knocking over a small portion of it. He tunnels away for a bit leaving Albert to repair it, and returns with mud from the river, which the duo use as a much more effective adhesive substance. This continues for quite some time. Multiple uses are made of Orville's saw, cane, and even screwdriver when dealing with minor bits of structural excess, using it as an improvised pick. More than once, Orville thinks to himself that this would be easier if he still had the pick-hammer, but he has tossed it into the sea.*  
  
*Eventually, there is a wall build around the entirety of the well, 8-feet tall, but Orville is not satisfied. He pulls large boulders out of the ground to climb on, and works with Albert to build a rounded ceiling, putting the well in a protective dome. He destroys the boulders he used to boost his height, and steps back. He gives the structure a mighty whack with his cane, and it does not budge.*

If he needs to be with other women to feel fulfilled then that's his prerogative but that doesn't mean he has the right to lie to you and cheat on you. Opening up a relationship requires all parties to be 100% sure this is what they want. 

If him being with other women bothers you then it bothers you and you have a right to want a monogamous relationship.

You both need to talk this out, maybe even with a therapist present so that you two can discuss and negotiate the dynamics of your relationship so that you're both happy.

InfinitelyThirsting,AskWomen,1390794607.0,"Something else to remember: It isn't old-fashioned to wear a fedora. Unless you only wear it outside. It has *never* been proper or fashionable to wear a hat inside, even in the heyday of the fedora. Or ANY other hat. Men have never worn hats inside, until lame nostalgic dudes who have no idea what hat eras were like tried to bring them back. Hats are outerwear! Never wear it inside.

It's not charming or cute or sweet, either, unless it's a very occasional silly thing. It's affected, stilted, and pretentious.

And if you wear a fedora or trilby inside, you're even worse than just being affectedly archaic. Then, you become just ridiculous, like wearing a corset over a tee shirt. But considering that you're mixing fedoras in with m'ladys, you'd be the kind of anachronistic person who'd just irritate the shit out of me.

cfmonkey45,AskHistorians,1390794638.0,"Lorica segmentata was designed largely as a form of scale/plate hybrid armor that had overlapping strips of metal that allowed a wide range of protection. Its initial advantages, namely being more sturdy and resilient as a form of armor, were outweighed by its cost, and the technical proficiency necessary to create it.

By no means was the Lorica segmentata standard-issue for all Roman legions. Only a handful at a time possessed them, and largely based on seniority. By contrast, lorica hamata, or chainmail, was tried and true, and had been used since antiquity. Everyone knew how to create and use it, and it was relatively cheap and effective.

The period in which it was created and implemented was also the high-watermark period of the Roman Empire, when the Empire possessed a technological proficiency, with economies of scale, and labor markets that would not be rivaled until the industrial revolution. What ended it largely was the period of instability known as the Crisis of the Third Century, in which the Roman Empire was torn apart by civil war and strife that lasted several decades and nearly ended it.

The resulting reconstituted Empire stabilized in the Fourth Century under the reign of Constantine and his sons. Constantine reformed the military away from a legionary model towards a rapid response model, firstly to eliminate the political threat the army posed, but also to posture the Empire towards defending its borderlands. However, by the end of the Fourth Century and the beginning of the fifth century, Rome was confronted with a new stream of problems: barbarian incursions.

While barbarians had been encountered quite frequently, and many even made deep incursions in the Empire, only to be drawn back, this was the first time in which Barbarians had scored several crushing victories over the Romans, notably at Adrianople, where the Eastern Roman Emperor was slain by roving Goths."

TheBestNarcissist,AskMen,1390794668.0,"YES! I'm fact, there's almost no reason to frequently wash your hands from a  health standpoint if you're a healthy individual. Do you know that you have 10 times the number of bacterial cells on and in your body compared to human cells? (on mobile, citation needed). The war on bacteria is actually becoming a huge issue for our society. The overuse of antibiotics is leading to what many researchers say is the death of the golden age of antibiotics. 80% of antibiotic usage has been in agriculture because they allow livestock to grow larger (citation). 50% of prescribed antibiotics in the last 10 years (I think it's 10) were deemed unnecessary for treatment according to a recent NIH paper (citation). Why is that bad? Exposing bacteria to antibiotics supplies a huge selective pressure that increases the likelihood of the resistant bacteria becoming more populated. So if all those antibiotics weren't used, there would be no selection and bacteria populations wouldn't become resistant as quickly. 

So what does this have to do with hand washing? A large part of it I'd public knowledge. Bacteria aren't bad by nature. In fact, the majority cause nothing bad to happen. Some do good things for you, and we're just starting to really realize their importance (the emergence of probiotics in the past few years). Along with that is the idea that living a sterile life doesn't necessarily make you healthier. You can make a pretty good argument that exposing yourself to everything you can in our extremely safe, healthy society will increase your natural defense mechanisms. MRSA, the reemergence of other (superversions) of bacterial are still rare - getting a cold, the flu (viral!), or a random bug that makes you feel a little yucky by not washing your hands may be a very good defense for 50 years from now when super strains of E coli, strep, and other common bacterial illness are prevalent. For example, the current flu bug going around isn't affecting the elderly as much as younger people - because their bodies identify and can defend against the strain.

I'll try to remember to provide the citations tomorrow."

Not that that's necessarily what Jordan was trying to imply, but when he had to work to come up with unique styles and trends of a dozen different countries, doesn't surprise me that maybe one of the more reserved countries would reflect Elizabethan England.

Still...I guess I'm a bit confused.  His core issue seems to be that he got into an argument with a couple of trolls on twitter.  He seems disatisfied with the *status quo* so I have to ask, what does he want done about it?

The community *as a whole* is very supportive of him, and modders in general.  Positive comments and threads get voted up here on reddit; negative comments and threads get voted down.  I don't really use twitter, but poking around I saw many more positive comments than negative comments.

It's the internet:  A hard fact of life is that a small handful of trolls will always exist.  **What does he expect us to do about it?**  Anything?  Is this is a ""I'm leaving because the community has failed to do something"" post?  (And if so, then what have we failed to do?  What does he want?)  Or is this a ""I'm leaving because I have a lot of drama in my life right now and I can't handle the trolls"" post?  (Which would be perfectly fine if so!)

I guess I'm just confused over the lesson we're meant to draw from this.  He's phrasing it as ""community fails modders"", but I literally cannot discern anything that the community, in whole or in part, is meant to do.  If things are broken, this is a good opportunity to fix them.  So...what's broken?  How do we fix it?  (Unless the issue is ""trolls exist"", because, well, I don't think we can change that.  All we can do is shout them down/downvote them when and as they crop up, and we're *doing* that...)"

However, the outright banning of guns will accomplish very little besides depriving people of the ability to protect themselves from those who acquire guns illegally or attack in large groups.  Thinking that removing guns from the equation will stop people from killing themselves or others is an overly-simplistic solution to a complex problem involving genetic predisposition, cultural issues, and socio-economic disparity.  Not having guns didn't stop people from murdering eachother prior to their invention, and it doesn't stop them from murdering eachother in countries where guns are illegal.

You're legally required to report income derived from employment.

&gt;if I could get into any trouble for not reporting that job on my taxes this year

Realistically, very low chance.  At your income level the tax code is basically on the honor system.

&gt;I want to make sure I file my taxes correctly!

In that case, you must report the income.  If you report it as self-employment income on Sched C you'll end up having to send some of it in to the IRS, although, depending on your total gross income, probably not very much.

If you believe you were employed as a normal employee, with regular hours, and were paid regular wages, and you should have filed a W-4 and I-9, and never were asked to do those things, and your employer should give you a W-2 by the deadline (mid-Feb) but does not do so, then you could file form 4852, a report of a missing form W-2.  Although this might be the technically correct thing to do, it almost certainly will also get your employer in trouble.

You can definitely and easily achieve a look like After Effects or Photoshop with Qt and some use of stylesheets to override the default system UI look.  
  
I'm not even sure what in After Effects or Photoshop would be hard to recreate with Qt?  I mean, even way nicer and complex UIs like Nuke, Katana and Maya are written in Qt.  
  
FWIW, I have very rarely seen a custom UI system done well across platforms without tons of R&amp;D money thrown at it. Even Maya, which has a lot of R&amp;D money, was rewritten in Qt because it was getting impossible to keep their OS specific hacks in place any longer.  
  
With something like Qt, you get the advantage of easy customizability, very easy overriding, complete cross platform support and a community that is not only very helpful, but also experienced and continuously working to improve a common toolkit.  
  
Also, the advantage of Qt is you allow other people to repurpose their tools to your app very easily. For example, if I build an asset manager for Maya, I can very easily repurpose most of it for Nuke very easily because they both use Qt.  "

candydaze,anonymous123421,1390795888.0,"Thank-you. Unfortunately, some people (both feminists and MRAs, but not all of either group) believe that it's a 0 sum game. That by increasing the standards for one gender, we necessarily decrease the standards for the other. 

But I firmly believe this is not the case - often, issues that affect men also affect women. For example, rape culture. It harms men and women. It's a culture where women are blamed for their rape, but it's also a culture that teaches men it's shameful for them to be raped, or that they can't be raped. That culture also teaches us that men are wild animals, incapable of controlling their desires. It doesn't benefit either gender, so removing this culture benefits both genders. 

Another example is that of women being successful in the majority of child custody cases. That is because women are seen as the only primary carers. And because of that, women are occasionally less successful in job markets, because of the perception they'll go off and get pregnant within six months. Men are looked down upon for being stay-at-home parents for the same reason women find it hard to enter male dominated workforces. 

It's not a 0 sum game. "

I like Elf mostly for blush, and their mineral lipsticks are really nice. Also, their lip lock pencil, and their studio line brushes. 

Brown mascara is good for a natural look, certainly, although if you want a formal or dramatic look, I'd still go for black. What mascaras tend to work for you? I like Boots No7 Exceptional Definition, and Maybelline Full and Soft Washable, but there's any number of good mascaras from the drugstore.

sturdyliver,Christianity,1390796342.0,"I doubt they'd hold out on confirming you for another year just because you missed the first few weeks of RCIA. It's worth asking whoever is in charge of the program if they can get you in the class. In my experience they will typically let you in.

Typically RCIA consists of classes, a presentation/profession to the congregation at a Sunday Mass once during the year, and finally confirmation (preceded by baptism if you are not already baptized) at the Easter vigil. You will need to pick a sponsor who is already a confirmed Catholic, or if you don't know the right person, you can ask the parish to help you find someone. I'm currently sponsoring a friend of mine, and I try to go to his classes whenever possible.

codayus,feedthebeast,1390796442.0,"Whups, I'm slow to the party but:

The context of all this is a Greg/mDiyo dustup where one modder doesn't want his visions compromised, and as a result decided he doesn't want his mod installed alongside another mod.

Marc is saying that:

1. You cannot use malicious code to enforce these restrictions.  (Because it is against the Minecraft EULA.)
2. You cannot use copyright to enforce these restrictions.  (Because copyright simply does does not apply; Stephen King has copyright on his books, but he cannot tell me I can't put one on a shelf next to a copy of Twilight.) 
3. Therefore, if you don't like the idea that your mod may be used in ways you don't like, you should just not release it.

And he explicitly mentioned Minecraft as an example of this; when Mojang released it they did so knowing that they couldn't stop people, eg, making squid porn machinama videos with it.  Obviously Marc was not saying **that when Mojang released Minecraft they lost all copyright on it**; that's 1) stupid and 2) wrong.  :)  He's saying that when Mojang released Minecraft they lost a lot of control over what people could do with it...but they still own it!

So...yes.  Marc says you can't use malicious code to try and enforce control over your mod.  But that's pretty much all he's saying.  And in particular everything he is saying is in the context of **USE**; over whether you can put the Stephen King book on whatever shelf you like.  His comments are not about **distribution** which is where copyright actually applies.

(To be clear, he got a bit tangled up himself over the distinction while trying to clarify things, so some confusion was certainly understandable.  But this has all been clarified repeatedly at this point.)

TL;DR:  You're linking to comments made about how/if modders can control how people use their mods (which they cannot).  You're trying to apply that the question of how/if modders can control **distribution** of their mods (which they can).  This doesn't make any sense."

JihadTape,malefashionadvice,1390796681.0,"I really appreciate the thoughtful response!

I think you sold me on the Vans Authentics (which were near the top of the list to begin with). I'm going to get the grey, as the white on white is too much for my sense of style. I was also going to go with the Sperry Topsiders, but those are meant to replace my sandals and go sockless around the neighborhood.

Thanks for all the tips!"
sockalicious,personalfinance,1390796681.0,"If you can deduct home mortgage interest, your effective interest rate after taxes is lower, depending on your income  - you should consider that; because you don't get a tax break on investment returns. 

Also, I would rather pay off the mortgage with future dollars and invest today dollars today, because there will be inflation between then and now.

If you make a principal payment today, 2014, on a new 30 year mortgage, bear in mind you're paying off principal that was scheduled to be paid off in 2044, with 2044 dollars.  In other words, early principal payoff now takes away interest now and in future, but also takes away principal payments made at the end of the loan.  Over 30 years, 2% inflation reduces the actual purchasing power of that last principal dollar by 45%; so you'd be better off paying that last dollar off with a 2044 dollar than a 2014 dollar.

The calculation taking into account present-discounted-value of money on both principal and future interest payments; rate-of-return on investments; and tax-adjusted mortgage interest rates is not arithmetically simple - it bogs Excel down - and it requires guesses about future inflation, future rates of investment return, and future legislative changes regarding the mortgage interest income tax deduction. 

I plugged in some plausible guesses about this when I got my first mortage at 5.25% and decided that I would have to be offered a foolproof-risk free return over 30 years in excess of 12% to make early payoff of a dollar of mortgage principal anything like ""not insane.""  If I had a foolproof risk free 12% return on anything available to me, all my assets would already have been in that, so I quit thinking about it.

Since then I've refi'd down to 3.25%.  There is no way on earth that paying off my principal early could ever make any sense; I no longer think about it.

md619,AskMen,1390796710.0,"&gt;I think I need the male form of respect as I think that I and other girls like me are dismissed generally as '[deadweight] teenage girls' even though there might be ways that we can engage and be useful to you, but at the moment are instead seen as barriers or annoyances whom they have nothing in common with.

You're a teenager. Guy or girl, you are most likely deadweight. You haven't been on this earth long enough to learn or have done anything of value. If you don't want to be considered useless then learn skills that won't make you useless as you grow up. It's really that simple. You won't get respect in till you've paid your dues.

I still think you're worried about nothing. No one expects teenagers to be anything other than deadweight. That's just the process of growing up. You can still be a likeable person without necessarily commanding respect."

I can't think of a single girl in ANY of the sororities at my university that were like this. It's a trope that makes people think that they know what sororities are like, just because of big films. 

I'm not arguing that there are no sorority girls in the entire world that are like this, but once you delve further into the Greek system, you find out that the girls are much more HUMAN than you would ever expect. Women are normal women. You have to volunteer in a sorority, you are expected to get along with the other girls. They're not bimbos. They're kids who have recently graduated high school (within the past 4 years at least, usually), and they're trying to find their way through young adulthood.

FlightsFancy,todayilearned,1390796855.0,"I think, rather than ""be skeptical,"" better to say, ""think critically."" Skepticism requires suspicion of the motives and motivations of others, and little else. It can be pretty unproductive, especially when you need to examine a complex issue or event (particularly something that happened in the recent past, like the Phillips story).

Saying ""I don't believe it"" or ""That's probably not the real story"" moves you in the right direction, but critical thinking will allow you to start asking the right questions: whose version of the story are we getting? Why is this version being told, and not others? What events are examined? Why those, and not others? 

Questions are better than blanket statements. We're talking about the formation and application of human narrative, not objective truth. Claiming to know ""the answer"" because it's a skeptical one doesn't clarify the situation: it just adds another voice to the chorus, rather than offering something new and insightful."

I think I need to watch the videos all more closely, because I've heard this mentioned before and I don't really get it. Nothing seemed particularly rude to me, and most of the negative reactions I've seen have less to do with her attitude and more to do with not wanting to hear any of it."

Prancemaster,SquaredCircle,1390797142.0,"&gt;It's simple: crowds want to see the person they paid to see go over.

You paid to go watch whatever the WWE gives you. Bryan had an early match-of-the-year candidate match with Bray Wyatt to kick off the PPV. They trust him enough to get the show kicked off, which is a huge task for a PPV. That placated me enough that even if Bryan didn't make a surprise entrance into the rumble, overcoming getting the shit beaten out of him by Bray Wyatt, I still got a solid 20 minute block of him without 29 other guys sloppily fighting around him. 

&gt;hy do you think the WWE offered refunds to people when it turned up that he wasn't going to be able to make a house show? The kid is putting butts in seats. If you think David Batista put anywhere close to the number of butts in seats than Daniel Bryan did, you're out of it. I'm rambling, but my point is that when the crowd VERY OBVIOUSLY wants something to happen and then it doesn't happen, the crowd is going to be PISSED.

PPVs and house shows really can't be compared, IMO. Undoubtedly, Daniel Bryan sells tickets, but so do Cena, CM Punk, Orton, the Usos, the Real Americans, Kofi Kingston and many other superstars who are featured on TV shows and PPVs. I don't really think Batista will sell as much as they think he will, especially after tonight, but I am eager to see how this all plays out, which is  something WWE excels at doing for me.

bigt252002,AirForce,1390797212.0,"Solid advice in here. Here is a list of things for you to do before even thinking about classes 

- Finish Tech School and get great scores throughout your block tests. Seriously, this WILL follow you to your first base. Set the tone right away that you are dependable and that you can handle learning and military life. 

- Finish your CDCs and get a good EOC score at the end of it. Once again, it will demonstrate to your Supervisor that you can handle the rigors of military life and still handle studying on your own. 

- Once you have complete your CDC's, only now should you be asking if you can take classes. You are removed from any formal self-study for your AFSC as far as AETC is concerned. Because of those first two points you will prove to your Supervisor through real events that you can handle school and handle doing your job without either being negatively affected by the other. They should then let you do it."

namesaremptynoise,Advice,1390797347.0,"Hi there, redditor a little more than a month since my last cigarette here:

You have *no* idea how hard it is to quit smoking.  **No idea.**  I had a steady meth habit for nearly a year and I quit that in a week.  I started smoking 17 years ago and it took me more tries than I can count over a period of the last three years since my mother was diagnosed with cancer and my aunt died of it to get to where I am now, and even then it's a *constant* struggle *every day* not to go down to the store and pick up another pack, even though the nicotine is fully out of my system.  

I'm not saying just let your dad kill himself, I'm saying try to be a little understanding of him and not make him struggling with what's agreed by physicians and psychologists as one of the absolute hardest addictions to beat about *you*.  Getting mad at him is only going to stress him out, and you know what a smoker wants more than anything when they're stressed out?  That's right, to smoke.  

Be supportive, keep him honest with himself, but getting confrontational and making a scene about it isn't going to do anything but make *you* feel a little better for a minute, and then make you *more* angry at him because he's having trouble beating this addiction that he's likely had longer than you've been alive and it's hurting your feelings.

You can't beat an addiction for other people.  Not for your s/o, not for your parents, not for your kids, you can only do it for yourself.  Stop making it about you and support him in trying to do this for himself so that he'll be healthier and happier and live longer."

throwyerselfaway,AskReddit,1390797643.0,"About six months ago.  I abandoned my cats.

I've been moving around a lot in the past five years.  Within cities and across states, for both jobs and schools.  I got my cats at the humane society about 3 years before abandoning them.  About six months ago, I was jobless and leaseless and had the choice of going home to live with my mom (who is emotionally abusive, where I have no bed to sleep on, and in a town where I'd have no career prospects and no longer know anyone except family), or trying to make it in a city I loved, near people I loved, where I had career/school connections, where I had friends who could help put me up until I found a job (which I did, a week later).  The cats couldn't join me, though.  I couldn't afford them, and they couldn't stay where I'd be living.

I tried a couple different things.  I tried craigslist before roadtripping to the new city, I tried seeing if a friend I stopped with along the way could take them in, I tried surrendering them to an animal shelter (had to be a resident of that county to do so, and pay $75).  I even looked into shipping them home to my mom or grandma, but it was not affordable.  I was at my wit's end about an hour from my final destination.  I pulled behind a Save-a-lot, checked that the coast was clear, and dumped both of them into a bush.  

My heart is breaking just writing this.  One of the cats had been found in an abandoned house before I adopted him; the other was just 4 weeks old.  They were the most affectionate cats, curling up with me each night and running to greet me every time I opened the door.  One summer, I had them stay with my mom for a few months and when I would call, she'd put me on speaker phone and the talkative cat would start meowing and run to the phone, rubbing up against it.  She didn't do this with other people.  I loved them.  They were family.  And I abandoned them.

I don't think of them every single day.  I feel I should, but I don't.  But the days I do, there's an empty place inside.  My heart physically tightens and sometimes I feel like I'm about to cry, and I've cried maybe 5 times in my adult life.  This is the biggest regret, and the worst sin.

Both cats are microchipped, and about two weeks after the dumping, a humane society called me telling me one of them had been brought in.  This was the sweetest, most docile cat, and he was fighting and biting at the volunteers.  They said I could come pick him up if I wanted; I told them I couldn't have cats at my new apartment and could they put him up for adoption; they said maybe, but they might have to euthanize if his behavior didn't improve.  He did get adopted about 3 weeks later, but I let the possibility hang there that he would be killed.  I kick myself for that, too.

The other cat has never turned up.  She could've been hit by a car or just wandering afraid in the wilderness.  She's the one who would meow at my voice on the phone and crawl on my lap as soon as I sat down on the couch, every day, purring almost instantly.  I feel like I may have broken her heart.  How long did she wait in the bush, expecting me to come back for her?  

I'm actually crying now.  If cats could read, I wish I could tell them how sorry I am.  I needed to move to this city, and they couldn't come with me, but I should have made better arrangements for them.  Should have taken care of them like they meant something more to me than loose flotsam.  There would have been a way.  I just didn't look hard enough.

That's the worst thing I ever did."

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1390797793.0,"Eh, I'm more for UBI than a jobs program, although a jobs program would be VERY helpful to me, depending on its implementation.

Here's a few comparison points I've noticed.

1) Jobs guarantee is good for the short term, but UBI is a more long terms solution. A jobs guarantee is useful for providing employment NOW, and considering what I've seen about paying people to work in nonprofits and government and stuff, this would be GREAT for me, since it would finally give me an opportunity to do something with my degrees, but it's not sustainable compared to UBI for several reasons:

a) There may not be enough work to keep people always working, always busy. This will lead to people doing busy work for the sake of doing busy work.

b) JG would be more expensive for a lot of people who it SHOULDN'T be expensive for. While UBI can be worked equitably into the tax structure, employing people with JG takes money from people who works in the private sector and gives it to people who work in the public sector. Instead of it being a redistribution from rich to poor, it's a redistribution from private sector jobs to public sector ones. A lot of lower and middle class people will see higher taxes, but unlike with UBI, will not see any benefit. That being said, while I can see UBI supplementing peoples' wages, the jobs guarantee would just take money from some to give to others. And if you dont pay for it, that leads to higher deficits.

2) JG could be abused. To be fair, this is also true of UBI, but let me explain. Employers could use the JG as an excuse for cheap labor. If you don't make private sector people pay for jobs, they could just hire people for free like interns and dump the costs on the government. To be fair, this depends ultimately on implementation, but I think with both programs some level of cost externalizing should be monitored.

Beyond that, I think that they're kind of strawmanning UBI to a degree. As studies have shown, it really wont decrease production much....the fact that more production is happening with fewer people is a major reason we need it to begin with...these problems won't go away in the long term. 

Also, about UBI being inflationary...what's the difference between UBI being inflationary because it injects money into the economy and the jobs guarantee...is it a supposed measure of productivity? How exactly is productivity defined here? I mean, I can see a lot of JG jobs not really producing ECONOMIC value, but they would produce OTHER benefits. For example, I'd probably use a JG to go back and do volunteer work with my city i currently don't do because it doesn't pay. The kind of work I have in mind would not produce economic value, but it would produce societal value. I mean, from what I understand, the JG allows people to get paid for volunteer work and the like...this work really doesn't provide much economic value per se. Nothing is being produced, and money is changing hands for me to do something that has little economic but a lot of societal value. 

I just don't see the difference between giving people money and giving people money for work...how one is inflationary and one isn't. 

That being said, I wouldn't be opposed to a jobs guarantee in the short term. It would allow me to follow my passions instead of working some soul crushing private sector job I'm ill equipped for anyway, but I just don't see such a program as being sustainable in comparison with a UBI. I think in the long term UBI would be a much better solution."

I was shopping in the juniors section of stores. At that point, I was a bit heavier, fuller chest, but also short.

Now, at 29, I have changed my lifestyle to become more active. I am 30 lbs lighter, and actually find that because I am still short/petite, sometimes those same girls' or juniors' large sizes I struggled with 10-15 years ago actually fit better than clothes for full grown women.

This past Thursday, threatened to kill myself when she wasn't able to make it to my place because she had other plans. Ended up in the hospital on a 72-hour hold. She wants to distance herself and let me fix myself, because she is tired of being a crutch (and wanting to kill myself because she couldn't be at my place to hangout was the last straw) Also have been feeling really hopeless, helpless, and alone.

fatalcharm,AskReddit,1390798286.0,"This is going to be long, a lot of stuff has happened so I have to break it up into 3 parts.

When I was a child, around 10-11 I experienced a few paranormal things. Just stuff moving around on it's own, seeing dimension doors and a few telekinetic experiences (moving around a helium balloon with my mind, just silly stuff) and some crazy nightmares where I would look in a mirror and see a demon staring back at me. I was a child with a very active imagination then so I can't really trust what I was seeing. I was also going through a lot of hormonal changes (it was just before puberty) and I have heard that girls around that age have a lot of paranormal experiences.

When I was in my early to mid-twenties, I was going through a really hard time and wasn't in a good place mentally. I had some serious issues and was a messed up person. I have considered the fact that the things that I experienced were due to alcohol induced psychosis, but my ex (who doesn't believe in the paranormal) also saw a couple things with me that he couldn't explain and that makes me think that these things weren't just in my head.

At this point I was living with my ex boyfriends parents and staying in their basement, with my ex. One day I was in the bedroom, which was an absolute pigsty. With the mental state that I was in, I really had trouble cleaning the place up. Anyways, I had a mirror sitting on the floor, propped up against the wall. I wasn't looking directly at the mirror, but in it's general direction and saw a white flash in the reflection of the mirror. I didn't see it outside of the mirror, just in the reflection of the mirror. It almost looked like someone with a white sheet over their head walking past the mirror. Like the ghosts that you see in cartoons, or if you wanted to dress up as a ghost for a Halloween party, you would put a white sheet over your head. It honestly looked like a joke, but it was very clear.

Around that time, one day I was getting dressed near the basement stairs leading up to the house. I looked around at the stairs and saw a small white orb, slowly floating down the stairs heading towards me. This wasn't like a flash that I saw out of the corner of my eye, I was looking directly at it, and it floated down the stairs quite slowly and headed straight for me. 

I ran from it and jumped on my bed, because for some reason I thought my bed would be safer. Then I felt a cold hand grab my arm, I could feel it's fingers and everything and I flinched. Then I saw something heading towards me and looked at it. It was another white orb heading straight for my face, it hit me in the face and I felt this forceful puff of cold air in my face, almost like a punch, but with cold air. This really freaked me out and I think I left the house for a little while.

I also had a lot of experiences while trying to go to sleep, just hearing voices and my name being called and stuff. It scared me but I wasn't sure if I was just half asleep and dreaming. One day, I was having a nap through the day and in my half asleep state (I could have been experiencing sleep paralysis and probably was) I could feel someone hugging me tightly. In my mind I asked them ""Why are you hugging me so tightly?"" and they said back to me ""Because it's the simple things in life..."" -something along those lines. I fell back asleep. I probably was experiencing sleep paralysis and was half-dreaming, but there was something very strange and significant about it.

One night I was laying in bed, asleep next to my ex (who was my boyfriend at the time) and woke up suddenly and just stared at the TV (which was on, I like to sleep with the TV on because I get scared, lol) and there was a late-night news program on. The reporter was facing the camera and talking (obviously) and there were people in the background working, running around, whatever. Anyways, I was staring at the TV, and the white orb appeared on the TV! It just floated around the TV screen, but the strange thing was, that it floated behind the reporters head, as if it was in the newsroom. It was strange, so I woke up my boyfriend at the time and told him to look at it. He saw it but then the white orb disappeared. I asked the white orb ""Can you please come back and show us that again?"" and it did. It would float around the TV screen and then disappear. I asked it to show itself again, and it did and my ex saw it too. Every time I asked this white orb to show itself, it would, right on cue and after a while I said ""Thank you for showing yourself"" and then it disappeared and wouldn't come back. 

My ex saw it too and I explained to him ""That is what I have been seeing, but in the actual room with me and not on the TV screen"" and although he didn't believe in the paranormal, he agreed with me that it was really weird. We both went back to sleep.

Eventually we moved out of my ex's parents place and into our own place and that is when things started to get really bad. I would see black shadows hovering over me when I would lay down on the couch to watch TV, which really freaked me out. At night when I would be laying in bed, I could feel something really evil, hovering over me. I would hear howls and really scary growls. I felt like something bad was targeting me. It would kind of harass me and wouldn't leave me alone. I would hear my name being called, really scary voices but the sounds were coming from inside my head. It wasn't like I was hearing the sounds through my ears, the voices were literally in my head (so I did wonder if I was going crazy) and this thing would just hover over me, very close. I don't know how to describe it because I couldn't see it only feel it. It was a disgusting feeling and I felt like it could have been demonic or at least, very evil.

One night I woke up to something running over me and my bed, almost like a cat. I woke up and was in a state of sleep paralysis, so it really was like a dream but again, it seemed really significant. I was laying on my side, and I could see the body of a weird leathery creature, no bigger than a cat but couldn't see its head because it's head was near the top of mine. It was almost like it was eating away at my brain. I know that sounds strange, but that is the only way I could describe it. It was terrifying. I snapped out of my sleep paralysis and went in the lounge room to watch TV, with all the lights on. I couldn't go back to sleep after that."

fatalcharm,AskReddit,1390798331.0,"Another time my ex and I were sitting on the couch, watching TV and our little dog (an orange colored pomeranian) was sitting on her bed. Something ghost-like, but looking very similar to our pomeranian (same colour, same size) ran in from the front door, past my dog, past my ex's and mines feet, then into one of the bedrooms and kind of just disappeared. The strange thing about this was that as it ran past my dog, her head followed it as if she was watching it and as it ran past my ex, his head followed it too. I said to him, really excitedly ""Did you see that!"" and he said ""Yes, I thought it was Roxy (the name of our dog) at first, but she is right there!"" 

Eventually we moved out of that place and into another one. I still had paranormal experiences, and a feeling that something was there, but it was no where near as scary as what was at the last place. One day I was in the lounge room, doing something on my computer and looked up and saw the face of a young Asian child peering around the corner, looking at me. I blinked and it was gone. Another time I was walking to bed and I tripped over what seemed to be nothing (I am actually a clumsy person and do this all the time) I didn't think much of it until I heard a childs voice whispering quietly, but very clearly ""Sorry"" -I wasn't scared but I instantly thought that it was the voice of the child who's face I saw.

Eventually my boyfriend and I broke up and I moved back into my mothers house. I still had some scary, paranormal experiences, usually when I was trying to go to sleep but eventually they faded. It was actually when I started reading the Bible, that the experiences started to go away. I don't know if it was the fact that I had invited Jesus into my heart that made them go away, or the fact that reading the Bible brought me comfort and peace of mind. Either way, it worked and when I start feeling scared again, I just read the Bible or pray.

I still have paranormal experiences now, but they are much more positive. I astral project sometimes, I don't purposely do it, it just happens randomly but it is a lot of fun when it does happen."

One night she was at our house having drinks in the kitchen with mum, while I was upstairs in my bedroom. I could hear my mums friend, who was drunk, start getting quite aggressive towards my mum (she was the type who was always looking for a fight, no matter who it was with) and I stepped outside my room and listened, ready to call the police and jump in if my mum needed help. 

Then I had a bad feeling, and sensed that something wasn't right. Then I could hear big, heavy footsteps coming up the stairs but I couldn't see anything there. I ran to my room, shut the door and I think I prayed a bit. The heavy footsteps continued to walk up the stairs and towards my bedroom door and stopped right at my door. I wasn't willing to open the door to check what was there because I was scared that I would ""let it in"" For some strange reason, I could see who it was in my mind. It was a very large man, very tall and built and he was wearing big black boots. 

My mums friend eventually calmed down and went home. The next day I told my mum what I heard and saw (in my mind) and she went around and told her friend that I was very worried about her and I think that she had a negative entity attached to her (which is what I believed) and gave her some white sage incense to burn (at my request) and described to her friend what I saw in my mind. 

My mums friend laughed it off and said ""Don't worry, that is just my grandfather, he was a huge man and a butcher, he wore big black boots"" but I wasn't actually convinced that it was her grandfather. I think it might have been something else.

Eventually mums friend moved away and we lost touch with her, which was a good thing. My life is pretty quiet now and other than the odd astral projection experience, things are pretty normal."

For example, being a cop is a dangerous profession, and more men are cops than women. That doesn't mean I fucking blame the police officer for getting killed when some criminal shoots them. I'm just stating a fact: Men die more often at work because on average they have more dangerous jobs than women. 

Likewise, men find themselves in circumstances with a higher chance of getting mugged than women. But put a women and man in the same high risk circumstance, the women is the more likely victim because she's a ""softer target"".

No one is getting blamed for anything. No one is suggested to change their behaviour. It's just observations of what happens in society.

If what I'm doing is victim blaming, then why don't you tell me how I can describe what is happening in a way that your emotional ass doesn't start crying?"

balathustrius,AdviceAnimals,1390798603.0,"Forgive me for this, but there is so much *terrible* information out there about capsaicin. (Read through this, though; I'm not saying you're wrong.)

The biggest thing to remember is that capsaicin is an alkaline oil.

Think of how cold water doesn't get the oil off of a hot dish. Hot water can, eventually, but it's generally too hot to put in your mouth or on skin if it's hot enough to be useful, and even if you could without causing physical harm, I don't know a lot of people who would follow up burning peppers with painful hot water.

Washing your mouth and hands with *very* strong alcohol can work to some degree. I don't mean bourbon - I mean Everclear or moonshine. Capsaicin is alcohol soluble, so while some of it will be washed away, it will also be spread.

Acids are *the best* way to counter the effects of the alkaline capsaicin.

Oils are a mixed bag. You need an **acidic** oil. Vegetable, sunflower, corn, and hydrogenated oils qualify - all those will coat the surface and begin to neutralize the capsaicin. It can take a while to have an appreciable effect, so coat, rub, soak, and try not to spread it around outside of the burned area because oil will spread the capsaicin around a bit, even as it acts. After a good soak, wash with soap and repeat if necessary. Oils that will not work: Avacado, Olive, Coconut, Flax Seed, Grapeseed, Hemp, Omega 3-6-9.

Heavy dairy products are perhaps the best solutions. Sour cream, whipped cream, heavy cream, half and half, or whole milk. These are thick, fatty and acidic (lactic acid), which means they coat the effected area and begin to chemically break down the bonds between capsaicin and your taste buds. Bonus points if it's cold, as dairy products usually are, which will provide an immediate numbing effect."

HomelessPandas,relationships,1390798696.0,"From my experience, a TON of sexual chemistry is based on mutual physical attraction, I have been with girls solely because of their personalities as well. It's a brutal fact your boyfriend isn't as attracted you as he used to be. 

But on the other hand, if he grew a massive potbelly and double chin do you think you would be as turned on by him? I totally agree that in a relationship you have to accept each others flaws and characteristics. But from my experience, it's something you should work on together. If he wants your physique to improve, he should see what he can improve about himself as well. It has to be a give AND take.

For example, a year or so ago I was dating a girl for several months who was quite slender, but quit swimming competitively. She slowly began to gain weight, to the point that 4 or 5 months later, it was very noticeable. I never said a word to her, because I knew it would crush her if I told her I wasn't attracted to her. So instead I started working out a ton and always asking her to go to active things with me. I started eating super healthy food, and in turn she did as well. She subsequently lost a lot the weight, and our relationship only got better. Then she cheated on me. Anyways, moral of the story, your man is kind of being a douche by just straight up telling you he doesn't like your stomach. I would never say that to a woman, but hey maybe I'm weird.

Gear-bragging (or shaming) is pointless. Our cameras are tools—nothing else. They are not our art, our skill, or our work.

TheEquivocator,AskWomen,1390798859.0,"&gt; Like males get to be ""guys"" and ""men"" at a much younger age and women are still ""girls."" It's a subtle and oftentimes unconscious thing which serves to reinforce that men are mature and dominating and ""girls"" are still young maybe need to be taken care of.

I disagree with how you interpret this. ""Guys"" and ""men"" are not the same thing. ""Guy"" is pretty much equivalent to ""girl"" in the sense of a young, usually unmarried adult. ""Girl"" happens to be the feminine counterpart both of ""boy"" and of ""guy"", but just because it's used for both stages of life doesn't mean it equates the two.

I won't say your feelings are invalid—everyone has his or her own idiolect of the language and words mean to you what they mean to you—but I will say I don't think you should automatically assume that everyone who calls a 22-year-old woman a ""girl"" thinks of her (even subconsciously) as more juvenile than a 22-year-old ""guy""."

sleepyj910,DebateAnAtheist,1390798887.0,"I would ask if supernatural belief is essential to the benefits of religious behavior, asides the persistence of it.

Thing is, any behavior rooted in falsehood is ripe for corruption as every religion has proven, and leaders can reimagine it to their own designs and none can challenge the unchallengeable.  Any idea put on a pedestal, beyond criticism, is corruptible.

Armstrong tries to deflect fundamentalism as not the purpose of religion, which may be true, but it is encoded in religion nonetheless.  Any system based on supernatural belief will be corrupted because there is no baseline for truth.

So her criticism of new atheism is basically a huge dodge to me, as she refuses to acknowledge that the horrors caused by modern religions are inevitable when a system is not based in reality.

In the end, I maintain that all benefits of religious behavior, the community, art, the emotional support.  All of it can be had without supernatural belief.  Otherwise, the harm of superstition will always outweigh the benefits of the spirituality of religion.

Furthermore, she may claim that truth was never the point of religion, but truth is the power of religion.  It can not grow without belief, and it can not maintain belief without claims of truth.

Armstrong is a giant in the 'God is for feeling good' line of thinking, but she fails to grasp that that's really not  how most believers, believers who really do care what's true, think of their religion. It takes a special person to say truth does not matter and that seems to be the crux of her argument.

Without truth, there is no morality, because we are ignorant of the consequences of our actions.  People who seek morality always seek the truth."

Coming from someone that has been cheated on and fucked over by girls, I went straight to that guy and told him.

Cougs67,nfl,1390799094.0,"Doubtful. Broncos don't have all that great of a defense. Their pass defense is awful, so that should open things up for Marshawn if we get the pass game going.

BigFishMcNish,DenverBroncos,1390799096.0,"We're not on the same page. 

The word ""timing"" in an innate sense applies to every thing ever. It's physics.

 But in a curl route for example, the quarterback plans to be in an exact spot in his dropback at the same time the wr is in an exact spot, then  the qb throws the ball with the wr's back still to the LOS, as he turns around, performing a 180, the ball arrives exactly in his hands. On a slant route, the QB can choose to throw it any point during the stretch of the slant.. just whenever it seems most advantageous for a completion. The execution of the pass requires the quarterback to time the ball with the receiver's stride so it arrives on target just like a point guard would time a pass to someone running up court on an outlet. It wasn't preordained that the PG said, ""ok you have to be ten feet before half court because that's were I'm putting the ball at 'x' time"" 

What I was arguing that timing routes in the sense that everyone is on cue (receivers and qb) for a certain pass at a *specific* portion of the route everytime is not what our offense counts on. Russ can't even get consistent passing lanes so attempting that would mean sure failure. 

It's expanding our chance of success by not limiting the pass to a narrow window of time."

Nelerath8,AskWomen,1390799143.0,"It's disheartening to read through the comments how many women have had issues on these dating websites, not only for your guys sake but for mine as a male trying to use one.

I've sent out 58 messages (ALL of them different and centered around the girl's profile) during my time with OkCupid and received 3 responses, one of rejection which I really appreciated actually, and two where the we traded back and forth before the woman on the other end lost interest and just stopped replying. Granted I am a very quirky guy so I've joked with my friends my profile page probably actively scares women away.

But I am sorry to hear you guys are getting harassed like that. Tis really unfortunate for I think both sides, as males are given a bad reputation and females are just being harassed.

Though to the people who got good messages and just didn't want anything to do with the guy due to his profile, why not give him a chance? Personally (and maybe it's because I am on the seeking and not the receiving end) if a girl messaged me with a well worded message I'd at least give her the benefit of a conversation before turning her down. Who knows maybe they're just horrible at writing about themselves."

Get away from this guy before you get deeper in. I can tell you from personal experience it will only get worse. I forgave a girl for cheating on me twice, only to have her leave me for the first guy she cheated on me with. I built her up in my head like she was some sort of damaged angel that was just making mistakes. Don't do that. Accept that he's a douche and move on. It took me almost a year to really move on after how fucked up that girl left me.

Even if something is wrong with your relationship that leaves him unhappy, there is no excuse for this guy fucking around this much or at all actually. He should have the guts to just end it, or control himself. Save your effort and forgiveness for someone that actually deserves it."

I ended up leaving that job for a better one with nicer benefits, and I make pretty good money, bonus every three months,  and am working toward a promotion. 

I live in a nice, two bedroom apartment,  even though its just me. Considering looking for a home in the next few years. And have fallen in love with someone who is one of the most amazing people I've ever met.

kiwirish,baseball,1390799822.0,"2004 ALCS: Boston lose the first 3 games and appear to go on to lose the 4th only for Big Papi to bail them out and win in extra innings. Only to do it again in the 5th game, before clawing back to 3-3 going into an unbelievable game 7 blowout to win 4-3 after going down 0-3. This has literally never happened on NBA history. In fact in the finals a team that has gone down 0-2 has never won.

Then Boston went on to win the World Series for the first time since WWI was still fresh in our minds. This has also not happened in a long time in the NBA. 

And the 2013 playoffs for the NHL were far better than the NBA, Toronto dropping a 4-1 lead in a Game 7 to lose 5-4 to Boston in OT when Boston score TWO goals with a pulled goalie. The LA/StL series where every game was decided by one goal. The LA/SJ series that went to 7 games where the home team won every game. The LA/Chicago series where Chicago won the series in 2OT. The Detroit/Chicago series that went to game 7.

2012 NHL playoffs: 8 seed Los Angeles beat 1, 2, 3 in the West and then the East Champions to win the Stanley Cup, going 16-4 and 10-1 on the road, going up 3-0 in every series to get their first Championship in 45 years.

Sorry but the NBA playoffs can't come close to the NHL playoffs. And the MLB at least offers more than 2 teams a year to win. March Madness had Butler make the NCG two years in a row from a tiny mid-major conference, VCU made the Final Four. FGCU made the Sweet Sixteen, Wichita State went to the Elite Eight. Two years ago Duke lost to Lehigh and Mizzou lost to another #15 seed, BYU had the biggest ever NCAA tourney comeback win over Iona. Gonzaga got to #1 and then failed in the tourney.

When the NHL, MLB and March Madness give me these kind of stories you have to forgive me for not really caring about the NBA."

He feels that despite you not asking him to give up his career to stay with you, he made a serious investment into the relationship. It's not that you *owe* him anything, but that he expects similar investments into the relationship, so in a sense he may resent you not valuing the relationship as much as he does. I think that that is not unreasonable to expect. It's NOT that he wants to hold you back, or anything like that, he just hates the fact that you don't want to make the same investment(and at 19 years old, that's a totally reasonable choice).

Now, as far as long distance relationships go, I do not recommend it. That same girl and I tried to make it work for 8 months and it was one of the most catastrophic and painful endings to a relationship I have ever had. She cheated on me with a guy she met, and it strung out for another 3 dysfunctional months. So if you can, end it on good terms, leaving things open down the road.

It's unfortunate, because if you listen to a lot of the lyrics of rap, a lot of artists decry the violence of their communities, the cycle of poverty they see their friends trapped in, and the circumstances that made them chose drugs and gangs over going straight.

Of course, nobody listens to the lyrics. I don't even think they listen to Macklemore's lyrics. They just seem to listen to the criticism of ""black culture"" and the praise heaped on white rappers, and take their music taste from there.

Kind of like how some people go through that ""edgy"" faze where they only like tried-and-true arena Dad Rock, because nobody dislikes it and everyone who seems to know what they're talking about likes it. It's not so much having your own taste in music as it is trying to develop a taste in music that is a persona of class and sophistication."

Winter: Astonishingly cold, but rarely any ""real"" amounts of snow. Plow service is too good, can't have any fun while driving. Road salt corrodes the shit out of cars.

Spring: Mud, rain, cold, and plants. As someone allergic to 90% of plant life, fuck spring.

Summer: Blazing heat and a massive fuckton of mosquitoes. While not as hot as, say, Arizona, the constant temperature contrast leaves us constantly mal-adjusted to the current temperature. Minnesota has more lakes than pretty much any other contingent U.S. state if I remember correctly. 

Fall: Now that you're just gotten used to the heat, let's make things cold again! Raking leaves is really fucking annoying. Dead leaf particles trigger my asthma. More plants like Ragweed start spreading pollen, more allergies.

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1390800277.0,"&gt; From my perspective, I can easily imagine an all-girl subreddit that looks quite a bit like TRP in how they talk about men, just with some tweaks to the language, but mostly keeping the vocabulary the same. It's all too easy to picture women talking about what men want, what they're likely to do, how AMALT and will leave you if a better option presents itself, and matching just about any other claim that the Red Pill has ever made, just in reverse.

You don't have to find an all-girl subreddit for that. Head off to your local major bookstore chain, and look in the Relationships aisle. Vast majority are written for women and often use controversial language and generalizations. 

&gt; So, can these terms apply to both men and women? If not, why?

The terms are generally different and gender-specific, I've found. For an obvious example, it's not really possible to talk about how women's *""little boy glands""* control them, because that term doesn't apply to them. Just as it's obviously not possible to talk about how men are influenced by their *""gina tingles""*."

wnoise,askscience,1390800348.0,"One can never make it to the speed of light given any length of finite acceleration.  The speed of light is in many ways equivalent to ""infinitely fast"", and hence unreachable.  (In many ways it's not, of course.)  One way of formalizing this is with the notion of ""rapidity"", commonly denoted *r*.  You may have learned in that in special relativity, you can't just add velocities.  Rapidities are the things you can add (though only if they're pointing in the same or opposite directions), and the speed of light is an infinite rapidity.  The relationship between rapidity and velocity is v/c = tanh (r/c), with conventions chosen such that small rapidities equal small velocities.  This also mean that the acceleration (rate of change of velocity) will be the same as rate of change of rapidity with respect to the accelerator's time.  Unfortunately, it won't be the same for outside observers.

If you want to get to 99% of the speed of light, we can tell that you need a rapidity of v/c = 0.99 = tanh(r/c), so you need a rapidity of 2.646 c, which at 1g means you experience T = 2.646 c / 9.8 m/s/s = 80.9 million seconds, or about 2.56 years.

How long it takes relative to someone else is a different, and much harder question, since the time dilation you experience changes all through out the acceleration.

It is, however, solvable, and the answer is t = (c/a) sinh(a T/c) = (c/a) sinh (r/c), or about 7.2 years externally.

abcd_z,asktrp,1390800423.0,"I see two sticking points here.  The first is in the initial approach, and the second is when you want to meet her again.  

The only time to be worried about your initial approach expressing interest is if she acts like a bitch to you for no good reason (the ""bitch shield"").  This normally only happens at clubs or bars.  You shouldn't have this problem when running day game.  

As I recall a pickup artist named Mystery had a whole system designed around extremely attractive woman at clubs and bars.  Since they were normally in groups with other people he would tell stories and engage the entire group while acting aloof or uninterested from the woman he was interested in, then let her win him over.  

However, if you aren't dealing with a bitch shield when you approach, you don't need to do any of that.  

The second sticking point, trying to see her again, expresses interest.  I'm sorry, there's nothing you can do to change that.  What you *can* do is make her feel like she's earned it.  

Mystery had something called Bait Hook Reel Release, which is a way to qualify a woman without letting the line go slack, so to speak:  

&gt;  BHRR is simply:  
&gt; 1. Ask a question that she'll eagerly respond to. (no facts - something feeling or interesting or chick crack)  
&gt; 2. Get her response.  
&gt; 3. Tell her that's awesome. Genuinely. Appreciate what she said.  
&gt; 4. And then interpret what she said in any way you can think of (that's not silly) to disqualify her.  

&gt; I know 4 is the tricky part, but it's not hard. Genuinely take a beat after you've said she was cool, and feel how what she said could be bad, and then just tell her how it could be bad. She'll qualify like MAD.  

&gt; Swinggcat's ""I don't believe you"" is great, but it works once. You can't keep saying ""I don't believe you."" Whereas you can BHRR like 3 or 4 times usually without her noticing. I've had the occasional girl say, ""stop."" But that's rare, and if you do, I immediately DHV once or twice to get her mind OFF that pattern.

keyo_,newzealand,1390800498.0,"Agreed. We need to be giving the children the benefits directly. Food and nurses in schools is good. Finland provides parents with a box full of baby clothes, a small mattress, nappies etc. I support this because eventually it pays off with less crime and a more educated population.

However this policy is stupid. The disadvantaged kids are this way because their parents are not the brightest at handling money. The parents can spend this extra money on whatever they want, so it doesn't necessarily help the kids at all. This is on top of the working for families tax credits which give tax money to families so their kids can grow up to drain the worlds resources. We have enough population growth without incentivising it.

Labour does have plans to increase the affordability of comfortable homes which is good for most of people. I just wonder how effective their policy will be. It seems like they're just after headlines."

I also think that the ~~650m~~ 750m is seriously underpowered on these current rMBP's. The 765m would have been more appropriate. With these retina displays needing a significant amount of graphical power, Apple needs to put better GPU's in the Macbook pro. 

While we're on that topic, why not release a 17"" rMBP with dual GPUs? 

Edit: I meant the 750m.


Comparison of the 650m, 750m, and 765m: 

GPU:|650m|750m|765m

ThePinkPanther2,AskWomen,1390800653.0,"If the roles were reversed, I'd tell him to leave me and choose his career. He would probably regret it far more, and for much longer, than losing me. Especially if his self-esteem is more tied to his career, wanting to make a difference in the world, and to other people's validation on his field of work and his intelligence. 

The thought of my hard earned degree becoming useless in another city, is unfortunate. But my choice would be different, considering that my self-esteem is centered on doing good work (in general) than making a difference in the world or having a ""dream"" career. In this situation, for myself, I'd choose him because I don't usually hold onto regrets. Once I make a choice there is little chance of looking back and regretting it. I'd pack up and move to his city across the world. 

Security and stability are very important to me, so my decision wouldn't be taken lightly. I would hate to be a burden, so I might have to take up two jobs. Even with assurances that I could easily find a new ""dream career"" in a new city ..I wouldn't bank on it until the papers are signed.  Thankfully, I don't consider any work to be beneath me so applying for odd jobs and working twice as hard is not completely unpleasant. I worry more about a support system (family, friends) in a new area because I don't want to be out on my ass without help in case the relationship fails. 

If there are any doubts whatsoever that the relationship is rocky, that the communication isn't strong enough, I'd have to choose my career.  If my university degree was incredibly expensive and location specific, I'd choose my career. If I knew there was no hope for a marriage proposal down the line, I'd choose my career. "
Devium92,BDSMcommunity,1390800653.0,"My BF(Dom) and I used to (life and illness got in the way) have ""Wednesdays"". He texted me right near the end of my shift at work (night shift) with a few expectations:

1) shower right when I get home, dress only in a skirt (shorts would work if I couldn't find any skirts since we had recently moved)

2) while he showered I was to find our restraints, if I couldn't find those, find his ties (again recently moved. Had already located the ties, but not the restraints)

3) make him tea and toast, make some for myself if I so desired

4) I was to serve him his tea and toast when he got out of the shower.

5) when he was nearly done his tea and toast I was to go to our bedroom, remove my skirt, tie my hands behind my back and bend over the bed and wait for him.

This was to become a weekly thing (with the exception of *that* week) and that I was to always do this unless told otherwise. I would not get a prompt or a reminder, I was to remember that it was Wednesday and to make him his breakfast etc etc.

This eventually changed to Saturdays as our work shifts changed and we weren't able to do this on Wednesday mornings anymore.

Find some daily, or semi-daily ritual that she is to remember. Give her some leeway the first few times but then it is expected for her to remember. Makes for some fun if she has something she really enjoys as that can be a reward for doing everything the way she is supposed to on the first week without a reminder.

HomelessPandas,relationships,1390800716.0,"I've been cheated on twice in my life, and it was by the same girl. You are walking on incredibly thin ice my friend. And trust me, I know exactly how shitty and dejected you feel. 

My ex was the same thing, a sexually abused girl who was tragically damaged. She's a sweetheart, she's smart and caring, but deeply flawed. I forgave her after a couple weeks(way too short) We slowly rebuilt our relationship, and things seemed to be going great, but then her flaw came again. She fucked another guy, again something like 8 months later. I didn't speak to her for months on end, and eventually she showed up at my door in tears, and gave the most convincing tear filled apology and literally begged to have me back in her life. Eventually (3 months later), we hit the same spot, and I just knew that she would cheat again. So I left her. And sure enough, a couple weeks later she started dating the first guy she cheated with me on.

Moral of the story, be very, very careful. But man, you're 20 years old, don't spend too much time or effort on this chick. I don't personally like to burn bridges, but that's up to you. I was exactly your age when this shit was happening to me, and my girlfriend was a year younger than me as well. She may not be a bad person, but at this time, she probably really just isn't the right person for you. "

shalashaskatoka,AskMen,1390800837.0,"Well first of all, nobody should be hitting anyone. Gender is irrelevant . That being said, I had a thought.  
  
 Why *do* women hit men? Its escalating a confrontation to a point that they typically cant handle. If a girl punches you in the face, she will most certainly cause some damage. Face shots always do damage. But, it wont compare to the damage  the guy does when he punches *her* in the face.  Its kinda like why I wouldn't even dream of hitting a guy thats bigger than I am unless I am damn near 110% confident that after I do he cant fight back. I have no idea why a woman would hit a man and escalate the situation to a point that they cant handle. I'm not trying to pull the ""Women are weak"" card here, I'm just bringing up a  difference in biology.   
  
I have thicker bones, denser muscle fibers and a skeletal structure thats a bit better for striking. Why on earth would you start a physical fight when your bones are more brittle and your muscle tone does not compare? This seems like insanity. Yea, the guy has a 99% chance of going to jail, but payback or not, is it worth possibly getting your jaw broken and or always being in pain when you chew?Or worse depending on how you hit the ground? This cost/ benefit analysis is the same for men as well, but the chances of severe injury is just higher for women in this situation. If a guy wants to fight another guy,the potential bodily damage you are going to take in  doing so is taken into consideration. The "" Can I take this guy?' calculation.  
  
Considering the facts, you would think that stories of women hitting me first would be very low, but for some reason its not unheard of. I would have to say that the last thing I would ever want to do as a woman is fight a man, absolute last thing I would want to do  is stake the state of my face on him being genteel and not going off on me. Then again, the last thing I would want to do is fight a woman without an athletic cup."

I always had this idea that I was uncomfortable touching women because I never did it. It turns out it's not that uncomfortable at all. What is uncomfortable is doing it where it actually means something. So now, I feel pretty comfortable touching women in most situations you would end up in during a dance, but I'm still a bit unsure of myself when it comes to touching when it's meant only to express affection. Still, it's a step forward.

The funny thing, though, is that I really like dancing. I never would have expected it. I mean, I'm as white as they come and not Latino at all. I don't think there's as much as a drop of Spanish blood in me. I love it, though. I don't know that it's for everyone, but I do think everyone should try it."

It's not the fact that they do it in the first place, it's that they overdo it when they're younger.

At a young age their body can recover quicker, it doesn't show on their face, they can continuously live that lifestyle.

As they get older it catches up to them (visually).  They become fat, their faces start to show their age, and most importantly a new wave of younger, prettier girls have taken their place.

They then become desperate since they've hit ""the wall.""

I suppose Friedman is looking at the scenario as a ""lesser of two evils"" kind of thing. In either case, *someone's* rights are going to be violated. By respecting the rights of the rifle owner to use his gun however he wishes, many people in the theater will die. Of course it's not *because of* the gun owner's stinginess, it's because of the murderer's actions. Regardless, I think many people will agree that it is morally good to temporarily steal the man's gun in order to protect the theatergoers. The conflict is in the goodness of stealing the gun to save many lives versus the evilness of committing the theft to do so. That is Friedman's contradiction; however it translates to the law and to property rights is based on how one defines those rights."

Nausved,FeMRADebates,1390801240.0,"I played World of Warcraft, Horde-side, a few years ago. When selecting a character, I knew I wanted to play a female (since I am female, and because female characters are under-played on the Horde side), and I opted for an orc.

I thought they were the coolest looking of the female characters—and, indeed, [better looking than most of the (rather cartoony looking) male options.](http://www.devilwearstransmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mailtransmog_marauder_orc.jpg) I also appreciated that they looked very believably strong and rough.

My orc character was a reflection of who I wanted to be in the game world: a rough, durable, independent (I played a hunter, which is a solo-oriented class), and very orc-ish survivalist. Sexy or fashionable was definitely not a part of that equation. I actually really liked a lot of the early crappy leather armors, because they perfectly fit the *feel* of the game for me, the *feel* of the sort of character I wanted to experience WoW with.

Unfortunately, that didn't last long. I was eventually forced to wear all kinds of sexy, elaborate, colorful bikini-like armor—due to the better stats—which I found pretty disappointing. It robbed me of a certain amount of immersion and freedom. The game kind of stopped being fun when I felt I was increasingly being artificially funneled down a path I didn't want to take my character. (That, combined with the sheer amount of grinding I had to do to be able to occasionally play alongside my friends, led me to cancel my subscription after a few months.)

I don't mind the *option* of sexy clothes. After all, if I'd been wanting to play a sexy character, I would have been pretty thrilled. But in this case (and most cases where I play games), that wasn't what I was after. There are *tons* of ways for female characters to look interesting, mysterious, cool, unusual, etc.—besides just looking sexy. But sexy is typically the only option, or the only option that's suitably fleshed out enough to be appealing. And that sucks.

Don't get me wrong, my complaint for male characters is not meaningfully different. I'f I'd planned to play a tough, survivalist *male* character in World of Warcraft, I'd have been very disappointed with my options, too; decorative, gleaming armor and [a body builder aesthetic](http://www.upitems.com/images/news/orc.jpg) don't exactly fit the way I'd envisioned my WoW experience."

Have you seen any foreign or silent films? Anything made before 1966? Anything in black and white? Any experimental films, shorts, animation, or documentaries? Forgive me, but it appears that you just retyped the most popular movies from IMDB's Top 250: a sort of ""Serious"" Movies 101 without much grasp of the true diversity of the medium. 

I'm not a professional critic, but I've seen enough films to know that the idea of ""objective"" quality in film, or any art for that matter, is tenuous at best. There's nothing testable to art and there really aren't any concrete goals to it beyond making money and maybe the impossible-to-quantify audience reaction of being ""inspired"" or ""swept away.""  When you make hyperbolic claims like your view of proper story structure being confirmed by ""every author there is,"" you've truly reached the limits of exaggerating the stability of conventions in artistic practices. The idea of this level of consensus among creators of any stripe is absurd.

I haven't seen The Wolf of Wall Street and cannot comment on it, but your inflexible, un-nuanced, and dismissive tone in evaluating it is not particularly persuasive. And I get the impression that you went in with your opinion already settled."

mountainunicycler,AdviceAnimals,1390801521.0,"Gluten intolerance is not a disease. Gluten sensitivity is not a disease. Celiacs is a disease. 

Intolerance and sensitivity to gluten have effects on the bacteria living in the gut, meaning it's more similar to a fructose sensitivity than celiacs. Fructose can, in some patients, encourage growth of unhelpful bacteria that can cause gastro issues, which is basically the same as a gluten sensitivity. Celiacs is an autoimmune disease. "

I wouldn't think your chances are high just because you only had oral sex with her.

&gt; How do I go about getting tested?

It's simple. ;) You tell your doctor what you did and ask what tests you should get.

&gt; I am very concerned

I know the feeling, as I myself have been through fears of an STI from unprotected oral sex. However, what you should know is that even if you get super-mega-duper-double HIV, you'll be just the same kind of person you were before the super-mega-duper-double HIV. 

If you learn something from what you did, you've been successful.

True, but you need super durability for *any* sort of super speed.  That's another one of those things a lot of writers gloss over/don't think much about (with the obvious exception of Speed Force).

SAIUN666,AskMen,1390801552.0,"It's the [just-world fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis) that so many people have.

* The world is fair, therefore
* People who fail aren't trying hard enough

People who have succeeded want to believe it's because they tried real hard and made it because of their efforts. It's a scary thought that the world can throw you lemons even if you give it your all. 

Those kind of attitudes become a bit of an echo chamber due to [survivorship bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). Successful people talk to other successful people about how hard they tried and that's why they succeeded, and all the other successful people agree that they also put in lots of effort - so that must be why they're all so successful.

If you want to point the finger at those who've failed it's so easy to pick on anything: do you work out/go to the gym? Do you ask out every woman you meet? Are you the most charming man ever?

*Why not? Why aren't you trying? You're not putting in any effort.*"

You probably already know all of that, and fixing your insecurities is no easy matter. If i were you I would straight up tell her how much you care about her, how much you care about the relationship, how much you trust her, and *then* how you don't want your insecurities to hurt it.

I am not very good working under pressure though. I am actually terrible at it. I go into a blank state where I can't think of anything. My mind just goes completely blank, not good if you are in a high-pressure situation.

I say that I have a good memory, but sometimes I forget how to spell the most simple words and sometimes I even forget how to write a number... Like the number ""5"" which gets me a lot. I don't know why, but sometimes I just forget what the number 5 looks like and I end up drawing a number 2 or 7 instead, then I think ""no, that's not right"" and try again.

This is actually a problem for me at work, because I work in a cafe and I'm the one who writes the specials on the chalk boards. Usually the price will be $7.95, $9.95 or $11.95 and occasionally I think ""oh sh*t, I have forgotten how to do the number 5 again"" and will either waste a few minutes trying to figure it out, or have to go and ask someone which is incredibly embarrassing when you are 30 years old and come across as somewhat intelligent."

Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone. Which I know you agree with. I was a Reformed Presbyterian intern for awhile. Well the premise of grace alone is that God is completely free and can do whatever he wants (unconditional election). **How do you know that God hasn't started a work of grace among the Muslims by the prophethood of Muhammad?** He clearly turned the people from polytheism and sin to monotheism and asserted that Jesus was the Word of God, a Spirit sent from him, and they eagerly await Jesus return before the end of days. They aren't really much different than the Thessalonians who thought the resurrection of the dead had already happened.

You go to a body and you pick up a gun, and you put it on your back and walk away. Thats what happens for YOU. For other people, because of the desync, it still shows up there. So THEY take it, and carry it away.

Then the sever checks what is going on and slogs through all the desync and sees you took it, but then also sees that someone else took it more recently. because its more recent, it takes this as the 'right' one (because it triggers first) and gives the item to the second player.

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,Music,1390802090.0,"I'm not sure it's fair to judge a studio album to a live recording. Live music  is about the connection of the performer with the audience. Therefore the true comparison would be a studio version vs hypothetically being in the audience for this performance, which would you prefer? 

A truly amazing performer has the ability to take over an entire audience and force them to do their bidding and feel what they want them to feel. Little things like brief pauses or being slightly off pitch don't matter when the performer already owns the audience. That is what happened here. I don't think I've ever seen people in the front row of a major awards ceremony stand up and dance during a performance. 

A beautifully mastered recording can be technically stunning, but I'm not sure it can ever match the power of hearing the music performed live. And trying to force a live performance to be as perfect as a recording is missing the forest for the trees. I agree with you that when listening to recorded music I usually prefer the studio versions as opposed to live recordings because that intimate connection isn't there, so those small technicalities do start to add up. There are a few that can surpass this (I'll say Nirvana Unplugged is the best example). But if you are truly comparing what is better, you have to factor in the element of...well, heart and soul I guess would be the best description. You have to take into account the heart and soul that a performer bleeds into a live performance that a recording can never truly capture. "

It's fine if you want to dress in this style of chunky shoes + black skinnies (nothing wrong with that aesthetic), but this execution of it is below average. It is not remarkable enough to belong in OP's album, that was my point.

Neopopulas,dayz,1390802120.0,"I'm just agreeing. Ghosting is really hard to prove as well, and actually much less annoying - to me - than combat logging. Ghosting can be avoided by just keeping on the move. If you engage someone, and they combat log (or if they don't) you should keep on the move so they don't know where you are anyway. If they log out to ghost you, and you move, then they're screwed.

Combat Logging is SO much worse, at least three times in the past week i've had someone shoot at ME from bushes, or a building, and then when i shoot back, they log out.

THEY SHOT AT ME, and then logged out when i shot back, it wasn't even like 'shit i'm being shot at where are they fuck log out' ... they start shit and them log out when they don't kill me instantly

That is the WORST example of combat logging i have ever seen and it drives me mad.

2.) Why were you walking down the street alone behind a woman? You should have know you'd be perceived as a rapist and taken measures to ensure you'd be with friends, thus preventing people from thinking you're a rapist.

3.) Did you clearly tell the woman that you're NOT a rapist. Without clearly saying you're not, you cannot be mad at the woman for assuming that you ARE in fact a rapist.

Look I'm not trying to BLAME you for being labelled as a potential rapist, but it's just irresponsible not to take all the steps available to you to not be labelled a rapist. That's just common sense."

dianthe,samoyeds,1390802334.0,"I'm totally with you on everything you said apart from: ""If they're breeding show dogs, there is a lot less chance of inbreeding etc"" - most show breeders do inbreed so that certain traits they like stick in the line, it's called line breeding or genotype breeding. There are also breeders (much more rare) who do phenotype breeding by outcrossing, phenotype breeding is when you breed two dogs with similar good traits so that those traits stick in the line, but the two dogs are not from the same line themselves. For example my female comes from very well known show lines and she is a product of a pretty tight line breeding... I keep debating whether I should stick to line breeding her (once she is a champion and has all her health testing out of the way) or do phenotype breeding to introduce some new genes. 

Basically with line breeding it is much easier to ensure consistency, with phenotype breeding it's more difficult and requires a lot of research.

naimnotname,girls,1390802626.0,"&gt; also damn is this show even supposed to be feminist anymore? it feels like every single female character is a sociopath and every male character is moral and honorable. 

If we're being realistic, a feminist show shouldn't depict all their women characters as super strong people who almost always get it right. If they dumbed the male characters down to the level most of the 4 girl ensemble is at, they'd have no credibility and the show would jump a sperm whale. (Sharks are passe.) 

The writing doesn't forgive these particular females because they represent a sizeable portion of metropolitan girls in their 20s that Sex and the City so miserably failed at. These girls aren't prone to being responsible, because as a person in their 20s myself, no one is responsible. They just learn. Give it a few more seasons. You'll see what you're looking for.

Keep in mind the 〜がい construction on its own is a grammatical noun. Also, やりがい, from やる、is a common word meaning 'reason it's worth doing something' that comes from this construction.Also, it can't necessarily be used with every verb (it's a bit idiomatic) so in this case ('there's no point in going to see it') most people would probably use a different idiom with 価値 that follows the same pattern, i.e. 

見に行く価値がない (there's no point in going). or 見に行くには価値がない。

ClearArmor,TheRedPill,1390802652.0,"Once you've had kids with a girl, lived with her, and all that, you're in deep enough that married/unmarried makes zero difference.  The law can own you whether you like it or not.  She can still take your ass to court and she can still get child support and whatever.  So maybe being unmarried will make it harder for her to take your couch and half your silverware.  Big deal.  She still gets max 18 years of stipend (your money) and you still are going to have to deal with having a child or maybe several.  All the redpill theory in the world isn't going to change your reality when that happens.  And from personal experience I can tell you that having kids is awesome and is worth not missing.  The question is simply how to manage it and who you create those possibilities with.  If you make sure to stay the unmarried route with your babymama, then be prepared to be an accessory father.  Courts will give her full custody and you very little visitation.  But it seems to me the sentiment here is to embrace life, take charge, and lead.  That means leading your [broken] family and taking part in raising your kids to see truth.  Letting your hamstering babymama jack your kids up while collecting money from you, all the while excluding you from participating as a father is just retarded.  That is your family so you gotta fight for them.  So, when you're in that deep, marriage is not the enemy.  And divorce isn't the end of the world either.  Lots of happily divorced dads around... because then you get the best of both worlds as I see it, a family like married dudes have and your freedom like bachelor guys have.  Just a thought."

Coming with no preconceived notions about UHT, I actually didn't find it to be bad at all.

I think we tend to forget that most people's standards of good and bad are pretty specific to the dominant culture in which they live in. I understand we're in /r/coffee whose unofficial purpose is to apply objective standards to coffee by applying ""science"" to the preparation of the drink. But ultimately, taste in food is something just as subjective as taste in music, and as long as something tastes good to the people who consume it, what right do we have to argue that our concept of what their food should be is superior to their concept?

Then there is the fear that your feelings won't be returned, and you will have wasted your heart's energy. But the awesome thing is that no matter how tired your heart ends up feeling, it never really quits. The right person at the right time will always get it going again. 

One thing a friend told me was that if you don't have the courage to ask someone out or the time to be romantic, try being good friends. You will get to know them, and get to spend time with them. Sometimes just getting to know someone is enough to find out enough about them to decide either they were not right for you or you could find your self in love."

Lostfiniel,California,1390803112.0,"I haven't heard anything locally about mandatoy restrictions on our water. Nothing from city or county government. Honestly though, in my household we have already been at a minimum of water usage for years having known that California faces these issues normally. I'm in an apartment with no plants, we take short showers and take care not to waste water on light loads of dishes or laundry. 

If you're concerned about your landscaping, you could do what my family did years ago and replace a lot of it with drought resistant plants, rock gardens, etc. That's saved them a lot of water and, at least down here, allows for native plants to remain part of the landscape.

One thing to point out as well is that Southern California has already spent large amounts of money on infrastructure to maintain water storage. [This article](http://www.signaltribunenewspaper.com/?p=22436) goes into it a bit. 

We have also been asked to voluntarily reduce our water usage here by 20-30% and there has been information put out there on water wise practices. If the voluntary reductions don't yield good enough results, it's very likely that we could be looking at mandatory restrictions.

Having always lived in Southern California I remember growing up with conservation and saving water being pushed on us pretty heavily. The city I grew up in was always trying to obtain a desalinization plant and other cities have invested in water reserves. The differences you are seeing right now between Northern and Southern California are likely the differences between a region that has already been facing drought conditions for decades and a region that normally doesn't have as much cause to worry.

Juz16,Civcraft,1390803611.0,"I originally went to be one of the founding players of /r/MinerApocalypse with the goal of creating something that would become what Civcraft is now. I had dreamed of a server like this for as long as I had known about Minecraft where emergent gameplay that came about from pure player-to-player interaction led to an amazing gaming experience.

Needless to say, the balance issues in vanilla Minecraft made griefing on MinerAp way to OP, and people refused to deal with it. I was then told in a PM conversation on reddit about /r/McApoc, which was *even closer* to achieving the goal of pure player-to-player emergent gameplay. It used the classic and well known Towny mod to encourage people to work together while discouraging griefing. It even required you to sink resources into keeping your town protected, eerily reminiscent of Citadel.

However, the community over there wasn't large enough to have the ""critical mass"" of a self-sustaining community. Many people don't realize it, but the /msg command is crucial to the survival of a Minecraft community. Nobody wants to log into a server that is effectively empty! People left because they didn't feel there were enough players on that they could interact with to justify continuing to play. Before that server completely died, however, I was told about /r/Civcraft in another PM message conversation! This was right when Civtek came out, and I had been spending lots of time playing Tekkit with my cousin IRL. 

I logged in, got some resources, and started reading the subreddit while I was AFKing something. I immediately realized the significance of what was happening on the main server. I had found it. A Minecraft server that had managed to find the balance between building and griefing. It even had a system to sink resources into protecting buildings! I was in love! I logged out of Civtek and into Civcraft faster than you could say ""cobblestone"". I wandered around for a while, acting as the classic newfriend. I eventually found someone within chatrange as I was breaking into an abandoned cobblestone castle. They told me how to get to them, and I soon found myself in the Jack's Hold. The rest is history!

I can go on if someone wants me to, but I won't needlessly extend my already daunting wall of text."

Chadder is also one of my first 10 in my town and he caught my eye because he was a mouse made out of CHEESE. I love puns! So, I bought him a cheese floor and cheese wall as well.

Lady_of_Shalott,tolkienfans,1390803625.0,"I feel like Gandalf had some knowledge of -- or strong guesses about -- what was to come.

JennyAnyDot,ForeverAlone,1390803635.0,I have no idea why you are being ignored.  Particularly if you are doing a good job at work.  Maybe because you always do great work and the others suck.

However first, pushing the ""well good thing I don't wanna date college boys,"" doesn't mean dick. You both are in your lower 20's. Unless you don't go out to bars, you're at the prime age when infidelity can occur. Just as him doing the same. I know you hate every person in your topic about this because we are lumping you into this, but it is the cold hard truth. Shit happens. Why a few of us are not pushing you to marry him just so you can be together. My example is merely there to give you an understanding that you two are honestly at an age where you do not know what is coming. And that putting your life on complete hold is something you should honestly be looking at and really making a sound choice with your mind and not your heart.  

And honestly if you are willing to put your life on hold and move to wherever he is, then you are codependent. Either way you'll end up saying ""I do"" and one promises you both a better future right away as opposed to waiting until he is out. Which if that is the plan, I do not know what to tell you. You are both pissing away BAH/BAS money while you are together. 

The people you are talking to on here are probably 7+ years your senior. They've seen the hardships. They've heard the arguments. They've dealt with the depression. They've had to be there for a friend in need. Don't mistake anyone's dark humor as a slam towards you. "

Suggestions to add little animations/sound effects/etc to every single champ arise at least once a week (like the suggestion to add voice clips every time you ban a champ, so they all whine/complain when you ban them, which would cost SO much money to rehire every voice actor for) and they're all really nice/cute suggestions but they're all worth weeks/thousands of dollars of extra work that they'd never ever happen in a million years."

I have my MinGW bin folders (""`mingw/bin`"" and ""`mingw/msys/1.0/bin`"") in my system path, so I can just navigate normally to a folder in CMD, and use the tools I need directly... But if I need to compile something or use bash features, I can just type ""`bash`"" without having to go through the annoying ""`/c/blah/blah/blah`"" stuff to get to the right folder.

And if I want to bring up a GUI, I can just ""`explorer .`"" and do things with Windows Explorer in the current folder. Especially if I feel like working with lots of files immediately after doing something in that folder with the command line. (Like what you can do with Nemo and Nautilus in Linux.)

Just note that there are a few small oddities with MinGW if you run a few of the programs it has included without bash.

lynn,AskReddit,1390804012.0,"When we both brought in money, we had a set amount each of us contributed to our joint account, from which came all household expenses. We made about the same amount of money, except when we didn't and I put a few hundred per month away so I could stay home with our daughter after she was born, so there wasn't any resentment.

Now he works and I'm the primary caregiver to our kids and household. We each get the same amount of spending money out of each of his paychecks, and the rest goes into our joint account from which all household expenses are paid. We each contribute roughly equally to the work the household requires, therefore we get the same amount of spending money.

We have discussed and agreed on exactly what comes out of joint and what doesn't. Kid expenses come out of joint, but eating out with kids but not spouse doesn't (we have a budget for eating out as a family). My husband saw a movie with our daughter and paid out of his own account; when I learned he'd done the same for when we all went to see it together, I told him he should have taken that out of joint as a family entertainment expense.

We budget our joint accounts using mint.com (which is free, and once you figure out how best to use it for your personal circumstances, it's a decent tool).

Communication is important in a relationship, especially about finances when you have joint bills, but IMO it's useful to, wherever possible, limit the number of things you *have* to discuss. Especially if you're planning on having kids, things can get busy and discussions can fall by the wayside, and before you know it there are a bunch of things you've been meaning to talk about but haven't gotten to, and you're both on different pages but you've been going along thinking everything's fine until suddenly it's not.

Then again, none of my husband's coworkers understand how we can do it like this. But I don't understand how anybody can have a joint account that both partners take spending money out of. It would encourage more spending, for us, I think. ""Well she got that spinning wheel and all that fiber a bit ago...I'm going to go ahead and buy those new computer components I've been wanting"" or ""well he bought that computer, so I can get this yarn."" And before we'd know it we'd be scrambling to pay for groceries, wondering where the money went. YMMV, of course."

QuestionEverythin,raisedbynarcissists,1390804155.0,"hmm, I feel as though it's not so much what he's requiring from me, but rather as though my issues are going to be a problem. 

Excuse the rambling, I didn't believe it'd all come pouring out.

tl;dr is that I've got alot of issues and feel as though I want to progress on them before getting more serious, and that he deserves more than what I can give right now. But I also don't believe in making choices for someone else based on my assumptions. Please me kind. I hate asking for help, so it's a big step for me.

- we haven't gotten that far, not so far as even an official date-

So really all he's seen is the outside. I'm self confident, cheerful always smiling, always helpful ect... The only real thing is my sarcastic humor and my intelligence. I kinda lie without realizing it too. I think the only part that might seem a bit off is the fact I refuse to tell anyone when my birthday is. All they know it's around march. 

I don't know. I have alot of issues surrounding the whole family thing, and just personal crap as well. It's all accumulated into a rather horrifying mess.

 I don't do the communication thing very well, or the being honest thing. Alot of the problems I feel would take a while to get me sharing and I'm quite terrible at explaining things (been told and admit to). When you're close to someone you get the whole your problems become my problems thing I guess, or at least you worry for them and since people worrying for me is...uncomfortable to deal with, I'd probably just avoid the subject. Something I'd feel would be considerably hypocritical as showing anger ect.. through body language and tone but not communicating it is something I find intolerable in other people. 

I'm also a bit of a runner (think toned down version of Denna from the King Killer Chronicles) there are times where I'm emotionally distant, and I often 'disappear' on the weekends if I'm free. I live in my head...

I get terrified if I feel as though I've done something wrong and no one will tell me what it is, though I often assume these situations. I apologize up to the point of annoyance if I'm not watching myself. Alot of the time I don't really know how to read emotions very well, or other times I read them with suprising accuracy but have no idea what to do about them. If I've hurt or offended anyone (usually because I don't know what is right to not say) I usually feel extremely guilty afterwards. I completely close down when someone is mad with me. I will respond but it's as if interacting with a robot. I understand this is frustrating for many. I often spiral into bouts of self hatred. 

I don't really do the touching thing, or I haven't for a long time. I'm not even going to get into the romantic stuff but I'm quite terrible at things like hugs or cuddling.  I don't know how and I always feel uncomfortable. 

I'm often distracted by other things, be them problems or not and don't really feel I can grant my full attention alot of the time. And lets not even get started on commitement. (as in not running in fear at the first problem) I went NC a long time ago, and have trouble facing and trying to fix the issue when it's personal relationships instead of running.

I don't know there's alot more. 

I'm definitely working on everything, I wouldn't ask for help if I weren't.  But I just don't see how this could work before I get farther on solving my issues. At the same time I don't think I'll ever solve them to my satisfaction. But I like him, obviously, and sometimes I think I'm being selfish by saddling him with someone like me when he could do so much better. I'm absolutely terrified if he actually asks me out/ wants this to go somewhere.

I'm aware I have a bit of a toxic thought process, but I'm not sure how to get around it or proceed, though your above advice did help. "

Don't let them put their anger (which should be directed towards the brother) onto you. You know who's at fault, and so do they. What the fuck were you supposed to do, anyway? I'm really sorry you had to go through this, it seems like your significant other is being really unfair. They're probably lashing out at one of the only people they can.

NeonGreenTV,TumblrInAction,1390804928.0,"I hate using this, but as a black person comparing this fat rights shit to racism is an insult. I'm also overweight. I can't change my skin color (not that I want to) and I was born black. If I buy a car that you know... a white racist police officer thinks I can't afford, I will probably get pulled over just for that fact, slim or fat.

When you're white fat ass drives around in that same car, that same white cop won't give one shit and stop you.

We can be driving in the same way, obeying all rules of the road. So don't give me that bullshit. 

Same with gay and trans people. Gay and trans people are born that way. These people are denied marriage, denied donating blood, and basically told their going to hell by religious bigots. Don't sit here and tell me fat people are systematically taking the same type of abuse that people of color or LGBT community is. And PoC and LGBT people who sit here and let these people include and compare their ""movement"" to these movements should look at what you're doing.

Again, I'm black and overweight. Though I didn't start gaining my weight until 12, so I didn't build my identity around being fat. People make jokes on my weight, but it was never anything so damn cruel that I thought I needed to rally a movement. Most of the jokes were endearing from friends and family because that's how they identified me. Do I cry about it? NO!

Was I ever denied anything because of my weight? No
I'm what they would probably call ""Small fat"" (that dumb 1984 newspeak sounding shit, and I hate 1984 references)

One day back in 2009, I went to sixflags and I got on a rollercoaster. I couldn't lower the bar to keep me in by myself, so the ride attendants had to come and push it down for me. The people behind me had a giggle, and I giggled with them. So did my cousin by me who was on the ride, and is a small girl. Was I hurt? No I was not. In fact I was just more ashamed of myself. I don't go around blaming society for me shoving for in my face.

But you know what, it's not even because I eat a lot, because I never get to a very ridiculous point of weight. I'm just lazy actually.

jpr64,travel,1390805088.0,"I don't know if there is anyone else here who has taught English in China, but I'm going to throw a pessimistic perspective on this:

&gt; China Is The New Land Of Opportunity

Well yes it is, in some regards though I would hardly say it is *new* anymore. The angle they pitch this seems more like a snake oil infomercial than anything. While there may *still* be opportunities, doing business in China is fraught with difficulties. You need a local business partner, good chance of getting ripped off, local laws are against you (you really need to base your legal agreements offshore, preferably in a common law country).

And all too often people dream big of doing business in China and have no idea what they're doing. Not enough market research is done and they try and sell to the Chinese as if they're Western consumers without really understanding the Chinese market.

&gt; Western Economies Are In A State Of Decline

Some truth to this. Adapt or die though. If you think you're still going to be manufacturing in a high-wage economy you're misguided. Unless you're highly qualified as an English teacher, a *great* salary is going to be difficult to find.

&gt; You Can Have A Much Higher Quality Of Life Than The West

This all depends on how you define quality of life. If eating out and clubbing every day is how you measure it, then probably. Constant difficulties, shitty smog, shitty hours, demanding parents, apartment in the middle of nowhere are a more likely outcome.

&gt; You Can Save A Lot Of Money

You could. Most don't. As point 3 puts it, you can have a great time pissing up - and most do. I didn't know many teachers who really saved any money, and the average salaries didn't help that. When the average salary is around USD $13,000 - $23,000 annually you're never going to save much. You'll come home just as poor most likely.

&gt; You Can Learn A New Language And Culture

You could. Odds are you won't. Expats tend to stick around together. Bit hard to get out and see the countryside when you're constantly drunk. Unless you're actually there to study Chinese you'll probably only pickup a few phrases/words to get you by.

&gt; You Will Make A Difference In The Lives Of Others

Every student in China is required to learn English. You're just another expat/laowai English teacher churning out the masses of students rote-learning English.

&gt; You Will Make Friends From All Over The World  

Bit of truth to this one, but they'll likely be from English speaking countries, getting hammered alongside you. Unless of course you're hanging out at hostel bars, that might open up a few doors.

Then there's the fact that the rest of the expats working professional jobs will see you as just another starry-eyed English teacher scraping the barrel drinking fake alcohol at student beer wells.

&gt; An Opportunity To Travel The World

Well with all that high-rolling eating out and clubbing, you probably won't have a lot of spare cash to travel to other places. You'll be looking at Chinese New Year (CNY) and National Holiday to travel which are notoriously busy for traveling anyway. You sure as hell don't want to be traveling within China on CNY. All of your other spare time will be private tutoring English to supplement your income.

&gt; Build Your Resume

Unless you have some other discernible skills appropriate to the positions you are applying for, teaching in China isn't going to make you a Chinese Business savant by any stretch of the imagination. Most likely by the time you get home you'll be a burned out husk of a person with little desire to be involved in China again.

&gt; You’re Going To Die

Well yes of course. Sucking down Beijing smog will bring this truth home much quicker. Yay for 25x WHO safe levels of PM2.5! That's of course if you don't get hit by a taxi.

Now of course I realise this is a shameful plug by an ESL company promising the world to naive youngsters fresh out of college with a degree. Teaching in China is different for everyone. Some genuinely love it - usually the ones trained as teachers in the first place. Others will hate it and drink themselves into a pit."

As someone mentioned above, I only have items that I use daily out (plates/glasses/bowls/utensils). I do have lower cabinets for pans and baking dishes. But because it's exposed I  have kicked the habit of acquiring random plastic cups, or mugs. If it's not white or glass, it's not going on my shelves. I also had to make a place for everything since it will be in view, so now my kitchen is super organized. And guests can grab or put items away easily because it's all in view. So I don't have to tell everyone where I keep the glasses all the time.

&gt;If this is the case, does this mean that men prefer women who play the ""ignore"" game?

The men you're talking about obviously did like that game. Do you know why? I'm going to guess that they were some very desirable men who pursued you. They asked you out, they initiated the chase. You let them chase you and they liked it.

They were probably the kind of guys who don't spend years of their life single without a date. They have options, and the easy options aren't exciting. So they want a challenge, they want you to be unavailable. They want to chase after you.

As is often espoused around here and other parts of the internet, those men probably only make up the ""top 10%"" of men. If you happen to meet a guy that you like through mutual friends and you pull that shit on him, chances are (like most of the replies here state) he'll assume you're not interested and move on.

Also, your caveat that he's fit, has good hygiene, and doesn't have a neckbeard kind of doesn't make sense because you said ""fedora persona"" (not just a guy in a fedora) and your description is the exact opposite of what I would describe the ""fedora persona"" as. 

But as for the behaviors you mentioned... I don't think someone is just ""old-fashioned"" if it is a contrived effort. If someone's family/town was really traditional and practiced some older customs and he learned it that way, I'd say he was just old-fashioned. Some guy who buys a fedora at Target and just randomly decides he should follow some archaic social rules is weird, lame, and awkward, he's not ""old-fashioned"" and quaint. 

""M'lady"" sounds weird. If men stood up when I entered the room I would feel super awkward because I'm not a judge or the pope or something. That's just a level of formality that is not applicable to anything in my life. Tipping a hat to me would just be incredibly cheesy and lame unless it was a joke. Kissing my hand could be ok if it was very infrequent and we were actually seriously dating, not a greeting from an acquaintance. It wouldn't, like, impress me or seem particularly cute to me, though. 

I also dislike the fedora itself unless it's for some sort of theme party or something. Dressing well means dressing appropriately for the setting. These hats are too formal for the settings guys wear them to and for the outfits they usually wear them with. It also looks costumey and gimmicky to wear something that is so emphatically not part of the fashion of our era. Humphrey Bogart looked classy in a hat like that. Some dude wearing a fedora with sneakers, cargo shorts, and a band tee does *not* look classy. Some guy trying to wear a fedora with his suit is also ruining his look because any occasion that is formal enough to wear a suit (again, barring something like theme parties) is an occasion where a goofy accessory is inappropriate.

trousercobra,AskReddit,1390806237.0,"I was supposed to spend a weekend with my then-good friend at her place, a few hours away. Took the weekend off work, was set to go, she texts me asking if I'd like to go to a rave in the States instead (we're close to the US border). I said no, because raving isn't my thing, we already had weekend plans that she was flaking on, and I don't even have my passport (never had any need for it yet so no real inclination to get it... I should though..). She then decided she'd rather do that and bailed on me.

So I called work, said I'd come in after all. Right as I would have been leaving for her place, she texts me telling me to head out now and come after all. I said nope, why the change in heart?

Turns out she'd tried to go, got to the border, US Border Patrol had done a quick search of her phone and laptop and found records of drug deals on it. They turned her around and told her she wasn't welcome back in the US.

Little things, all the time, that outrage me. But, if I speak up, about every single one, I'm a 'crazy femnazi', or a bitch, or a dirty liberal.  

Things like...

* asking a black customer in front of me if they have a food stamps card, but then not asking me

* a coworker telling me that Michelle Obama isn't pretty *because she's black.*

*  men and women both assume I'm stupid/a bimbo because I have blonde hair and look a certain way

* one of the other assistant managers that I work with told me 'she wasn't going to hire anymore black people, they're unreliable'. Um, are you fucking kidding me? Our staff is mostly white, and you know what? They're late. They're absent all the time. They trade shifts randomly. You're just not judging them by the same standard!

It's just so exhausting to correct people all the time.

021fluff5,cscareerquestions,1390806396.0,"Fellow  Washingtonian! I also did Running Start and loved it.

You have nothing to lose by majoring in business (or accounting, or econ, or anything else related to your chosen career field). 

CS, on the other hand... I'm not so sure. Once you get to the point where you can come up with an idea for a complex program and bring it to life, it's awesome. But it's also tedious as hell - imagine being up until 2am wondering why your homework assignment isn't working, and finding out that it was all because of a misplaced closing bracket.

It isn't hard to go through a few online  coding exercises - what is hard, and what will make or break your desire to be a competent CS student, is passion. You have to have *something* in you that's going to motivate you to make everything you write cleaner and faster, and you have to enjoy doing it. If you don't, you'll have a miserable time in college and a waste of a degree. 

My advice is to take CS and business courses and see which one you like more. Maybe you'll love CS and decide you want to be a software engineer, maybe you'll realize you hate it and major in something else. 

Have you talked to your family about this at all? Perhaps your dad (or his business buddies) can offer some insight."

Feroc,changemyview,1390806944.0,"&gt; IVF is insanely expensive. And why force nature's hand when there are simpler alternatives? And from what I understand, it's not a 100% guarantee it would even work on top of that.

I don't know about the US, but in Germany IVF costs about 2000€ ([German source](http://www.t-online.de/eltern/schwangerschaft/kinderwunsch/id_21617822/kuenstliche-befruchtung-soviel-kostet-der-kinderwunsch.html)) per try. Depending on the preconditions the insurance covers 50% to 100% of the costs. In some of the German ""states"" the state itself covers another 25% of your personal costs.

Now of course ""expensive"" is a very subjective thing, but even if you would have to pay the 2000€ all by yourself, I wouldn't call it ""insanely expensive"" if you have a normal job. 

So much about the costs part.

Personally I would choose IVF over adoption, because I want it to be my child. I want it to look like my wife and I. I don't want to be the first in my whole family who fails to procreate."

Dantilli,AskWomen,1390807333.0,"As a male, it's kinda hard to judge at first. After a couple of minutes of conversation you can usually gauge whether to be direct or not, but that takes experience and I still mess up.

The more confident women, like yourself, often prefer a direct approach. Either because they are used to dating or being hit on or have a good sense of who they are etc.

But if they are less confident and you try and be direct it can be disastrous. Either they get really embarrassed and try and escape (which can be helped by slowing down and being relaxed). Or they just assume that all you want is sex and refuse to have anything more to do with you.

I personally prefer dealing with confident people because it's so much simpler, much less awkwardness. But they aren't very common, at least not in the student area of a city like where I live. So I often have to ease myself into a date situation otherwise I'd never get a date at all. I don't LIKE doing it, but it's the only way I can actually get a date.

Since I used to be really anxious in social situations I feel the less confident should be given a chance. Just cos they're shy doesn't mean they don't want a relationship, just that they have a lot of anxiety around the idea.

Same for the women who assume I'm after sex, it's due to a bad experience, not because they don't want a relationship. They're actively LOOKING for people that want to ease into it rather than being direct.

Now I realise that maybe I should be focussing on the confident women because that's obviously the kind of person I prefer, on the surface at least. If I was certain that I did know what kind of person I am attracted to, I would probably be more selective. But at my current stage in life, I have no clue what I want tbh. I know what I want from a relationship, but have no idea as to the person to share it with. 

So I have to try and get past the initial barriers, get them to see who I am, that I'm not scary or just after sex, and start having fun.

Hope this helps, I know this is /r/AskWomen but I thought a male viewpoint was necessary. I know I stereotyped a lot in what I said and there are people in between and even completely different (and I didn't even start to go into situational differences), but that variation makes it even HARDER to know how to approach it. All I can do is make an educated guess based on a short conversation, but without experience, that guess is often wrong."

attakburr,tattoos,1390807340.0,"A former coworker of mine chose to have a tattoo done instead of a band. His wife wears a ring. They had a temporary ring for the ceremony that they borrowed from someone so the exchange of rings could still happen. He opted for a tattoo rather than a band because he could never find a band style he found comfortable. He's a pretty serious, religious guy... So while divorce does happen, I can see him and his wife doing everything they can to make it work. They also have already been together for 6 years (married last fall), so their marriage was by no means rushed.

His tattoo is pretty simple, 2 single band lines as an outline of the ring, and a circle in the center to mirror the ""stone"" on her ring. I think 2 simple bands, no circle would have looked better personally but to each their own. if you want it to be more personal, I've also seen the date tattooed on the inside of the finger.

But again as everyone else has pointed out, the aging and wear of the tattoo is something to keep in mind."

*There are two sisters. We'll call them Stacy and Jennifer. Their mom has just recently passed away, and they are at her funeral. While they are there, Stacy meets a guy. We'll call him Steve. She is immediately attracted to him, and he obviously is attracted to her too. They spend all day together, flirting and talking back and forth.

kiwirish,baseball,1390807369.0,"I know it's all subjective, my last sentence pretty much confirms that I know it's subjective, you can't objectively prove that a sport is better than another.

So, who cares about TV ratings? I like my regional sports, what I hate about the NBA is the bandwagon support that everyone hops on, that it is so popular that players aren't athletes anymore, they're celebrities. Look at ESPN, ""what did LeBron have for breakfast today?"", ""LeBron and Wade left the dressing rooms separately today, does this mean they're never ever ever getting back together?"". It's a fucking soap opera.

Wanna know why the NBA is so popular? Because it's cheap to play, basketball that is, you just need a ball and a hoop. Baseball you need a bat and a glove and room to hit a ball around, hockey you need hundreds of dollars of gear and ice, which doesn't exist is most places. The NBA is dominated by black athletes too, which makes it a much popular sport among minority demographics, particularly Asians as well with Linsanity and Yao making it huge in Asian regions. Basketball is also easy to follow and your top player is essentially your team. The NBA exceeds popularity of College Basketball because most people don't have a connection to any colleges unless they went there, whereas the NBA allows international fans to ride the bandwagons.

The NBA has not come close to recreating any drama that the NCAA tourney has had, because there's no surprises. We all knew Miami and San Antonio were making the Finals when the playoffs started. We all knew the previous year that it would be Miami and OKC, we all knew that 27 teams immediately had no shot at the title. NO ONE predicted Butler to get near the NCG, or VCU to make the Final Four, or FGCU to even win a game, or for Lehigh to beat Duke.

And the parity in the NHL is instantly obviously larger than in the NBA. Not a single team has been repeat champions this century. Teams like Anaheim, LA, Carolina, Tampa Bay and Dallas have won the fucking Stanley Cup. But the NHL does not have an ESPN contract, and most people have never skated, let alone played hockey, so most people don't give a damn.

The MLB is a broken system, we all know that, but the Rangers won the AL twice in a row with no payroll, the Rays won the World Series, the Yankees have only won twice in the century. Every sport has more parity than the NBA.

I like the NBA, but I can't get into it. I'm biased, I'll admit it, different strokes for different folks. But popularity does not make a sport better, in fact I'd argue that at a certain point, popularity just makes a sport worse and worse."

SublethalDose,socialskills,1390807454.0,"&gt; When I first met this girl and up until we made plans I was smooth as could be, no anxiety at all. I feel like that is the person I really am if I could strip away the mental issues I face.

&gt; The only thing I'm left unsure of is if I should bring up the fact that i do suffer from social anxiety, to maybe ease her worries about my sometimes cold/awkward behavior.

It may sound strange, but after some bad experiences I hold myself back from being too slick and polished.  I know I can do it for a little while, but then I get scared later, because I know she'll figure out eventually that that's not who I am.  The super-slick guy is a result of shutting down parts of myself that I can't keep shut down forever.  He's gotten me laid with a couple of girls who wouldn't have slept with me if I was authentically me, but that's a dead end, and I didn't really like those girls anyway.  The slick guy has also discredited me with girls who *would* have liked the authentic me, but who were not impressed with a guy who had to put on an act because he couldn't accept himself.  The slick guy is just the other side of the coin from the panicked, overwhelmed guy:  one is a good liar and the other is a bad liar.  The easiest way to tell her that you suffer from awkwardness and anxiety is to let her see a little bit of it from the very beginning.

Tall_LA_Bull,sex,1390807775.0,"A couple of points:

1) How ""okay"" this is depends completely on who the individual person is that you connect with, and what the three of you negotiate. It depends on how desperate they are, how well you treat them, what the specifics of their responsibilities are, and about a thousand other factors. You're talking about bringing someone into your home as a live in domestic servant, and also starting a sexual relationship with this person. You should be way less worried about the abstract morality of this situation, and a lot more worried about what kind of person you're hoping to find and the specifics of the life you'd like to achieve.

2) When you do find someone, you'll need to move quite slowly and really get to know her before you even consider this arrangement. If someone is willing to just move right in and agree to whatever terms you suggest, that should be a major red flag. That's either someone who is terribly desperate, or trying to rip you off.

3) There's no way to go about finding someone in a 'non-sketchy' way. You're hiring a prostitute/maid. It's a sketchy thing to do. Quit worrying about ""what site to use"". You're going to have to use them all to maybe, possibly, in time, find someone who is an actual candidate."

flyingcatpotato,AskWomen,1390808234.0,"Girl in IT here checking in.  I think the best way to pique interest is to explain how CS can help in real life situations- that the knowledge is useful even when working in a job that does not ask for IT.

One of my friends is a project manager for a certain type of in-house software.  He was with a client who needed a certain thing.  He wrote a quick bit of code to tide them over until they made the alterations necessary to the program with the real dev team. 

My ex works in senior management. One of his colleagues who worked in marketing got fired because she had no clue about how the computer systems in their company worked, and in senior strategy discussions she was completely out of her depth.  She doesn't even work in IT but her lack of basic CS knowledge cost her her job as a VP. They replaced her with someone who could demonstrate basic knowledge of networking and programming. 

I started my career as a paralegal and moved into IT later in life. I can appreciate how male-centric the field is. If i could tell kids one thing these days it is that in the future, just like kids in europe are expected to speak a couple of languages no matter what job they choose, in the future i think all workers will be expected to have a baseline level of computer literacy and even basic knowledge of programming in order to remain competitive and employable. I really think programming should be advertised as a life skill just like learning a foreign language.

Electric motors are actually superior to diesel or gasoline motors, their main drawback is the requirement for batteries or a generator. Limiting their ability to be used by road transport on large scale. But with a train, you have large amounts of space for both generator and motor.

One gender-neutral thing that might appeal to some students is just emphasizing the practical value of knowing this kind of thing when it comes to careers. You don't even have to be pushing them towards programming careers because a strong computer background would be beneficial to tons of fields.

I took a CS class in college to fulfill a requirement. I moderately liked it, but what I didn't like about it (and many other STEM classes I took in high school and college) was the tedious practices. In that class, it was very split between those who picked up on it pretty intuitively and those who really struggled. The professor needed to make sure everyone could get it so the lectures seemed *so* slow and we would practice such simple things over and over again. That's similar to what I hated in lots of math and science classes- they'd teach us a new thing, I'd understand it, and then I'd have to do 40 redundant problems to teach me how to do it.

As for regular airports, they have much much more security and unless a plane is in the hangar there is someone in it almost all the time.

justgivingsomeadvice,AskMen,1390808920.0,"You shouldn't be getting downvoted but I guess your experiences contradict the narrative here. Sorry about that.

Honestly, it depends largely on the type of guy you go for. Look at the top thread on this post, it's a bunch of programming references. You can make broad generalizations about /r/AskMen and while it won't be 100% accurate or precise, it'll give you a way to sort of qualify the information given here.

I would say that for many people (including myself), the ""chase"" is discouraging. There's no point wasting time over someone who may or may not be interested, especially if you think she won't be due to your past experiences (or lack thereof). I would also make a sweeping generalization that the kind of people who post &amp; upvote here on /r/AskMen are likely to be part of this group.

But for a lot of men, things are different. I don't have insight into this group of people as I'm not part of them, though I could make guesses about the kind of people they are (confident, hyper-masculine, extroverted).

What I can say is that if every guy you're with needs you to play these games, maybe you just attract (and are attracted to) these kinds of guys. But unless you plan on asking an introverted, nerdy redditor out, it'll just be something you have to get used to."

I seem to recall reading that it costs companies a large sum of money to train even qualified people when they are first hired. Look up the costs associated with turnover and hiring or if you know the HR person, ask them. Those savings can justify your higher pay. Additionally, they know you are loyal to the company because you can say you've been WAITING for this. Can they afford the risk of going with someone unknown and the time sink of hiring for the position?

banana-tree,Turkey,1390809833.0,"Skipping the personal insults, I'll just give you a few leads so that you don't embarrass yourself elsewhere. Things you claim didn't happen are all well-documented, not in fringe propaganda websites but in the archives. Perhaps not as much in English (haven't checked), but they should be accessible to you if you do know Turkish (I think you said you did?). You don't even have to deny they happened because you have the convenient defence of ""they had a reason"";

&gt;Menderes censored the press. The CHP did not.

I won't link you to every relevant law here, but [this is a decent narrative](http://www.enfal.de/sosyalbilimler/s/010.htm) of how press freedom changed over the years with specific reference to the laws concerning the press. I counted at least 30 papers that were shut down during Atatürk's time from various lists but more famous ones for you to look up are Tevhid-i Efkar and Tanin. The owners of the papers that were closed down were jailed or sent on exile as well. There was censorship to papers that weren't shut down too. There are notes recorded in archives that were sent to papers saying what to write and what not to write during İnönü's rule.

&gt;Menderes used violent thugs to attack minorities. The CHP did not.

Instead of violent thugs it was *lawful* robbery and labor camps (1942), and *lawful* resettlement (1934) basically, but sure. Those, and the pogrom in 1955 are just specific manifestations of a general mindset that both CHP and DP shared (remember Menderes himself was a member of the CHP too) -- it was a dominant psyche in the new nation state, not something DP invented.

&gt;Ataturk didn't jail and hang protestors,

That's a ridiculous claim, because İstiklal Mahkemeleri (those that were set up on and off after the republic was found all the way until 1939, not those during the war). The only line you can relatively sensibly defend is that the sentences were justified and targeted violent opposition only (that's not entirely true, but at least closer to truth than 'he didn't hang protestors'). I already gave you names of two poets that were jailed for their poems for you to look up (they're not exceptions, just famous cases), as well as papers that were shut down and their owners jailed and exiled. They were rather irregular courts that were open to abuse that way."

I play this game with my sister and it makes her sad that I time travel, but I always start my game one day after the last day I played, which sometimes means setting my game back by over a week, so that when I do have time to play I try to get a few days in one go.

I would really like it if there was an option to save it in stasis, so that it would pick up where I left off, and then to advance to different times, for example, if I set a meeting with an animal and I don't want to wait around or just turn it off and time travel, well, I could go to the save menu and click ""advance to next appointment"" or if there isn't an appointment ""advance to afternoon"" or ""advance to tomorrow"" or something like that.

I like it, although it's not a simple &amp; leisure game. But I enjoy it :)

A little review:
The item shop is open because you must pay debts. There's a periodical targets to collect some amount of money.
The variety of item which you can sell is depend on your merchant (buying/selling) level. The more higher you level, the more variety of items you can sell. The merchant level affects the shop decoration too. The higher the level, looks like more decorations can be done to the shop. At this time I wrote this, I just obtain level 2 and still can't decorate the shop yet.
You can obtain items stock for your shop from the market, the merchant guild and the dungeons.
The interesting part is the dungeons. It's not you who hack 'n slash monsters in the dungeons, but a hired adventurer. You control the adventurer in the dungeons. Hack 'n slash the monsters to raise the level of the adventurer, and pick some items (if dropped) from the defeated monsters. There's some chest in the dungeons too, just open it to pick some items.

I don't want to spoil the story to you. I can say the story is little funny :)

Just a reminder: Someday if you buy &amp; play this game, there's a solution on the Recettear subreddit if you have problem with key scrolling in the game.

All the time.

It depends on what - and who - I'm doing at the time. I live in a big city and I'm often in a hurry. At those times, I usually just flash a smile and keep walking. 

When I get cat-called on the street (often.), I usually completely ignore it. Once in a blue moon I'll flash a smile to that construction crew or whatever.

If I'm in a receptive mood/place/he's worth engaging with, I'll smile and say ""Thank you!"" Most of the time, guys just stand there with this funny look on their face after that. But, sometimes they try to strike up a conversation. I give them a minute or so, then overwhelmingly, I move on. Sometimes I'll take their card (and promptly lose it).

I'd say 99 out of 100 times, there's not immediate chemistry. When there is, I'll flirt back mercilessly.

If I'm committed to someone, I will still smile and be polite, but they'll find out about it in the first few seconds. I'm not interested in flirting with people that aren't my SO, when I have one. I don't get off on that."

BuildMyPaperHeart,Warframe,1390810924.0,"&gt; So as far as the fist melee weapons (Ankyros, Obex, Kogake, Furax), how do they compare?

Well, it should be noted that there are actually two influences behind the weapons, despite them potentially being listed simply as ""Fist"" weapons:

* Furax and Ankyros are the titular ""Fist"" weapons, worn as gauntlets on the hands for punchytime.
* Kogake and Obex, on the other hand, were conceptualized as ""kicking"" weapons, as they include both knuckle-dusters and toe-tips for four-limb action

The latter category has a little more reach, but not by much. The sliding attack does propel you forward with a handspring. The charge attack is a forward kick with knockdown properties, so it's a bit of fun.

Ground attacks are pretty good among all of them though.

Can't conclusively answer your second question. Guess there's only one way to find out!"

Same reversed to boyfriends that learned the consequences of messing with peoples hearts. 

This is one experience however, and there are many reasons to have that wish. Especially if you met someone who would have been perfect, had you not been in your crappy marriage at the time and didnt realize you and your spouse wouldnt work out.

Lady_of_Shalott,tolkienfans,1390810996.0,"I absolutely love Bilbo's quote, ""I don't know half of you half as well as I should like ..."" and the hobbits' reactions to it.

There's a few other turns of phrase I quite enjoy, but that one always sticks out to me and I'm glad it was in the movies.

I also really enjoy this line in SotP where Frodo is staring into the fire, thinking about the Cracks of Doom.

*"" 'No!' answered Frodo, coming back to himself out of darkness, and finding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out of the window he could see the sunlit garden.""*

I feel like this says quite a lot, in very few words. And I can relate to that sort of feeling, brooding about something and then coming out of it to realize that my surroundings are quite different in mood from the thoughts I'd been having a moment before. It's surprisingly vivid, coming from an author who I feel generally tends to ramble on and is far better at creating vast worlds than he is at getting deep into an individual character's head.

And lastly, 

*""When he returned Sam and Pippin had got a good fire going. 'Water!' shouted Pippin. 'Where's the water?'*

*'I don't keep water in my pockets,' said Frodo.""*

No matter how many times I read this series, this bit always makes me laugh.

And overall, reading these first chapters again is like reuniting with an old friend. I don't think I've read the books in about 7 or 8 years, though prior to that I think I read them all the way through ~3 or 4 times. It's wonderful to have a reason to come back to it."

grillkohle,askscience,1390811242.0,"Maybe I don't understand you correctly, but capturing, transferring and storing (!) said energy is rather complicated to be honest.  
The big problem here is that the sun is not reliable and you can't store energy in its electric form, you have to transform it into another form, which comes with losses.  
On the other hand, you do want electric energy available every single moment and the industry needs it as well.  
But, for obvious reasons (limited ressources etc) people are trying to make solar energy work, but it should be working together with other renewable sources such as wind and biogas. Diversification limits the risk and further research on effiency of wind and solar and storage might help us to go fully green at some point in the future, but right now, as the others said, costs are damn too high.   
Another dimension to the problem are local properties. While Mexico or Egypt might be able to go fully solar, Norway or Sweden don't see the sun much often (but they have other opportunities like water or wind).

Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1390811588.0,"I went to private school for most of high school because public school sucked at controlling the little miscreants who enjoyed bullying me because I was the awkward, odd kid who didn't pick up on social cues or respond in ways they thought were 'normal'.  Had my jacket slashed, stuff repeatedly stolen, accosted in the bathroom frequently, constantly made the butt of jokes, beaten up on the playground when I stepped between the bullies and the retarded kids they were picking on, and the fucking principal at the time was useless and refused to do anything about anything because everything was supposedly a matter of 'free expression'.  My grades were horrible because it's damn near impossible to learn anything in an environment where you are always having to watch your back and trying to not be noticed.  As for the private school, it was very strong on language and maths but kinda sucked in sciences because half the shit they taught in the sciences was explained as 'because God' due to it being a fairly religious school.  That said, it was strangely more accepting than the public school I'd been in previously.   I think it's because people who tend to be heavily religious also tend to be rather quirky so they accept the quirks of others more readily. The principal was a really nice, compassionate lady who was more down-to-earth, engaged with the student body and far more compassionate than the authority figures in other schools I'd been in. That's not to say I wasn't bullied there but it was a lot less severe and easier to deal with than in public school.  I graduated salutitorian."

My feelings regarding Macklemore are mixed. Sometimes it's to an extreme like fuck this dude but it's hard to put it all on him. There's some issues with the whole ""white savior"" shit. Sometimes I feel it's wrong to 'blame' him for being white and having those values but then others it's kind of clear that he knows he's not really trailblazing or anything but he's more than willing to take credit as if he is. He's not stupid or ignorant. He knows full well what he's doing and you have to respect his grind. I'm not sure if I've seen anyone else market themselves better in a little more than a year's time.

mb242630,AskReddit,1390811751.0,"some 6 years ago, i went for home early on the day a shooter killed 5 people at my university.

i remember it was a very cold day and i had just finished my noon class. being incredibly tired, i headed home to nap, knowing full well i might end up skipping my afternoon class. when i woke up from the nap, i heard what sounded like a snowblower outside. since it had snowed recently, i didn't think much of it. however, upon waking up, i felt a strange sensation like something was off. i checked CNN online but the only headline up had to do with the presidential election. i just dismissed that feeling as paranoia and prepared something to eat. at that moment, my SO turns on the TV and we see a helicopter shot of one of the building on campus with the title saying something about a shooting leaving multiple people injured and a few dead. i looked out the window and discovered that the sounds were not coming from a snowblower but from 7 or 8 helicopters all pointing towards campus. our cell phones were not able to place or take calls because the lines jammed, making me worry that my family might be thinking the worst. it took me another minute to realize that my class was in the building next to where the shooting took place. had i been there, i would have been contained in the classroom due to the lockdown order. This happened less than a year after virginia tech so the possibility of a mobile shooter was definitely in everyone's forefront. luckily, my lack of sleep overcame my need to go to class that day. as soon as i realized how close i came to being caught in the thick of it, i hugged my SO and tried my luck with the phone lines to check on my friends and classmates. luckily for them, none of them were near, but 5 students plus the gunman died."

I'm going to be following this same path soon, I have pressure headaches in my temple In want to trail botox on, But I have a constant pain behind my eyes and forehead I *know* is related to my air flow. when I breathe through my nose it feels like I am sucking through a lolly-pop stick. its awful. So far all my doctors have recommended is a decongestant or antihistamine. The other day I was so desperate for relief I stuck an icypole stick up my nose then rotated it. It was amazing, I could breathe, My headache was instantly relieved. But I can;t go sticking things up my nose any more because I'm not 3 years old and I don;t want to have to explain that at the ER as an adult."

Chocobean,Marriage,1390812389.0,"Hey, thanks for your response. I get it, i really do. My dad was, like many other immigrant breadwinners in our generation, an ""astronaut"": someone who is a half a world away from family because of work most of the year. It just didn't make any financial sense to quit/pack up and move with the family for most men in my dad's situation due to a million reasons. Many of my peer's dads never made the permanent move. Some took new families. Some came, felt miserable, then moved back to the money/calling. AT end end of the day it was never *really* money: it was rich+lonely or comfortable/discontent.  My father eventually chose family. It wasn't easy, he went from business owner to minimum wage labourer at a recycling depot, briefly. But he made what he felt was the more important call. I also know others who have made the move and felt unfulfilled, felt frustrated that his buddies in the ""old"" life are getting ahead, are living the life, have made the ""right"" choice etc. 

So, really, I have seen the whole spectrum. Results vary NOT due to circumstances or decision, but consistently play out thus: those who are content with their situation are happy, those who are not are unhappy. That is the same for people choosing marriage or choosing work. 

I feel for you. To most people to whom family isn't a source of strength, support, unconditional love and awesomeness, it is simply ludicrous to sacrifice a better lifestyle and a ""future"" for that kind of trivial nonsense. But, I can only imagine, for those who feel family is all, it is ludicrous to exchange that for anything at all in the world. You can talk to 100 people and I think probably 99 would feel the more ""justified"" and ""reasonable"" action is for your wife to leave her family and come out with you to your dream job and better life. 

&gt;We agreed beforehand that we would leave our families to pursue things elsewhere with the ultimate goal of ending up back where we started roughly 5 years down the line(with more money and experience). This was my initial compromise seeing how important family was to them in the beginning (this was even before we were married and almost a condition).

But. Where are you in your 5 year promise? She never signed up for leaving her family. She signed up for coming with you for 5 years, then going back. She was always going to choose family. If you went into marriage with that kind of understanding, you can't back out of it even if you made President of the United States without the marriage falling apart. You said you were newly married. So, tell her to wait the promised 5 years and you WILL go back, just not right now. If you can't imagine ever leaving again and fulfilling that part of the original deal, you could stall for time and hope for the best down the line. But unfortunately, it was a mistake to marry someone whose life goals contradicts yours so much.

In closing I will reiterate: those who find contentment within themselves will be happy where-ever they are and whatever in life happens. Those whose happiness only depends on circumstances around themselves will always be miserable or always on the brink of it, like a tiny boat tossed by ocean waves. This will go for both of you: find that inner anchor of happiness and true contentment, and either one ""giving up"" will still make the both of you happy. Without it, even if you stay together there will always be regret and bitterness for at least one of you. =(

mundabit,Fibromyalgia,1390812600.0,"I'm lucky that I learned about my sexual self before the fibro really set in, so I know how to reach orgasm. But the journey isn't nearly as fun as what it used to be and the destination is a lot less interesting. I had a lot of downstairs issues involving chemical burns, injury and infection, I developed VVS and had surgery to help, I used a numbing gel to rehabilitate myself and sitting down without a hemmaroid pillow was tough, so sex was out of the question. Combined with some birth control and my low-dose TCA, my libido was non existent. Not only was I asexual emotionally, but that carried over into a psycho-somatic numbness to pleasure in my groin. 

I came of my BC, I came off my TCA, I recovered from my surgery. and things are looking up. I can feel pleasure if the circumstances are right and I am *wanting* sex and finding people and things sexual again. Sex is still painful deep inside, I'm not sure if that's fibro or endo.

Vulvodynia is very closely linked to fibro in my personal opinion. They are both described as nerves sending the wrong signals. detecting pain when there is none, or not responding when they should. Medication for fibro can help with vulvul pain or vulvul numbness, but at the same time these medications can cause a loss in libidio or anorgasmia. 

With all that aside, you already have the most important part of sex down pat. Its about enjoying the time with your partner, feeling intimate and close. Focusing on that and letting yourself get lost in that moment, without trying to think of all the things that are *not* happening is the best way to enjoy sex. "

ScubaSteeeve,AskReddit,1390812653.0,"Over ten years ago, I was in a car accident that involved me breaking my jaw and also nearly severing my tongue. After the impact, I blacked out for a split second. It felt like I went unconscious, but I didn't. The next thing I know, my car's horn is going off, I'm bleeding profusely from my mouth, and I'm scrambling to get out of the car.

There was a mix of thoughts running around in my head. I was aware my tongue was barely hanging on, and I was bleeding profusely. I knew that I wasn't dying, but I was still panicking. I was pacing around, thick, chocolate-syrup-like blood drooling out of my mouth and all over my shirt. Among the thoughts I was having: ""oh god, my parents are going to kill me"" (I was 18 at the time); ""I'll never play trombone again"" (because it requires using your tongue, and at that time, I didn't realize how resilient the tongue is; it did fuck up my playing quite a bit for years afterward because I lost sensation, but I can still do it); ""what if I bleed to death,"" things like that.

I was lucky; there was an older Army guy jogging nearby who saw everything. I had already called 911 on my own, but he could tell I wasn't able to talk and took the phone from me. He could also tell I was panicking and yelled at me to sit down. It calmed me down enough that I stayed put, sitting on the street, until the ambulance arrived.

Mine wasn't life-threatening, though I suppose I could have bled to death. The car was totaled, however, despite the fact that I was only going about 15 mph when I lost control.

I still have the scar on my tongue, though it's been gradually getting smaller. It used to run the whole way across, but now it's shrunk to about half its size."

Whenever I plan on something, I usually never get it, it always comes unexpectedly"
noaddrag,SuicideWatch,1390813462.0,"I can relate with what's been going on. Just remember that there are people who love you, no matter how what you're going through.

Have a talk with your girlfriend. Arguments are never fun. But they are a part of relationships. If they're really petty and useless, the next time you start having an argument, see if it's one worth fighting about. What benefit do the both of you get from discussing the topic? If you both can't find a way to benefit, it's not worth the energy and emotional conflict of fighting. Just accept that you both have conflicting veiws, and try to think with a clear head rather than a combative one.

Your friend might be going through some hard times too. When was the last time you hung out with just him or with his friends? Try and set up a day of just hanging out with him, doing something both of you enjoy. If you really think something is wrong between both of you, you need to talk it out. ""But men are manly, and don't talk about their feelings to each other."" That's such a stupid B.S. societal rule. Just talk. You'll both feel a lot better.

The mom part seems to be the worst thing though. I know the feeling, that your mom could go at any minute. It's terrifying. So treat everyday you spend with her like it's her last day. Give her a huge hug when you first see each other, take a lot of pictures of whatever it is you do with her, and make sure to tell her you love her before you leave. If you can show optimism towards her, she might feed off of the positivity, which could help her recover faster. Stay strong, but know that it's ok to break down and tell somebody how much you'll miss her and how much she means to you.

Do you have a job? This could be a great solution to a few of your problems. The extra income could help pay for college. You'd be forced to get out and meet new people, so you could potentially make more friends. Heck, you could even find a job you'd be interested in that would make you want to change you major. 

At the very least, the people here on reddit love you, and almost every one of us wants you to know how important you are in this world. You seem like an amazing person who has just had a ton of crap dumped on them in a short span of time. You'll make it through. If I could, I'd give you a great big bear hug and tell you everything is going to be ok. Stay positive. You can make it. Us random strangers care for you, and even though it may not seem like it right now, so do your friends."

I just do my best not to be a dick about it, I politely tell the girl that I'm not looking for anything serious and why. Since I don't care that much about any of it, it doesn't bother me if she stops talking to me. I've gotten some really, negative reactions to that too. I guess it makes me an asshole.

My one piece of advice is to try and find some comfort outside of being wanted by men. You don't want to be dependent on a guy to validate you or make you feel okay with yourself. I don't really think that's a healthy habit to make, because in a sense you're creating an emotional crutch. I did that for awhile with women, just let them make me feel wanted and validated as a man, and as soon as there wasn't one, I felt like shit again. I had to go female-less for like two months and just really figure out who I was on my own. It really helped me."

I still think it was a bit of a panic purchase in the context of a long term plan. I imagine they were cool on the idea initially because they had different strategic plans on how they were going to spend and where they would probably strengthen. Then results were not up to expectations and look something that had been pushed on them. What were their two problems? One they weren't creating enough in the final third. Basically reliant on the ball getting to RvP or Rooney and them doing it on their own. Look at chance creation from open play. Dire.
Two more significantly, they had a summer with a clear, obvious problem and they failed to get their public target. As is clear by United's extensive use of intermediaries and hesitance to put a formal bid out, it was as much to save face and keep the image of pulling power as any conniving about Rooney. Mata means Moyes can bring in big players. That has to reassure a Vidal, Gundogan, etc. That money was being spent and big players bought into a project.


Ah re-edited my post but I still think this quote says something.

&gt;seven different agents approached United since August to say they could make it happen.

The player was brought to them and they wisely left the door open. If they did the deal, they still had the same core problems from the summer and now a semi-new player that is surplus to requirements. IMO a player that was too much of  a risk for them to gamble on given the constraints with Rooney's contract and a failure to really build momentum (Our run in Dec was after a pair of disappointing results; 2 losses I think to Everton and NewCastle?).

Emergency contraceptive has a high likelihood of causing spotting within a few hours of taking it. Progesterone levels are what the body uses to trigger a period, and progesterone is what almost all brands of EC contain, so basically the extra progesterone has just hit that mark that makes your body decide it's time to spot or bleed.

keep an eye on the amount of bleeding, spotting is fine, and so is a normal period, But if you start to bleed very heavily, more than you normally would during a period, contact a doctor, It's normally nothing serious, but you may need a dose of oestrogen to stop the bleeding so you can get on with life."

In the wider culture of most English-speaking nations, it's not only not expected that you fight, it's actually prohibited under penalty of law. If you had verbally provoked someone and then gone outside to fight them, you could have been exposed to serious possible consequences, both legal and just in terms of your physical safety.

In other words, you did the right thing by backing down. And you did the severely wrong thing by getting so drunk that you lost control of yourself and provoked someone to the point of trying to fight you. Don't do that again. If you can't stop from doing that, then you will know it's time to seriously examine your relationship with alcohol."

codayus,feedthebeast,1390814203.0,"I don't really see any of these (bar one) needing any clarification.

As for point one, let's go to the EULA:

&gt; Modifications to the Game (""Mods"") (including pre-run Mods and in-memory Mods) and plugins for the Game also belong to you and you can do whatever you want with them, as long as you don‘t sell them for money / try to make money from them.

That is clear as day, frankly.  The author **OWNS THE MOD**, eg, they have copyright over the mod.  Therefore, they can control distribution.  So yes, a modder can stop a user from uploading their mod to a distribution site they don't like; this can be trivially enforced via, among others things, DMCA takedown notices (and this has already been done more than once).

However adfly is clearly a no go; you can't make money from the mod.  If your adfly revenue is basically paying distribution costs you're probably fine; if you're turning a profit or paying your rent that way then you are in clear violation of the EULA.  Period.

As for point two:  That's not really covered by the EULA at the moment, but the one clear thing to come out of the Marc twitter debacle is that this is changing to *NOT* be allowed.

Four through six:  These are things which mod makers have **zero** legal rights to do.  Mojang can, effectively, strip rights from modmakers via the EULA (rather, force them to waive certain rights a a condition for using Minecraft to make mods), but they cannot grant them.  So there's no legal right, and—see point two—no non-legal ways to require this.  Again, that was the point of Marc's twitter mess, before it got sidetracked.

The only thing that's legitimately open for debate is whether mods can ""phone home"" to gather stats or check for updates.  Everything else is clearly settled; you own the mod, you can license it however you see fit, you can control distribution, but you cannot make money, you cannot include malicious code, and you cannot make the user do anything other than respect your copyright.

This isn't nearly as complicated as people are trying to make it seem.

Edit:  On reflection, the DRM issue isn't 100% clear.  If your DRM crashes the game, corrupts worlds, or does anything harmful (which, eg, all existing DRM type code has done), it's clearly forbidden.  I suppose polite DRM that just disabled its recipes if it detected a ""forbidden"" mod *might* be acceptable.  But I don't think Mojang would look on it favourably...

Tall_LA_Bull,AskMen,1390814909.0,"Don't do things based on what you or anyone else thinks men might like. Everything you do is going to deter some men and attract others. Literally anything. It's not a useful guide to how you should act.

Instead, do things based on your values, perceptions, interests, and the vision you have for who you want to be in the world. Then the people who are attracted to that vision will be drawn to you. So if you think it's a good idea to buy the second round because it seems equal, then do so. The traditional men who want to be providers will take it as a signal that you're not compatible (which it is), and the men who want a woman who pays her share will be into it. Wouldn't you rather have the latter man anyway?

tl;dr - Your friend is generalizing about men and it's dumb."

BlizzardofFlame,JRPG,1390815005.0,"Magical Starsign, The World Ends With You, Disgaea DS (just a port of the original PS2 one with some bonus stuff, still excellent though), Knights in the Knightmare (never actually played this one, but reviews were solid), Dragon Quest Monster series, Might and Magic Clash of Heroes, Legacy of Ys: Books I + II, The Dark Spire, and my personal favorite, Avalon Code. 

But seriously, Avalon Code and Magical Starsign are the shit. 

In Avalon Code you smack shit with a book and make other shit better to kill big shit and make your shit weapons able to kill bigger shit. There's also little sprites/fairies that help you. There's also a semi-romantic ""which girl will I woo"" kinda sub-plot as well. The story's nifty and its unlike anything I've seen in a while. And once again, the whole book-smacking mechanic is pretty sweet. You smack certain items or enemies and get attributes and can take their attributes or give them others. Of course, you can do the same for yourself and your weapons. It's pretty sweet. Story is a bit on the shorter side, but if you can get into the romantic sub plot, there's a good 4 or 5(?) girls to woo and then there's unleashing the different fairies to their full potential, which takes longer than I thought it would. 

Magical Starsign is a decently lengthed game with solid mechanics and some good wit. Both are damned wonderful. 

And of course, you sure as hell can't go wrong with Disgaea.

xamotorp,amiugly,1390815041.0,"I used to look fairly similar to you with the exception that I never wore beanies and I am hispanic. Black was my color and I wore it a lot, thinking that I looked better in it. I also had the same mentality where I thought I looked alright, and then there were times that I would look at myself and felt like I saw something more attractive in me that was being hidden.

Luckily (or unluckily?) for me, I had a girlfriend at the time so I didn't pay it much attention, and it didn't bother me much up until I saw one specific picture of myself and realized that I was fairly overweight.

Fast forward a few months and I was controlling what I ate (cutting out soda and fast-food almost completely), drinking a lot of water every day, cooking my own food, etc.

After losing about 40 lbs and a toxic relationship, I felt much better about myself but realized that i didn't look as good in my preferred wardrobe as much as I thought I did. I started wearing more form fitting clothes, which included some lighter colors (think blue [not dark blue], red, khaki shorts [not cargo]), groomed my facial hair, and got clean-cut haircuts. I started to actually feel great about myself without anyone having to compliment me. 

Now, I get many more suggestive looks from women and get told that I am a cute guy whose smile does wonders for himself.

Sorry, that dragged on long...

1)Your girlfriend is in the same situation you are, which realistically very possible. So say there's another guy, would you want to know? Or find out later?

2)You don't tell her, and you start seeing this chick, some Facebook pictures or whatever appear, and your ex is crushed, feels cheated and dejected.

3) You tell her, she is crushed but there's no surprises. However, this takes a lot of guts, and there's not a nice way to do it. So the chances of a civil breakup are slim to none.

4)You don't tell her and nothing happens with this chick, then you are kinda the only one that gets screwed. 

5) you tell her and nothing happens with this chick, and you get mega screwed. 

I would just sack up and tell her to be honest. Giving someone a nasty surprise isn't cool."

My secular friends thought I was making a huge mistake marrying at 22, but it worked out for us so the respectful part from friends was essential to our friendships' survival. =P ) She's confiding in you, which is awesome. 

ummmm...............if she's a logical creature (like myself) you could try to bring her here and have her ""debate"" us on why she thinks she can make an exception with her relationship vis a vis lust/Christianly behaviour. But it sounds like she's very juvenile and dependent upon rules to keep her ""good"" :\ Maybe bring her here anyway.

Final advice, if/when she regrets all this, or now, let her know that purity isn't virginity/your hymen: it's a lifelong pursuit of Holiness. It's kindness unto others with regards to one's sexual appeal (eg don't titillate and then deny, that's pretty douche). It's the continual, daily decision to forsake others for your chosen spouse. It's preserving not only your body, or lust, but your true heart's desires like the desire for appreciation, consideration and being set apart as special, for that chosen spouse. 

It's very human to enjoy sex (yay!) (all of it, not just penis vagina sex), but it's also a Christian calling to see if the enjoyment is within the right context. You're a good friend! Thank you so much for writing us.

bubbish,AskMen,1390815275.0,"Look man, once you develop feelings for someone, especially a girl who is already close, you can't just get over them or let them cool off. At least for me, that's how it is. And you owe it to yourself to take these feelings seriously. Frankly, I don't understand why it always seems to be expected that the guy controls his feelings and returns to being a friend. It's almost impossible to do, especially if those feelings are strong.

I've had a few female friends who have called me their rock of support as well. I mean, I never do anything more complicated than just listening to them but it's common that they come to depend on my support. It's easy to sort of fall in to that dynamic and forget about your own needs, it's a trap I've come across a few times now. Never forget to cater to the needs of your own feelings, though.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is, don't try to return to a friendship if it doesn't *feel right*. I realize the girl in your life must be suffering from your distance but I can't see any other way.

I'd like to point out, however, that from the way you write your encounters after your no contact-period there's a chance that the girl has found feelings for you but is afraid to show it. It's entirely possible that she has had time to think about things when you weren't contacting her, and has realized she also has feelings for you. Consider this possibility and if you decide to cut this girl out of your life, please make sure she hasn't changed her feelings about you first."

The Ambient Lighting powders are considered ""finishing powders,"" which basically means that you apply them last over everything else to give your skin the ""finish"" you desire. These particular powders are named after the kind of lighting that would give you that kind of finish.

While they are all called ""universal"" shades, there are some that will work better or worse for your undertone and skin type. Radiant is a bit bronzey, so it may not be the best choice for very pale and cool-toned skin. Ethereal, on the other hand, is probably the best suited for this kind of skin because it is pale and cool. Dim is slightly more matte than the rest of them, and can be used all over to help ""blur"" imperfections. Diffused might be better as a highlight on the tops of your cheeks, as it has a bit more shine. Mood, due to its pink hue, may not be ideal for those trying to conceal redness in their skin. "

The service industry needs workers. Being a waiter or waitress isn't a poor career choice, it's a necessary job for our current economy and often a job that is taken out of need rather than desire. The people in these jobs are often students (both of traditional university age and older students going back to school), single parents and people who need a more flexible schedule do to other commitments. They tend not to be life-long jobs or careers. 

We need to change the system so these people can have a stable and predictable income. But in the mean time we need to continue tipping so these people can still live on their money. "

Chocobean,Christianity,1390816110.0,"This reminds me of another church thing where they printed out ""Jesus Loves Pornstars!"" stickers and handed them out during porn conventions. 

It's so interesting to see [Jesus Loves Sinners] be stated in so many different ways. Because, of course He does! But it's also interesting that God's love comes with an asterisk: [Jesus Loves Sinners: but it hurts Him to see you like this]. 

Is it more accurate to say things that includes the other part always, like a TV/radio ad's disclaimers of ""some restrictions apply""? Or do we simply love and love and love until the person decides, y'know, maybe I'll not do this because _I_ have decided that it's not jiving with my beliefs anymore. 

That seems to be the attitude my church has always shown me for my (previous) ""chosen lifestyle/natural and life-long predisposition"" of hating children and wishing life would be extinguished and existence annihilated. My church didn't throw me out for my anti-humanism even though it flies completely in the face of the Bible and God's character. They didn't add ""but he hates your stuff"" after every time they say ""God loves you"". It was my cross to bear, and they felt like I could deal with it in my own time under my own conviction. The message on the pulpit was clear that He loves Life and He loves children. I had to decide what that means for me on my own. 

**tl;dr**: I'm not sure what the church should really do about all this hubbub, but precisely because of that, having a diversity in the church body might be a good thing."

THREE_CHAINZ,MakeupAddiction,1390816368.0,"There are a number of different options for highlighting and contouring, and you aren't restricted to items meant specifically for these purposes. Concealer or foundation 2-3 shades lighter &amp; darker work, but not for everyone. Contouring is meant to mimic a shadow, so it's generally better to use ashier colors (unless you have very warm undertones) and that's not something you can easily find in foundation or concealer. 

Warmed-toned faces can also use matte bronzers such as Too Faced's Chocolate or Milk Chocolate Soleil, or TheBalm's Bahama Mama. Be careful not to use something that's too orange. Both of the above definitely lean more brown than orange. 

Neutral or cooler-toned faces are better off with something like Nyx's blush in Taupe. Cream pigments, such as Illamasqua's Hollow or OCC's John Doe are also really great because I feel that creams look more natural and give you more control. 

Eyeshadow can be used in a pinch for either contour or highlight, but be careful to use a light hand as they are often more pigmented. 

Hope this helps! And there are plenty of contouring tutorials out there that list their products, so just familiarize yourself with what's being used and try to pick what would work best for you. 

edit: there are also a growing number of contouring kits being made! I think NYX has one, plus there's Senna, Kevyn Aucoin, Sleek, etc. Many of them are also called ""sculpting"" products so that's a good word to search for too! "
