carbidegriffen,AskMen,1389309317.0,"You've had it too easy, and it's fucked up your perceptions.  You have been connecting on a more superficial level.   
I don't think you know what you want in a woman.  
You have been making a connection based on looks and sex compatibility, which are important but they are only part of the equation.  
So long as you have the attitude ""I can always find a girl who is hotter"" you'll keep getting bored.  
You need to find a woman who tests you mentally and emotionally.  One who could care less what you look like.    
You've probably been blown off a few times and your response is, ""what a bitch""  Maybe they were a bitch, or maybe they just see through your shallowness.  

You need to find a girl where the question you ask yourself, could I find a ""better"" girl than this?  Not hotter.  

You should ask yourself, what is making this boring?  Why do I want to get with a different girl?  

Here is something that might changes your perspective a little bit:  
I've been with my wife for about 10 years, I did my share of being a man-whore before that.  When I met her she didn't put up with my shit right from the start, she made me a better man.  Now, I see girls and I think, ""damn, she's hot, hotter than my wife.  I could totally take her to bed and rock her world.""  But then I realize, I share something with my wife that I couldn't with someone else.  For me there is no better woman.  She's not the hottest (a 7 after having 3 kids), but she turns me on.  We each play to the other's weaknesses, one is good with finance, one is good in a crisis, we make a team.  
No relationship is perfect, it's all about both of us aiming for the moon and making it to the clouds.  Life in the clouds is pretty good, it takes work.

TL:DR, You are dating the wrong women, or you can't see a women for who she really is.  You need to go deeper."

I don't think that is necessarily the case, but it could be seen as such. I've seen people get married in white wedding gowns as well as other stuff. I can tell you this based on experience: The wedding almost always sucks when they don't stick to the traditional stuff (unless its already an off the wall wedding at a beach or something etc). The white dress just looks timeless. The others *always* look like they are trying too hard. 

That is my experience. I am not criticizing anybody. I think people should get married however they want. BUT: To me, the white dress makes it all the more memorable."

I lost it, I blacked out from rage and my friends told me what happened after. Four friends tried pulling me off him while I punched him. The part I found funny is that once they got me off him and he was backing away, he was standing over part of a see-saw.

The_Ugliest_Man_Ever,NoFap,1389309359.0,"Thank you, yes! I was given that same advice by a married accountability partner of mine. She knows I've struggled with porn and that I get help for it. She doesn't know the details as far as the material I used, or the extent that I used it.

As I mentioned, some of that stuff got pretty extreme, like ""police raid"" extreme, and I don't want to burden her with that. My buddy said he made that mistake and then had to spend weeks convincing his wife that she was enough. The poor girl went to pieces and asked him to do stuff from porn that he really didn't want to do to her. It really became an issue for a while. They've since resolved it, but it still lingers every now and then.

I know that it's hard for women to grasp that just because something can stimulate, it doesn't mean we want to engage in it. Just like she told me hers about some trauma she had with a guy, but she spared me the details of that and I don't need or want to know more.

Bottom line, I'm damaged goods and so is she. We're both content to leave it there, abandon the past and walk forward to face what ever comes at us together. But a very good point. Full disclosure doesn't necessarily mean detailed disclosure."

KeanuReavers,nhl,1389309393.0,"&gt;Maybe when he first entered the league

This is exactly the reason.

He was pretty much bred to be a great player. Mario Lemieux and Gary Bettman paved the way for him to be a star, and a lot of fans really bought into him being ""the next great one"" or however they were selling it. So it really made a bad first impression on most hockey fans when this entitled newcomer who everyone was talking about would dive and complain as much as he did, earning him the nickname ""Crybaby Crosby"". Sure he could score like Ovechkin and pass like Gretzky, but his snotty attitude on top of his padded upbringing overshadowed his numbers for anyone who wasn't a Pens fan.

Now he's definitely toughened up, I haven't seen him dive all season, and he's leading the league in points. He has a Stanley Cup, a gold medal, and even a few trophies. He's one of the most impressive players of our day - but it's that bad first impression he made which is going to stick with people for a long, long time."

kellykebab,funny,1389309439.0,"No, actually that's a really great point. I think that reordering system is awful and fell victim to it myself whenever I did end up overdrawing. That's a big reason why I switched banks and until I start making ""real"" money, will not use Bank of America, Chase, etc.

However, I believe even the sleaziest banks offer some kind of overdraft protection. And after the first few instances, it's not all that difficult to realize how they reorder payments. The trick is to make sure you always have enough money for any upcoming (and likely to ""pend"") transactions at all times, *always*.

There's also the option of switching to a different bank or credit union with a different charge denial/overdraft policy. They do exist.

And not to be overly nit-picky, but choosing the library over ordering ebooks is a great way to minimize expenses. I've been perusing a wealth of rare materials via the interlibrary loan system, which sends me cool books from libraries across the country. And many popular items are now available as borrow-able ebooks anyway.

I do agree that the payment reordering system of most banks is predatory and disgusting. I simply disagree that it's impossible to avoid.

onionmancer,oakland,1389309454.0,"It's not really clear what your argument is, and there is no argument made in your link that I could see, just some useful statistics.

Is the argument that other places have high crime rates even though they have better officer:population ratios and so that must mean that officer:population ratio doesn't have an effect on the crime rate?

Each city's crime problems are different, and so are the city and region's endogenous and exogenous economic and cultural factors which help determine crime rate and the effectiveness of policing.  It could well be the case (and probably is) that those cities would experience worse crime rates if they had worse officer ratios.

In any event, it's not very helpful to compare different cities' crime rates and officer ratios over one year, because of all the differences between cities.  If there's some clear trend or regression line you can map, you can make some pretty strong inferences from that, but they're still just inferences and predictions.

A better (or at least something else you should be doing at the same time) way to figure out the relationship between officer ratios and crime rates is to look at the same city over time while population and officer ratios fluctuate.

There are of course a number of shortcomings with that methodology - e.g.: 
* how officers are deployed and trained varies over time, which means a year-on-year comparison is not perfect;

*crime reporting rates may fluctuate over time, which means the crime rate may reflect a different %age of actual crimes committed over time (like if a demoralized population stops reporting minor property crimes because they know nothing would be done, reported crime rates may drop even though crime is worsening, or if a police force is doing an effective job and more crimes are reported as a result, then the crime rate may worsen even though the police are improving public safety); 

*officer quality and morale changes over time means that adding an officer will mean different things in different places at different times.  For example, I expect Milwaukee can attract better officers than an Oakland or a Detroit can, and even Oakland can probably attract higher-quality officers than Stockton, based just on geography."

Wore minimalist shoes (Vibram Fivefingers), and did the marathon with no specific training for it at all (a friend of mine was already registered and sustained a minor injury in training so I decided to run it with her for moral support).

If you don't already wear minimalist shoes, that's a good change to make right away, once you've adjusted you'll reduce your risk of injury from training for it or running it. Other than that, if your legs are in shape you'll be able to do it."

soccerdadak,Divorce,1389309760.0,"My daughter was 5 when my ex got a restraining order against me and I was kicked out of the house (weirdly coincidental, I was 5 when my dad walked out on my mom).  My daughter didn't understand and kept asking my mother ""why doesn't daddy want to come see me?"".

6 years on and my daughter and I have a fantastic relationship (1.5 year legal battle to get split custody, but I got it).

Here is what I have to say from my experience:

1 - It sucks, but be calm and patient.  It'll all work out eventually

2 - Our kids are far more resilient than we give them credit for.  Given time, all of this will be a memory that barely affects them.

3 - Don't forget to take care of yourself.  Deal with this on your own, but deal with it so your kids don't have to.  Find good friends and let them get you drunk.  Get a new hobby.  Meet new people.  Go to counseling.  Whatever you need to do.  If you're happy, your kids will be happy/happier.

4 - Don't spoil your kids.  Do things with them, don't just buy them stuff.  I say this as a father who completely spoils his daughter, but I waited until after the divorce was done, custody was settled, and a routine was established.  I didn't want my daughter to grow up associating ""dad"" with ""gift"".

5 - Now, more than ever, be very clear in any rules you have with your kids.  Their lives have just been upset, so any dodgy rules will confuse them more, which will cause problems.  Be calm, matter-of-fact about any rules up front, but be patient if they don't get them right away.

finally, 6 - use kid gloves with dealing with conflict, but don't let them get away with crap just because you dont' want to hurt their feelings.  They need stability now more than ever.  Give it to them."

pikabye,r4r,1389309891.0,"FWIW, you can go via Seattle for $600ish on some days. Flying from LAX to Seattle isn't too bad. The key, though, is that it'd have to be on separate tickets, which would leave you SOL if you missed a connection.

e.g. if you only wanted to go for 4 days (for some reason):
Feb 23: LAX-SMF-SEA AS 4046/373, arriving in SEA at 12:30PM
Feb 23: SEA-KEF FI 680, departing at 3:30PM
Feb 27: KEF-SEA FI 681, arriving at 4:40PM
Feb 27: SEA-LAX 472

Which comes to $578 (SEA-KEF-SEA) + $222 (LAX-SEA-LAX) = $800. Definitely not as bad.

You could also do it on the same days with a single ticket for $882, since Icelandair has a ticketing agreement with Alaska Airlines, and you'd be better off if you missed a flight. It'd be LAX-SEA-KEF-SEA-LAX (AS459/FI680/FI681/AS476). The fun part is that you could probably use that ticket to spend some time in Seattle (&lt;24h per direction) without breaking the fare.

Food for thought, I guess.

EDIT: If anyone's genuinely interested, give this fare construction to a travel agent: LAX AS X/SEA FI REK Q132.00 302.50SBR3SPEC FI X/SEA Q132.00 AS LAX 212.50UBR3SPEC NUC 779.00 END ROE 1.00 XT 5.50YC 7.00XY 5.00XA 35.00US 7.50AY 23.00IS 6.00ZU 13.50XF LAX4.50 SEA4.50 SEA4.50

Looking at that fare construction, actually, you could probably bring it down by another $90-100 if you pick the right departure date. Actually, that fare looks really reasonable...

Final edit: Yup, you can bring it down to $792 USD and book it directly on icelandair.com. February 20-27 (other days work) LAX-SEA-KEF-SEA-LAX (AS477/FI680/FI681/AS464 - depart SEA @ 6AM, enjoy a 6h layover in SEA, arrive in Iceland at 6:45AM on the 21st. Leave at 4:55PM on the 27th, return to LAX at 8:58PM on the 27th). If you want to book through a travel agent, here's the fare construction: 
LAX AS X/SEA FI REK Q132.00 212.50UBR3SPEC FI X/SEA Q132.00 AS LAX 212.50UBR3SPEC NUC 689.00 END ROE 1.00 XT 5.50YC 7.00XY 5.00XA 35.00US 7.50AY 23.00IS 6.00ZU 13.50XF LAX4.50 SEA4.50 SEA4.50

JoshuaIan,Games,1389310320.0,"Of course TVs ""count"", it means the exact same thing for consoles that it does for PCs - if you have one, you don't need to buy a monitor. 

Let's think this through. How much is the cost for either if you have no sort of display unit? PC wins there, no contest. Monitors are a lot cheaper than TVs. If you have a TV previously, all you need to do is buy a console or a PC, which is approximately the same amount of money.

Of course, that completely ignores the difference in power between PCs and consoles, and the vastly cheaper PC game cost. Sure, consoles have sales, or if you subscribe once in a while they'll throw you a triple A title from 2 years ago for free, but it just doesn't compare to Steam sales, GoG sales, GMG sales, etc.

Really, this myth that PC gaming is more expensive than consoles using any metric is just hilarious.

Price-adjusted for today, my gaming PC would run maybe $400 or so and it smokes xbox one or ps4's power. Having the freedom to spend more to get more power if you want it does not mean that you need to spend a crazy amount of money to run modern games at better settings than nextgen consoles, it just means that you can make your games look omfg amazing if you have the coin and desire to."

potato1,todayilearned,1389310391.0,"I agree with you up until your last sentence. Because it's far more difficult for motorcycles to maintain stability under heavy braking, and human operators are unlikely to apply an optimal ratio of brake pressure to their front and rear wheels, motorcycles often have longer stopping distances than cars in practice. A trained professional operator or extremely skilled and experienced rider (which you may well be) *can* stop a motorcycle with optimal tires in a shorter distance than an average car. 

But most motorcyclists are not up to that standard, and under very heavy braking are prone to do things like lie the bike down due to excessive rear brake pressure and instability, or in the worst case, apply too much front brake pressure and go over the handlebars. Note also that this applies only to bikes without ABS, which if present dramatically simplifies demand placed on rider skill.

However, this doesn't really matter, since what'll really get you when it comes to being rear-ended is inattention of other drivers causing them to not notice a motorcycle at all while they plow into you."

internethertspert,motorcycles,1389310437.0,"Zero came to my work for a motorcycle demo day we had last year.  They had 3 or 4 different models, the S being one of them.  I was able to ride the S and the FX.  Overall they're pretty cool bikes, but I would recommend waiting a few generations before purchasing.  They have great torque at 20mph +, off the line they are smooth in acceleration and really pick up speed past 20mph.  Once you're cruising and you let off the throttle you don't get the same engine compression breaking (obviously) from the bike, and it actually makes a big difference in your riding style.  I didn't realize how much you can depend on it, or at least be used to how it naturally slows you down without using the breaks.

My favorite of the two was the FX. [Shity Picture, sorry](http://imgur.com/aGMgbsj)  This bike looks like a dirtbike, but it was faster than the S by a lot!  

Big thing i didn't like about the bikes, was at speeds of 50mph + the steering is supppper wobbly.  Since the bike has no weight behind it, taking your hands off the handlebars is not very safe.  I feel like they should increase the rake of the forks (bring the front wheel out a bit) to increase the wheel base also.  The bikes get approximately 120 miles around the city and ~80 miles on the hwy from what the Zero guy told me. So it definitely limits you from any long distance trips.

Internexus,AskMen,1389310549.0,"These are just my thoughts after reading your story so take them with a grain of salt.  I feel that she did in fact mean everything she initially said to you and that was her letting the truth out.  However, I don't think that she expected you to take it the way you did and become proactive with preparing yourself for the dating world.  In my opinion she felt that you were likely weak in this aspect and she would be the one out having relationships and instead you took life by the reigns and flipped her mental world upside down.

You were the one that had to initiate sex before and you cut down your efforts because you no longer cared..  So your new persona that is attracting the attention of the other ladies and your greater chances of finding other women to date especially younger than your wife has made her question her own decisions.  She therefore reversed what she said, and is sexing you up as much as possible to try and convince you to stay in the marriage.  To me she's being manipulative and dishonest, once again this is only my opinion but I would follow through with the path that you've laid out for yourself.  When you've built a relationship like that with someone and they cut you down to the core there is nothing left, there is no emotion, no love, no passion, no faith, and no TRUST.  The relationship is nothing but a shell at that point, and you staying in it is just a band-aid to a future disaster.  I hope you keep us updated along the way and wish you luck with whichever path you choose. "

3. his comment claims that he has ""no idea what goes on in those games."" Without further clarification, it appears that he's making a statement without any research or past knowledge, which doesn't fit well with this sub's usual posts and comments.

In other words, he generalizes MOBAs and most popular games as being low-skill repetitive games and he doesn't go in-depth. Such things are usually more associated with /r/gaming than /r/truegaming."

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389310560.0,"Any man should be able to have a ten minute long conversation about *something* of general interest without provoking a fight or making someone else uncomfortable.  Light conversation isn't *bullshit*, it's just normal conversation but a little more purposeful and little less casual.  The idea of light conversation is *keeping it light*, not letting it veer off into arguments and hostility.  

I actually figured out my own secret to engaging in light conversation because of a joke Jerry Seinfeld made about pretending he's a talk show host when talking to people.  Have you ever noticed how talk show hosts talk to their guests?  They ask questions that don't have yes or no answers and *listen* to the response.  Then rather than *correcting* or *one-upping* their guest, they respond with a follow up question, a compliment or a joke that demonstrates understanding or sympathy with the guest.

You can learn from the mistakes hosts make too.  Like watch David Letterman turn off his guests and make them hostile with belittling jokes that point out their flaws and insecurities.  Watch Conan O'Brien come off as desperate to be liked by carrying self-deprecating jokes too far.  Watch Jimmy Fallon come off like a goofy manchild by fawning over every stupid thing his guest says.

You can also learn a lot about people very quickly using this method of engaging in light conversation.  There are certain clues you can watch for that give you real insight into their personality.  If you ask questions that invite complex answers, and they give you dull and insipid answers*, you know either they are dull and insipid or they are completely uninterested in you; either way you move on.  If they don't try to engage you back, if they don't have questions of their own and only seem to be interested in your interest in them, then they're selfish and you move on. 

If you have problems with that, you might want to look into how confrontational you are and how rigid you're being about accepting other people's right to have opinions.  Or, alternately, you might want to consider if you're being a downer and oversharing your troubles.  Also, don't assume just because you try to engage women in conversation and it goes nowhere, is frustrating or falls flat that it's *your* fault.  A lot of women are really just dull, self-involved and boring and they're shit at conversation too.  Guys blame themselves for being socially awkward a little too quickly.

I remember years ago I went on a date with this gal I met off dating site.  She was a bona fide scientist.  She was very attractive for a nerd, so I liked her right away, and she worked in *bat* research which is just a fascinating topic.  I mean bats!  Bats are awesome!  Top 10 of coolest animals for sure. We should have been able to have an awesome conversation about that, because she was knowledgeable and I was curious.  

But instead, we talked about the mysterious stranger who had slashed her tire the weekend before.  The entire date, all she wanted to talk about was this incident, and how angry she was about it, and so on.  Nothing would change her off the topic, and the topic just made her angry and upset.  So the date went *horribly*.  Was it my fault?  No, she came to that date with a shitty attitude and ruined it for herself.

*But don't confuse shy/bashful for dull/insipid.

I guess I'll make another post about trying to get a low bar squat.

We_Are_Legion,worldnews,1389310761.0,"&gt; Would these happen to be ""regimes"" like that of Hosni Mubarak? Or maybe the ""regime"" of Bashar al-Assad?

Honestly, there are so many examples. But in particular, I was kind of thinking about the oppressive and illegitimate sheikdoms of Arab islamists like Saudi. 

Can you even **imagine** a Taliban or Al-Qaeda without a Saudi bankrolled ideology and their fucked up moral teachings and example? Can you imagine Pakistan having an Islamist problem without these fucks pushing Wahabism everywhere they can?

&gt;they actually did bring stability to the region. 

And poverty. And brutal oppression. In fact, they really just delayed and exacerbated the eventual instability, and stalled proper development. Please don't pretend US involvement here was for anything other than US interests.

Its interesting to note, *one* of the main grievances of ordinary people in Pakistan against the US is for giving lump sums of billions to military dictators that people hated, and prolonging their rule(turns out people remember who was best friends with the last dictator, who knew?). Even as these dictators promised power to religious nut cases(one of the few groups willing to sell out constitutional ideals like democracy) in exchange for support, sold influence to foreign financial backers like Saudi Arabia, re diverted money from development to shoring up the regime's military, created secret police, curbed freedom, arrested journalists and judges, literally executed an elected head of state on trumped up charges, had other opposition leaders assassinated or disappeared(not proven, though for all intents and purposes, many ordinary Pakistanis do believe it to be so), imposed ""states of emergency"" to curtail opposition, and allowed corruption to entrench and run rampant (sometimes simply as a measure to gain stability). One of the fuckers literally overhauled the schooling system to teach mostly Islam for a time instead of real, comprehensive education.

But its all ok, right? These dictators also cooperated nicely with the US in Afghanistan and all sorts of other issues. ""Suppressing"" the ""fringe elements"", amirite? Meanwhile, these same rogue military elements later used these militants to create a Pakistan-friendly albeit religiously theocratic Afghanistan. And we all how this turned out. These ruthlessly encouraged rogue military establishment may not have its top man as President right now, but it still sways elections, has the internet censored in its favour, and harboured a certain Al-Qaeda leader for its own reasons. 

Look, I'm not heaping this out of hate, nor do I particularly enjoy long heated internet debates. I don't hate the US, but I abhor its government's past foreign policy decisions, which have often been extraordinarily short-sighted and irresponsible, if not outright uncaring. Don't blindly proceed to dismissal of ""generic rhetoric"" simply because you don't like it, in favour of simplistic explanations of ""enemies"", ""stability"" and ""lesser evils"". There is no good guy between these two countries, on the issue of terrorism. Its a common enemy. With common responsibility.

DragonFireKai,magicTCG,1389310793.0,"Alright, so, to run a heroic voltron, you need four things: heroic creatures, heroic enablers, a means of reach, and a means of defending your creatures. Each color has different means to accomplish those goals. But ultimately, heroic decks are aggro, they seek to aggressively advance their board state, as opposed to trying to hang on for a big flashy win condition. Mono white is the fastest, but hybrid decks can create a more stable mid range state.

Generally, you'll be running an X/W  scheme. White has the most effective creatures, the best boosting enchantment in ethereal armor, and reach/defense hybrid cards in gods willing and brave the elements. Hopeful eidolon also synergizes well with heroic and ethereal armor, if it's drawn early, you can play it as a backup voltron candidate, or as a heroic trigger later in the game, and also allows you a measure of board presence if removal hits. 

We'll start with blue, because that was the color you were interested in. Battlewise hoplite is a very strong creature that I would suggest making the primary focus of the deck. The other blue heroic creatures are kind of janky. Artisan of forms is only good if the other player has a decent creature, and the fortune hunter is good for card advantage, but it costs three mana, and doesn't scale up like the hoplites, and isn't protected by brave the elements. I wouldn't discount the fortune hunter because of the way blue's common triggers hit two targets, but if you use it, you're commuting to a mid range kill target. You might simply consider using the bident of thassa to achieve a similar effect.

Blue has some very strong triggers. Hidden strings being the cream of the crop. Hits two targets, and recurs for as long as you can keep your voltron alive and hitting them. Triton tactics also hits two targets, and only costs one mana. Blue also has the best reach spell in aqueous form, one mana, unblockable, combine with hidden strings and things will spiral out of control quickly.

Blue's defensive contributions are different. Mizzium skin acts as a one mana defense, but lacks the utility of gods willing in this context, one the other hand, it works against same color threats without losing the enchants, and also defends against two card kill attempts that use alternating colors, which you might see from esper control. A very underrated card is swan song. One mana, and it stops any targeted kill spells and even stops mass removal, except for that Damn verdict. The drawback is unimportant, because you've got the biggest creature on the board, and it's probably unblockable. To get around the verdict, you might consider using indestructibility, seeing as the slower game plan would allow for four drops.

Green's heroic creatures are all terrible in constructed.  So you'll be relying on white creatures. But with good mana acceleration and strong pump, this would be where I recommend using the fabled hero as your primary threat.

Alpha authority works as a permanent defense against spot removal, and a means of reach. Trollhide gives pump and a way around supreme verdict, and giant growth gives cheap pump to push for the kill.

The use of mana dorks gives you an out against devour flesh and away.

Black's heroic creatures are not win conditions, they're supplemental cards. Black has some pump, but the real strength is in being able to use thoughtseize and sin collector to figure out the opponent's strat, and get rid of it before it can begin. 

Black's got some decent pump in dark favor, deviant glee, and scourgemark. dying wish can make someone think twice about killing off your voltron, and boon of erebos can give you a cheap regeneration to survive most kill effects, but ultimately, it's difficult to build a heroic B/W deck that works as well as the current B/W decks. So I'd advise against going here.

Red is different. While red does have access to powerful triggers, such as madcap skills, titans strength, and dragon mantle, red's heroic creatures, more specifically the akroan crusader and anax and cymede, lend themselves to a more of a goblin style of offense, with a heroic twist. This is further reinforced by red's general lack of defensive options. Use the akroan crusader to build a horde of tokens, and the phalanx leader to buff them all, and anax and cymede to buff them all further and give them trample. 

Emphasis the two target triggers, coordinated assault, martial glory, and dauntless onslaught, to proc two heroic triggers with one spell, and either add to your army, or buff them as needed. This, in its own way, devalues spot removal, because if they take out your crusader a couple turns down the road, you still have the tokens it created, if they take out the phalanx leader, you still have the counters on the other creatures. 

Add in some akroan hoplites and battalion creatures like tajic, blade of the legion and frontline medic, and some universal buffs like the spear of heliod, path of bravery, porphoros, and legions initiative, and the 1/1 with haste that a crusader drops becomes quite dangerous in its own right. Sheer numbers becomes your means of reach.

Defensively, boros charm will protect against the verdict, allowing you to save your gods willings for non kill removal.

The other color combos don't really have much to offer. When you leave white, you lose a lot of key cards, and if you went to three colors, the deck becomes much slower.

If you lose McCoy you're likely to replace him with someone like DeMarco Murray, Chris Johnson or LeVeon Bell.  It actually is a big step down.  For reference, McCoy scored ~100 points more than Bell this season, a BIGGER difference than that between Morris and Lamar Miller, for example.

circledot,Teachers,1389310838.0,"&gt;How to reprimand them when they're out of line (I'm allowed to do this within reason), so very basic corrections such as ""Are you lying to me?"" ""You need to share."" type things.

Be careful with the words that you use. ""Are you lying to me?"" is an emotionally loaded question and will probably evoke an emotional response. You need to keep your conversations with the kids as calm, logical, and positive as you can.

For example, say you have a kid who just blatantly lied to your face. I might say something like, ""I saw you [blank], but then when I asked you about it you told me [blank]. Why is that? I need you to tell the truth."" Positive language (tell the truth) instead of negative language (don't lie) goes a long way.

Directives to the kids like ""you need to share"" could be better phrased as something like, ""Other people need to use the markers too. You can use [number] at a time, but please make sure you are leaving enough for everyone to use. Thank you.""

When a student does something that is inappropriate, you may want to first ask what is going on that made that happen. Homelessness is a stressful situation and most behavior problems will probably be caused by issues relating to that. Maybe the student is hungry or didn't sleep well, or something is going on with the rest of his/her family that is causing him/her to act out. You could say something like, ""I noticed that you had your head down/didn't want to sit in your seat/couldn't stay focused today. What's going on?"" Then give the kid a chance to explain and offer some sort of solution that meets their needs but still keeps them on track. ""After this next problem, we can take a few laps around the room."" ""You can sit by your friend, but I have to see that you are working."" ""For this writing activity you can write about whatever you would like.""

I have found two problems. The first is it needs to have sugar in it or it tastes horrible. This makes it difficult to bottle condition for carbonation without it exploding. I make small batchs that will be drunk in a week and put it in plastic bottles. Then I just squeeze them and if the pressure feels too high, I burp them. The other problem is if you ferment for a high abv, the ginger notes disappear and it tastes like cheap champagne mixed with hot pepper.  

My recipe is as follows and dose not follow tradition practices for brewing beer and is honestly kinda half assed compared to how I normally brew. I will overhaul the procedures when I get a keg system. 


5gal Ginger beer  
* 1361g of pealed fresh ginger  
* 2000g Brown sugar  
* 2 cups fresh squeezed lime juice.  

Run the ginger though a food possessor with a slicer attachment. Toss the ginger in a pot with a gallon or two of water and bring to a boil. Shut off heat leave for an hour. Strain ginger tea into brew pot. Add brown sugar and water to 5 gallons, boil 5 minutes. Add lime juice and make sure all brown sugar is dissolved. Cool and put in carboy, pitch yeast (I use whatever random ale yeast is in the fridge or Safale US-5). Airlock. Ferment a few days and taste. If it's not good, keep tasting every day until it's good. When it all set, bottle into *plastic* screw top bottles (soda bottles). Screw on tops. Check bottles every day until they pressurize. Then refrigerate to slow down fermentation. Drink within a month or two, best within a couple weeks. Continue to check bottle pressure, belching as needed. You may need to add a table spoon of brown sugar to your glass if it gets a little too dry.

As a primarily support player, it also feels my MMR isn't where it should be, as **most** games usually rely on a strong carry to win the game. Arguably, some good support can win the early-mid game, but if the game drags on, it really is the carry/carries that have to take over and win.

Logic and emotions are not some kind of rigid binary where you're either logical or emotional. Your emotions inform your logic and your logic informs your emotions.

FactualPedanticReply,AdviceAnimals,1389311114.0,"Actually, western American usage of ""dude"" largely comes from the pioneer days - the mid- to late-1800's. In that time, there were ranches where wealthy and fashionable east coast city slickers could come out to the edgy, wild west and have a ""real cowboy experience."" In that time ""dude"" was used in much the same way as ""dandy"" (the noun), and these institutions were called ""Dude Ranches."" It carried a judgmental, negative connotation to call someone a ""dude,"" but the fact that it referred to men was more about the relative social and geographical freedom of men to have such adventures at the time. The characteristic element of being a ""dude"" wasn't your gender - it was your economic and geographical background.

The insulting characteristic of the term diluted over time, and it came to be a generic term for a person. It'd be pretty easy to argue that dude's lineage is about as male-specific as ""person,"" actually. In a cultural context where a generic person is thought of as having the characteristic ""male,"" even ""this person came by to buy a saddle"" carries a connotation of maleness. I'd argue that it's that dynamic that shaped gendered surfer and stoner usage in the 60's and 70's, rather than it being something inherent in the etymology of the word itself."

Keep working out.  Get strong, be confident.  Take risks.  Make mistakes.  Laugh at yourself.  Don't bury your face in a phone.  Experience everything you can.  Try new foods.  Try new hobbies.  Travel as much as you can, whether by foot or bus or airline.  Just get out there and experience it.  Don't trade your life for love.  Don't have kids until you're mentally ready.  Find a job doing what you love.  Failing that, find a job that makes you piles of money so you can do the stuff you love.

Check out [Tim Ferriss](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/) and [Ramit Sethi](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/).  Both are guys who have really put themselves out there.  Tim to do things he was curious about, and Ramit in the financial/social world.  Their stuff has massively improved my own life."

You could probably also do this with cans of tuna that are packed in water. Go for Skipjack (or Light) tuna because it has less mercury. Regardless, I like the taste of Skipjack better than Albacore."

Aside from that, the convulsions during a seizure, can be violent so holding them down may be dangerous.

Also, you can drive them here year round, while up north you'd have a hard time using them in the snow.

It took some doing, but I can stop them all on a dead run after something and bring them back to me. I incorporated hand signals so in noisy environments they can see my command and know what to do.

Omega037,changemyview,1389311707.0,"&gt; Do you seriously believe that throughout the entire animal kingdom, the only species able to feel pain is humans?

No, I believe that *all* life, plant or animal, experience negative stimuli.

&gt; Animals have a central nervous system unlike plants so therefore they can feel pain and suffering and plants cannot.

Many animals don't have a central nervous system.  The fact that some do have one just makes them more similar to humans (and thus higher value comparatively).

That said, plants obviously *do* feel a form of pain and suffering, as evidenced by how they react to negative stimuli.  It is hypocritical for you to say that their differences make their pain somehow ""not legitimate"" yet get upset when I say that the pain that animals feel is different and ""not legitimate."" 

&gt; Also, other mammals respond to pain in the same way humans do. If you harm any mammal (including a human) then they would react in the same way. If you harm a plant then they do not react the same at all.

They may respond in similar ways, they may not.  I have already established that the more similar they are, the more I value them.  You are the one that seems to draw arbitrary cutoff points.

&gt; This is a very selfish view. There are people who care about those two people that died just like you care about the person that you know. Those people would now be emotionally suffering for your benefit.

&gt; This is the same as when an animal dies. That animal likely has others who care about them that are emotionally suffering because of their death.

I want you to really think about this.  Please be honest.  If you had a choice to either save two random strangers or you mother (or other loved one), you would really save the two random strangers?  Really?

I didn't say I wanted them to die at all, but if I had to make the choice, I value some people more than others.

&gt; Humans also have neurotransmitters like acetylcholine, it does not mean we cannot feel pain.

Yes, but my point was the value of life (or preventing pain) is *not* about biology, but about sociology.  Human pain matters because of *who* they are, not because of how their body works.

&gt; Relating back to OP's original argument, it is not at all controversial to say animals feel pain. It is actually widely accepted by most people that animals can feel pain. On the other hand, the argument that fetuses can feel pain has been debated by people for centuries.

You were the one who brought up pain, not me.  I simply said that I determine the value of a life based on its closeness to me.  That has nothing to do with how much pain it can feel.  

Hell, there are medical conditions that can cause a person to be incapable of feeling pain, yet that condition does not decrease the value of their life to me as it would to you obviously."

Giving up on them would reinforce the mindset that people can't handle them. I would look seriously at what you can do to improve your class dynamic by the end of the year. You can be a source of positivity and stability for the kids, but you have to work on your classroom management first.

My students ate me alive my first year of teaching. I was 23 and ""nice"". I would go home and cry sometimes because I was just so stressed out. I went on anti-anxiety meds and antidepressants. Because I'm crazy, I kept showing up day after day. I kept smiling at them in the hallways. I kept pushing them to work and succeed. I built up a core of students who loved and fiercely defended me.  I learned to see the good in a group of kids who were hard to like sometimes. Those students are now in college or have jobs. I keep in touch with a good number of them. I'm not going to say that what I put myself through was worth it, but it got better and I am now genuinely convinced that teachers do make a difference.

Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.
When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.

All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.
They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.

You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.

Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389311791.0,"Please, for the love of god, ignore all these dumbasses who are telling you to lawyer up and divorce her.  What is going on here is very, very simple and easy to explain.  Basically, you had the best possible of all possible responses to your wife's announcement, and we're lucky to -- entirely by accident -- be given a) the time to save your marriage and b) took *exactly* the right steps to save your marriage.

Here's what happened:  You and your wife became parents, and you stopped being lovers.  You stopped being man and woman, and became father and mother.  Your relationship to each other became defined by your children, and you fell into a rut.  This happens to almost all couples.

Your response to the announcement of the divorce plan was to what?  Prepare to find a new woman.  You started making yourself attractive to women again.  Finding your inner masculinity and bringing it back out.  The **you** that you put up on a shelf when your first baby came was now back in play.

And who is that guy?  Who is that guy you brought back down from the shelf, dusted off and put back on?  *That's the guy your wife fell in love with and married.*

She didn't fall in love with the dutiful husband and providing father.  She *stayed* with that guy because that guy was best for the kids.  But it was the other guy, the guy you stopped being when you were ""Dad,"" that she fell in love with.  Over 24 years, she forgot that guy was in there somewhere.  Can you blame her?  A lot of shit has happened in your lives since then.

Tell your wife you don't want a divorce.  Be firm.  Tell her that you still love her and she still loves you, and that you don't want a divorce at all.  Tell her you want to *marry her again*.  Have a second wedding.  celebrate that a new chapter is opening in your life, where you both get to reconnect with the person you both were before you became mom and dad.  This is your second honeymoon, the one all parents get when the children are grown and leave the home, the one that doesn't ever have to end.

Take your wife on a cruise.  Go visit the Caribbean.  See Paris.  Do romantic things.  Fall in love again, and this time let it be about *you*, and not about *kids*.  You've done your duty, its time to celebrate the rest of your life."

You can either get really bitter at this and think ""I'm the only rational one"", you can get downright sexist with it ""Women are *so* crazy"". Or you can be an adult and accept that it is because everyone is just a little off that the world is such an exciting place to be and it's these little quirks, oddments, bizarre fancies that make people enjoyable to be around.

This also disparages people that, you know, actually have a real mental illness.

Rather than saying 'not crazy' I would much prefer 'a type of crazy that would be complimentary and beneficial to my type of insanity.'

I think a lot of guys use 'crazy' as a pejorative against women. I'm a guy and when I have a shitty day I snap at people that don't deserve it. Then I feel bad about it and apologize later. Heightened emotions or misplaced aggression are in no way localized to one gender/sex."

If you're really passionate about finance, I say go for it assuming you're not going into a position heavy on the sell-side where it's hard to jump start your career (i.e. WM, Financial advising/services) to repay your loans.

What is it about the industry that makes you passionate? The financial modeling? The data analysis? The money? The prestige?

Man up and quit, or shut the fuck up and smoke your cigarettes.

I don't think that I am better or worse than anyone.  I gave my two cents as someone who has been there and done that.  I have tried every method you can think of to quit smoking.

It's a matter of plain fact that men *do* suffer inequalities, too. It's massively sexist to say they should just ""man up"" and wait until everything is fixed for women first.

I mean, seriously, would you support a racial equality movement that kicked out anyone who cared about racism against Asians, or Mexicans? Think about how long it would take if we had to wait until racism against blacks was completely erased before moving on (and how stupid it would seem to try to ""erase racism"" by focusing on one race)."

The problem I have with reading the SMART data is knowing what it actually means. How would I tell what SMART data is ""okay"" and what is a potential problem? I have the failed (possibly) disk in a USB caddy and am scanning it now with Seatools. Nothing has shown up yet, but then the USB caddy kind of ""anonymises"" the drive so perhaps the Seatools disk checker is not recognising the drive as a Seagate and running all the Seagate tests that it is designed to do.

The Linux test tools I have are much the same: they run surface scans, or give me raw SMART data. The surface scans come out okay, and the raw SMART data I don't understand."

pomjuice,spacex,1389312154.0,"Are we talking about service ceiling, or maximum operating altitude?

Service ceilings are typically much lower, and have a lot of factors involved. I'll admit my terminology was a bit weird too, so I'll clean it up here. Service Ceiling is a density altitude where a plane must be able to achieve a specific rate of climb (typically 100ft/min) while in a clean configuration with maximum thrust from engines. Sometimes the service ceiling is lower than this theoretical limit for other reasons - such as maintaining a specific cabin pressure.

Now, Maximum Operating Altitude is typically always higher than service ceiling, and this is the absolute maximum a winged aircraft can fly. MOA is achieved when maximum thrust available from the power plant equals the minimum thrust required to overcome drag while maintaining level flight. That does depend on the powerplant, you're right. I was referring to service ceiling earlier, but maximum altitude is directly effected by thrust available.

Also consider, at very high altitudes, there is less air resistance, because there is less air. At what point is there not enough air for your electric engine to push anything? Unless you're thinking of an electric rocket... whatever that might look like.

There are some people whose anti-American bias is so strong it drives them to make ridiculous arguments about American supremacy and beligerance, and one of the more common ones is that Americans are supposedly assholes for calling ourselves Americans, because everyone from the continent of ""America"" is an American -- so Canadians are Americans and Mexicans are Americans, and Americans are supposed to call themselves USians.  Which is a stupid, ugly looking nonsense word that no one will ever adopt -- and they know it, and they make the argument just because they know Americans will react hostility to the claim that we would call ourselves something as dumb as USians if we weren't so close-minded/nationalistic/assholes.

That shit is really tiresome, and I thought that's what you were getting at, so I may have been more hostile that you deserved.  Apologies."

It has a VERY noticeable smell, but if you smoke outside it doesnt cling to your clothes like cigarettes do. just blow the smoke away from you. 

Expect to cough, if youve never smoked anything before. It can be considered pretty harsh to smoke sometimes but thats how you know you are inhaling it right. 

Will this be joints or from a pipe or bong? 

anyway Just go with the flow, its a new experience but dont overdo it. Smoke 1 joint and wait a half hour, or take a few tokes and wait. patience is key. People say they dont get high the first time but i went to outer space my first time. It was pretty crazy, my hearing became buzzed and i felt like gravity got turned up by a factor of 10 and i couldnt peel myself off the ground. it was pretty funny! If your experience is very intense like this i dont expect you will run into the munchies, but you may get Cotton mouth, so get a good drink to sip on. Try an iced tea!

The next morning may leave you a bit buzzed, especially if you smoke it late at night. i had to drive to school with the music off the next day because it was too much.

JordanLeDoux,Ask_Politics,1389312791.0,"As a ""progressive libertarian"" myself, the underpinning philosophical difference between libertarianism and libertarian socialism comes from differing ideas of what equal protection and equal rights actually mean.

Libertarianism is (mostly) about the protection of individual rights equally between all parties in all circumstances, given the circumstances of our current economic trade.

Libertarian socialism  is about the protection of individual rights equally between all parties that attempts to ensure that certain types of capital (means of production) are also equal between parties. The reason for this, within the philosophy, is that means of production is a capital that confers additional rights and can create some outcomes which can be viewed as net negative through the exercise of private property rights (which exist in both philosophies). Within libertarian socialism, the view is that means of production are a capital that by definition cannot belong to a single party while still maintaining a consistent application of individual rights. 

What this means in practice is not that the government has the right of ownership to means of production, but that each person affected by the circumstance of such capital has equal right to that capital."

Your partner, the person you sleep next to, the person you walk through life together...should not be adversarial.

I think scientists need to start engaging in education and combating misinformation with the kind of passion that is normally reserved for battles regarding evolution or climate change or vaccinations.

Inter alia it notes that at the time of writing (April 2012) only 0.25% of encrypted sites supported TLS 1.2.

Now the practicalities: this might be useable on a site like Amazon to place an order to an existing address. The bank web site that I use is rather different. A couple of examples: firstly, it has a single ""thread"" of user interaction (not thread in the CPU sense). Unlike Amazon, I can't do transactions in a second window - it's specifically designed so that this won't work. Secondly, all new payees have to authorised using a smartcard and PINpad. Apart from this, BEAST is quiet difficult to execute as it requires that you know that I'm going to use the bank at least ten minutes in advance.

As it happens, I use a different web browser for the bank in any case, and always shut it down after use, which is another defence against BEAST. But in practice, no, I'm not going to pick a bank solely on the basis of its crypto."

tomfishtheGR8,AskReddit,1389313635.0,"Bank of America. Here's why:

Day 1: Received email of suspicious activity on debit card. Checked statement. Confirmed that purchases were not mine. Phoned customer service, described the situation, filed claim for fraud, told them to cancel the card. 

Day 2: Went into my bank, described the situation (I'd just canceled my card, so couldn't use ATM) and deposited $200 bucks into the account to cover overdraft fee, accumulated by fraudulent spender (I didn't want to have to deal with trying to get that back through a claim, and you have, I believe, a three day window to make a deposit before you actually get the overdraft charge. This was a dumb idea, but BoA is horrible to try and deal with).

Day 4: Receive and email that my account has been frozen. Call customer service and find that the fraudulent party somehow managed to deposit a stolen check into an ATM using the card number (I had the physical card this whole time) that I had requested be canceled, and then withdrew against the balance ($1000 from stolen check, my additional $200, plus overdraft fees).

Long story short, BoA accuses ME of fraud. I have to spend the next FOUR MONTHS trying to stop them from permanently messing with my credit history. Meanwhile, they refuse to refund my $200, as well as the original money that was wiped out during the first spree of fraud. Doesn't matter that I filed a claim within MINUTES of receiving the notification email they sent me, to which I have the claim number, telling them explicitly to cancel the card. I ended up walking away with a clean credit history, and a portion of the money I'd lost, but they still charged me for both rounds of overdraft fees. The entire process was excruciating, as anytime I'd call customer service they'd bounce me back and forth between their ""claims"" and ""fraud"" departments, and I'd have to explain this whole long story to each person along the way, who would ultimately ask me tons of condescending questions and basically accuse me of trying to scam them. 

I just...I...I mean...who alerts a bank to fraudulent activity on their account, three days before trying to deposit a stolen check? I TOLD THEM TO CANCEL THE CARD!!!!! ARRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!! 

TL;DR BoA can suck my fucking dick.

It's not used to having non-pill hormone levels. Same with dietary changes, stress, health changes (make sure that peeing isn't a UTI--does it hurt anywhere? Does it smell off?). 

You can take a test now and again in a few days if you have no period. It should help with peace of mind.

For future reference: with most birth control pills, if you exceed 7 days off (the normal placebo/period week) you should wait at least 7 days after beginning a new pack to depend on them for protection against pregnancy. It's also recommended that you begin that new pack on the first day of your next cycle as opposed to mid-cycle, as you may have ovulated if it's been more than a week or two, and it can increase the risk of annoying side effects like spotting to start the pill mid-cycle.

I think your approach to finding women depends on whether this is a kink you just want to try sometimes or whether this is the only way you can really get off. Either way, there are women out there for you, but the latter means you have to seek out women who are predominately dominant. The former means you just have to find women who are a mix of dom and sub. 

For me, 75% of me is strongly submissive, but 25% of me wants to dominate. And that dominant streak is something I've acquired mostly from watching porn. Women are capable of developing a taste for it -- not just a tolerance for it, but a real desire for it. So don't be too shy about your kinks. Drop a few hints, gauge how open minded they are. I think a lot of women mistakenly think crossdressing or pegging are a sign that you're gay, so you'll have to find a way to educate them on that. The way I understand crossdressing, it's sort of a fascination with femininity taken to the extreme. As for me, I'm so fascinated by masculinity, I could totally get off on pretending to be a guy. So I feel like I understand the desire. 

Speaking for myself personally, the crossdressing/femdom/pegging type stuff I'm attracted to involves really built, masculine guys. It's the juxtaposition that I find hot--the idea of dominating a guy who also dominates me. If your goal is to get with women who, like me, are a mix of sub/dom, I suggest hitting the gym and dressing masculine. Get with a girl who watches porn and is open minded about sex. Not to stereotype, but shy girls tend to be kinkier. Once you've had some 'normal' sex, suggest prostate play and see how she reacts. If all goes well, eventually have a conversation with her about kinks...and be prepared to indulge whatever her fantasies are, too. ;-) Or if you wanna just cut the bs, I think you can also just talk about kinks before you start having sex. It depends on what you want out of the relationship.

I couldn't be with a guy who wanted to be submissive all or most of the time. If you're exclusively turned on by crossdressing/pegging, then you really need to find a woman who wants that all the time and isn't going to wish that you would also dominate her. That seems harder and I think you would have to go through groups on the internet or local kink get-togethers or stuff like that. But I'm sure there are women out there who are into it. 

Basically, you have two options. 1. Look for a generally kinky girl who wants to do this for you because seeing you super turned on will turn her on. Or 2. Go for a girl who wants to do it because she specifically has this kink, too. If you want the first option, you have more women to choose from, you go about dating and go from there. If you want the second option, you have fewer women to choose from and most likely you go about hooking up and trying to find a sexually compatible woman who you can eventually make into a girlfriend.

I've been getting used to people rewriting history and saying that Martinez has Everton doing better than Moyes ever did.

Would you agree that the biggest change that has won over supporters is the fact that Martinez plays attractive football? Your position in the table hasn't changed from last year IIRC. Just the huge transition we're going through, and Spurs to a lesser extent means that some big teams have fallen behind.

I keep seeing people giving him credit for the form of players like Coleman, Baines and Barkley. But I think a lot of credit has to go to Moyes in those cases. He brought those players in and nurtured them to their potential.

His youth development is one of the things that excites me most about him.

I would also argue that Martinez was rather fortunate to get his trump card, Lukaku, because of of his falling out with Mourinho. Whereas a lot of outlets say ""Well Moyes would never have the ambition to sign him"". Even though players like Lukaku and Deulofeu were brought in through a bit of luck (albeit well taken advantage of), and Martinez's Spanish connection which obviously Moyes didn't have.

Don't get me wrong though, I love Martinez and think he'll be great for you guys, but recently there have been articles that act like he's turned Everton around from being a backward but solid team, which frankly I'd say is revisionist shite."

* Just because an employer wants you to be loyal, does not mean that they will be loyal to you.

* People lie, a lot.

* If you wondering about the motivations of others you are detecting deception, more often than not.

* Never date a woman who cares about the looks of men or about what you drive.

* Never fall in love with a woman you can't have a conversation with.

* If you are trying to make a decision about someone's character, watch them make a tough decision.

* Never, ever lend friends money. Give it or don't give it.

* You are responsible for your own success and career. No one will make it for you. Anyone who wants you to believe differently is exploiting you for professional gain.

* Anyone who is advocating a belief system to you is not your friend.

* Most people who are trying to convince you of something are many times trying to convince themselves.

* People are weak but always plan to be strong. Always assume this first.

* Do whatever you can to keep money from being a major influence in your life. It will control you. It allows others to control you.

* Don't worry about the meaning of life. The meaning is to wonder, live and find something you love more than yourself.

* Chasing sex is a waste of time. It is wayyyy overrated. Don't let your hormones rule you.

* If you don't know who you are, you are attracted to the wrong mate.

* How you handle risk and pressure will determine most of your life's outcomes and rewards.

* Dreams are made in bold strokes but lost in shades.

* Never expect a conservative thinker will ever invest money in anything for any reason.

* Everyone has a wound they are trying to heal whether they realize it or not.

* Nothing anyone else ever does is about you. It is about them and only them, no matter what they say do.

esiedub,AskWomen,1389314534.0,"I think the idea that older-ish people (not born in the 80's or 90's) can get away with casual sexism is bullshit.    

I really like this quote regarding it: ""the worst kind of sexism is the kind that’s quiet and pervasive. that sits and lurks and slips out of the mouths of men that you like and trust. when people casually dismiss your humanity and don’t even realize they’ve done exactly that. when it’s so casual and natural that sometimes you don’t even catch it.""  
  
Casual sexism shouldn't be trivialized. It undermines women and, in this case I think, lays down groundwork that her (OP's) value lies in her physical appearance.  
Just because that's not how things used to be, doesn't mean that it's okay for older-ish people to get away with it. No one would tolerate the use of the n-word or any other racial slur in the workplace today. But it was acceptable 30 or 40 years ago. People (middle-aged men) can learn to readjust and curb their sexism and racism. "

This is exactly what I try to put across when people say Moyes failed by not signing anyone.

hermithome,AskHistorians,1389314642.0,"&gt;But as an analogy, suppose you are a murderer but somehow you need an accomplice to help destroy the evidence. So you blackmail or otherwise force, through terrible means, someone to assist you. What is riskier? To keep using that same person? Or to kill them in 4 months and find a new accomplice? You ""learn"" the person. You see how they are dealing with the situation. You learn to recognize strange behaviour. Each new person is a new unknown.

No, no, no, no. You've got this completely backwards. The person you are forcing is locked down. You know that they have no love for you and would do anything to get out of the situation and it doesn't matter because you have them locked down. The more time you give them, the longer you allow them to survive, the more they learn and adapt. They 'learn' you, not the other way around. They learn the way the camp operates and it's weaknesses. They have time to strategise and plan. You want to keep those people from having time to adapt and to learn. You don't want to learn them because there's no fucking point.

You can get around this theoretically, if you can find the 'right ones'. But you're assuming that 'the right ones' exist and also that the Nazis give a flying fuck about keeping their labour. This is really basic manual labour. There's no learning curve on the job, the only learning curve that exists disadvantages the Nazis. There's no reason not to replace labour regularly.

No only is your plan not-necessarily feasible, but it has tonnes of unnecessary risk. Why make a job harder and add risk to it? That's kinda nuts.

And yes, you can find 'brutal, callous, selfish, self-serving men'. But taking those men and putting them in a position of forced labour with no power or control is going to make them resentful and angry. The reason Kapos worked is because they were given power and control. Because some people deal with abuse by abusing others. 

Sonderkommando weren't accomplices. They were prisoners doing forced labour. There's no reason to invest time in attempting to find Sonderkommando that you can trust, or at least trust to look out for their own skin. Because there's no way of doing that. Because people are not going to side with the captors making them drag the bodies of their neighbours for as little as a bit extra to eat. Maybe for a bit, but they'll start to plan. Even if their plans don't involve helping the others, they'll plan their own jailbreak. There is nothing that the Nazis have that they can present to simply get docile, obedient workers who won't want to leave. And moreover, the Nazis have no reason to try and find people like this.

You seem to think the Nazis should have carefully chosen Sonderkommando based on personality and then watched and learned and adapted to them. I'd suggest a lot of basic reading, because you seem to seriously not get any of the power dynamics involved. "

Dissociative episodes are varied, but often include markedly different behaviour - especially behaviour not appropriate to the situation: like a person having a meltdown and then suddenly being super enthusiastic and happy; or perhaps going deadpan in response to certain triggers. They often have memory blocks, whether one-way, both ways, and/or temporary.

It's very rare/nearly unheard of to have complete and separate personalities a la Jekyll/Hyde. Dissociation itself is entirely real and not at all contested.

Schizophrenia isn't dissociative, but it does have hallucinations which (particularly aural hallucinations) can be indicative of a separation between the observing mind and the parts of the mind which are not identified as the 'self'; as well as a break down in mental processes, leading to symptoms such as 'word salad' and/or having a break down between the things words mean and the things words sound like."

mrcleanup,relationship_advice,1389314834.0,"I understand how important this feels to you, but I have to agree with Kanga-Pie. I felt the same at 17. Here's the thing... your body and your brain are in the middle of the biggest period of change in your life. You will literally be a different person at 25 than you are now because your brain is adding new material to it's cognitive regions. You will think and want different things at 25 than you do now.

For right now, that means that you need to view your relationships right now as learning experiences to explore what relationships can be and not as training for marriage.

The fact of the matter is that Kanga-Pie is right when she calls bullshit on you believing that your girlfriend is more important than life itself. At what point did you suddenly realize she wouldn't be OK with you sexting this other girl? Why didn't you realize it before you did ever started? Why didn't that stop you? Why did you jeopardize something ""more important than life?"" The answer is because you are being driven by your instincts and emotions, and you are still getting to know who you are, who you can be, who you want to be, what a relationship can be, and what a relationship can be.

We all make mistakes and learn from them. The good news is that you are 17 and this is the right time to be doing it. If you were my son, I would be telling you that you needed to date other girls whether or not you had screwed up. The fact of the matter is that just like ice cream, you can try a single flavor and swear to me that you will love that flavor and never love another, but until you sample other flavors, I know you just don't have anything to compare it to. Ice cream is wonderful, and relationships are too, but honestly, you could have the worst flavor and think it is wonderful because you haven't tried any others and even the worst has its benefits."

AnyelevNokova,relationships,1389314873.0,"I would have taken it straight to my manager and, as politely as possible, asked to *please god* never have you as a customer again. There's actually a few customers that come into my store regularly that I've told management I *will not* interact with because they've made me uncomfortable. I've told them that if I see them come in, I'm going to take a fiver out back or go work on a project until they leave. 

**Things that are ok:**

- ""You have such a pretty smile!"" or ""You're so sweet!"" or ""You look lovely today!"" or other non-sexual compliment. *Hint: if you'd say it to your 8 year old niece, it's ok to say here.*

- ""You're the best waitress/server/whatever I've had in a long time!""

- ""Don't work too hard, sweetheart!""

**Things that are not ok:** (*these are the things I've been told by the aforementioned dodged customers*)

- ""Why is it that such a pretty girl like you is working a job like this? With badonkadonks like those, you should be much higher up, you know what I'm saying? Put those girls to work!""

- ""So, you single? Ah come on girl, you know I like you. What's it going to take to get you to go out with me? I come in here just to hear your pretty voice and see that nice body. Whoever you've got, he won't treat you half as nice as I will.""

- ""So what size of jeans do you have to wear to cram that fine ass into?"" also ""What size are those, DDs? DDDs? It's ok, I won't tell.""

Bottom line? If it's a non-sexual compliment that you could say to a child, then say it. If it's sexual or outright hitting on her, *don't*. I'm sure there's a small percentage of women who will say, ""oh come on, I'd love it if a person came into my place of employment and told me how sexy they thought I was"", but I think it's safe to say that, for most of us, it would come across as sexual harassment. It's even worse when it's a customer because in a lot of CS jobs, you're told to bend over backwards to make them happy, and customers expect you to treat them like VIPs. There's no easy way to tell a customer to fuck off without risking your job, so you feel trapped and intimidated.

Wiskie,offmychest,1389314873.0,"I think there are legitimate ways of ""lighting a fire under somebody's ass"" that can and do motivate people to start thinking about what changes they can make to live healthier lives. 

I also think the world is a cruel place where this sort of ...how should I say... ""encouragement"" might be misconstrued as being mean for no reason. Indeed, there are a lot of angry people (probably with their own problems) who are mean for no reason.

I think if you are overweight and unhappy, the onus is on you to change it, and I would go a step further to say that if you are exceptionally overweight, you can probably expect to catch some flack for it. If you're uncomfortable with that, it is infinitely easier for you to change yourself than to change the world's perceptions. 

At the same time, I personally don't like calling someone out for being fat *unless* it's relevant to the conversation we're having and I know the person well enough to call them a friend. For example, when my buddy who is overweight complains that ""girls don't like nice guys"" and that's why they're not into him, I can't help but mention that the reason girls don't like him is because he has *chosen* not to make an effort to look attractive to them, not because he's ""nice"" or whatever bullshit he's spouting."

I got a modified 4.0L warrantied after I shelled it, mainly because I was in Montana. Ford didn't see many cases of modified Mustangs in the area so they just assumed it was a fluke and didn't ask questions (and the dealership hooked me up, obviously).

Depending on where you live, you might be able to get away with a CAI and tune. It's up to you if you want to risk it. I've heard that reflashing back to the stock tune looks the same as removing the negative batt cable for about 20 minutes, causing the computer to reset.

Oddmanout259,fireemblem,1389315040.0,"My main piece of advice is to let your units level to 20 before you master seal them or second seal them. Also, the main reason people talk about getting people to level 20 many many times is that they use the DLC. One of the DLC maps (I don't have any of the DLC so I don't know names) gives you level for every enemy you beat IIRC. Another thing is that Donnel gets godlike late game if you have the patience to get him and train him. I always paired him with Kellam until he could do things on his own. I would say that there can be typical people who scale well, but I usually get a different set of people each playthrough due to RNG screwing different characters. Also, to get the most experience to your other characters try to avoid using Frederick. He can be a kind of Exp sponge. This typically happens with the advanced class character you get early in the Fire Emblem games"

WraithPDX,AskReddit,1389315088.0,"Was working for a very, large entertainment company that many of you in the US will know but shall not be named. I was printing out some paperwork for whatever reason and mixed in with my promotion reports and marketing material is porn. Tons of porn. Weird part is that whoever printed it forgot that when you print certain files (PDF's, JPEG's, etc.) it prints out a report of what computer it was on, whose login was being used, and where the file was located. Dipshit brought in a CD/DVD filled with porn and printed it out on the wrong printer. He got fired very quickly.


And because I can, I may as well own up that I got fired from the exact same place! Me and my then-wife worked there but in different departments. We also used to get kinky with some of co-workers and have threesomes with them. Well, we used our personal emails at work to figure out what employee we would try to invite over next, but every so often we would use company email, but very, VERY toned down to the point you wouldn't have a clue what the hell we were talking about. Well, since the company was sold and management was replaced with a bunch of dipshits, I made myself a target by butting heads with the new department head because he didn't know shit and didn't like an hourly-wage worker telling him how to do his job, never mind I worked 3 different departments in my time there. Well, he managed to find out what the emails were about (presumably from remote access viewing my monitor during my breaks/lunch) and fired us both on the spot.

We really did deserve it since we were abusing company email by not using it for work reasons only, but the fact they fired me when I was one of the best employees they had and the *only* employee who knew certain departments inside and out was stupid, especially since we were using personal email for the graphic stuff. I found out later that at least two, possibly three co-workers quit in protest at our firings. Ultimately, I don't care since they went out of business after a huge bankruptcy after that new management ran it into the ground.

**TL;DR:** Guy printed out porn on a department printer and it was mixed in with all our corporate docs. I also got fired from the same place for arranging threesomes during company time. No regrets."

potato1,TwoXChromosomes,1389315180.0,"I think it should be obvious that my previous comment was not a mere appeal to authority, and your attempt to discredit it on that basis without any further discussion is unfounded and an example of the fallacy fallacy. I was introducing Popper's name in the hopes that you would look further into the subject since I don't think quoting large swaths of wikipedia at you is going to be productive. 

&gt;There are no claims one can make about reality which are outside the purview of science.

Incorrect. Such claims exist, and are often called metaphysical claims, since they do not describe physical, measurable phenomena. 

&gt;If you are making a claim about reality that cannot be investigated scientifically, then you are simply speaking nonsense and have no business making the claim in the first place.

You could call that ""simply speaking nonsense,"" and many philosophers do, which they do by referring such claims ""non-meaningful"" rather than Popper's ""unscientific.""

&gt;The tools of science are the only tools available when it comes to investigating reality. And you don't get to make claims about reality while exempting yourself from the use of those tools. Period.

Nobody is ""exempting themselves"" from anything. The fact is, metaphysical claims cannot be investigated using scientific inquiry or analysis, because they're not predictive of physical phenomena and are unfalsifiable. If I don't buy anything that is subject to sales tax, I'm not ""exempting myself"" from sales tax, I'm just not interacting with sales tax laws in any way."

You might feel in love with her and 5yrs is a lot to give up. But if she's behaving this way then you're winning the long game. 

You need to spend sometime alone and reflect on whether or not you legitimately want to BE with her, or if you're just afraid of change.

I'm currently in the same boat as you(-3yrs/-engagement) and when I'm completely honest with myself, while I do love her very much, the real thing that I don't want to lose is the companionship.

The leather should be almost dry. (It should feel cool to the touch, but not damp.) Hold the beveling tool not quite straight up and down, but at a slight angle away from you, so that the tip is pressed further into the groove. Then give it a good hard smack. It takes a bit of practice to get it down, but that comes with time. Don't be afraid to hit it harder if it's not going deep enough at first. Also, when starting out you don't have to go fast, so take the time to line up each hit carefully before bringing the mallet down. Over time it will get easier and you will find yourself moving quicker.

janedjones,AskWomen,1389315876.0,"I know about all about PTSD, and flashbacks. I've worked in the VA for almost a decade, and in domestic violence shelters for women and kids. My previous job involved going to the ER whenever a woman showed up after being raped--hold her hand during the exams and protect her from the onslaught of the cops asking questions, and then drive her to the shelter afterwards and get her settled in. 

I apply the lessons I learned there to the soldiers I've been with. My sniper, for instance, was a gorgeous young man (seriously could've modeled) with black hair and blue eyes... he should've had his pick of any woman he wanted. But he was so scared, all the time. He wanted to be with me, for awhile anyway, because I was calm and patient. I understood why he needed to check under the bed and behind the door all the time. I knew better than to do anything like sneak up on him, always made noise and talked out loud when he was around... and he knew that I understood and accepted him just the way he was.

But I don't *romanticize* him or my husband (who never saw combat but does have MH issues) or anyone else I was with. They went into the military because they had no other way to pay for college. They're all very flawed and very damaged. And I wasn't out to 'fix' any of them... just to be with them. Love and comfort them however I could. 

Yeah, soldiers and vets can be violent off the battlefield. So can cops, firefighters, and doctors like me, for that matter. But while I have been a victim of abuse myself, not one of the men who has hurt me was ever in the military. Not one cop or firefighter or name-that-stereotypically -violent-type in the bunch. 
 
These days, in addition to my day job, I'm also moonlighting online as a counselor for a few vets and police officers who have varying degrees of PTSD. The stories they tell are just fucking horrendous... only a real psychopath could go through *that* and not be scarred. 

But none of them make me scared, because they're the ones who've sought help and just want to be normal again. The ones who are utterly fucked up and don't give a shit about it... those are the ones that are easy to spot, are scary as shit, and whom I would never, never get involved with."

What if I told you the previous year, with LeBeau as DC, those rankings were 2nd and 4th? So he inherited an already elite defense and only his first season he was able to maintain a top 10 defense.

* 2000 New Orleans. This was his first year as a Head Coach. The defense ranked 8th for yards and 10th for points given up. This time he didn't inherit a well-performing defense, but each year after this was worse. And ever since, he's never coached a defense that was top 10.

FrenchFuck,AskMen,1389316009.0,"Emasculation is a negative logic, defined by what is ""not a man"". Every man has a completely arbitrary and relative notion of what ""being a man"" means to him. Whenever he crosses that line his ideology pings back to him ""you're not a real man"". The problem is that men don't realize this line is arbitrary, they think it's the ""natural"" line. Furthermore they believe this line should be maintained if only ""for appearances"", the more extreme advocates call this ""protecting the bedrock of society"". Therein lies their logic, society is built upon this *arbitrary* definition of masculinity.  

Every culture has it's implied rules but there are some universals such as ""being tough"". Basically it means overcoming reality, it means being a ""super hero"". That's what every little boy dreams off - saving the world, or rather, being man so far out of reach no one stands near him. Frozen in a fantasy.

When you don't have any realistic or positive images of masculinity you're immediately going to be polarized to an extreme. My claim is that the reason so many men feel emasculated is because we are doing a shit job at educating and empowering young men. It's a complete waste of potential and we, as a society, suffer. We have all the young men without any confidence or direction trying to become superheros in modern context, which means escapism: video games, drugs, alcohol, violence, etc

Men feel emasculated through their own concept of masculinity that subsists for the lack of any others. This is what I talk about over and over. This Void. They feel guilty for not being what, they believe, every man simply should be, namely, a myth. They seek masculinity by peering into the past, trying to build a narrative of manliness by cherrypicking history. Look at the mental masturbation fest that is Frank Miller's 300. This is the archetype I am speaking about. A black and white world of honor vs horror. 

The ultimate myth: Civilization being saved by the **self-sacrifice** of honorable men. 

The task for **every man** is to define masculinity for himself. If a man can overcome the arbitrary social, cultural and self-imposed roles then he can be who he actually is. A unique human being. The choice is a question of self-determination. Either you sacrifice yourself willingly to the whims of society or take responsibility for your humanity and take a stand.

The regular lobe healed totally fine like the first, but the cartilage one was a little rough. It looks totally fine, but I gave it a couple months before I took the ring out to clean it. When I did, it had a bit of a smell, but again looked ok. I think the important thing is keeping it clean.

I do understand, and that's normal

&gt;I'm worried about making this girl as happy as I can and giving her the guy she deserves.

That doesn't reassure me, it actually does the opposite. You shouldn't have to do that. Spending time with her should naturally make both of you happy at this stage. The fact that you want to ""make her happy"" so badly makes me guess that what you are really getting is a boost to your feeling of self worth by improving her situation, and not that you both really love who each other are. 

In a good relationship, you find someone that when you show them the dark uncertain, shameful corners of your soul, they show you theirs back, they relate, and you gain strength in the sharing. It isn't actions you do or learning how to behave, it is a mutual appreciation of who you actually are. Who you currently are.

So do that. Show this girl the dark corners of your soul (including embarrassment, fear, and shame), it will be clear pretty quickly whether it draws her in or pushes her away, if it pushes her away, then it isn't who you are that she loved, it was the things you did for her, and anyone could do those things."

snellk,LifeProTips,1389316361.0,"I completed my undergraduate degree while working part time and fitting in some volunteer crap for resume beef. It kind of forced me into creating schedules to follow so that I could get through my days. I'm doing a master's now and don't work, so I have a lot more wiggle room but I still like to plan out my days. 

Since you said you work and you have classes, I'd start by writing in all those shifts/classes/labs/tutorials/etc in the calendar. Give yourself however much time necessary for travel to/from home/work. You'll (hopefully) start to see some holes in your schedule where you can try to fit in scheduled time to do school work. Even if you only have 20-30 minutes or something small at a time, you'd still be able to get bits and pieces done. Sometimes it helped (for me) to schedule myself 30-45 minutes to work on a paper or an assignment because I knew I had to be productive the entire time. If I scheduled a 2 hour block I had time to dick around and not do much work. Start to schedule in blocks of time to work on assignments/papers/whatever. I don't know if you can effectively gauge how much time an assignment will take you, but hopefully since you're in third year now you can. Give yourself enough blocks of time to finish whatever you need to work on. Again, you might have to do this in very small segments throughout your week.

I like using my phone/computer for a day to day schedule. I don't include anything about due dates in this. I have a MacBook and an iPhone and the iCal that comes with both syncs automatically. For assignment due dates I use a giant 4-month white board calendar that I have on the wall next to my bed. This is where I write down all my due dates, and I can see the entire semester at once. Since I see it every day I don't really feel the need to include due dates in my electronic calendar, but you could also add due dates as 'full day' items or something like that in Google Calendar or iCal.

If you have a standard work/school schedule you will hopefully fall into a routine fairly quickly and won't have to check your schedule all the time to know what you're supposed to be working on in between class and work.

Hopefully my approach helps a bit :)"

DenryM,comicbooks,1389316377.0,"""wall of text"" is such a shitty way to say ""i didn't really read any of that, maybe i skimmed it... But it's your fault for writing so many words!"" 

Maybe innate was the wrong word to use, then. If that makes you happy. And I explained it as best I could, so if you're looking for someone to *prove* it then look elsewhere. I really don't have the time to prove such obvious concepts to some person on the internet who likely won't read it anyways. 

You called comics sequential art. I used relatively common words, I think. I really don't know why you're trying to turn the pseudo intellectual comment against me. Just admit that you called it that to make it sound more distinguished, as if it needs justification to be discussed on a deeper level than ""lol violence! Cool"". I remember when I used to do that. You'll grow out of it.

Internexus,AskMen,1389316446.0,"Open:  I was with my high school sweetheart for 13 years, 5 of which we were married.  

Event:  The marriage slowly fell apart over the last year, she felt she missed out on life by marrying young and had fallen out of love with me as time went on.  I was pursuing a lifelong dream and this meant moving to another city.  I planned and prepared for half a year in order to sell the home and get us moved into a new home with hopes of everything being better.  When the time comes she tells me she's staying behind to live on her own.  A short period later I invite her up to stay the night after I've settled in, with hopes of things moving forward but instead it's only worse in all aspects.  

Climax:  After she left we spoke on the phone that evening and I knew at that point that she was gone forever.  While on the phone I can't help but register that 13 years of my life are gone.  Wasted.  As I'm processing this realization my hand is wrapped firmly around my gun with the barrel firmly against my skull.  My finger squeezing the trigger to the point that I knew I was at the break point of the trigger, all I had to do was squeeze a quarter of an inch more and this sick nightmare I was living would turn to darkness. 

Close:  I overcame that long evening somehow, and returned a different being.  It's 4 years later now and I look back with zero regret of filing the divorce papers myself.  The event forced me to dig deep and find my will to survive, overcome, and become a stronger individual all around."

pizzaandburritos,seduction,1389316470.0,"This might be good advice if the goal is to create an air of mystery. But what then? There's no point in piquing a girl's interest if you can't take it to the next step.

If you share some information about yourself, girls who are interested in you will use that to gauge whether they would go on a date with you. And as a girl, I can say that a big reason I say no a lot of times when asked out is that I don't have enough information. If I feel like I have a bit of an idea of who you are via facebook, I might be likelier to say yes. 

Moreover, if you post some stuff, you can see who amongst your facebook friends might be into you, which they will indicate by liking and comment on your stuff. 

I agree that you should be tactful about what you post and be cautious of spending too much time on facebook, but I think it can also be a valuable tool. Once you become fb friends with a girl you like, it can be a great way to flirt. Don't ask her out immediately after friending her - and don't friend people on fb just to ask them out, either. It's lame. But if you do build something of an online friendship, then you can ask her out. Also, don't chat just to chat. ""Hey, what's up?"" is really lame. The whole point of fb is that it's loaded with conversation starters. If you like a girl, then once in a while, comment on something she posts and go from there. Better to comment on something recent and also something that already has a lot of likes or comments.

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1389316570.0,"I'm slightly conflicted on this. It does sound like he genuinely wants you and enjoys being in a relationship with you. He might just have his own personal level of... love. For example, some people are just incredibly overly affectionate and others aren't as much. So maybe on his level you rank high up, but he doesn't have the capacity to feel as intensely about relationships as you do. If you can handle his independence it could work. If you need someone who you feel like can return your emotions 100% then he's probably not the guy for you.

You need to be really careful though. This could also be a matter of him just not feeling as much for you as he should. He might have the ability to be more attached, just not with you. As harsh as that is, it happens and it's common. You need to have a talk about the future. Are you someone he could see himself marrying (or whatever you guys want to do)? 

I guess you just have to decide if it's worth it. Is pursuing him on the chance that things end and you end up in a different city worse than not moving but wondering what if? 

This is something you *really* need to sort out. You can't go while questioning your relationship. You need a solid yes or no. If you're okay with this, then that's you. Some people can deal with a situation like this, others can't. Just make sure you're 100% on what you want to do before making any decisions. "

DanniGat,rpg,1389316571.0,"Nothing to the level of you but sit awhile and I shall regale you with the tale of ""Grog"" the barbarian.

Grog was a simple barbarian, and boy do I mean simple, the powers of speech eluded him. His favorite food was Grog, his favorite drink was Grog, his best friend was Grog, and that was a Grog that was pulling the Grog down to the Grog so that they could sell some Grogs.

But onto how he because entirely out of my control, the party liked him, in fact after 15 levels of adventuring Grog was the sole surviving founder of the adventuring party, he always did what he had to to survive, he wasn't smart enough to think of self sacrifice. After all these years spent adventuring together (about 8 in game time) the party all most of their associates had come to know exactly what Grog meant when Grog Grogged. In fact they began to refer to things as Grog in his presence so he might understand that they didn't always want him to go in foaming at the mouth and burying his axe in the closest enemies face, but Grog kept being Grog. 

As we encountered the over-villian of the whole campaign, Grog in his infinite Grogy-ness decided that when the bard asked ""Why shouldnt we just beat your face in?"" it was a rhetorical question. He ran up and went 'full Grog' as it became known on the villian, who was quite unprepared for the sound Grogging he got. The party is trying to decided if they should run or if they should help, when Grog in a moment of pure unadulterated Groginess made his 3 attacks... and rolled instant death on all three (9 20's in a row). The villain was reduced to a pile of goo in the middle of a monologue. Grog, for single handedly defeating the enemy about 6 months to soon, was promptly burned to death by an irritated DM who may or may not have had to put up with Grog ruining his subtle plans much to the amusement of other players.

TL;DR Grog the barbarian's hugely sucessful career of killing things came to an end when an irritated GM got tired of him doing what he did best no matter what he tried to do to prevent it, and grabbed his characte sheet and burned it.

Edit: for anyone who may be interested in the math its something like a .000,000,000,001,953,125~ % chance, or a ""If you even hear of this being done you will never ever ever actually see it happen in the next ten generations of your family"" likelyhood... LONG LIVE GROG!"

dakru,AskMen,1389316658.0,"&gt; I have been picked on, put in the friend zone, had horrible break ups etc and they make me really upset but they didn't make me feel less of a woman. Maybe, is there no comparison for women? I can't even think of a word that fits...

Emasculation usually involves some sort of implication that a man is weak or incapable. Why does this matter so much to men? Why are women less bothered when the same thing happens to them? It's because men have traditionally been (and continue to be) valued (as a person and as a partner) for their capability, their utility, and their success.

Women, on the other hand, have traditionally been (and continue to be) valued (as a person and as a partner) for their beauty and sexuality. Thus the equivalent to men worrying about being seen as weak or incapable is women worrying about being seen as fat, ugly, and physically undesirable.

I think the stereotypical man who's too proud to stop and ask for directions is the equivalent to the stereotypical woman who's overly concerned with make-up and takes a really long time to get ready to go out. The man is trying to avoid being weak and incapable because he knows how those traits won't take a man very far in our society, and the woman is trying to avoid being unsightly and unattractive because she knows how those traits won't take a woman very far in our society.

Both of them in that example take it to a certain extreme, of course, but at the core they're really just responding to social pressures. And because the other side doesn't experience the same pressures to the same extent, they both like to make fun of the other: ""oh silly men with their egos!"" / ""oh silly women with their beauty products!"".

To be honest it would be fairly difficult to prove (or even speculate), because of how little knowledge we could have of how humans behaved 100,000+ years ago.

I couldn't find a source, it was some reddit comment a while ago last time I saw persistence hunting mentioned who said it probably wasn't a main source of meat. He had a citation but I can't find it now, I realize that's not terribly helpful.

In any case humans evolved to be bipedal in order to give us larger distances that we could travel for the purposes of situating ourselves in a more friendly environment. A side effect of that is our effectiveness at running long distances which allows us to persistence hunt when necessary. Obviously this doesn't disprove persistence hunting, but I thought it worth mentioning.

I'm sure it happened occasionally but I personally doubt based on my own speculation and how energy intensive/time consuming of a form of hunting it is that it was our primary source of hunting before projectile weapons. We probably just hunted smaller animals or relied more on fruit, berries, etc."

That's another thing, please look up your ""good sumaritan"" laws. Some states grant immunity for legal action for good sumaritans. Others do not, for instance if you do CPR on someone and break ribs, they can sue you. Most don't since they realize that it was to save their life, but just be aware of it.

Edit: forgot to address the pregnancy part, since you won't know if they are pregnant or not, still call 911. Let EMS handle the details and getting a full health history.

115MRD,LosAngeles,1389317092.0,"Correct. The DWP provides water and power at the same, or slightly cheaper rates than do most private companies. Despite the issues of the DWP folks should remember that companies like So Cal Edison are private corporations who's goal is profit, not providing a service. Imagine if DWP just skimmed millions from their budget to pay their CEO and shareholders. 

All utility companies have issues because unlike other services, water, power and gas have to be local monopolies. You can't have competing companies providing water and electrical services without major logistical, safety, and technical issues. That's why it makes the most sense to have publicly owned monopolies that are designed to provide a service rather than earn a profit. That being said, the DWP has had issues for years, but I suspect political pressure is mounting to a breaking point and reforms are coming."

JohnTesh,NewOrleans,1389317299.0,"CrossFit Nola has three locations with varying degrees of platforms. 

The one uptown has four or five ""platforms"" that have a plywood surface that is flush with the padded floor. Each one has a fully adjustable rack with removable arms so you can use them as a safety bar for benching (or squatting I suppose). The plates are bumpers, so you can drop them as much as you like.

The midcity location has two raised platforms with racks, but also another 10 or so racks that are just on the floor with ample room for the lifter. Again, all plates are bumpers, but this time only the raised platforms have plywood. The rest of the flooring is a very dense padding with a high friction no slip surface. Drop weights if you want, bail on missed lifts no prob.

I have not been to the third location on magazine, but I assume they also have platforms.

Power lifting and oly lifting are very heavily respected and practiced at cf nola."

Uriah refused to return home until the battle was won, so David commanded Uriah go to the front lines, effectively killing him.  He then married Bathsheba. 

In the beginning, David first noticed Bathsheba when he was looking out and ""saw her bathing in the roof"".

After you've done your drywall and you're ready to replace the baseboard, leave a notch on the bottom again, and once you've put the baseboard back over, replace the missing piece and caulk the seams. It won't look pretty up close, but it's in a corner so it shouldn't matter too much.

feedmahfish,askscience,1389317815.0,"I don't like the first answer to that question in the link you posted.  Invasions happen all the time.  In fact, it's why biogeography is such a fun field to get into.

Species expand outwards and encroach on other ranges ALL the time.  However, the truth is that the definition gets tenuous.  I'll be the one to start a firestorm by defining it in very neutral terms:

A species is an invader if it enters and occupies a niche or habitat it was absent from or never occupied previously.  I welcome all debate into this as I know some fellow ecologists will probably double take on that.  It's the best I can think of anyway.

So, species ranges are not set in stone and you'll see them in spots on their documented periphery where you never did before.  Thus, if you consider Locality A and locality B, Species 1 from Locality A enters Locality B, finds it suitable to live in, and settles.  Species 1 is therefore an invader.  Species 2 is found in Locality B, but doesn't invade Locality A and stays in B.  Thus, for this example, we can decide that Species 1 is an invader in B and a native in A while species 2 is a native to B.

A species can not occupy a niche or habitat if it is not equipped to utilize resources or compete with species occupying them already.  No species enters into a habitat without stiff competition from what's there.  Thus, the most common invasive species we find today are those who are not only successful in their home niche, but were evolutionarily flexible enough to be able to expand outwards if given just the bare minimum conditions.  Thus, this example is a natural invasion and happens all the time, just the scale is small and the effects are not as dangerous as landscape and global transportation of organisms by humans.  For a good example of invasive dynamics at small scales, look up Huffaker's famous experiment with mites and oranges.  Thus, we define the spatial scale at which a species is native and invasive in the wild.

On to human caused invasions, the effects can be devestating because we transport species across landscapes and natural barriers like mountains, saltwater, deserts, and tundras.  For example, carps are established quite comfortably in the United States, even though they are native to China.  And it is due to human trafficking that they are found pretty much world wide.  Black basses like Largemouth bass and small mouth are so popular around the world for sport fishing, that they've been imported as far as Japan.  Red-swamp crayfish are so delicious and economically easy to grow that they are found in Africa... where there are no native crayfish!  

When is a species no longer considered invasive?  At the appropriate scale.  No species is invasive at the global scale, since we all occupy the planet, but it can be at all landscape, ecosystem, community, and population scales.  Yes, even within species can be invaders if you think about two genepools and one of them comes to intermingle with the other to make one big genepool.  A cool concept actually.

Also, a species is no longer considered invasive *in effects* if you consider the inclusion of that species into the natural processes of the ecosystem.  If the ecosystem is sustainable even with the new invader, then you might want to think that the invader is now an important energy component to that system.  Humans are the best example.  We cut down forests, harvest the oceans.  But the ecosystem adapts after so many species leave for other habitats or die off, and the species left behind work with humans to maintain the energy dynamics of the system for everyone's survival.  We understand that more than ever.

Areat,worldnews,1389317818.0,"Let's have the government's side of the story here.            

In France like in most develloped countries, there is laws against *price dumping*. It's very easy for large corporation who have net profit from other sales to sell a specific product, like books, below the price it even cost to produce as to eliminate competition, and then go back to whatever price they decide, having effectively created a quasi monopole.               
Small book sellers can't do shit alone against such *unfair competition*, which is again something not only France but the UE itself did decide to regulate.                 

Amazon not paying any taxes in France is also to take into account there.                     

Also, it's not a battle between a modern amazon and old geezers figthing against progress who somehow would want you to keep buying the usual way and only this way. Most booksellers in France already organise themselves as to do these internet sales the way amazon or others do it. The profit margin is already quite thin from the start, so they just want such book sales to follow laws against unfair competition, wether it's by hand or on the net.

Don't get me wrong, the DRL is the single most pressing transit need in Toronto, maybe even the GTA. But assuming *every* rider on a streetcar is heading downtown and would be better served by a straight route replacement is dangerous."

In the end I don't think any answer is right, or wrong. It all comes down to personal choice. Some people have children to enrich their lives. 

I chose NOT to have children to enrich my life in different ways. 

For some people it comes naturally, and they excel at it. For me the thought is completely foreign. There is nothing about having a child that sounds appealing in the slightest. I'm just lucky enough to have a wife who feels the exact same way I do. 

Unlike some in this sub who demonize people who have children I take it on a case by case basis. There are some people that absolutely should not be having kids under any circumstance. Unfortunately those are the ones who usually have the most. 

Occasionally I meet people and say, ""Those are fantastic parents."" 

The simple answer to your question for me is this:

There is no good reason I have found to have a child of my own. None whatsoever. I'm not going to pretend that the thought doesn't repulse me on an instinctual level. Of course this is only speaking for me and no one else. "

Drowning usually refers to suffocation as a direct result of submersion in water.  In the fish's case, its suffocation is not due to it being in water, but due to other causes.

With a looser definition of ""drown,"" you could certainly make the argument that the fish is drowning, though.

Gertiel,NoStupidQuestions,1389317955.0,"He just gets paid in cash for what he does for the most part. He tends bar, does odd jobs and mowing, and that sort of thing. He used to take checks for a lot of the odd jobs and mowing, but got away from it after some bad experiences with bad checks. He used to go to the trouble of driving it all to the bank to deposit, but that got old, so he quit. He has a safe in his home somewhere I don't even know, or so he has said before. He has no particular distrust for credit cards, just sees them as someone else's way to make a buck off of his hard work. Apparently he used to have at least one, but the one time he had a minor emergency and tried to use it, he found it had been canceled for lack of use. 

As far as buying a house with cash, as I said, some closing companies disallow it. Apparently didn't want to be responsible for that much cash. I suppose if they never deal in anything but checks, they stop having any sort of arrangements in place for cash. I don't think purchasing with cash has anything to do with the owners as they just get their portion of the proceeds from the title company he does the closing at. I'd suspect they probably prefer cash since there would probably be a faster turn-around time, but that's just a guess. My understanding is he's not the only one around here who wants to use cash, though I don't know anyone else doing it by name. I suspect other than bargain houses, it would get unwieldy, but I'm just guessing. Twenty thousand in 100's is only so big, but 200,000 would be awfully heavy to drag around.

As far as a normal life goes...er...well. He's as normal as most around here. Drives a big 1-ton pickup truck, has an ex, a couple of kids he dotes on, and a hunting dog. Disappears a lot of long weekends in duck and deer season. He credits never paying bank fees or interest as the reason he's so successful, though I think hard work has a bit to do with it as well."

ironic_mustache_ride,sex,1389318097.0,"The size/girth of your dick is not the issue that broke up your 5 year relationship. That really is a cheap cop-out. I'm gonna use some shitty girl logic to attempt to figure out what is going on here:

She may have found someone that she developed a crush on, and yes, probably fucked this person. Maybe the guy had a thicker dick and she dumped all of her unhealthy resentments for you on this one issue. It's a particularly shitty move, because she is calling into question your ability, as a man, to please her. 

But...there was in fact a time when you were able to please her. Every time you two fucked she would have an orgasm...what changed??

She was probably faking her O's the entire time. I mean...that's my guess. What kind of sick bitch would do this, you ask? Probably the kind of sick bitch that would fuck around on you behind your back after you declared your intention to marry her and blamed the end of your relationship on a simple physical trait that for the majority of your relationship did not seem to be the issue. 

All of this could have been avoided if she was honest and told you how to please her to a real climax. But she lied, and probably for all 5 years she was lying. She seems like she does not possess the ability to communicate with her partner in an open and honest manner, and this very petty issue snowballed out of control. In a healthy relationship, you two would have talked about what gets you both off and...problem solved. If this was the only problem, you two would probably be cruising sex toy shops right now. 

She's a good liar, and the very best liars don't make up completely fabricated stories. They take a little truth and manipulate it to their advantage. She wanted out of this relationship with no questions asked, and used your dick size as a way to fill you with hurtful emotions. Instead of asking her logical questions like what happened, what can we do, what changed, you're now left asking ""what's wrong with me,"" allowing her to run off without having to talk about it. 

 You: ""Look, this is killing me. I love you but this all seems so fucked up and ludicrous. Is this really about my dick or is it something else???""

Her: she just looks around the room, shaking her head and shrugging her shoulders

She couldn't even be bothered to explain herself? Nice.

almightybob1,worldnews,1389318185.0,"&gt; Women still earn only 77 cents to every dollar a man makes.

For fuck's sake. This has been debunked over and over and over. How do people still think this is true?

If you compare people doing the same job with the same experience and the same education etc (i.e. the only comparison that is actually worth anything) the pay difference between men and women is so small as to be negligible. There is only a big difference if you compare people in different roles. For example if you look at a massive category like ""financial services"", you might see women earning 85% of what men earn. But there's so many different roles it's meaningless. What's the point in comparing a female financial secretary with a male accountant? Of course the man will earn more. [Hopefully this short video will explain that the wage gap is a myth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwogDPh-Sow).

This is trivially obvious if you conduct a simple thought experiment: what would you do, as an employer, if you could pay a woman 77% of what you would need to pay a man to do the same job? The answer is obvious: you would only hire women. Female unemployment would be nearly 0%. A woman would get the job over a man every time. But that doesn't happen, because women and men get paid pretty much the same for doing the same job. Any difference in salaries is almost entirely due to the career choices women and men make."

1) Is your company actually unable to change your email without a legal name change?

Hell, that would be potentially discriminatory in certain situations, as there are a number of immigrants who use a different professional name than their legal name.

There's no reason that people other than management need to know about your legal business, and there's no reason that anyone needs to know your medical business.

In terms of the implant, I love it so far, but it's a total crap shoot where side effects are concerned. It's got better reviews than Implanon (which is the slightly older implant option), so there's been some improvements with Nexplanon including with the insertion process. I personally experienced as side effects: light bruising and soreness at the insertion site, small headaches, increased anxiety, increased depression, and abdominal pain. It was not all at once; the side effects seemed to alternate on different days for me. Though uncomfortable, I did not feel that any of my side effects were unbearable. So, like with other forms of HBC, it was just about pushing through until my body adjusted to the hormones. EDIT: I should also add, the side effects I experienced were typical of my history with ALL HBC (always seem to get the same side effects regardless of the hormone mix), so in that respect I feel it was kind of predictable. 

The chances of you having the exact same experience as me is probably slim, so I don't know if this actually will be of any use. However the implant is considered a low dose HBC, so I guess there's a chance that any side effects you do get will be less severe than what you have on Depo.

The most popular kids' cartoon right now is most likely *Adventure Time*. Interestingly enough that show was originally pitched to Nickelodeon, but they turned it down. Then the creator pitched it to Cartoon Network, they bought it, it exploded, and Nickelodeon is seething.

mr_bijae,dogs,1389318590.0,"I could write a book about it! I don't know if I can spend that much time here. The first thing to realize is you have bilateral communication with your dog even if you don't realize it. From there you build on that communication and find what works for your dog. Every dog is going to be different and have different triggers that work for them. Bear, my lab chow mix does not like sudden loud noises. I have had him for nine years and know his history. I tried the whistle once and it had the desired response so I rewarded him for it with a small treat. What dog doesn't like treats? I also gave him a lot of verbal praise and a good old fashioned rub down. Every time he responded this way I would praise him and give him a rub down. The others saw how this was playing out and decided they wanted in on the action. So every body got the same treatment for the first couple weeks. Next was the one on one testing. Black Jack, my youngest ignored the whistle when he was out on his own. So I tried other 'triggers'. I remembered that one time while we were jogging through the city he responded to my calling out ""PUP"" very loudly. So I tried that out on the beach. BINGO, he responded beautifully. Again I rewarded him with praise and rub downs and cookie. So he has his own sound that he responds to. 

As for getting them to understand the hand signals? Every time you incorporate the new audible command issue the same hand signal simultaneously. The key to training any animal to trust you is consistency in your training. My animals all know I'm fair with them and I don't ask them to do something that is harmful to them. I am consistent with my signals and audibles so they are clear about what is being asked of them. I am consistent in my positive reinforcement of their behavior. Today they don't get a cookie every time, but they get a lot of audible praise followed by some ""free time"" where we play together. 

You have a bilateral communication with your dog. They know your communication style, intonations and inflections. They know when you're serious just the way you know when your parents were serious when they were giving you commands. Use positive reinforcement with your training, be fair and consistent in your training. Use cues and behaviors that your animal exhibits naturally. And always show your affection and reward your animal with praise and petting. A scratch behind the ear, or a belly rub can quickly let your animal know you're very happy with them. Dogs want to please and will repeat a behavior if they know you're happy AND they get something cool out of it too. "

jubbergun,worldnews,1389318713.0,"Keeping this on the topic of gender and not trying to conflate this guy with being Hitler or the KKK, I'd have to ask why his request is such an affront.  Colleges in particular have many female ""safe spaces"" where they don't have to interact with men.  Denying this guy's request seems like a bit of a double-standard, even more so because he at least has a valid (whether you agree with it or not) religious reason for the separation."
panjandrumm,AskWomen,1389318714.0,"So are you suggesting that a rejection should be both polite and highly detailed of all the reasons for which the person being rejected is being rejected?  If I'm asking someone out, even if they say no, I neither want nor expect a detailed description of what I did wrong.  If I did, I'd ask for it (and honestly I have asked during a particularly amiable break up).  Similarly, if I wanted that particular woman to help me get over said rejection (and honestly that would probably be the worst person to ask), I would ask them directly.  I expect nothing from them.  I DO expect my friends and family to help and be supportive, but that is completely gender-independent.
On top of that, as others have said, women owe nothing to men as a whole, and no woman owes anything to anyone asking them out just because of the asking."

RsonW,AskWomen,1389318724.0,"The first thing asked of a man who gets beat up is still, ""what'd you do to deserve it?"" Workers in the US (almost all of whom at the time men) got shot and killed for daring to stand up for their human rights. In some other countries, this still occurs today. Patriarchy is a universal bad. Its root is ""Patria,"" ""father."" As in ""male leader,"" not ""all men.""

Feminism is about equality of the sexes because the previous system was bad for both (most) men and women. That's why its roots are in Marxism. Marx got it. Don't pretend that having a doctor say that the reason you stood up to your husband was because there's something medically wrong with you is a worse scenario than explaining to the whole town there's been a misunderstanding as the noose is tightened around your neck.

Both mindsets have consequences that bleed into the modern era. And neither of us live in the past. At present day, calling a man an asshole for standing up for himself and/or expressing his valid emotions is no worse than calling a woman crazy for doing the same thing."

pizzaandburritos,seduction,1389318766.0,"This is what I hear you saying: 
You were friends with her and she texts you about hanging out. For some reason you see that as an opportunity to get laid. You go full speed ahead with this and do the deed. Without more details, it's really hard to say whether your read her signals correctly. 

From her perspective, this is what she sees:
She's hanging out with this guy she's friends with when he suddenly kisses her. This probably shocked her but maybe she was ok with it if she was into you, too. Then in the heat of the moment you had sex. Now she doesn't understand where she stands with you. She doesn't understand that you basically calculated this, and she may think you have a big crush on her or something.

Let's face it, you knew that a side effect of f*cking someone you don't really like is that it will hurt her. So yeah, of course you don't want to talk to her because that means telling her she was the victim of throwaway sex. So there's probably some guilt at play here.  Also, no-strings-attached sex may not have commitment attached, but there is almost always some level of awkwardness attached about trying to figure out what she wants, what you want, blah blah blah. 

The other thing is when you say you weren't romantically interested in her, does that mean you don't find her attractive or just that you don't see her as relationship material? Because if you have sex with a girl just because you think she's into you, and not because you are into her at least on a physical level, you're gonna have a hard time with that once you're no longer thinking like a caveman just trying to get laid.

the_glass_gecko,AskWomen,1389318917.0,"In the relationship, I felt like, to borrow a term from [this great TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/leslie_morgan_steiner_why_domestic_violence_victims_don_t_leave.html), ""a strong woman helping a weak man"" or something like that.  I was the support for my brilliant but troubled entrepreneurial boyfriend.  I was strong for being able to handle his difficulties; no one else would be able to deal with him like I could.

Problems were caused, I think anyway, partially from his inability to handle stress, and partially from buried, undealt-with issues from his past.  The stress of starting a business is huge, and if you don't know how to manage that, you're destined to snap.

Once I realized what had been going on, I was of course first devastated.  In breaking up with him and seeking help and support, I felt great comfort in knowing how normal our circumstances were, and relief in knowing other women had gotten through it, and I could too.  I denied it for a long time.  When he had screamed at me or held my paycheck or vehicle use over my head, or broken my things, or when I had to lie to family and friends about his behavior, I just thought I was being a dutiful girlfriend protecting our relationship.

After he hit me, I didn't break up with him immediately, but we did separate immediately.  There were a few months of me hoping that therapy and being serious about his problems would lead to resolution.  It didn't.  So, I did prolong things, to no avail.  For reference: we had been together 3.5 years, and I gave him 2 months to try to fix things.

I felt great after things were over.  I still suffer from some PTSD because of it but I see so clearly what I had put up with and am so grateful to be out of it.  He reacted very poorly during the 2 month period of us trying to work things out - lots of ultimatums and pressure and awfulness.  I know I made the right choice and I am happy to talk about it with anyone who needs the help.  This all started in May of last year so it's been about 6 months since I ended things, and my life is so much better now, I'm so glad.

I'm still single but have casually seen some guys.  I am putting all my energy in to my self and my career and future and don't feel like I'm in a place to be able to give a relationship the attention and effort it deserves.  Because I was working and living with my partner, I literally had to start my life over - new job, new car, move back home, etc.  So, I got to start pursuing my dream career - working with horses.  I read autobiographies by women who had overcome struggle - that was so inspiring.  I devoured them.  Somaly Mam's ""The Road of Lost Innocence"" and Leymah Gbowee's ""Mighty be our Powers"", and ""Aman: The Story of a Somali Girl.""  I reached out to friends and family and told them everything - abuse is a problem largely due to silence and shame, and I refused to feel ashamed of what happened to me or to be quiet about it.  I saw a life coach for 3 months.  I honored my pain and gave myself lots of time and compassion and spoiling.  I let myself be helped.  I attended a local free support group for victims of domestic violence.  I am so proud of myself and so excited for my future.

But most importantly: what does it feel like?  It feels like you're walking on eggshells.  It feels like you can never do or say anything right, you can never please him.  It feels like you're afraid he's going to blow up anytime and you bend over backwards to keep him calm and happy, but it never works.  I could go on and on... best of luck and I'm here if you need to PM me!"

The means to do this involved sea-cocks and pumps which also had other purposes, so it was not a dedicated facility, but scuttling a ship by these means had long been known as a tactic to avoid an enemy coming into possession of a resource (hence the existence of the verb in English), and in some vessels this was part of the training - WW II U boats, for instance.

feedmahfish,askscience,1389319014.0,"Salmonids in general are a cold water fish.  That's how they have evolved and why you don't find trout in the south unless they are stocked in mountain streams (because they are usually quite frigid).  [Salmons in the arctic can withstand about 5 degrees and not be stressed to death](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f52-016?journalCode=jfrbc#.Us9S8rQhHFo).  However, they do reduce metabolic activities at really frigid temperatures, just like all other poikilotherms.

However what differentiates these fish from other fish is that they are physiologically equipped, adapted, and functioning at low temperatures.  Which means you can find really fast moving salmonids and trouts at really low temperatures.

How? All this took place before the project started. If the decision was that he would be excused (which, incidentally, it wasn't) then they would just say before ""oh he won't be taking part in the group work after all"".

&gt; it's going to force the rest of the group to do more work than every other group in the class

Have you ever been in a group-work situation where every group had *exactly* the same number of people? I haven't. There are almost always a few groups that have one person more or less than the average. 

Then you get people dropping out, people getting ill, people doing no work... frankly it's better to know from the start that someone won't be participating than to have them included initially and then leave."

I graduated a little over a year ago (November 2012! hurray!). I didn't go to my ceremony. I paid my own tuition. I got a job right as I finished school (August) but the ceremony itself wasn't until November. Because I was new, and hourly, none of my requests for days off in the first 6 months would be paid. I lived with my fiancé. I had bills to pay. I needed the money. 


I didn't want to go because I didn't enjoy my time at university. My mom berated me calling me selfish and that I was disappointing her and she didn't understand how I could be so selfish after everything she did to help with my university career (...she did...um...nothing? Oh wait, she let me live at home in my first 2 years, well forced, then kicked me out...). Anywho, since I didn't go to my ceremony and because I'm keeping my degree with me (it's hanging in my living room) she tells people that she doesn't know/think I finished university.


So, yea, fuck that, I'm NC--I don't need the bullshit. But just so you know, she probably wants to go because a part of her just doesn't believe you finished let alone graduated college."

Miss_Sarah_Fortune,AdviceAnimals,1389319043.0,"When I have a seizure (thankfully, I'm one year and nearly one month seizure free) I come out of it ready to fight. Be prepared for that. Shock, startled, panicked, grieving...and often violent. The person will be in extreme pain, very weak. Extremely disoriented, and you may have to tell the person multiple times that he or she had a seizure, as the brain may 'reboot' several times coming out of it, if that makes sense. Oftentimes the post-ictal (after seizure) stage lasts for hours, so you'll be fighting him or her about it for hours. 

Chances are, the person will have a mouth full of cuts all over the tongue and cheeks. It's absolutely miserable, but some pain medication and peroxide-based mouthwash will help with that pain a lot. Much preferable to hurting the person by putting something in the mouth. The person will be in a lot of pain in general. Try and get the person something for pain...and don't let them walk, by all means. 

If someone is having a seizure, put them in the recovery position and time the seizure. Call EMS. They will ask you, if you were able to time it, how long the seizure went on/has been going on.

Bannanahatman,Honda,1389319136.0,"Ok here it is.

B series is cast from 2 primary blocks with dozens of variations for different markets and vehicle's. The two are b16/17. And b18/20

The b18b (LS), b18a, b20b, and b20z are all the same motor and all lack vtec. B20a is not part of the b series family. The b20 is just bored out to 2 liters.There are also high and low compression versions of these engines. I am not sure, but have heard the b18a is a b18b but the engine is assembled in the US for the da integra. I haven't verified that though.

The b18c, b17, and the b16a are the vtec version. They are the same casting and internals can be swapped. The primary difference I've been told is deck height. The b16 is decked to bring the displacement down. The b16b is the type r b16 and has the same deck height as the b18c. So then its essentially a b16a with a longer stroke since the piston rods are longer.


&gt;b20b is the one to choose out of the set.

This is not 100% true though I've heard it before on forums. I have been told by many tune shops that the b18b is stronger than the b20 since the boring to 2.0 compromises the strength of the cylinder walls. Especially for boost the LS is highly revered.  Still an excellent motor. I had a b20b block with a b16a3 head and b16 transmission. That was a fun motor for sure.

More importantly, womanhood is rooted in the body.  You never doubt you are a woman because your body reminds you graphically every month.

Masculinity is different than femininity. Masculinity is rooted in adherence to a code of masculinity; a code rooted in stoicism, independence, competence; and is awarded to men by other men, by ""fathers"" and ""brothers.""  

The key to masculinity is that it can be given and taken away, that it must be defended and can be attacked.  Part of the concept of masculinity is that without masculinity, a man is just a failed woman.  He's a woman that can't have babies, and is useless. Displaying masculinity is what establishes you as a man in the eyes of other men, and worthy of respect.

That's why men can feel emasculated; it means they feel they are failing to perform masculinity correctly."

Strictly speaking you can't really multiply those numbers (80 x .05 = 4) to determine the probability of a particular outcome over a series of events.  If so, the odds of getting a tails with 2 coin tosses (.5 x 2 = 1) would be certain, which we know isn't the case.  It is actually 3 in 4.  It doesn't change the likelihood much though, coming in at about [3.8%](http://www.calcul.com/bernoulli-trials?nt=80&amp;ns=1&amp;ps=.0005&amp;op=Calculate).

Is Zelalem more likely than MLS players to succeed? Yes.

Is it because of being at Arsenal? No

Kenny Cooper and Jonathan Spector started out their careers with Man United, and their combined careers include one stand-out season in MLS, a mediocre spell with a relegated Prem team and being descent in the Championship.

Halader,Advice,1389319466.0,"Try to find one reason, any reason, for them to get help. Do they care about you? It would help them be better to you if they got professional help. You would be better off if your spouse went to a therapist. Do they want to change at all? Do they want to have a better life? If they don't care at all, either way, then they will hopefully be willing to do it for you, if not for him/herself.

Some counselors aren't a right fit for some people. That's perfectly normal and not at all uncommon. It's important to keep trying though. As for the legal issues, you have to determine what's more important for them. Protecting people who hurt them and not getting help, or getting help. Also, they don't have to say anything they don't want to. So, if they were abused, they don't have to say who abused them. I think it would be good to do so, but if they do not want anyone else to know exactly who it was (or who did whatever), then they are under no obligation to disclose information that they don't want to."

I mean, even looking at popular TV programs, you'll find what my cousin likes to call ""Power Porn for women"", like **Mad Men**, **Two and a Half Men** and **Everybody Loves Raymond** ie. men living the ideal male lifestyle by the ideal male moral ethic being shamed, ridiculed, or portrayed as sad, pathetic characters who don't understand that the masculinity is inferior to femininity. 

Furthermore, most men, in reality really do not meet the standard of masculinity by which you earn the title ""man"". Unless you consider a ""man"", a human born with a penis, and nothing more, which is, quite frankly, insulting, most men simply aren't actually ""men"", but boys.

Dantilli,socialskills,1389319825.0,"I have to say, well done. Well done for analysing, diagnosing and acting towards fixing this. It is a ridiculously common problem to which I have very recently overcome myself.

I first want to say, Models is a pretty good book. Read it. It'll provide even more motivation for expressing the true you and gives good, dating oriented advice that you're not likely to get here.

So, you know your problem is you're Mr. Rogers all the time, maybe to avoid conflict, maybe because you are worried if people will like the true you, maybe because you know **some people will not like the true you**. The biggest change for me was realising that not everyone is going to like me, and being ok with it. I bet there are some people you don't particularly like, right? but you don't go out of your way to attack them, you just avoid them. Everyone else does the same, so there is no need to be scared of people not liking you.

I once read/watched something about the concept of polarising. Basically meaning that the more expressive you are, the quicker people realise whether they will get on with you or not. Being Mr. Rogers is just expressing yourself as little as possible so that other that people never actually make up their minds. That way you never make a bad impression... but you also never make a good impression. So instead of Mr. Rogers making a good impression, he makes none at all. Remember this is only in a casual social setting, in a business setting you'll probably make quite a good impression because that's just how that world operates. But you already know that.

Now, you probably realise there isn't going to be a ""magic pill"" kind of fix for this, it's going to take time and effort. You're probably good at noticing when you're anxious in a social situation and you know how to ""avoid"" it (becoming Mr. Rogers). What you need to do, when you realise you have that anxiety, is say the thing that would make it worse, you wanna push straight into it. Whenever you have a thought and you get anxious and you worry whether they'll like it or whether it's appropriate, just say it, actively seek out anxiousness and force yourself through it. Did you ever experience anxiety when approaching people when you were younger? this is the same, just push through it.

Now, i'm not suggesting you try this all the time or even with people you know at first, i'd actually recommend going somewhere where you don't know anybody and trying it out. Maybe go to a bar for an hour or two and just try talking to people as YOU instead of Mr. Rogers. It might be hard, you'll probably make a fool of yourslf a few times, but who cares? these are people you do not know who you'll probably never meet again so there are no consequences. Repeat this regularly, maybe a couple of times a week and see what happens. Don't put any pressure on yourself, just go and have fun. 

The top tip for this would be, say the first thing that comes into your head at all times during this hour. NO MATTER WHAT IT IS.

&gt; When I do make a friend, I try to keep them as long as possible no matter what, because I have trouble making new friends

Now, do you see what is wrong with this statement? being Mr. Rogers doesn't prolong your friendship, it keeps you in the ""no impression zone"" for as long as possible. So yes, they may hang around you longer because they want to get to know you and as you give very little away, they stay a bit longer. Hence it takes you so long to actually become friends with someone. But if you express yourself from the start, they'll become your friend much sooner.

One last thing, I'd recommend reading [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/1451639619/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389077749&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=7+habits+of+highly+effective+people) this covers a lot of these subjects and I learned a lot of the ideas I've talked about from this book and SO many more. It's also pretty old and has been reprinted many, many times so you'll probably find it in a library if you don't want to buy it. Also try How to Win Friends and Influence People (link on the sidebar), It's no-where near as manipulative as it sounds, it's just kind of a manual on how to express yourself while still treating the other person with respect (not the best desription but... meh, try reading it, it's fairly short). This is also pretty old so check your local library for it too.

DAMN this is a long post, even for me... It's not very well written, but hopefully it helps in some way.

TL;DR: try expressing the true you for short bursts in situations where there are no people around that you know e.g. a bar. Read Models, [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/1451639619/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389077749&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=7+habits+of+highly+effective+people) and How to Win Friends and Influence People (link on sidebar), they helped me quite a bit with this exact problem."

So this, by far, is not my favorite album, but Plans by Death Cab is a really weird album to me that has always evoked a lot of emotion.  I don't know why.  I don't think it's particularly good.  Not to sound like *that guy* but I like their stuff before Plans better.  But when I first had a copy of it, circa 2005, after listening to it just a couple of times I felt so deeply depressed that I didn't just take it out of my CD player; I broke it into pieces and threw it away (it was a burned copy).  Months later, something drew me to it again so I got another copy.  Within a couple of weeks, I had broken up that copy and thrown it away too.  It made me feel like I wanted to kill myself, and I still have no idea why.  Now, I can listen to it and feel nostalgic about 2005-2006, and while it doesn't make me depressed, it makes me *feel* that time period like I'm really living it.  Kooky. "

backfromretirement,TumblrInAction,1389319890.0,"But that's just it, this movie had its romance but it didn't matter to how awesome the characters were. My favorite part was that we see Anna learn what romantic love really is but when she thinks that the true love's kiss will save her, she saves HERSELF by proving her love for her sister, rather than being rescued by her man. That's fucking badass. And then at the end they get to be cute and romantic but only as a side note and only after she makes sure her sister is ok. Family and sisterhood first, adorable romance second, and I think it added so much to Anna's growth to have her truly fall in love with someone who wasn't perfect but perfect for her. Disney gave us Merida in Brave not too long ago who didn't get a romance at all and her whole growth was about taking responsibility for herself and her family. That was beautiful and perfect for that character and that message, a romance would have been forced. I don't think the romance in Frozen was forced at all. "

If you're uninsured, and willing to sign a document stating that you won't attempt to file the bill with any insurance provider, you can get up to 90% knocked off the bill.

Petunia_JAK,TTC30,1389319990.0,"With all due respect to missus_b, my doctor has said everything opposite that hers apparently did. If you and your doctor suspect low progesterone, a series of blood tests post-ovulation should be done at 5,7,and 9 dpo (some only do the test 7dpo) to find your peak progesterone. A level lower than 10ng/ml is too low to support a pregnancy and suggests a problem with the corpus luteum or that a ""weak"" ovulation has occurred. 

Clomid is often prescribed with this problem, but I am confused as to why an RE would say it will work the first cycle or not at all. That's completely ridiculous. Even in couples with no fertility issues conception only occurs in a maximum of 33% of cycles where intercourse is timed perfectly. Even in IVF where sperm and eggs are placed together 100% of eggs do not fertilize. A minimum of a 3 month trial should be done on clomid to gauge its effectiveness. 

A suppository WILL lengthen your LP, but if your ovulation is weak (the problem for the majority of women with low progesterone or a luteal phase defect) it won't help at all, a drug such as Clomid or similar will still be necessary. 

For this reason, most women with low progesterone will be on a combined treatment of Clomid and progesterone suppositories. 

As others have said though, your LP length is not indicative of low progesterone, though some women do have a normal LP length but experience spotting. If it is only this one cycle, you could have happened to have a weak ovulation this one cycle, which is normal. If it happens repeatedly, that you have 5 or more days of spotting even with a normal LP length I would see a doctor. "

denno87,askgaybros,1389320026.0,"I was one of those late bloomers. I remember I befriended a gay couple some months ago and one of them commented that he was going through my Facebook pictures and he noticed that within a period of a few months back when I was in college (like five years ago) I completely changed my looks and started to look A LOT better. Besides thinking to myself ""I used to look bad?"" I think the lesson here is that it really helps out when one changes their habits, their appearance and how they project themselves. 

I am not the model of what most of the gay community goes for. So I understand what you mean when you say you have to find a subsection of a subsection of a subsection of the gay male population to find a suitable partner. But if that's what you have to do that's what you have to do. And I meet EVERYONE. Worse thing that can happen is that they turn their nose up at me (much like how they're doing to you). But think about it, would you have wanted their admiration anyway? I take pride in having a group of friends that do not necessarily do that. 

The world may seem small but I think one of the powers you have as an adult is that you can choose what your world consists of (within reason). 

So my advice is work on yourself. Surround yourself with like minded people, be a better person, care about your appearance AND put yourself out there. Rejection is part of the game. 

I always believed that you cannot control how other people act but you can control how you respond. Forget about the haters. Love the lovers. 

Lastly, I ASSURE you that someone will find you sexy. I've seen gay couples in all types of shapes and sizes. Sometimes I'm surprised, sometimes I'm not. Just. Keep. Trying. If it were easy would it be worth it?"

Only thing I disagree with you on is here:

&gt;The task for every man is to define masculinity for himself.

I don't think that works, because that's what we're being asked to do now, and it's clearly not working.  Men need to be validated by other men, which is why men need to have relationships with other men, and with father figures.  To get external validation.  Men who rely entirely on self-validation tend to either spiral down into depression (because they doubt themselves and thus doubt their self-generated validation), or they rocket off into egomania because they *never* doubt themselves.

Men really need a men's movement that isn't rooted in anger and bitterness at women (ahem, MRAs, looking at you) is about returning to a culture where men are able to validate each other.  Masculinity used to be rooted in the institutions of society, but women have entered all those realms (to be clear: not a bad thing!) and men no longer find validation in them -- except in so much as they are able to exclude women, which is bad when you're talking about career fields.

Sometimes i think what we need is something like Boy Scouts, except it's like the Man Club.  You get inducted when you're 13, and earn merit badges, rise through the ranks, and stay involved forever.  Unless you're a fuck-up.  Then you get kicked out.  And all the members can have an actual Man Card, and when we're feeling emasculated and doubting our manhood we can pull out our Man Card and say ""Well, nobody has kicked me out of the club, so I'm still a man."""

I have always been honest about these things when asked. So has every other woman that I know.  I don't see why you would think that they are all lying about their stated preferences.

&gt; Also more to emphasise that just because someone doesn't find you attractive doesn't mean that they think you're a bad person. Particularly within friendship groups, women need to be able to say to their male friends (who may be in the friendzone) that they don't find them attractive and exactly why;

I have never heard anyone claim that someone was a bad person because they found them unattractive. If someone did that, they would be ridiculous. If someone is in the ""friend zone"" they can either choose to be *friends* or can choose to leave. It is a self-imposed state. If my friends asked me why I wasn't attracted to them, I would tell them, but,  again,  it serves no purpose.

It was also pretty much for college kids to hook up and party or bang or whatever. 

Then they started letting highschoolers get in on it. Then anyone could get in on it. Facebook has changed a lot, I still have an account, but I make myself stay off of it. Such a time drain. FFS, my Mom is on Facebook now. She likes and comments on everything I post or am tagged in.

There's an episode...I think it's season 3, where Mitchell and Claire start turning Gloria into ""new mom"", and Gloria mentions that's really weird since she's younger than Claire by fourteen months. This puts Gloria at ~41.

Jay was stated to be 63 in season 1, so now he's ~67.

Cameron turned 40 in season 3, so he's 42 by now.

The kids' ages can be deduced from their current education level as another poster mentioned.

The children do not fully grasp English, nor do they understand what it sounds like.

They made me say a bunch of really fucked up shits to the parents to get reactions out of them, that they then cut in with the more PC jokes that ended up making it into the final show.

Anyways, by mid-2010, I had accumulated nearly 15,000 bitcoins. I sold a bunch junior year (2011) when they were just above $1.

If I recall correctly, I should have 9 wallets, backed up on my 500GB hdd. I was able to find 4 of my wallets and cash in nearly 15 bitcoins. However, my main wallet, which was the wallet in which all my coins mined from my main rig go to, is encrypted. It has nearly 100 Bitcoins in it. I have always used the same password, with slight variations (first letter capitalized and so on).

I expect the other 4 wallets to contain another 25-50 BTC. Only question is where the hell are they...

Not to mention the hotel was dingy despite being one of the most expensive and ""luxurious"" in my town. 

Property Managers and owners spent over a million dollars renovating the damned placed and it was of such shoddy quality. Most of the budget was drained into a new dining room (what a waste) so corners were cut when it came to renovating the rooms. 

Some rooms just to give them a more livable space (the building was an inn built in the 30's, so rooms were cramped) they just did away with the bathrooms. But what to do when a room doesn't have a bathroom?

It's called xtreme-wheels, it's on 356 Hertel Ave, this is their site:

www.xtreme-wheels.com

I just went there about a week ago, they have 3 street courses, one is pretty basic, just a bank ramp and some movable objects.  The course next to it has some kickers going from a large deck, with a 3 or 4 stair in the middle (I forgot, I didn't skate that course really, I stayed on the beginner course), a funbox, and then a quarterpipe on the wall.  Then there is a bigger course, the main street course in the back, with a huge bank ramp with a euro gap and some hubbas, a pyramid, and some transition on the other side.

There is also a big halfpipe in the middle of the park, and a mini-ramp behind it.

Here is a tour Woodward did of the park: 
www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3kzeWOlCv0

It's privately owned, so you have to pay for sessions, but it's worth it, I stayed for around 3 hours last time.  Membership is 9$ for a year, and they will let you just pay for a session (8$ or 5$ after certain time on certain days or 5$ for certain sport, skateboard is tuesdays) if you want to check the park out before getting membership.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not into this whole ""I'm oppressed blah blah blah crap."" I'm not oppressed and I know it. However, how the fucking hell are Jews more privileged than other religions. We don't even make up 1% of the world population. Growing up being the only Jewish person in my area was weird. Every year I had to sing about Jesus Christ during Christmas. In middle school if I mentioned going to a Jewish sleep away camp there was a 50/50 chance someone would make a holocaust joke (and what makes it worse is that during that time I had just learned half of my great grandmas family died in the holocaust). It wasn't the end of the world and I didn't care so much, but really? I'm so damn privileged with my Jew powers.

existie,Portland,1389320691.0,"I agree with you that this is an incredibly poor use of funds; mostly due to the per-user charge. Not only do books (especially hardcovers) sturdy, but they're cheap compared to a lot of media, at least at retail value. A hardcover is what, $25 on the high end? Compared to a standard $35-60 per season of TV shows, which need to be replaced as the DVDs are lost/damaged. Per-user cost on things like streaming, depending on how many actually use the service, will probably add up to this easily.

On the other side, with the disappearance of walk-in rental stores, having movies/TV shows available from libraries offers an alternative to piracy. Perhaps you want to see a TV/movie classic (or video for a book) - since you can't easily rent it and can't find/afford to purchase it, you can get it from the library. Bonus points for foreign films, which are arguably valuable for simply exposing you to another culture's art, since at least Washington county's library system has a good interlibrary loan.

If I was to go back for a week by myself, I'd say to bring (not including hotel) $300-400 so I wouldn't worry about money. It would be plenty. Have fun!"

pizzaandburritos,seduction,1389320868.0,"If you just want casual sex, go get it, but don't expect emotional connection. FWB is a gray zone and I don't know anyone who has sustained a FWB relationship longer than a few months, much less one that was fulfilling. It usually becomes something of a train wreck. When you do friend stuff like hang out together or talk, it really causes a lot of confusion. So if sex is all you care about, avoid that stuff. There are girls out there who will be your booty call. Just be clear about it. Don't try to be 'nice' by getting them dinner or anything like that because it will lead them on.

The problem for me lies in that you say you are ""looking for somewhat of an emotional as well as physical connection"". You can't expect to be able to emotionally connect with a girl and then also recoil when she shows feelings for you. Now maybe by ""emotional connection"" all you mean is that you don't want to bang some hoe you have no respect for. If that's the case, I think you're using the wrong term. But if you mean that you want to have some level of affection towards each other, but not enough to settle down with each other, then I think you need to think of this as dating and not a FWB situation. 

""Casual dating"" to me means starting to build an understanding of each other as people, hanging out, making out, having sex, but not being exclusive/declaring love/getting too involved in each other's lives. Casual sex to me means having sex, maybe some chit chat before and after but not trying to build companionship. 

Terms like ""friends with benefits"", ""casual sex"", ""lover"", ""boyfriend"" mean different things to different people. Be concrete when you tell women what you want. What would your ideal relationship look like? When you say you don't really want to be in a LTR, is it that you don't want to hang out with a girl more than x times/month? Is it that you don't want to be sexually exclusive? Is it that you like her for her looks but really don't care about what's going on in her life?

I've seen SRSers say misandry isn't real, just like black people can't be racist against white people. Some people who identify themselves as feminists have victim/persecution complex so deeply embedded in their personalities that almost everything that comes out of their mouths is vitriolic toward anyone who doesn't share a demographic with poor, oppressed little them.

I have a friend who is totally awesome and reasonable and devoutly identifies herself as a feminist. She has explained to me what feminism is *supposed* to mean. To me, it sounds a lot like applying an unnecessary title to common decency, and bringing along all the negativity associated with it. But I respect feminists who aren't extremists the same way I respect Christians who aren't extremists: we probably have a lot of overlap in our beliefs. I just think my version cuts a lot of unnecessary complication out of the equation."

banana-tree,Turkey,1389321205.0,"&gt;Why the hell would you group together secular countries ( i.e countries that are not governed by Sharia law therefore not "" Muslim countries "" ) and countries that are governed by Sharia law that mandate women to cover up and put them all under an umbrella of "" Muslim countries?

To see if and how they differ, maybe? Why not?

&gt;no one is going to tell you what the hell to wear or badger you for wearing it.

Occasionally they will, but regardless, this particular question asks people which one they think is the most appropriate, not what they would do if they saw someone dress 'inappropriately' or whether they really care (so it forces a choice). There are other questions in the survey ([here's a link to it](http://mevs.org/files/tmp/Tunisia_FinalReport.pdf), the comparisons start at page 48) and turns out 52% of the Turkish respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement ""it is up to the women to dress as she wishes"". 

That's higher than those who think #6 is the most appropriate public appearance, but then again, about half of the respondents disagreed (or were undecided) with that statement, which is more troubling than the results shown in this particular graphic IMHO. Those who think women don't/shouldn't get the sole say in what they get to wear may be thinking of the family and/or society (so not necessarily law and the government) as forces that get an additional say in the matter, so my concern isn't sharia but a more general one.

&gt;Just because we have Erdogans religious extremist regime in play doesn't mean we are ruled by Sharia law. People need to get off this trip of "" Turkey is becoming the new Iraq""

I don't see anyone claiming any such thing here, at least in reference to this research. If anything, these results show Turkey has a more secular population compared to most other Muslim-majority countries of the region, not a trend indicative of ""becoming the new Iraq"". I wouldn't call Erdoğan's rule ""religious extremist"" either.

edit: I said Iraq wasn't ruled by sharia, but I stand corrected. Their constitution does say no law can be made that goes against Islam. Sharia comes in many flavours though and Iraq's definitely isn't as strict and hardcore as, say, Saudi Arabia's. I don't think wearing the headscarf is mandatory either, but didn't check that specifically."

panjandrumm,worldbuilding,1389321305.0,"&gt;In my world, there's an intangible mesh of magic potency, strands, that intersects with the real world.

This is basically exactly the same as the magic in the world I've been working on, only the nodes where the thickest strands intersect are motile, and can be manipulated to form semi-permanent magic effects. It is unclear whether these nodes have anything to do with whether or not people are gifted with magical abilities.

To answer the OP, magic is a kind of forgotten art.  While not everyone can use magic, most people can, it just stays latent until they learn how through instruction by others who can.  Magic latent capability can manifest itself in many non-magical ways as natural skill in a way related to the type of magic (e.g. trained enchanters can magically change peoples' minds and opinions or convince them of anything, but untrained ""muggles"" with latent enchanter ability become politicians or captains of the debate team)."

I appreciate character development as much as the next person, but it was still a bit frustrating. I think I'd be less frustrated if I started watching with Season 2.

It's probably my general disillusionment with the show that dampened it for me though, less the actual style shift. And the sheer cruelty of Sherlock in the final moments of the episode, when he's supposed to be having a sincere moment with John, and it turns out he was manipulating him even then, which left a very bitter taste for the whole episode for me.

I was fitted as a 32 via measuring tape and eyed as a B. She said a 32 would be more supportive than what I was currently wearing (a 34 band, which she also eyed). I did mention that I preferred 30 bands (I tried on a couple before enlisting her help). She said that I could go either or because my underbust was 29, but that the 30 would be snugger, and that she suggested the 32 bands because they have more options in that size. I dunno if she was trying to save herself from what she said previously or if that is really why she suggested the 32 band. I might be a pessimist to even think the former, because she was perfectly nice!

She brought me some bras in the 32B, one I bust out of and a Natori feathers that worked though the band felt large. She was surprised to find out that I bust out of the one bra, but it was the holiday season so I didn't ask her for more help (poor girls were SO busy trying to help men buy lingerie hehe). I ended up leaving with a 30C Calvin Klein bra that fit perfectly well minus a bit of quadboob, but the 30D was shape incompatible."

No. Seriously. It happens all the time.

Someone comes in with some off-the-wall concept and writes a self-post. Eventually, I come along and read it.

&gt;&gt; How can wisdom free of concepts be limited by concepts?

&gt;It cant, but that doesnt mean that one is automatically the master of all concepts. In fact, it is impossible for him to be the master of all concepts, since there are infinite possible concepts but a finite number of mind-moments in a persons life.

He defied that finity when he attained Nirvana. This is what perfect wisdom means.

&gt;Did the buddha know how to build a nuclear power plant? At what stage of meditation does that kind of understanding spontaneously arise in one's mind?

Did they need to know about how to build a nuclear power plant before the first century? Did they have the capacity? Was there anything to use that power? Would that knowledge have liberated them? No no no &amp; no.

Not in the slightest.  Broadly, satire is commenting on a position by pretending to assume it.  But sure, as you plummet towards the lowest common denominator it tends towards just turning into ridicule and trying to [wind people up](http://i.imgur.com/aaODnol.jpg).

What I mean is, there's pointing out flaws in an argument for the purposes of maybe getting to people who don't actually know what's going on but keep hearing all this shit from anti-vax people, and then there's putting on a hat that says ""Anti-Vax"" and licking a turd while saying ""LOL I'M AN ANTI-VAX MAN"".

potato1,changemyview,1389321504.0,"The language ""Americans are throwing out..."" was used colloquially. If you look further into the report, you'll note that they identify losses at each step in the supply and logistics chain. Page 6 has a summary of losses at each step. Only stage 5, Consumer Losses, has anything to do with consumer behavior. Those losses do count for more than the other causes of losses, which is why the reasoning that consumer choices are significant is probably correct, but I think that's immaterial, since other losses are significant enough anyways.

Your question about whether the wasted food is nutritious is addressed partially by the report. If you look at page 6, the largest segment of fruit and vegetable waste is consumer behavior, at 28%.

&gt;Alright, but in the context of the overarching topic of comparing universal health insurance to universal food insurance (eg, welfare) there would be no relevance in defending positions unrelated to wealth redistribution.

I never intended to defend universal food welfare. The purpose of my original comment, as I've explained elsewhere, was to create cognitive dissonance for OP by relating food, housing, and other necessities to health care. I don't agree with OP's view that universal single-payer healthcare that also eliminates the private sector is the only moral solution for health care, and I don't agree that universal food and housing welfare are the only moral solutions for homelessness and hunger."

You know what, if Taoism doesn't work for someone, then it doesn't work for them and they should find something that does.  The Tao is as close an idea as I can come to the most absolutely real truths I've ever realized within myself, so for me, it works, but there are clearly some people who are simply not oriented towards having things explained the same way, and that's fine, they should find what works for them.

The argument they posit is a particularly weak one, though, and obviously one that doesn't come from anything more than a cursory, surface-deep glance at Taoism.  If they're not into it then that's fine, and if they're interested in learning more, that's fine too, but come on.  ""You are not water, you are a person!""  Really?  That's your argument, that we aren't literally water?  In fact a good percentage of our bodies *is* literally water, so even from a literal standpoint, that doesn't make a lot of sense, but taking the metaphor of water as an example of the flow of the Tao literally reveals that whoever this is needs to give the Tao Te Ching a less cursory reading."

That is a really big step, and is important. You get to define what standards you want to measure success and human worth.

You can believe in yourself without considering yourself superior. The fact that you are ranking yourself shows you have some work to do. I do as well; it is natural for us to rank ourselves. It is a greater sign of maturity not to worry about who is superior or inferior.

Keep in mind that any individuals that are removed from the wild shrink the gene pool for the surviving wild population, making it even harder for them to survive. 

Some breed veeeeery slowly, or have high failure rates for offspring (such as some tortoises). 

Some have specific social situations needed for reproduction, like the now-extinct carrier pigeons. Carrier pigeons flocked in large enough quantities to darken the sky, and couldn't be made to mate and raise eggs/chicks once there weren't enough of them to make these massive bird colonies. "
sockalicious,personalfinance,1389321791.0,"You're in pretty bad financial shape.  It's going to take you decades to bail yourself out.  Let's take on the easy stuff first:

1)  Bankruptcy doesn't discharge student loan debt.  Forget about it.

2)  ""the gaming / film industry has started seeing corruption in outsourcing majority of their jobs across seas""

No.  You are upset enough that you are having trouble thinking straight.  This isn't right.  The gaming/film industry can do whatever it wants.  You're in no position to critique it.  You should not blame others for the predicament you are in; you should not waste time assigning blame at all.

3)  ""My parents Co-Signed most of my way through these loans.""  "" My parents once again came and saved the day and made a generous donation to them.""

No.  Horseshit.  This debt is your parents' debt too.  They have done nothing generous by either cosigning on these loans or by helping pay them. 

As far as helping pay, your parents agreed to do so when they cosigned; you should be *angry* with them because they allowed them to go into default.  By cosigning on them they agreed not to let that happen.

As far as cosigning these loans, they didn't do you or themselves any favors.  You could be legitimately angry with them for their lack of wisdom - I kind of am, they fucked you and fucked themselves - but that won't get you anywhere.

3)  Yep, the car's too costly.  Dump it at your first opportunity.  Take public transit, use your dad's car again, carpool, have your dad drop you off, and/or learn to walk.  Walking is dirt cheap.

4)  You do need health insurance.  As soon as you get it, avail yourself of mental health care.  You are having thought distortions.  You should not be contemplating suicide over this; it is only money, not that big a deal.  Your life is far from over.

5)  You are going to need to make more money.  Your two jobs aren't cutting it.  Can you be resourceful or ingenious; can you lie, cheat or steal your way into a better-paying job; can you wrangle Chinese or Indian 3D artists or animators as a contractor; can you do anything at all that might get you more money?  Always be thinking about this.

6)  In the end, the loans your parents cosigned aren't your problem.  They're your parents' problem.  They cosigned on most of these loans, you say; if I were you, I would devote all my efforts to worrying about the other loans, the ones your parents *didn't* take a blood oath to pay.  Let their own sense of self-interest come to your aid.

7)  There's always a way out if you can be resourceful, ingenious, charismatic, beautiful, or delightful.  You could form a company, invent a new and cost-effective way of making 3D art, subvert a bank official into altering your loan records, sell $1 million worth of drugs, or marry money.  Don't sell yourself short; your life isn't over."

basically `[;\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-s};]` can be shown to converge for s&gt;1. for example, `[;\zeta(2)=\frac{\pi^2}{6};]`.

then basically you just plug in s=-1, and assume it converges, and you get the result 1+2+3+...=-1/12 the same way you would for s&gt;1. so you aren't taking the limit of the sequence of partial sums, because that diverges. so basically you're treating the infinite series in a different way."

B) On the other hand, gout sounds like a disability, depending on how long it lasts for.  What's your copay on a checkup that makes getting a physical and a doctor's note more expensive than paying for a year of a gym? 

C) I looked it up myself, because you apparently could not be bothered to.  Law is here, it looks like.  http://www.cga.ct.gov/2011/pub/chap420.htm

You need to consult with a CT lawyer before doing anything, because I did not confirm this is the accurate or current version of the statute, and I don't know anything about CT law.

That said, the definition of disabled appears to be, like I expected, incredibly broad: ""(6) 'Disabled' and 'disability' mean a condition which has existed or will exist for more than forty-five days which prevents a buyer from utilizing the health club to the same extent he utilized it before commencement of such condition.""

So when you say ""or at least disabled to the term of the contract,"", I have two responses:  (a), that's nonsensical gibberish, (b), assuming you mean ""disabled _for_ the term of the contract"", that's just not true - you don't need to be permanently disabled and you don't need to be disabled for the life of the contract.

I wouldn't go in circles with you about this, but there's always the chance somebody searches for this thread six months from now and I don't want them to think they have fewer rights than they do.

sacapunta,AskWomen,1389322080.0,"I'll offer another perspective.  I am currently dating my boss.  It started out as harmless flirting, then got a little more intense.  Then one day he brought me tea at 3am when I was really sick and it all went from there.  So, I think it worked out well because I was 100% positive he liked me as well.

We told HIS boss once we realized it was something serious and it's been smooth sailing now for about 8 months.  I'm not saying this is for everyone, but it's worked for us.  I enjoy being able to see him at work, but I also realize that he is in a position of authority over me at work and I respect that.  If I fuck up, he tells me...probably more harshly than most of my coworkers.  

However, when I go home, work is over.  He is my boyfriend, and I love him.  We never bring home into work and visa versa.

jubbergun,worldnews,1389322130.0,"&gt; Do you absolutely believe that we did not live in a patriarchal society?

No, we don't.  We can't forget property and classism because not all men had the right to vote exactly because of property and classism.  [The majority of men only received the right \(in the US during a period between 1812 and 1860\) to vote a short period of time before all women did (1920).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_rights_in_the_United_States)  

Neither have men been ""hoarding rights.""  Every so-called 'privilege' men have/had (depending on your view) in society were attended by a host of obligations.  Those obligations are never examined by those who discuss male ""privilege,"" and those people also either never examine the ""privilege"" of females or dismiss that ""privilege"" as ""benevolent sexism (apparently, even when women do have an advantage, it's only because men are pigs), only focusing on the obligations that attend the advantages female have in society.

That is the biggest problem with the concept of ""privilege,"" and the ""patriarchy"" conspiracy theory nonsense with which it comes packaged.  ""Privilege"" is generally applied in such a way as to highlight one group's advantages but ignore its disadvantages while doing the inverse for any contrasting groups. It's not about examining social dynamics and finding solutions to any type of problem. The concept of privilege exists solely to scapegoat, silence, and marginalize.

[The $.77 pay gap theory has been debunked numerous times](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/08/gender_pay_gap_the_familiar_line_that_women_make_77_cents_to_every_man_s.html), but much like any other [Big Lie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Lie) campaign the misinformation dies a slow death.

alannathelioness,AskWomen,1389322188.0,"I would encourage any guy who thinks he is too ""unattractive"" to date anyone to look at a couple things:

Think about the type of women you are asking out. Are you going for girls who *you know* are more attractive than you? If your main concern with dating is looks this might be a problem. If you're going to be shallow about it, you need to take a good look at yourself and determine how attractive you are. Or have a female friend help with this. I don't see how guys who are trying to date soley based on looks can have a double standard. If you are being shallow, every girl you try to date is entitled too as well.

Is there anything you can do to improve your appearance? Lose weight? Haircut? Dress better? 

Also, it seems like you are implying that women do not have this problem. There are plenty of unattractive women who can't get dates as well. Should they be resenting the opposite gender for this? Just because I can't date Ryan Gosling doesn't mean I'm bitter. After all, women DO outnumber men on this planet so in theory, men should be the ones less left out in the dating world."

Most I've seen him eat was about 20 packets in one go - his normal diet is 2 packets a day (dried food is always available - which he eats as a last resort).

Funniest thing I ever saw was the day he ran into the living room full pelt, started running in circles, belly on the floor, then bolted to the water bowl and buried his face in it. Turns out he tried to lick soup of the side of the pan (we left it to cool before putting it in the fridge)."

I don't preach anti-masturbation like many on the sub, IMO it's more about anti-porn. I cannot speak for /r/pornfree since I've never even been there.

Look, a lot of you will disagree with me on this, but porn *is* bad, and /r/nofap has helped me realize this and eliminate it from my life. People like to say this about Facebook: ""If it's free, then *you're* the product"" Well the same can be said about porn. Porn isn't made for women or for couples. Porn is made primarily for lonely men sitting by themselves in a dark room jacking off. It's an industry that exploits the male sex drive."

If Overstock is smart enough to make this move, then they should realize that other online retailers will soon follow.  From there, it is only matter of time before a big retailer starts hording BTC, and then we'll see some real fireworks on price movement.

Quellious,Jokes,1389322494.0,"I'm not someone who is personally taking offense to the joke. I don't really know how to feel about it. However I figured I would explain other people's feelings to you here.

The fact that it is a joke to you is *exactly why* it is offensive. So when people are offended by some particular topic and the jokester says ""C'mon. *It's just a joke!*"", that actually is no real excuse and pretty meaningless. It is exactly the fact that a subject which makes some people uncomfortable or upset is being made into something non-serious or even hilarious that is the problem. At least *part* of the problem. 

This doesn't mean jokes that offend some people shouldn't be allowed to be told of course. It just means that you are insensitive to that subject and other people *are* sensitive to it. Typically if you are insensitive to the feelings of others on some occasions you probably shouldn't be surprised if people call you out on it. I'm not calling you out on it in this case. I'm just pointing out to you that you should expect such reactions when it comes to delicate subjects and that the phrase *It's just a joke* does nothing for those offended.

I hope this helps explain things!"

pjwork,learnmath,1389322500.0,"&gt; I'm having a difficult time understanding these concepts:

Ok, let's take them one at a time, but is a slightly different order. I'm going to assume this is for discreet probability, since Pr(X&lt;=a) is equivalent to Pr(X&lt;a) for continuous probabilities, and we'll assume X to be some random variable and a to be constant.

&gt;Pr(X=a)

This means we simply want to know what is the probability that X, our random variable, is equal to a.  Don't over complicate it.  Here's an example:

* **Question:** You are given the set of numbers {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, let X be the random variable defined as ""the set element is divisible by a"".  What is the probability that, choosing a random set element, it is divisible by 2?
* **Answer:** We want to find the probability that X equals a, or Pr(X=a), where a=2.  So we evaluate Pr(X=2) by finding the elements divisible by 2, which are {2,4,6,8,10} for a total of 5 elements, and dividing by the total number of elements 10, this Pr(X=2) = 5/10 = 1/2.

&gt;Pr(X&gt;=a)

This means we want the probability that X is any value greater than or equal to a, so you can rewrite this as, assuming each event is independent, as Pr(X&gt;=a) = Pr(X=a) + Pr(X=a+1) + Pr(X=a+2) ...

&gt;Pr(X&gt;a)

This means we want the probability that X is any value greater than  a, so you can rewrite this as, assuming each event is independent, as Pr(X&gt;=a) = Pr(X=a+1) + Pr(X=a+2) ...

Notice that for the &gt; case, the Pr(X=a) term is missing because we want cases were X is greater, but not equal, to a.  Also note that both cases will continue until you ""reach the end"" of X's range, which can mean you would have to sum together a potentially huge number of terms.

&gt;Pr(X&lt;=a)

This means we want the probability that X is any value less than or equal to a, so you can rewrite this as, assuming each event is independent, as Pr(X&lt;=a) = Pr(X=0) + Pr(X=1) + Pr(X=2) + ... + Pr(X=a-1) + Pr(X=a)

&gt;Pr(X&lt;a)

This means we want the probability that X is any value less than or equal to a, so you can rewrite this as, assuming each event is independent, as Pr(X&lt;=a) = Pr(X=0) + Pr(X=1) + Pr(X=2) + ... + Pr(X=a-1)

Notice that for the &gt; case, the Pr(X=a) term is missing again, because we want cases were X is less, but not equal, to a.  Also note that both cases will ""start at the beginning"" of X's range, in our example that is zero, but it could be any value.


&gt;and then transforming them for example:
Pr(X&gt;1) = 1 - Pr(X=1)

This is not correct, but it's close. You probably intended Pr(X&gt;a) = 1-Pr(X&lt;=a).  This also works for the other examples:

* Pr(X&gt;=a) = 1-Pr(X&lt;a)
* Pr(X&lt;=a) = 1-Pr(X&gt;a)
* Pr(X&lt;a) = 1-Pr(X&gt;=a)

This works because imagine that A and A' are mutually exclusive events such that Pr(A) + Pr(A') = 1, then it follows that Pr(A) = 1-Pr(A') and Pr(A')= 1-Pr(A).

So for the case Pr(X&gt;a), the mutually exclusive event, that is, the event that shares no elements with Pr(X&gt;a), is Pr(X&lt;=a).  Thus Pr(X&gt;a) + Pr(X&lt;=a) = 1 and it follows that Pr(X&gt;a) = 1-Pr(X&lt;=a) and Pr(X&lt;=a) = 1-Pr(X&gt;a).

**Remember**, the hardest part of probability is understanding what is being asked, and then converting the question into symbols."

thingsgetwhatever,AskWomen,1389323038.0,"I know very, very little about men's clothing, so take this with a huge grain of salt, but my husband has clothing sensory issues too.  He's worn a suit twice, maybe three times.  What we ended up doing was buying the pants and jacket a size or two bigger than needed and then strategically altering the areas he didn't have sensory issues to fit.  Loose in the legs, fitted at the waist.  Loose in the arms, more fitted at chest/shoulders.  He also tries to find button up shirts with longer arm button things so that when it's okay to take the jacket off he can unbutton the arm buttons and that helps.

This is not a full fix as he still tugs at the clothes a bit.  He also brings a regular shirt and keeps it in the car to change into immediately.  However, it works pretty decently for the time periods where it's been required."

As for how to prevent it, you are either buying very cheap socks or are very rough with them. The higher the quality of the fabric, the longer it should last. Remember that friction is your problem so try putting lotion on your feet before putting on the sock and putting an insert into your shoe to make it less rough. "

~~Why is it that rushing for a sorority is more important than having lunch with him? I realize the whole Greek life thing can be demanding/time consuming, but if you want to commit to it, then you need to also recognize that these kinds of irreparable time conflicts may come up.~~ (this sounds like I'm blaming you for your choice to enter a sorority, which I really did not mean. My apologies).

~~Was he able to see his friends over the break? Why does he not get to celebrate his birthday with his friends who also have birthdays? He probably committed to it before he knew your schedule might be messed up.~~ (Here I overlooked the fact he de-prioritized you, and made changes to plans without consulting you).

Also, I think it's important for you to speak to him openly about how you feel here, and take into perspective the whole situation. He should know your feelings, and you should know his, and why he's committed to this night time celebration. If that's not a conversation you can have with him easily, then I think there's other problems with the relationship.

All that said, I'm sure you guys could find SOME way to meet up. Maybe an hour before he goes out, or before your sorority thing?

LucasSatie,NoStupidQuestions,1389323250.0,"The answer is: usually. If you listen to a lot of interviews of artists that collaborate, you'll come across stories of how one artist may create the melody or the hook and then sell that to another artist. 

Some times these artists will work together from the beginning and thus will have a deal worked out in advance.

The DJ Deadmau5 talks about it from time to time. He creates beats and melodies and then sends samples to different artists or labels. If they like it, they will either purchase the rights or offer him royalties (or some other form of compensation). Actually, Deadmau5 will also rant from time to time about how some artists may ""steal"" (use) his work without compensating him.

Of course, some people will use the work without permission which opens them up to liabilities. There was a TIL recently about how an artist sampled a rock musician's song but didn't get permission and thus the rock musician sued the artist."

Quidagismedici,AskMen,1389323380.0,"I was a first-year in college, having an extremely bad year, part of which was getting dumped by e-mail for someone else as well as many other things. I was in an absolutely awful state for the entirety of that year &amp;, truth be told, things haven't been good since either.

I felt crushingly lonely &amp; completely worthless &amp; I was desperate for some kind of consolation &amp; companionship &amp; to feel wanted &amp; I became besotted with a girl who lived in my building with whom I'd become very close friends. Among my other friends was my housemate who lived in the room next-door, our beds being against the same, paper-thin wall.

Anyway, my housemate knew how I felt about herself upstairs &amp; she had it figured out as well (or maybe she was told; that kind of information had a way of getting around in our building, even if you told no-one) just as I knew that she didn't feel the same way.

My housemate &amp; herself from upstairs started a brief thing, of which I heard far too much for comfort through that wall. What really humiliated me about it was that they tried to be ""secretive"" about it in the most pathetic way possible (spending nights in his room for example) &amp; it was very obvious that I was the only person they were trying to keep it secret from, since other people talked about it in my presence, unaware that I wasn't supposed to know. That really hurt me, first that they thought they had to keep it a secret from me, second that they thought so little of me that they didn't even put any effort into their secrecy &amp; third that they thought I'd be fooled by their stupid little stunts, like her saying she was going to bed &amp; then coming back as soon as I went to my own room.

I gather that a big part of the reason that they did such a shit job of covering it up is because they both thought it should be secret but never wanted to be the one to bring it up &amp; so just sort of fumbled through.

Anyway, they didn't last, a few words were spoken in anger between me &amp; him, but it's water under the bridge now &amp; I'm still friends with both of them, but, to be quite honest, the humiliation of it sticks with me."

el_fakir,AskReddit,1389323528.0,"This happened the other way around, but it was still a bit amusing.

I spend my winters in Chiang Mai, Thailand. There's a smallish group of Finnish expats here, and we spend quite a lot of time together.

A couple of weeks ago we went to a jam night at a local blues bar. As per usual we were talking in our secret language of Finnish. Between songs, when they were switching musicians and swapping instruments, a friend of mine decided to tell a story about a gay gogo bar he had been to. Please note that we were sitting in the front row, about a meter or three feet from where the singer would stand. And this was between songs, so it wasn't very noisy at all. Well, the story about the gogo bar ended something like: ""So yeah, the guys suck each other off on stage and things like that.""

So the new musicians have taken the stage. The new singer/guitarist walks up to the microphone and says (in English): ""Hi there, hope you are having a nice evening, we're going to play some blues for you."" Which was nice. But then he looked at us and continued in Finnish: ""Hi guys, welcome to the show.""

IndieLady,SubredditDrama,1389323543.0,"Here is my issue with this discussion. 

In short, yes you're right, if you choose to get black out drunk at a party, there is a higher risk that something is going to happen to you then if you had just gotten buzzed and caught a taxi with some friends home. Here is why it concerns me. 

The first is, *we know*. We're told this *all the time.* Don't get too drunk. Never leave your drink unattended. Don't accept drinks from strangers. Use a straw that detects date rape drugs. Wear anti-rape underwear. Stick with friends. Don't look too slutty. Don't act too slutty. Never take a taxi home on your own. Don't walk home alone. Don't accept a ride from someone you don't know really well. We're told this all the time, believe me, we get it. I went to dinner with friends the other day and they wouldn't let me take the 4 minute walk home on my own. They drove me there. 

We know this because we're told it all the time. In every thread about rape. Every media debate about a highly publicised rape, it's always there front and centre. This advice dominates every discussion about rape. Yes you can keep telling us over and over and over again, but does it have to be the key and primary message every time the topic of rape arises? Because the discussion about personal responsibility is so dominant, other preventative issues never really have room to breathe.

Secondly, why aren't other public order and personal safety issues treated this way? For example, this report about alcohol-fuelled violence from the [Australian Institute of Criminology](http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/rip/1-10/04.html) finds:

* being young, single and male are the most significant predictors of self-reported alcohol-related victimisation. In 2007, males (6%) were twice as likely as females (3%) to report being physically abused by someone under the influence of alcohol.

* males are more likely to be involved in incidents of physical abuse in pubs and clubs or in the street, whereas for females, these incidents are more likely to be in their own home.

* alcohol-related violence in which both the victim and offender have consumed alcohol are more likely to be spontaneous or opportunistic and more likely to involve strangers. 

* alcohol-related assaults most commonly occur between 9 pm and 3 am on Friday and Saturday nights. 

In short, young males are far more likely to be victims of assault by a stranger, outside of the home. Particularly when alcohol is involved. But is there public discussion that young males should take personal responsibility to reduce their risk? Is there public discussion that they shouldn't go to pubs and clubs, that they shouldn't walk the streets in packs, that they should reduce their alcohol consumption? Is there discussion about what they are wearing or what time of night it is? Rarely.

Here in Australia, media pounce on this issue as we have had a sad number of cases of young men being sucker punched whilst walking the nightclub strip. A young man, [Daniel Christie](http://au.news.yahoo.com/nsw/a/20565028/daniel-christie-king-hit-in-sydney-on-new-years-eve-fights-for-life-as-accused-attacker-shaun-mcneil-refused-bail/), was walking down a nightclub strip on NYE when a stranger walked up and punched him. He's in a coma. In media discourse about this horrifying event, no one questioned whether he should be there, how much he had drank, what he was wearing, on whether he should have taken more personal responsibility. But there has been extensive public debate about increased police presence, licensing laws, tougher sentencing laws, reviews of good behaviour bonds, sobering-up centres, photo ID scanners installed at pubs and clubs, how the media should refer to ""king hits"" as ""coward punches"", it goes on.

So my point is, yes the issue of personal responsibility is an important one and should be had. But please let it not dominate every discussion about rape. There are other important issues that need to be given room to breathe too. That's what I object to, the fact that rape is often reduced to a binary issue of 'tell men not to rape"" versus ""tell women to take responsibility"". We need to view this as a public safety issue like drunken violence, not solely as a personal and private issue that private citizens must mitigate themselves. It is a far more complex issue than that and deserves more thought, more insight and more investment by the public."

Involvement with CPS can open the door for a blunt conversation with your mother. She's probably going to get mad, but your priority needs to be those boys, not her. She can take care of herself. They can't.

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1389323624.0,"Things and Potential Projects I've Been Thinking About:

1) **Chagim AMAs**: So one of the hardest things for me as a convert/non-Orthodox Jew is that I'm not always sure how to celebrate the chagim. What are the traditions? What are the mitzvot? What does that look like for you and your family in reality? What are the crazy fun things that you do that you think others would like to adopt for themselves? 

So what I've been thinking is perhaps doing a chagim AMA series. One month prior to each chag, we post an AMA thread with Judaism 101 level info on the holiday, and let people post what they/their family do for it, and/or the opportunity to ask any questions.


2) **How To Series**: So we're resurrecting the d'var Torah project, for example. Perhaps some people would like to contribute but have never written one before. They have no idea what the process is. It might be helpful to have those who have to write their process down, the resources they consult, etc. It could also include things like: go kosher, celebrate Shabbat, how to find a Jewish community, etc. Topics could be nominated by members of the community. Maybe done once a month, where people post their different methods.

3) **Cross-denominational examination of responsa:** Regardless of movement, we're all grappling with modern issues in our own way. I think it would be really interesting if we could compare different ""movement's/flavors"" responsa on one specific, pretty narrow topic. I don't know if this could actually be done, but I'd be interested in reading

4) **Journeys Series** One thing I've noticed about this group of Jews in particular is that most of us seem to have some kind of significant spiritual journey. A lot of the Orthodox seem to be BTs. A lot of the non-Orthodox seem to be converts. A lot of the non-religious seem to be raised in religious (Reform through Orthodox) movements. I'd really like to hear more of our stories. Perhaps we do it by month by current affiliation. January could be people who currently identify atheist; February Renewal; March Reform; April Reconstructionist; May Conservative; June through December could be different Orthodox flavors, either by minhag/nusach or some form of LW to RW scale or something.
 

I have no idea if any of these are pointless, if they're already covered by the regular Monday/Thursday/Saturday threads opportunities, or what. Totally open to feedback.

You have not been watching the Lakers, then. They weren't abysmal for their first 19 games. 10-9 in the West is pretty great, especially without Kobe. And they beat the Clips and Rockets so it wasn't like they were only beating scrub teams. And it was thanks to pickups like X, Wes Johnson, Nick Young, and Farmar leading the league's most potent bench that it happened.

Of course injuries struck and the Lakers have been awful ever since, but if this team were healthy, they very well would be in the playoff hunt, if the first 19 games are any consideration. And that only happened due to good FO moves, especially given the tight budget the Lakers had."

testudinidae,AskWomen,1389324009.0,"&gt;A man's relationship with his friends doesn't suddenly change just because he is in possession of a wedding ring.

I'm confused.  Are you saying that the process of going from being a single guy to a married man (much of which has already occurred well before the wedding day) doesn't have any effect on his relationships with his single friends?

I'm not saying that things *suddenly* change after the wedding day.  I'm saying that a man's relationships with his friends have *already* changed over the course of many months or years, and the wedding is the punctuation to that change.  He's gone from a single man to a married man, which can represent a profound change in his relationships with his friends.

&gt;acting like somehow fun things won't be (as) possible anymore once he is married

It's not that fun things in general aren't possible after marriage.  It's just that the context of going out is different once he's married.  Single guys tend to go out looking to meet women.  Married guys don't tend to participate in that sort of thing.  That doesn't rule out every type of fun, but it does rule out the subset of fun that involves seeking out single women for mating purposes.

Chances are, when a guy is about to get married, he hasn't been out to meet women with his friends for a LONG time.  Strip clubs provide a relatively safe environment where he and his friends can reminisce about the good times they had together in their single days, safe in the knowledge that any playful advances toward women won't go anywhere."

Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1389324049.0,"Hey there, FYI, your account appears to have been ghosted. It's a mysterious reddit thingy which happens often to spammers as well as those who use proxies and/or post to controversial subs a lot. This is why your posts are not getting voted up, nobody can see them. The only people who can see them are either you or the mods of the sub you are posting to. You can appeal to reddit admins to have your account reinstated but it rarely works. I used to post as /u/nonsequitur1979 [+10] but got ghosted after I started posting in controversial subs (usually because of collectives of trolls who report you for stupid reasons and reddit's algorithms are rather unforgiving if you end up being the target of unwarranted mass-reporting). Try signing out and viewing your comment history and you'll see what I mean. Sign up with a new account and there's a good chance you'll be OK.

I originally noticed all this when I saw your post caught in the spam-trap (which happens automatically for ghosted accounts on most subs). I approved it and others can probably see it now but be aware that all future postings to pretty much all subs are likely to be invisible to all but you and the mods until the mods manually approve it, assuming they check the spam-trap regularly."

&gt;Contrary to that report, Genova’s son-in-law Frank Oleri told the Times, **“We believe she died in her home, but they couldn’t pronounce her until she got to the hospital. “The traffic didn’t make any difference.”**

Now, granted, you don't hear a lot of stories about upheld prenuptials in the manosphere, because those kinds of stories don't get men's blood up. Such a statistic or personal account would be hard to come by.

But I've seen enough prenuptials get thrown out, both in my social circles and in articles and stories I've read online, to conclude that they're not a reasonable defense against divorce rape.

And of course, arguments about prenuptial agreements need only be substantiated one way or the other if we first accept marriage as an option at all - which we don't."

The problem is when people think that the excess weight is what's giving them the curves.

For example, I'm a 53"" bust, with 50"" hips and a 34"" waist, Mathematically, I'm curvy, realisticly, I'm fucking fat, but if I lost the weight, there is a very good chance I would still have a curvy body type.

JonWood007,lostgeneration,1389324383.0,"Ok, now you're strawmanning, or this is one of my posts where I didn't explain stuff. I'll give you benefit of the doubt for now and assume the latter since I dont feel like looking at the exact message I posted (EDIT: yeah, this is the one where i just gave a quick summary without explaining the numbers, sorry).

My figures assume MASSIVE cuts. Like, the entire social safety net is dismantled and rebuilt from the ground up. Between social security ($800 billion), medicare/medicaid ($750 billion), welfare ($400 billion), and other cuts ($200 billion), we can knock the budget down to $1.3 trillion. Universal healthcare, if our spending per capita is the same as other countries, which it likely would be if we have universal healthcare would be closer to $1-1.5 trillion. I assumed 1.3 for sake of calculation, although even if it were higher it wouldn't impact taxation much. 40% flat tax would cover THAT and basic income. 

Between that, and basic income, yes, the state could cut a lot. They wouldnt need welfare. They wouldnt need healthcare. They wouldn't need unemployment insurance. They'd be able to eliminate all that. 

This would allow states to make their budgets a lot more like in current red states, or maybe even smaller. So instead of that inflated 10% rate you get in NY, you might get 5%. City taxes will likely remain the same since their big expenditures are police, fire, education, and core services like trash collection and utilities and stuff, although in my experience, city taxes are generally low. Like 3% or something at best.

Also, does that chart factor in local taxes? I doubt it, I've see it before and it's national only if I'm not mistaken.

http://jsfiddle.net/3bYTJ/11/

Anyway, assume 2.6 trillion and 230 million people in that calculator, set corporate and income tax rates to 40%. You get a $15k UBI. Boom, balanced budget, and enacted a much more solid safety net."

They're taking another step towards being the very type of company they despised back in the day - driven by money considerations beyond what's healthy, forgetting about the ideals aspect.

You can't run a company on ideals alone. This is especially true for a public company. If your shareholders think you're not doing the right thing, they'll get rid of you. As a company director it's your job to make sure you're running the company in the best possible way. If your'e going to save money on tax by moving to the UK, it would be remiss of you not to do so (or at least publicly explain to the shareholders why you're not doing so)."

He pretty much raised me, he was more of a father to me than my father was. He passed away a few days before Christmas, and my husband and I went home for the funeral. 

My husband is currently active duty, and my family asked if he'd be willing to be involved in the honor guard ceremony because my grandfather was so proud of him and it would mean so much. My husband humbly accepted, saying he'd be honored to be involved any way he could.

During the funeral, I was pretty solid. I made it through the readings, I made it through my cousin's eulogy, I didn't even cry when I read a very intense poem I had found that fit.

Nope. Not a tear. Until we went to the back of the church for the flag. I saw my husband standing there in full dress next to my grandfather's casket and I started to lose it. I had no idea what his involvement was going to be until they started passing the flag and handed it to my husband to give to my grandmother.

Silence. Taps. And then I heard him whisper, ""On the behalf of the President of the United States..."" and I broke down into sobs."

You twist this to say women would be for equal treatment *if those onerous aspects are removed*.  While that would represent equality, it misses the point /u/tastykebabs was making, which is that there are many obligations men are subject to which women are not, and would not want to be (and to be fair, who would?) regardless of whether being subject to those obligations would make them more equal.

Jrodicon,skiing,1389324728.0,"If you've only been a few times, chances are you won't even be on at risk slopes. Anything that is at risk is likely to be at least a black. This slide was on a double black. If the run is groomed, the risk is essentially zero. Also ski patrol does a lot of avalanche mitigation, so even on at risk terrain, as long as you are inside the ski area, you aren't likely to ever be involved in an avalanche. There are exceptions, and this is one of them. I heard rumors that Vail resorts were pressuring Breckenridge to open terrain for holiday guests before ski patrol felt it was ready and safe, so that may have played a roll in this case. 99% of (unintentional) avalanches happen in the backcountry, in areas which are not monitored or controlled by anyone, as in (mostly) pure untouched wilderness. As far as being educated on avalanches, even the professionals have trouble, it is a very imperfect science, so for someone inexperienced, you are asking a lot. Most people who are interested in backcountry skiing take several classes on backcountry and avalanche safety, but if you're at a ski area, it isn't really necessary. It is important to think about risks for whatever situation you are in, but worrying about avalanches in a ski area is like worry about shark attacks at the beach, or being stuck by lightning. If you are still worried, there are lots of resources on the web, but there is a lot to learn."

ruta_skadi,AskWomen,1389324759.0,"As for body type, the only thing that I really have a preference for is being kinda broad-shouldered and beefy. Not like Mr. Universe, but some muscle (no problem if he's got some fat with it too). I don't really have a preference for any particular hair, eye, or skin color. As for height, I'd prefer at least as tall as me (5'8"") but I've definitely been attracted to guys a bit shorter than me. I have dated a lot of guys around my height just because I prefer the stockier body type and some tall guys are kinda skinny and lanky, which is ok, but not my first choice.

I like a good-looking face, too, of course. A strong jawline is a big plus. I suppose I like pretty classically handsome men a lot of the time. I also prefer kind of short-ish, traditional hairstyles. Not like limited to buzzcuts, but like not long enough for a ponytail or anything like that, and not a super shaggy teenage skater hair kinda look either. I prefer no facial hair but I can work with a bit if it's short and it suits him. 

There are a variety of styles I like on men as far as fashion goes. I'm not too into a guy who dresses like some subculture just because that seems like a high school thing to me and I'm 23 and finishing up grad school. I like when a guy has clothes that fit him properly and he doesn't just wear the minimum acceptable thing all the time. And he should be able to dress up nice when appropriate. 

As for personality characteristics, I like someone who I share important values with, who I can talk to easily, who is fun to hang out with, who has a similar sense of humor, and who is physically and verbally affectionate. I want to be sexually compatible. I like a man who is smart, sweet, competent, responsible, and dependable. I'd want someone who drinks but doesn't do hard drugs. I want someone who is good at comforting me and supporting me through hard things. It's a plus if he's a cat person but it's also endearing if he likes animals and/or kids in general.

As the other post said, Fergus is basically confirmed to have survived: he is standing and applauding you at the end of game celebrations. He is the Teyrn of Highever then, though in a reply you mentioned that it is hinted that he was not Bryces preferred option: this does not matter because Elissa was anointed a Warden, and Bryce died before formally choosing an heir. Fergus is the only reasonable choice, HOWEVER he is also a widower to a loving wife and child, which throws an uncomfortable wrench in the future succession of his dynasty. If he fails to rebuild the dynasty, his lands fall to Elissa and thus to the crown.

Her position as Teyrn of Gwaren I wasn't sure was possible whilst also becoming queen, but I guess so? If that is so, a Teyrnate given to her in your scenario is basically a big middle finger to the realm - her heirs are Therin at best, non existent at worst. Either way, that Teyrnate is going right back to the crown, and the crown is supposed to be in balance with the Bannorn. So that boon is a massive dick move. I wouldn't be surprised if the position would just be retired and the lands split into banns, they imply that this is the fate of most of the ancient Teyrnates. Between the occupation and Loghain, it's not had a good run recently.

An interesting thing to note is that you do not have to romance Alistair as Elissa in order to marry him and become Queen. This is my preferred route, as it makes the ""Uh, what about the succession?"" conversation snippet hilariously awkward for everyone involved. Regardless, his role depends on whether or not he is hardened. If he is, then Elissa is simply a very powerful noble ally of the crown. If he isn't, then she is essentially the Regent as well, which means theoretically she would be the most powerful Warden in Thedas, literally and legally running a country.

Her position as Warden Commander is assured because she pulled off a miracle in defeating a blight in record time: One Year. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the previous shortest one was 20 or 30 years long, and the first lasted 200 years. It'd be fairly rude to deny her the opportunity of taking up her regional command, she's more than earnt it. Not that the wannabe lord of the Anderfels who is the First Warden is paying much attention to what happens outside of that desert.

Being Arlessa of Amaranthine however is the most solid level of power, but it's tied up in the events of Awakening and not that useful going forward - especially if you assume the revenue of that Arling go directly to Warden upkeep and expansion at Vigil's Keep.

The single most important and solid level of power Elissa has is her influence over Ferelden either beside or behind the throne. Her greatest skills are all the ones she used to win the blight and acquire so many titles, the land itself is a bonus but not essential to her position. Her actions grant her an authority that even Allistar cannot match, especially if she took Morrigan's deal and slew the Archdemon herself. She doesn't need extra titles to make her badass, she already is."

I suspect that the load was too great (probably from friction between the brushes) and the motor just couldn't do it, thats why it overheated. My guess is that 3640 RPM is WAY to high and you will want it to spin slower than the motor. It may be good to take one of the brushes off and see if it will spin it. But since it almost fell apart at 1750 RPM, that may not work. 

I would definitely try a smaller gear on the motor and a larger gear on the brushes. That will make the brushes spin slower than the motor. This will also amplify the torque and you may not need a bigger motor.

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1389324845.0,"I understand why you're uncomfortable. Suddenly seeing your mom in a new sexualized way is so fucking weird. I had to go through the same thing with my mom. She started wearing these *really* tight dresses that even I wouldn't wear, and she would ask for my opinion on them (among a lot of other things). 

I think there can be a balance. It's good that she's living her life and enjoying herself, and you should be happy about that. However, she could also be more discreet. Wouldn't it be weird for her if you just strolled in at 2 AM drunk? She doesn't have to put her life on hold while you're there, but that doesn't mean she should just pretend like her son isn't visiting either.  

Also, regardless of whether she's your mother, it's still rude to be inviting guest over in the middle of the night and create a huge racket. A little more consideration with that would have been nice.  

I don't think people realize on here you need to transition. It's actually *incredibly* fucking weird and really hard to start viewing your parents as ""sexual, social"" creatures. You've always viewed them a certain way and that image is being shattered. I don't think people telling you to get over yourself will do jack shit. What you're experiencing is incredibly normal, and one of the things I was in therapy for.

Just because she's doing her own thing doesn't mean she can't put up some boundaries with you when you're home. She doesn't have to go out constantly. She can tone it down a little bit while you're home, and then live her own life when you're off at college. I don't think anyone wants to be subjected to their parents (or even children's) partying and dating life. 

This is definitely something you're going to have to work on yourself as well. You're going to have to accept that she's feeling good about her self and wants to live her life again. It's a balance. She should still try to act more like a mother around you (doesn't mean she needs to revert back into her frumpy ways, but maybe she does not need to invite her group of drunk friends over in the middle of the night when you're around?).

Yes you're an adult, but you're also her son. Just because you don't need to be nurtured like you were as a child doesn't mean you still don't need a mom-ish figure. 

If you were living with her it would be different because she can't just stop her life for you, but if you're only there for a few weeks it's really not the end of the world to spend the night in with your son once or twice instead of getting piss drunk. 

Just remember it *has* to be balanced. You can't expect her to go back to the way she was. Be happy about positive changes (losing weight, more confidence, happier), and if any more weird situations deal with them as they happen. If you focus more on maintaining boundaries and less on wanting your mom ""back,"" you'll accomplish more with this.  "

Mutations accumulate in the DNA of animals over time and this produces variances in the population.  Some of those are beneficial, some are harmful, most are neutral.  Animals that benefit go on to have more offspring and spread on their new genes more successfully until they are the new normal for the species.

Over millions of years and hundreds of (sometimes violent) climate shifts this has produced the vast array of life forms we see on Earth today.

So what?

And they might not be starting, but Wes, X, Swaggy P, and J-Chill (who I didn't add because he was on the team last year) are all NBA-caliber players (bench of course).

That's not a bully move, it's just a stupid and ignorant one. You literally have not acknowledged the fact that this team was playing pretty well without Kobe, due to the good to great performances of various role players Mitch picked up that no one else wanted.

If you need an extra challenge, wear a backpack and put whatever amount of weight in it which you feel you need to challenge yourself  (half-full jugs of water are great for this because the sloshing action is gentler on joints, you can stay hydrated with them if you get thirsty and if the weight gets to be too much, you can empty them anywhere).  There's just something calming about being in among the trees, rocks, streams and wildlife (which is why I moved out to the country and bought a property which borders a large conservation easement... can literally step out my side door and be in the woods in 10 paces).  Additionally [trekking poles](http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/trekking-poles-hiking-staffs.html) (pretty much the same thing as ski poles) are a great way to work out your upper body at the same time as your legs on a hike, also takes some stress off the joints in your legs, particularly helpful for me because I have a bad knee and about a million old ankle and leg muscle/tendon injuries from the days before I was more graceful and physically trained."

GreenGemsOmally,AdviceAnimals,1389325199.0,"On the contrary to your claim, I DO have first hand experience with the Deaf community and I think you're wrong. I still think it's horrible that they would rather their child go without ever hearing something as beautiful as Debussy's Clair de Lune (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LXl4y6D-QI) just because of wanting their child to adhere to Deaf culture. That's ridiculous. 

As a comparison, if a parent is wheelchair bound due to a hereditary condition and it is discovered that medical technology would prevent their children from ever having the same problem, nobody in their right mind would argue that the child should be wheelchair bound just to stay within the same ""wheelchair"" culture. Yes, people in wheelchairs have healthy, productive, and meaningful lives. They're able to do a hell of a lot, but their impairment still means that they have difficulties where others do not. 

It's the same way for somebody with a hearing disability. Sure, they get by just fine and live happy, healthy, productive and full lives, but they're still at a disadvantage to those with the ability to hear. Any argument that they're not is just simply wrong, due to the way modern society relies on spoken word and sound to communicate to the masses.

I'm a firm believer of if medical technology allows somebody with a physical impairment to virtually eliminate the impairment safely, not doing so is a terrible disservice to the person with the impairment."

There is still a stigma of being too sensitive or even crazy. Men often judge women for being over emotional... I know that I can not rely on a boyfriend to understand if I am depressed or going through mood swings caused by hormone medication for example.  Furthermore, Women judge other women for expressing emotions that differ from the norm. Do you know how impossible it is to tell a group of girlfriends that you don't feel the need to make babies or that you don't believe in soulmates? Our status is still defined by having babies and looking pretty....

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389325341.0,"&gt;I don't see how forcing a person out of you is passive.

Well, compare having a baby to say building a house.  With the baby, your body does most of the work with the baby, you just have to push at the end.  The house requires a lot more *work*, like chopping down trees, clearing ground and hauling stuff around type work.

At its heart, being able to have that baby is what makes a woman a woman.  Being able to ""build that house"" is what makes a man a man.  This is why failing to succeed makes men feel like incomplete men.

Women *can* have these kinds of crises, but the stimuli are very different.  Talk to women who discovered they were infertile, and you'll find women who often feel terrible shame at having ""failed"" as women.

&gt;I don't get how empathy is the root of femininity.

Well, femininity is about nurturing, soothing, passivity.  Think of a very empathic person, who is a good listener, and caring, sets people at ease and gets them to open up, and they'll always be feminine.

Femininity says ""Tell me what's wrong,"" while masculinity says ""I'll tell you what your problem is.""  Femininity says ""Let me kiss that and make it better,"" while masculinity says ""What are you crying about, walk it off!""  Femininity is the garden that grows the seed, masculinity is the gardener who pulls the weeds.  This isn't to say that men are this, women are that.  But this is how masculinity and femininity are traditionally conceived.

&gt;And I would be sad to think negative experiences enhance it, like I have to live through bad stuff to be a woman?

No, no that's not what I meant.  I only meant that if empathy is at the root of femininity, and if suffering increases empathy, then suffering can enhance femininity by increasing empathy.  If you've stubbed your toe, it's easier to understand how someone else feels when they stub their toe.  If you've ever had your heart broken, its easier to feel empathy for someone with a broken heart.

But it's not like you *have* to suffer to feel empathy for others, and it's not like suffering always makes people more noble -- sometimes it just makes you bitter and uncaring.

&gt;Women also have a code that are awarded by other women, like wearing ridiculous fashion just to please/compete with the girls.

Sure.  Not everything is about gender.  A lot of stuff is just about status, about having power over others.

&gt;Also who takes your masculinity? Who has that power? Why do you give them that power?

The really short version is : The purpose of collective masculinity is to do two things:  encourage boys to conform to an ideal provider/guardian male archetype in their behavior, and to separate the weak, incompetent and pathetic men who could not support a child and would be a drain on a mother from the men who will be good providers, and to separate the violent, destructive and dangerous men from the men who would be good guardians. 

Basically, masculinity shapes men into useful members of the community who provide for women and protect them from harm, rather than do something counter-productive to a healthy community.

Masculinity can be flawed into two ways: hyper-masculinity and hypo-masculinity.  A hyper-masculine male is too dominant, over-bearing, violent, a tyrant who terrorizes his family and just generally hard for other men to work with.  A brute.  A hypo-masculine male is weak, ineffective, incompetent, and a load on other men.  He makes their work harder, and he would be a burden on a woman.  A loser.

That, at its core, is what masculinity is about.  Making boys into good men.  And then also making sure that the women only have children with the good men.

&gt;doesn't your body remind you every morning that you are a man?

I assume you are talking about morning wood?  Yes, virility is a powerful reminder that one is male, which is why virile men rarely question their masculinity.  However, a depressed and anxious man who is worried about his masculinity and worried that he is failing as a man often experiences erectile dysfunction, which then causes him to **really** feel like he's not a man.

A woman doesn't have her period, her first thought isn't ""what's wrong with me! I'm a failure as a woman!"" it's ""oh god am I pregnant?""  More than that, a woman can't make her period not happen by being anxious about it.  I know this, because practically every woman I have ever is anxious about periods, but they all keep having them.  A man starts worrying about being a man, and the first thing that goes is the proof he's a functional male."

RichardBehiel,spacex,1389325391.0,"&gt; That said, it doesn't really matter much in the end. If the perigee is a bit higher, that just means more orbital energy imparted by SpaceX, meaning less fuel the satellite needs to use to do its orbit insertion.

SpaceX mentioned on page 29 of [this](http://decadal.gsfc.nasa.gov/pace-201206mdl/Launch%20Vehicle%20Information/Falcon9UsersGuide_2009.pdf) that they expect to get GTO perigee to within +-7.4 km.  If they actually were off by a couple hundred kilometers, that's something they'll definitely have to look at and learn from.

My personal conspiracy theory is that something wasn't quite right with the second stage relight, which would explain both SpaceX's somewhat late confirmation of a successful mission as well as the notably high perigee.  If you happen to own a majestic tinfoil crown, you could even speculate further that SpaceX cut the live stream early because they predicted problems with the second stage relight, which has given the Merlin 1D-Vac problems in the past shortly after the successful completion of the CASSIOPE mission.  Why show ~40 minutes of pre-launch coverage and then cut the feed just a few minutes after launch, when the second stage relight was only 15 minutes away?

Anyways, enough of the wild speculation.  The fact remains that Thaicom-6 was arguably the smoothest SpaceX launch to date, and obviously Thaicom is okay with the orbit so it turned out to be a successful mission.  

P.S. Just to clarify, that's the F9 v1.0 user's guide.  I'd refer to the F9 v1.1 guide but I haven't found it yet.  Still, the perigee accuracy should be similar for both."

If your psoriasis is visible I would investigate all your options for treatment. Not trying to be a dick AT ALL. But if that helps improve your confidence, it is worth the cost. All you need is enough confidence to go to an interview with confidence even if it is entirely for your own benefit. Internal confidence is everything.

Any job you are interested in that is serious and worth your time and effort; investigate all you can about the company and then, mock up a plan that not only highlights the money saving benefit of you working from home but also, how it will increase your productivity. Those are dazzlers for some folks. 

All of my advice is based on your desire to keep with your introversion. If I am misunderstanding that you do not want a career that caters to your personality, please-do not listen to anything I have said :)

GreenGemsOmally,AdviceAnimals,1389325679.0,"I think the point that the OP is trying to make is not that we should euthanize or kill disabled children. Instead, some people do not have the ability to care for a special needs child, and there are a lot of children with disabilities who live horrible, terrible, abused lives because their caregivers were unable or unwilling to care for them. The argument goes that the caregivers maybe should have the choice to decide whether or not they have the ability or mental and emotional fortitude for caring for a special needs child.

You should be remarkably proud of not only your child, but your raising of that child and the fierce protectiveness you show towards what had to have been a sometimes difficult upraising. I'm not attempting to take those achievements away from you. Simply that some people can't take care of a special needs child and the resources available to assist people are often substandard or far below what the child actually needs. In some cases, it *may* have been better for the child to not exist at all, as callous or cruel as that sounds."

I didn't have a bunch of masculine/manly man role models growing up (if you don't count He-Man, and I don't); but I still grew up with a sense of what ""being manly"" was.  Something about being the strong one, the one people could lean on, being a leader if need be, or a good follower.  Not sure how to define it...no hard, fast rule or anything.

I think males are much more...prideful...than females.  Maybe its the testosterone, but we are driven to try to ""be better"".  To be strong emotionally AND physically.  It is NATURE for a male primate to aspire to be alpha, and we take great pride in our accomplishments, no matter how small.

So when something is taken away from us,  it takes away our pride ""as a man"".  We feel ""emasculated"" because we are now somehow less manly.

That could be having a project taken away at work,  a girlfriend who is verbally or physically abusive, a girlfriend who wants to do those things that we feel are manly responsibilities (even if we don't want to do them).

Hell...I've felt ""emasculated"" by Ikea furniture before, because I take pride in being ""handy"" and able to read simple directions and use tools to put things together.  *""I made this!!!!""* So when I couldn't get two pieces to fit right, suddenly my pride was on the line...and having my wife figure out what I was doing wrong, hurt me right in the manlyness.

It is dumb sure, but it is a real thing.  And I don't think it is really driven by society, so much as how much pride some men have in who they are and how they see themselves in the world.  It doesn't have to be something ""manly"" to feel emasculating."
AFormidableContender,AskMen,1389325951.0,"The difference between men at least striving to be alpha, vs men being beta is a matter of nurture and social scripts. Teaching men that timidness is acceptable, confidence without merit is desirable, ""just be yourself"", instilling ideals of fairness when fairness isn't reality, everyone's a winner, and other forms of shaming masculine values creates beta males and beta males content being beta males.

Men are taught to be wussbag, inneffective Nice Guys^TM by their idealistic, feminism-poisoned mothers who raise their boys with the ideals of better suited for subservient husband roles, not strong, attractive, go-getters.

Omega037,changemyview,1389326129.0,"&gt; As far as I know, there is no reputable study showing that plants can feel pain. Also, feeling pain serves no purpose for plants since they cannot react to the pain (ex. run away, fight back).

This gets into more of a metaphysical question of ""what is pain?"", but certainly plants do react to negative stimuli in a variety of ways.  A plant may grow in a different direction, bloom early, sacrifice limbs, or a number of other reactions.

&gt; I guess I see your point here. If I had to choose between saving two random strangers or saving someone I care about then I would save the one I care about. This, however, does not change my argument of human life verses animal life since my cat is one of my loved ones and I would choose to save her over two random strangers.

Again, that is just a valuation calculation.  Your balance is somewhat different than mine, since you value your pets higher.  Still, I think if you were honestly faced with the dilemma of saving one random stranger or saving two random rats, you would choose the former every time.

&gt; Of course you would value someone you care about more than anyone else. That does not justify slaughtering hundreds of humans/animals that you don't know to save one that you care deeply about.

This is the crux of the matter.  I will always care about those closer to me, and a human will almost always be closer to me than another animal.  You agree that you are similar in this, so we are only different in a matter of degree.  Your limit might be at killing three, five or fifty rats to save one human, but it should still be understandable that others might be alright with six, ten, or a hundred rats.

&gt; It wasn't an arbitrary cutoff point. The overall value of animal life is more than plant life because animals can feel pain. I'm not saying there is absolutely no value to a plant's life. *I just meant I would not feel bad about killing a plant to save a human or another animal.*

Their overall value is directly related to their similarity to us.  Even limited to pain, you have been arguing that the closer the similarity of pain to ours, the more value it has.  

Regardless, your final sentence says it all, if you take it to its inevitable conclusion.  **""I would not feel bad about killing a plant to save a human or another animal, just as I would not feel bad about killing an animal to save a human or higher order animal.""**

&gt; There are many types of pain. Emotional pain is a type of pain, as well as physical pain. I do not know of a medical condition that can cause a person to be incapable of feeling all types of pain and emotion at once.

Except you already established that we are talking about ""pain"" of the central nervous system, which implies physical pain.  By making it include emotional pain, you are actually making my case that human pain *differs* from other animals."

It certainly was terrifying at first not having a clue if I was gonna be able to make it work. I knew very little about it going in, but I enjoy working with my hands and creating things, so I figured what the hell. As it turns out I caught on quickly, and now I can't keep up with the demand. 

As a CFer you already have half the battle won. You already understand how to be stubborn, and do what you are going to do regardless of what other people think. That right there is the bulk of it. The rest is picking something you think you might want to try and jump in both feet first. The worst that happens is that it's not for you and you try again. I personally would much rather fail trying to do something I could potentially love than cop out and keep working my life away at a job I hate, because I was too scared, too apathetic, and too lazy to try. I was all of those things for 16 years. 

Like I said. Never again. 

I apply the same logic to where I live. I moved around for awhile when I was younger, because I wanted to find somewhere that fit me. Moving sucks ass. I hate it, but settling for something, because its easier, cheaper, ect. is no way to live. Sure moving is expensive, and you have to make sacrifices to do it, but in hindsight I'm glad I did it. 

Maybe you are already living where you want to be. If so that's awesome. If not then get your ass in gear and do something about it, because you sure as hell don't want to wake up some day and regret not taking any chances. "

Everything in her life is different. She didn't even finish school! She doesn't shower, she smokes and reddits all day, is dependent on you, all of her friends are like this. Even the way she talks is different. She's different. She's not the girl you fell for. 

The sad reality is that *she's* the only one who can fix this. If you continue to stay with her you're just enabling her. She needs to be able to pull her own weight. You can try to help her.

zoeyversustheraccoon,nba,1389326355.0,"I'm a Denver native but I've lived in Seattle forever, so the Nugs were always team 1a and the Sonics were team 1b for me.  

I remember the day the annoucement was made that Greg Nickels was going to drop the lawsuit and all I can say is it was gut-wrenching.  Driving around listening to sports radio, it was sad for me, but it was horrible to listen to the lifelong Seattle residents talk about how they watched the team in the 70's...just something you don't understand until you go through it.  I immediately understood how Browns fans must have felt.  

It was also terrible for all of the little kids who played hoops (including mine) and supported the team.  I also have photographic memories of the guys I played hoops with talking about it, looking so dejected.  

One thing it made me realize though is that there is no loyalty in sports anymore.  Gotta just treat pro sports like you would any other source of entertainment like the movies or music.  I'm not going to get too upset if a band I like puts out a shitty record or if a Tarantino movie is a bomb.  Same with hoops.  That has been liberating actually because I don't internalize it anymore.  

And one last thing- fuck you, David Stern.  It was a series of brilliant moves and he played the city of Seattle exactly as he wanted to make sure that his friend Clay Bennett could get a team.  Looking back at the series of events, Stern orchestrated the whole thing.  "

GreenGemsOmally,AdviceAnimals,1389326426.0,"Those in a wheelchair may say ""this is the way I was born, I don't see it as a disability but an opportunity!"" That's well and good, but they still have a disability. They do not have the ability to use their legs. That's the whole point of the word disability. You can overcome a disability and not let it limit you, but it still exists. The hearing impaired do not have the ability to hear (if we're going with those completely deaf, as the original argument seems to indicate). Whether or not they can work past it is irrelevant, they have a disability. So yes, my point still works. It's a limitation and a disability. Those words aren't evil, nor are they intended to put down the people who live with these limitations. I simply mean to describe the reality.

As to your second point: 

In an isolated deaf community, sure that works fine, but the world does not operate in isolated communities. These people live in a world that revolves around the ability to hear, like the vast majority of the human population. The people with a hearing disability do not live in a bubble. What advantage does a person really have to intentionally deny themselves a competitive advantage that the rest of the world employs?

If a person is strong enough to make do in the world without hearing, then that strength of character comes not from their inability to hear, but from their internal locus of control, their ability to apply themselves and work despite frustrations and limitations, and the support of those around them. Those are strengths that they can rely on with, or without, hearing. There is no real advantage conferred by an inability to hear that is worth more than being able to fully participate in modern culture and society without a limitation that can conceivably be controlled."

It is a common practice to pirate windows, and I not saying I am against piracy, but pirating your operating system really is stealing, which is why the extra ~100$ for windows should be included in sample builds.

Peripherals? Does a TV come free with a console?

&gt;And because PC has so much customization, developers have to worry about different resolutions, hardware, input devices, which always means some companies will make low quality console ports.

All of that should be tackled in the engine phase. If a developer is using a pre-made engine like Source or Unreal, there won't be any issues with different resolutions or things like that. If a developer chooses to use their own engine and wants to port a game over, they shouldn't half-ass it."

We are being raised to understand that women are emotional, and to deal with it.  So in a lot of situations were men would used to have called a woman hysterical and disregarded her for being overly emotional; I think a majority of men now have a much higher tolerance for it.  

Which means women can express themselves in all sorts of ways, that men...wont.   I've had my man card taken from me several times by my peers; but it is all a joke between us. Doesn't mean I don't lose social status, at least a bit, when man points are detracted.

Tuala08,AskMen,1389326556.0,"I would argue there is a lot more active work than just the pushing at the end. You have to work at being healthy and fertile beforehand and throughout. And there is also the whole motherhood part that comes after that, ie building a person, which I think takes a lot of work.
However, you point about infertile women feeling like they failed as a woman really hit home. I think this is an excellent parallel and I thank you for coming up with it because it's helping me see the issue differently.

I do wonder still though at your definitions of masculinity and femininity... how much of those things are innate and how much is just what has been taught? I know some very empathetic men and many incredibly unempathetic women. In fact I believe my sister is one of the least unempathetic people I know, she is almost incapable of putting herself in someone else's shoes and it is rare for her to feel discomfort on another person's behalf. My mom is how you describe masculinity, she always solves problems. She doesn't kiss and make it better, she tells me to get over my problems. (I am realizing perhaps my female relatives have given me a strange view of things lol).

What I keep coming back to though is that why is it making boys into men instead of making children into adults. Girls also need to be taught how to be good, not be drains on men or society etc.  To me it should be ""that's what maturity is about"", not masculinity.  Part of my belief stems from the fact that when my girlfriends were lamenting that there are no ""real"" men around, I questioned them on what that meant and while many gave the traditional things mentioned by a lot of commentors, I realized my definition of a real man actual was my definition of a good person.  

That is true, our periods are not connected to anxiety. However, there are a lot of women who do not have periods, the most common reasons being PCOS and extreme thinness caused by anorexia... this often occurs in gymnasts, some of whom get in trouble if they get their period because it indicates they have too much body fat apparently. That being said, I specifically take pills to stop my periods because of health reasons and I do not feel like less of a woman, it actually greatly improves my daily functioning.  I do see the connection though between virility issues and not feeling like a man, this is a very obvious biological link.  You have a penis, therefore you are a man, if in someway you dont have a penis (because it's not working) you are not a man. While I feel sorry for this thought process because I know it can be really damaging, it makes a lot more sense to me than saying something like ""I am not strong/I got made fun of/I am poor therefore I am not a man"".

Anyways, the burden will be on the next generation to overcome the challenges that face them, and nothing about eating meat is going to cause those challenges to be insurmountable.

This all said, there is plenty of middle ground to be found.  Advances made with GMO crops and soon GMO animals will make producing both meat and non-meat food far less resource intensive and damaging to the environment.  Thus, scientific progress will solve this problem without having to resort to giving up meat."

Sypike,gaming,1389326780.0,"No idea about the PS4 version. 

The PC version is pretty fun. It's kind of turned into a TDM fest because Zombie stopped updating regularly and adding new content (probably to work on the PS4 version) and it's hard to find people for the other game modes. They also pissed off a lot of people (including me) for taking away the 1 day weapon parts and making them 3 days, 7 days, or perm (more expensive in the game's currency).

The weapon system is fun, but requires a lot of time and money (real or in game) investments to find out what works and what doesn't, but you can succeed with any of the equipment available, the higher level stuff just makes it easier.

It's got a steep learning curve.  I'm an average player and it took me almost a year to get that good, learning all the quirks of the game, etc...

I enjoy it very much. I've been playing off and on since the public beta launch a long time ago and every time I come back it's still fun. It's just sad to see the player base shrink so much.

Fire and lightning could be speed-based. You can fire jets of flame or lighting bolts out of your hands, and they push back on you. Pointing these in different directions offer a lot of speed and mobility options for wielders of them. They can't hit as hard as some other elements, but they're more agile. Think of people who use these as ninjas who fight with small daggers.

Biomass and ice should focus on dealing blunt force trauma. Encasing your hand in a tomb of dense ice, or simply increasing its mass, halfway through a punch can transfer immense kinetic energy to the target. These should be analogous to fighting with a sledgehammer. 

Not sure about light or gravity though. Maybe light can divert all of the photons from hitting the enemy's eyes, effectively blinding them for the duration of the fight.

But today I'd had it: 'A doorknob can't be that hard to fix,' I thought 'I'm a grown man, an engineer; I should be able to fix a door.'

""So I got out my tools and disassembled the doorknob as much as I could with the screwdriver, at which point I found myself looking at a heap of parts. I began to try to find the problem: when I was taking it apart a screw had been loose and it looked like the knob and the latch weren't fully connected, but as soon as I figured that out I couldn't find my screwdriver. Swore I'd put it down a moment before right by the closet, figured I'd kicked it in there. I'm not one to go reaching around in the dark so I got out my flashlight and just as I was about to turn it on my screwdriver rolled out of the closet.""

The store clerk looked at me leary-eyed for a moment then asked ""And that's when you came here?"" 

I laughed ""No, no, don't worry. I finished putting the doorknob back together. Then I paused. As I picked up my flashlight the closet door eased closed, almost like the wind did it but that room was sealed shut.""

A close friend's mom is a social worker and works with this type of parents all the time and it's so sad hearing her talk about how there's so many kids who could have been able to have a kind of normal life but because their parents don't care about them at all, they ended up being severely mentally impaired.

&gt;For a woman, who hears comments regarding her sexual value, or lack of sexual value, and who hears comments regarding the sexual value or lack of sexual value of other women regularly, throughout her entire life, this is the message: you are only valuable if you are sexually appealing to men.

I still just dont get it. Keep in mind that you're talking about men who by and large will say things like ""damn, that is one sexy car. Look at that thing."" Have you not ever done something similar, when you see something visually appealing that you remarked on it? Even repeatedly. There's this Porsche next to my house and every time I pass it, i just think, and often say ""God that is beautiful.""

I think the problem is that we're a visual species and we appreciate things we find appealing. I just dont understand how it's sexist. It's not inherently sexist to find such and such a person attractive. Now, if you're offended by their comments, or feel they're making power moves, that's a different story.

Astraloid,GenderCritical,1389327221.0,"Here's my personal 'favorites' from the physical sex catagory:

* Always!

Let's just start this list of with a HARHAR ALWAYS HORNY FOREVER joke, those are hilarious.

* boy with boobs

Apparently a man with gynocomastia or obesity needs a little asterisk next to his gender identification, since boobs = female.

* FePhe

&gt;     Also Fifi. [rare] Female Phenotype. A non-transsexual woman, the
&gt;     emphasis is on the typical female body morph rather than the
&gt;     chromosomes (see also GG).

Anyone else annoyed by these cutesy, alliterative names trans men call women? Yuck. Also, the [glossary](http://www.tsroadmap.com/start/tgterms.html) I pulled this definition from is a work in itself.
    

* FT?
* MT?

I don't know where I'm going, but it involves lots of sparkles and potentially dangerous medications.

* plumber dyke
* plumber femme

If you are as confused as I was when I saw this, the definition manages to be [obtuse, appropriative and horribly sexist](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=plumber%20femme) at the same time:

&gt;          1. plumber femme
&gt;     A femme lesbian who isn't above getting her hands dirty. She's 
&gt;     nobody's little princess, and she's not going to sit in the car 
&gt;     while her dyke tries unsuccessfully to fix a flat. She can do it 
&gt;     herself and, more than likely, can do it better than a hard butch 
&gt;     or most men can.

Your ability to fix cars is now part of your gender identity and an indicator of your physical sex.

*   Galla

Or your membership to the Gay And Lesbian Lawyers Association

*  gelding

Or your identity as a castrated horse.

*  transspecies

No, seriously.

*  metamorph

... no comment.

* MTFTM
* FTMTF

Otherwise known as male and female

*  NEVER!
*  NO!

Haha, more biological sex/intimacy jokes.

* in transition
* transy
* tranz

My physical sex is trans. Period.

* XTX

I am transitioning from genderless to genderless. Don't question me, it's my identity.

* YES!

Did you miss our first joke about sexytimesnowalwaysalwaysnow? Well, here it is again to close off the list!"

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1389327241.0,"Okay, so I wrote this another thread: 

""Okay, give me a few minutes to type out my response. When I was in high school I had anxiety so bad that I stayed in my room all day for a month and only left it to eat, shower, and use the bathroom. I was scared of windows at night, school, cars, tall buildings, germs, ect. Basically my anxiety was so bad that I pulled onto every fear/phobia out there. Give me a few minutes (it may take a little while) to help you out.

Edit: Okay, so anxiety really is about the way you think. Changing the way you think it so incredibly hard and difficult to do a lot of people don't try, give up, or revert back to their original way of thinking. People don't realize how hard it is to overcome a fear or anxiety. It's also hard because anxiety isn't just something you experience mentally, but also physically. It's also something that will never just leave you 100%. Years later I still from time to time get that little anxious feeling and my tummy over something trivial. However, I have the coping skills now to relax and not let that interfere with my life.


So, I know a therapist is the way to go usually, but if you can only see one for once a week it's not going to be that much help. Overcoming anxiety takes a lot of dedication and discipline and relying on an hour long session once a week won't do much for you. You should still do it, but don't let that be your only or main source of help for solving this problem. If you do see a therapist though find one that specializes in CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy).


Anyways, first you need to analyze yourself. You need to figure out what is causing this anxiety. Is is stress from school, work, family? Are you depressed and not coping well in life? You have to identify what it is that has created the anxiety that you are feeling. Then you need to figure out your ""triggers."" What specifically makes you anxious? Planes, germs, spiders? Writing everything out will help you get a clear picture of what you need to tackle. Next you need to identify what is going on in your head when you are feeling anxious. You may not realize it but you probably have negative thoughts running through your head. I know for me I was constantly thinking, ""I can't do this I can't do this I can't do this,"" or ""I'm going to fail!"" I would suggest writing down all the negatives thoughts that you can think of. Really you need to deeply analyze everything that is going through your head long term and in the moment.


Now that you've done this you need to figure out how to relax your overall life. If you're really busy constantly because you have x,y,z commitment see if you can drop something. Don't drop it however to sit and home and do nothing. Do things that are relaxing. Do yoga, go on a run, paint pictures. Do something that helps you feel productive and is stress free. It's very helpful. Hopefully this should alleviate some stress you are feeling thats causing the anxiety.


Now you come up with a plan. Is there a specific goal you have in mind? Are you hoping to be able to fly to Africa despite your fear of planes? Figure out what you're looking for exactly. Then figure out how you'll achieve that. I'm going to use fear of airplanes because that's a huge one for me actually. Do you get anxious thinking about airplanes? If so, overcoming that is the first step you need to overcome. What would be a reasonable step after that? Probably watching a documentary about airplanes, then looking at the sign on the road indicating there is an airport, then driving to the airport, then going into the airport, ect. Basically you have to figure out what are the step progressions you should be making.


Now what your looking at might not just be overcoming a concrete fear. It could be as simple as feeling anxious when walking into the grocery store (yes, I also couldn't go to the grocery store during that time).


A huge thing you need to work on is the way you feel leading up to said event. You are probably dreading that project that needs to be done and the only thing going through your mind is how you're going to fail it and it's going to be awful. Remember the negative thinking that you identified before? Well, now you need to write down positive affirmations to go along with it. I know it sounds stupid, but when you are freaking out it's helpful to look at a card and repeat positive statements written down. It makes a world of a difference. So if you are thinking, ""I can't"" write down, ""I will."" When you see the card repeat what is written down. Eventually you'll be able to think that on your own without the card.

Another thing I found helpful was having a picture of my dogs with me. I had to get blood taken and the first day I couldn't do it. I was freaking out, got hysterical, and had to leave. You know what someone suggested for me to do? To get a picture of my dogs (who I adore) and bring it with me when I was getting my blood drawn. I focused on my dogs and just forced myself to think about them. I was still anxious and terrified but my blood was drawn and I felt so proud for accomplishing that. It was just something so simple but it made a world of difference.


There's also the breathing technique. I find that breathing in a nice, slow, deep breath is very helpful with anxiety. It tells your body that you're not in danger and you can relax.


So the last three things I mentioned are coping skills. Positive statements, positive ""distractions,"" and breathing are tools that you can use to counteract the anxiety that you are feeling. There are, of course, more tools out there but those are the ones I found particularly helpful for me. It takes a lot of effort and time for these tools to become affective. You have to start at step one in your plan, even if it's something so minor you barely feel the anxiety, and practice using coping skills.


Also, I know this was pretty much focused on specific fears, but this works with generalized anxiety. I use my coping skills all the time (and when I say all the time I mean once a month or something) and even for the simplest, tiniest amounts of anxiety they work.


The amount of effort you put into this is the amount of effort you'll get out of it. If you are facing your fear and you decide it's too much and you can't handle it then all your doing is reinforcing that fear. Work slowly, don't bite off more than you can chew, but don't underestimate your ability either.
There are so many recourses that can help you with this. Of course a therapist would be helpful and if you can get one I would definitely recommend it. I also used the book, ""The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook,"" which I found to be very helpful. I bought meditating CDs that I would fall asleep to every night and those were nice and relaxing. Cutting out certain foods (like caffeine) will also make a difference. I tried to be as brief as possible since there is a lot. If you want more information or suggestions I can help you out. Anyways, good luck!

Edit: Also, the degree you use your coping skills depend on where you're at. If you are just feeling mild anxiety you probably don't need to pull out the card, you just need to remember to kick out the bad thoughts and let the new ones in. You really have to personalize and tailor this advice to suit your needs.""

So I haven't taken the time to read through all of that again, so sorry if I'm repeating. The most important part here is actually having a plan. It's incredibly overwhelming trying to overcome panic attacks. Where do you even begin? Taking it step by step makes a world of a difference. Start small. Just identity minor triggers that make you a little anxious, and start tackling that.

One last thing, you need to start figuring out how to afford therapy. It's not an option, *it's a priority.* Even if it means losing cable for the next few months or something. You need to do everything in your power to find a trained professional who can help you with this. "

I don't think I do. I don't think such an idea has any credit in the first place.

Here, it is a shorthand for the fees that are usually incurred when transferring a gun through an FFL-holder (hereafter called a ""dealer"") - often, dealers require firearms to be shipped to them from other dealers (instead of from non-FFL individuals; such a shipment (non-FFL-holder to dealer) IS legal, but sometimes dealers don't want to bother with the hassle). The shipping dealer will usually charge a fee for his services; the buyer may be required to pay that fee in the agreement between him and the seller, in addition to the shipping fees, and the transfer fee on his end, as well as paying for the gun itself.

Gordon may have very well sent your son a message to stop it (whatever ""it"" was) and because your son is young, and dog body language can be very subtle, that message may have been missed at a time when Gordon's patience was short to start with.

Look, it's not your sons fault, it's not yours, and I don't think it's Gordon's either. He's clearly no longer completely comfortable around children (he nipped one and bit the other) so don't force him to be and things will get better.

A Mexican mother and her elementary-age son came in to pick up an order. I showed L how to handle it and then let her take over. Once the mom gave her info to L, while L was pulling it up in the computer, the mom turned to the son and started speaking in Spanish. When L turned to find the photo order in the bin, I could see she looked horrified. She completed the transaction as quickly as possible and the mother/son duo left.

I asked L what was wrong, and she explained that the mom had been telling the kid that she was sorry but that ""daddy didn't mean anything by it"" when he hit him.

We were both so shocked we didn't really even know what to do, and we were just teenagers in our first jobs; hindsight's 20/20 and we probably could have/should have reported it.

Lets watch this group of Starbucks coexist at this particular uninteresting Houston urban intersection.

Right now, it's a peaceful coexistence between the two Starbucks, Both are sharing resources, sharing profit and customers.

Observe the female species, seemingly calm and detached, her tiny shop is bustling with wild customers because they sense a discount.

The dominant male has a grey back, a sign of smug fedora and free wireless signals. He's busy with grunting at customers, urging them along at his drive-thru

Wait a minute, there's another Starbucks, a male, coming into their territory. The first 2 Starbucks barely notices the newcomer, will they respond hostily or welcome him with open arms?

The young Starbucks is learning, full of life and freshness but only to fall stale to customers frustrated at the lack of experience in making the quad decaf italian style cortado with the shots poured on top like a macchiato.

Soon, the newcomer will starve, it can only feed off money but how can there be money if there isn't any left. The female and dominant male are quick to consume food and leaving very little for the newcomer. Later, the newcomer passes, leaving a void spot on the corner of South Shepherd and West Gray. The female and male barely notices the void."

SATXreddit,sanantonio,1389327622.0,"**Again..WRONG**

*35-337 “VP” Viewshed Protection Districts
The purpose of this district is to establish regulations to protect, preserve and enhance of views and
vistas by authorizing and establishing viewshed protection districts. The city of San Antonio has many
views and vistas of historic places, landmark buildings, and other sites of cultural importance which have
always been important to the city. These views will continue to be amenities and assets of great value to
the city, its people and its economy.*


&gt; A fifty story skyscraper could go up in downtown tomorrow if a developer chose to build it. But right now, it's not an economically viable option for spec building

**Wrong:** Page 186 - (d) Development Standards - General. Ordinances establishing specific viewshed protection districts shall comply with the requirements addressed in this section subject to the guidelines included herein. In the event of a conflict between the specific protection district and other provisions of this code, ***the protection district provisions shall prevail.***


If you took the time to educate yourself instead of talking out of your ass you may learn something.  Unified Development Code section 35-337 is not limited to the Alamo Plaza area.  It includes the following properties and others in consideration.


* The Alamo 
* Alamo Plaza
* Mission Concepcion 
* Mission San Jose 
* Mission San Juan 
* Mission Espada
* Espada Aqueduct 
* Espada Dam 
* Bergs' Mill 
* Municipal Auditorium 
* The Old Ursuline Academy
* (Southwest School of Art andCraft)
* Thomas Jefferson High School 
* Navarro Homestead 
* Spanish Governors Palace 
* Yturri-Edwards Home and Mill 
* Church of the Little Flower 

Now use your imagination and draw a little map with the mean of all skyscrapers in Texas...fuck it, the US. And then draw you a sundial that shows where these shadows will fall at certain times of the day and year for each skyskraper. ""New construction beyond or outside of this envelope
that protrudes into the viewshed and obstructs the view of the designated building or site
being photographed, filmed, or otherwise enjoyed by visitors to the site shall be limited by
this ordinance."" Is there a light bulb going off in your head yet?

You are correct about high prices but guess what McFly, most prime downtown real estate in any major city is going to be expensive.  What makes our ""prime"" real estate pricey is the fact that these areas are not impacted by....you guesses it...UDC sec. 35-337.  

Why do you think the Univision Building was torn down so fast?  If is was designated another historical property lots of people would be pissed.  ***The old station will be torn down to make way for an apartment complex. The San Antonio Conservation Society and the Texas Historical Commission have opposed the plan; they want to see the 1950s-era building restored and incorporated into the new development.*** http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Univision-now-broadcasting-from-new-station-4694562.php



Here is the kicker:

Section C (3) - *Using these points, the viewshed shall also define the volume or envelope within which
new construction will be allowed. New construction beyond or outside of this envelope
that protrudes into the viewshed and obstructs the view of the designated building or site
being photographed, filmed, or otherwise enjoyed by visitors to the site shall be limited by
this ordinance.
*

That little paragraph, couple with the section overview, in my interpretation says we are a tourist town..and always will be until something is done to reduce the power/reach of UDC sec. 35-337.  God forbid if you want to renovate ANYTHING that is already marked as a historical property.

testudinidae,HomeImprovement,1389327643.0,"That's a tough one.  You're not going to get a permanent solution for this because your door simply isn't built to accommodate the cat door.  If you really want a cat door permanently, I'd suggest installing one in a non-glass door that you can cut a hole in.

However, here's what I'd try.

Go to Home Depot and get some [adhesive foam rubber weatherstripping](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Hager-17-ft-Self-Adhesive-Weather-Stripping-AE-726S/203155017?MERCH=REC-_-product-1-_-203155016-_-203155017-_-N#) and a [grease pencil](http://www.homedepot.com/p/QEP-China-Markers-for-Porcelain-and-Ceramic-Tiles-2-Pack-38776/100131824#).

Install the cat door in your sliding door.  Use the grease pencil to mark the edge of the door frame on the glass of the opposing door.  Do this on both the inside and the outside.

Remove the cat door and close the door completely.  Now, stick a vertical strip of weather stripping directly on the glass, just to the side of the mark you made so that the door frame will overlap the weatherstripping.  Repeat on the other side.

If you've played your cards right, and you're a bit lucky, the clearance between the window and the door frame should be just about the same width as the weather stripping, which will block the majority of the breeze.  This isn't going to be an awesome solution, but it might help, and it should cost less than $20 to implement."

I don't have any specific sources to cite right off on that but have read it in a number of places.  As for the emoticons, I think it's partially a side effect of simply wanting to be extremely clear about my emotions and what/how I am presenting because I grew up not being able to express myself as clearly as I would have liked and was misunderstood a lot because I didn't quite emote like the other kids and was often confused by how others expressed emotion.  Not sure if that is useful for your notes or not.  I am, however, pretty emotionally sensitive, always have been.

JustinJamm,TrueChristian,1389327706.0,"I appreciate your reasonableness! And honestly, the point here isn't to change your mind -- or anyone else's, for that matter.

Rather, the point is to illustrate, in some sense at least, why current popularity among any elite (however legitimate/trusted that elite may be) should not be grounds for using the force of law to silence alternative views on any matter. Minority opinions can be correct. That is truly all.

---

I likewise wholeheartedly agree that religious beliefs can -- and do -- create enormous biases. It certainly cuts both ways. If one group feels sexuality ""needs"" to be psychological (in order to strengthen or bolster one's own religious convictions) that certainly creates bias. Likewise, if another group feels sexuality ""needs"" to be strictly inborn/biological (to create leverage ridiculing negative views of a sexual lifestyle) that likewise creates bias.

---

Anecdotes aside, even, I would not create a normative pattern/lens through which to assume things about everyone. Rather than presuming that ""anyone's"" sexuality can change, I can allow that perhaps some people's can and other people's cannot -- or at least, can only change depending on specific factors.

Some other data to consider, strongly suggesting environment as more significant than genetics in the matter:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18536986

http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2008/06/gay-not-all-genes

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation#Twin_studies

What suggested by this data is that people with identical genetics (identical twins) simply do not share commonality of sexual orientation as a norm. This does not prove it is changeable, but strongly suggests it is not simply genetic.

This is far more reliable to me than ""large numbers of pooled anecdotes"" told by therapists and/or patients as to whether it is nature or nurture. It does not prove ""choice,"" nor does it justify hatred or bigotry. But it defies the ""it's just genetic, folks"" theory.

This is just my perspective, but I believe people prefer simpler answers. Most people either oversimplify sexuality into a choice-vs-genes ""either/or"" fallacy, but because of implications-bias. Basically we fear the results of one of those two camps being right, so we default to the other one to reinforce our cause. Classic bias. =)"

I have ADHD, and I'm not sure if that makes it worse than usual, but the only other thing that comes even close to the same effect as working out is the Dexedrine I started taking February last year. Even with that though, the combined effects of both Dexedrine and exercise help so much more."

I'm sure if the average American were served actual Chinese food, they would balk at the least. Even if you look at Japanese food, what is it exactly in the States? Sushi and teriyaki. That's pretty much standard. I'm sure there's more authentic Japanese, Indian, Thai, and Korean food that would never make it over here. 

Anecdotal, but everyone I know who's ever had Filipino food has loved it. Now generally ""Filipino food"" is the the ""basics"": Pancit, lumpia, and adobo. 

Sure, maybe something like balut is quite exotic, but so is the vast majority of ethnic food, Asian or otherwise.

To me, the biggest issue is referenced in the article:

&gt; One issue could be lack of support from the community. I know people my generation leap at the chance to try Filipino food when its served in modern or higher end restaurants. Places like Maharlika in New York are actively trying to elevate Filipino food into the culinary scene, but I know for a fact my parents would balk at having to pay $16 for tapsilog. Of course homemade food tastes better and costs less, but it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t support trying to go to the next level.

I wouldn't pay $16 for tapsilog either. There are few dishes I would pay $16 for.

I've asked my parents why Filipino restaurants aren't more plentiful. They even grew up in Chicago, a bastion of Filipinos. Their response is always that Filipino restaurants suck, that you have to overpay to get so very little. I honestly don't know how much of that is true (I grew up in the Midwest, so my exposure to Filipino restaurants is quite limited), but if it is, it really is a problem with the community on both sides of the counter."

I've moved twice now since leaving narcs-ville, and thinking back on both cases, it's always right after the decision is made and announced around my social circle that I finally start to feel like I belong, and they actually are going to miss me.

After the first move, none of the 'friends' I had there have stayed in touch. There are some people that I met once or twice (if that) and connect with online all the time, and I think ""Why couldn't we have hung out more when I lived in that town you're in?""

This more recent one isn't too bad. I still feel the same friends-but-not-friends connexion with the people I interacted with often, but I think the long distance makes it easier to feel more nostalgically like we are good friends even though not once did we really hang out as such outside work.

My BF truly is my closest and best friend/family. Every day that brings me farther along the self-heal path makes me feel like I'm making progress, I'm reconnecting on deeper levels with the few close friends I've kept over the years... brings just one more moment like my current mood, where I'm realising those close friends have never even really been as close as I imagine close friends to be.

I don't think I shame masculine values personally as I am told I more masculine than most women.  I value go getting, emotional strength, leadership, etc.  And I agree that telling people everyone's a winner creates a bunch of people who can not handle reality... though I think this applies to girls too.  I don't think though that feminism poisoned moms are specifically raising their sons to be beta. If that were true then before feminism existed there shouldn't have been so many beta men. A lot of that has to do with temperament like how you deal with new  experiences and how inhibited you are (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Kagan#Temperament) .

If you want to remain in academia, you can't rock the boat regardless of what people tell you. If you propose an idea, regardless of how correct it is, and it upsets Americas conservative thought train, your career prospects just dimmed a bit.

A quick, and admittedly, anecdotal story - approximately 7 years ago my wife's boss proposed a study on using CVD (a component of Marijuana) for epilepsy. He had several RO1 grants and several smaller ones. Despite numerous awards from his work, his grants started drying up. As it's a fairly small group that controls that stuff and they all know each other, his inquiries led to one conclusion - his work, regardless of the benefits, would most likely not lead to the conclusions that the administration wanted - drugs are bad and have no redeeming qualities.

rising_son,Guitar,1389328298.0,"My general ""routine"" (though I don't really have one as such) comprises a bunch of different things. The first time I pick up a guitar in the day I decide within a few minutes of playing what I am going to do with the time  I decide to practice for.

I don't know if I am alone here but some days I play for a few minutes at the start and think ""man I am playing badly today"" and feel uncoordinated. I'm pretty sure it is related to how well I have slept the night before. So if I am having and ""off"" day I often devote the time I have into training my ear, transcribing music and trying to work out new lead lines/licks that I can't play up to speed yet. I basically stay away from trying to play anything fast or technical. 

In terms of rudimentary practice stuff, I don't spend much time on theory as my theory knowledge is pretty top tier already, so my theory ""practice"" is sort of a monologue in my head while I practice other things, like learn songs/do transcription/work out new ideas in my head, and even when I just chill listening to music there is a sort of ""theory monologue"" going on in my head of what the chords are, intervals being used, etc. etc.

I try and devote some time every day to practising technique/chops. But the time I spend on this varies between 15 mins (if I don't have a lot of time available) to anywhere up to 3 hours, or until I get tired. If I get tired I just take a short break then when I resume I move onto another area of practice. My way of practising my chops is more than just the usual ""do these exercises"" until I get better as I find that very boring and de-motivational. Instead, I take the technical practice, and I turn it into something that is interesting. For example, if I decide to practice some legato, I will sit and write some licks/lines using that technique so that practising legato now becomes a creative process for me. This is a very easy process for me because...


...I have a Looper/Phrase recorder pedal in my pedal chain! so some days I spend a while jamming into it to come up with ideas for songs, like Riffs/melodies/solos. It's a GREAT tool for doing this, as I can come up with a riff, quickly track it to the pedal, and set it to loop. I am then free to compose melody lines or solo parts over it and come up with fitting parts. It is useful for working out harmonies and other stuff. If you can, I really recommend you get a looper of some sort. 

I think learning theory and technique is important, but what is more important is that you let your creative instinct drive what you play. Learning scales/patterns/licks can sometimes ""trap"" your sense of feel. It is easy to get ""boxed in"" with scale patterns because of the way they work. Try to think of it as having the control of a car you are driving being taken away from you. Now instead of being the driver, you are just being taken for a ride, without control over your direction, speed, or destination. Training your ear, and combining it with your technical and theory knowledge will ""unlock"" the guitar for you, so that it can do what you want it to.

I have a rule that I go by; Learn a new Lick/Riff/Solo/Song part every day. So I can say to myself ""yep, I learned something today"". I don't really spend much time just ""learning songs"" unless there is something I can actually LEARN by doing it, like a new chord structure/sequence/harmony/technique combination.

Other than that I spend a LOT of time just improvising solo, for example just picking a key and tonality in my head and just rolling with it to see what I come up with. If I hit on something cool, I just track it right into my looper, save, and keep playing. I often do rhythm guitar work outs and I have a kind of ""set"" of songs that I go through for that kind of stuff.

Tl;dr, I take every aspect of my practice and try and meld it with my creative process to make it more interesting and more inspiring."

My problem is, for all of the time spent on ""character development"", The Empty Hearse doesn't show this happening so much. We got John pissed at Sherlock and punching him and stuff, then we get Sherlock trolling him even more with the bomb switch crap.

ImaginaryDuck,ADHD,1389328453.0,"Don't be ashamed of what you are dealing with, it isn't a problem to hide away. It is part of you, accept it and work with it. Talk to your family, they can help you, they have probably noticed a lot of little stuff about your behavior and how you come across and they can help you practice interviews etc. and just be there to support you if things goes bad and you don't get the job. It is much better than keeping it in for 2 months, that shit wears away at you. But I'm glad you were able to get it out at least.

Personally what happened with me when I was diagnosed with adult ADHD is that most people around me wanted to support me and were happy that I had finally got things figured out so I could start working on them. My dad on the other hand said ""Oh I knew there was always something wrong with you"" I don't talk to him much anymore...

* Taking care of your mother's finances when you know she has a gambling problem is being an enabler.  Her addiction will only get worse if you continue to be her fall back.  Not only is it bad for her, but it's also horrible for you.  Don't be weighed down by someone else's poor decisions.  This economy is throwing you enough curve balls as it is.
* Your mother is emotionally abusive.  You already admitted she has controlled your life as much as she can up until this point.  She tells you you're going to hell and it will be like you were never born if you leave.  She's trying to scare you into staying because **she needs you more than you need her**.  She knows she'll have to find a way to overcome her gambling problem or sink without you and she doesn't want to change.
* Your dad supports your relationship.  He left your mother years ago and how is he doing?  You didn't talk about him much, but it sounds like he's doing just fine.  Maybe you should follow his lead?
* As for your relationship with this woman in AZ, you really have no idea how that relationship could be if it had a chance to be in person.  Frankly, I think all this drama with your mother has distracted you enough that you haven't had much time to think about it.  Sure, the age gap is pretty large, but I've seen couples with an age gap like that turn out really well.  I think moving to Arizona is a great idea provided you have your own place for awhile.  This is partially for you to have a chance to live in your own space without anyone else as well as for her kids.  Even if you have a great relationship with her kids, they're probably going to need some time to get used to you before you move in.  

All in all, I think you have real potential to have a wonderful life.  You just need to take those steps and leave mommy behind to face her own problems she has created.  Keep in touch with your brother.  I don't doubt he will face these same issues in several years time, so try to be there for him when he needs guidance.  Give this relationship a go and see where it leads.  Even if things do go bad in the end, you will still have the freedom from your mother and be in a better position to find someone who is right for you.  Best of luck!"

If we can create anencephalics deliberately, then abortion would serve a positive good by being the source of healthy, useful fetal material. And nobody wants to block potential cures for anything, especially childhood maladies; ergo we must keep abortion legal. I mean, come on, *it's for the children*.

Pachacamac,askscience,1389328847.0,"It really depends on who you are talking to. I'm not sure where the state of sociocultural anthropology is right now (I'm an anthropological archaeologist), but ""culture"" is a pretty loaded term. We all recognize that we study cultural things (and material culture--artifacts--is central to archaeology), but a lot of anthropologists have basically stopped using the term culture. I certainly have and usually use ""society"" now as a more neutral term.

Basically, the problem was that the entire concept of ""culture"" as a specific entity was more-or-less created in the early 20th century. So we talked of cultures, like they were bounded, unchanging things, a collection of specific attributes that made up that ""culture."" And each culture was supposed to be wholly separate from any other, so that you belonged to one or the other, never both, never multiple. These are all highly problematic concepts. Any one person has multiple cultures; for example I am part of Western culture, Canadian culture, urban culture, academic culture, etc. The culture concept, as it was formulated, also assumed that everyone within a certain culture thought and did essentially the same things, wore the same clothes, had the same worldview, etc.

We now take a much more detailed, nuanced approach to studying people. And the culture concept was too far gone to be saved, and was too loaded of a term. We recognize that we are studying cultural traits--the things that people do, the way they dress, their religion, etc.--but we can no longer call a relatively similar collection of these cultural traits ""*a* culture."" So we use ""society"" as a less-loaded, more descriptive term. ""Community"" is often used in the same way.

And I've also heard anthropologists refer to cultural things as things such as art, style, religion, etc. and social things as governing systems, economic systems, etc. I don't know how widely those definitions are used, though."

Everything else is pretty much negotiable. I work for a software company that makes dealership finance software and get to look at actual deals when sorting out bugs sometimes. For instance, I looked up a car I bought and found they made $1600 profit. A bit high, but still fair for the price of the car. They generally have an absolute ton of leeway on basically every fee charged.

The main thing you need to be aware of is the final price with all taxes and fees included. You can haggle them down on the ""price"" of the car, but then they might jack up the other fees and maybe (if they're shady) even add other fees to make up the difference from what you haggled down from. Pay attention to the fees and if you don't know what one is, ASK! $100 fee for vacuuming the car? Get out of here! Say you won't pay it. They'll usually work with you. to make that sale."

But I can tell you about the very tangible affect improving your social life and raising your ""sexual marketplace value,"" as it were.

Once you got it in your head that you would need to start hauling ass to make something of your upcoming single life, you started making yourself more attractive and more outgoing. Your wife, along with a bunch of other women, noticed these changes.

So, she reacted as a person who a) had dibs and b) saw you in a light that she hadn't before.

Naturally, you feel hurt. Did she do the same things to win you back? Also, why doesn't she just feel attracted to you for ""who you are deep down?"" Add on top of all that that she was the one who initiated the divorce conversation.

Then again, if you go with that line of reasoning, you will find reasons to resent your wife. If you really want to stay with her, you can't fault her for losing/gaining attraction to you. You have to accept that attraction is NEVER static, even between the most devoted people. Devotion and attraction are almost two completely different things.

I really can't tell you what to do because you know your life and your wife better than I do. I just hope I was able to shed some objective light on the dynamics here."

I'd go shopping with my boyfriend and we'd be the cutest most lovey-dovey gay couple. I'd slap his ass whenever he bent over to look at merchandise and we'd giggle at the reaction it elicits from strangers. I'd suddenly develop a higher pitched voice and go decor shopping, making other customer's hold back their laughter as we acted like the stereotypical ""outrageous gay couple"". 

I'd check out a dozen romance novels, the ones with bare-chested naked guys on the covers, from the library. I want to see their reaction.

GeoffreyArnold,short,1389329321.0,"&gt; Like I can't even imagine the similaritites between the social outcome of a gay, trans, or minority race and some guy show is 5'5 **barring intersectionality....**

Why would you bar intersectionality?  So, you want to compare other minority groups to only straight white protestant males under 5'5""?  It doesn't work like that.  Just as gay people represent a wide variety of colors, genders, life experiences, and  financial backgrounds....so do short people.  You'd have to compare short men as a group (say, 5'5"" and shorter) across the board (without regard to race, class, religion, etc.) to gay people as a group...or black people as a group...or whatever else.  

We already know from the statistics taken thus far that the wage discrimination against short men is similar in magnitude to the race and gender gaps.  So it wouldn't surprise me if the statistical data showed us that short men (**as a group**) have worse social outcomes than many traditional minority groups.

derleth,bestof,1389329493.0,"I thought I'd catch you out in a contradiction, but that's not going to happen. My point was to get you to realize that disease is culturally contingent, but you already know that apparently.

My point is that being morbidly obese is like being a drunk: You have a dysfunctional way of approaching the world, usually based on stress and reward mechanisms, and your body suffers for it. It's probably ultimately a biological disorder, but we can't fix that yet, so management is the only option.

That said, laughing at obese people for being fat is like laughing at drunks for getting drunk, or laughing at people who attempt suicide, a point I made elsewhere. And this will always be compared to that, because it uses the same language and has the same targets.

It's easier on everyone to just have the TITP posts without commentary. Otherwise, there's an endless cycle of attack, defense, counter-attack, and so on, all founded on subtly mistaken premises."

holyerthanthou,Fitness,1389329698.0,"As a beginner I can **understand** what they are doing.

I have no problem with bodybuilder types and I go to the gym on my college campus. **BUT**, the people that frequent the college gym are either A:Bros B:Builders C:SMOKING HOT GIRLS. All-in-all for someone like me it can be a bit intimidating sitting on the bench struggling with just over a hundred pounds while the guy next to me is pumping out reps twice my max.

If it wasnt for the fact that I've had **NOTHING** but good experiences with those types I'd be nervous too. But most people dont feel the same way I do, and to a lot of people the hardest part about exercise is the comparison of you... to those around you that have been at it for years.

Planet fitness gives off that vibe that they target to beginners, old people, and stay at home moms who get intimidated by stereotypical gym-goers. 

If they think that removing squat racks will help gain revenue, let 'em. if you don't like it stop paying them and choose somewhere else if you can. They are trying to control the atmosphere like a highclass restaurant will kick you out if you show up without pants."

 Some tips:

People don't really smile if they don't know you, get used to it. If you smile you're either stupid or you want something so this can offend people. 

Planning is key. You really have to have a schedule of what you're doing. If you're going between cities take the train because the roads are awful. We were driven in a bus for 7 hours and it was horrible. 

Learn some Russian and definitely learn the alphabet. The more Russian you can learn is better. I knew maybe 50 major phrases and the alphabet before I got there and had a lot of difficulty at times. The more ""American"" restaurants/cafes/bars/etc had English speakers present but at a lot of the rustic places it was difficult.

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389330593.0,"&gt;I do wonder still though at your definitions of masculinity and femininity... how much of those things are innate and how much is just what has been taught?

I don't find the nature (genes) vs nuture (memes) debate useful, because the reality is that there is *clearly* a feedback loop at play.  Men and women *tend* to act a certain way, people make observations about how they act, people distinguish some actions as good and others as bad, they encourage the good and discourage the bad, and slowly a set of gender rules comes into form that at first reinforce gender differences, and then begin to inform gender differences as children are raised to conform with the rules.

The rules themselves are memes, ideas shared in a culture.  But some memes thrive and some memes perish, and the ones that thrive are the ones that come naturally to people and actually work.

For example, there is **no** society we have ever found any evidence for that did not make childcare a central focus of the female gender role.  Every society binds motherhood and being female together, and for good reason.  A society that expected men to bear the children would not last long, since that's impossible.

Likewise, while some societies have the ""no women can fight"" meme and some societies have the ""women can fight under special circumstances"" meme, there has never been a society that did not have the ""men fight the battles"" meme.  Women don't fight or they fight alongside men, but they never fight *in place* of men.  This also makes sense, because a society that had a ""women do all the fighting"" meme would quickly get wiped out by societies that didn't have that meme -- not because women are weaker, but because women make babies but not if they die in war.

This is why some memes, like male dominance in sexual relations, die hard.  People cling to them, because if you look at the science, it's pretty clear that the vast majority of men are turned on by being dominant, and the vast majority of women desire men to be dominant (within parameters they control).  This is why you get feminist BDSM submissives and *50 Shades of Gray* outsells everything ever despite 60 years of feminism saying this is wrong.

&gt;What I keep coming back to though is that why is it making boys into men instead of making children into adults. Girls also need to be taught how to be good, not be drains on men or society etc.

Gender roles are, in theory if not practice, about being a good man or a good woman.  For the most part, being a good man or a good woman is pretty much the same as being a good person.

Men seems to need their own role.  Call it *womb envy,* if you want, but men in every society in history have had a male-culture that was separate from the culture at large.  Men need a way to distinguish themselves from women and make themselves feel useful.  It's like a very intense psychological need to prove that even though we can't make babies we are essential.  [This](http://www.reclusiveleftist.com/2006/05/07/the-origin-of-male-dominance/) is really great blog on the subject, and really does a through job of explaining the idea.

&gt;However, there are a lot of women who do not have periods, the most common reasons being PCOS and extreme thinness caused by anorexia... this often occurs in gymnasts, some of whom get in trouble if they get their period because it indicates they have too much body fat apparently. 

That's a survival mechanism.  A woman who was starving because of famine or a harsh winter would not want to become pregnant, because she wouldn't have the energy to spare for the child's development.  So, heh heh, nature has a way of shutting that whole thing down.  Except, unlike Todd Akin's asinine statement about rape, this is true.

Gymnasts, by reducing their body fat to such low levels, trick their bodies into thinking they are in highly stressful, work intensive, food deprived situation.  Anorexics are just plain old starving themselves."

Jourdin,Dogtraining,1389330635.0,"The best analogy that I've heard is that many dogs that are traditionally trained are taught ""stay in this box. Do not leave this box, or you will be punished."" (The analogy being box = acceptable behavior parameters.) Whereas positively trained dogs sometimes learn to push buttons to see what gets them a reward. When they understand that something is not rewarding, they are less likely to try it, until they eventually give up altogether. A good example is jumping up on counters or tables; most dogs do it initially because they smell something good, and no one is keeping an eye on them, so they are rewarded by being able to eat the good thing. They are more likely to continue trying to jump on counters even if there is nothing there because they've been rewarded (or, a better word would be reinforced) in the past. Dogs who try jumping on counters but do not achieve eating the good thing are less likely to jump on counters again because it is not a rewarding behavior.

I do understand that those old school methods that many of our parents used do look like they work. And they do work, but for different reasons. However, Cesar Millan is often working with serious cases of aggression, which would be treated by positive trainers with scientific based behavior modification techniques. Cesar's methods are based in dominance theory which has been completely debunked. His methods... they just completely veer away from the point. He has absolutely no formal training and knows nothing about the true science of dog behavior.

The problem, I believe, stems from people either treating dogs like people, or from people believing that dogs see humans as dogs and that we must act like dogs when we interact with them. But since so many people don't have a good understanding of how dogs act (i.e. they believe in dominance theory and pack theory and think dogs need ""assertive leaders""), treating a dog as if it sees *you* as a dog really doesn't work.

Sorry that was so long! I guess the tl;dr would be: old school methods do work, but for different reason than newer, scientific-based positive methods. Old school methods are now becoming seen as inhumane to an extent. Cesar Millan's methods are especially inhumane, and work even less than ""old school"" methods."

ThisWanderer,WritingPrompts,1389330643.0,"Today I am old and warm. With my great-grandson upon my lap and my family all around me. My Daniel died twenty years ago with a smile on his face; he looked as happy as he did when we got married. And I lost my little Arthur just last year; even on his deathbed he was telling me to see a doctor, such a sweet son.

My great-grandson looked at my arm, then up at me ""Safta, what does this mean on your arm?"" And I look and I am transported to my youth.

It's damp, and the fog rolls across the train station as we get on the train. I'm between my parents, holding their hands. I didn't know where we were going, but I knew my father was awfully mad about it. He had spent the whole morning screaming that they couldn't do this to us. The train ride took a long time and the cars didn't hold a lot of heat; I was looking forward to getting somewhere warm. 

Finally we got off and  we followed everyone else. They pulled my father aside with the other men and I cried out ""Abba!"" But he was gone into the flow of people. My mother held me closer; then we reached the barracks. They inspected us and the man who saw me looked at me with pity in his eyes; he approved me to work and sent me off to be further processed. Mother was in front of me. There was another path that led towards smoke in the distance.

At the next station they shaved our heads and had us hold our arms out. The needle stung and I cried; the man looked at me and told me to save my tears. I met his gaze. Then I knew these were wolves in men's clothing.

In the days we would march and work in the factory. They would hit us if we ever stumbled or fell. Sometimes we were given food. 
The nights were the times we feared; the soldiers would stroll among us appraising us as the meat we were to them. You could see their appetite, and they were not polite eaters. The less demonic brought a little more food for their picks; a captain took a liking to my mother. He was not of the less demonic. He made me watch. At first she resisted and then there was no where left for her to bruise. She stopped eating; she gave her food to me and said I must be strong. She wasted away and in two weeks, I was an orphan.

Then the captain came for me. I saw what happened to my mother and did not resist. I still can hear him calling me a filthy pig. This went on for months. When the Russians came they shot the captain as he ran. I'll never forget his face as he looked up at me from the cold wet ground.

I shudder as the memory washes over me. He is cold and gone I tell myself.

My great-grandson is being scolded by his mother, ""You don't ask Safta questions like that, Daniel!""

I cut her off ""No, no. It's okay. Daniel, this is a memory of a long time ago. I was young and cold, but now I'm warm and old and the man who gave me the memory is even warmer than I am today."""

I do get that some people are bothered by this sort of thing, for example I know a woman who is deeply unhappy about the fact that her boyfriend designs weapons for a living, but personally I think a job is a job. Plus on balance there are probably medical professionals who have a higher kill count than the average soldier, and they're not even meant to kill people. 

If your girlfriend heard 'military' and didn't think to ask what you did there knowing that she couldn't cope with dating someone who had killed someone, I really think she needs to think about who she's dating and what she wants in a partner if she's not going to check for basic personal deal breakers like 'has he killed anyone'. To me that just seems like she was possibly a little self absorbed and didn't really bother to get to know you very well. Geez, my driving instructor has told me more about his military career than you've told your girlfriend, although I sometimes think that's so he can remind himself that he has actually been in more dangerous situations than being in a car with me."

Yes, basically there is kind of a broad genotype that we all start off as in the womb. Male nipples are thought to be kind of a carry over that doesn't have any detrimental effect so had no reason to be selected for.

Interestingly, this same ""carry over"" logic is thought to apply to the female orgasm. Scientists see that only a minority of women can actually have an orgasm and question the logic that having one would have really increased the reproductive success. Therefore there is a theory that female orgasm is a carry over from the male orgasm (which is absolutely necessary for reproduction), similar to nipples.

So, how'd I do? You impressed? Can I get the digits?"

MrF33n3y,travel,1389330884.0,"I don't mean to hijack the OP's thread or anything, but I visited Russia last year as well and thought I'd give my .02 quick. I won't lie, I was definitely nervous about Russia up until the moment I got through customs at the airport. It's just very...nerve wracking to be going somewhere that you have to jump through so many hoops just to get your visa. My layover was in Riga, and I found it a little unsettling how just on the other side of the fence from the tarmac there was all these decommissioned Soviet aircrafts. But once I'd landed and gone through customs (Which is surprisingly easy for how much work the visa is), I absolutely loved Russia. I didn't find St. Petersburg or Moscow the least bit sketchy, I felt very safe in both cities. It was hotter than hell the week I was there in mid July, between 80 and 95 most days. 

The toughest thing about Russia is definitely the language barrier. *Very* few people speak English, let alone well. I did take the time to learn some of the rules of reading Cyrillic but not nearly enough to actually read much. I found Russian people to be about as helpful as you could expect when there's a language barrier - I had to rely heavily on charades, pointing on a map, etc. when I needed help. Taking the metro was a matter of comparing the signs in the stations to my metro map and hoping I ended up getting off at the right station.

But I really loved Russia and I'd definitely consider going back someday!"

My point is that you asking what we think of women with red hair is pointless. Dye your hair whatever color you want if that is what you want. It's silly to validate people's stereotypes of blondes by removing yourself from that category because you're not a typical ditz.

Some don't like more than 7"", because their cervices are lower than usual, and for most women hitting the cervix in painful. Then there's girth, which is a whole other issue. Some women have smaller and less stretchy openings. I, for example, end up tearing when I'm with someone who is any more than 4"" around. My boyfriend is the largest I've ever had, and I'm only able to take him because he's not extremely wide and I happen to like my cervix being bumped during sex. It's made me bleed before, though, and sometimes I hurt for days afterward. 

You sound extremely defensive. I'm sorry if you're insecure, but there are many ways to have a fulfilling sex life regardless of the size of your genitals. Just as women can't control their vaginal size (where ""looseness"" is attributed to being promiscuous when that has no bearing on vagina size) men can't control their penis size.

essentialliberty,Coffee,1389330958.0,"OK, you did say cheap: boil water in a pot or the microwave. Put 6 oz of boiling water in a cup, add 2 Tbs of coffee, stir. Allow to steep 4 minutes. 

Drink carefully and avoid the last ounce. If grounds bother you, you can get a french press which just allows you to filter the grounds, otherwise it's the same.

For me, fresh roasting and grinding are the critical factors, so if you can't afford a grinder then buy in the smallest quantity you can and have it ground for french press. Use it right away and then see if you notice a difference over the next days as you continue to use it. It will probably be worse the second day. A cheap chopper style grinder would be the next purchase, and would allow you to buy 7-10 days worth of fresh roasted coffee at a time instead of just a day or two. In the end you will not want the chopper so if you can afford a nicer grinder, skip the chopper and go with one of the other options mentioned.

I notice ground coffee being worse after 24 hours or less. Roasted whole beans are noticeably worse in 2 weeks. Ask when you buy them when they were roasted.

&gt;I would be the first to admit that I am a callous person when it comes to the suffering of drug-addicts as I feel that they are undeserving of our sympathy and are the very definition of weak.

You seem to have missed everything I said regarding some people's unfortunate circumstances being the cause of their troubles, and not necessarily any inherent weaknesses they have. However, aren't the weak and unfortunate the *most* deserving and sympathy and aid...? Jeez dude. It sounds like you are basically saying ""If you suffer because of your own mistakes then you are weak and not deserving of my sympathy or aid. Fuck off."""

Moggehh,AskReddit,1389331214.0,"I had this great idea to do shrooms with my (now ex)boyfriend back when I was 16. My brother told me to take about 5x the starter amount, and I trusted him, so we got pretty fucked up, and ended up having a spectacularly terrible trip. 

So it was October, and we did the shrooms in a city park, where at some point a skunk ran past us. After a terrifying 3 hours of trying to get out of the park (it was big and we got lost), we somehow managed to make it downtown. We went to catch a seabus/ferry, and we had the most intense hallucination I've ever experienced. All of a sudden, every person in the terminal was staring at us. My boyfriend asks me if maybe after all we had been sprayed by the skunk. That would explain the stares. Then, they all started laughing. Suddenly there was sound everywhere, even the building was laughing at us, shaking with huge chuckles. We ran out of the terminal in absolutely fear. 

I called my dad and told him we'd been sprayed by a skunk. He rushed downtown to come and get us, and had brought a ton of garbage bags and towels and fresh clothes. So, he was pretty confused when he showed up and we clearly had not been sprayed. I said I would explain and we both got in the car. 

*""Dad, I'm going to be honest with you. I got mushrooms from _ and we are tripping balls right now. We need to go home.""*  

So he called my boyfriend's mom and dropped him off at her place and drove us home. I got a moderately stern talking to on the car ride home, but I don't remember any of it. My dad ended up calling my mum and complaining that I was experimenting with drugs. I am still made fun every family gathering, but other than that there was no repercussions. My dad was a pretty chill dude about that kind of thing. 


**TLDR: Got ""sprayed"" by a skunk while on shrooms, called my dad for help, no skunk smell so had to admit to being spectacularly high. Had an awkward car ride.**


EDIT: forgot my porn story. When I was 8, I found one of my dad's penthouse magazines. I didn't know what it was, but it interested me so I took it and hid it. I told my school friends about it, and they told me to bring it to school, so I did. We got caught tracing in the library by a 10 year old. Worst visit to the principal's office ever. Also, to clarify, I'm a girl. Parents just thought it was hilarious, although my dad got in trouble for leaving porn lying around. "

I have been able to use my mother as a way to predict my likely experiances.

This probably isn't very helpful, but it can be a starting point if you have a relative or friend who is similar to you in terms of your cycles and symptoms, ask them what they have tried and consider that as a brand to start on.

Sadly there is no way to predict, and finding the right method, and then the right brand within that method takes trail and error. 

Make a list of what you want to gain from birth control, make a list of things you are nervous about developing, and try and get familiar with some formulations.

as a general rule, pills containing higher doses of estrogen tend to give you better control over your period, but come with a higher risk of stroke. Brands containing drospirenone tend to help clear up skin, but are more well known for mood-swings. Desogestrel is better at managing weight or thyriod conditions, but comes with a risk of clots. Norethisterone acetate tends to reduce symptoms of PCOS like facial hair, but can cause depression. levonorgestrel. is a bit of a wild card,."

thebumm,offmychest,1389331433.0,"Even now, I don't understand what's worse, after reading all this and the responses. I get you felt betrayed or wrong, OP, and you told him that. You say his apology sounds fake (the second time) but that's exactly what I'd have said, too. You had already told him how you felt about it all, he apologized. You then recapped with him, and he again, apologized. He already knew how you felt, but you wanted to go over it again. His second apology was just that, a second one. He already go it, but you needed more. That's on you, not him.


As a depression sufferer myself, I feel yours is tainting your judgement here a bit. People without this issue don't understand it. Even people with it don't understand everyone else's. He was trying to be a good friend. He went about it in a different way, but that doesn't make him a bad guy. You didn't refuse it, in fact you are saying you liked it - but only if it meant nothing to either of you. If he had done it because he liked you, you'd have to cover that ground and reiterate you aren't into him, discuss boundaries, etc... You could still be friends, just you'd both be more heads up when you're drunk.


As it stands, if I'm him, I'm a concerned friend thinking, *I apologized twice for trying to help in the wrong way, what is wrong?* He just made a mistake, but I hardly think he broke anyone's trust, here. Why is it okay to fingerplay without any feelings, but not okay to do it out of caring, loving, protectant friendship? You viewed cuddling and whatever as appropriate/helpful (as did he), and he viewed this sexual stuff as similar. The only difference is, you disagreed with that. You've covered that with him, twice, he gets it. He was just trying to be a friend, you told him that doesn't work. He can't undo it, but it seems like that's expected, and it shouldn't be.



He obviously cares about you. I think probably both made some mistakes here, he's apologized, I hope you can move past it.

Of course I can offsett a little by working out, but it doesn't help that much. I don't know if this is simply because I'm short/small or if there is a genetic component. All I know is I have to be extremely restrictive in my diet to lose weight. Eating 1200 calories a day is doable if you're eating the right things, but our culture isn't built around that. At every turn there are cheaper, faster, more available options than cooking a piece of chicken and steaming a couple of vegetables every night.

Eventually I realized that I was just breezing through songs that I previously hadn't even considered learning because I thought that they would be too hard.  Then I went back to songs that I had tried to learn but gave up on because they were too hard, and I surprised myself at how quickly I could learn a new riff.  And now I can learn a Tool song, or a Metallica song, or a Led Zep song in just a few minutes.

Just keep going.  And as for bass, as long as you have good rhythm it's fun and easy.  It's an instrument that can inspire some incredibly groovy riffs that you can port over to guitar too."

positmylife,relationships,1389331860.0,"Well now, I see several issues here.  You snooped through her phone but she discussed marital issues with an ex.  If my SO did that, I'd be upset.  It's actually happened before, but I never snooped to find out, he just brought it up not realizing I felt it was a breach in privacy.  I don't think I've ever snooped, but I have asked to see messages from girls who were throwing themselves at my SO to explain with examples of why it was inappropriate (this was in high school).  From there we discussed boundaries.  In your situation, the best course of action was when you stumbled upon the mention of yourself in her message preview, you should have just asked her straight up.  It's obviously too late to change that.  

I think it's perfectly reasonable for her to be upset about the snooping now that she's heard your issues with her actions.  You guys made an agreement and if you don't remember making it, that's really your own personal failing.  I don't really think it's unreasonable for her to ask to see the messages with the girl.  This is a chance for you guys to discuss boundaries.  She knows yours.  Now you're going to find out hers.  You both messed up and injured the trust between one another.  You both have to work to rebuild it.  It's obvious that you don't understand why she's inconsolable about it, but try to think about it from her point of view.  She's wondered about you and this girl for awhile but resisted snooping because you both agreed that was a boundary.  You said she was wary about her so that implies she brought it to your attention before, like you agreed to.  Then she has a conversation with an ex she thinks just needs someone to talk to, accidentally oversteps a boundary that was not clearly established, and instead of coming to her about it like she has with you, you go behind her back and snoop.  If she's really be wondering about this girl for all this time, the worry has probably been slowly eating away at her.  She respected you though.  You didn't respect her.  That is why she is so upset.

I know she messed up by discussing things with him, but that seems like an honest mistake.  Your snooping was deliberate and she feels betrayed by that.  You need to seriously consider that before you try and talk about this with her again.  "

ironic_mustache_ride,chicago,1389331952.0,"This is not a tradition steeped in hard logic, so I'd caution against trying to use logic if you want to understand, ok?

Imagine this: you own a home for 10 years, know your neighbors, maintain and take pride in your property. You have, on many occasions, discussed how rude it is that every time it snows that cars from different blocks pile into your street and stay for days on end, after you dug your spot out while it was still snowing. So now, you need to park blocks away from your house in a spot that no one bothered to clear out. It's obvious if they'd taken out some time and shoveled out these spots, the homeowner would not need to go through the hassle of parking so far away from their house. This happens every single year. 

I'm sure it goes against being Mr. Popular, but be honest: would you not develop a sort of animosity toward people for doing this? Homeowners associate the spot in front of their house as being ""theirs."" They maintain it year round, clean the muck out of the gutter in the fall, spray it down when it gets muddy in the spring and summer, and shovel it out when it's winter. I'm not saying it's theirs, only that they have a sense of ownership over that spot. 

And homeowners on the same block that have built relationships with each other tend to respect that it is their spot because they feel the same about the spot in front of their house that they maintain. 

If these people lived on a block where it was hard to find parking year round, they might not feel such a claim on the parking spot. But if you notice every single year that cars migrate to your block only when it snows, thus making the homeowner do their share and someone else's share, yeah...out comes the tacky patio furniture.

Edited to add this point: I am only explaining the way things went on my block when I was growing up. There might be people out there who try to claim a spot in densely populated areas of the city but I haven't seen it myself. Seems incredibly silly to dibs out a spot in, say, lincoln park or wicker park...pfft...good luck with that. "

AFormidableContender,confession,1389332003.0,"&gt;I'm not entirely sure how getting a life threatening disease is ever an ""awesome ratio"". Luckily, HIV positive people can live almost normal lifespans these days. Still, it's not a fun disease to have.

Getting a disease was not a result of him having sex with 80 women. He got the disease because he had unprotected sex with one woman. He was unlucky. 

&gt;And this is the problem with the Red Pill. Why are some men so angry about not having sex, that they turn into extremist bigots, hating all women.

This is possibly the stupidest question I've ever heard, with all due respect. 

If you starve and beat your dog, your dog will no longer have a particularly high opinion of you...

&gt;Yes, it is. You can't claim that the Red Pill has made it possible for men to have many sexual partners.

Yes I can. 

&gt;Genghis Khan had 1000 children

Genghis Khan was a man of extreme power who either raped or took the women captive. 

&gt;Mick Jagger has had sex with 4,000 women

Mick Jagger is a ludicrously famous, and rich rock star. 

&gt;Neither of them are Red Pillers.

Yes they are, actually. They live by the definition of TRP. It's ironic that you'd use them as examples because they are literally what TRP says....I'm not sure why you think a raping, pillaging, Mongol who raised an army and destroyed countries from the 1200's is a good example of men not dominating women for sex. 

&gt;One guy sleeping with 80 women does not prove any success of the theory. And even if it does, it's still sexual fascism.

Demonstrate in any meaningful way, how using a theory to attract women, and radically (and I mean radically) improving your success does not demonstrate that the method, at the very least works, regardless if there are some innacuracies. 

&gt;And even if it does, it's still sexual fascism.

First, define sexual fascism, and how TRP fits that definition. 

Second, why would anyone give a fuck about sexual fascism?

You've literally told me yourself that you have privilege up the ass and then some and if you couldn't pay your rent, you could sucker one of your male friends into paying it for you because they're weak beta males. I'm sure you take advantage of getting into clubs free, and having men pay for your drinks. Getting jobs you don't deserve, because you're good looking, etc. Most women in your position don't give a fuck about sexual fascism...why should men?"

One of the reasons I suggest adhering it to the glass is that it's much easier to clean adhesive off glass than the door frame when it does eventually fail.

The foam weatherstripping I linked you to is angled, so if you align it in the correct direction, that should help some.  If you are gentle with the door, you may get a year or more out of it.

This also depends on having the gap match the width of the strip.  Too wide, and it won't help.  Too narrow, and it'll pull off the first time.

SSID is the broadcast name of the access point. Generally in unsecured wireless, the SSID will be ""Netgear-12345"" or something else just as obvious. I can't recall what this access point was renamed to, but it wasn't very complimentary. 

It's an easy thing to fix if you have physical access to the device, you just need to hit the factory reset button, however the fact that it was still in a modified state 10 odd years after being hacked is a clear indication that the owner of the device has no idea it happened in the first place.

HumanSockPuppet,TheRedPill,1389332567.0,"&gt;This gives me so much rage. The only reason ever why a woman can find you attractive is that you are getting attention from other women and she is seeing it. There's nothing inherent in your qualities, nothing to improve. It's the jealousy, that makes her love you.

Exactly. Which is why it is pointless to get mad about it.

**You're not really mad at women.** Yes, women's idiosyncracies frustrate you, I don't doubt it. No one here does. But you're not mad at *them*...you're mad at the lies you've been fed all your life.

You're mad because you were living your life around a theory that made sense to your rational male mind. **But now, you're being assailed from all sides by EVIDENCE (which your rational male mind cannot ignore) of a truth which MAKES NO SENSE.**

It's infuriating. It's baffling. It's enough to drive a man to nihilism.

And it will pass.

No one here holds these feelings against you. Fuck, we've all felt it. An anger that makes you clench your teeth so hard you're afraid they'll shatter.

But it will pass.

What replaces that anger will be a smug, self-satisfaction as you embrace the truth. You will grow comfortable with it. You will behave in ways that you never imagined you could - your old self wouldn't recognize you. 

You'll be self-serving. You will pursue your own agenda over anyone else's. You'll be avaricious and ambitious. You'll get your way more often than not.  You'll be cold and distant to all of the women you're casually fucking - and they'll hate and love you for it. They're curse their inability to pull their pussies away from you, but they'll cling desperately to whatever scraps of attention you feed them.

**You must understand: as a whole, women are weak.** So weak, in fact, that most of them can't help what they are. They lack the self-discipline and willpower to change themselves in any significant way. This is why they depend on men in almost everything. **They are subject to OUR whims, not the other way around.**

Your wrath is a precious fuel. You needn't waste another drop of it on the fickle, adolescent whims of females. Their desires are immaterial, at least until one of them makes it a point to ingratiate herself to you - **at which point you can treat her kindly out of pride, instead of a sense of obligation.**

Save your wrath for the real challenges in your life."

Every person on reddit who hates on fat people has their own issues they are struggling with or perhaps not addressing at all. The only difference is that their struggles are not visible to the naked eye.

I agree that a big part of the obesity problem is parents who teach their kids bad habits. My own parents did this. They are great parents and in almost every other aspect raised me right. But they liked to eat. And so I learned to like to eat. The funny thing is that they didn't give us crappy food either. My mom was a cook and made healthy meals every night. But we ate more than we should. I ate the same portions my parents ate, which was too much for my 5'0"" frame. We also would go out for special occasions, so I began to associate eating with ""happy family times."" So then when I became unhappy I turned to...what else? Food.

My parents instilled some bad habits. But lots of parents instill lots of bad habits in people. I'd say every parent has screwed up their kid in *some* way. All these people who love to point fingers at fat people and say, ""they make so many excuses! Why don't they just fix themselves?"" are ignoring the fact that there are aspects of themselves they should be fixing too."

What you're actually saying is that those who struggle as of no choice of there own should struggle even more whilst those who succeed easily or are above average should be given more support that they don't need as there's no guarantee they'll do anything with their lives post high school. 

By your same principle of thinking the rich should get richer and the poor should be charged for being poor.

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1389332624.0,"&gt;I don't think though that feminism poisoned moms are specifically raising their sons to be beta. If that were true then before feminism existed there shouldn't have been so many beta men.

There weren't. 

There's a difference between a beta who is **content** to be beta, and beta who is beta out of pure necessity; he's beta because he is not yet alpha, and he may never be, but he strives to be better than he currently is by masculine standards.

&gt; And in 2010, as the Walton’s wealth has risen and most other Americans’ wealth declined, it is now the case that the Walton family wealth is as large as the bottom 48.8 million families in the wealth distribution (constituting 41.5 percent of all American families) combined.

I suspect what you might find is that you owe the USDA fee whether you pay it to through bank or not, and if you don't pay it, then the USDA will come after you, regardless of the agreement you have with the bank.

Whatever, I pick my battles.  But she had this weird obsession with using the brand of soap she preferred.  I used the same brand, but apple honey scented.  She made a big deal of going out and buying her own soap and would fight me on it.  Then she would bathe him while I was at work or in the shower against my wishes so that I couldn't pick the soap.  After a whole shit load of things I had not really stood up for myself on, I finally did.  Over soap.  I finally said, ""Did he come out of YOUR vagina?""  (My plan was to say ""then you can't choose his soap!"" when she said no.)  But to my chagrin, she said, ""Yes!""  It took me a second to collect my thoughts and assess what had just happened.  I went off, telling her I was PRETTY FREAKING SURE that I had gone through that particular hell and that I was *there* when it happened, while she laughed at me.  Finally she said, ""Well, my son came from my vagina and your son came from him, so it's basically the same.""  I told her that when my boy actually came from *her*, she could choose his soap, and that she was welcome to try and force my husband to use whatever soap she wanted.  I wished her luck with that.

After that I resorted to stealing her soap and hiding it.

And now I get to deal with her acting like I'm a deadbeat mom just because I go to law school and work, even though I spend nearly every second I'm home and my son is awake with him.  And, of course, her constant criticisms of my perfect little monster."

Namelis1,vndiscuss,1389333091.0,"I'm a bit late to the party, but I'll write out my thoughts anyway to keep pace. Then I'll read what the rest of you people wrote down. Also we'll be playing anime and VN cliche bingo.

So:

Grisaia no Kajitsu.

**Translation** - The VN seems to be very well translated, lacking the staggered sentence structure that is usually so common. Lets hope this quality persists.

**Technical** - It's nice to have a VN in glorious widescreen. The engine seems middle of the range. The character sprites are, again, middle of the range for a VN. Just your generic bishoujo spritework. I bet they buy those in bulk somewhere.

**Music** - The VN doesn't seem to have a musical track of any significance. Sounds really like what you'd find on a shit eroge. Just generic piano music to drown out the embarrassing silence of playing a Japanese porn game. I hope I'm wrong in the future.

**First impressions** - I sort of like the MC. Usual mopey VN blank - self-insertion-masturbation protagonist ( **B!** ) ( so deep and edgy,[ he doesn't want to get close to people because they'll hate him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXYiU_JCYtU)) but at least the man is gifted with a sharp wit and most of the things that come out of his mouth are amusing.

**Cast first impressions.** - Oh boy. On first impressions at least three of the five are your usual moeblobs. 

The loli tsundere ( **I!** ) for tsundere stereotype (I chose steriotype and not archetype for a reason) fans. 

The cat loli ( **N!** ) who refers to you as Onii-san (**G!**) - who manages to please both the older brother roleplay and the cat loli fetishists at the same time. 

Then there's the maid cosplayer? ( **O! BINGO!** ) Who's either brain damaged or she's acutely aware that she's in a VN and wants to just get it over quickly. Hell she even gives the MC her sizes once he asks her for it. I like her in that case. 

Then there's miss box cutter who hates people. I suspect her arc might be kind of predictable. I can't decide if her character is misogynist or misandrist. Women cant harm men. They're weak and frail things. Her threatening you with a box cutter is just her way of warming up to you. I know I'm reading too much into this but I always find the culture-clash/shit writing aspect of VN's fascinating.

And then there's Amane who is the only one who's name I managed to remember because she seems like the only sane person out of the cast. Quickly taking advantage of Yuuji by leverage of her tits. And then doing the same thing to everyone in town. I like her. The banter between her and the MC is fun as well.

**Setting and story** - Stop me if you heard this one: A male character whose parents are dead (**B!** Yes I'm doing this gag twice), transfers to a special academy (**I!**). 

Actually this is the first time where the MC and the harem have the entire academy for themselves. Screw it. No side characters. Okay, principal character. One side character. But screw drawing and writing those pesky classmates. Teachers? Screw that too that too. We'll just fade to black for the lessons. So that's kind of new in setting the bar lower I guess. But it's new.

Also the cast wont shut up about Yuuji's dead sister, so I'm guessing that is going to be a major plot point. Maybe one of the girls is actually his long lost sister (i**N!**cest). 

Not sure what to make of this one. Looks like a generic romance/eroge VN. It doesn't seem to be awful enough to be worth a ""laugh at it"" reading. So I hope it picks up the pace by the next /r/vndiscuss writeup.

Lavender-Peony,AskWomen,1389333140.0,"&gt; Some may think this is oversimplifying things, and that as a girl from a privileged background I don't have a right to judge. I don't care, I'm judging anyways. 

Holy shit. Holy. Shit.

You are reeking of privilege, you know, and you don't even care.

&gt; But I would never ever ever volunteer for a job that involved killing people because I was in debt or didn't know what else to do with myself. It's basically saying that boredom and money are perfectly good reasons for violence and war. 

Boredom? Money? What do you think life is like for people who aren't you? Do you have any idea?

The military has a ton of people in it who are undereducated and come from poor backgrounds, people who have grown up in abusive households and who feel they have no future, people with few opportunities.

You seem to think that ""money"" means, I don't know, iPhones or something (I'm sure that's what it means for you) when for something people it literally means *having a roof over their head* or *medication for their family* or *food that isn't from a food bank*. Do you know that some people join the military because they have responsibilities and don't have the same opportunities as you do? Like the 19-year-old with a pregnant girlfriend, or the 20-year-old with the mentally ill wife who can't afford health insurance?

Not everybody lives in your cozy little world. And entering the military does not mean what you think it means. Yes, sometimes you end up in combat and sometimes that turns into actually having to kill people. And when that happens, it fucks people up. But it really doesn't't happen very much. Most people are never in a situation where they have to take a life. But the people joining the army didn't start the war. And some of them are assholes, but so many of them are just *people* who are trying to function in the world that exists. They didn't create the circumstances. Yet you want to blame them.

&gt; It's a little sick that the US government requires many of our young people to participate in mass violence before it will support their education.

Yeah. It is. It really fucking is. Yet you manage to gloss over this point and turn right back to: it's the individual, underprivileged people who are trying to grasp at a life with even a fraction of the privilege you've had cradling you from day one -- but **fuck them any way**.

You think you're being thoughtful for the people in the invaded countries, or the victims of U.S. military attacks and drone strikes -- and they sure as hell need support -- but instead you're blaming and shaming victims of a fucked-up system from your sweet little position of privilege. *And you know it.* And you say you don't care.

That's sick."

Some of the advanced functions have the ability to save an enormous amounts of time (i.e. budget) than traditional methods.  Stuff like alignments and pipe networks are the quickest way to get a feel for what Civil 3D has to offer with dynamic objects/tables/labels/styles/etc.   


Youtube videos are probably the best option as it is free and readily available.  Also online Civil3D community forms (AUGI, Autodesk, etc.).  However there is no silver bullet to learning it.  As I said it is a continuous learning exercise.  Please for the sake of anybody who works with you that uses Civil 3D understand what ""styles"" are in Civil 3D.

Being young a had yet to learn to fall correctly and led with my forehead.  I landed right on the nail and drove it into my skull.  I pushed myself up right away and felt the nail drag through the bone.  My parents took me to the hospital and the doctor told us how lucky I was. The nail had stopped about a quarter of an inch short of doing any really serious damage and since I was so young the hole in my skull would close pretty quickly.

I've been trying to overcome the fear so I was doing a lot of reflection on my past and trying to figure out when I started being scared of them. I had remembered playing with daddy long legs and not being scared and now those freak me out too.

When I thought about it I realized that it was because my dad is arachnaphobic. Here is this guy that, as a child, he was a super hero to me. There was nothing he was afraid of, nothing that ever upset him, not a single fuck given over basically anything. And spiders freaked him the fuck out. Like, he would run out of a room scared of them. So I thought, ""What sort of creepy shit can these little bastards do that my ironman of a father is scared shitless by them?""

If you want to pat yourself on the back for being a naysayer, go ahead, but you're still wrong. 

I don't know what the problems with this team are exactly (I've got plenty of opinions), but they're not named Grabovski, Macarthur, Clarkson and Corsi. 

For example, the Corsi argument goes something like ""the Leafs play a stupid system that gives up too many shots while not taking enough shots which statistically correlates with poor performance, therefore they suck.""

Problem is, this team isn't playing any kind of system. So to say their system is the problem misses the point.  There is no system to evaluate against the stats. The argument over Corsi hasn't been won at all. (Which isn't to say I think possession isn't a very important part of the game, just that Corsi is stupid).

ClearlySituational,Warthunder,1389333621.0,"&gt;No, I know exactly what it gives. And that doesn't make up for how easy it is for an enemy plane to point up at a diving XP-50, taking the plane to stall, and murder the XP-50 in less time than it takes the XP-50 to murder the other plane.

I'm sorry, but you're a fucking moron if you get shot down by those people. If they do that, you know what you do? Fly in circles over them, then dive the fuck down when they're stuck in a stall. It's not difficult if you've got an IQ above 50. 

&gt;No player is good enough to dictate 100% how a game will play out, and this advantage is awarded to every plane that can seize it, the XP-50 is no exception.

That point kind of rides off of the one above. And the answer is: Yes. You are in charge of nearly 99.99% of engagements, BECAUSE YOU OUT CLIMB EVERYBODY. Take out the highest aircraft, then move down, and you'll never deal with opposition. It's.Not.Complicated. 


&gt; Oh boy, one whole kill per battle. **Or I could be in a K-4 or G-10 and pull 4 kills per battle.** Yup, XP-50 is totally fine, it can get 1 kill per battle. Even the F8F-1B with its horribly shittastic flight model is better than the XP-50.

Bullshit, it's fucking impossible to do that unless you either A: go after AI, or B: are extremely lucky. 

And I said ""at least."" Are you aware what ""at"" and ""least"" combined mean? If not, let me give you a short explafuckingnation. It means, 1 or more. That's pretty good to see rando's pull that EVERY RB GAME I SEE IT IN. 

&gt;Except that this plane is a horrible piece of shit

That's bullshit, see point above. If this plane is shit to you, then you are likely very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, VERY bad at this game.

Hence why greater the depth and the smaller the market, the more expensive the books are.  Even used, many larger books on graduate level theoretical mathematics will still run you $200-300 online (as opposed to $300-400 new).  Much of this material really *doesn't* exist online, so the textbook's value is real.

As for the buy back schemes, they are a racket, but not one you have to participate in.  You can easily resell to the next class or on ebay for a much higher price.  For many of these books though, I kept them as reference.  Hopefully I won't need to look up proofs too often in my current job, but having that book probably makes me the only person on my team (or even at my company) who even has access to that knowledge."

You are not alone in this situation.  It is a big issue with a lot of legal backing.

I would try to approach your teacher politely yet firmly and state that you are not able to dissect animals due to ethical beliefs.  Come with literature and alternatives.  If there is balking, bring up your legal right for an alternative.  If there is still balking, move up the chain.

Don't use a lawyer, in one weekend you can fill out the paperwork that the lawyer would make you do, and save a grand in lawyer fees. I just did bankruptcy and had over 50k discharged.  
  
Sure it will prevent you from buying a new car or house for 7 years, but who cares about that. Cash based going forward. Bike. Rethink your income priorities. Joining the military or teaching ESL for 2,000 a month in income and $500 a month in expenses or being an officer in the military at 60,000 a year and no living costs could all help the income side, after the bankruptcy that is.

- Don't squeeze too hard, obviously some guys like a more firm grip than others, but don't overdo it.  Try making a tight fist right now like you're going to punch someone.  Never squeeze it like that

3. It equates veganism with minimalism.  That is exactly the opposite idea that should be put out there.  The problem is that most non-vegans picture vegans living off of carrots and air.  That veganism is this ascetic diet of deprivation.  We should be emphasizing how complex and decadent veganism can be.

duckface08,canada,1389334495.0,"I'm wondering about a few things.

A discharge from E.R. at any time is not too unusual, and if Mr. Silver was stable and living independently (i.e. not in an assisted living facility, but in his own home) he and the staff probably figured he was good to go. It is unfortunate, however, that he had so few support systems in place in the community to ensure he would be ok once he left the hospital and that this was not identified when he was assessed (an elderly man coming in alone and not able to secure a ride from family should instantly raise a red flag).

I would still question why the staff did not at least help him find warm clothes to wear. -37 temperature isn't exactly PJ-and-slippers weather, even if you're just going from a taxi to your home. I remember discharging a patient home once who had no money, no coat, and no shoes; it wasn't even as cold as -37 but the social worker was able to scrounge up an extra old coat and pair of shoes and we got her a taxi slip. Still, since Mr. Silver was not actually admitted to the hospital as an in-patient, he wasn't taking up a bed or anything, therefore could he not have waited another few hours in the E.R. waiting room until someone in his family could pick him up? It isn't exactly the most comfortable place to stay, though, so perhaps Mr. Silver just wanted to return home ASAP and made the decision himself to leave.

I'm also wondering about his family. According to the article, they don't live nearby. However, if my elderly relative (or even if it was any relative or friend, no matter their age) was being seen in a hospital, I'd want to know about it and would be keeping tabs to make sure that they're ok. This would be especially true if I knew he did not have anyone else to rely on nearby. But from their quotes in the article, as /u/RationalArgumentMan said, it was as if they were close enough to know all the details of what went on between Mr. Silver, the hospital, and the taxi driver. I think only the taxi driver would be able to tell us what went on after Mr. Silver left the hospital.

Lastly, the article states that Mr. Silver unfortunately died of a heart attack. How could anyone have predicted that? Even if he had made it through the door of his home, he still could have had the heart attacked, collapsed, and died. It is very unfortunate but I don't think anyone can blame the hospital for at least that part of the situation.

tl;dr there is too much missing information to really know the whole situation."

Lavender-Peony,AskWomen,1389334585.0,"&gt; and the fact that you're volunteering to go somewhere and kill people means you're probably a violent sociopath. 

You *have* to know that's not true, that sociopath is a real thing and that most people in the military do not fit that description. Yet you say it anyway.

I get it. You're a saint. If a person you loved more than anybody was severely depressed, but affordable treatment is impossible to come by where you live, and you're stuck in a financial hole you're not sure you'll ever get out of because of a shitty life you were placed in, and you know that all that could be better if you take the tiny chance that you might end up in military combat and the even tinier chance, somebody might die at your hands -- you, you sweet, perfect human being, would say no. You'd say I'm not a violent sociopath! And the world would applaud your bravery and your kindness and your gentle soul.

But some people make different choices. Some people go into the military, take care of their family, get an education, pay off debt, and leave -- without ever even coming close to harming a single person -- some people *never even leave* the U.S. (I think a huge problem here is you have no idea how the U.S. military functions and you have some fantasy idea that you sign up for military, get shipped to Afghanistan with a gun and set free -- nope) -- to a bigger, brighter future where their children won't end up in a situation as fucked up as they were. But you're right. ""Violent sociopath"" is definitely what that person is! What a sicko. Nothing like you, oh gentle soul!

Yeah, the U.S. is fucked up. It's fucked up that that's a choice people have to make. But when you blame the service members for it, when you make hasty half-assed diagnoses intended only to demean, *you're* behaving in a very, very fucked up way."

A man can go through with a marriage ceremony with ~~a pillow~~ **another man**, but it doesn't change anything with regards to the law.

Those are the arguments I currently see people make against same-sex marriage, and I don't understand how yours is fundamentally different. You merely draw the line on what 'marriage' means to you at a different point to other people.

LEGEND and LORE: Sapphire has been associated with divine favor. The Buddhists believed that the sapphire favored devotion and spiritual enlightenment. It is the birthstone for the month of September:

""A maiden born when autumn leaves
Are rustling in September's breeze.
A Sapphire on her brow should bind;
'Twill cure diseases of the mind. (5)

MAGICAL PROPERTIES: The ancient Greeks linked sapphire with Apollo, and wore it as an aid to prophecy when consulting oracles. For this reason, it is considered an aid for developing the ""third eye"". It was also considered to be able to guard its owner from being captured. It is worn and utilized in rituals to strengthen the ability to tap and send forth power.

HEALING: Sapphire has been use as an aide to healing ailments of the eyes. It is also considered a booster for the immune system, protecting the body in general from disease.

satin_pajamas,AskMen,1389335383.0,"We're a society built on freedom. We tend to think that if you decide you want to do something, the only thing stopping you from doing it should be you. (Of course taking into account laws and whatnot) 

When you put barriers in front of people our natural tendency is to challenge those barriers. Take womens sports as an example. Not that long ago it wasn't really a thing. Then it became a thing and people were happy because equality. Some sports take to it better than others. Tennis is a pretty good example where popularity is relatively equal. Whereas the WNBA is on life support.

So when you place a barrier in front of someone, say the military, people take it as a personal offense. ""I can do that too."" But really, they can't.

The problem is they think they should have the chance to prove they can. But the chance to prove they can in a military situation costs lives. 

We're taught that when we count a group of people out, we're just being stupid and ignorant, and then we're shown that they could actually do it all along. But physically, Men vs Women statistically proves we're not wrong. 

Every sport, every Olympic event, every physical challenge, Men put up faster times, higher scores, longer distances, etc. That's not to say there aren't some women out there who could kick my ass at such and such sport. But I'm not a professional.

What it really comes down to is ""fairness."" Perhaps our highest and most important value in western culture, is freedom. When something you have no control over prevents you from doing something, it's seen as discrimination and unfair. Just look at how far some people take that argument. Boys joining the girl scouts, girls joining the boy scouts. We have had to decide as a society where and when to draw the line, and it's pretty damn far out there."

Strong left hand grip, soft right to guide, and a jumbo (size below biggest super stroke) grip on the putter transformed my putting. Once you have your stroke consistent, it made my game so much better. Shot my best ever 3 weeks after doing this, a 64, and having this string will help you do it.

People don't tend to understand that for a relationship like that to work there needs to be mutual love, trust and respect.


It's not paranoia assuming that her beliefs don't carry over into the real world. It's trying to maintain a little respect and hope for humanity. If you truly believe that women are subservient to men, then all the more power to you. I believe that people should have the right to lead the life they choose. I actually identify with feminism. I have no problem with women choosing to remain stay-at-home moms or wives. I have a problem with it if your husband beats you or cheats on you and you think it's ok because ""he's a man and thats what men do."" Because it's not something that should be common place or accepted.


I worship my Dom. I truly do. I will kneel at his feet, I will bow to him, I will serve him drinks and cook him food and crawl around on the ground for him if that is what he wants. I will spend 30 minutes worshiping his body with my mouth like I did last time I was with him.

feedmahfish,askscience,1389335570.0,"&gt;I'm tempted to add that it needs to displace some other species in order to be invasive. We don't normally consider primary/secondary succession to be invasive.

I honestly don't like the idea that an invasive needs to ""displace"" another species for the reason that displacement is not limited to invasion.  In fact, species displace themselves without invasion.  We call that migration.  I don't think we should include the concept of species displacement because then an invasive species is not considered such if it's not displacing others... even though it clearly is invading a new niche.  For example, carps have invaded many streams in the US.  But it clearly didn't displace any species in some streams mainly because there was either enough resources in the habitat or there was a niche available to occupy/co-occupy.  So would you consider it non-invasive in just those streams?  I don't feel comfortable with the idea of including it in there.  I actually consider primary and secondary succession to be invasion by the very definition.  The species was absent, and now it's taking over.  An invasion doesn't have to be necessarily a bad thing as it connotes.  In fact, biological invasions are critical for species to survive if habitats become restricted, which they do from time to time."

...Say what? I've only gone shooting once when my step brother who is in the military encouraged me to, and I was only able to hit a soda can from ~20 feet with half the shots out of a 9mm carbine. He said that he was impressed for it being my first time and that the reason I missed was because my trigger pull was incorrect and causing the barrel to angle slightly to the right before shooting. So I have a hard time believing that if you handed me a rifle, even a modern one much better built than a Mosin, that I'd be able to hit a target at 600 yards ""very accurately.""

*Face palm*...

I forgot how good you are at missing the point. My reference was to A) being starved for something you desperately need, and B) being rejected often...

&gt;He was a rapist, and a brutal dictator. I used him as an example of how having many sexual partners is not a new concept. Obviously, he's not someone to strive towards.

Then the point is meaningless as TRP isn't saying having a lot of sexual partners is **new**, it's saying it's possible to do without having to BE a brutal rapist dictator, or rock star...

&gt;And, he was very attractive when he was young. Handsome, tall and thin, talented, good voice. It's not even about the money or fame.

This is all irrelavent. 

&gt;Neither of them fit the definition. Genghis Khan is a rapist (I explained above why I mentioned him), and Mick Jagger is someone who has had many sexual partners long before any shitty Red Pill theory.
I think it's quite obvious that I'm not endorsing rape and murder. Just making a historic timeline of sex. Though I can see how that was confusing.

Again, for, like, the third time, this is not a logically coherent counter-argument. 

Basis of discussion: 

***~~:The Red Pill helps men get sex***

     *~~:Your counter argument: TRP is bad because [A) it's sexual fascism, B) it doesn't help men get sex]*

     *~~~:Your supporting argument: because rock stars and mass murdering rapist conquers had a lot of sex, all men can have a lot of sex, and therefore, TRP is incorrent/uncessary:*

How is this argument logically consistent in the slightest...? I'm getting the distinct impression you don't actually **know** what TRP teaches....?

&gt;I don't see how it improves anyone's success. I can tell when people are playing those stupid games, and I won't go near them.

If you can see when people are ""playing stupid games"" and therefore ""won't go near them"", they are noobs who haven't figured out how to do them correctly in the first place. This argument is old, tired, and oxymoronic.

&gt;You take the key points of fascism, and apply them to sex. The whole obsession with value, social hierarchy, exploiting others.

Which is necessarily incorrect...because.....?

[*keep in mind you're a self proclaimed very attractive woman about to give an argument as to why the theory of social value is wrong, which is inherently hypocritical*]

&gt;I do not ask men to buy things for me. I would never allow a man to pay my rent, buy me free stuff, or anything like that.

No, but you've stated you could/can if you so pleased. 

&gt;I am an intelligent, creative, well educated person with a wide range of skills on my résumé. Every job I've had, I earned, and was just as qualified, if not more, than everyone else there.

People bent over backwards to impress you. Your life is no more a result purely of your own efforts as Michaelangelo's *David* is it's curator's and restorer's. 

&gt;It's not my fault some guys are attracted to me, so any guy who is resentful about that should really reevaluate their perspective. And no, it's not much of a privilege. My life is not much different than anyone else's.

It most certainly is. Ironically, TRP exists precisely because people like *you* think *that*."

Right, but my point was that we were also ranked 18th for yards, which also probably benefited from teams racking up huge leads and then playing conservatively for the rest of the game... as well as teams starting drives already in our territory. Were we 31st best defense? Probably not. Were we 18th? No. Probably somewhere in between because both stats were skewed by the worst special teams in the league. However, it's still a defense that sucked. Not 31st sucked, but not far off.

Novel research means new directions taken with an idea or hypothesis.  In otherwords, it's impossible to discover something new without acknowledging what has been built upon before.  Nobody goes around and says ""I found this brand new physical element of the universe"" and doesn't put a citation forward.  Think about what I just said:  to discover something new, you need a citation.  What does that mean?

It means that if you discover something new, it needs context for it to be useful and to make sense.  Where do you get this context?  From the old literature.  It's at this point where it becomes novel research.  You found this particular finding: does it match up with the theory or detract from it and is an exception?  Point is, nobody found it except you.  And now you can say, ""hey I found the ball falls down just like gravity predicted, but if you turn on this electrical switch, it falls *up* counter to gravity.""  That's a novel finding because we based this finding in the context of the theory on gravity and all of it's research and that this stupid electrical switch is some exception to the rule.  That's a novel finding quite frankly and it truly is.  Why?  Because nobody discovered it.  

If nothing was truly novel, nothing would be exciting and science would be quite boring.  We think of novel research as ideas explored where people didn't have opportunity or didn't think to.  And we stand on the shoulders of giants because it is with their help that just maybe we can reach the stars where they could not and find something new."

Yes.

I'm not saying anything. I'm stating a generality in my world view, that I believe is a correct interpretation of reality, that contradicts your world view.

duckface08,AskWomen,1389336113.0,"I only ever was on an online dating site for maybe a couple of weeks. I deleted my profile after just that amount of time not because of rude/offensive messages, but more because I found I just wasn't into it and didn't feel like keeping up with the messages and such.

Anyway, for the most part, I received copy+paste type messages, like, ""Hey, what's up?"" Honestly, I ignored these. Thankfully, I never received a dick pic but I did get a few random shots of chests/abs.

I remember one guy whose first message was actually kind of sweet, but subsequent messages came on *way* too strong too fast - the gist I got from it is he basically wanted to know what I wanted out of a relationship, like if I wanted to get married and things like that. I think that was his 2nd message to me, after I responded to his first. His profile also screamed desperate. I don't know if I can put it into words, but I just had a bad feeling from it all.

Surprisingly, the most memorable message I received was from another woman. I had clearly stated in my profile that I'm into men, but she messaged me anyway and said that even if I wasn't into women, she thought I sounded like an interesting person and perhaps we could be friends.

There was also another guy that I chatted with for a bit who seemed genuinely nice and funny. I had listed baking as amongst my hobbies, and he said something like, ""I like baking too! We should have a cake baking contest.""

EnergyCritic,AskFeminists,1389336190.0,"&gt;That being said, to me the '97% of rapists are walking free' is a bald-faced lie

Actually, it would be more accurate to call it an ""exaggeration"", but your statement here clearly is an exaggeration as well. The fact is that many rapists go free -- the rate is up for debate here due to the flimsiness of RAINN's infograph. 

It's hard to tell what RAINN is interpreting from these statistics (just check out the actual documents they reference) and it would take some work to figure out how they extrapolated those statistics. You really can't say if they're wrong or not unless you review the data in detail, but I'm willing to write their conclusions off as sensational after reviewing the data for a bit. 

Clearly, the significance of the issue is, however, not up for debate.

&gt;With that being said, my question to all of you is whether my encounters with these problems are common in the wider feminist world from the small corner I've seen.

Pretty much every interest group skews data in its favor. Feminist organizations are, unfortunately, no exception. It doesn't make what they do okay, but this is not a problem solely within feminism. From my perspective as a member of the educated elite, I am always irritated by organizations that skew information in their favor, but so long as they are not completely lying about the data, then I can't entirely blame them -- or any organization -- for trying, despite how frustrating it is. 

The imperative for an activist organization to compete to justify its existence within our current system of non-profit organizing makes it almost necessary to exaggerate one's issue just to keep getting money. It's sad, but it's the nature of our system.

&gt;I'm questioning the worth of using these figures in accomplishing that goal. 

You gave one concrete example. The others are off-hand comments you have heard here or there, but it's not enough for you to declare an epidemic in the feminist community regarding using faulty statistics.

Have you ever heard the saying ""99% percent of statistics are made up on the spot""? It is common for humans to incompletely recall information and instead of refraining from bringing it up, they mush it together with some half-truth and exaggeration just so they have something to say. 

Looking up above here, it appears you have even done some of that yourself. What a coincidence!

&gt;I believe RAINN is doing this same thing.

I would rather you be able to *prove* them wrong. ""Believing"" they are lying about statistics and pressing the issue as if it is fact is just about the same level of incompetence of which you are accusing them."

satin_pajamas,AskMen,1389336512.0,"Remember that the popular perception of rape is inaccurate. Most of the time, Women don't just get dragged down some dark alleyway and raped. Those are rare cases, much like murder. Outside of the serial killers and mass murders, people don't kill people they don't know.

Rape generally happens within social circles. So this image of the violent attacker descending upon a random woman is pretty far fetched. It's much more nuanced than that. ""Afraid to say no"" situations. Date rape. Drunk or under the influence rape. Things like that. Where his word vs her word is about as far as the evidence goes.

So when the story of her going on a few dates, going home with him, going into his house, and then being afraid to say no, begs the question ""Well what the hell were you thinking?"" It's not a claim of no wrong doing. It's like a guy who leaves his garage open and his car keys in the ignition getting his car stolen. Really he did nothing wrong, but steps could have been taken to avoid this because there are in fact bad people in the world, and nothing we do will ever change that.

I also think it is a gender split thing. Women see rape in one way, obviously, and men in another. It's a thing we both have to worry about but in different ways. Men worry about vindictive rape claims. Women worry about actual rape. If I meet a crazy enough girl who decides she hates me, she can pull an ""afraid to say no"" case out and I have basically no defense and it becomes a battle of he said she said. Plus, regardless of case outcome, my professional career is in the toilet. My personal life is destroyed. It is literally a life ruining charge that is scarily easy to drop."

My mother said she put me and my brother in our car seats, and since it wasn't safe in the house due to after shocks we waited it out in the car. After shocks would come, bounce the car down the driveway and once the car was about to enter the street, mom would start the car, drive it back up to the top and park it. Rinse and repeat. 

Many years later, about 7 years ago my family was back in Yucca Valley, where we had the Earthquake. We were right next door to the Saw Tooth fire. 

Yucca Valley is well, a valley. You get used to wild fires even if you've only been back somewhere for two years. From our front porch you could see a ridge about a mile away and the fire trying to get over it. We just sat on the porch drinking tea watching the fire crews work. 

I remember this conversation: 

Mom, to my father: ""Should we pack our shit? Just in case?"" 

Dad: "" If the fire actually makes it down the hill we'll worry."" **Takes a long sip of his tea**

Lord Victor Nefarius: Get up little Red Wyrm, and destroy them!
Aggro:


Too late...friends. Nefarius' corruption has taken hold. I cannot...control myself. I beg you Mortals, flee! Flee before I lose all sense of control. The Black Fire rages within my heart. I must release it! FLAME! DEATH! DESTRUCTION! COWER MORTALS BEFORE THE WRATH OF LORD....NO! I MUST FIGHT THIS! ALEXSTRASZA, HELP ME! I MUST FIGHT!""

Nefarius' hate has made me stronger than ever before. You should have fled, while you could, mortals! The fury of Blackrock courses through my veins!


Killing a player:

Forgive me (player), your death only adds to my failure.
Note: With sound on you can hear him say ""Forgive me friend, your death only adds to my failure.""

LevyWife,TwoXChromosomes,1389337006.0,"have you ever watched Super Nanny? they talk about the time out thing with kids a lot. kids love testing boundaries, and if you put them in time out but let them just get up and go back to playing right away, that teaches them they can get away with anything and that you're not serious about discipline. you can still instill discipline without involving spanking, but it does take some extra time and effort, and a hell of a lot of patience. I believe in the show she has the parents place the kid in time out, and if the kid leaves before the time is up they're instructed to take the kid back and make them sit again, and not say anything to them in the process. the kids usually see it as a game because they'll run and then the parents have to chase and bring them back, but eventually the kids get tired and give up, and they'll stay in time out for as long as they need to. it's a matter of who gives up first, and every time the parent gives up, it just reinforces the bad behaviors. when time out's over the parents are instructed to get down on eye level with the child, ask them if they know/explain to them why they were in time out, then have them apologize and give them a hug before letting them go. it seems to work pretty well if you're consistent enough, and if you threaten time out you have to follow through with it."

I think that you might be right in saying that they were brought to the dark world as guardians, or as potential hosts. It seems that powerful/larger creatures might be difficult for the Ing to possess, as the Chykka is possessed several times in its adult form (when it becomes ""dark"") but the Ing is subsequently kicked out when the host receives too much damage...maybe the creatures were possessed multiple times so that they built up a resistance to the darkness and its corrupted environment?

&gt; I'm not sure why the manosphere accepts Austrian school economics, but I'm pretty sure it's because thats where the idea of free markets and value come from.

Anything in the realm of free market economics will be attractive to people who believe they'll have inherent advantages over others (natural or inherited). Men are in general more confident in their abilities. That's why we tend to be slightly shittier investors. 

&gt; The model of economics espoused by the school believes that money should be tied to something tangible, like gold. 

Gold itself is unfeasible as currency. Paying for dollar's worth of cough drops with less than a thousandth of an ounce of gold is stupid. (This is a problem skirted by the bitcoin, which is why it's so popular in the manosphere.)

A gold standard in general is also problematic as you mentioned. 

There's something else you haven't mentioned yet though. Gold backed IOUs still rely on the credibility and authority of the gold owner. This goes beyond the his mere personal integrity, but his ability to protect himself (e.g. from robbers) and the integrity of his IOUs from others (e.g. counterfeiters). It's no better than fiat money in that regard.

For a country as large as the USA, for a state as powerful and durable, there's no way they wouldn't take advantage of our latent value via fiat money. To buy our products, to live here, to get our education, you have to have currency accepted by us. All that faith in the US has value that *someone* has to take advantage of.

Inflation/Devaluation of the dollar is the primary stated concern, but it's also a tool for the gov't to control the debt level and even a point of leverage in foreign policy.

EDIT: At a second glance, I don't agree with some of it.

&gt; What makes this system unpopular with American right-wingers is that they perceive the Fed as having a LOT of unchecked power, because they can pretty much add money to the money supply whenever they want (they can't, doing this without US Treasury permission is illegal), causing a major inflation spike, and rendering wealthy people's wealth worthless. They would like a gold standard because inflation has happened every year except 2009 since coming off the gold standard. This inflation saps people of their wealth.

This is an incomplete picture, and gives a slightly biased view against right-wingers. Inflation can hurt lower classes as well. 

Wealthy people tend to be educated about their money and have the financial tools to react and adjust quickly. Besides, it's not like they store their wealth as dollar bills under a mattress. It's much harder to adjust when you're lower class, living paycheck to paycheck and don't have the notice or time to react to rising prices.

I'm a mother, but it's still weird to me to say that, as if such an identity doesn't really describe me. It's not even like saying I'm a knitter. I chose to become A Knitter, as opposed to just picking up knitting as a hobby -- I chose to make knitting part of my identity -- but I guess maybe I never chose to become A Mother.

And have you ever tried it? having a vinyl mix done, then vinyl master (that hopefully comes out good on the first try or else you have to pay for another lacquer) then the actual pressing with labels, then have to get covers and the fancier (inserts. gatefold, download card) it is the more it costs. we all want all the records in our fantasy wish list but unless you have a dumb amount of money you'll never get em all.

I don't like this article because it implies that poor people who vote republican are too stupid to vote in their own interest.

MotivationToControl,changemyview,1389337714.0,"This is certainly the fashionable response. But, it really only counts as a criticism of certain forms of socialism, specifically Marxist-Leninism. Other forms take into account human psychology, theoretically without creating the injustice, inequality, instability, and unsustainabiity we see in capitalist societies. 

The sole defining principle of socialism is workplace democracy, i.e. worker control of the means of production. Worker cooperatives, which have been functioning within the capitalist system for generations, are an example of a socialist economic plan on a smaller scale. They are be able to grow as big as major corporations and compete with them, and they naturally form conglomerates. The Spanish conglomerate Mondragon, for instance, controls almost the entire economy of the entire Basque region of Spain. Despite Spain going through a great depression, most of the cooperatives have remained productive and profitable, with the sole exception of Fagor, which recently filed for bankruptcy. 

So, I believe you are uninformed. Socialism is quite possible, can be compatible with human nature, and does not need to have utopian aims. We could have a fairer and more productive economic system than capitalism, under socialism."

Cap_Had,magicTCG,1389337918.0,"Here are my comments on the deck.

Lifegain is fun, but it has a few problems as a strategy to build a deck around. The main issue is that it's not a win condition. You can gain all the life you want, but it's mostly just stalling. Aggressive decks can burn through your life much more quickly than you might expect. Lifegain is mostly useful in either control or combo decks. Control decks like incidental lifegain like in Sphinx's Revelation because it helps them survive to late in the game when they can actually win. Your deck looks like you're going to want to use it in more of a combo-y way.

I think the best ways you have of winning games in the deck are Angelic Accord and Voracious Wurm. If you could go up to 3-4 of each of those in the deck, it should help. Unflinching Courage is another strong card which helps you get the most out of those two cards (from the lifelink) while also buffing one of your creatures nicely, so more of those are worth putting in.

You also probably want more ways of dealing with your opponent's threats. Adding more copies of Pacifism or Arrest would be a good start there.

I'd also try to replace the Transguild Promenades with more Selesnya Guildgates. Without more than two colors, the Promenades are strictly worse."

Omega037,changemyview,1389338166.0,"&gt; Those are not physical reactions. The plant's body is sensing its surroundings and changing the way it grows as a result of it. It does not mean the plant is feeling any pain.

Of course they are physical reactions.  The point I was making is that pain itself is really just an interaction of chemicals to help use respond to negative stimuli.  Plants also use chemicals to respond to negative stimuli, and thus experience a form of pain.

I would agree that the nature of this mechanism is more similar in animals, but not that it doesn't exist in plants.  Even in animals, it differs wildly between worms, insects, fish, birds, dogs, and humans.  

My point is that plants and animals don't either have our pain or not, but lie along a spectrum of similarity.  Other primates would be the closest on the spectrum to us, plants would be further, and microorganisms would be even further than that.  

After all, wouldn't you rather kill a single bacteria than kill a 300 year old tree?

&gt; This does not mean I would not feel any guilt or compunction about the death of the rats. This does not mean that the death of the rats were morally justified. This does not mean it was right that the rats died. I would definitely still feel empathy for the rats. The death of any animal/human is a very sad thing no matter who it saves.

Would you still feel the same if you were killing earthworms instead?  What about ants or mosquitoes?  The very fact that you recognize that people (including yourself) can value the life of different animals at different levels means that it isn't necessarily ""hypocritical to be morally against abortion, but still eat meat"" as the OP originally stated.

&gt;  I mentioned pain of the central nervous system because it is something all animals have

First, let me correct you.  There are some animals, like sponges or mesozoa, that do not have a CNS.  Furthermore, the CNS in jellyfish and some worms do not really resemble a CNS as we think of it.

&gt; Many animals, especially mammals, have been shown to feel emotional pain. I personally believe almost all animals can feel emotional pain even though some have not been proven.

Outside of animals that are self aware (which none of the animals we eat are, besides those who eat dolphin), emotional pain is simply another biochemical mechanism.  A dog associates the release of an enzyme with a particular sound, smell, or other stimuli.  The fact that the symptoms of this enzyme release is something we decide to call ""happy"" doesn't change the fact that it is biologically indistinguishable from pain.

Similarly, plants release enzymes in response to good or bad stimuli.  One could argue that the biochemical reaction to sunlight makes a plant ""happy"", since it too gives off symptoms that could be qualified as such.

&gt; As I just mentioned in my last paragraph, I do not care if the pain is similar to ours or not, animals can feel pain and plants cannot.

But like I said, that just isn't true.  You make a completely arbitrary distinction of what ""pain"" is, then do a binary classification into things that either are completely equal to our pain or completely removed.  

Since it is an subjective definition, distinction, and categorization, people will naturally have different opinions as to where things lie.  Unless you tell me right now you have felt bad every single time a mosquito has died?

Regardless, as I have said before, I don't choose to use pain (or what you call pain) as a determination of value, simply the similarity and closeness to myself (which might include pain as a variable, or it might not).  

&gt; You should feel bad about killing an animal to save a human or higher order animal. Whether you did it to save someone you love or not, it is still an absolutely disgusting act to commit.

I don't generally feel the slightest bit bad about killing most animals, and for some (mosquitoes, bees, gnats) I would actually feel good about it.  I would probably feel somewhat bad about killing a primate or dolphin, and I would certainly feel bad about killing one of my own pets (unless it was sick or otherwise necessary).

The fact is that we just have different value structures.  We agree on some valuations (that humans and primates are high value and plants are low value), but disagree on others.  That said, there are some people who would probably agree that even your valuation doesn't go far enough, and that even killing a rat to save a human would be wrong.

However, my goal here is not to convince you to agree with my value structure.  The CMV doesn't actually address the issue of whether abortion or eating meat is immoral, but whether a person can be morally consistent about the issues.

In other words, so long as you recognize that a person can have a value system that elevates human life greatly above animal life, then regardless of whether you agree with that system, one can oppose abortion and eat meat without being hypocritical.

blahtender,buildapc,1389338218.0,"Another note: the whole PCMasterRace subreddit thing is way overblown right now. Yes, a PC will yield higher graphics than a console, but a PC that yields the same results as a PS4 or XB1 will usually be more expensive than the console. A few things to keep in mind:

-The PS4 uses GDDR5 RAM only. 

-The XB1 uses DDR3 and ESRAM.

-A gaming PC (generally) will use both DDR3 (for computing and caching) and GDDR5 RAM (for rendering and game physics).

-Both new-gen consoles use an AMD ~1.7ghz 8-core Jaguar processor with integrated graphics.

-PCs can use more efficient FX-series and Intel processors with a dedicated GPU for gaming purposes (consoles: 1 processor does everything, PC: processors dedicated to different jobs), whereas the new consoles use one processor for both (they are essentially prebuilt PCs at this point).

There is nothing wrong with console gaming. It's fun. It's less expensive in the long run. PCMasterRace likes to smear their image because the PCs CAN yield better graphics, but a $500 build may or may not be up to snuff with the consoles at the current time, since you're looking at about $370 worth of hardware, and $130 worth of peripherals, OS, and security (and that's on the low-end).

Im going to go ahead and basically undermine the underling premise of OP's Post. Yes, being beefier will help you attract women. But you will never be able to get a truly impressive physique if all you want it for is to attract women.
            
**My Motivation:**      
My biggest fear is being average. There is no worse feeling for me than being an indistinguishable part of the herd, that is being corralled for someone else's benefit. I get this feeling a lot in bars and clubs were sexual competition is monetized and  males compete by outspending each other via drinks tables and fancy clothes. No, I don't want to watch the Superbowl and root for a team like a plebeian. No I don't want to go to a concert and hoot at a celebrity. I don't want to be part of the crowd, I want to be in a class of my own.

Bodybuilding allows me to separate myself from the crowd. I have an impressive physique because I do things that other people are mentally too weak to do. Do you think the average 20 something year old male can get through 12 weeks of [Smolov](http://stronglifts.com/how-to-add-100-pounds-to-your-squat-smolov/), squatting 300+ pounds for two hours a day three times a week? No, because he doesn't have the will. Because he is a consumer bitch that only knows instant gratification. He can P90X all day, because its a cool fashionable workout he saw on TV, that will help him get Abz and Girlz. But in the corner there is a large man in the squat rack with 500 pounds on a barbell. P90 Pussy will never look like me because he will never push himself to the same extreme.

**Yea whatever but do the girls like big muscles?**       
Being a beefcake attracts alot of attention. In my graduate school section im usually wearing a large loose shirt that fits my lats and im constantly eating and drinking water. I frequently catch girls staring at me out of curiosity. If a girl is eye-fucking you its pretty easy to walk up and talk to her and say something. Hey, you wanna get lunch with me? What, have we met? No, but I saw you staring with this hungry look in your eyes, I figured you could use some food.        
Proving value is realy easy for me, I take girls to the gym and teach them barbell squats and lunges also [this smith machine move.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u00DOXwyOTk). Biffault's law states that women only associate when they receive a benefit. Well there is a huge benefit from associating with a personal trainer, so getting sex isn't that hard. Plus when you are training a girl at the gym you are asserting dominance over her in a positive way. Girls like to be bossed around.

I hope that helps."

But there aren't really any other purely symbolic moments in the movie: most of the characters' actions have a realistic, rational basis with symbolic subtext. But that's why Justine lying naked under Melancholia stands out: I'm only seeing the symbolism and not the literal level. Am I missing something?"

Nausved,relationship_advice,1389338406.0,"Just for the record, a restraining order isn't necessarily the best response to a threat, depending on the situation. I went through a somewhat similar situation several years ago, and I sought the advice of a lawyer. He advised *against* a restraining order; he said it was too risky. If a person is crazy/angry enough, getting notice of a restraining order can actually infuriate them further and incite violence. Instead, he had me keep records of *everything* and be ready to flee the state (e.g., suitcase already packed and in the car, ready to go) at the drop of a hat.

Restraining orders are very useful against people who are harassing or bullying you, but they can be counterproductive against someone who is sufficiently angry that they don't care about getting arrested. If they are suicidal, this can be especially risky, since they may decide to simply take you out with them."

MikeyDeez,IAmA,1389338458.0,"No problem. 

If you're interested in that sort of thing, here are some of the unique legal situations we get into:

- APSCW's in my state have complete civil and criminal immunity while conducting a case as long as we are acting in good faith and adhering to standards &amp; procedures. 


- APSCW'sa are HIPAA exempt. A healthcare professional does not have to worry about violating HIPAA when giving us information. *(This one is really difficult for doctors/nurses to wrap their heads around, and they're right to be cautious of it)*

- If, in the course of my investigation, an APSCW determines that my client is ""incompetent"" (I don't like that term), we can work ""CBI"", which (in the context of an investigation) grants us what amount to privileges usually reserved for court-appointed guardians. Banking records, medical histories/doctors charts, etc... This is especially useful in situations where an elder has been neglected and/or abandoned and there are nor powers of attorney or guardianship papers. Its common that an alleged abuser is the alleged victim's guardian/POA. In these cases, I can work around that if I suspect the AV is in danger and the AA is interfering with the investigation.

- Getting sued for trespassing (usually when the AV lets us into the AA's house while the AA is at work or something), stalking, privacy violation type things, etc... is the majority of what we ""get in trouble"" for.  Its not unheard of for more frustrating things like someone totally fabricating stories of APSCW's breaking something, running over a mailbox, breaking a lock/doorknob.

- Having litigation brought against you for allegedly ""violating"" HIPAA, POA's, and guardianship orders in the course of our investigation. Basically, I don't usually totally defer to someone just telling me they're guardian or POA when it interferes with my investigation.  A classic example is an AA (usually family member) who tries to claim I can't speak with my client because they're a guardian and decline services on the AV's behalf. *(90% of the time calling their bluff a la ""Okay, well while you go retrieve that documentation, I'm going to speak with my client"" handles it.* 

A really nice recent bit of legislation passed that made the State's Attorney our legal representation if they determine we were adhering to S&amp;P.

On a related note, I have the phrase **""Always keep your words soft and sweet, just in case you have to eat them.""** taped over my phone. Wise words."

MotivationToControl,changemyview,1389338483.0,"&gt; This is just one of MANY problems with socialism. I suggest you read ""1984"" or ""Animal Farm"" or one of the MANY book written by people under communist/socialist regime the depict how terrible life is in a society with no freedom. Or honestly just open a history book and you will see the success of people that believed in simlar ideas as you. There is a reason why every modern state has capitalism.

Orwell was a democratic socialist... Animal Farm is a criticism of Marxist-Leninism, not of socialism in general. Nineteen Eighty-Four is about authoritarianism in general, not about socialism, though Oceana was a socialist country in name (but, like all the political language in the book, it was doublespeak). 

Read Animal Farm again. It's really a scathing criticism of both capitalism and Marxist-Leninism. At the end, the pigs become indistinguishable from the farmers. The farmers are the capitalists. Duh..."

Photosynthese,Guitar,1389338495.0,"I have been writing music ever since I knew Am, G and D (well, and Powerchords of course), to me there was never sense in music if I couldn't express myself.

That being said, I have different processes: sometimes I will just noodle around and find a riff I like, and then try to make it into a song by expanding the riff in its key, Other times I learned a new chord or technique and am determined to incorporate it into a song so I use it in one of my many scrap ideas to makeit interesting enough to pursue. Sometimes I just go, ""I'll write a Tool song"" and do this half assed attempt at what I imagine a TOOL song would sound like with my shitty skills and gear ;)

Most of the time though, I have half a melody, two or more lines of lyrics and play those over and over again until eventually something natural comes out of me that feels right. From there on out, I have a song skeleton that I work with (substitute certain chords to accentuate certain passages, change the timing, fiddle with effects...). After that, I take it to the band rehearsal space and we tweak it for a couple of days until we're all satisfied or I decide I hate it and never want anyone to hear it ever again ;)

I hope this helps, since I don't really play progressive metal, which I consider more of composing, but I guess the basic songwriting process remains.

If you want to contribute to a song, think about interesting arpeggios and ways to influence the mood and atmosphere of the song; never be afraid to try things out, even if they suck and sound terrible - now you know that they do."

After saving the life of the President, two Secret Service agents find themselves abruptly transferred to Warehouse 13 -- a massive, top-secret storage facility in windswept South Dakota that houses every strange artifact, mysterious relic, fantastical object and supernatural souvenir ever collected by the U.S. government. The Warehouse's caretaker Artie (Saul Rubinek) charges Pete (Eddie McClintock) and Myka (Joanne Kelly) with chasing down reports of supernatural and paranormal activity in search of new objects to cache at the Warehouse, as well as helping him to control the warehouse, itself.

If you actually look at the Constitution, you will notice that a large amount of the Bill of Rights is devoted to giving people the chance to defend themselves in court before their rights are taken. The right to an attorney, a speedy trial with an impartial jury, confront your accuser, to be informed of the charges, and to compel witnesses to testify.

These rights do not exist to protect the guilty, they exist to protect the innocent.  The reason to give them to suspected terrorists is not so that they can avoid punishment, but so that those who are innocent (incorrectly suspected of terrorism) won't be punished.

Syncs,Metroid,1389338654.0,"Power bean and annihilator beam take out the first form's tentacles pretty well, and the core gets flattened by about 4 well timed super missiles. Missiles do not work very well against the tentacles all the time, because they move faster than they can track and tend to explode against the ceiling (though they can hit multiple at once with the explosion radius). I personally like to save my ammo to unload fully charged light beam blasts on the third form. 
Second form is actually pretty easy, just blow things up one at a time and never charge your boost ball and you are good. You can even destroy a few extra of the dark blobs it deploys to get a bit more health and/or missiles, but it might be better to continue to the third phase as soon as possible. 
Third phase is a doozy, that is for sure. Possibly one of the hardest bosses in the entire Prime series, definitely not playing around. Super missiles and charge shots are your friend here, but the timing is tricky and only gets faster as the battle progresses. I usually just eat the multiple beam attack, it really is nearly impossible to dodge, but I think you can roll/boost under the Emperor's body when it is charging to get away mostly unharmed...if you want to risk it. As far as getting shots in, I have noticed a couple of weird things about the wee beastie. First, if you screw attack off of its main body at juuuuust the right angle, you can knock yourself onto a lip at the edge of the cavern (this is more fun than anything, I think you stay in range of some attacks regardless of what you do). Second, the Emperor has...well, a hole in its head. It has a circular hole, like a massive alien donut, taken right out of the back of its ""heart."" Perhaps it was just a glitch in my game or something, I will have to replay it (or feel free to say yea or nay, I cannot seem to find a screen shot anywhere). In any case, this is a minor target, as it is very rarely presented and is only about one morph ball in diameter (you can't seem to get into it, sadly, but you can still do damage if you shoot it). As far as any more battle strategy, my main problem with the darn thing is getting it to keep its front ""knee"" out of the way - it always tries to face you with it, and it becomes a giant impenetrable shield. Super Missiles work best against its red heart, charged light beam works best against dark, and as mentioned elsewhere, the dark beam is a bit too slow against the light heart (though it does fantastic damage if you manage to hit it, so no point in not shooting). Just keep at it for a bit and you should get the timing, or go back and get more powerups from earlier stages. 

TL;DR: First comes power beam and super missiles, second comes bombs and recovery, third comes a couple of weird glitches and observations. "

CaptainBlicero,TrueFilm,1389338955.0,"To me it sounds like you're letting your expectations of what you would have liked to see prevent you from appreciating what Spike Jonze only wanted to show. 

Personally I love that there is this massive futuristic world that begs so many questions to be answered and things to be explored but consciously chooses not let the viewers in on it all. The fact that the film provoked the issues you have with it in the first place is testament enough of Jonze's ability to world build. 

Sometimes less is more. What if Jonze explored the things you consider were problems in his film? What if the way he went about them were disappointing or not as exciting as you thought they should be? The film has focus and does not allow itself to get distracted by all the possibilities its own world has opened for itself. Instead you're given a love story that allows the viewer to feel like he or she is involved in something bigger than him or herself. 

Is it an issue that Jonze decided not to focus on the lower class? I think it is not. Surely it would be an interesting aspect to explore in any sci-fi film, but not Jonze's film. He had one goal and it was to tell his story about Theodore and Samantha. One valuable thing I have learned in all the years I've spent watching movies is to try to view them with a fresh and open mind. You'll frustrate yourself if you watch movies as if they were made to  cater to your standards. "

kempff,cheatatmathhomework,1389339417.0,"Here's another way.

If you're taking the somethingeth root of something, touch up the thing in a preliminary way to expose the perfect squares or cubes or whatever that are factors.

√(28x^(5)):

* 28x^5 = 2^2 7 x^2 x^2 x
* rearrange thus 2^2 x^2 x^2 7 x
* square root then is (2 x x) √(7 x), that is, 2x^(2)√(7x)

cubed root of -54x^(6)y^(4):

* first of all, a cube root of a negative is going to be negative

* -54x^(6)y^(4) = (-1) 2 3^3 x^3 x^3 y^3 y
* rearrange (-1) 3^3 x^3 x^3 y^3 2 y
* cube root is then (-1) (3 x x y) cuberoot(2y), that is, -3x^(2)y times cuberoot(2y)

square root of 5x^(6) over square root of 3x^(4)y^(5):

* 5x^(6) = 5 x^2 x^2 x^(2), square root is x^(3)√5
* 3x^(4)y^(5) = 3 x^2 x^2 y^2 y^2 y, square root is x^(2)y^(2)√(3y)

The one over the other cancels down to x√5 over y^(2)√(3y), and depending on your teacher the answer could also be (x over y^(2)) times the square root of (5/(3y)).

Done! :-)"

MotivationToControl,changemyview,1389339544.0,"&gt;Mondragon? It's an umbrella corporation of 100+ little co-op businesses. Yes, socialism can work on the small scale, though in my opinion some of those businesses are way over the optimum size limit with a few hundred workers or more. Even your example corporation is known to exploit South American workers for profit, according to critics.

They seem to be doing fine, though a capitalist system is not even an ideal setting for cooperatives to work in. As for the exploitation of other workers, I haven't heard anything but it's possible. That's most likely a result of having to compete with companies that do the same thing. 

I actually prefer an economy founded on small little coops, formed into syndicates, instead of depending upon large corporations to run the economy. Big, monopolistic corporations don't make for a stable economy. Having lots of diversity, and distributing economic control and power into as many hands as possible is a good thing. It's not good to put your eggs all in one basket.

&gt;Considering that, I don't see anything in your comment to disagree with what I said. Socialism can work on the small scale, and it's never been shown to work on the large scale.
Has it honestly ever had the chance to work on the large scale? The major ""socialist"" movements were Stalinism, Maoism, and other Marxist-Leninist outfits, which have been criticized by socialists due to the fact that democracy is an essential component of socialism. 

Saying that it has never been shown to work on a large scale is not really an argument, as you're dealing with a sample size of zero. I admit, it's not been tested on a large scale. But, it needs to be, because capitalism is unsustainable. 

You don't make progress without taking risks. There was no promise that liberal democracy would work, either. People thought it was impossible for a society to function without a monarchy. "

But when you're a shit team for reasons far beyond ""your defensive system gives up shots"" you're going to end up with shitty Corsi. 

The numbers are subject to interpretation. Fundamentally, counting shots is a bad way to measure performance.

We still don't know if a team can be successful and still be shit on Corsi. 

Well, actually, we do know a team can win the cup with a sub 500 Corsi. The Pens did it. But hey, we just ignore that because the Wild or something.

I mean, don't go into it expecting super philosophical stuff (it's still shounen, after all), but characters are well fleshed out (even the villains) and each plot arc always offers something new.

Yet when you suggest this to most capitalists they go completely on the back foot because government and law give them an advantage, proving they aren't really in favour of a free market, just one which means they need to do less to make more.

Anything in between complete communism and anarchy doesn't work. And we have never witnessed either system, all communist systems have been broken mongrel children of communism, and anarchism, well, we haven't seen that since man discovered the power of fear in ruling. The key thing is that less government power now would only favour big business (in real terms, our current overlords), none would free up markets and stop monopolization and funneling of wealth to the current mercantilist centers of capital, but we're never going to get none.

thegeekist,polyamory,1389340040.0,"Here are some things about handfasting that you really need to know especially if you are dating a pagan, which is sounds like you are.

1) Handfastings are temporary for a reason. So people can figure out if they want to be together for longer. One common form of handfasting is to treat the 1 year and a day as a trail period for a deeper commitment. 

2) Some people use it in a marriage ceremony in place of other rituals and still get the marriage licence.

3) Some people get handfasted without a marriage licence and treat it like a ""typical"" marriage. 

4) Some people believe that handfasting is similar to marriage, but multiple people can get handfasted to others at the same time they are handfasted to someone else. Meaning you wouldn't necessarily be second to anyone.

So while there is nothing wrong with having your standards you acted rashly without finding out all the details you need to make an informed decision. You freaked out and instead of waiting to get hurt you ran.

Since you still love him apologize for freaking out and ask to have a conversation with the two people getting handfasted to see what it means for them. Tell them your decision might not change, but you need to know more."

Unless I misunderstand, you're saying that people are being motivated by their sexual attraction to young white blonde girls. But your evidence doesn't really support that. You'd have to show that missing non-white children aren't given as much attention, and more improbably, that missing non-blonde white females and that missing white male children are not given as much attention.

Supply/demand equilibrium is a valid model also for money, not only produce, when there is an excess in supply, the potential barrier of lower sales is reduced, so companies won't hesitate to raise prices.

&gt; If McDonalds were to increase its prices, people would go to those restaurants instead.

Yes, if we are talking about a highly competitive marketplace where the cost of changing sellers is non-existent. But in reality people don't react until the change in cost is something tangible, they buy 4 nuggets at what 5 nuggets cost up until recently. Also higly competitive enviroments are not sustainable when dealing with low demand markets, that is why the poor have less options than the middle class. In this real life context, Mcdonalds raise in prices, would be observed faster by people working in that sector than the consumers.

 The next step will be suppliers raising prices making competitors raise prices, because the money supply can obviously tolerate that change, as proven by the Mcdonald consumer that might just notice that that .85 just became a .98. After a financial quarter, or a year you compare the prices and figure out what your inflation is. And this is without considering the macroeconomic effect of a higher monetary volume.

When it comes down to it, the economy is made out of human relations, humans don't always respect the statistical model especially when faced with new situations. Neglecting the behavioral aspect and not considering the worst ramifications of a measure could cause disastrous effects, despite starting out with the greatest of intentions.

I am all for the social issue of living in a society that guarantees basic human decency to it's less fortunate, but the universal income is just another Keynesian crutch for business that serve low income people, with the added benefit of giving an excuse to the state to get rid of current social programs."

meatwagon20,dogs,1389340119.0,"Thank you for the response and information. 

I was interested in the Siberian Husky when one of my neighbors dog-sat one with blue and green eyes and I fell in love with it. 

I love Golden Retrievers just because of the type of animal they are and their loyalty. My dad used to rent out the 1st floor of our house and they had 2 dogs one of them was a golden retriever and was basically my best friend when I was a kid. Although I'm sure my parents would not be fond of the shedding issue. 

I really like loyalty in a dog and one that loves the family and will protect it. I'm not interested in those that are taught meaningless commands that serve no purpose it doesn't appeal for me. Also and easy to train dog such as a Golden Retriever would be ideal. The reason why I like the German Shepherd is because of their loyalty and playfulness.

Another key point is having a dog that's social with others as I mentioned earlier. 

Social
Easy to train (As it's my first puppy but I have experience with dogs)
Loyal
Moderate-low shedding (I think we'll be able to overlook this and opt for the Golden Retriever if we comb it and give baths to it often)

The exercise portion will be no problem as I go on daily runs for fitness.  Thanks to your information I crossed out Husky's as they seem to be not the type for me.

I know I mentioned that price would not be an issue but I checked online, not craigslist, and some puppies go as high as 2 grand, which I think for anyone regardless is steep. If you do not recommend Craigslist for choosing dogs what do you recommend? Every pet store I've visited have no dogs on display."

Nausved,relationship_advice,1389340172.0,"Honestly, this makes me a tad suspicious of your roommate.

If she's going to pay rent, keep in mind that this means she needs to sign a contract with the landlord, and she needs to get her fair share out of it. She needs to be able to *properly* move in, with all her stuff, *and* she should get what she's paying for. For example, if she pays 1/3 of the rent ($1000), then she should get 1/3 of the apartment bedroom space to herself. If she's sharing a room with you, and your room is worth 1/2 the rent ($1500), then each of you should only be paying half of that ($750 each). 

Make sure your roommate isn't try to screw you over by getting you and your girlfriend to pay for more than your fair share of the apartment. If he gets half the bedroom space, for example, he pays half the rent; don't let him weasel out of paying for what he's renting."

GaProgMan,GamePhysics,1389340278.0,"Problem with this is that it's less a physics thing, more 3D modelling issue. 3D models in games are made up of a series of vertices (straight lines that intersect where they meet), some 3D modelling programs can produce models that cause graphics engines to get confused when animating them.

What's happened here is that the graphics engine draws the head, begins rotating it slightly (as per the scripted animation for the play).

What happens next is that it decides that the head is pointing the wrong way, instead of snapping the head to point in the direction that it thinks it should point, the graphics engine slowly rotates the head (as this would be less immediately jarring than snapping) into place.

Problem is, that when it gets there, it had to complete the scripted animation (which will say something like: rotate to face x degrees from the starting position over a number of seconds in). So, the engine dutifully does what it's told. It rotates the head from its current position (facing behind the character) to the final position. Thus Touchdown Tom is born.

It's the second thing that plagued Fallout (I forget whether it was the 3rd one or the one after it).

The main article for Chykka also claims that it was possessed by the Ing in [This](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/File:Dark_Torvus_Temple_Chykka_posession_Dolphin_HD.jpg) photo. Also, the scan data in-game for [Dark War Wasps](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_War_Wasp) note that Ing can detach from their hosts, though perhaps not without killing it. Partial Ing possession is also not fatal, as shown through the scan data of [A-Voq's](http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/A-Voq) corpse. But it is hard to say about the Chykka, as 1) we never see any free Ing actually appear in the battle, unlike some other scenes where the Ing come in through [portals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fah7yvq9QSI)  2) it is impossible to know if the Chykka was fully possessed if it WAS possessed at all and 3) if the Chykka had enough or any will to foil the possession if it started.

Consider the (compact) disk of radius R also centered at 0: compactness tells us that the continuous function |p(z)| attains a minimum within this disk; but since |p(0)| is already smaller than the |p(z)| on the boundary, this minimum must be in the interior. Then using sequential induction on d'Alembert's theorem that if p(z) \ne 0, then every disk around z contains some point z' such that |p(z')| &lt; |p(z)|, we can find a strictly decreasing sequence of points on the interior of the disk so that the minimum z^* must be zero."

pizzaandburritos,dating,1389340950.0,"I agree with you. I think you raise some excellent points. 

On the other hand, I think there is some amount of change that is part of the trajectory of time. Regarding your comment about how we size guys up by their height and penis size prematurely, my grandparents would probably say we do that even without these new trends. Even with normal dating, we make judgments on appearance and sex much earlier than would have happened in more conservative times and cultures when people kept their clothes on longer. Now, I realize Tinder takes it to an extreme, so your point still stands, but I just wanted to point that out.  I think the critical point you are making is that it doesn't just make us quick to judge; we're also becoming quick to expect a certain level of 'perfection' on qualities that are easy to judge but not necessarily that important to us in reality. 

Facebook started for similar purposes of shallowly checking people out. Even today, people use it as a hooking up tool. It encourages passing judgment on people based on really superficial things. Then again, there is a lot of good that can come out of facebook as well. I don't see that kind of potential for Tinder but my point is just that it's certainly not exceptional in the way it has managed to make us more shallow. "

She makes interesting and bold claims backed by very good evidence:

1. She argues that the genetic contribution of Neolithic farmers in Europe has been greatly underestimated because mtDNA Haplogroup H was long been wrongly thought to originate in SW Europe during the LGM, new data shows that the highest diversity of hg-H as well as it's deepest branches occurs in the Middle East, indicating that it originated there.

2. There were not 1 but 2 bursts of migration from the Near East into Europe. The first brought farming, the second brought dairy cows, ox-driven plows, and copper working. She also argues that the Basques come from this second burst of migration.

3. Indo-European speakers spread west from the Pontic steppes very quickly and she argues that the Bell Beaker culture was Indo-European and spoke Proto-Italo-Celtic."

Basically what the other poster was getting at: not claiming earnings from others' work.

&gt; What about someone who invented a product or process, and monetized it?

We'd have to account for (take off) all the work done by other people in the process of ""monetize it"" and then see how much value the invent brought. That's impossible to do, of course; just a mental exercise.

&gt;Someone who built a business from the ground up?

You know, I think we need to delve deeper into *value theories* to discuss this. Some academics will tell you stuff like ""hey, you just started the business and then leeched from your employees, therefore the only value you actually created by your own hands is small"" and others will say ""hey, the value people are creating because of the baseline value he created wouldn't have ever existed if not for his work, therefore it (or a % of it) should be considered as his own value created"".

Anyway, I'm rambling. I was talking about the first quote there. I'm talking about value as in ""the value you've given to something* through your exclusively own work"".

Yes, it's presumptuous, but if I'm interested and haven't made a move, I can always play it off, like ""what?, no... yeah.. I knew that.  I mean, you're totally not my type"" and then you can apologize for ""misreading the situation"". 

You've just saved me a bunch of time, and now I can move on. That would be my preference."
CalvinDehaze,AskMen,1389341464.0,"Back when I was more insecure, I would look, then look away if the girl saw me. Now, I look just enough to take her in, and if she sees me, I smile. I don't stare, or lick my lips or anything, but I look long enough to say ""yeah, I'm looking at you, and I think you're hot"". "

no, we won't add this because it's disrespectful to image hosts. RES has over 2 million users. Automating that function would waste tons of bandwidth that has to be paid for by someone, and that's not cool."

A 16 year old is a world away from being a mature adult capable of mature adult decisions, and in this instance was clearly predated upon by an significantly older, more mature, controller. While you met your husband at 18 and are still happy, OP is very obviously not. Hence her coming here asking for help with being controlled and treated like a maid.
