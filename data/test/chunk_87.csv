gobberpooper,videos,1390816661.0,"Instead of downvoting you, I'm going to explain this foreign experience to you. I'm sure you're familiar with street performances of someone playing a song on their guitar and singing and people are gathered around and it sounds pretty good and its entertaining right? I remember being in Italy and a guy in Naples was shredding the guitar and doing his own solo for Stairway to Heaven, it was great.

Here's the hip-hop parallel. A couple dudes are just talking and one of them says they've been listening to a few new rappers, and they get into talking about whatever. A couple other friends tell them they should rap battle. One guy beatboxes a nice, steady beat (sometimes). One of the guys starts rapping, and he's alright. The next guy follows up and tries to one-up him. You notice a crowd gathering around the two. Every time one of them has a really good line everyone yells ""Oooohhhhhhh!!!"" The rappers go back and forth, back and forth. An even bigger crowd has gathered and everyone has their heads bobbing to a beat. It's pretty much over when one person chokes because they have no come back, or when the crowd yells so much that they get drowned out. Everyone's going ape shit, and then it's over. That's a live hip hop experience."

You are the source of Peace, but you are also the source of Healing and Life. Let her doctors fall silent and be humbled before Your mighty hand. Show us that You think death is unacceptable, and that only You have the power to say ""not today"". May your Name be ever glorified and hear our prayers, though utterly unworthy, but a request made boldly before your throne in Jesus' Name. Amen. 


*hug~~~~* ='( I .....usually do not make healing petitionary prayers. I believe in the Soverignty of God, that He gives illnesses and He cures them, at His discretion, and that it is better always to pray for wisdom of doctors, of good results from medical science treatments, of peace and acceptance and less suffering. I have never prayed for miraculous cures. My mothers has had a brain tumor for 10 years and my father has cancer as well. I have never prayed for their miraculous cures, either. It is probably a failure of faith in my part that I never felt 'comfortable' praying for miracles. 

But I felt moved to do so for you tonight. God be with you, sister. And your family and beloved.

abcd_z,TheRedPill,1390816980.0,"Marriage means you're unlikely to end the relationship unless it's something major, *and she knows it*, which means:  
She's more likely to cause drama

Noumenology,self,1390816981.0,"Money and material things are attachments that ultimately cause suffering. 

Nothing is permanent, but we all desire a sort of permanence in our lives - we don't want to die, we want someone to love us forever, we want our happy moments to lat and the bad ones to stay away. That's impossible - there will always be good times and bad times. If we can release our grasp on those wishes, our intense desire for them, it will make us happier. I'm not saying we shouldn't wish for good things, but we shouldn't have an anxiety or attachment to the idea, and that *I can't be happy unless...*

Likewise, material things are attachments with the guise of permanence but they will not satisfy us either. Wealth is usually a responsibility and a source of tension - it changes how you see yourself and other people, the way you live your life, and how you feel about money. As one wise man said, ""mo money mo problems."" Another caveat - poverty sucks. So I'm not saying being poor is desirable. I'm saying that wealth is not a source of happiness and is also easily lost, so it has a sense of attachment *equal or greater to* your current desire for being wealthy. Consider this. 

Also it sounds like you're experiencing the pangs of class consciousness. And that your friends are gaudy assholes. You're a sophomore in college and you have the chance to attain more than they have in the exchange of ideas. Use this time to accumulate knowledge and be open to ideas instead of their materialistic transitory superficial bullshit. "

Not selfish reasons, like EACCES said. 

Try to find the Christian fellowship at your college and reach out to them. Attend their prayer and meet ups during the week. You should be able to 'fill up"" a bit more that way. Maybe if someone there is going to another church you can explain to your family that you are attending that one with a friend. I love you how explained that you find your current church lacking. Be respectful, and just reiterate the minimal. ""I want to hear more about Jesus' love and His calling for me."" You don't have to criticize, you just have to keep saying you'd like more.

I'm glad you're reaching out for more of Him! Hang in there, and let your behaviour to a testimony for those in your family stuck in one of ""those"" churches. It may eventually grow to be the rope that pulls them out of the fire.

They ate more frequently than the poor but sober Italians. **Jews are rich and help each other through a secret web of mutual assistance. However, the followers of Ur-Fascism must also be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.** Fascist governments are condemned to lose wars because they are constitutionally incapable of objectively evaluating the force of the enemy.

Followed SuSE for several versions up to 9.3, after that, switched to Debian or later some exotic distributions which were offering a guided approach to Debian unstable (you were notified if something broke unstable and also workarounds etc).

On other systems, I started with the first Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty) and switched over completely to Ubuntu around 7.10 (Gutsy) after 

1. I got fed up with Debian's OSS zealotry; the whole childish Firefox / Iceweasel controversy, the refusal to include firmware etc. etc.
2. I grew tired of doing all the setup and config things myself. After all these years, I want a system to work out of the box and do the things I need to do.

I have a Mac again, so I am also using Darwin, Apple's FreeBSD-compatible BSD variant, and also FreeBSD on my servers, together with one Linux server. All of these run  on zfs as their filesystem.

Canonical's shenanigans around Wayland / Mir remind me of Debian's zealotry, so I am inclined to jump ship again. Only thing that keeps me at Ubuntu atm is the fact that zfsonlinux is developed for Ubuntu."

Moggehh,AskReddit,1390818081.0,"Super late to the party, but I was a special kind of child so I have a lot of material for this. 

* When I was 4, at a Father's Day celebration I ripped my clothes off, streaked across a park and jumped into a fountain. My dad had to climb in to go get me. It was raining, so I started to turn blue. He ended up putting me in his shirt and our picture was in the newspaper. 
* I've mentioned this before, but when I was in grade one or two I found one of my dad's skin mags and took it to school to show my friends (well, I told them about it and they told me to bring it). We traced it in the library until a fifth grader caught us and it was an awkward principal's visit. 
* In grade one, I woke up feeling sick. I told my mum, she basically told me that there was no way I was staying home. She took me all the way to school, kicking and screaming. I threw such a temper tantrum in front of the school that the principal had to tell us to take it home. 
* My Dad was judging a competition, and my brother and I were wandering around and ended up watching a live radio broadcast. The DJ was asking kids about their day, who they were with etc. The DJ asked me who I was with, and I said my brother and dad. He asked what I thought of my brother, and I said he was a huge shithead. On live radio. My dad was just... ugh so disappointed. I was 11 or 12 at the time. 
* Another radio story. I was 14 and my dad was dating this lady with a talk show. I was listening to her show and I decided to call in with my opinion (fuck my 14 year old self so hard), identified myself, said my dad's whole name, and got him into shit with his lady as I broke tons of rules of calling in (although in my defence they were looking for kids to call in and didn't explain the whole don't identify yourself). 
* Spent a few months as an emo. Listened to MCR and wore *so much black eyeliner*. I died my hair blue/green, it was horrible. I still have pictures. Ugggh
* Called a 12 year old a hooker and got her to ask her mom what it meant. Her mum spent the next 2 years trying to get me kicked out of my school for anything she could find on me. 
* When I was 13, I could manipulate my voice and do a passable Gollum impression. For some reason my brother and I got our dad to sign us up for a **Lord of the Rings Improv/Acting Class.** Went once and was so terrible that I cried and begged to not be forced to go back.

Jesus asked Peter, “But what about you?” he asked. “Who do **you** say I am?” Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”

When Peter saw [the beloved disciple], he asked, “Lord, what about him?” Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? **You** must follow me.

A_for_Anonymous,AskMen,1390819474.0,"Addressing your questions: I wouldn't mind my girlfriend having sex with a shared friend of us we know well and trust because we aren't fully monogamous. I wouldn't feel jealousy, and if she does something at all it's because she doesn't feel weird about it either. I would love to have a FFM threesome, and I love to play with our female shared friend because of the novelty, variety, etc. — just don't overthink it; with sex, if you have fun, you win. All this takes is to have a good head and realize sex is separate from love: you can have sex without love just like you can play chess without love, just for the fun of it.

candydaze,AskReddit,1390819630.0,"My Ma had the opposite of this. She had a good, steady job she'd been at for 14 years. That's important, because in Australia, you get nice payouts and lots of leave that start accruing when you start with the company, but you can only access if you've been there for 15 years. You leave before that, you get nothing. 

So, she got seriously head hunted by the big rival company. Really lucrative salary, better position, all that. Big decision, especially considering that 14 years thing. In the end she took it. 

She was made redundant in under six weeks. No payout, no nothing. Meaning she'd lost a whole lot of money by hopping to this rival, on the promise of a pay rise. She was going to sue for unfair dismissal, but in the end it was settled out of court, with her getting a payout of most of what she would have got, had she stayed, and she managed to find a new job pretty quickly. 

So last year, I had an interview with that same company that screwed her over. First question: ""what do you know about the company?"". It took all my self control to not say ""that you're all a bunch of crooks"". "

That's just not true.  We saw them, particularly Red Bull, running excessive camber at Spa a year or so ago.  Pirelli was warning them about failures, but what happened was massive blistering on the shoulders of the tires.  Maybe if they had pushed them a couple more laps there would have been a failure, but the point is they had noticeable wear first.  There was not noticeable wear at Silverstone, and I don't remember Pirelli freaking out about the setup of the teams before the race either.

digitalpencil,gadgets,1390820390.0,"It depends on what you're using the monitor for but it is true. Not all panels are equal, (even those of the same display technology/manufacturer). The ones that typically make it into these monitors are A- which allow for dead/stuck pixels. You can get a really great monitor for a very competitive price but it's more of a gamble.

There's equally the difference in quality control and simple manufacturing quality. When they're this cheap and true IPS, they're cutting corners elsewhere. Bleeding is a common issue and most won't accept returns for things like bleeding.

Again, it depends on what your needs are. If you're just playing games or every day usage, they can be superb but it isn't fair to suggest they're exactly the same as monitors costing 2, 3 times the cost.

Because of the cross out it's clear that you are not affiliating with the Nazis and thus it's okay.

Another example is if you grandma was in the Bund deutscher Mädels (girlscouts of the Third Reich) and has a certificate about it, it's okay if you hang it somewhere in your house.

But yeah in general it's better not to have any symbols of it and you are good to go."

Everything else is gravy. Yes. You can even make maps starting off with just a pen and a piece of paper. It'd be just like doing one in GIMP, but with less futzing around with the settings. 

But maps aren't the important part of worldbuilding. They're the flashy part of worldbuilding. They're the look-what-I-did-in-class part of worldbuilding. It's the local equivalent of posting your artwork on your own fridge. Yeah, we'll all ooh and aah and complain about the rivers (NOTE: Learn about rivers, dude. It'll save you a world of grief later on.) but, in the end, few maps out there will actually tell you anything about the world you build except for gross geography. 

The most important part is the idea. It doesn't have to be a special idea. It doesn't need to be a grand idea. It doesn't even need to be an idea that would interest many people. It could be anything from ""What if the Gods of Evil win the war?"" to ""I wonder what a sentient earthworm species would be like."" to ""Has anyone ever heard of *orange* blood? Is there such a thing?""

It should be noted, that the Copyright for the book only goes until 31.12.2015, but it can be safely assumed that there will be other things the German and Bavarian state does to prevent the unedited printing and selling of the book at least in Germany.

The state of Bavaria gives permission to print special copies for educational purposes. I never had any of them in my hands, but I assume they are commented and edited. The printing and selling of an unedited version of ""Mein Kampf"" is beside the copyright infringement also an infringement of §§ 86, 86a and 130.

calexanderj,AskWomen,1390821056.0,"&gt; I guess the way I interpret the whole thing is that these sort of men think if they can get a girl on one ""date"" (even if she doesn't want to ""date,"" and even if getting her on the occasion takes manipulation) she'll see the light, fall head over heels... 

That's not entirely incorrect.  I think his thinking is that if you get to know him better, you're more likely to be open to dating him.

But I don't see how it's insulting unless you've already made it clear that you have no interest in him and that it's never going to happen. Which I get might be awkward for you to do if he hasn't made an overt move.

However, I've read more than a few comments from women on this site who have mentioned that they prefer dating guys that they are friends with or that they know fairly well as opposed to random people who have asked them out. So the idea that a woman would be more open to dating a guy after hanging out a few times isn't entirely without basis. And if a guy find himself attracted to a woman who feels that way, what are his options? Being forward may not work.

I think as long as the activity he invites you to ends up being as advertised (i.e. running with a little friendly banter) it's not really manipulation even though he may have an ulterior motive.   "

It's awesome, laid back, and since I am part of so many things nobody knows what I'm supposed to be working on so everyone thinks I work super hard. If I work five hours a day it's my own damn fault haha.

So I suppose I don't know how to get you to this strange niche I've made for myself out of a medley of skill and fierce opportunity driving. I can say though that if you like working with your hands now is a great time to do it. Electricians, pipefitters, boilermakers, sheet metal workers a, etc. "

MusingMagus,AskMen,1390821357.0,"This is going to be a long post.

&gt;Anyway, none of this is cool because I'm extremely lonely and I just wanna get laid already. 

I have a friend who used to be like this, and I'm going to tell you the same thing I told him: don't focus on sex.  You want to stop being lonely?  First, find friends.  You don't have to keep all of them.  Narrow it down to a core group you like.  Then, find a relationship.  With a few exceptions, nothing gets you steady sex like a healthy relationship.

So let's move on to the first thing: friends.

&gt;I live in a redneck farmtown in the middle of nowhere. /It's been a cold winter and I have to get around to work and such on foot and long bus rides.

Small town means a smaller pool of potential mates, and not having your own transportation means a smaller accessible area during certain times of day.  You can work around both of these, but they are problematic.  On the plus side, if you encounter the same people on a regular or semi-regular basis on public transportation (which is probably the case due to the area you live in), you now have a resource.  These are people you can become friends with.  Through them, you can access their friends and acquaintances, and through them, theirs, and so on.  With skill and some luck, you can move through their social circles, picking out people you want for yours.  Skill is the issue here, and I'll cover that next.

&gt;Like a lot of single guys, I do everything totally alone. Go to movies and concerts alone, even. I don't say more than a few words a day because there's no one there, and if there is it seems like nobody can even hear me.

No no no no NO.   Practice talking in front of a mirror.  Feel silly?  I don't give a fuck.  It helps prepare you for actual social situations.  A muscle you don't use will atrophy.  Conversational skills are similar in this regard.  Get used to talking.

&gt;My personality just doesn't click with others' easily. Different sense of humor, different way of looking at things, different tastes, and so on. Not that someone has to be the same as me in order to be my friend, but I feel just different enough that whenever I talk to most people, there's nothing there. I try to talk to coworkers and such but they're just totally different from me. They don't get my jokes, they respond to me with one word, or they pretend to give a shit about what I say before quickly changing the subject.

Tell us about yourself.  Not about your loneliness, or about how you want to get laid, or how you feel invisible.  Tell us what you find funny.  Is your humor immature?  Highbrow?  Dark?  Give examples.  You say you look at things differently.  How?  What things?  I see you care about animals, which probably does set you apart somewhat in small, ""redneck"" towns.  What other things do you view differently?  How do the people around you view them?  Why?  

Monosyllabic responses suck, and quick topic changes suck too.  I feel your pain.  However, you may be coming on too strong, or your coworkers may be too self absorbed to care.  It could also be your conversational style, but I have no way of knowing without actually talking to you.  

&gt;I'm 21 years old and have had no luck with men, ever. I'm good at hair and makeup, I have good hygiene, I don't smell. I am overweight, but not in a round way (if that makes sense). 

There are other factors to consider.  What is your posture like?  How do you walk?  You say you don't smell, but do you smell *nice*?

&gt;I'm taller than most girls (at 5'7"") and naturally built bigger but I don't think I'm built like a man. I've got obvious boobs/hip so I hope not.

How do you dress?  A girl with a skinny and feminine figure dressing masculine is largely viewed as attractive in all the places I've been to (and it helps them stand out from the pack), but a heavier masculine girl dressing masculine usually has the opposite effect.  I'm not saying you need to be all bows and lace, but if you think people aren't viewing you as a girl, give them a not-so-subtle reminder that you are one.  If it's warm out, show a little cleavage.  If it's cold, choose shirts that accentuate your womanly wiles.

&gt;I've considered I'm just exceptionally ugly. I've only been called pretty by older women. No guy has ever reacted positively to my appearance. In fact, on more than one occasion in my life, I've been told I'm scary -- like I look like I'm going to pull a knife on someone or knock them out or otherwise hurt them. Pretty severe bitchface, I guess. I try to smile and look pleasant but I keep getting those kinds of reactions.

When trying to smile, are you trying to force a smile, or are you recalling a past event that made you happy?  Don't do the first.  Some people can fake it, but most can't, and people can tell.  Fake smiles get bad reactions.  Find something you like that makes you happy (warm happy, not ha-ha happy, horny happy, etc.), and think about it.  Often.  Take that thought or memory, and dwell on it.  Sit in your room and contemplate it.  When you're familiar with it, practice recalling it quickly.  Practice sustaining it.  You'll feel silly, but it helps you.

Now, put yourself on paper.  If someone were to ask you ""Who are you?  Tell me what you like, why you like it, what you want to do in life, etc."", write down what the response would be.  Take anything negative out.  Make it less rambling, but not too short.  Practice saying it in front of your mirror.  Get familiar with it.  Watch yourself.  Now, recall that happy warmth.  Keep practicing.  Watch your mouth, your eyes, and your eyebrows.  Listen to your tone.  Hopefully, you'll see a difference.

If you've practiced to the point where you can do both of these successfully, you can now a.) trigger genuine warm affect when needed and b.) articulate to a stranger who you are and what you're like.

&gt;Food without animal products tastes bland and lacking in substance. For most of the week I eat rice, quinoa, and beans. /I'm just feeling disappointed with myself and frustrated with food. 

You may disagree with me on this one, but I think you should prioritize.  If lack of meat is tanking your mood, eat meat...just for now.  Think of it this way: you, individually, on a relatively short time scale, make no difference in the lives of what you're eating (provided it's being bought from a grocery store, and not slaughtered directly for your table).  They would die anyway.  They will continue to die when you go full vegan, and you will.  You're currently fighting a battle for your happiness, and anything that goes against that is an enemy, dissatisfaction as a result of diet included.  Feel free to ignore this if you want, but every person I've been with has been, when cranky from hunger or lack of preferred food, less appealing until that desire is met.

I realize this is a lot to take in, but there's more.  You should practice the give-and-take that comes with conversation.  Conversation is about both content and delivery.  Delivery has three parts: nonverbal (covered above), verbal (sort of covered above, mostly deals with having a pleasing tone of voice, volume, rate of speaking, pitch variance, etc.), and SPEED.  Speed is something you should practice if on the spot responding isn't something you're good at, which can easily stall and kill an otherwise healthy conversation.  If speed is an issue, talk to people online using IMing so you can respond to queries and such quickly.  When you're comfortable with this, move on to in-person conversation and phone conversation.

Feel free to respond or ask questions, as I'll be checking this later.  A picture would be nice, though it isn't necessary.  I will say, however, that not being conventionally attractive *is* a handicap.  It can be overcome in many ways (charisma, money, lack of more appealing options, etc.), but it is still a handicap.  I don't know if you fall into that boat or not, but I (and the other Redditors here) could respond with our subjective opinions."

Chocobean,Christianity,1390821464.0,"be careful with ""holier than Thou"" thinking. One can be a youth group leader and wear all sorts of Jesus gear and cry when you sing worship songs, and totally be living life for God as much as someone who only goes to Sunday and party every week and hang out with all non-Christian friends. I see that you've mentioned serving God. One can serve by simply being a good testimony to others. One can also serve by having lots of conversations about God, or enjoying the fruits of one's labour, appreciating rest, enjoying the physical body's pleasures....etc. So long as we do not sin, no pursuit or past time is more or less holy than anything else.....

Maybe you mean he has no prayer life? He doesn't value fellowship with other Christians? He doesn't serve in the community? Maybe at best that's an incompatibility with how you choose to express your faith. And maybe that's enough not to be in a relationship with the guy, sure, but be careful about judging others' relationship to God. 

I hope I have mistaken your posts. I don't see anything wrong with partying and having fun and having that be a contradiction with living life for God. Do you have any concrete examples, I mean, like, in the same situation, how would you, living for God, handle it differently than someone who is living for himself? 

On this side of death we are all living for ourselves, to varying degrees, even as we TRY to do actions that are glorifying to God. What does it mean to truly live ONLY for God? Even missionaries have to tend to their kids and enjoy a drink and sit by a warm fire and go out to a birthday party when given the choice, right? "

Rev. 22:17: “Let anyone hearing say: ‘Come!’ And let anyone thirsting come; let anyone that **wishes** take life’s water free.” (The choice is not foreordained; it is left to the individual.)

Rom. 2:4, 5: “Do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and long-suffering, because you do not know that the kindly quality of God is trying to lead you to repentance? But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath and of the revealing of God’s righteous judgment.” (There is no forcing of individuals to pursue a prescribed course. But there is accountability for what one does.)

* The security guards tried to steal things out of my carry-on luggage, only to give up when they realized I was with a group of 30+ people who were willing to back me up.
* A very fat woman with whom I spoke no languages in common sat next to me, refused to put her giant purse in the overhead bin, spilled her orange juice all over me (this was the first leg in a 36 hour transit so I had a sticky stain on my pants for over a day), and ignored me when I tried to indicate that I needed to use the restroom (I was seated at the window and she was in the aisle seat). She also smelled awful (like weeks-old BO and unbrushed teeth).
* When I finally got to Dubai, we got off the plane in one terminal and had to make our connection in another one, which was adjacent to it. Unfortunately, the shuttle bus that ferried people around the airport went in one direction only and it was the opposite direction that we wanted to go in so a 5 minute walk (if we had been allowed to walk between the buildings) turned into a 45 minute bus ride (Dubai airport is huge). The bus was packed like an Indian train car.
* The flight was pretty turbulent. That doesn't bother me but it did upset many of the two dozen young children that screamed for most of the 3-4 hour flight.
* They ran out of one of the meal choices and I got a vegetarian lasagna which burnt my mouth and gave me heartburn.

Probably not the worst experience out there, possibly not the absolute worst I ever had, but it's the one that stands out the most in my memory as it happened more recently. The two legs that followed were with Lufthansa and Air France and both were a comparative dream. One of the stewards on the Lufthansa flight noticed the stain on my pants and found some cleaning products for me to see if I could get it out, but the juice had been sitting for several hours at that point and was soaked in and dried beyond anything short of a full laundry cycle. I threw the pants away when I got home because the stain wouldn't lift, even after several washes (they were only cheap clothes that I wear for travelling so it wasn't a big loss). The final leg of the trip was with my county's national carrier, who, as usual, were about as friendly and efficient as a bag of wet cats."

I think this is part of your problem. You never really have had to struggle just to get basics like food and shelter, have you? Thus you have not learned to set goals and achieve them. 

&gt;  I put a lot of pressure on myself and whatever I achieve just doesn't feel enough.

Pressure means nothing unless you get results. Do you get results? Do you have any goals? How about saving for retirement? That's a good goal. Never count on the US gov't to help you. See Hurricane Katrina. 

Maybe you could volunteer at a food pantry or soup kitchen. Or help the elderly who can't get out of their house. Sign up with a church or other organization (so you don't look like some random stalker) and find out how you can help people. 
Focus on someone else and maybe then you will find your goals. 

Since I was homeless and hungry as a kid, my goals became crystal clear. If I didn't meet my goals to get food, I'd die. It was simple as that. We didn't have food pantries way back then in Smalltown Michigan. No social services.

With 2 stratios I was able to clear all sites, however the 8/10s overseers structure is a real pain, and some stages require flawless piloting (or warping out if you mess up).

3 Stratios is were things get really chill. Enough DPS to kill all the structures and overseers in a reasonable time and enough rep power for not having to rely on perfect speed tanking.

We've gone from movements asking ""What's wrong and how specifically can we fix it?"" to movements asking ""Who has it worst and how can we give them the means to beat people over the head with it?"" 

In the same way that the Mens Rights movement has had a crippling inability to quash the sort of closet misogynists who use the movement as an attempt to drag women back to the 50's or worse, current Feminism has the bad habit of antagonizing its moderates rather than its extremists. A person saying they believe rape culture is a flawed way of representing how modern society responds to rape is antagonized much more significantly than a TERF or lesbian-separatist feminist. It's things like that that push both movements towards extremism and leave both of them as disquietingly powerful evidence of horseshoe theory. "

At the very least they should know whether they want to keep seeing you, thereby picking up a third year option, or letting you go. I mean if a team doesn't think you are worth the price tag you're selling at, shouldn't you get a chance to find one who does?

It's ridiculous that a guy like Watt or Cam, who are undoubtedly franchise players, get paid like rookies 4 years into the league. It's even more ridiculous that a team can pick up his option then franchise tag him for another two years. 

A team can literally pay nothing (relative to what those guys should be getting paid) for a player until he's 28/29. 

It's why I don't like the scale, and the draft in general. It's a way for teams to control incoming talent and keep them cheap. Sure, if we undid those two things, some rookies would get ridiculous contracts, but If a team sees fit to do it, who's got the right to stop them."
Geohump,politics,1390823478.0,"&gt; Target**'**s breach was inside the POS not the actual payment terminal**,** (based on what evidence I have seen).

However, once the card data**,** EMV or not leaves the point of capture, and makes its way via **T**arget**'**s systems to the bank**,** it is in the clear unless they are using some form of end to end encryption that starts at the point of capture.

My understanding is that the devices that were compromised were the credit card terminals, which, because of the time I spent working at VeriFone, I call the ""POS"". (My terminology may not match yours, which happens a lot)

Inside the credit card terminal, the user's card data has to be in the clear at some point in time,  before it is sent to the Card processor, (not the Bank), for authorization. (The processor may contact the bank, and usually does for debit card).

When the user's data is in the clear, a compromised card terminal can record the info, and may even send it anywhere.  **The same is true for the cash register, if the user's card data is ever present within it, and if it has been compromised.**.

They still have enjoyment, of honor, of wanting happiness  for themselves and admiration for others. That sounds like creatures from the same God to me. 

 It doesn't make sense for there to be creatures that are completely and utterly bad. Okay so they hate everyone other than themselves: they love themselves, excellent. They hate all existence including their own: then hurting themselves/others is ""doing the right thing""---they're creatures who wan to do the right thing and follow a logical pattern of desires and behaviour, excellent.

CSLewis made this point, someone, that badness can't exist only for its own sake. Good, however, can exist for its own sake. Evil is only the absence of Good, it is not something that exists outside of good.

Feminism defines itself as the sole movement about gender equity and equality when it's advantageous to do so. By its own assertions, anyone who disagrees with or is critical of perceived flaws in anything modern Feminism espouses, intersectionality, rape culture, Patriarchy, microagressions, etc. is labeled a misogynist. The problem I have with the current Feminist movement is that it creates a culture of invalidation. You aren't a 'real' Feminist unless you take all of the ideological assumptions and concepts that Feminism demands at face value, even when those do nothing to service or actually run contrary to the idea of gender equity and equality.

Once, he was auditioning for a TV ad and he showed me his ""typical kiwi accent"" that he was ""putting on"" for it - it sounded MUCH more natural and it took so much will-power not to say, ""why don't you just talk like that all the time?!"" 

He believed in old fashioned manners and chivalry. 

We lost touch over the years and recently ran into each other at an opera. He texted me afterwards and he did this thing where he unnecessarily said things in a strange way... like, ""Hello there, do you perchance have plans this fri / sat / sun?"" JUST SAY ""WEEKEND""! After I told him I was hanging with my boyfriend he never replied and I haven't heard from him since. 

He wore fedoras with jeans.

He was socially awkward in some ways (see above) but confident and outgoing in general. He had no problem talking to women as he spent a lot of time with them in musicals and operas. However, I do remember once when I told him I broke up with my boyfriend he said something like, ""So are you now finally going to give me a chance?"" I was like... dude, what the fuck?

Though, while the Gameboy game was popular, it was more so the card game than anything. The fields had kids in circles playing with the cards during recess, trades went on all throughout lunch, and Pokemon was the subject of conversation for most of my classmates at the time. Conversations of who could beat who were rampant and any kid that brought a card sheet was instantly swarmed with kids wanting to try it out.

I wasn't allowed to do anything with Pokemon, and it made me incredibly lonely for a while since I couldn't talk with many people for long because conversation would always shift to Pokemon; What had happened on the last episode of the show, and musing about what would happen next... Showing off Pokemon swag, toys, and other new things they got. I had no knowledge of any of it, nor was I allowed to gain any.

What this means for you is improved ROI: Less labor for you, more enjoyment for him.

The foreskin's nerve endings specialize in stretch-and-release, like the nerve endings in your lips. You know how good it feels when you're kissing and your guy manipulates your lips with his lips and tongue? It's the same when your lips and tongue work on his foreskin.

Rolling the skin with your hand stimulates those nerve endings, too, peeling the glans then rolling it closed again. Bonus: When it's closed, slide your tongue in between the foreskin and glans. Swirl. You may have to pause occasionally for him to stop shaking. ;-)

The glans likes gentle, wet friction. (It can be touched dry, but only completely dry. Even a little moisture will make your fingers feel like erasers.)

Also, he'll have a frenulum, whereas most circumcised guys don't. That's the raised strip connecting the underside of his glans to his foreskin. It's very, very sensitive to direct stimulation.

I do it in an extremely simple way which is either only buy players that are transfer listed so that I'm getting a player already advertised as being undervalued or I look for a player that has the major attributes I need. My most recent was a right-back I bought for 8mil from Inter. They were playing a 3-5-2 formation so had no use for him but his best stats made him look like an excellent wingback. He was only worth 5mil to Inter but now that I've bought him and he's playing he's valued at 20mil. Now if i decided to sell him to any other team who uses a right back or a wingback they will pay at least 15mil. I'll double my money and get use out of him, win win for me."

Carr0t,networking,1390824254.0,"We've actually found the reverse. We had a couple of very old sites with shitty cat3 wiring that then went to a 100 pair telco cable back to a comms, where it was punched onto the back of wallmount panels (these are only capable of 10full, but were put in back when 10full was a big thing. We still had most places with connectivity running over coax or even serial connections back to a central mainframe).

Anyway, over time we found more and more laptops and desktops failing to work at all on these lines. Sure, cable degredation, but whenever we hauled out with our expensive work-provided Dell laptops we never had any problems. All the complaints were from people with really low end cheap-and-nasty laptops/desktops. I can only assume they were running right at the limits of what was required to meet spec, to save pennies, and thus couldn't cope with these shitty lines, whereas more expensive machines had more capability to deal with shitty cabling by upping the power or whatever.

It's all well and good saying that it hurts you when he does it or that it's affecting your mental health, but you should have outlined your boundaries long before now and before you allowed him to speak sexually to others.

If you want to give him an ultimatum, then you need to be clear. You need to tell him exactly what you want from him and that what you've previously said is okay, is now not okay. 

Overall though, I just think you're incompatible with him. He's bisexual, and is interested in trying out being with a man whilst still in a relationship with you. You can't accept that, which is perfectly fine, so that's the thing you need to address when you talk to him."

[Mord är ett uppsåtligt dödande av en annan **människa**](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mord), slakt av djur är inte mord

&gt;inser att separera inte är lika med diskriminera (är skilda pojk- och flickomklädningsrum också diskriminering?)

[Diskriminering är, i sin bredaste definition, att skilja mellan saker, t ex information, ting, djur eller människor. Diskriminering kan vara positivt, värdeneutralt eller negativt.](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diskriminering) Att separera efter kön är precis att diskriminera mellan kön. Som jag tar upp i samband med alkohol längre ner så hänvisar jag här till skillnaden mellan att introducera nya mönster jämfört med att eliminera existerande mönster/beteenden

---

&gt;har den pragmatiska insikten att djur behandlas som skit i Sverige och i praktiken torteras hela sina liv

[stämmer inte och strävan är att sådan behandling inte får förekomma](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djurskydd), det är inte att gå i rätt riktning att introducera avsiktlig tortyr ovanpå eventuella existerande problem

&gt;inser att vi bör ha respekt för svenska medborgares religiösa föreställningar

nej vi kan inte ha ""religiös inställning"" i åtanke när vi formar vårat samhälle

min religiösa inställning är kanske t.ex. att din religiösa inställning inte ska behandlas med respekt, vems religiösa inställning ska vi respektera? svar: ingens

&gt; vi är knappst rationella i övrigt i samhället

bara för att ett system inte är perfekt betyder inte det att vi ska göra det mindre perfekt eller sluta sträva mot ett bättre system

&gt;varför vara tokrationella just när det gäller religion?

det finns inte grader av rationalitet, man är antingen rationell eller inte - tokrationell är inte mer rationellt än vanlig rationalitet. Vi ska vara rationella i alla avseenden, inkluderat religion.

&gt;speciellt när det inte skadar någon

förutom barnen som inte får bada med varandra eller djuren som torteras

&gt;i motsats till exempel till att vi tillåter alkohol, som skulle kunna beskrivas som djupt irrationellt och skadligt

för det första är alkohol en existerande vana i samhället, att fasa ut existerande vanor är inte jämförbart med att introducera nya på sättet du jämför dem. Sedan kan jag ju tillägga att man har påvisat positiva hälsoeffekter av lagom alkoholkonsumption (dvs. inte helgdrickande utan vardagsdrickande). Att påstå att försäljningen av alkohol är irrationellt är i sig irrationellt, och likgiltigt med att säga att det är irrationellt att sälja sömnpiller ""för om man hetskonsumerar får man negativa effekter"" eller om du vill vara absurd (vilket du verkar tycka om) så gäller det även för vatten.


**PS** jag säger inte att det inte ska vara våran strävan att ändra eventuellt negativa existerande normer, mönster, eller beteenden - bara att det inte är jämförbart med att introducera nya negativa normer, mönster, eller beteenden"

tallulahblue,AskWomen,1390825040.0,"Theatre kid here. I think the theatre guys are successful for several reasons.

1) They are a minority. Every musical / drama group I have been a part of, the women outnumbered the men. They are always struggling to find dudes to get involved. When there are only a few guys and tons of girls, things are in their favour. In the musicals I've been in, straight guys seem even rarer. 

2) They spend a TON of time together. Rehearsals three times a week. Everybody gets to know each other really well and get close.

3) They have a shared passion with theatre girls - love of the stage, playtexts, songs, etc. 

4) They are confident! All that public speaking, dressing up silly, pretending to be other people, theatre sports / games ... it all leads to guys being unafraid to joke around and be goofy... which theatre girls tend to like as they are often the same. 

It's funny, because I was just mentioning a fedora-wearing m'lady-saying guy in this thread... met him through theatre. 

In my experience he was the minority though. Most theatre guys had all of the above, but no fedora or m'lady. Just excessive energy, a silly, goofy personality, and a loud mouth. I can definitely see why this would be annoying to non-theatre people. Whenever I go to ""theatre parties' nowadays I have so much fun but feel *really* sorry for my non-theatre boyfriend at times. Everyone has big personalities!

IME it doesn't work that way at all. I want casual sex, she wants casual sex, we have casual sex. It's not a trade.

However, the rest of the facts sound like it wasn't actually his design that caused the problem - despite being unlicensed, he (may well have) created a good design, but the builders didn't follow it in some key ways: nails were used instead of bolts, steps that were supposed to be a counterweight were never attached, and a sign showing the maximum capacity of five people was never put up.

It was also never permitted/inspected.  All of this sums up to sound like the Department of Conservation had a sloppy approach to the whole thing.

Geohump,atheism,1390825502.0,"You have missed the point of what a paradox is.

Of **course** Achilles will overtake the turtle, that's not even in question. (pardon me, but duh...). 

&gt;Its not a paradox. Achilles will overtake the turtle.

Yes Achilles will overtake the turtle, that is WHY ""*the proof that shows that he can't*"", is a paradox! If Achilles couldn't overtake the turtle, it wouldn't be a paradox.

The paradox is the apparent logical proof that Achilles cannot overtake the turtle.  We know this thing to be untrue, and yet we can construct a logical proof that shows that it is true, which conflicts with reality.  

This is the point of Zeno's illustrations! 

So what we now know is that a **logical paradox has no intrinsic value of its own**. The mere  existence of a paradox indicates nothing more than the fact that we can arrange words in such a fashion that we can create statements that are logically consistent, and appear true, but actually have **NO IMPACT ON,  OR RELATIONSHIP WITH REALITY.**

Hence ""Can God create a rock so heavy He can't lift it?"" is merely a paradox, and it has no relationship with reality, nor impact upon it.  Its nothing more than a construct of words that, while logically consistent, have no bearing on reality. Hence, I can ask when is red blue (logically consistent), but having no bearing on or impact with reality.  I can even make a statement ""red is blue"" and that statement, is logically consistent and ""true"" within the syntax of the language, but like the turtle's victory over Achilles, totally untrue. 

A paradox is nothing more than an artifact of language that allows us to create logically consistent statements, which are syntactically valid, or 'true', but are false in reality.

Please note that this is not a defense of God's existence. It is merely pointing out that a paradox is only useful as a tool for examining the logic rules of models. And since we humans use models to explain things, they are useful as tools to deepen our understanding.  But the mere existence of a paradoxical statement has no **actual** relationship to reality.

This is one of the two main things we need to learn as ACoNs, the other being that we are not 'worthless devil children' as we were taught by our nparents.  

Like /u/Lordica and others have said: give this a shot and just go slow.  No need to rush into a sexual relationship, just let things happen as you both feel comfortable.  If it takes you long then so be it.  That's NOTHING to be ashamed about.  As ACoNs we have to unlearn 18+ years of bad parenting/training in a (relatively) short time and it's hard to do.  When/if issues come up then explain the why to her and see if she understands.  If she's the right person then she will.  

Do remember this, for people from 'normal' families it is sometimes hard to understand where people like us are coming from.  I guess you could call it a 'reverse-FLEA'.

SerPuissance,worldnews,1390825738.0,"The people whom I see complaining most about high income tax reform and defend the ""worked hard to get obscenely rich"" fallacy are the ones who cling most desperately to the hope that one day they might be one of those wealthy people. 

It's mostly an American thing from what I can see, it does go on in Europe but to a lesser extent. It's not very common at all in the UK - there is an entrenched working and middle class (despite the ever changing boundaries) who have no trouble supporting tax reform and poilcy aimed at wealth equality because they know damned well that they aren't part of the new aristocracy and never will be. I think - and I mean this with no disrespect - that a great many Americans live in the eternal hope that they will make it big one day, and therefore reject any thinking that might endanger the state of existence when they do get that far. 

America certainly is a land of great opportunity, and you can carve out a great living for yourself through cleverness, graft and savvy. Many a small store owner has ended up worth a few million. But to be super rich, part of that true 1% - it takes many more cards than most people could ever be dealt. The self made billionaire is still a rare creature, the vast majority had helping hands and people need to recognise that and build it into their perception of the realities of becoming very wealthy.

I remember getting in bed with my mom (was still very young, so sleeping in the bed with a parent wasn't weird), and things were normal when I fell asleep.  I woke up and my mom rolled over, and her face was all melty and her mouth was wide-open in a silent scream.

ClimbingWolfBear,AskReddit,1390826352.0,"I did! I ended up in a pretty bad situation. I was a transfer, and one of the few who I had a passion for camping, the outdoors, and Scouting. The leaders were trying to keep me around, and didn't trust that I would stay with them after my Eagle, so they spent a year pulling every excuse they could to avoid signing off on my project.

So, because they asked me for increased participation, I sacrificed my church obligations to go on one camping trip in the beginning of the summer, and ended up getting pneumonia from that. In turn, I had to pull out of the summer camp, and those incidents would have been great excuses to ""prove"" I needed more time developing my leadership skills. I ended up getting a ton of shit for not going to the summer camp as it was.

7 months after I finished my project, they had me go back and make even more improvements (like waterproofing the already pressure treated lumber). After that, it was Christmas time, and they told me that they needed to get the troop committee together to review my Eagle project report to determine if the SM could sign off on it.

When that happened, I was done. I took one of the other transfers who was tired of this shit, one of the ASMs who had been supervising my project, and we went to a McDonalds on Christmas Eve and signed the paperwork to start a Venture Crew.

I secured donations from a lot of people, got the finances all set up, got a meeting place from my church, and got the Crew set up. The goal of the Crew was to extend Scouting to those who would be unable to normally experience it. We had contacts with a couple local group foster homes, and set up special conditions so that those kids could come to meetings and campouts. For those who couldn't afford it, we had a fund set up to pay for that, supported by popcorn sales and donations. I ended up being the first person in my council to ever be awarded the Venturing Leadership Award. And honestly, I'm more proud of what I did to earn that then what I did for my Eagle."

rynchpln,islam,1390826412.0,"Linguistically we know Κυριος in the time of Christ could be applied to either God **or** to a person of authority. It always implied the latter, but only occasionally the former. However, the ambiguity was present in the noun itself. It is different from what you think of as Lord (where it always means god to you when connected with the name Jesus). However, it was an interpretative possibility that evidently the early church struggled over. The author of Romans did not clarify exactly which meaning of Κυριος he intended to use. This means that Muslims could say Κύριον Ἰησοῦν and still linguistically be comfortably within the bounds of orthodoxy.

He is not just one of many prophets he has been given a unique role among all the prophets. No other prophet is the Word, the Spirit of God, the Messiah, returning from heaven before judgement. Nevertheless he isn't greater than the other prophets. He merely fulfills a unique part of God's plan.

(I know you didn't say this next part. I was in an extremely conservative reformed environment before and this was a common assumption. However, the Reformed tradition is very diverse so it could a strawman.) To think that Muslims don't believe in Jesus is to ignore historical context. We know historically one of the sharpest and earliest debates in the early church was the relation to Jesus with God.  Church Fathers taking a variety of opinions before Constantinian Christianity began to enforce Trinitarianism. The disciples of Jesus never heard the word Trinity so you cannot say they believed in it. They never said the word ὁμοούσιος. So Muslims actually represent an entire portion of early Christian beliefs concerning Christ that in some respects are closer to early Christianity than are modern Christians. "

Ask your claim adjuster to fight it for you, its their job. Do this first, they can better advise you on if you can get more money or if its a good idea to take the deal. 

If you only contacted the other drivers insurance read below

Would you happen to happen pictures of your damage and their damage? I will assume no for now. I personally will take the deal because you are getting something in your favor. There is no hard evidence to prove your claim or their claim: pictures and police report. 

If you do have pictures of the damage, most damages on a car shows usually shows who is at fault (angle of damage and how much paint scraped off). A insurance damage analysis report would help your case a lot. This is where you have a chance of suing the other person for more money.

It's nice because that commonality is often a beautiful way to connect with others, and inevitably becomes nostalgia that the entire group can enjoy.

Her spell schools are Light and Prime, which gives her 0 board clears against rushes, this wouldn't neccessarily be a problem but almost every early drop for academy is focused on defense, in fact there are only 2 creatures in the 1-2 cost range with 2 attack, and for 3 cost there are 2 creatures with more than 2 and they both cost to maintain. Her ability suggests that she's a milling hero, but the milling creatures have very low attack for their cost, along with 0 retaliation and not a big amount of health. In short, it's very hard to gain, and keep board control with her, I've tried a lot of different builds with her but they all fall short against Ishuma's, Crag Hacks, and even Garrant rushes as she always gets overwhelmed with creatures she can't handle.

HoV on the other hand does a lot better with Dark Magic, she also has no board clears, but most players are hesistant to play big creatures against dark magic unless they have some ""untargetable"" card handy which buys you time to drop milling creatures.

Thom0,drums,1390827504.0,"In the pocket is a bullshit term. When I was studying music and performance in a top music college this fucking term was thrown around constantly by tutors. It meant something different every time and they expected you to understand what you were doing wrong via magic telepathy.

I've literally seen guys fail an audition or an exam because that specific tutor felt they weren't in the pocket, that same student could do the exact same performance for another tutor and be passed. 


Just say the beat is tasty, just say they have a nice groove or a good feel for time. Use actual words that express something constant, stop using a vague term that could mean anything and is totally subjective. 

I know what its supposed to mean, at least my impression of in the pocket is correct for me. In my opinion Darren King is in the pocket, an old tutor of mine thought he was awful.


I went to a Bernard Purdie clinic with a friend of mine a few years ago, my friend asked him what does in the pocket actually mean. Purdie suddenly became dead serious, looked at my friend dead in the eyes, stood up, reached into his pocket and threw a massive stack of cash onto the floor. He then said really seriously ""Thats what in the pocket means""."

HalfysReddit,AskMen,1390827667.0,"It's because some of us really desired that sex and were left fiending for significant stretches of time.

So like for me, I've been sexually aware since before I was making memories. I started jacking it regularly at seven. I was a horny motherfucker, but guess what? People my age were still going on about cooties and shit. Hit teen years, people start partnering up, I find that being overweight and having a stutter isn't exactly sexy.

I did eventually find a really cool girl that I dated and we had sex, then we broke up, life happened, and I'm actually now a very eligible bachelor nowadays.

But here's the thing, and I fully acknowledge that this is not healthy thinking, but I spent over a decade of my formative years sexually frustrated. As such, I now find myself a bit jealous of those who lived the sort of life I wanted. It's not a problem 99% of the time, but if a given girl had a past that made me jealous, well that jealousy is going to be a relationship-killer. I don't fault her, she didn't do anything wrong, and I would have done the exact same thing (if not more) given that position, but it's unlikely that we're compatible relationship-wise.

So truly, it's not her, it's me. It's not slut-shaming, it's an inability to cope with jealousy. Granted, given maybe just some more time to mature or some therapy or whatever, I might get past all this. If it weren't for the jealousy, sexual history wouldn't even be a consideration."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390827810.0,"I believe it is murder.

But I'm also okay with it.

This doesn't cause my brain to explode or cause me any discomfort whatsoever, because I think sometimes murder is necessary, or unavoidable, or even deserved (not in this case, but in others).

(I believe that there are different words about killing people meant to describe different situations/intent, and maybe ""murder is the wrong word for what I think. But I'm ignoring that.)

I absolutely believe abortion kills a living human.

I just think that there are some situations in which humans have to be killed, and am not interested in policing those around me on this issue.

I can envision plenty of scenarios in which I am okay with the killing of this poor helpless creature, so I know they exist. Timing is a real problem for abortion, and within these scenarios, I believe needing to prove it's okay could take time that the woman doesn't have.  And I'm not sure I can envision *every possible* deserved scenario, so I don't want some list that I, or anyone else, comes up with to be the only okay list.

I understand that there are, perhaps many many times when babies are killed that I don't like or agree is okay.

But I am willing to accept that cost for the sake of the ones that I do. 

Maybe it is bad of me to value personal liberties of one above the lives of others, but I do. To value lives over personal liberty, would take a complete restructuring of my philosophy, and day to day living. I have absolutely zero interest in that. "

silverionmox,europe,1390828097.0,"&gt;By nature the EU can only get bigger and more expensive, even though we have very advanced technology, politicians and statists will never make the state smaller or more efficient.

As it is, the EU does quite a lot of work with the 1% of European GDP it uses. The inefficient parts are mostly there because national governments insist on retaining powers they can't effectively wield anyway: of course you're going to end up duplicating a lot. You name me an example of EU inefficiency, and I'll show you where national governments block improving the situation.

&gt;A good example of this would be when the UK agreed to halve its rebate from the EU, under the previous Labour government. In return France would halve the CAP it received, and all the saved money would go to more deserving countries for development, infrastructure building, education and more deserving farmers. 

You're still thinking in terms of an bickering between countries: newsflash: CAP money hasn't been allotted per country for decades. It already distributes money among individual farmers. Feel free to pull the cart to make the distribution rules better, instead of complaining with your hands in your pockets while the other people do the work."

I use the Unitarian-Universalist flair because i have been a Member, (and leader in) of the UU congregation and there is no flair for my personal faith.  But I felt the need for a ""bumper sticker"" whilst in here. :-) 

I am not a Unitarian. In part because I don't find it to be well enough defied and in part because all Unitarian congregations merged and are now Unitarian-Universalist congregations and so it could be argued that there is no such thing as a Unitarian congregation. (But that does not negate the idea that individual Unitarians can exist. Would that make those individuals recursive Unitarians?   :-D  )

&gt;Also, are you personally able to achieve this?

I have experienced it. It is truly remarkable, and very desirable and possibly highly addictive.

Can I 'will myself' into this state?  

No.  I came into it quite by chance. If I could will myself into that state, I would do so.   There are Buddhist monks (and others) who can put themselves into this state, but apparently this requires some training and practice in meditation.

nyneve,Dreams,1390828125.0,"Sorry for the late reply; I hadn't checked Reddit in a while. I really enjoy doing dream interpretations, so if you don't mind I'll just do that for you here.

It sounds like something you went through with your girlfriend that you kind of, but not really anticipated and would have bad consequences to it. You thought you two got through it alright, but you've realized it has changed everything. It was particuarly difficult for your girlfriend who lost her personal integrity/voice in the process. Seeing her like that made you examine yourself and you realized that you were pretty damaged from it, too. Now that you realize it, you're trying to come closer to your girlfriend which you're hopeful about, but I think you think she moved on quicker than you and so you're not really sure what's going to happen next. 

Anyway, take it all with a grain of salt. I got all of this from the symbols in your dream (car, road, bridge, water, death, light, darkness, high, etc) and how the scenario played itself out. As a side note, I don't know if this is true or not but it looks like you view your girlfriend as your life partner."

In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb to say watching *anyone* stream is going to be detrimental.

Canadairy,farming,1390828541.0,"Partly it's to achieve business' goals, but a lot of it is to achieve one of governments main goals - cheap, consistent food for the masses. So there's incentive to get hyper-efficient and wildly overproduce. But in order to keep too many farmers from going bankrupt all at once when they sink the prices, government needs to have all kinds of ways to try to counteract that. It's a major balancing act. 

Here in Canada we have supply management for the dairy and poultry sectors. It sets a quota that farms have to buy if they want to sell those products. People outside these sectors like to scream about it being unfair to small farms, but there are only 3 main processors of milk in the country. That gives them huge clout to drive down prices, and supply management works to counter that by giving dairy farmers a unified voice in sales."

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1390828642.0,"Licensed guns for people who actually need them, like police or veterinarians. Why would a normal person like to own a gun? For fun? To ""shoot at range""? All shooting places (to birds or at range) most probably have a very good system of providing guns for those sports. What's the point in changing the law and putting more guns on the market?

I find it completely for an average person to own a gun. Guns are the deadliest weapon possible, where killing yourself of someone else is the easiest. All governments should have very tight gun control and average citizen shouldn't be allowed to possess a gun without an actual proper reason.

I bet, if in USA they would withdraw guns in general and made proper control of the licenses ones it would make a huge difference with gun crime. I know some people need to defend themselves, like some remote ranch or against wild animals. Two barrel shotgun is more than enough for such, no need for whole arsenal."

Ralkir,changemyview,1390828799.0,"My comment is going to be in the context of Starcraft 2 (RTS) and rushing. 

The thing about this game is when people play it they are trying to measure something. Who is the better player. If I challenged one the SC2 pros and did some sort of cheese (ie. Cannon rush) and won, is it demonstrative of me being a better player? Absolutely not, I took a very easy and replicable strategy, that requires little to no skill at the game and won the game. In that sense it is cheap and cheesey. 

To illustrate this I'll use an analogy. We have two runners about to go for a race. One is Bolt and the other some unknown person that thinks they can beat Bolt. So they are on a circular track (say 600m) and they say the first person to cross this line wins. Only the line is only 50m behind them. So at the start of the race bolt takes off around the full track, and the other person turns around and only has to run 50m. That person obviously won under the parameters of ""crossing the line first"". But is that person really the faster runner?

That is what they mean for cheap strategies. They lack the skill that people want to see measured amongst each other. In that sense, cheap strategies certainly do exist. "

seanomenon,stopdrinking,1390828865.0,"Elope. Weddings suck, bigtime. There's a reason everyone associates weddings with lots of drinking: because they suck. My own wedding was the single biggest test to my sobriety I've been through. The whole experience is full of people telling you what you *have* to do, then handing you a bill for it, followed by a drink. 

Here's the thing: you don't *have* to do any of it. OK, you need to make sure the wedding is legal and proper in your municipality, and get the paperwork filed properly. You do have to do that. Everything else I heard I *had* to do was actually someone's fantasy. It can be very helpful to remember that. You don't have to wear an expensive dress, you don't have to have a rehearsal dinner, you don't have to do it in June or on a weekend. It's your party, you can do what you want to. A lot of the pressure to make relatives happy comes from the fact that they are paying for things. If you are being pressure that way, guess what? You don't need to do the things they are paying for. A rehearsal dinner isn't a requirement, and if its happening, you don't have to be there.

In my experience, it is best to address it before plans are made and non-refundable deposits have been paid. Have a serious talk about drinking and bars and this dreaded rehearsal dinner before the plans are solidified. Its probably too much to ask to make it completely dry, but you can absolutely ask not do it in a watering hole.

And you can always just go to city hall and enjoy an awesome honeymoon. The families don't have to be present. If they know this is an option in your mind, then are much more likely to chill the fuck out on this stuff.

However, assuming you do go through with the rehearsal dinner and big wedding, here are some things that helped me:

+ have a plan for that dinner. Know when everyone will arrive, when the rehearsal will take place, when food will be served and what the food will be. Are toasts expected? When will they happen. Don't leave it up to a bunch of boozers, because there will be hours of drinking involved. Insist on knowing the plan. Play the bridezilla card if you have to. (Sadly, us grooms don't get this option.)

+ allow yourself breaks. Get out of that room once in a while. Get a breath of fresh air for a minute. 

+ talk to the person running the catering at any event. Make sure they will have plenty of your preferred soft drink. If there are servers, it's really nice when they know not to keep shoving champagne in your face.

+ If its devolving into a boozy drunken slurfest, don't be afraid to just leave. You have a lot to do, you aren't feeling well, you need your beauty sleep. If people are going to push you into events you don't want, then you don't need to be obligated to stay until the bitter end. 

Seriously, though, just elope.

Science isn't out there to play nice and make people feel better about their beliefs. Its goal is to find the unbiased truth, or the best answer given the evidence. This also means that everything will be given a shot to prove itself, and creationism has had significantly more than one, each time failing big time.

&gt;stating that both sides had potential flaws and neither were iron-clad. 

Please don't get confused and think interpret a lack of certainty in some areas as a flaw, and please don't think ""some flaws/non-iron clad"" is an accurate description of creationism. Creationism has many,many scientific flaws.

&gt;If you are certain about your view, then a debate shouldn't change that or worry you

Scientists are certain that spontaneous generation has no evidence and is not a valid theory; you don't see then going around in public debates trying to argue it.

rageagainsthevagene,tall,1390829036.0,"You know, that's a really interesting question. I've only dated two men that were taller than me and when I had my first - omg - it changed my life. ha. I laugh now, but I had never known the feeling of someone wrapping their arms around me and literally engulfing me. I could hug him without being afraid of breaking him in two. 

The thought of being with a man taller than me was an anomaly in my love life until I went to college. So we'll start with b) attractive. Incredible bottom-of-my-dna-nurturingly attractive. Just the feeling of safety that I felt, with arms completely wrapped around me-- like a strange sense of protection that I had never felt before...oh man, it fulfilled every childhood disney princess fantasy I had. Every movie where the woman is swept literally off her feet and into her man's arms-- I would think to myself, if someone poor bastard tries to cradle my 190-pound ass he is going to fall over or throw his back out. 

But also a) intimidating. I do find it extremely intimidating to talk to tall men. In fact, I think part of my early preference to date shorter men was because I felt physically in charge, like more intimidating (maybe I could scare a man into loving me?ha) -- even if he was strong or dominant, I felt like it was easier to be aggressive with them. Kind of strange I guess. wow, that was probably way more life story than you bargained for. sorry!!"

It was then that the Golden throne was modified to keep the big E alive, so after 10,000 years, the smartest people in the Imperium are long dead, nobody has a clue how to fix the damn thing and pieces are breaking down.

hubeijames,DotA2,1390829446.0,"Damn, got to this thread too late to avoid this misconception from being upvoted. I thought we were past this.

Chinese gamers, for the most part, do not play on their own computers. Having to pay $400/600 for a Dota 2-capable desktop/laptop is not a barrier to entry because everybody plays their games in netcafes. Not having solid, reliable internet at home is not a barrier to entry because everybody plays their games in netcafes. 

And no, it is very unlikely that there are many players who cannot play Dota 2 because no local netcafes has computers that can run Dota 2. If your computers can't run Dota 2 on minimum specs, they can't run any of the popular MMOs or FPSes that Chinese players like to play, either. Maybe there are some shitty 2 RMB/hr netcafes in poorer/rural areas that have only cheap, 5 year old computers that can only run LoL and WC3 Dota, but my guess is Valve/Perfect World isn't terribly concerned about capturing that market.

As for why Dota 2 is still small, my guess is Perfect World's server capacity is still pretty small, and they haven't been out of beta long, so their distribution to netcafes is going at a deliberately slow pace. I've been out of China several months and haven't had the opportunity to check out if Dota 2 is available in every neighborhood netcafe, but my guess is not. 

It was never realistic to expect Dota 2 to explode in China overnight. Let's wait 2 years before panicking."

I agree Mathis wasn't a double agent.  However, I disagree and think Vesper knew it wasn't Mathis sending the text messages.  She is the one who fed the info to LeChiffre that Bond knew his Tell.  She knows the account number, and just needs Bond to give up the passcode to get the money. Because in the end she knows that is all that the orginization (later identified as Quantum) is after.  LeChiffre is just a piece on the board to them.  Getting the money back is the main objective for them.  They know that LeChiffre is already burned by MI6 and probably know the CIA is on to him as well.  So they can use Vesper to retrieve the money, and LeChiffre will hopefully get killed by the Ugandans before being brought in. However if he is brought in, they ~~know~~ *think* they can turn Bond by using Vesper as a Honeypot.  

Instead, LeChiffre puts his plan into action, and tells Vesper to meet him.  The story of Mathis needing to speak to her was just a cover.  She DOESN'T know or suspect she will be used by kidnapping.  As far as she is concerned, she can still seduce Bond and take his money.  That way the man she has fallen for gets to live.

That is why LeChiffre was killed.  Not because he lost the poker game, but because he attempted to torture Bond and take the money back.  If he hadn't, Quantum would have come out on top one way or another. Either the Ugandans kill LeChiffre, and they keep Vesper as a honeypot for Bond. Or, LeChiffre is captured, the money is reclaimed either way, and Vesper turns Bond.   LeChiffre attempting to steal the money back, and presumably go to ground with it, forces them to kill LeChiffre.  Mathis was always the scapegoat, maybe because he was known to be a Do-Gooder (as evidenced with his removal of the police chief by exposing his crimes), and couldn't be bought."

HalfysReddit,AskMen,1390829642.0,"Alright, here's what's up OP:

Your chick actually has a pretty low number if it's only three, the mean I think is six or so. I'm a twenty three year old dude who's probably going to hit twenty by the end of the year.

Your chick didn't tell you about her past because she feared how it would affect the relationship, which is apparently not without merit. She probably also feared judgment from you, but I gotta say OP you seem to be taking this calmly. She knows you're religious and you just told her about your own very conservative sexual history, of course she's going to feel some pressure to conform to what your ideal most likely was.

Does that mean it was cool of her to lie about it? No. But how long have you two been dating? To be completely honest, if it's been less than a few months I wouldn't be angry about the lie. It's uncool, but whatever. If it's been six months or longer, I'd be upset by this too OP, not because of the history but because of the lie.

OP, it seems like you've got some naive thought patterns, some insecurities, and other mental blocks to work through. I do suggest counseling regardless of whatever else you do. I wish you and your woman well OP.

Edit: You *really* need to talk to her about this, too."

If your bf is anything like me, he'll need time to ""recharge"" sometimes it'll be in the form of alone time, chilling and just being quiet, reading or playing a video game or watching a film. 

Sometimes it'll be hanging out with his mates, going to a casino with them or drinking until they can no longer form sentences or playing dungeons and dragons/ whatever it is they're into.

This doesn't mean he loves you any less, in fact he could be hopelessly infatuated with you, but he may not vocalise it or show it the same way you do.

What *may* help is you expressing your feelings to him in a calm and controlled manner, something like ""I feel as if you want to spend less time with me, but I want to be together more often than we are. Can we make a compromise?"" 

You could do a date night a couple of times a week or something so it's structured and you may feel he's being more attentive.

Sure it may make some uncomfortable. That is not the same as a real threat to your well-being. If you don't like creepers on the bus, don't take the bus. At some point people have to be responsible for their unreasonable reactions.

A need is compulsion and not based of loving emotions.  

Sit him down, and have a talk with him.  You need to be ok with him having his personal time.  As long as he isn't blowing off plans with you or disappearing for days at a time, it's ok to need space and distance.

&gt;wouldn't a hypothetical entity realize that over the centuries cultures all over the world have different gods but all converge into the same set of moral codes of morality

If the moral code is the standard by which we're judged, I have no reason to turn to a god. Secular morals are almost universally superior to religious morals, if only for the fact that *I'm not moral because of fear of punishment, or because I expect a reward*.

&gt; kinda assuming that a generic ""God"" won't be a dick

If that's the case, such a deity would not judge me for going where the evidence leads me.

&gt;wouldn't it be logical for an atheist to be a very ""liberal"" believer in something just in case

No, it wouldn't. You fail to address the argument at all.

&gt;The wager still makes sense game theory wise.

Only if you assume the options are binary, which they're emphatically not.

&gt;By this logic how do we know that a benevolent God punishes faith?

A benevolent deity wouldn't feel the need to punish inferior creatures at all. Just as a benevolent human doesn't feel the need to punish the ants in his or her ant farm.

&gt;I personally believe one doesn't have to spend a cent or be a hardcore fundie to get to heaven.

###Out of 28 songs;

##16 Absolutely Indisputably Ex-Boyfriend Complainy Songs.

##7 Songs Definitively About Boyfriends.

##4 Songs Not About Boyfriends.

##1 Cover That Should Probably Not Be Counted.

Well, I'm not really a Taylor Swift listener, so I google ""Taylor Swift"". A video suggestion comes up. 'Taylor Swift - 22'. Within the first few sentences she mentions making fun of ex-boyfriends. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgFeZr5ptV8

The highest suggestion is a video called 'You Belong With Me'. It appears to be entirely about how a guy with a girlfriend should be hers instead. Not quite spot on, but I'd say it was close enough to fit the category.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgFeZr5ptV8

The next suggestion is 'Love Story', which seems like a Romeo-Juliet song. In the first minute she mentions them breaking up and her begging him not to go.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xg3vE8Ie_E

The next suggestion is Fifteen. It seems like a pretty literal narration of being fifteen and going to high school. And wait, what's that? At one minute in she starts singing about believing people when they say they love you at that age. Transitions more and more into an ex-boyfriend song.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb-K2tXWK4w

The next suggestion is 'White Horse', which literally starts out with her on the phone with someone she'd apparently broken up with. An ex-boyfriend. Asking her to get back together. Incredible levels of ex-boyfriend song.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1Xr-JFLxik

The next one starts with her thinking someone was going to ask her on a date, and she spends the song singing about him and the girl he goes out with. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKCek6_dB0M

OK, next song's 'Our Song': Seems we found a nice song about her and what seems to be a current boyfriend. That's nice. I guess it's up to people if they want to classify that as an ex-boyfriend song, though, since these seem to pretty clearly be about her life, and that guy is probably an ex by now.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb2stN7kH28

Let's move on to 'Mean', which seems like it's not about boyfriends at all! We got one!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYa1eI1hpDE

Next suggestion is 'Picture To Burn', which starts out with her literally stalking an ex boyfriend with a friend of hers. Textbook ex boyfriend song.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCMqcFAigRg

Next one up in the suggestions is 'Change'. Seems like a nice motivational song of some sort, no apparent mention of ex boyfriends from skipping through it. That's 2 out of 9.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1jYllE0T-k

The next one ('I'm Only Me When I'm With You') I would have serious issues with anyone trying to pin as anything but a boyfriend song without the video there. And I'm not really sure if that video seems like it had much forethought in connection with the song. So, boyfriend/best friend song?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlTfYj7q5gQ

Now we have 'Sparks Fly', which is obviously about a love interest or someone she's crushing over. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKar-tF__ac

Here's 'Red', which is obviously what we're talking about in this thread. The opening line is ""Loving him is like..."". She then goes on to sing about loosing him, missing him and forgetting about him. So, obvious ex boyfriend song...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zlot0i3Zykw

Next up is 'The Last Time', which is about heartbreak and love. Another ex boyfriend qualifier. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuijXg8wm28

Here comes 'Begin Again', which I could have guessed from the title that it was an ex boyfriend song. Didn't have to listen for many seconds to confirm it's an ex boyfriend song...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMPEd8m79Hw

Now we have 'Back To December', which is another obvious ex boyfriend song.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUwxKWT6m7U

I'm starting to have to scroll down pretty far to find songs from her in the suggestions that I haven't listened to yet, but here's 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together'. Do I even have to play this one? Well, for good measure I guess... And it's an ex boyfriend / on/off boyfriend song.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA4iX5D9Z64

The next song is 'Everything Has Changed', which is an ex boyfriend song that's personified with visuals of two elementary school kids.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oM3kQpXRo

Next there's 'Mine', which pretty quickly hops in to setting up for an ex boyfriend song.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPBwXKgDTdE

At this point I'm having to go to her youtube channel to get relevant videos that I haven't seen already. Under the 'Most Popular' playlist without having to scroll right or anything I find 'I Knew You Were Trouble'. Which looks like an ex boyfriend song, which is building up pretty slowly but obviously. And, yep, ex boyfriend song.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNoKguSdy4Y

The next one I can find in the 'Most Popular' playlist is 'Safe &amp; Sound' from The Hunger Games. Which is at the very least a boyfriend song.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzhAS_GnJIc

Then there's 'The Story Of Us', which is another ex boyfriend song. Holy shit, if this girl is singing about different actual boyfriends in even half of these she's had more actual relationships than I have. And I'm like a love slut. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN6VR92V70M

Next one's 'Tim McGraw', which is an ex boyfriend song. I'm either getting really good at telling if it is from the first word said, or it's just that they're all fucking ex boyfriend songs. It's probably the second one.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkD20ajVxnY

Here's 'Fearless', which seems like a song about being on tour. Nice little break from all the boyfriend songs.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptSjNWnzpjg

This one's 'Ours', which is some sort of love song. This one actually seems pretty sweet, but it seems like in lieu of the song complaining about a love interest it has to complain about people who're judgmental. I guess the contrast is helping bring out how much her songs seem to subtly complain about the guys she sings about.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ34LlaIk88

Now we have 'The Best Day', which doesn't really seem like a boyfriend song. Could probably be misunderstood by someone to be, but hey, I'm going to swing the other way for this one and say that it's clear enough.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4_6eQm7RTQ

This one's 'Viva La Vida', which seems to be a cover of a Coldplay song. Not a boyfriend song, though. This is starting to stack up a little better, but I'm not sure if we should be counting covers?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcGbuveDwTg

At this point we seem to have dug through all the songs on Taylor Swift's youtube channel. The next one I could find was her singing 'All Too Well' at the Grammys. Which is going to be the last one I'm looking through. This one's definitively an ex boyfriend song.

You can't really blame people, though, can you? Honestly, at this point in time I'm having trouble seeing how you could write what you did while keeping a straight face. Obviously this girl has a massive collection of ex boyfriend songs, and a lot of them seem to be her (by far) most popular songs.

Bonus if I can get a really good book that can distract me from my sickness. Also, bonus! You have a really close supply of toilet paper for nose blowing, and toilet if'n you need to puke.

So, after my long relaxing bath, I watch Netflix. Something really good to once again, to distract me. I find mystery shows and comedies work the best. And combining the two is gold (I'm looking at you Psych).

There is a whole disaster prepper movement. One of the things they advocate is rotating through your hoard, excuse me, supplies, so that they get used and not wasted and then you rotate in new supplies to replace them. The problem with a hoard is the stuff gets piled up and falls apart, rots, or becomes worthless in other ways since it is not properly cared for or it's just so antiquated, like soviet soap, that it's useless.

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1390830871.0,"&gt; So, I'm hopefully qualified to be here. I pray you don't think me a prude...

I don't think you're a prude. You've shown clearly you have a valid fear of sex from a horrible experience. *Your reaction is normal.* In my book a ""prude"" is someone who is judgmental of others because they are different. And the prude is usually judging a kinkster out of ignorance. (Because I was ignorant once, and thought all BDSM was non-consensual.)

&gt; But there's a point where the male gaze (as imagined by soulless marketing and vocal internet trolls) can overpower a woman's agency. 

I respectfully don't agree that a person A's gaze overpower's  person B's agency (or choice). 

&gt; A person or group of people is said to have Agency if they have the capability to act independently. Unconscious people, inanimate objects, lack Agency.

Being unable to deal with being uncomfortable is not person A's problem, regardless of how creepy they are. Person A staring is a problem, but not to the point where it overpowers person B's choices. I'm interested if maybe you can explain this more. My general philosophy is that, non-touching creepiness does not control another person's choice. But, getting into another person's personal space is where I'd take action. 

Regarding video game characters: sex sells. That's just the way the industry is.

PirateCodingMonkey,gayyoungold,1390831065.0,"i'm sorry to hear that you are feeling confused and shitty about being attracted to older men. i'm pretty sure saying ""don't feel bad about it"" isn't really going to help, so i won't say that. i will however say that there is nothing wrong with those feelings, anymore than there is anything wrong with being attracted to men in general. it is part of who you are and part of the wonderful person that is you. it doesn't mean that you have to act out those fantasies with older men if you are uncomfortable doing it - you could just as easily role-play those fantasies with someone your own age. it may not give you the same satisfaction, but it might help you with your feelings of guilt and shame about it.

that said, you can't help who you are attracted to. if we could do that, there would be a lot fewer gays in the world because let's face it, it would be a hell of a lot easier to be straight. so you can't help who you find attractive, but you also don't need to feel shitty about those feelings. the reason you are confused and feeling guilty is because you have been socialized to believe that you should only be attracted to (1) women and (2) those your own age, and your feelings don't match that socialization. i am sure that won't help much either, but now at least you know why you feel shitty (if you didn't really understand before.)

my advice, not that you are looking for any, but i like to give out advice anyway, is to try to remember that you are young. what you feel now will change in the future. not to say that you won't always have a father/son desire, because you might. however, your tastes will change. you will figure out more about yourself. and you will learn that what you desire, as long as it is between consenting adults, is no one else's business or concern.

and until you are an adult - whatever that age is based on where you live - please, please, please, as an adult i am asking you to *not* involve other adults in your life in a sexual way. the guys who will do that are generally scumbags who don't deserve a wonderful person such as you."

emptyhands,short,1390831265.0,"With confidence, you have to fake it til you make it.  Sounds counter-intuitive, but *acting* like you are confident will change the way others around you perceive you, and thus treat you.  Keep acting confident, and sooner or later you'll notice that they all just assume you're confident, and then after that you'll notice that you actually are.  

Another thing to consider is that, although there are stereotypical traits that are found attractive in the dating world, no one person HAS all of those traits, and no one person requires, or even desires, all of those stereotypical ideals in a romantic partner.  For example, I am a woman.  I find a strong jawline and well-defined abs to be attractive in a man.  I can't even begin to describe how awesome my husband is, and he has neither of those things.  It's about the total package.

whiskey-monk,bestof,1390831306.0,"Just equality in general. Rape is immoral and forcing yourself on anyone is disgusting. Child custody should go to the most able bodied/sound/supportive parent/caretaker. People should do physical work as long as it doesn't cause harm. Hitting another human being is not only invading their space but something damaging both emotionally and physically. 

The list goes on and on. But it just floors me sometimes how people don't realize that we're all simply human beings. Yes, men and women are biologically different on several levels, but how much more similar would we be if society didn't impose these gender stereotypes? 

I have girl friends who act more masculine in secret when we hang out (who fart and belch and cuss and throw their usually feminine behavior out the window) and I've had ex boyfriends who will act more feminine once we're close enough (who cry when they have to, will write poetry or openly express themselves, who act way more sensitive in private, who goes into detail about their insecurities). It's those moments that I really appreciate them because they're being themselves. They're not being restrained by some social expectation to be macho or dainty or whatever. In public it's like a switch goes off and they put on a show. I see it in everyone I'm close to. Yes, they're happy either way, but it's more satisfying to see them be open with themselves. 

People are just people. That's it. Compartmentalizing behavior/expectations by gender is so disappointing. And the backlash for going against it is depressing. 

God. Don't get me started on the women at work who won't take out the trash or lift those 45 pound boxes. You could have had it done in the five minutes it takes you to call Anthony or Brian or whoever over. It's such a major flaw in our structure.

My favorite birthday memory? I think it was last year, my 22nd birthday. I had been dating my dude for about 2 months or so (we are still together and going strong). But he decided to surprise me for my birthday, and the only thing he would tell me was to wear socks. That's it. So he ends up driving me out about a half an hour away, to the newly opened Skyzone. (For those that don't have one of these, it is a giant indoor trampoline place.) I had mentioned to facebook about 3 months ago that I wanted to go, which showed me that he paid attention to what I said. 

So we get to Skyzone and have a blast. It was so much fun. and very tiring. Then we went back to his place where he cooked me dinner. We watched tv, cuddled, had tons of sex, a LOT of moscato wine (which is also my favorite), and then he ended the night with a beautiful diamond heart necklace.

So I think all and all, that was my favorite birthday. My dude paid attention to what I wanted to do, got me something he knew I would like, and gave me a lot of wine. And bonus, this birthday he also surprised me, this time taking me lazer tagging. I think he started a very good trend. :]"

It's like with US people commenting when a child killed himself with a not well secured gun. That the only fault is of the guy who didn't secure it. Well yes. But if the gun wasn't there in the first place there would be no risk at all of accidental killing.

AlexDeGruven,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1390831716.0,"Morning everyone. Busy but fun weekend was had.

Friday night had some friends over and threw the kids in the basement with a babysitter for a while. Had lots of fun, several drinks, and went to bed moderately buzzed, relaxed, and (most importantly) happy.

Saturday the in-laws took all 3 boys and we actually got to go out and see a movie that was NOT made specifically for kids (what?). Jack Ryan was great. A good reboot, and hopefully the start of a good series.

Sunday, #1 had his first ever wrestling tournament. He just started in November and has been enjoying it so far. He has apparently picked up and learned well, as he placed second in his weight class (5-6 year old 55lb) the very first try. Won 3 of 4 matches with a pin in the second period of his last match. I thought he was going to have trouble being such a novice in an open tournament in a tougher weight division (he's thick and solid and heavy, so he's always going to be fighting in the upper divisions), but he did amazingly well and kicked some serious butt.

But holy crap is an open tournament a LONG day. I got volunteered to work one of the scoring/timing tables so we had to be there ALL DAY, 7am to 4:30pm.

Now I'm sitting comfy in my basement because traffic alerts started going off at 5:30am and I didn't feel like dealing with that noise one bit.

Have a great day my favorite people!"

There's a huge difference between the guy who started an honest concrete business out of school and is worth $7 million at age 45, and the guy in the article. 

I don't think  we can get very far with this discussion, because most people simply don't see the hard working ""justly compensated"" CEO's of the world's industrial gearbox - the only see the most visible and most outrageously wealthy ones. Without being able to identify exactly who's being attacked and who's being defended, it's hard to carry on the discourse.

People need to realise that CEO =/= huge wealth, but also huge wealth =/= great ability. If anything, it's more luck and a dash of cheating to get to billionaire levels.

noc007,politics,1390831961.0,"It's still not a big problem. For transactions processed as credit, the card holder isn't liable for any fraudulent transactions. If the card was used during any time of the breach, the card issuing bank should have issued a new card and canceled the old card when the new one was activated. Card issuing banks know if the card was part of the breach based on the transaction data and should be scrutinizing for fraud more diligently until the card holder gets a new number. Card data gets stolen all the time. Large breaches like the Target one periodically happen. BIN attacks are common, but any processor worth their salt will have mechanisms to detect this.

One of the largest breaches that most people don't know about is the breach of Heartland Payment Systems in 2008. They're a Front End Processor so they connect directly with the four networks. They have to do a press release after the breach is discovered, however I don't know how prompt they need to be. Heartland waited until during Obama's inauguration in 2009 so most media outlets would be tripping over themselves about how historical the inauguration was and not how 100s of millions of credit cards had been stolen for months.

Using checks are not safe either and don't come with the protections that credit cards have. Hopefully your signature has some serious unique details and isn't just a couple of squiggly lines.If I get a copy of one check, all of the details needed for fraud are on there. Address, routing number of the bank, and account number. The magnetic ink used for ""security"" purposes can easily be ordered for one to make their own checks. It's not as common in the US since most places don't use it as a form of payment online."

Turksarama,australia,1390832160.0,"In theory you're correct, however capitalism doesn't work that way.  You _might_ be able to get a decent contribution out of everyone in a Socialist or Communist system, but they're extremely fragile systems which break quickly under corruption and Communism especially isn't feasible taking human nature into account.

Even if you did get it to work, what do you actually do with all that manpower?  We seem to have this idea that civilisation MUST be moving towards some nebulous goal as quickly as possible, but what?  Immortality? Space Colonisation? both goals require very _intelligent_ people to work on them, throwing millions of average people at the problem won't really help.  As it stands we're a service economy and most peoples job is really just helping other people out with basic tasks rather than actually producing anything.

I neither believe nor disbelieve. Just because you cannot comprehend this stance does not mean it does not exist. 

Also, I know that there is a spectrum of theist to atheist and I know this is a separate spectrum from gnostic (sure) and agnostic (unsure), however since I neither believe or disbelieve I am in the middle of the theist/atheist spectrum, while I am agnostic on the gnostic/agnostic spectrum

Geohump,atheism,1390832314.0,"TL;DR  By themselves, paradoxes have no intrinsic value and by themselves, prove nothing.


&gt;&gt;These kinds of paradoxes are not useful in the sense of dealing with practical every day life, just as the silly,""Can God make a rock so heavy he cannot lift it"" or ""When is red blue?"" paradoxes.

&gt;I disagree, I really don't think those two statements are equivalent at all. There are logically consistent theories about how eyes perceive what humans call the ""visual spectrum"" of light. We can understand the practical nature of why &amp; how we perceive ""red"" or ""blue"" as different colors. Does such an equally logical consistent theory of ""god"" exist? I personally haven't heard one..but I'll fully admit that ""personal experience"" is useless when discussing such matters.

The point of the ""When is red blue?"" was to show that we can make statements that appear to be logical and true, but this is simply a side effect of the way our language works. For example I can even say ""red is blue."" which is syntactically valid and therefore, as a statement all on its own, appears true and valid, but fails as soon as we attach enough external definitions and meanings to it. Similarly, the paradox ""Can God make a rock so heavy he cannot lift it?"" also fails (becomes nonsensical) when we attach external definitions to it.  To wit:  ( :-D ) 

How heavy is the heaviest Rock God, can make?  Its infinitely heavy.  

OK, so say God creates this Rock. What happens? 

Well for any object to be infinitely heavy, it will also be infinitely large, therefore, it occupies the entire Universe, and more, since the Universe is finite and this rock is infinite. (we will deal with the matter of collapsing matter below. :-)  ) 

(will the meta-verse police give God a ticket for exceeding the Universe limit? ) 

At this point we already see that the paradox is not real, eg it makes no sense in reality, just as the statement ""red is blue"" makes no sense in reality

OK, to accommodate this thought experiment we will imbue our thought Universe with infinite space.

Moving on, we have the problem of the ""moving violation"".  Now that this rock occupies the entire, (and now infinite), Universe how can it be ""lifted"" anywhere? To lift means to move an object away from the center of gravity of the planet, (or other astronomical object), that it rests on.  This rock doesn't rest on anything. There is no room left in the Universe for anything else to exist. and everything that did exist in the Universe when this rock came into existence, was obliterated the instant the rock came into existence. I'm sure the explosions were quite spectacular, but since this rock is infinite in size and mass, the explosions were quickly absorbed. 

Since we cannot ""lift"" the rock, would you accept ""move"" as a substitute? 

I assume that you do.  Well OK then, lets see if God can move the Infinite Rock.  To move means to displace, ie shift in position.   Can the infinite Rock be shifted in position? Well, no, it can't. Not because God can't bring enough force to bear on the rock to move it, but because there **no place to move the rock to.**  The infinite rock already occupies all space in the Universe so there is no way to shift it. 

At this point we again see that the paradox is not real, eg it makes no sense in reality.

Well you might call that an artificial constraint, so as part of this mind experiment, I will accommodate you by imbuing this infinite universe holding the infinite rock with ""extra-infinite"" space.  (The Math folks are now going ""WTF???"" as they absolutely should), so now we have ""room"" to shift the infinitely large, infinitely heavy  rock. 

Can God displace or shift this infinite rock, now that he has room? Yes.  In fact its not even hard. This infinitely large and heavy rock, is floating in space and to move it requires very little force at all. In fact just one foot-pound of thrust, (Sorry metric folks), will accelerate the infinite rock to a (very slow) speed in the direction of the thrust vector. 

Remember, any force upon an object, no matter how small the force, accelerates the object. So while the Infinite Rock is moving incredibly slowly, it is moving and has been displaced.  There is nothing to hold it in any specific position in non-real, extra-infinite space. 

And this is nonsense. The universe is finite, and cannot hold an infinite object. The ""God-&gt;heavy rock"" paradox is not and cannot be real. It is meaningless. It is an artificial construct of words which while syntactically valid, and internally consistent, (internally true), has no valid meaning in reality. Its just a paradox.

Collapsing matter:  Clearly a rock of infinite size would be so heavy it would collapse into neutronium from its own gravity field.  And despite its collapse, it would still be so large, (remember, its infinite), it would still occupy the entire Universe. so now we have an infinitely large neutron star. Which would, of course, collapse into an infinite singularity. Interesting concept that, a single point in space that's also infinite.... 

I assume that we have done enough to show that despite the fact that we can create a paradoxical statement using the attributes any presumed thing, that the existence of a paradoxical statement does not necessarily prove, or disprove anything about that presumed thing.

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1390832334.0,"&gt;Guns aren't actually that easy to use.

Yeah, so let's allow to train to use them legally so that future or current criminals can learn how to shoot. Nice.

&gt;Within 10ft a knife is WAY more dangerous and you can stab somebody 10 times

You have to get close to that person. You have to have enough strength and good aim. You need to be lucky to stub in good place (a person usually will try to defend). Person in defence can actually take away that weapon from you and use it on you. If you stab someone once/twice it's usually less life threatening than with one shoot, as for example you may not have enough power to put knife deep enough to damage internal organs. A bullet will almost always get inside and even through the body. 

With guns, it's totally different. You spend few moments to learn how to use it. Make few practice sessions and you can kill a person with one shot, from somewhere far, that person not even realising someone wants to kill or injure him.

If guns are not deadliest weapon why aren't there wars with the sole use of guns. Jesus, mate.

Fuck sake, it's like talking with US gun advocating morons who are either complete idiots or are in gun industry and just want money from it.

&gt;I know that I can be trusted to own a gun

Even YOU CAN'T be always trusted. Have you ever had any mood swings? Have you been depressed? Do you do drugs or alcohol? Why so many fights come up after a person is drunk, not when he isn't? You seriously don't have any idea what you are advocating for.

Also to that point. Can you trust your friends? Your family? Your kids? Maybe your kid will find where you hide the key, get the gun to ""play like daddy"" and shoots himself by accident.

Discussion with people like you is just pointless. Tell me you're from US so that I'll know it's a lost cause for a serious discussion about guns. US needs to sort their issues themselves."

oh, he is being friendly alright. he is flirting with you and wants to have sex with you. you said you had the same thing happen with another gay friend, minus the caressing. in that case, it may have been that the other guy was just snuggling - and let's face it, when i snuggle with a hot guy, i always get hard. however, with him feeling your ass and thighs, yes, he was making a move on you.

should you let his bf know? that's a delicate question. if he keeps trying and the bf doesn't know what is going on, you should probably let him know. if you want to have sex with the guy (or have a three-way with the couple) that requires a discussion with both of them. if you have no interest in doing anything with the guy, you may want to start sleeping on the couch. unless of course, you like having a gay guy spoon you and feel you up. in which case, have fun. :)"

Actually that's the worst thing you can do to a dog. 

E: Why? you ask? Because to a dog it looks like shaming him for peeing. Not just on a rug, but peeing in general. Do it often enough and you'll find your dog afraid to pee even in parks, so it'll pur few drops in the corners of house, behind curtain, in a room when you can't see it and so on.

While in science (say, physics) you analyze friction between bodies (I really don't have the right technical vocabulary to describe it as English is not my native language; I'll do my best, though), how it will affect the forces acting on them and their speed and the like, we give a bit more thought to the interactions that surface will have with other surfaces. If need to reduce that friction, we'll analyze the surface and determine what is causing it (roughness parameters, anyone?) and then choose a fluid (lubricant) to place on that surface.

Basically, we solve problems based on the knowledge you developed. Say, a bolt made of so-and-so steel is receiving X tension (man, at this point I really wish I was writing in my native language, this terms I'm using must have killed at least 4 engineers that read this post so far), what are the interactions between the steel grains in that material, what kind of atomic structure is more suitable and how we can improve that material to fit our needs better."

No one needs to starve, but I do think a system of positive and negative reinforcement (note: negative reinforcement and punishment are different), along with a good education system that helps develop a sound work ethic, would be far more humane than simply enabling lazy people.

In short, if someone is unwilling (but able) to try his/her best to produce something of value for his or her community, whether it be goods, arts, or services, I don't think they should be entitled to the joys of friendship and camaraderie.

Hello friends, 23 (f) here. 

I have been identifying as queer for about 2 years now. Before that I was identifying as a lesbian (6 years). I would have sex with my girlfriends, but I always just felt like I was doing it for them. I loved making them happy, and loved being in relationships with them. After about two months of this, I would feel comfortable to start declining sex. Obviously, this didn't go over well, and it would usually end my relationship. 

Fast forward a little bit to when I stopped identifying as a lesbian. I met a man that I happened to fall in love with. It was all very Chasing Amy, and we ended up being together. We still are. When we first started dating, we would have sex just like when I was in my previous relationships. I still felt like I was doing it to make him happy. 

After about two months I started to decline sexual advances. Only, he didn't really take it too personally. I finally felt comfortable enough to tell him that I don't like sex very much. I also was able to tell him that I really don't much care for kissing, holding hands, and basically all physical displays of affection. So, he backed off. But I knew that he really loved having sex, and I felt bad. I felt like I was robbing him of something he needed. 

So I have sex with him at least once every two weeks. It's so strange because I don't absolutely hate it, but I really don't care for it. I don't desire it, and I don't really get anything out of it other than knowing that my boyfriend is happy. Same feeling I got with the women I was with before. 

Fast forward a little more. I met a girl that I really adore. We have started dating and we have kissed once. She really wants to get sexual, but I just do not know what to do anymore. I feel like my lack of sexual desire is becoming too strong to ignore. I am tired of doing things I don't particularly care for just to make people who are supposed to genuinely like/love me sexually happy. We are poly, so I feel like they could always have another relationship with someone who can fulfill that aspect of their lives and we could still have our relationship(s) as well. 

I do fear that if they were with someone they were emotionally connected to and sexually connected to that they would feel they have the ""whole package"" so to speak, and leave me. I have read about asexuality quite a bit, and I even have an asexual friend. She is not aromantic and has a great relationship with a wonderful partner. I often finding myself asking her tons of questions when we hang out. She doesn't really know how to answer them, because as she says, she has always been repulsed by sex. 

So here I am. I have read about demisexuality, but I don't really think that fits with me either. I seem to be the opposite of that. I wouldn't quite say that I have zero sexual attraction to others, but I just don't like having sex. I feel like that doesn't even make sense. I also masturbate, and that is the only sexual thing I enjoy. 

I just feel confused and I don't know what to think. Sorry for the wall of text.

Edit: formatting issue."

We're talking about arranging D's next visit which is soon I hope!

Your post (though wonderful), I believe may give the wrong impression that they have been a continuous rule/unified empire since the 3rd century.

Particularly after the fall of the Han Dynasty and the three kingdoms era around the 3rd century AD (Edit: removed erroneous information). Correct me if any of this is wrong. I chose this primarily because people are probably familiar with it because of the TV show/videogames associated with it.

Anyway, my main point is: they were fractured a whole bunch of times after their initial unification. Chinese history is very interesting. Thanks to their diligent recording of history, we kind of have a somewhat full picture of it as well.

Bestbtrollin,funny,1390833250.0,"I am currently overweight, I am 250lb at 6'2, however I am down from 330 and I can tell you there's a huge social and psychological impacts from being that size that makes it difficult to not only lose weight, but to accept the fact that you are obese.

First of all, no one will directly tell you that you are obese, they'll pussyfoot around it, especially if you were fat as a kid like I was and tell you 'you'll grow in to it' it's just puppy fat etc. Also if your family has no concept of nutrition like mine did, and have all social gatherings based around food, it's very hard to be a part of it and stay thin. Also the bigger the culture, the more acceptable 'having a bit extra' becomes. The third and final step to being obese is deluding yourself in to think 'you're not that fat' and 'that guy is way fatter than me'. So to a lot of obese people, they obviously know they are fat, but not register the extent to which they are overweight, because it's too painful to admit that you did this to your self.

If you had have asked me to approximate my weight when I was 330, I would have told you I was about 260 and I would have, in my heart of hearts believed that. So only now am I the size I always thought I was. 

When one also gets to that size, one is also, in a sense chemically addicted to sugar and high carbohydrate food. I won't go in to detail, but essentially eating large quantities of sugar throws off your metabolic hormones, meaning that it becomes harder to mobilize fat from fat cells and the hormones responsible for telling your brain that there is fat available to use for energy become damaged. This means your body solely relies on glycogen (stored carbohydrates) for energy because it becomes unable to mobilize fat. This means when an obese person doesn't eat carbohydrates, their body literally thinks they are starving, so the hunger is very real.

I hope that gives you a bit of an insight in to why this happens. To the outside observer, I agree it looks like they are lazy fucks, but they are seriously damaged people who need help, not to be shamed. The same with any addict. When the body suffers, so does the mind, then the body in turn suffers more in a huge vicious cycle. Very rarely will someone 'decide' to be fat and just start eating ice cream from the tub and stuffing themselves with Mc Donalds. It's a slow and soul crushing progression."
silverionmox,europe,1390833258.0,"&gt; the Euro doesn't work

See, that's the rhetorical repetition I take issue with: the euro does work. It's functioning fine; the part that is failing is the current economic policy, which is failing mostly because it's constrained too much by specific national interests.

&gt; One can't build a union where no country gives a single shit about the law. 

Then we should give the union enough competences to set free-riders straight, instead of allowing rebates, exceptions and loopholes to determine the final outcome.

&gt;One need financial and politicial integration as well. And that includes shared debt, permanent transfers, shared economics, shared welfare etc. 

I'm all in favor for a basic social security minimum based on the buying power of the euro in the poorest euro countries. That way we ensure that the costs remain light for net paying regions while avoiding market distortion in the net receiving regions.

The most popular use of the gesture simply means ""up yours"", supposedly it's a big fisting gesture of some sort.. my guess is this is probably what it means when you see pictures of french footballers doing it.

The less common use that the zionists get stuck up about is from a french nationalist party magazine front page in 2009. Seeing as nationalist circles in france generally *weren't in favour of* the german invasion back in the day, and it's actually inverted, it seems pretty safe to me it's protesting the nazis, not saluting them.

The called it a symbol of emancipation like they say, and also a symbol of peace, which they left out in this article. Remember which NATO country didn't join the Iraq war, which country's right didn't cheer it on and call it patriotic? Yep, France. (okay switzerland too).

that said, good for you on working to improve yourself. hit the gym. see if you can get a few sessions with a personal trainer and then follow their advice. the more active you are, and the better you eat, the more your skin problems will go away. a lot of skin problems have to do with nutrition and exercise. as for the stretch marks, start using a good body lotion - make sure it is one that is not oily, because that will simply clog your pores and cause more skin problems. the stretch marks will fade over time, especially as you exercise.

I wasn't alive in the 50's and 60s, but from everything I've read and hear it seemed like that was probably the hayday of modern-ish wealth equality. There were still those who got really rich, but the middle class was thriving and the working class had steady jobs. There was something for everyone's aspirations. Unless I'm grossly romanticising the period!

I don't see an easy future as more and more jobs become automated. Even emerging economies are seeing the effects of that. Perhaps everyone could go back into agriculture or something? Or there could be a base level welfare for everyone. Who knows o_o."

*You don't really want sex, but it's okay, you guess

*You feel like everyone you romantically want to be with expects sex

But what I didn't read is that you have talked with your partners about what they want, what you want, and how to negotiate between the two points. That's pretty important, perhaps the most important thing here--assuming things about other people's needs is what's causing them to assume you're into sex; it's best to not try that guessing game back at them. You might be surprised by what they expect/need/want! And even if you're not, that opens the door to figuring out what you can do to preserve your relationship and/or pursue it further as appropriate.

(Also, masturbation seems to be a common practice among asexuals of all stripes, if we're to take this subreddit as even remotely representative. So don't feel too weird on that front.)"

elseedubya,relationships,1390833796.0,"I am no expert here, but maybe my experiences will give you some peace of mind, and that's worth writing all of this out at the least.  Tl;dr: you're a great daughter, you did everything right, and your aunt isn't processing her grief in the most rational way: just understand that she's misguided here and pity/forgive her until she comes around.

First, you have my deepest sympathy.  My mother died of cancer when I was 11, and I feel like there's this unspoken bond among children who've lost a parent this way.  The grieving process never really fully ends, but coping gets easier over time if you take advantage of resources available to you.  Don't ever feel bad for grieving for him even years from now; it's how we keep loving them even when they're gone and even though we miss them desperately.  

Second, about your aunt: she's not being rational.  That's pretty normal when you're processing massive grief, but that doesn't mean there aren't some nasty consequences, like alienating your family.  Your father had particular wishes regarding how he would face his death.  You helped to see those wishes were satisfied, which is the duty of any loving daughter.  It sounds like you did a really great job.  That takes incredible strength and composure, especially for your age.  You had every right to make a huge emotional scene, tear your hair out and curse God or whatever - and you handled it the way you did because you knew *it was better for your father*.  What a great daughter you are to make that kind of decision! 

You also sound like you have been preparing yourself for this grief for a while now.  You've had a long time to wind up your relationship with your father and say your goodbyes.  Not so with your aunt.  Your aunt only sees things differently because her perspective is somehow helping her cope with this grief.  She doesn't know what to do with grief, but I bet anger and blame are emotions she's a little more comfortable with.  Maybe she's got some self-directed anger mixed in there too.  It's so much easier to process all of that when you're channeling it outward toward a specific target.  So she's chosen to lay blame with you.  For whatever reason, it makes sense to her, and that's how she's chosen to deal with these feelings.  It's not rational or fair to you, but hopefully knowing all of this will make it easier for you to forgive, or at least pity, her.  Whatever you do, don't believe what she's saying to you, though.  It's absolutely unfounded.  

You are grieving, and so is she.  Your process isn't hurting anybody, and hers is hurting you.  You can try to explain it to her, but these emotions don't really jive well with rational thinking.  After a death, some people feel comforted if they can explain it to themselves.  Your aunt has found an explanation that suits her, and if you attempt to correct it, she will have to find a new way to feel okay (with herself) about all of this.  If you think you can handle being blamed for something you are not and cannot be responsible for, and save reconciliation for a few years from now, it might just be easier that way.  Of course, you have every right to set her straight yourself, it just might take more effort than it's worth if it works at all.  

You know those ""phases of grief"" you hear about: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance?  Guess where your aunt is on this list.  Just wait until she gets a little closer to the last step or two, and she'll be more receptive to rebuilding relationships and actually processing the reality of her grief.  Until then, she will probably try to hold onto this blamey kind she's got right now.  Just my opinion.

I used to be extremely sad that I had practically no social life. I had friends, but I noticed that the way they bonded with each other was somehow totally different from how I bond with them. It infuriated me so much that I was trying so hard to fit in and to be a normal person and yet everything was proving fruitless. (I used to be a perfect A student in school and college, so I couldn't understand how I could fail at something simple like social interactions.) Once I learned the fact that some people are just not born that way and that it was perfectly normal to feel socially awkward, I stopped feeling sad about it.

This is something I wrote in a similar thread:

&gt;It's in your genes, in your bringing up, and those are things you can't change. [...] What you can do is to be a good person. (It looks like shitty advice, I know, but read on.) Do not try too hard to please others, do not fake confidence. Instead, try to be kind, try to be understanding, try to be as unselfish as possible without jeopardising your own priorities. You may or may not gain friends by doing this, but people will definitely start to like you more, and they will come to understand your difficulty with social situations. You will be trusted and respected. Once you get to that point, you will be in a better position to try to make friends."

chrunchy,canada,1390834013.0,"Bullshit, bullshit bullshit. It's like the American CEOs saying they'll shut down their companies before they let women get birth control on their company insurance. It's not going to happen.

Reason being, I can hire a worker for $10 or $12 or $14 an hour and it's going to be way more cost effective than installing a $250k robotic material handling system. 

Now, if you're talking about paying that worker $30 or $40 an hour it's different. 

Look at it this way:

|Hourly Wage|Burdened Wage|Annual Cost of Employee|
|:--:|::|::|
|$10|$12.25|$26,000|
| $14 | $17.25 | $36,400 |
|$30|$37.50|$78,000|
|$40|$50|$104,000|

If your machine costs $250K to buy, install and get up and running it means that it's going to take *10 years* to recoup the investment of replacing the $10 worker with a machine.

|Wage|Annual Cost of Employee|Return on Investment|
|:--:|::|::|
|$10|$26,000|9.6 Years|
|$14|$36,400|6.9 Years|
|$30|$78,000|3.2 Years|
|$40|$104,000|2.4 Years|

In the case of a $30 or $40 dollar worker there's a clear case for investment of robotics. Managers perk their ears when you start talking about a ROI of less than three years.

But even them, human capital offers something that robotics will practically never do: flexibility. The opportunity to change work patterns, new routines and skill upgrades are a very cheap investment. Tell a worker to do something different and they will. Tell them not to show up for a week and it costs you next to nothing.

Now machinery... there's the logistics of running it, powering it with electricity, compressed air, hydraulics, maintenance and repair - all of which a human would do on their own.

When you buy a piece of machinery most companies are going to turn that from a large up-front investment of capital into a monthly fee in the form of an equipment lease. But doing that would easily double the amount of your overall equipment expense. (So suddenly all of the ROI calculations have to be redone.)

But that machine is now costing you every second it's sitting on the floor, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Tick. Tock. You're going to be paying $5K every month regardless of whether you have product orders or not. If you have enough orders for three shifts during the week and a weekend shift or two then you're golden. But have to shut down for a week? It's all out of pocket.

Oh, and you better hire a maintenance staff and implement a preventative maintenance program. Because if a part breaks or becomes misaligned then you had better be prepared - because not only are you wasting that lease money but you're creating a backlog and pissing off your customers. If they start cancelling their orders then that's even more money you're wasting. You might even want to start investing money in stocking expensive replacement parts. You can't wait three weeks for a delivery from Germany.

In conclusion, worrying about being replaced by a robot over something like a $3-$4/hour minimum wage increase is a waste of time and energy. It's FUD and you should not buy into it.

The VA is a bureaucracy, intent on giving out as little as possible. The nice thing about calling up your Congressman or Senator when this happens is that our office can pressure the VA (or whatever org it is) into fulfilling their mission statement--in this case, making sure this vet has treatment.

superior22,summonerschool,1390834366.0,"A duo top on the enemy team means free farming their jungle, free pressure on mid and bot lane.

Your top lane should play it safe and spend most of his time under tower, he'll eventually gain level advantages over them. Your mid and bottom lane can play aggressive since their team doesn't have any jungle presence. If you feed your mid laner some kills - again, no counter gank for them - you can go for an 3v2 top and kill them if your top laner was smart enough not dying too often.

No enemy jungle also means 4 buffs for your team. Your mid laner and you don't have to argue who gets the blue buff. Give your mid laner your blue buff, walk up into enemy territory and get theirs. Every dragon should be for free since they don't have anyone who can tank it early. Once your mid- and bottom lane are ahead, the outer turrets are taken their duo top HAS to respond to the rest of your team or the game is lost for them.

As for your top laner... It's not your responsibility to win the lane for him. Even if it may sound a bit weird, you actually help your team more if you don't care too much about top at first. As a jungler it's your job to put effective pressure down and gain objectives. A 2v2 top lane isn't effective, a 2v1 mid or 3v2 bottom is, especially since you can get free dragons afterwards. No one expects your top to win a 1v2. It is however his responsibility to play smart, not engaging in stupid fights even if it means to pass up on some cs, staying under turret. He'll eventually gain a level advantage over them, and once your mid lane is ahead you can gank top together for a 3v2. Your top lane should also aim for some early defensive items so their duo can't tower dive him, and him being able to get some farm."

You want something small enough that it can be constantly present whenever someone is using your apps, so a single line works out really well, but you also want something unique enough that you can pick it out without a question as to what it says.

For this you want to stylize it a bit. It screams baseball to me, and so I want to throw a fancy underline underneath it.

The F in Figure is important, and above all else this is what you want to customize. Your ""F"" is like the backwards lower case ""r"" in Toys 'r' Us. The rest of your logo can come and go. It leads to interesting company advertisement ""F.ind Music."" ""F.ortitude"" ""F.Access."" I don't know enough about your third project to do an advertising campaign for it.

Helt ogrundat påstående, finns ingen anledning att tro att vi skulle klara av att ersätta kött, slakt är inte onödigt. Slakt ärinte ett moraliskt problem - djur som ska slaktas lever *för att* de *ska* slaktas, det är helt irrationellt att se det som att vi tar slut på ett djurs liv som annars skulle ""fortsätta med sitt liv""

&gt;Vad gäller diskriminering använder du först en uppenbart negativ mening

jag använde den enda meningen av diskriminering som finns; att särskilja mellan grupper (i detta fall kön). Att det är negativt att diskriminera mellan kön är något som vi bestämt i sverige, till skillnad från de länder som vi (enligt artikeln) ska visa oss ""välkomnande"" mot.

&gt; Isåfall diskriminerar vi redan när vi har skilda omklädningsrum för pojkar och flickor

jag det gör vi. men som jag sa flera gånger - det är stor skillnad mellan att fasa ut existerande negativa mönster jämfört med att föra in nya negativa mönster.

&gt;Halalslakt är också något som redan existerar.

försöker du säga här att det är jämförbart att fasa ut skilda omklädningsrum och att inte halalslakta skolmat i sverige? för då är ju originalargumentet onödigt eftersom skolmaten redan hade varit halalslaktad. Men det är den ju inte och de två sakerna är inte jämförbara. 

Sluta föra idiotargument om du vill att jag ska svara på din nästa post.

&gt;Jo, vi kan ha religiös inställning i åtanke när vi formar samhället. Det har vi redan i nästan alla delar. Vår lagbok är baserad på religiös moral. Vi har bara normaliserat den så vi slipper kalla den religiös.

så du säger att vi har frikopplat lagen från religion till den grad då vi inte kallar den religiöst grundad längre, men av någon anledning är lagen religiös i dina ögon. Det är lite som att säga att européer egentligen är afrikaner, för vi kommer ju därifrån från grunden. Men å andra sidan om vi vill att ord fortsättningsvis ska ha innebörd och att vi inte ska göra idiotiska förlängningar som inte leder någonstans så kan vi ju bara sluta föra idiotargument (igen). Jag kommer inte svara på nästa post.

Anledningen till varför vi har ""normaliserat"" lagen på detta sätt är förövrigt *just därför att* vi inte vill ta religion i åtanke i juridiska ärenden

&gt;Men nu pratar vi om könssegregerad simundervisning. Du tar upp ett fiktivt argument. Det är ett minst lika rimligt påstående att det inte alls skadar någon att bada isär - lika lite som det skadar någon att byta om isär.

1. religiösa argument är alltid fiktiva

2. det handlar inte om vem som tar skada utan vem som har rätt att bestämma reglerna, och religiösa idéer har inte det.

&gt;Vad gäller rationell missar du att folk kan ha olika uppfattningar som alla är lika giltiga av vad som är rationellt

Fel. orkar inte utveckla längre för du kommer ändå inte svara med tillräcklig nivå (som du visat ovan) men lita på mig detta är fel."

And that is OK. No one should be able to force a woman to have an abortion or give up a child to adoption. That would be wrong and hopefully will forever be wrong. 

The thing is, if the woman chooses to, she does have those options available to her, as she should. The man, however, does not. A potential solution that has been proposed is the option of a legal document that has to be signed before the child's birth. This document would completely sever any ties the man has with the child. He would have no parental rights, no visitation rights, nothing. The catch is that it would also relieve him of any financial responsibilities towards the child and mother. 

If you have any issues with this please let me know. Providing valid criticism to an idea is the only way for it to become a great idea. "

Twelve cards are laid out, and you have to find three cards, where all of the four features exist only once per card OR on all three cards:

* number (one, two, or three)
* symbol (diamond, squiggle, oval)
* shading (solid, striped, or open)
* color (red, green, or purple)

So the set for the first two vowels (3 squiggle, open, purple) and (1 squiggle, striped, purple) would be the T (2 squiggle, solid, purple)

Brightt,relationship_advice,1390834963.0,"Alright, as someone who is still due on at least one birthday present for my SO (I've got something in mind, so she'll be getting one), and someone who's Christmas present routine is basically another family member telling me ""I bought a present for *person*, you're (co)paying for it"", let me give you an inside perspective of how his mind probably works.

I don't not give presents because I'm selfish or greedy (on the contrary, I'll give you the shirt of my back, and money is the least of my concerns), or because I don't care about you (I love my SO dearly and couldn't be happier with her). It's because it just doesn't dawn on me. I don't care about presents myself, because I'm not materialistic at all. If no one gave me a present for Christmas or my birthday, I wouldn't really care. I would certainly deserve it, that's for damn sure.

I dunno, I seriously just don't think about it. Other years, when my SO was around for Christmas, she had to basically remind me to buy/look for presents at least 5 times a week for 2 months beforehand before I would remember actually doing it, and even then, I only went out and bought 1 gift for my family. All the other ones I either bought when she dragged me off to town to look for gifts, or were gifts she found and I was paying part of.

It's just not an important thing for me, and it doesn't cross my mind. I think the most gifts I've owed my SO at some point in time was 3 birthdays. I've only been with her for 4 birthdays of hers. It's not like I don't appreciate her or take her for granted, I just don't think about it. Well, that and her birthday always falls during a camp that I've been attending for the past 16 years, so kind of hard to find a present during that time. And after her birthday has passed, I usually forget I owe her a present and she'll remind me every now and then, and then I'll forget about it 10 minutes later.

It's not behavior that's easy to change, and my family has learned to live with it, and so has my SO. They just hope to gradually change me over the years.

Be patient, and give him the option to give presents later on. That's how I usually fix it. And be patient about it, it's not something you'll easily change probably. Another problem that doesn't help this behavior for me is that I don't value birthdays. I spent one of my recent birthdays alone in my dorm, I forgot my own birthday at some point in my life, and was reminded of it the day after, etc. I just honestly don't care about them.

Please note that I do give her small gifts all the time. Notes I hide in her books, doing the dishes in her dorm she's been putting off for days, because she doesn't have much time. Cleaning her room. Lots of small thoughtful things. I just suck at giving gifts."

Takuya-san,australia,1390835112.0,"You're still using the same moronic argument. People have paid for things in the past that they've received little benefit from and you've likely received benefits from.

I'll try and put it simply for you. If nobody cooperated and worked together by investing in the future, we'd all be banging rocks together in caves still. A sense of legacy is part of how the human race works. You've benefited from the legacy of the human race, and now it's our turn to make sure things aren't horrible for future generations.

It doesn't matter if you do or don't care about this. That's why government and taxes exist - things like scientific research benefit the individual little but society a lot. There's little incentive for individuals (or indeed corporations, except for short-term benefit research) to work towards a better collective future, so by giving up small amounts of money in taxes (yes, it adds up to a lot, but each individual public service costs very little) society becomes better.

If you don't care for giving up a small amount of money for the betterment of society (and security for yourself), then you should fuck off to some backwards-ass country where they pay low taxes. Good luck if you ever have a medical issue. Good luck if you're attacked or something. Good luck if you ever decide to have children.

As a side note, if you can't form these basic logical conclusions, I suggest you read more books. You obviously haven't developed critical thinking skills in schools. You were given tons of free education and you threw it away playing video games or something."

In terms of attitudes, political outlook, and the way he actually interacts with women, he's extremely evolved, indeed more so than my male friends who come from much more liberal backgrounds. He just has all this ""traditional"" manners stuff that he does because he was raised that way, which makes him come off as some kind of vaguely sexist historical relic until you get to know him. I've known a lot of old-school Southern guys who fall into that category, none of whom I would describe as sexists, but rather as great friends and mentors. My thesis advisor is an older British man who insists on pulling out a chair for me every time I come into his office, but he's never treated me with anything but great respect and he's done more for my academic and professional life than pretty much anyone.

You can be a sexist who also has ""traditional"" manners, but one doesn't guarantee the other. Believing women are inferior, purposely keeping them down, paying them less than men for the same work, and participating in efforts to deprive them of their basic rights--that makes you a sexist.

whiskey-monk,AskWomen,1390835349.0,"My ex from a couple years ago. I was 21. He was 25. Dumped him because I wasn't ready for a commitment (the type of serious relationship he was looking for, anyway). I bolted because I didn't see us breaking up for any other reason and the relationship itself seemed to be going strong. Like we could have gotten married at some point if it kept going. I wasn't ready for that and it terrified me. I was just lonely and looking for experience, not a life partner. I didn't understand how my sisters/mother got married at my age (or younger in the case of my then 19 year old sister) 

Now I might be moving a couple states over to be with someone else. We've cared for each other for the past two years (a few months after I dumped my ex) and it just sort of happened. I didn't want it to, but it did. My friends and I spoke about it and they said I act like a different person when I speak about him. To be completely honest (and I said this out loud to my friends as well) I can see us being together for a very long time. I don't think I'll come back to my home state if I move over there. We could even get married in a couple years. And I'm kind of relieved and accepting of that idea. 

It feels natural now. I'm ready for that and I know what I want for once in my life. I spend every moment thinking of him. Hearing from him--even if I'm in the worst mood--gives me some type of release. The thought of him in my bad moments gives me closure. He brings out these parts of me I didn't know existed. My favorite part of the day is flirting with him and trying to be charming so I can continue to woo him. It's like we have our own unique language and understand each other on this deeper level. He connects to me in a way no one else ever has. And he's accepting of every part of myself, even the bad ones (especially the bad ones). I cherish him. 

Would I prefer it to be my ex? No. Yes, we had a great time together. But I feel like he helped me develop into who I am today. I wouldn't be capable of this behavior if it weren't for him, I think. I wouldn't be ready for this big step. It's like he indirectly taught me how to appreciate a relationship like this. 

**edit**: I should clarify that because of our young age (we're on the cusp of turning 23 in the next 3-4 months) I'm afraid of losing him due to impending life changes. I'm still trying to get back into school. He's trying to get his career. Our families are slowly pulling us to where we may be anchored in our home states indefinitely. The thought of it not working out for those reasons makes me really upset. It's what terrifies me the most about moving over there, actually. Because our age limits our resources. "

PatHeist,funny,1390835394.0,"22 - From the beginning: ""It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters, and *make fun of our exes*."" Even if it isn't the point of the song, it is part of it, and it is something she sings about, in that song. Thus it lends credit to saying that that's something she sings about.

All Too Well - This isn't her song...

Everything Has Changed - Yeah, I guess I don't see your point where singing about a past relationship (with a boy - a.k.a. 'boyfriend') who they're no longer with, because it's a past relationship (thus an 'ex boyfriend') isn't an ex boyfriend song.

Begin Again - The same thing goes for this one. She's singing about her relationship with an ex. It's an ex boyfriend song.

Fifteen - Pretty large part of this song is singing about boys, and there's a lot of repetition about believing them when someone says they love you. Sure, it's not the central subject of the song, but again, it's there, and something she sings about.

The rest are apparently either tossed far enough in her albums that they're not on her youtube channel, or just not popular enough. And I did address that:

&gt;sure, I understand that by count there are probably more songs she makes that aren't about ex boyfriends than those that are, but it seems like all of her singles or big hits are those about ex boyfriends

*What led you to decide it was time for you to start?*
When I first met my husband I didn't know I had a lot of issues, they manifested in the way I reacted to his insecurities and enabled them to grow. Later I realized, after the fact, that I had lied to my husband out of fear for my own safety and not out of fear of losing him. When I thought about this more, during our separation, I felt like I needed help understanding why I was doing the things I was doing and why I so desperately clung to my husband when all he wanted was out. I was worried about reacting the wrong way and teaching my son bad habits or developing my insecurities in my son as well so I decided I better fix myself before I imprint any kind of messed up psychological twists on my son. So basically, journaling and going back and reading through my journal entries as well as deep thinking at night before bed helped me realize I need to get help. Losing my husband was also a big wake up call that got me to realize I needed more help than I was willing to admit to myself. Also because I come from a broken home where my parents were separated I was bound to recreate their relationship in my family so the kind of therapy I got helped me break out of those habits...which brings me to your next question.

*How the hell did you choose which therapy/therapist was for you?*  I needed to first identify what I need from this therapist. I had sexual anxiety, low self esteem, a myriad of deeply root childhood 'problems' that I inherited from the way my parents chose to parent us. I went to two different kind of therapists. I researched online decent questions that I would interview the therapist with on our first meeting. I asked in their belief system, by this I don't mean their religion, I mean this I mean the way they are motivated to diagnose you. Do they believe a persons actions are unconsciously motivated or not etc.  For me, because I wanted to change the way I thought about certain things I chose a cognitive therapist. Gender is important too because it will help you open up and get personal or get the right point of view. Look them up online too and see what people say about them, if they have written any articles and read them! You'll understand a lot about them if they have written things and if they have pictures of themselves. 
Interview the therapist..I usually couldn't get a hold of the therapist himself so I ended up asking their staff and if they didn't know an answer I made sure they got back to me with it. Ask where they went to school, have they been to therapy? Do they have personal experience in the matter that you're seeking help with? If you can get a hold of the therapist himself and he does allow phone interviews then notice how you feel when you are talking to him or her...that's important too. 

In the end, I stayed with one therapist where I visited him in his office for about three or four months and he helped me move beyond my insecurities with my father and beyond my personal dibilitating habits using certain exercies every week. The one that influenced me the most was having a random conversation with strangers and being able to say ""No."" Anyways, the second kind of therapist that really influenced my life was one I found online and even though he was a 'marriage coach' he was also a life coach and helped me develop better habits.  I would recommend him and his methods to anyone so if you're interested [here](http://www.marriagemax.com/) is a link to him.

*How long did it take and how much did it cost?* The therapy with the life coach cost a couple hundred because I bought his audio cd's and decided I wanted to talk to his associates over the phone to so I paid for those out of pocket. The cognitive therapist was covered under my insurance, the first six visits were free and after that I had a small co payment. A little research is all you need but if you need anymore help don't hesitate to send me a PM with your questions!

Good luck!"

Taking a look at Blue Buffalo's Basic line of cat food, the ingredients look good. There could be less potato, but there's no corn or any byproducts. The protein count, however, is awfully low. 30% protein in the guaranteed analysis. 

If you're pretty set on your cat losing weight, slowly transition to a food that is 35%+ protein. Pinnacle and EVO are two great examples. Supplementing with a wet food or feeding wet altogether will also help in the weight loss, as they are more digestable and provide more moisture for the cat to stay healthily hydrated.

rynchpln,islam,1390835596.0,"&gt;  What matters is that they were familiar with the concept -- that is to say, there is one God, and that The Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit are all God

The problem is that your definition of **them** knowing that all three of those characters are God is far too vague. You can't say well matters of Arian, Nesortorian (sp), or Jacobite Christology are necessary for being a believer or for being saved. This would discount 98% modern day lay Christians including those in your own denomination. (I'm sure you've heard the various analogies used. If you are well read you will be aware there is no functioning analogy which is not heretical by orthodox standards). Yet if you then admit you can be a believer and disagree about over these matters then you have to accept as valid that there were entire groups of Christianity whose only contact with those who were Orthodox was when being persecuted by them. 

&gt; They believe... perhaps even a Messiah.

This is universal. All Muslims believe Jesus was the Messiah. Oh all Muslims also believe in the Virgin Birth. 

The next part is a bit tricky so bear with me. There is the very traditional form of Islam which I have been representing so far. However, it's the 21st century, there are more modern forms of Islam. Some Islamic scholars in these schools of thought are willing to accept Jesus death and resurrection.

But let's go through it anyway. In the 47-picture slide show, of the women convicted of sexual contact with a minor, only eight actual sentences are mentioned: five of the eight women do prison time (7-10-year sentences), one got jail time and probation, and two pleaded out and got probation and deferred sentences. Sounds like a lot of them end up spending a significant amount of time behind bars.

sleepyj910,DebateAnAtheist,1390835893.0,"&gt; it seems hard to get this sort of thing without any sort of spiritual/religious belief.

Radiohead albums and drugs will do it in my experience.  We understand the neurology behind these experiences, and it doesn't require lying to people, or forcing them to accept unproven claims.  Eternal love as an orientation is a philosophy, not a supernatural claim.

It just seems to me that she's trying so desperately hard to justify faith, but atheists are spiritual people too, and until she can demonstrate that the cost of delusion outweighs the dangers of it, then I simply see her as someone who fails to see the wonder of the universe for what it is, or falsely attributes her wonder to the unknown and not realizing that the unknown does not require belief.

What's fundamentally true about religion is that humans are a communal species who will form cultures and traditions.  They have found Amazonian tribes that have no concept of 'Gods' or 'religion', and those people are some of the happiest around.

Religion benefits humanity despite it's supernatural nature, not because of it.  And the important point is that it's only supernatural because that's what was considered natural at the time.  But we have progressed as a species, and if we lost all our myths, but retained our scientific knowledge, we'd form new traditions without any of the old supernatural beliefs.

Of course, she claims there is some absolute power, but in the end that just makes her like the other apologists, making claims that have no basis.  

She has to demonstrate that the God hypothesis is necessary, but it's not needed to explain anything, and it's wishful thinking to assert that it's necessary for community or spirituality.

tangerinelion,worldnews,1390835970.0,"It gets trickier here because HSBC is a bank.  They, by definition, have the ability to create investments that cause their money to be worth more money.  Hypothetically, let's say cartels are able to launder $300B of money through HSBC and get to keep 80%.  So HSBC stuffs $60B into their own accounts, and let's say the drug market is stable rather than expanding so that's $6B/yr for 10 years.  Let's also say that HSBC, as a bank, is capable of producing investments that net them 10% interest.  Doing that for ten years makes their $6B/yr payments worth $105B at the end of the ten years.

As a justice department you need to ensure that banks have absolutely no incentive to do this.  A fine of anything less than their actual profits means they can make money doing this and every dime they get is a dime they wouldn't have had.  So you need to have realistic estimates of what incomes they had and what capability they had to earn money on that money.  In this example, the fine should be $105B plus penalties plus executive jail time plus corporate probation.  Penalties are for breaking the law, the amount of the penalty would therefore come from whatever the law states.  (Personally I would favor penalties at the 50-100% level, so a total payment of $157 - $210B plus jail time).  Some kind of probationary period would allow the IRS, SEC, Fed Reserve, etc., to scrutinize all of their books for years to come.  Even the most minor of infractions would reap huge penalties and additional probation.  Multiple infractions should cause the bank to dissolve operations within that country.  (In the US this wouldn't be a huge problem like the banks tell you it would be.  Every account holder would receive a share of the bank's assets up to the amount in their account.  Any loss would be covered by FDIC and should be viewed as the cost of removing a parasite on society.  Anyone associated with that bank should be banned from the financial industry for life in that case.  Any loans the bank had outstanding get taken over by the feds and help fund the FDIC.  Clearly a bank may have receipts for X and mortgages outstanding for say, 0.6X then at most they have 0.4X liquid assets. The entire structure relied on mortgage payments received to exceed the cash withdrawn and this assumption is violated when a bank dissolves.)"

Driving a spouse to work is pretty normal, while the hitting/abuse is completely out of line.

The way you wrote that post made it sound like you were saying that people can ONLY be racist toward black people and that's not true. Just calm down. I agree with you that it just normalizes negativity, intolerance and hatred. I agree with you that that's a bad thing. But to say that you were excluded from threads like that *because you're black* is not accurate, nor is claiming that the only group that receives hatred is black. Hispanics, Asians, Arabic. A lot more people than just you deal with it on a daily basis too. If you want to be angry that's fine. But don't just be angry for yourself because there's a hell of a lot more than just that to be angry at.


How about trying to say that people who preach racism are *intolerant assholes* and you can't participate in those threads *because you're not a heartless bitch* instead of saying that you are exempt because of your race. You are trying to separate yourself from others who go through the same thing because you're black, and that's really not much better.

My planes' TWR are less than 1, so If my AoA is too high I don't get enough horizontal speed and as a result don't get enough lift to keep increasing my altitude, resulting in stalling and significant drop in altitude until my speed picks up sufficiently. I have to keep my AoA fairly low after the initial climb to ~10km. Patience is the name of the game, and it generally takes about 15 minutes to achieve orbit.

But she's going to get mileage out of that dress because we're having a wedding reception. If we were just going to city hall, she probably wouldn't even wear a dress because what's the damn point? Also, those costs are more for wedding *receptions*. You don't mail out invitations to accompany you to city hall. You mail out invites because there is a reception.

Edit: Those costs are wrong. DJ is more along the lines of 3k. Same for video and photography. My flower arrangements cost 1k in total. The father of the groom handles the tip. The jewelry quote is pretty accurate. A planner is unnecessary. Reception is probably a little more money then that, I'm spending 14k on my catering hall but everything is all included: cocktail hour, food, open bar, dessert and coffee, cake, etc. "

**Members only**

The Giant Mole's been besieging begonias since 2006, and it's high time she got an overhaul!

We've applied the full power of Malignius Mortifer's magic to bring her up to date with modern boss mechanics, two difficulty modes and a more accessible, instanced lair for solo or group runs.

Her drops include some grand new rewards: a clingy mole who can improve your anti-dragon shield, potions that'll speed up growth in your tree patches, and more.

There's no better or more rewarding way for mid-level combat fans to get into boss fighting. Read on for further details, or play now!

***Meet the Mole***

The Giant Mole's one of RuneScape's most venerable boss monsters. The result of an accident featuring a slightly suspicious plant-growth potion, the mole lives under Falador Park, terrorising gardener Wyson.

The first change you'll notice is an altogether more obvious entrance to the mole's lair. There's no longer any need to dig through molehills to enter, or to bring a light source - the mole's old light-extinguishing mechanics are gone.

***Entrance to the Mole's Lair***

The lair is now instanced, so when you click on the entrance you'll be prompted to choose how to do so:

* Start a new session: This allows you to create a new instance in which to fight the Giant Mole at normal difficulty. You can set the maximum number of people allowed, a minimum combat level allowed, and a numeric entry key to ensure privacy for you and your friends.


* Start a new session (hard mode): This creates a new instance where you can fight a more difficult version of the Giant Mole. You can also adjust the instance's entry settings, as described above.


* Join an existing fight: This allows you to join an existing instance in progress on your world. Simply enter the name of the player who created the instance, and - if necessary - the entry key.


* Rejoin my previous battle: This allows you to rejoin an ongoing instance which you left, be it voluntarily, through logging out or through dying. Note that an instance will collapse when the last player remaining in it leaves.


While there are no entry requirements, the normal mode fight is balanced for a solo player of around combat level 110. Hard mode is aimed at a solo player of combat level 140, or a group of three players at combat level 110.

 Battling the Mole
The mole's been updated to use the sort of attacks you'd see in higher-levelled boss fights. The fight progresses in difficulty over three phases, where she'll drop rocks from the ceiling, summon mole minions to aid her, burrow underground to attack from below, and burst into a damage-boosting rage. You'll need to be on your toes to prevail, ready to react to whatever the mole throws your way.

The fight's a fantastic way for mid-level players to get a taste of the high-end game. During normal mode, you'll see some handy tips at the top of the screen, which will help you counter the mole's attacks and survive the encounter. Then, once you've mastered the normal fight, gather some friends and tackle hard mode!

***Rewards***

The Giant Mole's possible drops include a new clingy mole: a cute critter who's oddly attracted to the surface of the anti-dragon shield.

Anti-Dragon Shield with Mole
With 45 Crafting, use him on the shield and he'll grip tightly onto its front, boosting its stats to those of a level 55 hybrid shield. The mole also gives the shield a chance to reduce up to 150 dragonfire or Giant Mole hits by 75%, but to deal that damage gradually as a damage-over-time effect.

After those 150 hits, the mole will drop off and skulk away, and the shield will revert to its original form and stats.

Also new are numbing roots. These handy consumables remove any damage-over-time effects that can be cleared by the Freedom ability - including the DoT from the shield!

Exclusive to hard mode are vials of ultra-growth potion. Yes, Malignius Mortifer's more snappily named prototype is yours to use - each dose will skip a healthy tree farming patch ahead by two stages of growth! Please note that this potion is untradeable.

As before, the mole will always drop mole skin, a mole claw and a mole nose which can be given to Wyson in exchange for valuable bird nests and - with an appropriately upgraded Falador shield - lily seeds. Falador gardeners will now exchange up to 50 lily seeds a day for 100 Farming XP each, if you've completed the Falador Elite Task Set.

We hope you enjoy the updated Giant Mole. As always, discuss this and give your feedback over on the forums!

Mod Deg and the RuneScape Team

How to fight the Giant Mole:

Enter the mole hole in Falador Park. Speak to Wyson if you're looking for advice.

Requirements:

* You must be a RuneScape member.
* Combat level 110 is recommended for normal mode.
* Combat level 140, or a group of three with level 110, is recommended for hard mode.


**In Other News**

* **We've made some improvements to the Falador Shield 4:**


* It now has the same damage-reduction ability that the anti-dragon shield (mole) does, with the added advantage that it doesn't degrade.


* When wielded, the shield gives +5% XP and respect in the Artisans' Workshop.


* The confirmation message previously displayed when using the shield's prayer restoration ability has been removed.
* It is no longer possible to use the shield to find the Giant Mole. There are visual cues to replace this function during the fight.
* We've added to the auras available on Solomon's Store:


* Added the Enrichment aura for the Divination skill, which comes in five tiers, giving up to a 15% additional chance to harvest enriched memories.


* Added tier 5 versions of the Call of the Sea, Lumberjack, Five-Finger Discount, Quarrymaster, Tracker and Greenfingers auras, each giving a 15% boost to their respective skill actions.


* Added two new tiers for the Jack of Trades aura. Tier 2 requires 15 skills within 3 hours, giving 1.5x the XP that the tier 1 aura does, and tier 3 requires 20 skills for 2x the XP given by tier 1.


* The Oddball aura has become a toggle, and its graphical effect has been made persistent.


* In light of your feedback, we have made some changes to the Recruit a Friend system:
* The free membership for recruiters has been reduced to 7 days, and the XP bonus for the recruiter has been reduced to 5% of the recruit's XP, or 10% in close proximity.
* Both recruiter and recruit get an additional +10% XP for 7 days, as per the earlier version of the system.
* These changes make the system more immediately useful, but less open to exploitation.

So, Israel targets a presumably advanced missile shipment from genocidal civil-war torn Syria with whom it is technically at war, to a terrorist organization, backed by Iran, that has repeatedly sought to kill innocent Israelis... and you... decide to make a yes, BANAL, comment about ""peace"" and Israelis not wanting it.  An idiot like you, who has either A) zero understanding of the middle east or B) wants to see Israel destroyed, would turn a blind eye while Hezbollah assembled every weapon imaginable and when it finally launched them against innocent Israelis, would complain about Israels response in defense of its people.  In the eyes of idiots and/or haters like you, we can never win.  Anything we do to defend ourselves will be in some way, just another machination of the ""little Satan"".  So yes, go fuck yourself."

tank_the_frank,unitedkingdom,1390836559.0,"Sky's job as an ISP is to provide an Internet service. They offer a filter as a secondary feature to help sell their service and prove they're just as/more conscientious than their competitors, for all the non-tech-savvy/""protect the children"" type people.

As far as I see it, you can pick one of the following to sum up their actions:

* They don't know what jQuery is.
* They do know what it is and blocked it anyhow.
* They do know what it is, but didn't test the rule to make sure they didn't block the official source of the library.

This isn't like it's blocking requests for ""jquery"" from random locally-hosted versions, that I could at least understand as an unintended side-effect. It's blocking them from the primary CDN for the most commonly used JavaScript library on the Internet.

They're incompetent in here somewhere, and should be held to account for it. Because if they show this little care in blocking things that everyone uses, they'll show similar regard for stuff only some people use, except there'll be much less outcry when it happens then.

If they're going to start filtering things, they should do it with the degree of responsibility and professionalism that it deserves.

(Also, not everyone can turn off the filter because they don't have access to the Sky account they use. Also, not tech-savvy? They'll say ""This website is shit!"" not ""Oh, Sky have accidentally blocked a key dependency for this website. I better notify them so they can remove it, then it will work properly."")"

Without a clear definition such terms cannot be meaningfully discussed. Such terms or concepts must also be falsifiable. Lacking this an ignostic takes the theological noncognitivist position that the existence or nature of the terms presented (and all matters of debate) is meaningless.

By Wikipedia's definition, I'd consider myself an ignostic, while by yours I would consider myself anything but. Do you have a source for your definition?

&gt;Ignostics believe that it is likely that one or more 'higher powers' than humans, or human consciousness, do actually exist.

Presbyopia is when your lens hasn't gotten too thick/rigid from age that your ciliary muscles can't generate enough force to change its shape enough to focus at objects at near. Myopia is because the axial length of your eye is too long for the refractive power of your cornea and lens.

Every person, and many animals, go through a process called emmetropization during the early years of life. Based on the blur the visual system senses, the axial length of the eye is changed - it could be shortened or lengthened. There are many studies that have looked into this, but here's [one](http://www.nature.com/eye/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/eye2013277a.html).

Additionally, there's ongoing research into a genetic link, as this [study is doing.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17653045)

[Here's](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12454029) another study that puts genetics and environment together.

chrunchy,canada,1390837202.0,"*Automation* has a huge meaning. There's automation that's going to happen regardless because of productivity and quality improvements. Imagine a worker who's only job is to drill a hole in a corner of plastic. Over and over all day long. There's already an air compressor system and a dedicated workstation there - so it's not a huge stretch to install a pneumatic plunger on a drill and outfit the workstation with a metal jig for holding the piece. It still takes a worker to align the parts but now productivity/efficiency and quality has been improved by automation. 

It didn't replace *this* worker's job but it means that they won't have to hire that other worker until next year. Then again, maybe the defects on this hole were causing a functional defect that was holding back orders. So maybe this additional worker is going to be needed to be hired sooner.

If you want to replace a worker *entirely* then that's a whole different animal. First off, that worker has to be dedicated to that work process. Instead of automating that single operation of drilling, now you have to implement a lot more automation. Bringing that part into the work area, aligning it properly and securely against the reference fences, triggering the drill process, ensuring the drill process completes properly, clearing the work area and ejecting the part properly and cleanly.

So here we are - we just wanted to automate the drilling of a hole and we're easily approaching the $5k mark in terms of process study, engineering time, materials, assembly and testing. And that's using in-house resources. If you have to go outside for this solution it's going to cost you double.

So no - I don't think that $250k is such a high number when we're talking about automation of a minimum wage material handler.

bluntbangs,TwoXChromosomes,1390837249.0,"As a child of a broken marriage, I have to say that without that experience of witnessing two people you love tear a family apart you will never understand just how scary it is to lay your heart on the line and say ""yes, I trust this person to make it work."" There's nothing you can do about that, and all you can do is wait until he finds that security. 

Second (and most importantly) you're 21. 21! That's very young to be making marriages nowadays, and unless all of your friends have been dating their partners since they were 18 too then they're all very young relationships too. 

I'm 28 and I love my partner to bits. I would stand by him if the world fell apart around us. But I'm going to enjoy dating him for at least 3 years as adults with careers and heartbreaks behind us before I consider getting engaged. 

So my advice is to cool down. A wedding is just saying that you're legally joined to this person until you die or divorce, and what will that change about your relationship? Focus on building your relationship now, and enjoy this time. "
clairebones,AskWomen,1390837251.0,"I don't believe that I particularly affect young men any more than other young men do. In fact I might actually say young men might affect each others lives slightly more through competition and such. I'm curious as to what makes you think women have a particularly pronounced effect on young men.

In general I think we all affect other people no matter what we do, and it's really important to be mindful of that when we act. I prefer not to do anything that can negatively affect someone else if I have another option.

**Edit to reflect the OP update:** That's both crazy and super vague at the same time. I think you put way too much stock in the idea that everything in men's lives in based on impressing women. Knowing the men in my own life that is very much the case. If one particular man feels he needs to base his entire life around impressing women then I feel that a) that is his own choice and not something that can be considered my fault, b) he needs to drastically reconsider the way he views women in general and as individuals, and c) most women are unlikely to be attracted to someone with that attitude anyway."

Your objections to words like ""T*RF"" and ""cis"" are based on rationalizations that are, at their very best, flimsy and transparent. I think the real hatred for that word is because it separates you from the rest of feminism, and that marginalization hurts you very deeply. 

I should note that I dislike that marginalization as well; I know a few people who are genuinely gender critical and not transphobic irl (surprise!), and they are prevented from even talking about it in feminist circles. This makes them feel marginalized, and they seek refuge in forums like this. It further radicalizes and alienates good people, and prevents a rather vital, imo, conversation from taking place in modern feminism.

Triplanetary,FanTheories,1390837437.0,"&gt;Firstly, the fact that its from the Bible means that any differences in the text would have huge historical ramifications for the Western world.

I don't buy that one verse in Ezekiel, which most people Christian or otherwise haven't read, is going to have profound cultural influences. Whether you believe in violent retribution against wrongdoers, or pacifism even in the face of evil, I assure you that you can find a handful of Bible verses to support your point of view.

The Bible is a huge and diverse book written by dozens of people from as many different cultures over the course of centuries. It's difficult to argue that tweaking one verse will cause a massive ideological shift in every Christian culture, because the fact of the matter is that you can't construct a singular, coherent ideological viewpoint from the Bible. That's not a disparagement of the Bible, just a comment on its nature."

justchristine,polyamory,1390837490.0,"After much discussion with my SO about how I felt about my BF, I ended up telling my BF that I love him. For the first time.  Which should be awesome, yay!

But... I did it in my sleep. I wrote an e-mail while I was not awake, in which I expressed that I love him. Knowing and expecting that he wasn't in the same place as me, but I needed to get it out so it would stop eating me up inside.

It's normal for me to write these kinds of things and then leave them in my e-mail drafts and not send them, but this time I hit send.

I guess in my sleep I can send all the e-mails I can't send when I'm awake.  

And then I woke up in the morning for work, and realized I actually sent that e-mail and it wasn't just a dream... and realize how awkward that is and panic a little.  Ok panic a lot.

We talked about it after he read the e-mail, and as I figured he's not where I'm at yet and didn't want me to be hurt by him not feeling the same way or saying it back to me (and I'm not hurt at all - actually glad that he wouldn't just say it back if he didn't feel it, because I think that would actually hurt if I knew) and he doesn't seem to be scared off by my feelings, so that's good.

Since I don't want him to feel pressured to feel the same way I do (because that would be silly) and I don't want to come across as pushy or clingy or needing of validation (because... that's not me)... basically where we're at right now is I've said my peace and I'm doing my best to not mention or bring it up again so as not to be awkward.

My SO has been really supportive of me and been there to listen and give hugs through all of it, which I can't show my appreciation for enough.

lifeisfractal,AskWomen,1390837532.0,"The OkCupid blog and my personal experiences online are both in line with your experiment. I think that if you have some sort of ""niche"" appeal, you're more likely to get tons of messages, as a lot of guys go online looking for the kind of girl that they don't normally meet in real life.

Quantity of messages doesn't always translate to quality, though. I get a decent number of OkCupid messages, but most of them are one word messages from guys who I have nothing in common with, or creepy messages from dudes who are looking to fulfill their black girl fetish. 

I've met enough interesting guys on the site that I haven't permanently deleted my profile yet...and I don't really have any other means of meeting guys that I'm interested in. My friends circle is predominantly gay, I live in a city with a really cliquey bar scene, and I work from home, so online dating is my best option at this point.

Epic thinks everything good has been taken from the franchise, Judgment was proof that continuing the game is hard and not as rewarding, so they don't want anything more to do with it, that's why they sell and are only interested in them using the Unreal Engine.

beefcakez,naturalbodybuilding,1390837777.0,"&gt;some people don't do cardio 

Those lucky bastards. . . . . well, cardiovascular health benefits you in more than just with fat loss anyway, so I personally think it should be incorporated at least 2-3x per week. I made a post regarding this a few weeks ago. I absolutely have to do cardio to lose fat (fasted LISS is my preference), maybe because I've destroyed my metabolism in the past dieting incorrectly and harshly, but I only do enough to help, never more than that. Something like 45 min in the morning and 20 minutes post-workout or something. 

&gt;How can I eat to lower body fat?

Like others have said, you must eat lower than your TDEE. I set a protein goal each day that never changes, regardless of the circumstance (training or non-training day). Depending on your style of dieting, decrease your main energy source (fat for keto, or carb intake for more traditional styles of dieting) enough to lose fat. Sorry, I can't give you concrete numbers as it will be completely dependent upon you. The /r/fitness FAQ and wiki has great info on this. 

&gt;I do eat pretty clean. But just can't understand the concept and how to do it.

Watch your choice of words, man! ;) But really, eating ""clean"" is something pretty harshly contested in bodybuilding circles. Hence, the IIFYM group. 

Anyway, just remember that your fat is an energy source (a pretty crappy one to access though), and for your body to begin using it, it needs a reason to. It's, in a sense, a controlled 'starvation'. Your body will recognize that you need extra energy to continue with brain, body, etc. functions so it will tap into your fat stores when it needs to. However, without providing a stimulus for the body to see your muscle as a non-energy source, you must continue to train hard and heavy, otherwise it could be seen as a ""non-essential"" and therefore be the #1 choice for stealing away compounds to make glycogen/glucose. Make sure your training is **HEAVY**. 

I won't bore you with biological cycles, but breaking down protein to glycogen is a far simpler cycle than fatty acid oxidation to ketones, etc. 

**tl;dr**- Eat below 'maintenance', meeting your macro nutrient goals for the day. Train with heavy weights while cutting. Accept that cardio may be necessary for you.

Personally, I'm not a fan of 4 banisher priests. Based on personal experience, the most trouble I've had against decks have been big Boros Devotion, and their kill card against you is Stormbreath. Banisher Priest is a dead card against that. Instead, I run 2 Banishers and 2 Celestial Flares (great against BBoV as well as Obzedat). I also have 2 plummets sideboard for Dragon, Demon and Angel. Also, atleast in my meta, there's  A LOT of MBD, so banisher priests at most is a tempo card against them. 

Depending on your meta, I'd run 2 of either Mist Cutter or Skylashers in the Sideboard against U/W Control and Mono Blue. 

**EDIT**

As for the new BnG cards, I'm really only excited for Brimaz and the Scrylands. The Brimaz would be an excellent replacement for my Loxodons.

I listened to Discovery &amp; Human After All exclusively for a solid month or two when I first got them; I was disappointed in RAM mainly because I felt like I couldn't do the same with it. It felt stilted, forced, and just less solid as an album; it felt more like a lot of collaborative voiceover work, with some interesting riffs cut down by (what I felt was) a misguided need for a ""commentary"".

Their music didn't drive their latest album; their commentary/message did. That works for a lot of bands, but in my mind, that's what's wrong with RAM. Take it as you will."

Every single one of the characters looks pasted onto the wrong background with no sense of perspective - look at the position of the helicopter behind Trask, it looks like he could sit on it and ride it about...imagine Stryker walking backwards, by the time he reaches those soldiers he'd still be triple their height.

I resent being forced to waste my time for her way too many times. If she was under 16, I wouldn't mind but she dragged her feet for WAY too long about being transportationally independent!

Since she would just *belabor the issue harder* if I told her that I didn't want to drive her anywhere, I figured out a more creative way to dissuade her from asking me for rides as often: *Drive more dangerously on purpose!* 

Because you see, I figured that if I make her fear for her life when I'm behind the wheel, **she would try harder to find rides from ANYONE else next time!** 

She had drawn me closer to the end of my rope plenty of times, so I had to do SOMETHING to get her to stop relying on me for so many things, when she was old enough to do more things on her own.

Higgs_Br0son,dogeducation,1390837909.0,"Hey, I'm no expert but I can try. 

The 20 doge you were tipped is now linked to your reddit account with the bot, giving you a balance of 20 on your profile. You can tip that to others (minimum tips of 5 doge) or withdraw it to your wallet that you access on your computer or phone. I usually have a couple hundred doges in my tipping account that I'm not too worried about, but they're not exactly ""safe,"" they're no more secure than logging into my reddit account. So withdraw anything you don't want to lose, you'll do this by PMing the tipbot that has your coins (I forget the exact terms to use, someone else will have to comment that). 

Similar to withdrawing, you can send doge to your tip account so that you may tip it to others. This will be done by getting a private address in a PM from your tipbot of choice. You'll send your coins to that address from your dogecoin-qt wallet, and it should show up within about 30 minutes to an hour.

*Basically* the bots just keep a hold of all the coins deposited to them, and keeps track of everyone's account balances. When you tip someone, the bot just changes your balance numbers to reflect that tip, without actually moving coins and subsequently clogging up the block chain with small transactions. When users withdraw, the bot sends you coins from his massive pot and that transaction is reflected on the block chain."

We got this size because 1ct was the smallest non-custom order for this particular setting.  If I had known how easy it would have been to do a smaller stone, I might have done 0.8ct, since my mom has 0.8 and it has always seemed like a good size to me.  Cost was not particularly a factor since I was buying moissanite with a budget that had been intended for a diamond.

In terms of satisfaction with ring size...I honestly never thought of 1ct as huge (I have always lived in major coastal cities) but rapidly became acutely aware that in my actual office division, I have the largest center stone of any woman, including senior staff.  It made me a little uncomfortable.  I think it's worth paying attention to what people around you are wearing and thinking about size in a relative way, at least as a consideration.

I have not experienced any ""shrinkage.""

My set cost $1400, or about a week's worth of income for us combined.  He had more budgeted, but I think I got exactly the ring I wanted, so I'm happy with the value that we got.  We wouldn't have hesitated to spend more if what we wanted wasn't available in that price range.

From what you said you're not financially dependent upon them so they hold nothing over you except for your perceived guilt because they share DNA with you.  If they are not going to respect you and your boundaries then you need to shut them down or this crap will continue until either they or you die.  

Asking, or demanding, respect is not an evil thing.  Don't let them guilt you into thinking it is.

Although the money would enter microsoft's hands from the hands of the devs/publishers, ultimately the consumer would pay for it, whether through many more microtransactions built into otherwise complete $60 games, or the lack of long overdue price decreases on new titles.

This will certainly be an interesting generation.

**EDIT**: I wonder what this brand cloud computing will mean for PC versions?  Will they not feature the cloud computing at all, and just do it client-side?  Will they use the xbox cloud computing services, but not require xbox live subscriptions?  Will they require xbox live subscriptions?"

I needed my piece and this human facsimile of silicone and metal was in the way. I shifted uncomfortably on my feet and debated jumping the counter that stood between us.

I turned to charge him, and maybe save my own skin, when the slug hit me. It was quickly followed by two more. I slumped face down on the floor.

chrunchy,canada,1390838429.0,"You're right, but that's a little bit immeasurable. If you make a process more efficient you might be able to delay hiring another worker but then you might have more orders because your quality went up. So maybe you now need to hire that worker sooner.

One thing that would help in this situation is to consider a shorter work week. Doing this would require more employees to be hired on - although some will have to be part timers at first. But then they get the training and if production increases you'll have a pre-trained worker available for hire.

In fact, this was the dream of the 1950's. Automation would lead to shared benefits, shorter work weeks and a higher standard of living for all. Unfortunately the increases in productivity benefitted the owners of the companies and they didn't raise wages proportionately with productivity. In fact, that's a bit of a hard sell. The owner took all the risk and put all the investment into new machinery so why should the worker earn more?

Here's an interesting thought experiment: in 1950 say the minimum wage was $1. That's about $9.50 today (Inflation calculator). (Ontario didn't have min wages until 1965 but give me a little leeway here.)

But what if productivity had increased about 225% since the 1950's? If your wage was tied to productivity that means that the minimum wage would be $22.50 an hour.

GetOffMyLawn_,cfs,1390838466.0,"I too find it easier to sleep during the day. It's called [Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder). I've had it since I was a kid. That doesn't mean it's impossible to sleep at night, just that it's harder for us. I also have an anxiety/depression disorder, so I know how it feels.

OK, lots you can do to bust out of the rut:

- Drugs. Antidepressants, tranquilizers and sleeping pills abound.

-- Antidepressants work on depression and anxiety. They also help with chronic pain so if you're experiencing pain from the CFS they can help. SNRIs or SSRIs are what are typically prescribed. They have fewer side effects and are prolly more effective. Tricyclics are an older class of AD but many are sedating, so they can double as sleeping pills. These pills aren't addictive but you can't cold turkey on them either. If you start taking them you have to stick with them or taper.

-- Tranquilizers, such as lorazepam, can help you get to sleep in the evening and can also be used for anxiety. But they can be very addictive.

-- Sleeping pills come in all kinds. Some tricyclic antidepressants are prescribed at lower doses for sleep, some tranquilizers are prescribed for sleep, and then there are things specifically designed for sleep, like ambien. I take a half dose of ambien, it works great for me. I have been taking it for years and don't experience any side effects at this time. (In the past I used to eat in the middle of the night. Made myself stop.) The problem with these is they can get you over the hump but you become dependent upon them. I've had lifelong insomnia so I figured I'd rather take a pill than continue to fight the insomnia forever. 

-- Pain relievers. If you have pain it will keep you from falling asleep. If you are already taking something for pain (SSRI/SNRI, Lyrica, GABA, etc...), or not, you can take an OTC pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen at bedtime. Whether or not you can take one with some sleep meds in it depends on what other drugs you already take.

-- Some folks here swear by MMJ. It's not an option for me where I live so I can't comment on its effectiveness.

-- If you want to learn more about drugs for sleep read ""Insomniac"" by Greene, there is one chapter on drugs.

- Behaviors for sleep: The biggest things you can do is 1) Get up at the same time every day no matter what. Set the alarm for whatever and get up when it goes off. 2) Do not nap. You want your body's desire for sleep to build up (sleep pressure). Napping relieves the pressure. I understand that you can't stay awake during the day. If you really have to nap keep it under an hour. Set a timer. Use a kitchen timer or an app or if you google ""60 minute timer"" you can use your browser to beep you in 60 minutes. They say you shouldn't nap more than 20 minutes but I find that too short.  3) No caffeine after lunchtime (noon). That includes tea, coffee, decaf, soda, energy drinks, etc...  If you want to learn more about good habits and coping behaviors for sleep read ""Sleep Right in Five Nights"" by Perl. Instead of lying awake at night you can read it. I found it very helpful.

- There are more things you can do for anxiety. Exercise (ha ha, like we can), but it works great. No doubt our inability to exercise and exercise hard leads to our anxiety. Meditate or do relaxation exercises daily. Read ""Full Catastrophe Living"" by Kabat-Zinn. Excellent book. Also, stay away from caffeine. Even chocolate has caffeine and too much of it can aggravate anxiety.

- Other things: Get f.lux for your computer, it dims your screen at night. Avoid TV, tablets (that don't have f.lux or equivalent), bright lights, etc... at night.

- Light therapy might help you reset your clock. Visit cet.org and take the quizes to see if it would help you.

- Sleep studies are discussed in the FAQ. 

Also, don't obsess if you don't sleep. Missing one night is usually not a big deal. You won't feel good but you won't collapse. If you can't sleep find something quiet to do, like read. Or lie there and rest and don't worry if you sleep or not. It's okay. Enjoy the darkness and the quiet and know that you will get some rest just from relaxing in bed."

It sounds like the biggest problem here is your low self-esteem and your failure to communicate what you want;

&gt;I'm really terrible with interacting with people. I never think guys are attracted to me, so I'm highly susceptible to flattery.

&gt;It is easier for me to take a sexual approach than to actually try to talk to a guy

then why do you expect him to want something else from you? you don't ""actually try to talk to a guy"", and you approach him sexually. Then you are confused that he doesn't want to have a deep conversation to get to know you better and that he mostly wants sex from you (which is the only thing you offered)

&gt; I went out to a bar with my peers and ending up taking home one of my classmates (not cute and the biggest mistake I could have made)

then why did you? only because he talked you into it? or because he said he would like more than a one night stand, while you didn't want that from him?

&gt;however, he said some pretty intense things to get me into bed, and mentioned he's liked to continue further, but nothing so far.

&gt;I feel like I'm just attracting guys who want to use me and then drop me.

You are. you approach them sexually and they respond to it. you do not communicate that you want something else

&gt;do I just have poor judgement in men?

if someone can just talk you into sleeping with him while you don't really want to, I would say yes. But mostly because you need to be able to tell a guy what you want or tell him 'no' if you don't want something/him. You need to get the confidence to go after what you want."

ihasapancake,Poetry,1390839157.0,"First of all, thanks for making some time to write up a response.

The reason why we set out to find +- 50 poems was that we wanted them to witness the diversity that exists in poetry. Furthermore we live in a trilingual country and the class is probably going to consist of French, Dutch and English speakers. Choosing only 5 poems makes it pretty hard to cater to the needs of a trilingual group of people. Maybe 50 is indeed a bit overkill, but we feel that we do need some kind of poetic arsenal up our sleeve. We weren't planning on giving them more than five minutes to pick something. I'm not really expecting them to read all the poems in class, but rather to just dive into the bundle and browse for a bit until something pops up. Most of the poems are pretty short, and some are visual poetry, so I was assuming that it wouldn't take very long for them to find something. But, like I said, maybe 50 is a bit too much. Maybe we should trim it down to 20 and get rid of some of the redudant examples of a certain style of poetry.

Regarding the 'pick something you don't like'-approach, we got that from a few well known poets in The Netherlands. Both of them had a similar experience, where a teacher would ask them to find a poem they didn't like, and used it to make them think about poetic criteria and what they do like about it. According to them, these experiences were major eye-openers to them, and for one of them it was pretty much the starting point of his interest in poetry. He picked an old poem, read it aloud thinking that it was too snobbish and antiquated, then suddenly heard the way all the sounds in the poem work together and he fell in love with poetry (or that's what he claims anyway). We just figured that it might be a big surprise to students to be told to look for something they don't like. I don't think any of them hate poetry per se. They're just unfamiliar with it. So being allowed to be critical and harsh could maybe spark their enthusiasm enough for us to pick it up and carry it along during the rest of the workshop. It wouldn't be much more than a warm-up excercise, in fact. Then right after the initial response of criticism, we could move on to the 'surprise' of the poem, though. That's a pretty cool suggestion.

You're probably right about maybe limiting ourselves to just one or two topics. It's not a weekly thing. We only have 1 hour, give or take. 

Thanks again!"

They're so expensive because it usually takes years of planning and expenses just to breed. Due to their breeding and the shape they've become, it is ridiculously rare for a female to just wind up pregnant when put with a male, they 99.9% of the time have to be artificially inseminated. Also, their shape 99.9% of the time doesn't allow for a natural birth, so c-sections are a must. 

Females, of any breed, shouldn't be bred until at least 2 years old to ensure the dog is fully developed and behavioral and medical issues can be more prominent to ensure you don't continue to breed those traits.

They typically have skin issues. And skin issues are a tremendous expense because they are very difficult to diagnose the exact cause and then manage. Many have heart issues. They have respiratory issues and can have soft palate issues. Their folds make them breeding grounds for yeast and moist dermatitis. 

They are typically not long lived dogs. I have never treated one over 7 years old.

Source - Vet tech

I think that if someone actually does their research, buys from a truly reputable breeder and not just any pet store, consults their vet, and makes plans to provide financially, then they can be great dogs. Very sweet and very good family pets.

Most people don't do the full extent of research, though."

NDaveT,DebateAnAtheist,1390839391.0,"&gt; The same point could apply to our moral knowledge. The very possibility of saying that the psychopath's moral intuitions are unreliable, for example, makes no sense without the assumption that the moral intuitions of normal moral agents aren't completely unreliable. It doesn't make sense to think that the psychopath could be right and something that everyone finds horribly immoral such as kicking puppies for fun could possible in fact be moral. The psychopath is simply missing what it means for something to be moral here.

This seems to be making the is-ought fallacy. People's ideas about morality are opinions, not truths. Sociopaths have different opinions about morality than most people, but that doesn't mean most people's ideas about morality are ""true"" any more than a sociopath's ideas about morality are ""true"".


&gt; Likewise, it doesn't make sense to think that, though **everyone** has the experience of a transcendent, ineffable, and perfectly simple reality, the correct religious truth might be a concrete pink unicorn or something of the sort.

Bolding mine. Everyone *doesn't* have the experience of a transcendent, ineffable, and perfectly simple reality. Even Armstrong only claims that a small subset of people have had that experience.

Amunium,MensRights,1390839498.0,"But are they really, even in a ""strict definitional sense""? I'm open to having my view changed, but I don't see it.

According to Oxford, *patriarchy* in this sense means ""a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it"", and *patriarchal* is ""relating to or denoting a system of society or government controlled by men"" - but neither is the case in any western country I know of.

Sure, in many countries men make up the *majority* of members of parliament, etc, but not only is this not even close to a system controlled by men, but women aren't excluded from it in any way, and actually make up the majority of voters.

At most, western nations are nations wherein men often hold the majority of power. That's a long stretch from any dictionary definition of patriarchy I can find."

The best way to know if it will gelp you is to keep a journal of memory/attn and other symptoms that you or others close to you are noticing. If the amantadine does not help over a period of several weeks, then the physician will likely wean it back off.

I think the little mini-spawned events help this, but not by a lot.  Basically every tech level turns into ""craft the armor and weapon, 2 shot every mob, grind ore, work toward spawning the boss"".

Of course, I wouldn't call this a bad game, for sure (I have like 160hrs...), but I would say that there's tons that could be added.

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1390839742.0,"I worked with special needs children, mostly autistic spectrum, in summer camp and after school settings for a couple of years. Most are not feeble-minded pinheads. You can teach them social niceties. A lot of people treat them like they have low intelligence, which isn't true for the high-functioning ones. So most of them get away with a lot of shit, particularly at home, by the time they're teenagers. If the caretakers and aides of an autistic individual are dead-set on doing nothing and letting their charge molest people, there's not exactly anything you *can* do.

I was always very permissive with ticks and the limits of whichever kid I was assigned to's patience for socialization. What I wasn't tolerant of was overt violations of other people's personal space. But if their parents and other caretakers don't back up that censure, one person isn't going to do fuck all.

Not going to the house at all is pretty much all OP can do -- if she's going to be the only one that doesn't let the kid walk all over people. If the kid has been running amok his entire life, nothing she says or does is going to get him to stop... unless she's *really* assertive and firm, and then I bet his family isn't going to appreciate the way she treats the kid.

Honestly, I don't like it when people treat autistic kids, especially the high-functioning ones, like fucking invalids and refuse to raise them and teach them the way they raise their ""normal"" children. It's doing a disservice to their kids and every person that has to deal with them."

Jealousy is a natural human response to this sort of situation, but you're the one who was dating non-exclusively, so it's up to you to put on your big boy boxers and either deal with that or start dating someone exclusively.

On the other hand - That whole situation was headed to Awkward Town on a bullet train and breaking the fuck out when you did was probably the best solution.

On the gripping hand - Nobody says you have to date anybody you don't want to, and if you don't want to date this girl anymore now based on what happened, that's fine, but you might need to take some time to do a little bit of an emotional inventory and decide whether you're really set up for this type of dating or if from now on you should make sure that anybody you go out with more than 2 or 3 times isn't going out with other people(and you of course can't either)."

As to your last point, why doesn't an advocate for children without two parents already exist?

And since this agreement would be signed before the baby is born, I wouldn't call it abandoning. That word has a negative connotation associated with it and to use it to describe this would be disingenuous. The father would be severing all ties with the mother and the fetus giving the mother full control and responsibility towards the fetus (something she basically already had). 

This gives the mother all of the information she needs basically up front. Instead of wondering if the father will be there later and supportive, she would know that it would be up to her. Sorry if I'm being a little terse, I'm on my phone. "

PatHeist,funny,1390839903.0,"I am, by no means, hating her or hating on her, or in hatred of her. I just find it absolutely ridiculous that anyone can even try to claim that she doesn't sing a fucking lot about ex boyfriends. Like, I had assumed it was bad, and I assumed it was probably really bad because of how much people talked about it, but it surprised me just how much all of her songs seem to be about ex boyfriends. It's like if James Cameron had 5 of his most popular movies be about going colonizing other planets with creatures already living there, 2 being about people going and visiting other planets with creatures already living there, one being about something else, and a not so popular movie being a remake of another movie. Sure, he might have some lesser known small budget films about other things, or some short films he makes here and there. But you bet your ass people would make fun of him for doing all of his movies about going and colonizing other planets. Because it's kind of stupid to do the same subject over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over (god, I'm getting tired of copy-pasting how many times Taylor Swift has done the same subject for a song) again. And it lends credit to the people making fun of an artist for doing so. Personally, I don't really mind. I get that that's sort of Taylor's thing now, and that that's what sells for her. But you can't honestly sit there and pretend like it's not happening. It doesn't make sense for you to pretend like it's not. 

And the 90%+ number, at the time I replied to you, was the actual ratio of songs (19 of 21) that were about boyfriends/ex boyfriends when I replied to you. I go through what, exactly, I did to arrive at that number in my comment that I linked to. And I've told you that you can dispute my methodology, or that you can argue which way I've counted those particular songs, but you can't just say that the number is wrong. It doesn't work like that."

NeverNix,TwoXChromosomes,1390839920.0,"Just to throw another perspective out there: I did something similar, although was a tiny bit safer about it. I was at a bar downtown by myself a few years ago on Halloween. I was a regular there so I felt really comfortable. It's not the kind of place where there's a big Halloween party crowd and it was like a Tuesday so it was pretty quiet. I was in some form of costume, a corset and top hat if I recall correctly. Anyway, this guy started talking to me. He was probably 15 years older than me. (I was 24? 25? ish) He was from out of town, visiting for work, something he did every couple of months. After a few beers he asked me to come back to his (very nice) hotel nearby. I declined, though I was definitely feeling interested. He asked if I would meet him here tomorrow and I agreed. We didn't exchange numbers or even last names.

The next day, I debate about going. I mean, it's some random guy who wanted me to go to his hotel room, right? But I didn't feel weirded out at all. And I had broken up with my fiancé a few months prior and was still sorting out what it meant to be single for the first time in my adult life. So the next evening I went back to the bar and sure enough he was there. We had a couple of beers and he asked me again to come back to his hotel. This time I said yes. 

I saw someone else I knew at the bar (again, I'm a regular there) and on my way to the bathroom I stopped by her table and said ""I'm going with this guy (name) to (hotel name) and he works for (big name company). If you don't get a text from me tomorrow morning, alert the authorities."" She asked if I was sober and for a couple more bits of info about him and then I left. You don't need the details, but we had a great time together. He came back into town every couple of months and we'd get together one night while he was around. After 8 or so months of this, he came back into town and we had beers but this time he told me he'd met someone and we couldn't hook up any more. And it was fine because we had been what we needed to be for each other. 

Intuition is often right. If your friends are worried, make a point for your next date with this guy to be in a public space. And maybe chat with him about the way you met, and make it clear that you're interested but there are boundaries to be respected, etc. "

Still, all of the top brass at Motorola was fired when Google took over, so those decisions are now pretty much Google-driven.  Also, Motorola has a baby device across all the carriers, and they're being absolutely tenacious about getting updates out.  I'm seriously impressed by them right now.

That said, I'd expect one or two more major version updates for the X at the absolute best, and maybe one major update for the G.  The G's too low-end to justify that level of support, and if the X gets two more major updates, it'll be upgrade time for most of the original US purchasers, so there's not much point in continuing."

It's interesting that you mention Gimli, because I remember people complaining about him being the comic relief, the butt of jokes etc, while he was supposed to be this proud warrior, and quite prone to reflection, too (he is mentioned to be moved beyond words by the elven forests). *And* he was enthralled by Galadriel's beauty and wisdom. The film really did flatten his character.

But then there's The Hobbit, where we do get a proud dwarf prone to reflection and another one impressed with an elven woman, and suddenly that's bad. I will not understand people.

I think it was almost impossible to connect to Thorin in the book (I find it odd when people say, ""I loved Thorin from the book!"" Why?), because he's unpleasant and mistrustful but also, because I think Thorin is a kind of decoy-antagonist. The protagonist is Bilbo, and they're on a journey, and there is nothing immediate they need to fight until they reach the dragon, so up to that point, Bilbo is fighting Thorin's mistrust. The movie kind of turned it on its head a bit - Thorin is fighting his own mistrust, and slowly losing. And I think that difference is mostly due to Richard's performance."
valkyrieone,RedPillWomen,1390840047.0,"I like to keep my workout routine somewhat the same, as in I do a certain amount of cardio and weight training each week but I add in other activities that I suppliment for some days.  I have been pole dancing/fitness classes for almost a year now and they are a great release from home and the ""normal"" workouts that I am used to.  It is also a great core and upper body workout.  It is also great for flexability and sexy! (Recreation only, I would never use these skills outside of my home, dance studio, or bedroom).

I am not interested in purchasing high end workout gear that I will only end up sweating in but I will mind how I look.  Comfort does not have to look ugly.  I don't put in a lot of effort into the things I wear at the gym but I try and still mind my shape and enjoy fun patterned workout bras.  

I can't believe the average is 5'4'' and 170 pounds.  That is just gross to me.  I am 5'7'' and I would have a really hard time even getting close to 170 (even if i tried!) and I would look like a hefer (at least feel like I would).  Luckily my gene's have blessed me with even weight distribution so 5-10 added pounds doesn't look like much on my body at all.  At 140 I look in shape and ""healthy skinny"", about 20/40% from those pictures.  

As far as diet goes, it really is a commitment.  I try and stick to low carb/high protien diet.  I like to eat all of my carbs in the beginning of the day and eat gradually smaller meals as the day goes on.  I Love fruits (apples, oranges, grapes, strawberries) and my favorite veggies are cucumbers, carrots, and potatoes.  Vices are sweets and salty things like salt and vinegar chips.  I avoid buying these things when I grocery shop to keep myself from eating them.  Everything with diet really comes down to eating things you love to eat that are bad for your diet in moderation.  It's okay to treat yourself and a burger wont ruin a weeks worth of hard workouts.

I don't mean they're unequal in general, just in the case of pregnancy. When a woman gets pregnant, she bears all of the physical burdens and half of the other ones (emotional, financial, etc). So the pregnancy affects her much more than it affects the man, and she alone risks severe physical injury if things go south. So it makes sense that she has the greater say in the future of the pregnancy. The man can try to persuade her to his decision, but he ultimately has no power once the pregnancy begins.

PirateCodingMonkey,gayyoungold,1390840089.0,"&gt; Maybe you do have some daddy issues.. so what? Who doesnt have issues?

i really think that telling someone who is attracted to an older person (male or female) that they have ""daddy issues"" or ""mommy issues"" is disingenuous. (and i am not saying that you saying this to the OP, just generalizing here.)

if someone has issues with their parent, why would you say that it manifests in who they are attracted to? if that were the case, what does that say about gay men in general? that we have issues relating to men? that if we had stronger male role-models, we wouldn't be gay?

and what about men who are attracted to younger men? or women? do they have ""son issues"" or ""daughter issues""? if they don't have children, are they trying to have surrogate children through the objects of their affection? and if so, what does that say about them?

attraction comes from many different factors, but to say that one's attraction is because of ""issues"" is to cheapen the love that many cross-generational relationships enjoy. even to call it a ""fetish"" cheapens such relationships, because a fetish is an object or behavior that is transformed into something sexual. a spanking fetish. a bondage fetish. i do believe that some people do ""fetishize"" other people - young men who fetishize older men, men who fetishize bears, older men who fetishize younger men, etc. but once you move past objectifying the other person and begin a relationship with them, it is not a fetish or an issue.

sorry if i offended anyone, it's just having someone tell me i have ""issues"" because of who i find attractive is insulting to both me and the person i am attracted to."

- Chaplain. The military chaplains are awesome. They listen well, they care about the wives and wives' mental health, and they have amazing resources. I got several books on communication and important relational issues from a Naval Chaplain. (My ex was USMC.) 

- Your local Vet Center. If your husband is a combat veteran, you are eligible to seek counseling services through your local vet center if you have one. 

- GiveAnHour. Non-profit organization of licensed professionals willing to donate an hour of their time every week to military families. I have used their services before and been incredibly happy. 

All these options are completely free to you. You are able to go during your husband's work hours if you're concerned about him finding out. I would look into GiveAnHour first, and see if MOS is still offering their library. They used to have a great cycling library of materials they would mail to you at no cost. 

I don't know how old he is, or what his history in the military has been, but it could be some weird military-centric mind-fuck and he needs a good slap upside the head. When my ex returned from Afghanistan, we lived together for about five months before I kicked him the fuck out of the house. He was an absolute horror to be around when readjusting. I struggled to find that balance between sweet, emotional, awesome fiance who I've been with for four years and OH SWEET JESUS, he's clearly possessed by a demon. 

What's happening to you right now is not normal and it's not okay, but I think you know that. I would start by seeking a counselor to talk about what's going on with him and perhaps approach communicating with him differently. 

If you do continue to do your husband's hair, I always did a 2 on the top. Shave the sides and then sweep upwards with the guard to create a fade (if that makes any sense). 

Last but not least, please be sure you have a support system outside of your marriage. If push comes to shove and your relationship isn't fixable (please know that no matter what you do, if his heart is hardened toward you and he continues to be a huge jerk, it isn't worth it), you'll need those friends and family.

Citizen80919,Entrepreneur,1390840212.0,"Great question!  The corporate soul sucking hell has taken me to a completely different approach to employees.  I have not lost an employee since we have been open.

1] Employees tell me when they want to work.  Some are working on degrees, some have other commitments. Once they get on the calendar, they are expected to work that shift, but they place themselves on the draft calendar.

2] I changed the shop hours so we can make it in one 10 hour shift.  Employees can work 4 10s if they want.  Most do.

3] We have a large break room with two refrigerators. I keep them full of food, healthy drinks, soda, and Colorado craft beers [they can have one in the last 15 minutes of their shift].  We have a family style lunch and talk about what is happening in the day, or just bs if nothing is up.  Brings the whole crew together for face to face each day.

4] I pay for work.  No sick time, no vacations, no nothing.  But I gave all employees a 20% raise to cover that. They like that, and it's easy as hell to manage.

5] I have employee of the month.  Everybody wins.  We go to dinner.  We do a group activity. We go to an employees house for a party.  We do the paint your picture classes.  Whatever.... I cover the bill.

6] I try to personally thank every single employee every day for what they do to help us be successful.

7] I share the successes of the company with the team.  After powering through several demanding things to success we took the crew on vacation they paid airfare for their spouse if they had one. The rest was covered....5 days in Cozumel.  1/2 the crew one week while the others ran the show, then switched.  We stayed the whole time.  It was less expensive than you think.

8] A multitude of other things.  Take care of your people and your people will take care of you.

How the heck does triangle head happen??? Should I thin the bottom out or just not do top layers at all?

- Triangle head can happen with a lack of layers. A side part also helps a ton to prevent it. As for thinning, I've heard not to use thinning shears on curly hair, REALLY messes it up. I have a big problem in the back with my hair being flat and not curly. What my stylist did was she cut shorter layers UNDERNEATH my top long layer. It worked really well! I'm not as conscious of the back of my head anymore!

Dry cut or wet cut? I've heard to do both :(

- Either, really. I recently got my hair cut the usual (wet cut for straight hair) way and my curl have a lot more shape, she did a really good job! (kind of funny, my stylist has curly hair, but chemically straightens it and I gave her inspiration to love her curls!)

Do I straighten it after or no? I've heard both it's rude because I'm assuming she wants to have straight hair, and I've heard it's a necessity to make sure the cut is even/not sloppy.

- ask the client! If you cut it dry, wash it, and then look at it again! Comb it out straight and if it looks wonky, fix it. It really depends on how your client wears her hair. I'd say, try to make sure it looks good both ways."

Old tea loses its flavor over time, so if it tastes really bland it's probably not fresh.

Cheap matcha is cooking-grade, tends to be yellowish or not as bright green as the high-quality grade meant for drinking straight. 

How old the leaves are and what part of the plant they come from are generally what separates a higher-grade tea from a lower-grade one, but it's up to you whether you like the flavor. Different types of tea have their own distinctions - I know there's a more complicated system for Darjeelings, but I don't usually drink Darjeeling so I don't know much about it.

What magic can't do is indirectly damage him. If you conjure a block of stone and throw it at him, he won't be hurt.

""What?  Why?""

""Well, we have the ledgers saying where the money came from, right? So we can return it.""

MaximilianKohler,anonymous123421,1390840667.0,"You seem to be purposely missing the point.

The man has no option to give the baby up for adoption. That's her baby and her choice.

Once there is an accidental pregnancy the man has zero choice and is subject to the will of the female.

The female however, has multiple choices, including the ability to determine whether or not the man will now be a father who will be stuck with the responsibility of having to raise a human being that he may or may not be mentally, physically, financially, willing or capable of doing so.

The man has zero choice in the matter. The image is remarking on the fact that becoming a ""dead beat dad"" is really the only option the man has, and he is slandered for it.

I actually had a very narrow-minded and disparaging perception of ""dead beat dads"" until this image. It reminded me that there are many nuances past the face value of the label. 

The fact that there are people still narrow-mindedly attacking the man for something he has no control over is very disconcerting and it makes me want to support places like /r/mensrights.

FrankieSucks,lastimages,1390840721.0,"At the IZOD IndyCar World Championship at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on 16 October 2011, Wheldon was involved in a 15-car accident during lap 11 of the race, in which Wheldon's car flew approximately 325 feet (99 m) into the catch fence with the cockpit area first into a pole lining the track before landing back on the ground.[14] The carnage and ensuing debris field resulted in race officials throwing a red flag almost instantly.[15][16][17] Wheldon was extricated from his car by the Holmatro Safety Team and their Las Vegas-based colleagues and was airlifted to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada for his critical injuries.[18] After interviewing the championship contenders, Randy Bernard, president of IndyCar, announced to the officials, drivers and fans that Wheldon had died from the accident after being pronounced dead on arrival.[19] He was 33 years old.[20][21]

Officials, after input from drivers and team owners, declared that the race would be abandoned, and that a five lap, three-car–wide formation salute would be held in Wheldon's honour, with his number 77 being displayed alone at the top of the scoring pylon.[17] He had been the only driver participating in Go Daddy's IndyCar Challenge where he and a randomly selected fan would have been eligible for US$2.5 million each if he had won the race starting from last place.[22][23]

An autopsy conducted on 17 October 2011 concluded that Wheldon died of blunt force trauma to the head.[24] Wheldon's head suffered two distinct impacts while his vehicle was airborne; the second impact, with the post of the catch fence, caused the fatal injury.[25]

Wheldon's funeral was held on 22 October 2011 in St. Petersburg, Florida. Fellow drivers Dario Franchitti, Scott Dixon and Tony Kanaan attended the funeral, and served as pallbearers along with Wheldon's brothers.[26] IndyCar held a public memorial service for Wheldon a day later at Conseco Fieldhouse (now known as Bankers Life Fieldhouse) in Indianapolis.[27]

Wheldon was the fifth Indianapolis 500 winner to die in a racing accident in the same year as winning the race, and the first multiple winner to do so. Preceding him were Gaston Chevrolet (1920), Joe Boyer (1924), Ray Keech (1929) and George Robson (1946).[28]

I actually cut out a part of my reply about how the entire decision is wholly sensitive to the rate cycle.  The rate cycle not only determines the starting mortgage interest rate as well as any HELOC rate; but also influences the inflation rate and to some extent the tax rate.  It's another factor that's unpredictable, but where you begin your 30 year mortgage relative to the cycle has a huge impact regarding this kind of decision."

r0dlilje,loseit,1390840832.0,"Well I'm not sure on the exact mechanics, but focusing on consuming more complex carbs is helpful in the energy breakdown over time. Personally I have had good luck with getting the majority of my carbs during the day from fruit, veggies and a little bit of whole grain pasta or rice. Not having any fuel at workout can leave you to fatigued and sore to keep up the motivation, but try to keep your pre workout meal well balanced. I like to have fruit because the fructose gives quickly accessible energy in the form of carbs, but it's not too much by any means and has an added dose of fiber.

Basically you want to give your body a bit of fuel to work on before getting into fat burning. Your body wants to hold onto its fat as much as possible, and working out on empty without such a key energy source could be counter productive. I think it'd be helpful to watch your refined grains and choose a healthier carb source than pasta before working out."

ClimbingWolfBear,AskReddit,1390840950.0,"I feel like I've seen the best and the worst of Scouting. My first troop, in Baton Rouge, was incredible. There were 80 Scouts who were all eager to learn, to camp, and to lead. It was truly Scout-led, and the adults would only step in if there was a safety issue, someone needed a signature, or if a Scout asked.

Boys will be boys, and shit like this will happen in every troop, but I'm glad I had an experience with a patrol and troop that was energetic, focused, efficient, and passionate about Scouting.

Let me run you through how a typical campout would work with this troop:

First, we would arrive at the campsite. The quartermaster and assistant quartermaster (both Scouts) would open up the trailer and start handing out dining flys and tents. Each patrol would secure their own part of the campsite, and the group area would be set up. The dining fly went up first, with 4 Scouts holding poles, and two pounding stakes. The table, patrol box, and action packer would all go under the fly, along with personal gear if conditions were bad.

Then, pairs of Scouts would go set up their tents. The oldest ones had it up within a couple minutes, and then helped the younger ones who didn't know what they were doing.

When the tents were set up, it was fire time. The fire master (charged with getting up early for the breakfast fire) made a fire circle, the water master took a few jugs to fill up, and the rest went out and gathered firewood, which got stored underneath the table in the dining fly.

After that, we started a fire, set out our camp chairs, and relaxed. 

Notice that there were no adults involved in this process. They set up their own campsite 50 yards away. Occasionally they would wander over to make sure everything was okay, but they stayed out of our way for the most part.

That is exactly how a good troop should run. In contrast, here is how the troop from my story ran a typical campout:

Everyone would pull up to the campsite. The adults started telling the Scouts to get out the group gear, set up the dining area, and gather firewood. When all that was done, some of us snuck off to set up our personal tents. The adults corralled us back together and told us to chop onions, carrots, celery, and whatever else for dinner while they started the fire. They told us when to put stuff in the fire, or in a dutch oven, or in a skillet. They told us when to take it out. It was the opposite experience from what I was used to, and I didn't like it.

This is getting to be a really long post, so let me make my point. There are good troops and bad troops, and I'm sorry that you had exposure to the bad. If that had been my first Scouting experience, I probably would have quit, too.

But don't give up on Scouting for your children. Despite the trouble I've gone through, I still think it is one of the most worthwhile things a boy (or girl, through a Venture Crew) can do as a child. When you (hopefully) look for a troop, attend a few meetings. Make sure they are truly Scout-led. An adult should be talking for maybe 5 minutes of the meeting unless they are teaching a skill.

On a campout, make sure the adult's camp is away from the Scouts. Do they trust the boys to run camp well? If so, then you are on the road to finding a good troop. And please look, because it is completely worth it."

I'm not sure how it happened. I have been dealing with back pain for a little over two years. My last job was taking care of elderly/paralyzed patients...sort of landed in it. I ran their house because they were unable too and i think picking them up, catering to their demands ended up putting me down. I did a lot of strenuous tasks i probably should have had help with. My back started going out after i quit and I could barely walk or do anything without extreme pain. It happened 4 different time before the big one hit and I was basically paralyzed. I dont think I have cried more in my life than the whole month of last august. It was probably the worse month of my life. I spent my birthday in a hospital wheel chair jacked up on morphine that barely put a dent in the pain. Spent the rest of it in the bed.

If you're tense, you don't trust your partner, or you don't trust your body,  it's not gonna happen. Now just be patient, don't ignore the hot zones you've hopefully learned about (neck, ears, inside of the thighs, clitoris,  etc) and just be cool. If you're tense, she will be too. And as she is learning what she likes, ask her if she likes different things.

Ouaouaron,politics,1390841255.0,"Let me see if I have this straight:

Joseph P. Kennedy became rich through many means, many of which [are seen by some to be somewhere between underhanded and illegal](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/716/what-is-the-true-source-of-the-kennedy-familys-wealth). One [alleged](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kennedy,_Sr.#Business_career) route he got money from was bootlegging alcohol, but that wasn't even the majority of his wealth.

Then he had a kid, Ted Kennedy. Ted Kennedy went into politics (likely with the help of family wealth). Unless things were different back then, Ted probably could have cut all ties with his father, accepted no money from him, and still been wealthy simply because his job pays well.

Then *he* has a kid, Patrick J. Kennedy. Patrick gets into office, likely with the help of family money and family name. 

But you think he should have just walked away from his family because he disagreed with his grandfather's morals? Do you want to know what political offices are supposed to be good for? Changing your country to make it better. What if he got into politics because he wanted to make the country a place where people couldn't be taken advantage of by people like his grandfather. I know it's pretty fucking sad, but if he didn't have his family and his wealth, he probably never could have been in office and never actually been able to improve the world at all. Freedom from being penalized by the actions of our forefathers was [an important part](http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/62/bill-of-attainder) of the Constitution.

You know what I think is *way* more important what his grandfather did? [Patrick himself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_J._Kennedy#Drug_and_alcohol_use) has admitted to drug abuse, including alcohol. If you want to call him a hypocrite, that is a much more significant fact than the relatively small amount of wealth his family has accrued due to alcohol, or the even smaller amount they accrued due to illegal alcohol.

This is the first I've even heard about Patrick Kennedy, but do you want to know my thoughts on him? He seems like someone who has spent his life seeing what drug abuse can do to a person. He knows that he doesn't have what it takes to not abuse them, so he believes that others won't have the strength either. He believes drugs are bad for society and wants to prevent as many people as possible from sharing his fate.

But go ahead and call him hypocritical because of what his grandfather did. I'm sure you've thoroughly investigated your own grandfathers and only accepted family money or help after making sure they didn't even have alleged ties to things you morally oppose."

The berms - my CFI told me a story about an ice story, an SEL that landed right after him and took out their nose gear.  They'd had an 8 knot x-wind from the left, to quote my CFI: 

""Because the wind was from the left he carried extra speed and landed on the left so he’d have room if the wind pushed him to the right.  Wind doesn't act equally on the side of a plane, the largest surface being the tail.  The plane weather-vaned (turned left) and he was into the berm before he could react.  The extra speed just sped up the process.
 
You only add speed if there are gusts, and then just ½ of the gust speed (the difference between the peak gust and the steady-state wind).  He should have landed as slow as possible with full flaps right on the center-line.""

I do have a question though...can P-Factor cause the planes nose wheel to slip on take off?  Do you roll on full power gradually?  I'd think to treat it as a softfield takeoff."

Delts28,FutureWhatIf,1390841276.0,"Going with the UK in a scenario where somehow everyone on the mainland are wiped out.

First, we have loads of Ambassadors, Military and several MP's abroad most of the time.  Secondly, Northern Ireland and all the islands around Britain would potentially be fine along with British Overseas Dependencies and other crown properties.  Essentially there are plenty of Brits still around that can install a real hierarchy in absentia.

As for repopulating the country, we'd call in either EU or NATO forces for help but with our troops in command.  Clean up and re-population would be the first course of action, I would go for Glasgow due to its proximity to NI although many would argue for London.  I believe the re-populate London crowd would probably prevail.  This would probably be done primarily by ex-pats and anyone from NI and the other above mentioned places that wanted to go there.  Knowing the current political climate, we'd still limit immigration to the UK.

With regards to the throne, the Line of Succession is well known and far reaching.  The heir would be easy to find and the military would install them to that position quite quickly.  The new Monarch would be a good stable figure for the fragmented country and despite republican nonsense the royals are generally good for the UK right now.

The big issues would be relatives claiming properties of the deceased, cousins and things wanting houses in the UK despite living abroad.  This would cause re-population a lot of issues.  The rest of the country going feral whilst their was initial clean up would also be a major problem, Scotland would probably take over a hundred years before being repopulated.

One strange thing is Stormont would end up being the national parliament and Belfast the capital due to being the only two to survive.  The British Army would deploy from Europe though due to fear of causing further civil unrest there."

i am more attracted to younger men. pretty much every guy i've seriously dated has been at least 3 years younger. the average has probably been about 7-10 years younger than me. i dated one guy who was 18 years younger (he was 17, i was 35).

that said, i have gotten comments from friends about ""robbing the cradle"" and one who jokingly said, in front of several of my other friends, that i had been to the hospital to ""see my new bf being born."" it was all good natured, so i didn't take offense. of course most of my friends are near my age, so as you say, they are mature and open minded."

yourdungeonmaster,rpg,1390841639.0,"I was in 6th grade in 1979 when a 5th-grade friend of mine two doors down introduced me to the game.  All he had was a set of polyhedral dice (no d10, and the d20 was white, marked 0-9 twice), the original AD&amp;D Monster Manual, and no patience to actually read what the stat blocks meant.  The end result was a fun game that had no relation at all to the actual rules of D&amp;D.  We were blissfully unaware of this fact.

He ran me through a bunch of dungeons he made, and I marched my 40+ member parties through them, the object being to come out the other side with at least one surviving member and a bunch of loot.  A typical room might contain something like 50 orcs and 7 demogorgons.  Yes, you read that correctly.  It didn't make any sense, but we had a blast.

Eventually he wanted me to run a game, so he loaned me the Monster Manual.  I looked at the stat blocks and wondered what they all meant.  I found the explanations at the beginning of the book and realized that we were missing actual rules.  I talked my mom into letting me buy (what would turn out to be) the Holmes Basic Set, read the rules that night, and started putting monsters into module B1: In Search of the Unknown (puke green edition).  Took a bit to explain the actual rules to my friend, but once we got real characters worked out we were on our way.

He moved away shortly thereafter, and when I found other kids who played, it turned out I was the only one who had bothered reading the rules, so I was forever after the DM.  Which is ironic because I'm not really a rules kind of guy."

planejane,AskWomen,1390841780.0,"One thing that irritates the crap out of me is that a lot of literotica is still very obviously written with the dude in mind. For example, take most M/F stories and look at the physical descriptions of the male vs female characters. It drives me crazy when the guy is barely described and the author waxes for 3 paragraphs about her perfect tiny breasts or her impossibly slim waist, or her generous, voluptuous derriere. 

The reason I think this happens is that it gives the reader (assumed male) an opportunity to put himself in the shoes of the male partner. For us girls, however, that appearance has been tightly defined, and personally, if I don't fit into that description, it causes a disconnect-especially if those descriptions keep popping up over the course of the story. 

That said, there's a certain amount of description that is beneficial. Usually generic things like ""contours of her body,"" etc. These kind of things let me actually connect with the girl getting her freak on."

Your wife needs mood stabilizers. Period.

My marriage ended when she cheated on me and I admitted that I didn't want to rebuild the relationship. During that I ran out of patience and protectiveness and started being completely honest about how I felt and not sparing her feelings anymore. And our relationship improved a lot, even though the marriage still ended. Maybe because I didn't respond to her normal manipulative crap anymore.

Anyway, my advice is to get out. We have to find our own happiness before we can share it with someone else. What does she have to share? If she isn't lifting you up, like you lift her, she isn't your wife anyway, you are her caretaker.

If you stay, it is time to stop betraying your own happiness for her. Stand up for what you know is right, stop betraying yourself for her. Be honest about how you feel and don't let her guilt you anymore. You are in an emotionally abusive codependent relationship, and you have the power to start standing up for yourself. It's time to do it. Things might get better if you do, and aren't likely to get any worse."

13 years old is old, and he needs to be able to open up to you and trust you.   You are past the point of teaching, and now should be guiding.  He needs to be given full responsibility over his life choices.  He should be doing his chores not for you but for him.  Don't do anything for him...laundry, cleaning, whatever.  You can have a structure to assist him, but it's time to teach him about adulthood.  For example, his online connection is a privilege he earns somehow, say through working for you, as part of any allowance he would have.

My journey through minimalism has not only been a reduction of possessions but a reduction of consumption. To me you still sound like you have a very consumeristic mindset, you mention brand names for just about every product you consume. Thats the kind of mindset that companies and advertisers want Americans to have.

•I too have a macbook (which I plan to get rid of) an iphone, and previously thought it was cool to own a moleskin even though I take all my notes on my phone (note I didn't say iPhone). 

•I highly suggest you watch this ted talk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo5cKRmJaf0 its about whats wrong with ted talks. 

•See [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/1vmkz6/lifestyle_why_i_am_cutting_back_on_reddit_and/) about why I want to stop browsing websites like reddit so much.

•I wouldn't define this my taste in beer as ""I drink expensive beer"", and I don't think that should be a part of anyones identity. I tell people I prefer local beers or microbrews. But I'm also not picky, I'll drink what I'm given even though I'm secretly a beer snob like you. I'm also a coffee, wine, shoe, car and cigar snob. But I don't tell anyone because nobody gives a shit unless they are too.

You're missing life. You're trying to get pleasure from consumption but the pleasure you will get won't lead you to happiness. You must first learn to change your idea of what makes you happy. If you can learn that happiness is obtained by living in the now and learning to enjoy it whether you're in prison or on vacation in Cancun, happiness will obtainable wherever, whenever.

As for jQuery being blocked, the point is that it shows the complete and utter failure of the given filter.

We started off at the hobby level by helping a friend.  Nothing I do seems to lean toward moderation.  If I get into something, my nature drives me to excess.  IE, if you are going to do something, don't fuck around, do it big.  

This is important:  There was a point. A point where you enact a life changing event.  A point where you have to ditch the secure comfort of taking paychecks and go out and make your own paycheck.  It is literally like jumping off the cliff believing that you can fly.  There is no parachute.

The laws regarding growing Medical Marijuana changed to where we could only grow for 5 of our 20+ patients unless we made the jump and got a Dispensary license.  Not wanting to kick our existing patients to the curb, we were forced into a decision.  It didn't take long, because it was the right thing to do.   We did not know we would make it.

I've mentioned a few times that I'm currently working as my Dad's caretaker. He has a blood disease and no longer produces platelets or white blood cells so he has no immune system and any cut, no matter how small, is a pretty serious thing. 

Yesterday, he got a nosebleed that just wouldn't stop and instead of telling us, he tried to take care of it himself. It didn't work. 

We finally got him to the hospital and he was admitted almost immediately but it was a couple hours before they managed to stop the nosebleed. Then when they tried to give him platelets, he had a bad reaction and ended up in a lot of pain and covered in welts. I have no idea when he'll be able to come home. I know my panic over a nosebleed may seem silly, but last time Dad was admitted it was for a fever that became a month long stay in a hospital several hours away. I spent weeks in an empty house, having my heart jump into my throat every time my phone rang. 

I'm really stressed out and pretty much scared to death. I had nightmares all night and feel like I barely slept a wink. Dad has faced worse before but his Doctors have made it clear they were expecting this mess to be a terminal diagnosis and that was two years ago. I should be happy, instead I'm terrified my Dad will just drop one day before my eyes.

You should try to write back with any additional email addresses you may have used (don't most people have more than one?), your full name and any names of people in your family that it may be under, the payment method, the dates that charges are going through. 

Unfortunately, from the emails, this support has a horrible response time and doesn't seem very helpful.

BullsLawDan,conspiratard,1390842656.0,"&gt;Banks are too big and have too much money BUT we also shouldn't have any government regulation of banks. 

Government regulation is precisely what got them into their current state.

&gt;Politicians have too much power because of corporate influence BUT corporations are people and should have no limits on campaign donations.

I doubt you can find a libertarian who has ever said that ""corporations are people""; like most of the politically unaware, your arguments against libertarianism rely heavily on making up what you think it actually is.  

Anyway, politicians don't have too much power ""because"" of corporate influence; politicians have too much power, which causes corporations to become interested in influencing them.  And why not?  If I told you that someone had literal control over your life and death, would you not have an interest in ""influencing"" their decision as to whether you should live or die?  Would you not do anything, break any law, exceed any regulatory spending limit, in order to make sure that politician didn't push the button that causes your demise?  Of course you would.

The real solution is to take away politicians' power to control that, not to try to prevent you from influencing them.

&gt;People are not making enough money BUT we should get rid of minimum wage.

If you understand basic economics - which I realize is a lofty assumption on reddit - you realize that arbitrarily raising wages is not a real solution.  If it were, the government could just make minimum wage $1 billion per year, and we could all live in mansions and drive Corvettes, right?  Similarly, I want a Corvette, but can't afford one.  Why doesn't the government just make a law saying Chevrolet cannot charge any more than $5 for a brand new Corvette?  Problems solved, right?  If you realize why those are ridiculous propositions, you already have in your head the knowledge to figure out why the minimum wage is no different."

bluemayhem,Feminism,1390842657.0,"If a woman wants to film herself having sex, and a man wants to watch it, I don't think that's anyone's business but theirs. 

A great deal of porn has weird unfortunate overtones, but it's fiction, and I don't find such fantasies any more distressing than people being into bondage or S&amp;M. People can discern reality from fantasy, and if they can't that's hardly the pornographer's fault, and I don't think anyone has the right to tell you what you can and can't watch in a fictional, staged setting, or that you are a bad person for what your fantasies are.

I think a lot of people's problem with porn starts with them finding it ickey and working backwards to explain why it's bad. For a lot of my life I was apprehensive about calling myself a feminist because I thought that they where all against porn, but as I started to meet more sex positive feminists I realized that not having a problem with it didn't disqualify me from the movement."

Ralkir,changemyview,1390842803.0,"&gt; It's simpler with a higher rate of success to look for the traits and conditions that correlate with cheating than to simply assume cheating with such small odds.

Well unfortunately I don't think they're that small. I'm not going to hold a gun to my head with a 30% chance I might die. I'm not gambling all my money on a 30% chance I might lose it all. &lt;- Think about that last one. It's not that there is a lack of trust, there is probably significant trust, but with a child in the picture all of a sudden the risk has increased, substantially.  

But you haven't got to the crux of my point. You claim to have a higher success rate looking for these traits. If it is that easy, then why do we have cheaters in the first place? The point is, these are every day people, people who even get married, and they experienced cheating. What makes me so much different than these people that makes me immune to a cheating partner. I'll answer it for you, it's nothing. So if there is no difference between people who were cheated on and people who weren't, then a little extra assurance helps people sleep at night. "

&gt;while the human is prone to sin, He himself didn't sin.

Ah, ok, so he wasn't actually human. Got it. It's literally like playing a game in ""god mode"" - you're not actually beating it when you're immune to the same challenges that others have. I don't see why it was so important for god to become human in the first place, but it really is pointless to try to attribute some sort of kudos to him for not sinning. According to the logic of your fellow christians, it was impossible for him to sin, anyhow. Even if Jesus had indulged and done anything from take Satan up on any of the offers made to him, or if he and Mary Magdalene had been doing the nasty-nasty, *it still wouldn't have been sin because god is incapable of sinning. His actions would've been proved righteous by virtue of the fact that he is supposedly the embodiment of righteousness.*

&gt; When He took the sins of the entire world, past, present and future, God the Father

Yeah, that's not true at all. Please provide scripture to back this up, specifically things that it was thought Jesus said, not from acid-trip Paul.

&gt;The Father had to administer the punishment that we deserve- because of our sin- on Jesus. 

To paraphrase - god was so mad that the people he gave free will to decided to actually *use* their free will, that he had to sacrifice himself to himself save them. Right. This makes a lot of sense. No, this makes *NO* sense. I know that it's not easy to hold this cognitive dissonance in your brain. Just let it go. Just admit to yourself that it doesn't make sense. You'll sleep a lot better at night.

&gt;That's how serious God is about sin. He didn't even spare His own Son. 

Again, let me paraphrase - that's how serious god is about not using free will. He didn't even spare himself. 

This doesn't sound like an all-powerful, all-knowing deity. This sounds like a 12 year old boy who's mad that things didn't go his way and is now feeling very regretful about his decisions. This is not love, this is not compassion, this is not forgiveness. It's the *opposite* of that. This is lunacy. This is self-absorption. We don't treat other humans this way because we fucking know better. We don't even treat our enemies in this way. We don't treat animals this way.

These stories are playing well to the base, but they weren't going to vote for her anyway.  For people like me, it seems mean-spirited and picking nits.  For friends of mine that are on the fence, it seems like a big deal about nothing.  

What I'm saying is, it's not having the intended effect, and the more you push it, the more it makes you look like poor sportsmen to the independents you need to attract.  

Here's why: we all fudge our histories a little bit.  Memory is funny, it's not perfect and every time we remember something, we remember it a little differently than it actually happened.  Worse, these remembrances change the story in our minds and we end up with discrepancies.   Her ""lies"" don't fundamentally change her story.   They're inaccurate, sure, but it's not like lying about having a Harvard degree when you don't -- a lie that you can't possibly believe to be true.  But if someone told me they graduated from Harvard in 1997 and I found out it was really 1998, I wouldn't think they deliberately lied to me. 

It doesn't appear her lies were deliberate because they're not really misleading.  What she said happened happened.  It happened a little differently, a year or two off here and a little embellishment about how hard it was there, but it wasn't a lie.

tangerinelion,buildapc,1390842955.0,"Resize your partition down (""shrink""), create a new partition out of the reclaimed space, move what you want to keep onto the new partition.  If it doesn't fit, defrag the original partition, resize it down again, and then expand the new partition.  Repeat as best you can.

When you install again be sure not to wipe out your new partition or the entire drive.  You want to install into the old partition and there may be something like a 100MB partition for the bootloader you can actually delete from the install CD.  You will actually have the choice of how big to make the windows partition.  Something like 100GB is more than sufficient.

Now, I suggest you leave the partitioning split-up this way.  Let Windows use 100GB for its C: partition, and the remainder of you drive is D:. The advantage here is if you need to re-install you will not lose your data on D:.  There is one caveat here, though, and that's your personal files and settings.  The Easy Transfer Wizard does a pretty good job of this, so I would suggest you also run the ETW prior to re-installing, and save the file to your new partition.  Once your reinstall is done, then run the ETW and restore from that file.

Lastly, once you reinstall odds are that you original C: partition was never able to be shrunk down to 100GB but upon reinstall you can use only 100GB of that original partition (ie, delete just that partition and create a new one of 100GB).  You'll want to expand your D: after reinstall to claim the full size available.

For example with Steam, you can set it to save games to your D: partition.  You'll be surprised how 100GB is enough for the OS when your data is almost all elsewhere leaving just programs on C:."

The market did not pick up on this as a problem until it was too late and the whole house of cards came crashing down.

I don't see your point.  Is or is there not a federal register with literally thousands of pages of regulation regarding banks?  The only reason banks got into that situation, and the only reason they grew to be ""too big to fail,"" was because of government regulation that led us to that point.

If government regulation required a gun to have a hair trigger, and use explosive hollow point bullets, and fire whenever someone made a sound in their vicinity, and be pointed at humans at all times, when someone got killed you'd say ""That person died because there was no regulation forcing them to wear a bullet-proof vest!""

Or everyone is just upvoting the comments that agree with their conclusion ""women are whores that like monster cocks (because porn told me so)"" and downvoting all the ones that don't agree.

Every single conversation I've had with my female friends -- *every single one* -- on the topic went something along the lines of girth is nice, a pencil dick is not. But where it's really at is a guy who's good with his mouth, and knows where the fucking clitoris is. Oh, and that pounding away like a jackhammer for thirty minutes without so much as touching the happy button is really uncomfortable.

Actually, a lot of women I've known complain about that sort of jackhammering and lack of foreplay and clitoris touching. Especially the ones that have casual sex more often than not. They'll make disparaging comments like ""does he expect me to get off to a dildo on a piston? Someone's been watching too much porn. This is why I fake orgasms.""

Because you're so starved for romantic and emotional attention, emotionally, you truly put every part of yourself into that first relationship. When it inevitably fails (because no healthy relationship can function when one person is so dependent on the other for psychological support), you only have two points of reference. Before your SO, and with your SO. 

You may even know, intellectually, that life will go on. However, emotionally, sub-consciously, it doesn't feel that way for a long time. Your brain only remembers that it didn't feel lonely when SO was around. It doesn't yet know, intuitively, that it wasn't SO specifically that was special, but the human and emotional companionship that a relationship provides. As you try to move one, the first few minor relationships end up being pale imitations, because you refuse to invest like you did the first time. This only reinforces the initial mis-perception.  

It can take *years* to dig yourself out of this sort of crippling loneliness.

That's the point: It was confirmed to him by a mutual friend and then she refuses to admit it.

In other words, she feels there's good reason to not tell him about it, meaning she doesn't trust the outcome will be good if she tells him.

No.  Privatize losses.  No corporations should get bailed out.  The fundamental aspect of a free market is the danger of failure, which currently does not exist due to --- regulation."

I could easily make the case that although I wasn't *legally* divorced until 2007, I effectively divorced my wife right after she got served in 2006.   The only reason it took longer is because the state said we couldn't do it that fast and they had to look over the documents.  "

Generally (but usually not in BM, i'm talking regular levels or if you're in a safe spot trying to figure out how to deal with the shopkeep) you can take your time as well.

So looks like the whole ""women like their clit touched more than they like monster dicks"" is probably going to be affirmed by sex toy purchasing patterns. Rabbits and such are really popular as well, and not because they're just a dildo. It's a dildo that vibrates, and hits the g-spot and clit at the same time.

Considering that sex toy purchasers are probably kinkier than the average person, I'm willing to bet that the pattern holds strong throughout the population."

sitapixie1,relationships,1390843663.0,"Oh this hits a  bit close to home. My mom died 4 years ago in hospice care due to colon cancer. 3 months later, my aunt died in the hospital due to ovarian cancer that was diagnosed at stage 4. My mom was fighting the cancer for 13 months before she passed away so we had a bit of warning but my aunt (who was really like a 2nd mom) was a total shock. She went into the hospital at the beginning of September for ""stomach problems"", got diagnosed with cancer a few days later, and died within 30 days. Between my mom dying and my aunt dying, our small family pretty much fell apart. 

When my mom got to the point of where it seemed like she would die, my older brother (who lives on the East coast) couldn't decide on whether or not he should try to fly over. Before he decided on flying out (he said he wasn't going to because he didn't think he'd get there in time), I told my mom that she did everything she could and that she didn't have to fight anymore. It wasn't as easy as it sounds and there was lots of crying involved. About 2 hours after that my older brother decided to hop on a plane to fly over to the PNW. He didn't make it in time to see her. No one blames me but I still feel horribly guilty over it. I know this is self inflicted guilt because he told me that he was a bit relieved to not see her die so he can hang on to his memories of when she was still alive and fairly healthy. 

**You aren't heartless for telling your dad it was ok to go.** I feel like I can't tell you this enough. When I told my mom that if she didn't want to fight anymore and if she wanted to go, as sad as it was, I think she was a bit relieved (although a bit scared because she wasn't ready) to hear that. She was in so much pain that I like to think that she was relieved to not have to deal with or fight against the pain anymore (morphine wasn't really working for the pain). I think people who haven't been in this situation have no idea how hard those words are to say to a parent or person you love so much.

I think your aunt is not dealing with your father's death. Like Zoefic (sorry don't know how to link a user's name yet) said, she may have had something that she wasn't dealing with between herself and your father that wasn't resolved and now she is angry that she can't resolve it or that she wasn't able to say whatever it was to your father. 

Unfortunately for you, instead of being angry in general at your father for dying before she was able to do this and dealing with or working through this, your aunt seems to have decided to direct all her anger at you. Probably because it's easier to have a living target for her anger so she can actually act on it than her actually dealing with why she feels this way. This way she can also escape feeling angry towards your father for dying and not ""letting her"" resolve any issues that she may have had with your father.

**This isn't your fault at all.**

My experience with this type of situation is through my twin sister. She and I have always had a rocky relationship our whole lives but she and I both have changed due to the loss of our mom and aunt. She became a lot more controlling, more angry  and short tempered in general, and a bit more irrational about things. She's always been a bit this way but it got worse after they died. I was changed through this by not having the ""patience"" to deal with this and saying ""I'm not putting up with my sister bullying me anymore to get her way"". Needless to say, we got in a huge fight. After a bit of back and forth with emails (she didn't want to talk over the phone/in person) I apologized and set a line of ""if you do this x, y, or z behavior again, I'm gonna have to take another break from talking to you"". She cut off all communication with me because she is still so angry about everything. Haven't had any contact with her for over a year. I figure when she is willing to work through our issues, I'll hear from her. 

I'm not saying you have to take a break from contact with your aunt but you may have to for your own health. The hardest lesson I've learned as I've gotten older is that sometimes you have to draw a line and say 'enough' to someone no matter how much you care for them.

For you and the rest of your family, I hope your aunt eventually works through this anger and gets some help in dealing with the loss of your father. *hug*

bobbyg27,GameDeals,1390843700.0,"I don't think piracy is the only reason PC prices are low. Mostly it's because of the marginal cost of the product; there is none, aside from fees the retailers charge (which is still I'm sure much smaller than what physical copies of games have give to retailers).

Think about buying, distribution, inventory, or the in-store costs of stocking, tagging, putting the product in the print ad.  All of these costs are avoided by digital distribution.

The used game market is also very penalizing for the physical game market, because the developers/publishers get exactly $0 from a used game sale, while a potential customer is getting the full or nearly-full value from that exchange.  Digital distribution, by preventing second-hand markets (mostly), help keep the money in developers' and publishers' hands, which enables them to do heavy discounts to get volume on their relatively cost-free product.

I think piracy is of extremely minor concern for game developers. If piracy was the reason PC game prices were low, you'd see a drastic shift away from PC game development since the margins would just be deflated from this non-business reason.  No, I think the real reason for PC game pricing is the business structure of the digital-only product model.

By the way, I'm definitely not advocating piracy. It is damaging to the industry, for sure, and it's illegal, as I believe it should be.  I am proud to be a non-pirate PC gamer."

I live in Norway and we have this thing where we in junior high school travel to Germany and Poland and visit different concentration camps. I did this a couple of years ago and we visited: Auschwitz Birkenau, Sachsenhausen and Ravensbrück. We learned a lot about the holocaust from it. We also read books about the holocaust in advance and reviewed them to our class.

It is a pretty common thing and most of the schools in Norway, at least in Oslo, do this if they can gather enough money for it.

To be honest I don't know if it actually is on the curriculum or not, but I would find it weird if it isn't. I can ask a social studies teacher at my school about it.

I do all of that, I have no source of in-game income (no crafting class over 30ish and only 50 fisher), I don't do dailies, and I've done everything you've mentioned.  

It was easier making money on the side when you could sell potash/coke/etc for like 30k a pop, but its so cheap now its pointless.  I've been sitting at capped Philo for like a month now.  Likewise, crafting gear was a lot more expensive back then too.  Its all dirt cheap now.  And food lasting through death has also reduced the cost, and increased its longevity.

And really, no one needs VIT melds anymore.  That's what ilvl80 gear is for.  The only reason we all melded VIT was because we had a huge gap between ilvl70 (Darklilght) and ilvl90 (Allagan).

I know he was the host of Whose Line Is It Anyway, so he does have experience in adlib comedy, but he was the host for that so always had notes.

Also, there are vendors I don't need to talk to much until closer to my wedding; floral, catering, baker:  I don't have any questions for them after the original decision was made until we get a month or two out from the wedding.

My venue has been great about answering questions.  Since most other vendors need to know the address, layout, size, etc of the venue, I've emailed them quite a lot, and had very fast replies.


Hopefully a few phone calls will get you answers faster; it's silly that a lot of planners complain about no one responding to their emails, when they never even try to call their vendor.

This game would not even load for me until I built a new PC in December, so I didn't start playing until after Christmas. My first campaign was a disaster, I did the epilogue fine, then started my actual campaign. I beat the Etruscans easily and very quickly, Carthage declared war on me...fine, I can handle that. Then the Veneti declared war on me, ok, two front war, no problem.

Then over the next 15 turns, while only playing defense, Athens, Sparta, Epirus Ardiaie, Macedon, Scordiscii and more declared war on me! Agents spammed all my cities destroying every building, every turn. Athens took Southern Italy,Veneti took Rome, I ran out of money and suffered attrition, and held only Syracusae, I rage quit that one. I'm a veteran TW player, since original Shogun, and I've never suffered such a ridiculous amount of war declarations, agent attacks and defeats at once.

Started a new campaign, and the same started happening again, but with different factions declaring war! No one ever accepted peace treaties, non-aggression or trade, and while I fared better, taking all of Sicily and Venice, I was back to playing defense against 30 enemies.

So I looked for mods. Radious mod gives your cities better garrisons (no one ever used knife wielding peasants in real life garrisons anyway, ugh), makes diplomacy work a little more (factions accept agreements more often if friendly) and there is better faction balancing. This helped a ton and allowed me defeat Carthage.

However, it took me like 100 game years just to take Italia, Magna Graecia, Corisica+Sardinia and the city of Carthage + Patavium. Even with Radious, I still ended up surrounded by enemies. Every faction in Greece/Thracia was my enemy. Nova Carthago had conquered the earth in this time, all of Spain, most of Africa and agent spammed me in Carthage every turn.

In the north, various tribes joined together and attacked. Once the Scordiscii even took Patavium, Arminium and Velathri from me and attemped to take Rome before I beat them back! 

After building multiple full stacks and every agent I could muster, I slowly started to make progress, taking Cisalpania and two Alpine cities north and Masillia from the Gallic Confed. but then I became stuck. I needed to play defense at nearly every city, every turn and couldn't afford more armies.

Worse, I had the Gallic Confederation beaten utterly, one secondary city left and I had take out all their armies. Will they broker peace? No. Will they become a client? No. How about if I pay them 6,000 denarii? Nope. And their last city was too far away and too dangerous for me to take.

So I wondered if there was an add on that made diplomacy a bit more realistic, like if a faction were crushed, they should agree to at least peace to save themselves, right? I found it, called Easy Peacy Diplomacy. This mod doesn't make diplomacy *that* much easier, but when I have beaten a faction to one or two cities and am threatening, they almost always offer peace now. Also, trade agreements come to me when there are common enemies, as does peace and military alliance (they often break these when the war is over). No this is more like real life, you can actually have allies to help you, wow!

With Radious and Easy Peacy, this game became more playable, but not easy. I have logged over 120 hours of playtime in just 1 month and I still have not beaten the main campaign on Normal. The AI is sneaky and intelligent, they often come around and take unprotected cities while I make other attacks, they form evil alliances that surround me and bordering states will cancel non-aggression/military access when I need it most.

It took me 140 game years to defeat just Nova Carthago and Libya. I'm in 53 AD now, control all of North Africa up to my allies who I share Egypt with. I control most of Spain but one provice, Dacia and Thracia are mine as are several cities in Germany/France. But I have made no headway toward England and the Boii, who control all the way to Russia and Denmark just declared war on me!

Armenia is also held by an ally surrounded by allies (we are all allied) so taking it will incur a likely massive war I can't fight or win right now.

It's likely this game on normal will take me another 100 - 200 years to win and possibly another 100 hours.

So if Rome II seemed ""easy"" at first to people playing in September, come back and try playing as Rome on normal, and it will likely take you 100+ hours to win the campaign or even gain stability. "

People keep bringing up the point that this new censorship blockade system is optional, privately operated and exists on the ISP level as if it's some sort of an explanation. What is frequently neglected is that these systems, whilst not legally mandated by the state are a result of Cameron's ""war on whatever he deems obscene"". ISPs did not self-elect to begin censoring their networks, it could never benefit them to do so. They have done so as a gesture of appeasement and even if the existence of a filtering option was beneficial, they certainly didn't want to make it a mandatory, default true choice for all subscribers.

If I may pitch in with a suggestion though, I think you should improve your overall vocabulary and sentence making before going after face-to-face exchanges. In my small and limited experience with language learning, chatting face to face is not even worth the time if you can barely pick up the right word when writing a simple letter/post.

My native language is the same as yours and although my conversational skills(direct face-to-face talk) might need a lot of work still, I went a long way before needing any kind of face-to-face talk. Improve your ability with the written language by getting more exposure(books, audiobooks, movies), at that point conversational skills might be much easier to develop and they'll just need a bit of steady-talking grease to catch up. 

On the other hand, if you have problems with vocabulary and syntax it'll be much more difficult to improve your conversations by just chatting (mostly because exposure when chatting is very limited and just improves muscle memory for the most part)

Just my two cents."

2. You do not need antivirus on your mac. Do not install it, as it's pretty much a waste of your time and money and system resources.

3. Set up time machine backups immediately. http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1427 Time machine is painless automated backup. You'll want an external hard drive for this. One of the videos goes over this. 

4. Make sure you set up iCloud - it includes the Find My Mac service in case your mac is ever lost/stolen, it'll give you a chance to recover it. It also will sync any contacts/calendar info/reminders/notes and more between your iPhone and mac. :) This can be done by going to System Preferences &gt;&gt; iCloud.

5. Most of the native software on OS X is really really good. Don't download alternatives until you've given all of it a chance. I haven't had to install a different email client, or anything like that. I still use safari for web browsing, etc.

6. If you want to run a second operating system simultaneously (virtualized) use Virtualbox(free), or VmWare Fusion($60). I use VmWare Fusion because the interface is much friendlier, etc. If you want to play games on your mac, use bootcamp, and partition the mac to install windows. Warning! DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PARTITION TOOLS BESIDES BOOTCAMP, which already comes on every mac. The mac file system is a bit different, and you can mess up things by using a partition tool that isn't designed to handle this... One of the videos in step 1 talks about this. :) 

7. You get a home folder, with your name on it (whatever you choose). Set finder to always open to this folder (In the menu bar at the top, click Finder &gt;&gt; Preferences &gt;&gt; General &gt;&gt; New Finder Windows show ______. and select your home folder (the one with the house icon) from the drop down. Keep all your files in your home folder! this will ensure that they get backed up, and will keep you from getting disorganized. 

8. Okay, so besides all that, the hotkeys on OS X are basically the same as windows. They just use the Cmd key instead of the Ctrl key. :) Press the Cmd Key with your thumb (that's why it's right there on the keyboard) and then tap C to copy V to paste, X to cut. W to close a window, Z to undo. Shift + Cmd + [key] typically does the opposite of a function. Shift Cmd Z = redo, for example. 

9. If you're an experienced linux user, you'll *love* the OS X terminal. The commands are almost the exact same. Help, Cd, Sudo, ls, etc. You'll feel right at home here :) If not, don't worry. You don't have to use terminal for anything in OS X. 

10. All system settings are under System Preferences. All application preferences are under the menu bar name for that application and then ""Preferences"" - for example, ""Finder &gt; Preferences"" and ""iTunes &gt; Preferences"" will get you to the preferences for each application. Menus are consistent, which is what makes OS X so easy to use :) This isn't just for menus. Most everything is consistent, across applications, and everything else. For example, the sidebars behave the same way in each app. 

11. Use the help menus! :D They let you search for commands, instead of the useless help and support documents that windows typically gives you. [Here's what i mean](http://www.acrobatfaq.com/atbref5/images/TBX_v5_0_0_Menu_Apple_Help.png) - It's really helpful when you can't find something you know exists... :) 

12. Finally... When in doubt... ask yourself ""What would a 5 year old do"" and use click/drag to do it. :D The beauty of OS X is that it's powerful, but also deeply accessible.

13. Most applications that you may be familiar with are available on OS X. Applications like Microsoft Office, Chrome, etc. However... before you splurge on them, give the OS X native applications a chance! I cannot stress this enough. If pages does everything you need it to do, don't spend extra $$ on MS Word. Same goes for pro versions of apple apps. The inbuilt apps aren't like the ones on windows - they are powerful and capable. Use iPhoto and iMovie. If you find that you are actually hitting their upper limits (in terms of what you'd like to do) consider moving to Aperture, Lightroom or Final Cut Pro X. But don't just buy those apps right away. The native apps really are VERY good. :) 

14. Install this app from the mac app store to handle zipping/unzipping of nonstandard formats. [The Unarchiver](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?mt=12) It's free, and very good! "

In the conspiracy community, I don't think that ""Zionism"" has taken on different connotations. I've never really heard that word, preceded by ""anti-,"" used by anyone there who didn't believe in laughably absurd antisemitic bullshit. Plenty of people there (and in that cesspit /r/worldnews) do argue that Israel shouldn't exist.

I don't know, it's a bit like someone claiming that the term ""white rights"" isn't usually used in context of racist bullshit. When racist assholes are freely throwing around the term ""white rights,"" people that aren't racist assholes should go for more precise terms. Otherwise, you're going to be mistaken for a racist asshole, and that's really no one's fault but your own."
namesaremptynoise,AskReddit,1390844194.0,You can pick a theme or a restaurant or whatever...  Planning the whole thing yourself is somewhere between egotistical and pathetic.
JamesGray,AskMen,1390844194.0,"The fact that you feel the need to defend your position on what constitutes a virtue through the language you used is what implies you feel threatened by opposing opinions. There's absolutely no reason for you to be injecting your own values into the discussion in such a grating way if you actually feel confident in yourself without external validation. I mean, why put so much acid into what you're saying if you're not lashing out at people who disagree?

Furthermore, I'm not sure where you get the idea that I'm acting as though I'm being victimized here, but that's not the case at all. Heck, I'm not even really effeminate at all, I just don't have quite all of the hangups on acting stereotypically masculine or feminine- so I do whatever I want to, regardless of what gender my tastes or behaviours may be associated with by people like you. And despite your assertion that I apparently must turn to mush several times a day, I actually have no problem dealing with conflict or directly confronting people when I have an issue. I just tend to try to do it in a more diplomatic way when I feel the situation warrants it.

What you may be mistaking for some sort of defensiveness from me is the fact that I take issue with saying things that will make *other people* feel even worse about something they're already struggling with. There is no objective right and wrong when it comes to things like this, and even with your best effort (at least you said ""I consider"", I guess) you still managed to use very abrasive language, attacking them for their identity. If you'd like to try interacting in the modern world and actually use some sensitivity as to how your behaviour might hurt other people needlessly, you could still easily ask basically the same question without all the built-in judgement to just try to actually understand opposing perspectives.

I mean, shit- I don't exactly think it's a virtue to not be able to handle a little razzing, or even someone being an outright asshole, but that doesn't mean I think it's okay to knowingly make other people feel like shit. Just because those same things don't bother you doesn't mean the ""golden rule"" doesn't apply. You wouldn't want someone to do something that did genuinely make you feel bad, so why not put just a modicum of effort into not making other people feel like shit needlessly?"

beefcakez,bodybuilding,1390844266.0,"My recommendation, aside from ignoring all the idiotic and humorous posts in this thread, is to not strive for an external 'goal physique' anyway. 

You're setting yourself up for disappointment by doing so. Your physique will never look like theirs. Not to say that it won't be impressive, but your physical structure is completely different. 

Evaluate ***your*** physique and strive to make *your* body the best it can be. 

After a competition I'll draw over my contest photos and mark up what I think I can change to make my physique more impressive. You may find that helpful, as you cannot alter the insertion points of your muscles, nor can you alter your bone structure (through training). It gives me an attainable goal to work for and helps me work on highlighting weakpoints and maintaining and improving strong points.

MaximilianKohler,anonymous123421,1390844326.0,"&gt; A man that chooses not to contribute to the care and well being of his own children is not deserving of pity, nor is a woman who chooses the same. The fact that a woman can abort a pregnancy is irrelevant to the responsibilities associated with parenthood. 

Ok, this is where the disagreement/misunderstanding comes in. You seem to be operating on the premise that the father agreed to have the child. However, the image is referring to the ability of the mother to have a child without the father's consent.

If there is an accidental pregnancy and the father does not want to and/or does not have the ability to raise a child yet the mother decides that she wants to force this responsibility on the father, then yes I think ""pity"" for the father is perfectly reasonable since he is being forced into something he does not want.

As far as the father's legal responsibilities in cases where the father does not want the child but the woman has the baby anyways, do you know what those are?

I'm certainly going to avoid having sex with girls who don't agree to have an abortion in the case of an accidental pregnancy in the future if I find out I'm going to be stuck with a legal responsibility."

I make around $24,000 per year as an ophthalmic assistant, and pull in about $4,000 extra per year with a photography business.  My wife makes much more than me as a web developer, I think around $50,000 per year, so our combined yearly income is about $79,000.  We are currently renting, paying $13,800 per year for rent, not including utilities.  We both have cars that are paid off.  We both have student loans that will be paid off in 5-10 years.  We both have good credit.

We recently came into some money through various life events, and now have around $100,000 extra floating around, and we are trying to figure out what to do with it.

We were married recently, and would like to buy a house, and plan to have kids eventually.  We are interested in investing, but have no idea where to start.  My wife is very interested in house-flipping as an investment, but neither of us are even remotely handy, and I am extremely short on time with my two jobs, so I am skeptical.  She also threw out the idea of living in a duplex and fixing up one side while renting the other, but again, with my lack of time and knowledge, I am hesitant to dive into the murky waters of property management.

Our goal, in addition to a nice home and a family, is for me to grow my photo business to the point that it's my gainful employment and I can quit my day job, and use the income from the photo business to supplement a martial arts school.

I know that we are intelligent and ambitious enough to make it happen, but we need some guidance.

The super bowl should determine who the best team was on that day and I think that the weather takes away from that. 


That being said the weather is really unpredictable that far in advance so if the NFL wants to put it in outdoor places its their decision and teams have to deal with it. I think it would be pretty cool if there was a stadium that was only used for the super bowl but that's a little too much to expect.

You know, the whole ""I like dresses and makeup, therefore I'm a girl"" crap. It's often tossed around here, but in reality very few trans women think this. 

I got off track here. The distinction is that we can respect each other and discuss gender without seeing each other as a threat. We can treat each other with mutual respect, but here, every trans woman is an offense in her very existence. We are people to be mocked and dismissed out of hand. This little ""internet war"" we've got going on, it's bullshit. Which is why I purposely try to overcome it. I like finding common ground and moving forward together, even in disagreement. "

Spoke too soon. Yep, foster care is awesome and women are irresponsible whores using abortion as birth control, despite the fact that most women who have abortions [were using contraceptives](http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_induced_abortion.html) or thought they weren't fertile.

Another very popular (and much easier) position is [this one](http://imgur.com/yDbKKO0).^^SFW  Note the use of a supporting pillow under the butt. If you're not too big you might not need the pillow, but they do make special wedge shaped pillows for exactly this kind of purpose.

I have sensitive skin and have had problems with hormonal acne and redness and they have seemed to calm down a lot by switching to a quality cosmetic.  Also, make sure you clean your application brushes often and/or use a new sponge every time you apply make up to your face.  Washing your face with gentle products as well as your brushes with a gentle cleanser will also help with the spread of any type of reactions.

You seriously don't understand self regulation at all. I'm not saying I have answers, I'm saying I'd rather be free in a society which is less safe and less comfortable, than be told what to do, what to think, whats right and wrong.

Than be constantly lied to telling us we live in a democracy when we sure as shit don't, I have no say, you have no say. Politicians are going to do whatever the hell they want regardless and then tell us we want it, or it's good for society.

I don't want to live in a society, which treats workers like objects and believes some men better than others just because of their possessions. That manipulates the dulled masses through media control and poor education.

It's a shite state of affairs, I believe every man should have the right to make a fair living if he works hard - to have nice things, to have the means to do things for his family and his community. Not to work 80 hours a week and have nothing to show for it and then to lose your job just because someone who has everything they could ever want or need wants to make a little more money.

I'm not saying lets have a society where everyone just kills and fucks each other over for money, I believe in community and societal consensus, real democracy, I'm alluding toward anarcho syndicalism.

Our governments in the developed world, they stand by and watch as powerful men abuse the people, as small business owners are screwed into the ground by big business, a society where the people who work all their life in their old age are entitled to less than those who never lifted a finger and people who go into work every day and do a damn fine job are treated like farm animals, disposed of like nothing.
All the while the rich men are made richer by their influence in government and the bearing they can have on poorly understood measures of ""How well we are doing"", draining economies dry and never paying their dues.

We're lied to consistently, telling us that things are better than ever, more people are employed, wages are up, standards of living are amazing and we're all just one big happy community. And it's all lies from politicians incapable of doing their jobs. They have ONE job above all, look after your constituency. And I sure as shit am not seeing that, from any of the major powers in Europe.

In our society, Government does no good, it just stands in the way of uprising, of revolution and change."
Zerbo,ems,1390844998.0,"I had a call along these lines a couple weeks ago. Dispatched as a pregnancy problem for a 19 year old, possible hemorrhage. We get there and are greeted at the door by a hysterical middle-aged woman yelling and crying in Spanish. We walk in and find a younger girl sitting on the couch on her iPad, looking completely nonchalant. Doesn't even look at us when we come in. The ankles and crotch of her sweatpants are soaked in blood. I have my EMT partner start getting her vitals, and meanwhile the older lady is screaming in Spanish, ""The baby, the baby!""  and points to a bathroom down the hallway. I peek in, and don't see immediately see anything. But I noticed blood at the edge of the bathtub, look in, and see a fetus about the size and color of a sprained thumb nestled in the drain, umbilical cord and all. So I have my preceptor get the fetus wrapped up while I'm trying to talk to the patient to find out what happened... apparently she was 16 weeks pregnant, grava 1 para 0, started bleeding, then decided to just squat it out and push in the bathtub with her pants around her ankles. Once the fetus came out with the discharge, she tore the umbilical cord with her hands, pulled up her pants, and went back to couch to start facebooking. So the older lady (patient's mom, presumably) is in absolute hysterics while I'm trying to explain to her in my horribly broken Spanish that I'm sorry, and there's nothing we can do for a spontaneously miscarried fetus with such a low gestational age. She doesn't believe me and calls the police. Meanwhile the patient is trying to AMA despite the fact that she's still actively bleeding.

Police arrive and we have to tell them the whole story, while the patient's mother is still an absolute wreck and pointing at us yelling (in English now, surprisingly) ""They do NOTHING! They do NOTHING!"" So the police take her to another room, and the patient starts getting aggressive about not wanting to go to the hospital. She gets combative, the mother slaps the police officer that was translating for us and is subsequently handcuffed, and we end up restraining the patient who had then become combative and transporting her with a combine pad between her legs with a police officer on board.

When we dropped the patient and fetal remains off at the hospital my preceptor asked me how I think I did on that call. I told him, ""I'll let you know as soon as I figure out what the fuck just happened."" His reply was simply, ""Yeah, me too,"" and it hasn't been brought up since."

It doesn't offend me that someone liked it as well and is using it for food instead. I love that it's still being used and isn't just an art piece in the corner. It has pride of place in the middle of their kitchen as their only work surface, so they obviously love it. It just annoyed me that people were poo-pooing this decision with snarky comments. 


I may have been a bit hyperbolic when I said they are thrown away all the time. I was mostly talking about ""newer"" models (made in the last 80 years) that are stacked in the corners of schools or YMCA's as woodworking and shop classes have been shut down. Or people getting rid of their dad's or grandpa's dusty bench that has been sitting in the garage for years and they just see a massive heavy hinderance that is banged up and dirty and they don't think it has value. And much of that value has come from these tables becoming desirable in home decor. While I'm sure there are woodworking collectors out there, I don't think they are so huge as to make the growing prices of these tables as high as they are. A lot of woodworkers also choose to build their own rather than pay for a vintage one.

danhakimi,philosophy,1390845349.0,"&gt; So, Native Americans didn't own anything, but when America took it they gained ownership?

Naw. They started talking as though they did.

Property is not a natural right. It's a government-made one. Its justification is rooted in the justification of the government. That anybody is excluded from stepping on to any land anywhere is only valid insofar as the inception of the state is invalid. There is probably a problem in the inception of the United States, or in its declaration of dominion over the territory it now controls.

&gt; They didn't have a sales receipt for the land they lived on so they didn't *really* own it?

No, they didn't *really* own it because it was land. They didn't treat it *like* they owned it because they didn't have a government that decided to give them some property-like right.

&gt; If I went to an island only inhabited by tribal people, and I was sponsored by a state, is it acceptable for me to say I own their tools, huts, food, etc. because they don't have ""real property,* but I (because of the legitimacy of the state) do?

No -- you don't any more than they do, but you do have the right, on the authorization of your state, to exclude other citizens of your state. And states may generally negotiate similar rights with one another as they see fit -- although war seems to, at least usually, be in excess of that negotiation power.

&gt; They did participate in trade and all, isn't that evidence enough that they had an economic system around the idea of property?

I guess. I'm trying to get around what actually happened, which I don't care about, and get to philosophy, which I do care about."

I found it really annoying that you had to weed out all the ones who looked just at your pictures and disregarded your whole profile and just wanted a hook-up for one night.  Maybe 7 out of the 10 people who respond to you are only looking for one night stands or just someone to hook up with, and that is a strong maybe.  I dont disregard it completely as my mom and dad both have found long term significant others, 7+ years, while online.

icepyrox,defaultgems,1390845453.0,"While I did date a girl in HS, that was for 2 months and she cheated on me. By the time I was your age, that was my only relationship. I didn't lose my virginity until I was 31. That was my longest relationship of 3 years and she cheated on me several times and I knew. I've dated once since then and things are still messed up, though thankfully life was in the way and not another guy.

Several times I've admitted to myself that the only reason I'm alive is because I haven't killed myself. However, just like that OP, I am not giving up. I've started being social, I've started joining activities like bowling and have now started being included in other social stuff and even have a party next weekend to attend.

I was just in /r/AskMen and a girl posted about being one of the guys and being told she's scary. One person's comment rings true with me. Adapting it to you, I would say you are FA because YOU ARE FA. You think you are alone, therefore you are alone. You wouldn't recognize someone wanting to be a friend even if they punched you in the face and said they're your friend. You hang out in FA, you see what they do, you recognize a connection, but everyone there is Forever Alone BECAUSE they are in FA. Hell, in theory, there should be a meetup and everyone would become friends with so much in common, but that wouldn't happen because they are forever alone. Get out of there. Stop doing that shit. I bet people would talk to you if you had something to talk about except being FA. I bet people would invite you to stuff if you seemed interested in doing stuff. GET INTERESTED. I'd even bet you've been invited but turned it down because you were too busy being alone. 

Don't be like that OP and just rollercoaster through hell either. Find a hobby. Talk about the music you like and find people that like that. Talk about grad school. I dropped out of college and you're finishing grad school! You still have a clean slate and didn't get messed up by relationships as I did, so while you probably will fail a few times, there's a better chance of you finding a healthy partner than me just through sheer innocence as long as you stop being FA.

Damnit, now I gotta go to work pissed though I want to write more. I just wish I had caught this yesterday, but instead, I loaded the page and waited until today to read thinking I could just read and not reply. Sorry.

TL;DR- You should be punched in the face just for good measure if you think your life is that bad."

Or if three employees were doing the same job but you wanted the machine to have the throughput of those three workers then you need some serious engineering and manufacturing of that machine - and not just some pneumatic tubes, switches and actuators.

Automation has its place in the balance of things. If you're a small manufacturer wanting to make the leap to middle-sized manufacturer then the main thing that you're probably looking for is some kind of assembly-line automation that's going to be utilized almost full-time with the greatest impact on productivity and efficiency.

I count something as saying, ""She has such a pretty face; she'd be so pretty if she were thin"" as a derogatory comment to make, no matter how passive and well intentioned it is. 

We can all think whatever we'd like in our heads. To voice these comments is rude and only serves to either hurt someone or to make yourself feel better, and sometimes both. Again, my experience is limited as I don't often witness these types of comments. I don't know if it's because I don't hear them directed at myself, or the people I hang out with or places I hang out in, but I don't see it happen too often. When I do, I find it immature and nasty."
rockspeak,weddingplanning,1390845615.0,"I don't think 10 weeks is a huge deal, but 8 weeks is more common.  The whole ""second wave"" of invites sounds so shitty, but it's what I plan to do, too, because it's the best way for me to be able to invite the most number of people.  

We can't afford a larger venue, so we had to make the hard choice of ""A"" list and ""B"" list, and if we get some RSVP-nos, we can invite people on the ""B"" list.  No one we're inviting is a jerk, but if they *do* ask about it, or figure out they're in the second ""wave,"" I'll simply tell them the truth."

Iamyourbetter,DebateReligion,1390845620.0,"In the Book of Mormon the prophet Nephi is commanded by God to kill a man named Laban to obtain metal plates which contain a historical and spiritual record of the Hebrews.

Nephi comes across Laban passed out drunk on the streets of Jerusalem, and is then told to take Laban's sword and kill him. Nephi initially questions the command, but is told by God that it would be better for one man perish than to have an entire nation dwindle in disbelief. So Nephi kills him, takes his clothes as a disguise, gets the records through trickery and then escapes with his family into the wilderness.

This is just one example. I appears that Christianity sometimes views overall eternal salvation at the expense of temporal well being. The belief can be contradictory, and abused by those in power."

And here's the thing: we live very ecologically irresponsibly nowadays. The carbon footprint of that many people before we figure out sustainable resources will end up with our atmosphere looking like China's. I would rather not be asshole-to-elbow with strangers, breathing in toxic waste. Where is the waste of a population that large going to go?? 

Our population isn't super dense. But we are not having any problems maintaining our country due to underpopulation. So why screw up a good thing? Already, jobs that pay enough to support a family are relatively scarce. Increased population means a dramatic increase in unsustainable and cruel farming. That all has an absurd carbon footprint.

Fizjig,Leathercraft,1390845731.0,"All of the above mentioned tips are good. I would also add that if your items are unique enough you can try selling them on Etsy.com or other handmade goods sites online. 

It's very tough to bridge the gap between a hobby and a business though. There has to be something unique to your work that makes it stand out from the dozens of other leather workers selling stuff. 

Find one item that you are good at making. Then practice perfecting your ability to make that item. Quality always trumps quantity in the leather world. Don't cut corners on materials. It shows glaringly in the final product. If you want to make lots of money you have to use materials that warrant the cost. 

Remember your time is worth more than the money a single project will net. I'd rather sell a 60.00 bag that I can make a dozen of a week than a 200.00 bag I can make one of every two weeks. 

If you want to sell local your best bet is word of mouth networking. I made an item for a charity auction. I made no money off it (except a tax write off) but, because of the exposure the bag got being auctioned off it lead to a boatload of commission orders for people that wanted the same bag made. 

The first 2 bags I sold paid for all the material for future orders and the rest was pure profit. 

Unless you are a leather savant don't expect to get rich doing leather working. Treat it as a way to bring in some extra cash and if it takes off beyond that great. If not, make sure you still have something to fall back on. "

clairebones,relationships,1390845791.0,"In my opinion your fiancé is right. Your dad has made it clear, at multiple points, that he does not like your fiancé - I do not think a phone call would change this. He clearly doesn't respect him or approve of him. You are asking your fiance to phone someone who is going to insult him, and at the end is very unlikely to turn around and say 'Okay now I like him and you can get married'. It think it's important to think of it that way - your dad is not going to like your fiance after one phonecall, you know this. 

What is your fiancé even supposed to say? ""I'm sorry that you think I'm a despicable piece of trash?"" Is that likely to solve the issue or make your dad apologise?  It's not really fair on your fiancé, the only thing he did 'wrong' was live with you, and it was your choice to lie to your parents about that.

dunnoyabassa,relationship_advice,1390845799.0,"this being your first love, you're right that she will always have an important place in your heart.  however, my first two serious relationships required what i call ""the second flush.""  the relationships ended because they needed to, but the attachment to one another got us back together briefly before we painfully, ultimately ended things for good.

on the one hand, all relationships need work, attention and mindfulness to be sustained.  when you sign up for a lifetime with someone, the passion will die down and eventually you'll have to put more effort into making it work.  on the other hand, you are very young and have only one relationship under your belt.  learning from past failed relationships is how we find and build the ones that truly are worth keeping.

as i know nothing about you beyond what you've included in this post, it's very hard for me to say for sure what i think you should do (particularly since your relationship seemed to end just because you weren't really feeling it anymore).  consider the following:  if you got back together with her, and the exact same cycle of disinterest played out (and honestly, when you do the break up get back together thing that cycle usually speeds up a lot quicker the second time around) would you fight desperately to make it work or would you break up with her again?  if you try your hardest to be the perfect boyfriend and find you're still not feeling it will it still have been worth it to be with her?  is this woman the only person on earth who makes the world make sense or does this woman just happen to be the only one you've loved so far?

the fact that you have reservations about immediately going back to her makes me suspect it's time to move on.  by my read you're a normal young guy getting out of his first great relationship and you miss the love and security and you miss a great friend (after all, good romantic relationships are great friendships too). the fact that you had a 3 year relationship out of high school makes me suspect you are the type to love romantic relationships themselves, so it's normal that you'd yearn for such a thing when you've lost it.

your break up is very fresh, so it's normal that this should be a painful time even if she wasn't ""the one.""  attempting to help your pain by giving this woman false pretenses is unfair.  you've already acted upon serious doubts about your relationship.  you can ignore those doubts now to get back the thing it was scary to lose, but that won't make the doubts go away.  you WILL be able to love another woman and if you're so uncertain about your feelings in this relationship, it's extremely likely you WILL be able to love another woman MORE than this one someday."

chrunchy,canada,1390845926.0,"It depends on the complexity of the process that you're automating. If you have high skilled labour doing various jobs then a simple machine may not be able to replace your worker.

Take a woodworker for example. If your factory is making flat-panel ikea style knock-down furniture then you would be crazy to have $25/hour woodworkers sitting there drilling boards all day. In that situation, you can replace those workers with a CNC (computerized numerical control) robotic drilling station. The task at hand is extremely simplified - drilling holes in patterns. This would yield a high productivity and efficiency improvement in your manufacturing.

Now take a high-end custom furniture shop. With the same workers, you're producing furniture with sliding blind dovetails, split tenons, half-lap joints - highly skilled operations and you're not producing them in a high enough quantity to justify automation. If you happened to have a more standard product maybe you could have a high enough volume to automate, but the machinery to do that automation is much more complex and thus much more expensive."

I know some people are saying it's not adequate but honestly: what other language program is there? Duolingo doesn't have Svenska and the other options I've explored are intense rule learning and vocabulary memorization which you're reading and translating from your native language–*you're also not hearing the language spoken*, nor are you getting to speak it either. 

Rosetta Stone isn't meant to be the *only* option to learn your language. I'm using Rosetta Stone while trying to watch and listen to music, movies, TV, in swedish while looking for basic news articles to read as well. It also helps to have a friend who can speak Swedish that you can interact with, or a pen pal, someone or a group of people to share learning with. It makes all the difference. 

There is no silver bullet to learning any language, people will always tell you what's the best,  but the key no matter what, is to use it as much as possible. That's how you'll learn. "

As you put it here, it doesn't sound unusual if you two live together. If my SO was working late, knowing that there's a good reason he won't be home when you expect him and when he will be is normal. If I expect him home at 6, and he won't be there until 9, it's reasonable that you'd ask for a quick head's up phone call. 

But then you say: 

&gt; has been calling every night from work

Nightly check-ins are not reasonable. If he works late every night, then just assume he's working late. Now, if he's going out with friends, then I think again, it's reasonable to give you a head's up that he won't be home when you would normally expect him and where he'll be.

I suggest you stop with the working late check-ins, and just ask him to give you a quick courtesy notice whenever his schedule varies enough that you might be worried if he doesn't come home. 

Now, the fact that you're doing these to ""build trust"" and not to keep each other aware of changes in each other's schedules is... concerning. Check ins will not build trust. Work on the relationship if that's what you want. "

bleeker_street,Advice,1390846148.0,"I don't think I can help you on the masturbation front, however, I can tell you that your genitals is a dangerous place to have an open wound.  

I would strongly urge you to see a doctor.  

However, since many people refuse to do that for many reasons, I would say you need to go out a get a good antiseptic soap from a pharmacy/chemist/drug store.  You should wash the wound with warm soapy water and use a gentle regular soap like ivory.  Then you should wash your entire nether regions (butt crack, anus, cheeks, taint, upper penis shaft, pubic hair, pubic mound, and balls with the anti-septic soap to try to clean the general area.  After your shower pat dry with a fresh clean towel.  Apply a cream like polysporin to the sore and wrap with fresh gauze. 

When wrapping with gauze make sure you pull the foreskin taut.  The reason is because you don't want the foreskin so get stuck to the head of penis, and definitely don't want to accidentally heal to the head of penis which can happen and would require surgery to fix. 
Repeat daily, and wash your hands constantly before and after touching it.  There's no way to make this heal faster, you can only prevent it from getting worse. 

That said, go see a doctor.  And next time, masturbate a bit less, and invest in a high quality lube.  "

The father himself was a bit quirky, but the kids learned how to be creative and how not to be selfish with so many people in the home. Most learned how to sing, or play instrumenmts, which has helped them in their adult life. Plus, with all those siblings, it's easy to find someone to talk to about anything. Plus, if someone at school is messing with you, there's a chance that a sibling will have your back. So on and so forth. My mom was 13th of 14 kids and there is probably a good 30 year gap between the oldest and youngest of the family. 

Honestly, I wish I had a more siblings (I am the oldest of two) so I could have things like this. A bigger family that only grows once you get married and whatnot."

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1390846171.0,"They way they say ""Jewish state"" is pretty transparently antisemetic. They insinuate that they think that jackbooted thugs stomp down your door (SHALOM MOTHERFUCKERS), check for signs of being a dirty Muslim, and then summarily execute you if you are.

Israel is a billion times more secular and inclusive than Palestine. Where, you know, Hamas will drag you behind a motorcycle gang until you die if they suspect you of working in Israel and with Israelis and going to a good school in Israel instead of languishing in angry poverty with them.

I think something like over 20% of Israel is Arab, and they all have full citizenship rights. Most surrounding Arab states can't hold a fucking democratic election without it being a clusterfuck of corruption. In the Middle East, Israel is a beacon of democracy, secularity, plurality, and all sorts of freedoms that pretty much no other country can claim to enjoy.

When it comes down to it, most if not all of the Middle East would probably deny you a shit ton of rights for being anything but Muslim and *actively* practicing anything but whatever their Grand Imam proclaims you must do. A bunch of Orthodox fucks in Israel might be racist assholes, but the laws of Israel and the heads of state don't endorse that sort of prejudice, and have instead chosen to codify religious freedom and pluralism.

Israel has a lot of problems. But a lack of pluralism, especially considering a clusterfuck the rest of the region is, is not really it. I mean, you could probably point to Turkey's or Egypt's tolerance of Christians as a similar regime, but that's pretty much it. Those countries are still way less pluralistic and stable than Israel, and that's not a good thing."
LinguistHere,paradoxplaza,1390846171.0,"Yes-- I thought it was weird that Paradox even called it Korea instead of Joseon, but then reflected on the fact that Joseon is synonymous with the Yi dynasty.

It's not in our name. We didn't all get together and sign off on it or vote to put it out there. It has nothing to do with any majority of women and it isn't any individual woman's responsibility to feel an obligation to take offense that some company is claiming you can get 'women' through the use of their product. Why do you think that women in general should feel responsible for something that they had no input in or control over and did not choose?

ZestfulShrimp,ontario,1390846411.0,"I think its fine.  I also happen to be a product of the OCSB. My mother taught in it then was a principal in the OCSB.  I also have my daughter enrolled in Senior Kindergarden and couldn't be happier with how she's doing. I will also be sending my son there too when he's ready.  

My wife went to public school though, and she was more adamant about sending our kids to Catholic School than I was.  When I was in school we hardly ever had teacher strikes or work to rule job actions that took whatever activities made school fun and put them on indefinite hold, whereas she experienced those all the time.  She also didn't like the values that she was taught in the public system and preferred what I got.

Also speaking with some of my wife's friends who have their kids in public school, a lot of them are regretting not putting them in the Catholic school.  When McGuinty pissed off the teacher's union for the last time, they teacher's went into full on work to rule mode.  The one horror story I remember is that a kid in junior kindergarden threw up and the teacher made him clean it up before sending him to the office to get picked up by his parents.  You can take this with a grain of salt though because I heard it from a hysterical mother.

When it comes to tax dollars being spent, from what I got from my mother when she was budgeting, around here the Catholic schools got about 1/4 of what a corresponding public school would get, but they were always able to stretch their budget further than what the public schools would do, which was always blowing their budget.

Regarding indoctrination, I'm proof positive that it doesn't work.  The last time I was in a church was for my son's baptism, and the next time will probably be for my daughter's first communion. I don't foresee any Sundays being spent in church for my family."

CosmoCola,personalfinance,1390846430.0,"I've run into two situations with which I would like to request some advice:

1. I need a new/used car, and as much as I want to avoid it, I might have to take out a loan to pay for this car since I only have $4000 in overall life savings - I don't want to use this money to pay for the car. I know I shouldn't get financing through the dealership, but I am not sure what the best place would be to go to. Bank? Credit union? Money shark?

2. As a result of personal stupidity (re: laziness and forgetfulness), I got delinquent status on one of my student loans. I have since paid off the amount I owed for the months I missed payment, but I still owe a good $3000. I know my credit score took a hit so would it be more advantageous for my credit score to pay it off slowly, by installments, or use my life savings to pay the loan off? Moreover, will this prevent me from getting a loan for my car?"

I would highly suggest teaching ""look at me"", it worked so well for us.

Also, walks!  I'm sure you realize the importance of regular exercise seeing that you have a dog already, but if you have forgotten what the puppy crazies were like, just thought I would remind you.  My big crazy boy is a sweet, calm, well behaved lovey when he has his regular walks.  Otherwise all that unreleased energy turns him into a nightmare.

No hate to the woman who had kids back to back, it was management's decision not to hire appropriate cover like a temp, but the final straw for me was when she came back and sabotaged my work so that she could keep her job. I wound up with six weeks of bed rest and then was unemployed three months because i mentally could not handle any more politics- my boss had taken her side because she thought mothers needed to be looking out for each other. 

What helped me get my drive back was changing career tracks- i moved out of paralegal work and out of law firms and into corporate IT purchasing. It is very hard now for people with political agendas to try to say I did or did not do my job because my job is now obvious: people either have functioning computer equipment or they don't. No more people going in and doctoring word documents to say i didn't write them or hiding court judgments then complaining i lost them like the ""mommy"" tried to do to me with the tacit approval of my boss.

It took me years to get over it, and i still am not as motivated as I used to be, it is funny how busting your butt and then getting a knife in your back just kills motivation. I work smarter now, i trust people less and cover my butt more. I also have a boss and colleagues who have a real work ethic, and that helps too."

As far as improving it goes, the biggest contributor is holy sites with a whopping 10% each. Alternatively, you can join every single holy war and conquest you can, you cannot afford to lose any. Also raiding temples increases your authority. Rome is a very good place to raid, both for this and for the insane cash. The problem is that pagan rulers are vulnerable to christian missionaries, especially as the game goes on. I think it's around the 1000 mark or so that the AI converts much easier. What this means is that you soon will be or already are drowning in the moral authority hit for rulers being converted away from Norse

Other than that, you will have to get the holy sites somehow. The most realistic way is probably to raid enough to afford a ton of mercenaries and crush their troops.

3.) Depending on where it was stored (garage vs. outside under cover), check all electrical pathways for corrosion and/or other damage (cracking, shorting, rodent chew marks)

4.) While you're doing electrical checks, pull the spark plugs and shine a light in the cylinders to see if there is corrosion on the walls. This would be a good time to replace the spark plugs.

I refer to this as the ""shotgun"" method, trying a plethora of solutions in the hopes of finding the problem. After you get it idling consistently, do general lubrication, check the chain for damage, make sure the tires and brakes are functioning well.

If, after several months of processing, you decide you do want children, then there are ways of seriously reducing or mitigating the cost. 

It sounds to me like you're unhappy with more than just probably not having children, you don't seem passionate about nursing or living close to family.  I think these are things you'll want to think of too. 

Also, find out how big that probably is, because I know couples that were told that it wasn't likely that they'd have kids, and then they stopped using protection and suddenly - baby.  If you move to an apartment or decide that going childless is right for you then finding out you're pregnant will be a huge shock.

In a shooter like Lanza's case, even making all guns illegal would not have made a difference in a stolen gun case. The solution to these tragedies is not to blame the weapon used--McVey used a bomb, as did the unabomber, and other attacks have been committed with knives, swords, and less conventional weapons.

the two of you aren't together, so i'm confused about what she feels she can't commit to and what you feel you are wasting your time on.  if this is a casual hookup situation you should be free to go about your everyday life and have no expectations of her to be included in it.  if she's free to bang, cool.  if she's not, cool.

it sounds like you have a human cliche on your hands, and it also sounds like neither of you really do the casual hookup thing very successfully (i sure don't, which is why i stick to realtionships).  it sounds like you've found a cute girl with family issues and low self esteem who tries to love herself by feeling attractive and desirable to men by sleeping with them when she's not really emotionally prepared to do so.  she will probably use you as a self-esteem dispenser and she will probably multiply the drama in your life tenfold until she ""is just so stressed she can't even handle this right now,"" or until she finds another self esteem dispenser she likes better.

More importantly, it causes the potential replies to many questions to be greatly reduced. A few examples of such questions:

 - How did you meet your partner?
 - What's your highest karma post?
 - Are there people who choose to do things they believe are evil?
 - What is something that you are afraid you will not do before you die?

Thinking more about it, I suppose the difference between a body tattoo and those other objects is that when we are done with them, we can give them away. Not so with a tattoo. Tools have to be put down eventually, but you can't put down a tattoo. Tattoo removal can be expensive and painful. This is why I think Buddhist tattoos aren't really practical, as opposed to henna, which is temporary (but I really wouldn't encourage non-desis to get henna unless they know more about it's significance than ""pretty swirls"").

This is related to making sure you're not just trying to show off. If you think you're getting too vain about your mala, you can leave it at home. You can't leave your arm at home if your Buddhist tattoo is a source of pride.

And having a tattoo would disqualify you from being an eligible candidate for monasticism in some areas should you want to do that later in life. So, there's that."

silverionmox,europe,1390847325.0,"&gt; Well, only if you ignore the plight of southern Europe

Southern Europe was in for a hard time anyway, due to the banking crisis. How would they be better off without the euro? By devaluing? Ha. Across-the-board price increase of imports, including energy an resources, gutting buying power of wages in favor of big owners with external bank accounts. Not to mention that there would be less of an economy to cut to start with.

&gt;and do not care about the fact that the whole of the Eurozone is heading towards Japan territory.

We're not quite as save-happy yet. But to some extent, that is inevitable, with or without Euro: the EU and Japan both are highly productive economies with a stabilizing and aging population. You just don't get 10% growth rates in that situation.

&gt;However, for those of us who do not think 30 % unemployment, 170 % debt, and depression is a good thing - then Europe is not working. It is only working if you ignore the facts.

Blaming everything that goes wrong on the Euro is not a fact, it's an assertion. You could just as well blame it on gay marriage, that would make about as much sense.

&gt;No, it is not the case. For example, internal devaluation which is what the south is suffering is not due to this. It is natural, it happens in currency unions and it is also Economics 101. The way to ease this is of course perment transfers.

You say that the current economic policy doesn't matter and then propose a policy change to address the problems. Make up your mind.

&gt;And, we should obviously throw out the ones who doesn't follow the rule, like Greece, Italy and Belgium, for starters. However, your precious Eurozone is doing nothing of that? How is that for a working currency? Why aren't you acting?

Because the EU really isn't that powerful and national interests still have a decisive influence in structures where it shouldn't.

&gt;And again, nothing of that is happening, nor is shared debt, nor deeper integration. And one need that for a working currency union. It isn't even in the pipeline. So again, it is like you have one currency union in your head, but there is another one in the reality.

Mostly because of the eurosceptic hypocrites that drag their feet all the way, complain about every tiny little detail without constructive alternatives, threaten to leave at any turn, exact exceptions and opt-outs for themselves and national vetoes wherever possible, demand instant perfection.... and when the enterprise still succeeds despite their obstruction, they're the first to seat themselves at the banquet and loudly demand their share of the benefits, proclaiming the success of their policies."

We print bar coded labels for the plants, and use them to manage plant counts and then batches of finished products. It all goes through MJFreeway at this time.  

Other technology, barcoded products, we prepackage all of our bud in vacuum sealed jars, and barcode that too.  Checkout is scanned computerized and tracked to the gram for state reporting.

For curing we use digital hygrometers to measure moisture content of the bud.  In the garden digital PPM, PH meters, and digital climate controls are used.  The electrical system to relay and time 80,000 watts worth of lights is pretty impressive too.

Just now the state is making us implement a retarded RFID plant tracking system.  It sucks badly because it was the state that paid a contractor to develop it.  Really, tech wise they are lame.

Pretty high tech security alarm and camera systems are in place too.  Can monitor cameras from a live monitor feed in my house as well as on my cell phone.

My thoughts:

* If the top two picks shake out like this, will we trade down to accrue more picks or will we attempt to move up to Jax's spot and grab Teddy? I think it all depends on what our DE situation is and how impressive Mack is at the combine. If we stay where we are, it's very likely Mack is the pick. I think it's also possible that he goes even higher than #8. I would really prefer Mosley here.

* Will the Rams add another receiver? I can definitely see them trading down, but I don't know if they'll pull the trigger on a WR, [according to comments from their GM.](http://walterfootball.com/draft2014rumorsteams.php)

* Will the Lions take another corner? You can never have too many good CBs in any division, let alone the NFC North, but I don't know if I see it. The article does mention a scheme change, though, which would necessitate the move.

* Su'a-Filo going #12 overall?

But ""writing something off as a business expense"" isn't as effective as most people seen to believe. In order to receive a reduction for business expenses they must total more than two percent if your gross income, then after that two percent the expenses essentially lower your income at a 1:1 ratio. So you make 50 grand a year. You spend $1200 a year on business expenses. The first 2 percent (1000) isn't deducted, and the last 200 is deducted from your gross income so you are taxed as if you made $49800 a year instead of $50000 which will save you money equal to your federal income tax bracket times that amount you had deducted from your gross.

If you don't think things like reproductive rights (abortion), domestic violence, maternity leave, equal pay, women's suffrage, sexual harassment, and sexual violence are valid tenets of feminism then I would agree that this sub deserves the rep it's been getting.

&gt;Claiming feminists and men's rights advocates are on the same side, is like claiming that communists and laissez-faire libertarians are on the same side.

So you're saying that you're not fighting for equality (IE: not favoring the mother over the father in paternal disputes), but fighting for domination then? Because that's the same thing that radfems are doing. If MRAs were fighting for equality they would be on the same side as feminists.

Or maybe the title ""feminist"" has gotten distorted beyond repair recently, or maybe various extremist/conservative men's rights advocates have mangled the term purposely... I don't know.


From the replies in this thread my perception is that conservative men have been fighting against regular feminism which in turn caused feminists to become more extreme which in turn drew in moderate men, so now both groups are essentially a big mess mixed with both rational and extremist individuals."

katielady125,MakeupAddiction,1390847562.0,"I think you are right in a way. We do use makeup as a means of communicating with others that we feel beautiful, and empowered and confident. We are using our makeup to send a message. We also wear it as a form of art and personal expression, and art is meant to be viewed by other people. I mean if makeup was ONLY for ourselves why would be even bother sharing it on this sub-reddit? We'd apply it at home in secret and then wipe it off before ever going out. 

The real point is we get to choose how we present ourselves to the world and makeup is one of the tools that helps us do that. We get to design how we look, and craft the message we want to send to others with our makeup. It is for the benefit of the people around us that we send that message, and just like any other artist we are happy when people appreciate our work and understand our message, however we should never feel the need to change our message because someone else doesn't like it. You wouldn't tell Da-Vinci he needs to just go ahead and re-paint the Mona Lisa because you didn't like it. That is how I feel about makeup. This is MY art and MY message that I'm sharing with you. You don't have to like it, but you have no right to shame me for it if you don't. "

If she is not ready to trust you like that maybe you guys need to spend some more time just the way you are.

One of my submissive ""playmates""/friends just this last weekend turned into my full on slave girl. She wasn't ready for full on D/S when we first met, she had a really rough time in a past relationship as was deathly afraid of that sort of deep submission. I gave it time because I knew what was deep inside of her, now here I am training a Kajira from the ground up.

Your sub may never be ready for it,she may be ready in a week, a month, a year. Have patience and you will get there. It may do good to talk to other people who are/have been involved in 24/7 relationships too but in the end it boils down to you and your girl.

Hexaceton,AskReddit,1390847691.0,"This very much depents on your, or better her insurance. It depends on the exact package of insurance. Usually you pay a (low) percentage of about 5-10 percent, and the rest will be covered. If your grandmother chose to pay larger amounts per month/year/whatever towards the insurance, so had a more expensive package, the deductible will be lower, and the maximum ammount the insurance will pay higher. 

Now it also depents on your countries laws. Possibly the government would pay in case of a longer coma. 

I should add, though, that it is VERY unlikely to have an insurance pay for that long. Unless you got the needed cash to transfer your relative to a private hospital or institution, they will most likely turn off the life running machines after a certain amount of time. Here again this depends on your laws, if this is allowed/after which time. I guess, a year is the very maximum a coma would be 'tolerated'. 

If you want to know it exactly, go on your insurance's website, the should provide such informations there. Hope it helped ;) cheers

Spock's Beard and Dream Theater are barely progressive at all. Transatlantic pretends to live in the 70s and they are just re-doing what the ancestors of prog did, the same way, just give a listen to their millionth cover of a prog classic from the 70s.

See, everything originates to those years. It is a prog musician's duty to try something new and mark the beginning of an era. If it isn't done regularly, it's not progressive rock. That's why we have to have bands that will keep the creativity high, try new things and show that ""not everything is already done"". That's what actually motivates the musicians.

The other suggestion I have is start open handing crimps, meaning don't lock your thumb down on tiny holds next to your fingers, just let it hang off the hold. It may not provide as much power, but you'll build extra technique, and be able to tell better when to back off the pressure. That's also in my mind how to best get better, use the smallest amount of force to get through a move, I still do easy climbs with as little energy as possible to train.

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1390847777.0,"I have a very different view from the currently popular views expressed on this topic so far.

My personal experience has left me with not much choice but to value superficial as well as close friends (""true friends""). From childhood onwards, I've moved from country to country, city to city, and socioeconomic class to class.

""True friends"" in that situation starts to become as rare as the mystical ""unicorn"". TRP talks about how there is no such thing as unconditional love except possibly between close family (and I start to doubt even that). I apply this to everyone, not just women.

Everyone has a limit to what they personally can tolerate. People will change their perception of you based on what you can provide to them on an emotional level and what they need to invest into the friendship. Costs and benefits are always involved.

For me, the distance, cultural, and economic gap was clearly too much for a lot of close friendships. Those friends ended up just being superficial friends whom I see once in a blue moon when I drop by the town for business or leisure. The popular sentiment is that true friendship lasts forever, but if we're being honest, I don't even know some of those close friends anymore. There's just too many people to keep track of and not enough time. I can't be the one constantly keeping up to date with their lives, and they clearly don't care enough for mine.

That being said, superficial friends are good to have. Without delving into the metaphysical value of ""superficial friendships"", they still have practical value. The main difference to me between superficial and ""true"" friends is that the transactional nature of friendships is just more apparent when we remove the sentimentality (sunk costs, loyalty, honor, and other feelings). Without that sentimental buffer, we tolerate less bullshit from each other.

Once we realize that, it's easy to maintain them and get mutual benefits from them. When I am on a trip to a town I haven't been to in a while, I check to see who is there, and plan a visit that coincides with their schedule, so it doesn't go out of their way. I avoid contentious topics, and dress for the occasion. When there's no point of conflict, and less investment on their part (in time). We share experiences. Possibly build new useful connections. If they look favorably on you (demonstrate body of knowledge, show strong character, are an overall ""good"" person), you can get anything from business offers, new connections, investments,… to drugs. (I don't do drugs, I just find it funny how quick people open up to you even on illegal matters when you demonstrate that you aren't quick to judge/condemn.) 

The business world is full of these superficial relationships. There's no clear boundary between the business world and the rest of the world.

Yes, a lot of people do dishonorable things or have bad behaviours. But, as this sub espouses often, ""Lead by example"". I avoid judging and proselytizing, as I've found it doesn't change most people.

You move in with your kid, but you can't always remember her name, you can barely eat, and even tv shows don't make any fucking sense.

The tip of your femur is sheared off, but they can't operate because you're too far gone.

Celidos,relationship_advice,1390847825.0,"You are not in an emotionally abusive relationship. What you do have, however, are two separate people's needs not being met, and poor communication.

You two need to talk about how you show affection. There's a book recommended called the 5 languages of love, and if you don't already know how to self-analyze and figure out how you communicate love, it's a great way to start. 

You are physically affectionate. In your relationships, you place importance on touching and sex, kissing etc. That's how you understand love to be, and so that's what you look  for in others. However, you have to remember that everyone shows love differently. You are looking for what you do for love from someone else, instead of understanding how they show it.

What you are doing, is building up a lot of pressure on your wife. You still have a new baby, and that baby takes up a lot of her time. Have you tried picking up chores, making dinner, etc without the pressure of 'I'm doing this so you'll have sex with me'? Have you tried romancing her, seducing her, taking her out and being silly with her? It sounds like sex has almost become a mechanic for you since it's been so long, it's not something you do out of love or affection but you want it so bad because you feel like it's being denied to you in some manner. The more emphasis you put on it in your head, the more you think of it as denial, the worse off you will end up. 

Take sex off your mind for a month. Fap to your hearts content, but don't pressure your wife for sex. Kiss her forhead, help with the chores, take her out, seduce her. Romance her, without all the pressure of physicality. I guarantee you that this is the first start to a very big change in your relationship dynamics."

Personally, now that I've taken the Red Pill, I find it a lot harder to associate with certain friends of mine. I can see the world better than they can, and make more accurate predictions about the kinds of things that will happen. What used to feel like even-keeled interactions now feels like manipulation on my part, as I steer my friends in the direction I want them to go so that I get the result I want.

While I don't really have a problem with this, it was a surreal rite of initiation. It just feels weird - moving someone like a game piece when you've spent almost your entire life thinking of them as a peer. It really emphasizes the compartmental mindset you need to have in order to make effective use of Red Pill strategies.

**Act as a player, but behave like a piece.**

Now when I make new friends, I begin testing them out for receptiveness to the Red Pill mentality. If I think they have the potential to wake up, I introduce a slow IV of truth into their daily lives. If they're too plugged in, I'll participate in keeping the illusions real so that Agents don't target my ass.

Why? I wasn't cheating on anyone, I wasn't breaking any laws, and I wasn't forcing anyone to do anything they didn't want. By limiting my choices based on what I thought her obligations should be I would have been imposing my own social or moral values on her. Forcing someone else to live by your own personal values is controlling. Not only that, it is insulting because it shows that you think that your values are more important than theirs and she is less than you. I didn't want someone to manage, I wanted a partner. In order to get that you have to accept that they are responsible for their own moral dilemmas and not force your value judgements on them.

It would be like me telling you that I don't want you to eat ice cream because I think it's bad. And then telling you that you were a bad person for eating ice cream because you knew I thought it was bad.

Also, you keep bringing up the word ""psychopath"", I don't think it means what you think it means. A psychopath can't  empathize with others and uses others for their own benefit. I can assure you, I am plenty empathetic, just not with you because from the start your sole purpose seems to have been to make me feel bad because my actions don't align with your values, and frankly, I don't care about some stranger on the internet who just wants me to feel bad. I got over that a long time ago.

Of the two of us, I would say your point of view is more destructive. You would have people who are unhappy in their current relationship but afraid to leave it be forced to stay in their relationships by social disapproval, while I would encourage them to seek a relationship where they can be truly happy."

Eeeeeeeeeeh, if you're flying, sure.  If you're driving?  Depends on how big your vehicle is, and how poofy the dress is.

I agree with this; most brides have 2 or more fittings (first and final, at least), so that's at least 3 trips you'd have to make to your home town before the wedding.  Do you plan on going out there for other wedding-related planning?  For birthdays or family events?"

terp02andrew,overclocking,1390848015.0,"1) Set your VID to ""Auto"" and reboot. I'm curious what value it pulls.

It's not a solid indicator by any means, but if it's more than mine (1.05), then it may not be smooth sailing haha. That said, even the worst chips should be hitting 4.4-4.5GHz. 

2) You need to be VERY careful scaling your vcore like that. VRIN **must** outpace vcore on the Haswell platform. This is because VRIN/VCCIN/Input Voltage supplies voltage to the [*entire* chip](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/2). There's a reason I don't like when non-Haswell users try to help on situations like this. Many also misunderstand that LLC is stabilizing the input voltage, and not vcore (as it used to in the past).

&gt; The other big part of the Haswell power story is what Intel is calling FIVR: Haswell’s Fully Integrated Voltage Regulator. Through a combination of on-die and on-package circuitry (mostly inductors on-package), Haswell assumes responsibility of distributing voltages to individual blocks and controllers (e.g. PCIe controller, memory controller, processor graphics, etc...). With FIVR, it’s easy to implement tons of voltage rails - which is why Intel doubled the number of internal voltage rails. With more independent voltage rails, there’s more fine grained control over the power delivered to various blocks of Haswell.

&gt;Thanks to a relatively high input voltage (on the order of 1.8V), it’s possible to generate quite a bit of current on-package and efficiently distribute power to all areas of the chip. Voltage ramps are 5 - 10x quicker with FIVR than with a traditional on-board voltage regulator implementation.

Anything above 1.2vcore tends to necessitate raising Input Voltage. To raise vcore *without* raising Input Voltage means you'll be constantly raising vcore while not gaining **any** stability. There's not a hard rule for the 'gap' between vcore and Input voltage either.

Lower vcores it could only be say 0.5, higher vcores you may be looking closer to 0.6 or 0.7. This varies between chip-to-chip. If you want to be conservative though, you can just do say 1.5x of the vcore, and then round up to the next 0.05v increment.

So yeah, if you're coming from SB, this may be a rude awakening :p

**Some additional tips:**
To eliminate other variables do the following:

* Don't overclock your RAM just yet *and* manually set to relaxed timings for the time being.

* If you are using 4 DIMMs instead of 2 DIMMs, you may want to try OCing only with 2 DIMMs for the time being. This isn't like Core2/Lynnfield/Bloomfield where jacking the NB/QPI/VTT a bit and you could call it a day haha. It just seems there's not a consistent consensus on what stabilizes 4 DIMMs. Some do well, others don't. So for the time being, let's eliminate it as a factor.

* Manually set your Uncore/Cache to a non-Turbo multiplier. Set your Uncore voltage slightly above stock (I use 1.15v for example)

Again, I would take the time to read DarkWizzie's first post thoroughly, and come back if you have additional questions."

atrain728,dogs,1390848030.0,"Owner of the most allergic dog ever here: The scratching can be caused by anything, but once you've got ""wounds"" you've got infections. Usually this takes antibiotics to clear up. Sometimes it can be done with topical treatments, but usually a course of simplicef works for our dog. This often times comes with a course of Pred.

Naturally, antibiotics and steroids are to be used sparingly. We give our dog a daily dose of Claritin and monthly allergy shots to deal with his issues, but still needs treatment a few times a year - usually at least one or two in the fall.

TL;DR If he's itched himself raw, it's likely infected and you should consult a vet."

silverionmox,changemyview,1390848050.0,"&gt; People often accuse feminists of this, baselessly. Not that you have, but I find your argument similarly flawed. Fighting racism does not just mean siding with minority races in every single situation. It means promoting racial equality. I don't see that as zero-sum.

You don't just want to lift up disenfranchised groups. You think you inevitably need to bring down others to lift them up. That's zero-sum thinking.

&gt;If the market were 15% brown band-aids, cool. It's not. More importantly, my point is that white is seen as ""normal"". Or default. A black person having to use pink bandaids (as most do) is just one more reminder that they are not the target audience. That the market does not care about their wishes. 

Then start up a company making band-aids in all shades of brown. It's not high-tech, so it can't be prohibitively expensive.

&gt; But black people notice, all right. It's inescapable. Take a week and try to notice ads, products, messages, and entertainment that assumes that you are white. It's... most of it. And not only because white people remain the plurality in the US.

So whites should whine because NBA and rap music don't have enough whites? How childish is that? Why do they define themselves by their skin color? Isn't it time to put that behind us?

By seeing that as a problem, you are reinforcing and practicing racist groupthink. You see it in a them vs. us frame of mind. And you can only solve that by zero-sum policies.

We must grow above that. Group interests are all nice and well to detect potential problems, but if you make it the centerpiece of policy, people will never be able to see themselves as anything but members of those groups."
Zeppelanoid,slowcooking,1390848052.0,"So a few days ago, I made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/1vy1tt/terrible_quality_photo_snow_day_yesterday_so_i/). Much like the buffalo chicken, this stew was a happy accident. I *wanted* to make creamy chicken with potatoes, but I added way too much water. So I had stew. And it was lovely. I seriously need to stop adding so much liquid when I slow cook. I'll get the hang of it soon enough!

Ingredients: 

- Two skinless boneless chicken breasts

- One potato, peeled and cubed

- One can of cream of celery soup

- One can full of water (to repeat: this was too much water)

Directions:

Put everything in slow cooker, mix well. Cook on low for 5-6 hours. Well...at least that's what I did. I got inpatient. The potatoes were cooked well but not ""fall apart"" cooked. Next time, I'll put this on earlier and cook it for 8-10 hours. Maybe."

stinatown,AskWomen,1390848148.0,"""Treat me like one of the guys"" is really shorthand for ""don't treat me like a girl you're interested in,"" I think. 

My best friend is a guy, and he has a lot of great guy friends who I've met. Sometimes I meet one of them and I know, from the stories I've heard, that he's a cool person with varied interests. I'm excited to meet him, and then he talks to me like we're stuck on an elevator for a few floors. He has on his best manners and sticks to safe topics. 

And that's great, if we're coworkers or on a first date. But if you're at my party, or we're at a bar together, I want to meet the real you. I want to see you reenacting your favorite movie scene and telling me that embarassing story and defending that band that I'm not crazy about. I want to meet the person that my friend knows. 

I don't want to be insulted. I don't know if that's a guy thing because you're all trying to alpha-male each other, but the fact is that I don't want to hear if you think I'm too tall/short/fat/skinny. If you want to rag on me, pick something original--how I have told the same story 15 times or that my new, hipster-style glasses make me look like I'm doing Daria cosplay--and I'll laugh and dish it right back. When I joke with people, I try to pick something that they've done on purpose and they're not ashamed of. So I don't pick on my super-bro coworker for being short, but I might tease him about how he's only excited for his paycheck because he needs to get some more neon tanktops for his next EDM festival.

abeyante,OkCupid,1390848343.0,"I just want to say that ""The Spark"" isn't all that common, so I don't think there's anything ""wrong"" with you, so to speak. To pull some numbers out of my ass, I'd estimate that of every 30 or 40 men I meet, I'll have The Spark with maybe 1 of them.

I can find someone attractive and get along with them without experiencing The Spark. A good example is one of my best male friends. I had a crush on him briefly high school, since he's cute and a really great person. But we've never had The Spark and, while we find each other attractive, there's never been that magical energy between us, you know? And I can have The Spark with someone I don't immediately find attractive. An example of *this* is an ex boyfriend of mine. When we first met, I honestly didn't think he was all that cute... But The Spark was there, between us, making me blush and stare at the floor when he approached me in the halls between classes in high school to talk to me. I was attracted *to* him even though he wasn't ""my type"" and I would never have called him hot. After we started dating I grew to find him attractive, and even now, years later, I think he's hot! Magic of The Spark, I guess. I also have an ex with whom I've never felt The Spark. He was attractive and interesting but I was never attracted *to* him. We were together for a long time because we got along so well but the sex was awful and we never, ever had The Spark.

It's basically that chemical thing that differentiates pretty, interesting people from pretty, interesting people you want to mate with. Hell, I have a ""FWB"" type person with whom I've never felt any sort of spark, but we get along great and occasionally have sex. Friendly sex, you know? Fun, but not romantic or emotional.

Basically, what I mean to say is that you won't have that spark with every girl you get along with, even if they find you attractive and you find them attractive. In my experience, ""The Spark"" is always mutual, so I think your biggest problem is that, from your wording, you seem to be focused on trying to find a girl who feels that Spark with you. Really, dude, you need to be looking for a girl with whom YOU feel that Spark! You'll know it when you find it. Focus on your feelings and what you want out of a relationship."

Animals who learn that food can come from people can pose a risk to themselves and to people. They lose their fear of humans which is dangerous. They can spread disease, attack people, and are much more likely to get hit by cars. If animals come to populated areas in search of food the DEC will kill them in many cases. (There was recently a case like this in the Adirondacks of NY where a woman was occasionally feeding a bear) Finally in most states it's illegal.

If you're going to feed song birds and squirrels use a feeder. NEVER feed any other wild animal. You're doing way more harm than good. It's not a ""treat."" The hunters you're referring to probably don't think you're a pussy, they probably think you're doing harm to the deer population. Believe it or not, most hunters are conservationists.

ILovePlaterpuss,leagueoflegends,1390848617.0,"Pick Fase: by Carl Chickens.

Having settled that I would first go to grab the Blue Buff, my mind was much disturbed by indecision whether or not to take Mundo. It was tempting to think of that expensive Madman publicly airing his shose in the archway of the Blue Buff's camp-yard; it was almost solemn to imagine him casually produced in the labs of Zaun, and confounding the disfunctional senses of jungle lee. On the other hand, the blind monk might worm himself into his lane and burn his ghost; or, reckless and desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might dive him deep under the tower. My mid-laner, too, might hear of him, and not approve of leaving him unbanned. On the whole, I resolved to leave the Mundo behind. 

.

At that time it was customary to carry bronzies that duoed down in the bottom lane. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers, and had more than once seen them on the front page, displaying their iron-league mechanics across the lane, I had no cause to be surprised when Heimer, meeting me at the dragon, came up and told me there were two carries going afk. But I had a reason that was an old reason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word ""carry"" from a bronze.

.

""I thought you seemed as if you didn't like them?""

""I can't pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don't particularly. But I don't mind them.""

""See! There they are,"" said Heimer, ""coming out of the brush. What a degraded and vile sight they are!""

They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a doran's shield with them, and all three came out mashing their hands on the keyboard.

If they change the day because of snow, it feels like the antithesis of one of the primary values that underpin sports (mental and physical toughness) for the comfort of the people wealthy enough to go the Superbowl in the first place.  We don't cancel games due to snow in the regular season. That gives lie to the fact that it's for safety.  We don't consider games played in snow less legitimate for any other rankings, records or relevance.  Why then would snow undermine the value of the superbowl itself.

It seems to me the real reason is that the NFL is worried about the live attendees who are by nature more affluent than your standard NFL fan sitting in the nosebleeds. They seem look at the Superbowl attendees differently, and that's annoying to the millions of fans who wish they could be there live themselves.  If the corporate guests don't want to sit in the snow, let them sell their tickets.  We don't need to change the whole date and time of the game for them."

Kaisharga,DnD,1390848777.0,"Actions have consequences. 

Read that again. Memorize it.

Now let's apply it.

**Stabbing people:** Most people don't like to get stabbed. It's downright frowned upon and discouraged, in fact. Local authorities get involved, people very quickly learn to stay away from someone with an itchy stabbing hand, all correspondence is by messengers (who throw the message from many yards away and then get the hell out of the area, if they can't afford a bow and arrow to tape the message to). Bullies pick fights with the stabber, and though they won't go for the kill (unless the stabber has attacked someone significant to the bully), they'll go for a broken arm, a stolen dagger, or an oath to submit (which, if broken, has its own Consequences).

**Kicking down doors:** Turns out that stealth has its perks. Monsters exist in rooms, right? And if the door doesn't break down with the first kick, the monsters have a round to set up an ambush situation. Kicking down the door is expedient, but it's not smart.

**Throwing objects into tripwires:** It works! Great! Now, you have to design better traps, because those traps are now boring. This one is your fault, not the player's, and the consequences are that People Who Want Their Stuff Protected will have their stuff stolen instead, and will A) be upset their stuff is stolen and want it back, and B) figure out better ways to make traps that require a little more finesse to navigate.

**Metagaming:** Is this a problem? Like, really; is having a little knowledge so unbalancing? What kinds of things does the character ""know"" that they shouldn't? Other people's conversations? That shouldn't be a problem unless your party is *trying* to keep secrets from this player. And hey, if this player has read the Monster Manual and knows what orcs are capable of to the letter, that's good! That means they should be better able to help the group apply some effective tactical strategies (and that therefore you'll be able to throw bigger, tougher baddies at them, which Difficult Player will find satisfying because it's a better, more interesting challenge--and worth more XP, to boot).

(If, on the other hand, your party *is* trying to keep secrets from your Stabbyguy, that's a problem meriting of special attention--if the other players were trying to keep secrets from me, I'd be pretty upset too and would probably do some dumb stuff just to make it fun for me.)

**Stealing the spotlight:** This character has given you an uncanny backstory. *This is awesome.* This means you can tie this character into the party's ongoing dealings, and take threads from this backstory and weave it into a tale of intrigue and treasure and power. Has anyone else given you a backstory that's sufficiently interesting that you remember it at all? Make them somehow tied together down the line, and use that to weave a story unique to this party. If he wants the spotlight, and he's given you a special hook, take it and reel the party in with it. This is useful! This is good! We as DMs love it when the players let us make *them* the story! You have a fantastic resource here, and ""evil bakers"" is a concept that absolutely *begs* to have the question ""why?"" asked of it. So have fun!"

Notice how Earl looks like Troy Polamalu up near the LOS (making plays being the deepest of any safety in the game at 7 yards deeper than the avg FS safety) and is making plays near the LOS that's because he doesn't account for Sherman as much any more. You'll rarely see earl make a play in sherman's zone. But he'll routinely make tackles on the left side where Maxy is or where Browner is even though that's not in his zone.

Ashihna,MapPorn,1390848849.0,"Was it really a Genocide? Decide yourself:

*1: Armenians lived for circa 600 years in Turkey, under turkish rule peacefully. They dominated the arts and crafts jobs and had a well endowed lifestyle. The paid their taxes like every good citizen and everybody was content.

*2: Enter French revolution; Minorities stir in every empire around the world for independence, Armeniens not excluded. But they do not act on it like the greeks did. That means no big uprising. There are discussions among them though.

*3: First world war: Ottoman empire fights on many fronts. Most of the men(that means every healthy men above the age 16) are away from their homes fighting a war with small hope to win. Non-muslims are not enlisted in the army, so Armenian men are at home with unprotected turkish(and kurdish) women and children around them. Allies promise Armenians that they get their own country if they rebel against Ottomans. Not before long, they decide that it is the best time to do just this in the eastern provinces of Turkey. For this purpose they rebel against Ottoman empire and kill many Turks along the way. Ottomans send some troops which they can spare from the big war. There is a battle between them, many Turks and Armenians die. But the Turks prevail. Enver Pasha sends telegrams to the eastern provinces that the Armenians are to be driven to exile to Syria. So the big march begins.

*4: The war on the eastern front is lost. Turkish men in the eastern provinces return to their villages and find them destroyed. In some villages, even the dogs are not spared. The soldiers and relatives of the people who are killed by the Armenians(especially the tribal Kurds) massacre many Armenians who are on their way to Syria as a revenge.

The history gets written by the winning party. The victors of the 1. world war were the allies. Armenians were on their side at that time, rebelling against the already weakened Turkey. So what the Turks call a regretful forced exile of a backstabbing minority, is written as the genocide of 1.5 million Armenians.

The Armenian diaspora advocates this ever since while Turkey, a young republic who had more urgent matters than answering these claims, neglects to tell their side of the story and here we are.

Undoubtedly, there were many Armenians killed. But for crying out loud; it was the first world war. Then again, it is truly a tragedy and a black mark on Turkish history. But was it a genocide? Decide yourself!

NapalmITM,TeraOnline,1390848938.0,"This isn't exactly a good mindset to have for two reasons:

First, Sorcs and Archers base crit isn't all that different from Zerkers, Slayers or Warriors. The difference lies in other factors, like Warrior's Deadly Gamble and Assault Stance or Slayers having access to a half a dozen critical glyphs. Zerkers are in the same boat as ranged DPS as far as crit is concerned. You should offset by rolling crit chance on your weapon and/or your necklace, or using carving Zyrks (Archers only since Sorcs get a carving glyph for Void Pulse).

Second, access to the back of the boss is partly the responsibility of your tank. His only job is to put himself in a corner, hold aggro, and let the DPS have as much time on the boss's back as possible. Completely gimping your DPS output because you run with crummy tanks is not an acceptable reason to be dealing mediocre damage compared to the rest of your party. Besides that and as anecdotal as it is, I have no trouble landing back crits as an Archer in CW even with the boss turning around constantly.

As an aside, in any raid scenario there is almost always a Mystic present for the double crit aura."

Endorsing the locking up of our citizens so that you can stay in business is so far beyond wrong, I can't even get my head around it.

Regarding the impact on business.. Currently shops in Denver that are selling retail to consumers are getting close to $100 for 1/8 ounce. Once the novelty wears off and supply catches up with demand things will level out.  

The only reason that Marijuana is more expensive than tomatoes is because of the prohibition. When prohibition is over prices will continue to fall. $400/oz was common 3 years ago.  Now $175 is par.  I suspect in another 3 years $100 will be the leveling off point.

s54b32dd,bootroom,1390849050.0,"I think /u/hcdangerfield211 had the best advice I've seen yet; in these small 6v6 games you're at a distinct disadvantage when you're not on the ball because scoring happens so easily, and there's no time to recover from a mistake.

Your best bet is to stay in front of the player, don't commit, and make them pass or attempt to gain position on you. The nature of the small-sided game is that there are ample scoring opportunities; you have to trust your teammates to defend their marks, and make sure your first priority is always defending the shot, because you're not going to get a chance to make up for diving in, and there isn't as much of a safety net. I think you're attempting to defend in small-sided games with the same mentality as a full-sided defender, and that's just not realistic because a goal could come from just about anywhere in the offensive half. Your first priority is always your positioning/delaying the defender, second priority is blocking the shot, third priority is denying the pass, fourth priority is taking away possession. An errant pass or deflected shot is much more likely than a takeaway in the small sided game. The small sided game is great for teaching you that defensive discipline, because it really hammers you if you make mistakes."

My grandparents disowned my mother when she was dying when I was a baby. They didn't seem to realise and/or care that she was dying and the day after the funeral left for a holiday.

Its something I never quite forgave them for and they ignored me from when she died upwards. Until my grandfather was dying when I was 17 or so.

My grandmother wished to have me there and meet me, but treated me with nothing but contempt. I initially refused to go, but my step-mother (who I love to pieces) thought that I should meet this woman myself.

Both my step-mum and I regret going, I regret meeting her in every way possible, but I know at least know. My Dad, of course, knew exactly what she was like but told me I needed to see for myself, as most of my knowledge of her was second hand. 

OP it is up to you, meeting this woman might put your mind at rest to see who she is and what's she's like from your own perspective, rather than what its like now.

rick2g,Physics,1390849077.0,"That's missing the point - the computational scaling problem remains with D-Wave.  

You could solve a brute force problem (such as the traveling salesman problem) twice as fast with two processors as with one (assuming the problem set is small enough, anyway).  You could solve that same problem 4 times as fast with 4.  It scales *linearly*.  The D-Wave device *also* scales linearly - 4 qubits is only twice as powerful as 2 qubits, and so on.  So it doesn't really matter how much they improve the ""process development"" - it won't add computational power any faster than simply adding transistors would.  Aside from that, transistors are easy to scale, and are well-understood.  Qubits, on the other hand, get increasingly fragile as they're scaled.

The entire point of general quantum computation is that it would allow for processing power to grow exponentially with added qubits - thus allowing for rapid computations of problems (such as the traveling salesman problem) which grow way too fast as additional data is added to the problem - a TSP graph with 20 nodes (20! possibilities, or ~2.4 x 10^18 possibilities) is probably solvable with some powerful hardware and a lot of time/resources.  Comparably, a TSP graph with 40 nodes (40! or 8.2 x 10^47) would require so much computational time and power that it would take the combined and computationally idealized resources of the entire solar system billions of years to completely solve it.

That's what quantum computation could do - scale exponentially so that exponential and geometric problems such as the TSP could be tackled with reasonable time and reasonable resources.

And that's what D-Wave has repeatedly failed to do - I find it likely that they're doing some *very* interesting things, but true quantum computation does not appear to be one of those things.

 Konoha is the most facist villain in the whole series.  Even though Madara is stronger then any shinobi on the planet right now, Konoha is the true villain of the series.  But no, it's shonen so anything that comes from Konoha is good, no matter how many families they murder in their homes or how many children they experiment on, it's okay.  They are the heroes because Konoha is protagonists' home.

Itachi is a spy, a victim, immoral, but forgiven by Niisan because he fucked up Sasuke beyond repair (almost killing him TWICE) all to protect him.

Pain had the right idea, but was touched by the Protagonists name and relation to his own sensei, so he was defeated by plot morality.  At the same time, There are only 4 Akatsuki members that would have been decent world lords (Itachi, Konan, Nagato, and Kisame).

injoy,Reformed,1390849102.0,"Okay, let me explain that 1) I completely affirm complementarianism, 2) I have recommended this book so many times over the years that I've lost track, and 3) this book was in some ways a major building block of my own marriage, as pre-marriage my husband's and mine's discussion of roles in marriage essentially amounted to ""I agree with that Piper book!"" and ""I do too.""  I have referred back to it and my husband has referred back to it (a lot less ;)) over the years since.  I have read it cover-to-cover about four times and reread parts of it far more than that.  So I'm not slamming the book.

However, I also don't have at this point as optimistic of a view as yours. :)  The book is huge and detailed and one might presume it had all the answers to all the questions, but I haven't found it to be actually such a great foundation for marriage.  It is absolutely an adequate response to feminism, and it reiterates in numerous biblical ways, over and over again, how egalitarianism is wrong.  I appreciate that about it.  I appreciate that about the complementarian movement as a whole.

But.  The Bible has a LOT more to say about how Christians should treat each other than just the few verses on husbands and wives, and those verses apply to marriage as well.  Stuff like [Philippians 2:3] and [Proverbs 10:19] can be a lot more practical to marriage than Ephesians 5.  Or maybe they're just more difficult, might be a better way to say it!  Ephesians 5 is definitely an overarching principle--that I affirm strongly!--but what does it LOOK like in a Christian home?  I think we see in cultures all around us (especially historically) that men can be the indisputable leaders even in completely pagan societies.  What makes it different in Christian homes?  

RBMW has a consistent language of ""often"", ""not always"", ""sometimes"", etc., that just isn't biblical, in a prescriptive way, because there are actual principles *elsewhere* in Scripture that clarify that it isn't just a matter of frequency, but a matter of holiness, and that there are specific principles in Scripture that flesh out the details that they obscure with their language of degree and talk of ""general patterns.""  And I think (and have seen) that it leads to real trouble if a husband and wife are operating off the principle that ""the husband makes most of the decisions most of the time."" Scripture is not so wishy-washy!  It gives one the impression that so long as the husband is making the majority of the decisions, and graciously ceding one here and there to his wife, that the marriage is biblical.  And that's not true at all.  There's a whole bunch of absolutes that come into play, as you listed: the husband is always responsible, putting oneself first is always a sin, being prideful is always a sin, serving others is always good, pursuing holiness is always essential, laziness is always a sin, speaking always in love is essential, and so on.  In the heat of the moment both the husband and wife have to evaluate themselves and see if their actions are *holy* in the sight of God, not merely whether they've met their quota for leadership or are due for a exception.  Agree entirely with what you said, ""not to split the difference, but to be an entirely different sort.""  And agree about Christ.  But I don't think the book is quite there with you.  I think the authors would agree, but the book overall I think is pretty reflective of this list, which has way too many words that lead one to think it's a matter of ""balance"" between being a pansy or being a tyrant, instead of a singular pursuit of being Christlike and holy.  It's like they're trying to build a house beginning with the roof."

nevertruly,AskWomen,1390849110.0,"Maybe you should? Advertisers use many things to try to sell their wares: the attention of men/women, the acquisition of wealth, the appearance of social status, higher abilities and competence. Women don't have anything to do with the fact that you are choosing to view advertising as representative of them and no obligation to care that you are doing so. I am able to watch a commercial and be aware that shampoo isn't going to make me orgasm, chocolate isn't going to make me sexy, drinking specific drinks isn't going to make me classy, and wearing certain clothes isn't going to net me the man of my dreams. That's because ads lie. They associate products with unrelated goals and emotions to convince you to buy things. That is on the people designing the ad and the people buying the products, not whatever fantasy they are selling you. You seem to be under the impression that women are complicit in some grand conspiracy with advertisers to link them with products which is laughably incorrect. Women as a group are not sitting around and going, ""oooh - let's make them all buy axe body spray by having sexy ladies on the commercial and then think in reality that that shit stinks and we don't like it"". Women as a group don't have anything to do with that. The makers of axe make those decisions. They have those conversations. They test those ads with focus groups of *men*, not women, to see how well they will help sell product. They don't care what women think about it. They only care that there are enough men who will positively associate their product with beautiful women and buy it. I don't see why you want to blame an advertising fantasy on all women everywhere.

It sounds like you're taking it well relatively, considering the worst-case scenarios she probably entertained were like, violence or instant disconnect. I applaud you for being thoughtful of her needs even while you're going through your own freak out. 

Relationships can survive transition, so if you do really love her, there's a chance it'll work out- but you're not obligated to stay either if it doesn't. If you can I'd ask your boyfriend if she could take you to talk to her gender therapist together. That may allow both of you to alleviate concerns, and give you someone to talk to who can answer your questions and fears about her transition (including the medical process of transition, and myths about the effects of hormone therapy) in a less personally tied way.


Breathe. It's going to be okay. One outcome: You may be straight but have an exception because the man of your dreams will still be the woman of your dreams when she can express who she is, if you remain attracted to her. You may not be able to keep this relationship the way it is, but you'll be alright and move on to someone else if it works out that way.

Had they said, ""To see the doctor and get some medicine"" then I would probably have obliged more often.

Apparently it was extremely hard for him to get a job. Growing up in Cali, he was always outside in board shorts. In Cambodia his complexion was associated with a field worker. The upper class families would chase him out of their homes or beat him with brooms even if he showed them his US passport. Many times he would be replaced with a non-native English speaker, and someone who obviously is not fluent in Khmer (he knew because they were placed with the same placement agency).

You say you are introverted, and so am I, but I have a love for and a quality of theatricality that helps me enjoy like-minded company.  My suggestions:  join a local theatre group- you don't have to be an actor, there are dozens of other jobs in putting on plays that are fun and rewarding.  And the age range, and the maturity level,  practically guarantees you'll find minds of similar development to your own. Besides, it's great fun!  

The same might be true of joining a choir, if you can sing and like music. Again, you don't have to stand out, it's a choir,  and the range of personalities is much more generally mature than you'd find among your peers.  Better chance to make a connection that satisfies.  

I hope this is helpful.

mrcleanup,relationship_advice,1390849500.0,"&gt; Maybe you'll understand when your gf cheats on you, just like she did on her previous bf.

My ex wife cheated on me, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I had been dedicated to her through a horrible marriage and that broke the last remaining ounce of trust I had, finally allowing me to reevaluate things and end it. She did me a favor by cheating, if she hadn't I would have been ""faithful"" forever no matter how miserable I was because I had made a promise.

&gt;You made your gf's bf unhappy

Again, I don't control other people's actions, I never met the guy. If anyone made him unhappy it was his girlfriend.

&gt;You both could have waited until she dumped him

Waited to do what, build a relationship of trust and mutual affection? You can't show someone that you appreciate them unless they are single? I pity your girlfriends, I hate to break it to you, but no one person can be everything someone else needs, they will need other people to talk to, confide in, and receive appreciation from.

I know you are convinced that you are right... but [here's someone on reddit right now](http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1w9zxi/i_almost_cheated_on_my_boyfriend_and_i_regret_not/) who needs exactly what I had to offer, compassionate, attentive companionship to show they they are a valuable person with other options so that she can gather the courage to break it off and try and find some happiness for herself. Do you really believe she should just suffer because no one else should be able to get to know her and make her feel appreciated as a person because she already has a boyfriend?"

Honestly though you two are not as compatible as you think you are.

If you end up married and decide to have children against what he really wants, will he end up resenting you for ""stealing"" the dual-income no kids lifestyle he was likely looking forward to? You and him should probably talk this over some more and both of you should think about where your priorities lie.

SirNuke,NetflixBestOf,1390849605.0,"imdb says:

&gt; In a 2013 television interview (shorty [sic] before receiving the AFI Lifetime Achievement Award) Mel Brooks stated that he personally obtained George Lucas' full permission to parody any and all things Star Wars related. But, on one condition: that absolutely no merchandise of any kind be produced from the film. This is the reason why all Yogurt and the dinks do is merchandising (it's also why none of the merchandise seen is the film was ever mass produced or publicly sold in any way).

Which sounds a lot more realistic.  Mel Brooks didn't need his permission per se, but it helps knowing that he isn't going to be butting heads with Lucas while making the film.  Similar to Weird Al's reasoning for getting permission even though he technically doesn't have to.

Funny enough, I imagine merchandising wouldn't be necessarily protected compared to the movie itself.  Also, Lucas was probably guessing that Spaceballs merchandise could potentially cut into his sweet, sweet Star Wars merchandise revenue stream."

keakealani,piano,1390849705.0,"Just to throw out another perspective - video game and film music is very heavily based on both harmonic and structural ideas, as opposed to melodic composition. In essence, you're creating ""background music"" which means you have to be intimately familiar with the subtle harmonic and structural cues you can use to tell a story while not detracting from the main action of the plot or relying heavily on specific time sequence (since video game music tends to loop during a course/level/cutscene/etc.) If you haven't already, developing a strong theoretical background in harmony and structure, with particular emphasis on compositional technique, would be crucial to composing for video games. 

But, yeah, just throwing another two cents in about keeping your expectations in check - it's great to have a dream and there's nothing wrong with dreaming big, but please do realize that you're competing with a LOT of other people, many of whom have substantial academic and professional experience composing already. Even moreso, composing for video games isn't really lucrative - don't expect to pay your bills off of royalties from a couple of indie titles."

chrunchy,canada,1390849852.0,"You have some valid points, and let me address them.

&gt;Robots get cheaper, every day.

They do - and they don't. By that logic, cars should be free by now. A car cost $2K in the 50's. In today's dollars that $19K. Well, that's pretty much how much the average car lists for nowadays - if not more.

So when something like a LCD TV is introduced then the price is inflated by inefficiencies in the production and supply of new products. The price falls drastically as these issues get worked out but there comes a point where the price hits a floor and doesn't really drop any further.

&gt;Momentum Machines[2] built a machine to make burgers

Yup - and no doubt McDonalds is going to (or has done) research into developing these machines as well. McDonalds has a distinct advantage in that they can have ""head office"" do all the r&amp;d into developing these machines, bringing down the per-machine cost. But even then, the per-machine cost probably doesn't hit their ROI threshold - otherwise they would have rolled these machines out in other countries with higher wages already.

&gt;How many people do you figure make burgers for a living in North America ?

*For a living?*  Nobody at McDonalds I bet. 

&gt;The truth is, sixty years ago, the notion that every home would have a PC was beyond impractical. 

Well, sixty years ago a PC didn't exist, but I understand the point you're making - and you're right. The computer has made amazing strides into our lives. 

And robotics will make amazing leaps too. But we are not going to be hitting the point where there are no menial jobs for humans any time soon. All you have to do is look again at the 1950s with their flying cars and the Jetson's rosie the robot. They thought that this would all be reality in the 1980's. In those terms, we're 30 years late. 

And any time now, they should be introducing the hoverboard - according to Marty McFly.

I'm sure robotics are going to become cheap as shit to manufacture. I just don't think you or I are going to be around when it does.

Sztormcia,AskWomen,1390850130.0,"I'm a little bit late for this one but I still want to share how my tastes changed:

14-17
At first I consciously looked for someone who pay attention to me, listen to my troubles and read stories I was writing back then. I dreamed about an artist who can share with me my passions. Subconsciously I looked for someone confident and cool. My boyfriends and people who I was finding attractive were mix of both conscious and subconscious needs. My relationships wasn't serious back then, I'd call them ""unofficial"".

18-19
That was strange moment when I developed strong need of keeping long term relationship, so I grabbed first available buy from above characteristic and stick to him for whole year. After that experience I logically and emotionally understood that confidence and intelligence is nothing without emotional stability. Next person I get attracted to was exactly like that. Eccentric genius in very logical, intellectual way, but with almost no emotional intelligence. I ran away after first date and never again get attracted to analytical intelligence.

20-21
Then I glued myself to wise, experienced man who thought me a lot about emotions, but also was very popular and cool person/ He had it all intelligence, confidence, emotional knowledge/experience, but still he was one of the most miserable people I've seen in my life. When I've realised that it was moment when I started looking for emotional integrity.

22-23
So I found someone stable, and get crazy about him despite being in long term relationship and getting engaged to someone else in the middle of this period. Attraction is funny thing. That person I admired stayed neutral about it and waited 2 years till I get over him and now at least we can be friends.

Funny thing is attraction has very little to do with relationships. I was mostly attracted to blonde buys, but get into relationships only with black haired ones."

We are working with a trainer on changing the behavior and it's pretty tough but I'm hopeful we will start to see change over time. 

We have changed crates (from wire to hard solid plastic), removed all the bedding, are feeding him only in his crate, have him on a specific water/pee schedule, give him lots of chew toys in his crate to keep him occupied... he gets a bath every time he pees in his crate (which is sometimes twice a day) and the crate gets fully washed &amp; air-dried. Right now, we have to take him out every 3 hours to pee. That means he goes out at 2, 5, 8, and 11 (both am and pm). 

I take the 5am and 11am shift and my boyfriend takes the 2am and 2pm shift (thankfully we live 10 mins away from work). We divvy up all the others depending on what's going on that day.

Poor little guy. I feel bad for him, but hopefully with our diligence and effort, he will be fully potty trained by the end of the year.

Here's the thing: the only difference in an idea in your head and living out that idea is *doing it*. Do you have a plan for the next few months that just isn't ready yet? That's fine, do something small and productive in your spare time while you wait or just enjoy your free time while you have it. Read a book, pamper yourself, learn to cook the next thing you have a hankering for instead of going to a restaurant to get it, anything!

If you don't have any plans yet, then you have to start *doing*. Make a plan, act on it. Go find someone today, and make plans with them today to jam with them sometime this week. Start composing. Keep practicing! Maybe even make up a jam that translates the way you feel about yourself right now into something someone can hear. Do you have the resources to do the things you want? If yes, then DO THEM! If not, then get them. Don't have the money? Get a job. Find temp jobs if you have to.

Skulder,conspiracy,1390850202.0,"So we entertain the idea, but don't accept it.

The first chart is labeled ""influences on the climate"", and the sun makes out the most.

The sun's influence on climate is that it delivers a ton of energy to earth, which is subsequently lost to space as radiation. (except for any tiny bits that are stored in trees , eg.)

However, the greenhouse effect works as a multiplier, so even though that sliver is small, the effect is not really comparable on a pie chart.

Furthermore - the greenhouse effect is compared to a pie chart of the magnitude of *turning off* the sun.

Also, one is energy input, one is energy conservation.

in short, your pie chart relies on mixing units, and comparing irrelevant data.

But really, at one point it's easier to just label you ""climate denier"", shrug, and move on, because you're not really introducing new ideas anyway."

silverionmox,europe,1390850233.0,"&gt; There are only a couple of manufacturers that dominate the market

There's a single market in Europe...

&gt;No, again their goals are profits unless somebody sells something better at the same price(cost of technology and EU regulations make this impossible.

If it's impossible to design better vacuum cleaners, then what are you complaining about? You already have the best possible.

&gt;No, they can't because it's nominal, and not relative as in 130 g by year x and not year x will need to have the average dropped by 10 %. to hit that stupid average you nee to sell under powered vehicles.

Underpowered depends on usage. If true (which it isn't, but *passons*), then it makes sense that you, who wants a car that emits more CO2, has to pay more for the privilege.

&gt;but it's not the real ecological cost, smaller engines are less reliable because in every day use you force them more often, a car you bought in the 90s ran hundreds of thousands of kilometers, today even a vw will croack a couple of thousand km after it goes out of warranty.

That's hardly a matter of regulation, but rather of manufacturers finetuning their materials purchasing policy to fleece you as much as possible - they do that with or without regulation.

&gt;but we won't

Not so defeatist.

&gt;we consume much more now than in the 00's

The report shows that the level of greenhouse gases fell by 3.3% in the EU in 2011, leading to the lowest level of emissions since 1990 (18.4% below 1990 levels)

&gt;politiicans whipe themselfs clean by enforcing consumer markets but don't touch the big consumers.

Transport is responsible for 21% of EU greenhouse gas emissions.

&gt;Just pointing out how superficial these ecological fixes are.

That article was written by someone with car industry associations, so I would take it with a grain of salt. Feel free to suggest a solution that addresses all possible problems at once, anyway. This certainly won't solve all problems, but it will be useful to solve some.

&gt;eruopean cities have hills, hiways don't(also modern economical cars because the run at higher rpm on highways are actually less economical than a standard diesel)

Cars need to be optimized for different circumstances. As I said, using the same car for smooth highways and hilly cities will certainly show that it's less suitable for one of both.

&gt;I agree but due to the high cost, a bicicle or public transport still makes more sense, coviniece and ecological reason in those cases.
I'm a metro and taxi kinda guy.

See, we agree on that point. I'm sure that there'll be instances where using an electric car makes more sense than a fossil car, even if we keep them both around; sooner or later we're going to have to ration the stuff to make plastics anyway.

keakealani,singing,1390850255.0,"I agree with /u/asdfman123 that it sounds like there are two separate problems here. If you are going to be self-conscious... well, you're either going to have to get over it, or not sing. Singing is a *very* mental/psychological art; almost all of it is about training your brain to adjust processes that are mostly involuntary - you can't brute force your way to good singing. As a result, any psychological baggage you carry with you *will* affect your singing and can hamper development of good technique. 

On the other hand, it's absolutely reasonable to be concerned about noise with close by neighbors. I think the absolutely best way to handle this is to talk with your neighbors in advance and work out some times where they aren't likely to be home or needing quiet for some reason. Most of the time, practicing during normal daytime hours isn't a problem. 

Alternatively, you could start looking for practice facilities elsewhere - many universities have practice rooms that can be signed out even by members of the public (check with the music department for exact guidelines). Some churches and communities centers have available space that you might be able to use or rent cheaply (consider trading a service like janitorial services, in exchange for the use of a practice room). 

Ultimately, though, practicing shouldn't be about how ""good"" you sound - that's absolutely the wrong mentality for success. The important part is developing skills and training yourself to make music. If you're only worried about sounding good for others, you already have the wrong mentality about music, imo."

Once you catch on to the reality of regulatory capture in America it's pretty easy to see all over the place. I think people are slow to catch on, though, because to really register the problem usually involves disillusionment with whoever you were inclined to think of as the ""good guys"" in the equation--that would be business leaders, for the conservative-leaning, and government regulators, for the liberal-leaning.  It's hard for people to give up the idea that whatever's wrong would be fixed if their ""good guys"" just had more power than the ""bad guys."" It takes an intuitive leap to realize that the power all goes into one pot, that the good guys and the bad guys feed each other out of.

I guess it would take me quite a while to fully explain why, but that particular quote is a bigger red flag than anything else I've seen coming out of D-Wave so far... 

...

There's a part in the article where one of his investors comments on how completely he was taken in when D-Wave was almost broke... and it was curious to me that, once he knew that he had financially rescued them unwittingly, the investor wasn't concerned or worried by Rose's concealment of his predicament, but instead was impressed by it... and that won him further investment money.

However, I think it's important to note that mental stress can take a toll on the physical recovery - the more you worry about these types of things, the more you can divert your body's resources away from healing and recovering. So even if it's counterintuitive, it's important to take some deep breaths and avoid panicking. If you need to, try meditating or reflective breathing techniques.

Start off anything by sticking your toe in the water to see what it feels like.  If it's warm and comfy, take another step in.  If it's still nice, then check the depth and make the dive.

We started working at nights together after working at our day jobs.  The kids are grown so it's just me and my partner. We were paid off on most things except mortgage, so we were in a good position to live on minimal income if necessary.  

There was some 401k money we cashed out that we figured would carry us for 4 to 6 months if we were tight. In doing this, there was no back up funding, or easy way out.  We were committed to be successful or we would going back to the corporate grind IF we could find a job.  [Never slam the door on the way out]  When I gave notice they begged me to work at least 1/2 days for another month or 2.  I agreed to help them and that helped out some too.

Ultimately it is the scariest thing that you can do.  Leaving the comfort of regular checks with no guarantee of future income is not for the faint of heart.

A world making in on my own? No. Maybe you have never belonged within a community, maybe you live your whole life and never talked to your neighbour, or went out and talked to strangers. But people given the choice work hard, they do right by their fellow man, if you assemble as a community anything is possible - democracy is possible.

In this life we are all soldiers, we must fight but we only work as a unit. Until you force the good in this world to mobilise you're just going to see evil men shit all over us.

I'm not unprepared to fight because like you said, in this life there is property to fight over, and it belongs to the people who work hard and do right by their fellow people. Not the children of the men who our forefathers empowered to rule their lives.

You don't need an absolute authority at all, because that position attracts the greedy men who feel entitled to the world just because they are trusted. Democracy cannot work with leadership, one man has ultimate power and all bets are off, he forms a legion of elite men and slowly leeches away the freedom of others.

There is one way to get around that - that is to empower the people, to get rid of the fear to rise up against the greedy. Don't you see? We already live in a state of perpetual fear, fear of the state, they are the greedy fucking army that tells us how to live our lives.

I understand the shortcomings of my ideas, but at this point I'm willing to try anything, and when problems arise, we'll cross that bridge. But you seem completely incapable of recognizing how disgustingly oppressed we are as a society, how little freedom we actually have. 

The only freedom we have in this life is the freedom to lay down and fucking die, and if they could take that away from us, they sure as shit would. Afraid? You should be, because the worst is yet to come. I'd sooner be living in fear someone could shoot me in the head for my actions in society, than living in fear the government will brand me a terrorist and torture me for having an opinion which denigrates from their game plan."

Even the most ""mindless"" book requires some internal interpretation; conjuring up an image of the scene, visualizing the details of the characters or setting.

A movie or video game - and I'm a consumer of both of these things - requires nothing other than passive reception. (Well, a good game *will* engage your brain, and good movies *can* be thought provoking, but the point is that all else being equal, a book will engage you more than these other media.)

It is like the continuum between AAA blockbuster movies and two 8 year olds putting on a ""play"". We should be less enamored with the former, and more enamored with the latter, than we currently are.

We should make cards (with bad poetry) for our loved ones, rather than buying something from Hallmark. We should make more (imperfect) music, rather than simply consuming it.

Sometimes the media expects that out of white people but not black people which is racist in itself.

Also you have to look at fuel costs. An entire plane full of obese people probably uses more fuel than an entire plane full of regular sized people. I always assumed the second ticket price was for the fact they weight twice as much as normal people, along with the fact they can spill over into a second seat. 

Having done a lot of flying recently, these seats are pretty packed. Not to mention the need to wiggle around if you have a long flight. I sat next to a bunch of average-sized people and we ended up bumping knees or sides once in awhile. I really couldn't imagine having to sit directly next to someone who used more than their allotted seat space.

However, one flight (Southwest Airlines) I got a seat and there were two empty seats next to me. An overweight gentleman (really big but not necessarily *wide*) took the aisle seat and we collectively shared the seat in the middle for our things. I didn't mind at all that he was overweight because there was a seat between me and it affected me none. Actually it made it nicer because I got room to move around  and change position without someone next to me. Whether or not he paid for two seats or just found an empty one, I don't know.

I've never used git hooks before, but the examples are straight UNIX shell scripts, and I assume they run as batch scripts on Windows.  post-checkout is probably the hook you want.

An alternative is to just write a simple shell script to do the setup and name it something like setup.sh (or setup.bat).  Git should store the executable bit properly if you are using a UNIXy OS, so your users can just double click setup.sh.

If you need sudo/root access, I recommend putting a 'real' setup script somewhere not in the root directory, and having a simple root setup.sh that just runs *gksudo &lt;real-setup-script.sh&gt;*."

Legs spread apart about shoulder width. Stand straight. Then, bend the knees and lean forward until your chest is up against your thighs (easier than it sounds with bent knees). Now, slowly straighten your knees as much as you can. Deep hamstring stretch!

I've known people who struggle with the motivation to diet and exercise, but who are very productive and motivated in other areas of their lives. So, I guess it's the automatic assumptions that bother me. 

Self-discipline can be measured in variety of ways, some of which are often neglected or very subjective. When I was in my eating disorder and weighed 80 pounds, it would have taken MORE self-discipline for me to stick to my meal plan and gain weight than it would have been for me to stay in my illness and behaviors.

Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1390851070.0,"Lovely palette, and nice use of areas of high contrast and low detail to establish a clear focal point. It's a little entrancing to look at.

That said, if judged as a creature design, it would fall rather short - reason being that a design exists foremost for the information it can convey to other artists and creators, be they 3D modelers, illustrators, etc. In order to create a strong design, the artist must ask themselves numerous questions. For example, how does this creature move? How and what does it eat? What kind of environment does it thrive in? Does it breathe?

Pretty as it is, this piece makes it difficult to determine where the create ends and the surrounding area begins. I can see what appears to be a mouth, and perhaps an eye, but I'm not certain of how it is able to move its body. Is it underwater? Do those tentacle things help it swim around?

Last of all, I love that you're trying to really push the boundaries with your shape language, but be careful of straying too far from what is familiar. The reason a lot of artists will base their creature designs off existing animals is not because they are not imaginative, but because their audience, their viewers, will find those creatures far easier to understand and appreciate."

This year's obviously a disappointment, but they did go 7/9, not 2/14. The tickets are still very cheap compared to the rest of the NFL (not that that really matters to me... Our schedule is kinda meh this year)

As a season ticket holder I don't feel fucked over at all. If you wanted a refund from the playoff debacle you can get one. But more importantly, those stupid preseason games you HAVE to buy if you want season tickets are now only like 40$ of my total cost instead of 20% (140$) of the cost. I may not make as much profit if I decide to sell my primetime tickets, but the market will probably adjust since the base price will go up.

Even in his only playoff win, he almost mucked it all up by taking our last timeout with too much time left on the clock, because I think he panicked or something.

His locker room speeches don't really do anything for me (although I wouldn't prefer a Jim Harbaugh-esque approach/performance either), I think his play calling gets stale, and he feels more like the safe pick than the strong pick.

I think I'm in the minority though, although the people who really dislike Smith can be more vocal about it than me.

MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE,badhistory,1390851223.0,"I'm always skeptical of claims about the separability of approach/methodology from ontology/normative program.

For example, if individualism is a central normative and analytical and ontological component of liberalism, it makes it difficult to then employ a class-based analysis without also doing violence to a normative/ontological commitment to the individual."
keakealani,musictheory,1390851223.0,"I'd agree with those who would analyze this type of structure as a polychord - by the time you begin extending this much, I think the relation to the root becomes obscured and the natural inclination is to hear the nearest triad or seventh chord as the related harmony (assuming you're never displacing octaves, we're talking about tones that are in vastly different registers already, and it's hard to hear one common harmony in different registers). 

I'd also say this is why harmonic analysis often has to be accompanied by a healthy dose of musical context. For example, a simple arpeggiation of alternating major and minor thirds might actually be read as a synthetic scale - similar to the octatonic scale of alternating major and minor seconds, but extended to refer to thirds instead. (I think this is pretty similar to polychords anyway, but it could have a scalar quality in certain contexts). 

The voice leading and melody might also be important - if you have a certain key center defined by the melody, the other tones might take on the character of various chromatic alterations - even though a #15 might make sense in spelling the extended chord, it may feel more like a b2 in reality, since that's a fairly common alteration/nod to phrygian mode. This is even more true if these tones lead somewhere else - then you can generally use the rule of thumb that notes resolving up will feel like sharps, and notes resolving down will feel like flats. 

Anyway, I think it's an interesting question, but part of the answer is how it would actually be used in music, more than what to name a stand-alone chord."

DrStephenFalken,AskReddit,1390851258.0,"As a cook of over ten years. I love tipping out. It creates a sense of community in my restaurant. Cooks are the lowest paid people in the restaurant. Often cooks are get a dollar or two more than minimum wage. On an average night a cook that comes in at 4pm will make about $50 for his 7 to 8 hours of work. Where I have servers making $150+ for 4 hours of work. In all honesty the servers only bring food to the table, and talk to the customer. They don't do any of the hard work of prepping, washing dishes, cooking etc. I'm not saying their job is easy but IMO it's the easiest of all the restaurant jobs and yet they're paid the most. 

Tipping out shows that the waitstaff is appreciative of everyone's hard work. If it wasn't for everyone in the back of the house they wouldn't be able to do their job efficiently. 

I've also found that tipping out creates a better sense of community and makes everyone work harder. Cooks, dishwashers, prep people etc want to work harder and better so the servers can get better tips so they can get more money. People don't want to let each other down. The team feels as if they've failed if a server doesn't get good tips.

Most often in kitchens I've ran where the back of the house doesn't get tipped out they often ""don't give a shit"" and work at their own pace and do things their own way.

silverionmox,europe,1390851490.0,"&gt; Yes - but they would have had a floating currency, and a chance to sell their product.

They can drop their prices now too, with the same effect - but they can keep buying raw materials with a strong currency, and they can guarantee investors that their investments won't suddenly drop in value.

&gt;Source for that the Greek economy (and the Portuguese or Spanish) would have been smaller than it is now

They never would have seen the high growth rates they had just after entering the euro. Can't be proven either way, but assuming business as usual without the euro makes sense.

&gt;and in more trouble.

The same trouble. Note that their GDP is still somewhat higher than before the eurozone entry, so what in fact happened is just that their bubble popped. Of course that's a painful correction, but not the euro's fault. Bubbles happen everywhere on the planet, in all kinds of countries, in eg. the USA, Sweden, China, the Netherlands.

&gt;Furthermore - again, you are ignoring 

I'm not, I've said repeatedly that is a normal adjustment and that monetary devaluation wouldn't have been less painful. More addictive perhaps, since countries who use devaluation once typically keep using it again and again. How has Argentina fared? Not very well.

&gt;Wrong again. No, it is Economics 101 - what happens when a country suffers from internal devaluation, and yes, it is the fault of the Euro. Please, do not take my word for it. Link.Link.

The first link says it's the fault of a lack of competitivity and a number of oligopolies in the Greek economy. The second says the problems are a recession and the lack of buying power in the periphery due to restrictive social policies. So that doesn't support your ""blame the euro"" mantra at all, but rather my point that the social policy in the eurozone is too strict, and we should print a bit of money to support the periphery in its adjustment. The Eurozone isn't too lax in enforcing budgetary rigidity, it's too strict.

And what have you to offer an alternative solution? Instead of reducing the buying power of Greek wages, you suggest they should have devaluated, so their drachmas could buy less imports, in effect reducing the buying power of their wages *and* the working capital of their companies. How is that any better?

&gt;Not an answer.

Not one you like, but an answer nonetheless.

&gt;That is rich - now you are blaming us. That is frankly pathetic. And idiotic and wrong.

Back to your core argumentation, I see.

Why should we accept that abuse? If you don't have a constructive alternative, stop bitching around to those who *are* trying to do something and shut up. If you can't bear that, leave."

Why not compare a subsidized daycare system to a private system?
Answer: It's irrelevant. 
For starters, you pay an extra 9.5% of your income towards taxes which helps pay for this. Having worked in quebec daycares, and being part of the discussion my whole life, the benefits of the system are truly great. Moms are given the choice to go back to work, even with several kids in childcare, it's affordable. 

Having moved to Ontario, I now can't afford to have children by myself, as a single working woman desiring to be a mom, this is not feasible. 

The government pays approximately 25$/day per child. For infants the cost goes up to 40$/day I believe. 

Make less than a certain amount/year? The 7$ cost drops to 5$/day and sometimes it's free with 100% coverage. 

Great support for women and families, not relevant to comparing Ontario resident costs.

It looks like it could have bend quite a bit more in the tips to save the inner limbs from set, and the tips don't seem especially refined, but besides that it looks like it should be a good bow.

The set might mean the cast per draw weight is pretty low, but that could be a matter of debate and speculation as the effects of set haven't been adequately quantified to make a call. Hickory isn't the fastest wood but this shouldn't do terribly with its twenty five pounds.

**In summary**, it's not all that great a bow and it seems to have been built hastily, but even with that going against it the hickory should do its job well. It should serve you well to get restarted, but you'll want a better bow later on.

That's because they started out at a major disadvantage. Currently society is much more egalitarian and therefore the problem is not as one sided.

&gt;what exactly is the ""One True Feminism""

I would say the fight for equality and against male domination. IE: reproductive rights (conservative men preventing women from making choices in regards to their own bodies), women's suffrage (equality when it comes to voting and holding political office), against male domination/violence/harrassment in marriages and in the workplace (pretty much already won), etc..

For a comparison, take an extremist community like SRS. You will find almost no rational viewpoints/arguments. Almost all of it is opinions/reactions from extremist, unimaginative, bigoted, narrow-minded, overly sensitive, reactionary people who lack analytical &amp; critical thinking skills.

But then compare that to a valid tenet like woman's suffrage.

Equal treatment when it comes to workplace (not including physical requirements), business, marriage, etc.. Things like requiring a women to have a man sign for a loan is something I heard about recently that used to exist.

The moderate increase in memory bandwidth is outweighed by the large difference in stream processors, at least for gaming. For litecoin mining, scrypt is very memory-intensive, but I think it is possible to set up the cards to mine independantly in which case rather than mirroring the memory on each, you get double the throughput (4GB at 360GB/s total). Since GPU miners do not have to be in crossfire.

When they arrested my partner and GF 3 months later for cultivation and possession of marijuana.

Ultimately, we fought the DA and his retarded plea offers for 2 years before we went to jury trial. After a week long trial we were found innocent of all charges.  It cost us $20,000 for lawyers, but was the right thing to do.  We set many precedents and inspired others to take their case to trial. (and they all won)

If it were me I probably wouldn't tell Ann just because if she doesn't really need to know I can't see a reason to make her upset too. But other than that I would definitely try to just move on and do better next time. It seems like Beth understands that you wouldn't purposefully do something that would make her uncomfortable and you wouldn't have done it had you known she was awake. So yeah, icky feelings and all that but you can't change the past, you can only try to do better and not make the same mistake again in the future.

My suggestion would be that if you are going to have Ann over again would be to perhaps find a way for Beth to stay somewhere else (go visit a friend or family maybe) or perhaps invest in a pair of ear plugs."

ILoveBigOil,personalfinance,1390851793.0,"I currently have 3 savings and 2 checking accounts.

The first savings is for homeowner's insurance and property taxes, and a portion of my paycheck is automatically placed in this account 2x a month. The second savings is my normal emergency fund; currently it is filled w/ 6 months expenses, and nothing is deposited regularly in this account as of now because it is where I want it to be. The third savings is my ""Misc. savings"" account, where the remainder of my paycheck goes after paying all expenses and allocating to the other savings accounts.

The first checking is for fixed expenses (I know exactly what they'll be every month). Mortgage, trash collection, Netflix, internet, etc. I put *only* that amount in this account every month, plus 10% in case there is a billing error, so it doesn't overdraw (which shouldn't be a problem if it is in error, but I'd rather just avoid the situation altogether). The second checking is for variable expenses...basically all other expenses that will vary from month to month (groceries, electric/gas, etc.) My CC payments *only* come from this account and never touch the ""fixed expenses"" account, so I know I'll always have enough for the mortgage and related expenses.

This method helps me know precisely where I am regarding expenses and savings of various natures at any time, and I find it much more useful than my old system with just 1 checking and 1 savings account."

superior22,summonerschool,1390851829.0,"One more thing about their jungler, look from which side the mid laner enters the lane, do their bot duo or their top laner appear first in lane? That way you can guess which buff their jungler started. Most of the time at least. Jungler usually finishes his second buff somewhere between 03.15 - 03.30. If he started bottom buff top and mid lane should be careful around this time while bot lane can go more aggressive. If he started top buff mid and bot lane should be careful while top can play more aggressive. 

The first buff will usually re-spawn at around 07.20 and if he started with his bottom buff their jungler will be between top and mid lane at around 8-9 minutes into the game after clearing the other buff. If you learn the times the buffs re-spawn you do yourself a big favor because you can guess where the enemy jungler is right now."

Once you get spirit stone you can pretty much sustain in the jungle very well. 

Riot changed jungle items to get better sustain in the jungle. I took lifesteal quints pre patch because they were pretty much mandatory on some junglers but I can swap them out with movement speed quints now.

You take 2 Lifesteal quints to get better sustain in the jungle early but that's what health pots are for. Once you get your spirit stone, the lifesteal quints become useless.

I don't think that the LS quints make you pull off more ganks at all.

People will quickly call beards manly, yet only men shave with straight razors. The description of masculinity as given by the majority of the Internet is an unattainable caricature. As displayed by your earlier comment the main point of many people claiming masculinity is not to be a better man, but rather to not be feminine. And that is ridiculous. Choosing to box yourself in and limit yourself simply because something isn't manly.

Celidos,relationship_advice,1390851985.0,"I understand that feeling of neglect, but you've got to see it from her perspective. I'm not saying this as a lady, but as a lady that was in a relationship a long time ago where I was in your position. 

If you ask every few days, or initiate constantly, she has no chance to enjoy your affections without worrying about you wanting sex. She doesn't want to kiss you and lead you on into thinking that it's because she wants sex. She has very few opportunities to enjoy your and your support without the sex thing on her constantly. There's a pressure to perform, and it just makes her fight it more. Whether romancing comes naturally or not, you're moving in the right direction. The best marriages come from the ones that never stop dating each other, so keep going as you have started!"

DERangEdKiller,comicbooks,1390852245.0,"Yeah, I think you'd have a hard time with DC, and here's why.
Note, look for the bisecting line to skip to the next company.

__________________________________________________________

**DC:** The thing's you'd love about DC, is that everything old is new again.  When they started the New 52, it was an effective relaunch of their universe.  what might turn you off about it is that you have to follow so many titles to fully grasp what's going on. If you like Batman, then the over arching stories have ramifications within his entire family, and require you to read Batman, Batman and Robin, Batman Inc (while it ran) and the occasional nightwing and Batgirl.

If you read  Superman, you need to read Action Comics (Covers Year 1-5) and superman which is Year 5 and up (actually Present time in DC,) as well as The occasional Superboy (which crosses over regularly with Teen Titans), and Supergirl.  Then you'd have to read Superman/Wonderwoman as well and on and on.

I've decided the Rule of thumb is if you only read the tent poles and there's a crossover, read the other titles bearing the same numbers as most of them started at the same time.

The Green Lantern stuff is awesome, and much easier to follow.  It's pretty much isolated, but you should go back to Rebirth from before the reboot, and read that, the Yellow Lantern War, Blackest Night, and Brightest Day in that order.  Then start the new 52 titles of Green Lantern, Green Lantern Corp, Green Lantern: New Guardians, and Red Lanterns. 

Don't even get me started on how this all ties in with 3 different Justice Leagues.  Pre-Flashpoint/52 was so much easier to manage.

__________________________________________________________

**Darkhorse:** This is the place to be for EU retconed Star Wars comics that are ongoing, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Predator, Aliens, and last but certainly not least, Spawn.  Great stuff, but you might need a few Omnibus' to understand what's going on fully.

__________________________________________________________

**Image Comics**

If you're open to a superhero coming of age story that is really expansive within the confines of its universe, I recommend Kirkman's Invincible.

**Why you'll like Invincible.** Not even going through the creatives, It seemed like Image was on its last leg when Robert Kirkman wowed them with Walking Dead, and they gave him free reign over their superhero titles.  (Darkhawk, Savage Dragon, etc) anyways, expect Every 20th issue or so to basically purge the stuff that doesn't work in the Image U.  When I read Invincible it's like popping a beer and watching a destruction derby.  It boarders on the insane.

__________________________________________________________

**Marvel:**  Avengers is a good start, but I also recommend picking up All New X-Men, which is a great time displacement series staring the original X-Men stuck in our time.  You need to cover both sides of the Mutant front.  Both Cyclops' X-men, and Wolverines.  I mainly only follow Wolverine and the X-men, but Amazing X-Men is Wolverine's team and is currently 2 issues into the return of Nightcrawler, another great read.

If you are interested in Marvel's first Family, then to fully appreciate it, you'd have to read Fantastic Four, and Future Foundation.  F 4 is about the adults, while Future foundation involves the adults, and the cache of child geniuses.  The stuff with Valeria, Reed and Sue's little girl is really fun to see unfold.

Other than that,  you should know the biggies of the Marvel U.  Anything X-men recently varies, but you should read Messiah War, Chasm, and the latest Phoenix event to start.

Avengers:  I recommend going back to Civil War, Invasion, Dark Avengers, Age of Ultron, and then into Infinity.

__________________________________________________________

**Amazing Events, and Archs you really should read if for no other reason then they're awesome.**

DC- Crisis Series: Crisis on Infinite Earths, Identity Crises, Infinite Crisis, and Final Crisis.  A lot happens in them, and they were written over the course over 20 years I think.

Superman/Batman Vol.1 and 2. would go between Infinite Crisis and Final Crisis, but isn't really crucial to the events after The Crisis on Infinite Earths.

Worlds At War, and JLA's The Obsidian Age

Flash:Rebirth, and Flashpoint (leads into the New 52 titles)
__________________________________________________________

Marvel: Aside from what I added above within the marvel stuff,  For Thanos, and massive hero crossovers, read The Infinity Gauntlet, and it's sequels The Infinity War, and The Infinity Crusade.

The Xtreme X-Men run was amazing, and you can collect it in its entirety through the trades.

The early Runaways is a fun read maybe vols 1-3?  I can't remember.

If you're wondering what happened to all the mutants, read House of M.
_________________________________________________________

Other stuff:  Zenoscope, or Xenoscope's Alice in wonderland stuff, warning, it's a little twisted, and definitely not for kids.

The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen vol 1 and 2.

Crimson - Starts off as a whinny kid turned into a vampire, and basically burns the place to the ground.  Best ending I've read in a series, and you can get all of them as trades.

Although it was short lived, I pour a little beer out every now and then for Cowboy Ninja Viking.  Funny and cool as hell.

Cool Crossovers:  Batman Vs. Predator, both 1 and 2 (avoid 3).

Terminator Vs. Robocop

Marvel Vs. DC and JLA vs. Avengers were okay, but were really just overblown fan service in my book.  Still, the art is amazing.

If you love Spider-man, read Amazing Spider-man trades. Read Todd McFarlane's run on spiderman.  It was something we hadn't seen before and it blew us all away.  You can Go Maximum Carnage, and have a good time, stay away from the clone saga.  It's not really worth your time, but if you want to hit prime modern amazing spiderman, start with Vol 2 number 30.  The start of the totem story arch, and you can pick up around issue 507 for Grim Hunt.  Honestly I thought most of Amazing Spider-man from when they went back to the original numbering right down to the end of the title was great reading.


Also the first volume of the new She-hulk.  The stuff when she was in the courts.  It was funny, but had kind of a Franklin &amp; Bash/ Allie Mcbeal feel to it.

Enjoy."

I disagree that that perception exists as a dominant force - people are very well aware where tax money comes from, and are very well aware of inflation - overly, I'd say (regional and group variance applies).

&gt;Businesses can't do that.

They can, however, externalize their costs to a much greater extent (eg. a government sacking employees still has to pay unemployment benefits, or failing that dealing with rising crime, while firms just carry on merrily with less costs). They also can go bankrupt while their former shareholders go about their business whistling - a government going bankrupt still has to deal with mostly the same mess afterwards, so the incentive to avoid that is higher for governments.

&gt;they actually have to make products and provide services people willingly want to obtain in exchange for money.

**General things**

* Major already wants them off this case, but agrees to give them two days for digging into new direction

* Neither of interviewing detectives have been in gunfight, but by hints of it Cohle &amp; Hart will end up in real shitshow

 * *""That day, it reminded me of my pop talking about 'Nam and the jungle thing""*

     -Cohle

 * Heart doesn't want to talk about it because he thinks interviewers wouldn't get it and Cohle doesn't see any importance in talking about it

**Cohle**

* The box man

 * Really good interrogator

     * Never has spent more than 10 minutes in a room

* When described to his *blind date*, to **Jennifer**;

 * Maggie thinks he has edgy personality

 * Intense, introverted, personality according Hart

 * Hart jokes that Cohle doesn't want to be close with anybody, *""Getting him near you lap is gonna be the challenge""*

* *Blind date* with Jennifer most likely doesn't pan out because it's suggested that they both know what they want, are looking for, and they aren't match while being alone doesn't bother them. 

 * Also it was previously mentioned that Cohle got serious, later on, with another woman called Laurie

 * During *date* he refuses to drink. Heard Jennifer's notion about drunk dates and wants to leave good impression?

* Has [synesthesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia)

 * Type of hyper sensitivity

     * One sense triggers another sense

         * Seeing color can put taste into his mouth

         * A touch, a texture, a scent may put a note in his head

* Has very well controlled, self aware, body movement and language

* Has spent a month in Paris

 * Mainly got drunk in front of Notre Dame

* Doesn't think man can love, *""at least not the way that he means""*

 * *""Inadequacies of reality always set in""*, meaning that man is destined to look for fulfillment outside of his *love*?

* Sees himself as bad man and it doesn't bother him because world needs bad men. They keep other bad men from the door

* Thinks that there is relief, letting go, in eyes of murder victims. How those victims first fought back, wanting to live, but finally realizing how easy it's to let go. How letting go brings peace and relief to them.

 * Realization that life you had was just a dream inside of *locked room*, dream about being a person. Every dream has a monster at end of it.

**Hart**

*""Everybody is a fucking drama queen nowadays""*

* Uses people, family, as something that gives man rules and shape of things

 * Yet another of his bullshit excuses, but I think in the end he really wants to believe it all. Wishing that he would have been better man in the past and lived up to his image of good man.

 * He thought that Cohle needed family, to give him boundaries, while he didn't have any boundaries himself

* Went to drinking spree, 3 days in a row

* Thinks he is in love with Maggie &amp; Lisa at same time

* Thinking if he is a bad man. Reflecting it to Cohle by asking; *""Do you wonder ever if you're a bad man?""*

* Thinks that Rianne's grandfather is intentionally ignoring the fact that she is dead, ignoring what is happening around him. He think that Cohle and this old man has that in common, ignoring their surroundings so they don't need to see and wake up to the world.

* Can be impatient, *""Who walks that fucking slow?""*

**Maggie Hart**

* Is amused by Jennifer's notion of *""So when something feels good, does that mean it feels twice as good, like from two different ways?""* as it's clearly about sex

* While dancing with Martin he stares at Lisa and she asks him about stare, not knowing what he is staring at. He lies to Maggie and Maggie knows it, her face says as much
 
**Lisa Tragnetti**

* Wants to break it off with Hart

* Afraid of him? Removes hers hand from hers dates thigh when she notices Hart looking at them at dance place

* She is uncomfortable with Hart as his behavior becomes more radical

 * Hart wants to own her, decide how she is supposed to live hers life?

     * Lisa doesn't see any future in theirs relationship, *""That's my whole point. It's just run its course""*, where Hart doesn't want it to end

 * Him basically breaking into hers apartment, beating up hers date

 * Sees how obsessive he is over her

     * Even when she is just something for Hart to use to *""decompress before you can go being a family man""*

**Case**

* Cohle found another vic matching signature

 * 3 years old case

     * Flood case, in Abbeville area

 * Vic's death was ruled as accidental, drowning

mr_fishy,polyamory,1390852372.0,"Speaking as someone who's mom just recently got remarried, I know why you would definitely worry about your kids. I'm 21, but I'm the oldest out of three - my youngest sibling is 12. So far though, neither myself nor my sister has had any problems. My brother (17) has, but he's got problems with everyone in general so that wasn't surprising.

But I digress. What I'm trying to get at is that you'd be surprised how easily kids acclimate to this sort of thing. Assuming that everyone's kids likes all the other parents and kids, this sort of thing really shouldn't be that hard. It won't be much different than my situation. I have three dads now, basically, it's just that my mom is only currently with one of them. If she decided to get back together with either my previous stepdad or my actual dad, the only thing that would change is I wouldn't have to make three trips if I wanted to see everyone.

Basically as long as it won't cause any legal issues as far as custody of your kids, I wouldn't worry too much about this. Kids are really flexible, and it's not like they'll lose out on attention if they suddenly gained two more parents. They'll probably enjoy it. But you should certainly talk to them about it at some point.

* **Q Nightclub** has trap music on Saturdays, as well as some other days of the week.  Best sound system available in the nation (as of last year, at least).  Mostly local DJs, but there are bigger headliners who come in occasionally.

* **Foundation Nightclub** is owned by USC Events (The folks who bring you Freaknight, Resolution, Lucky and Paradiso) and is rated the #55 best nightclub in the world by DJ Magazine.  It is Seattle's hot spot for big name DJs.  That said, it is more of a concert venue when it comes to admission.  Most cover prices range from $15 to $25.

Popular show venues to keep an eye on:

* Neumos

* Showbox (Sodo and Market)

* Paramount


Other clubs that are decent:

* **Aston Manor** has occasional headliners as well, but I don't know much about their reputation as good EDM venue.  I believe it's a bit more on the ""bro"" side.  It isn't someplace I'd go.

* The Woods at Grim's

* Neighbors/Therapy

* See Sound Lounge

* Last Supper Club

* Contour

* Trinity

* Acquabar

* and Volume (personally I'd steer clear because of violence history, but there is a lot of EDM here)"

In the end, it is his choice. If he manages to avoid the misogynist pitfalls, then I won't care.

In regards to your other post...a friend (at least mine) wouldn't bite your head off because you didn't ""have proof"" (even without the texts from the cheating GF that you ignore). Eye-witness testimony is gold in court; its more than enough between friends. (Or, I suppose it would be between friends who've established a history of honesty and being there for each other when things get shitty)

And don't worry, I don't offend easily. I'm just curious if there's ever a time you *would* care enough to help a friend? Like, on the scale of ""big deals"", a cheating SO is one of the biggest.  If you didn't say anything; fine...but when *would* you? When your friend's girlfriend is pregnant? When your friend reveals that they're now HIV positive? I understand those are extremes, but I'd rather send a text to a friend now than have to ""be that guy"" who tells their friend ""Actually, yeah I could have prevented you raising some other dude's kid...but I didn't want to involve myself in your drama because I was too busy with the drama of internet strangers, *friend*...."""
CaiserZero,3DS,1390852612.0,"I would not recommend playing Monster Hunter on the 2DS, even if the person have big hands. I say this because of the positioning of the main buttons and the touch screen.

I laugh at him often because I've voted for Badnarik (Libertarian) for President in 2004 and have voted for a slew of 3rd parties and Libertarians in other elections as well. Yet, at the end of the day he labels me a Democrat because my views are more liberal than his

They wanted another bland WW2 title. But Zampella did it anyway, and defied them.

The Titanfall ""formula"" is obviously what they wanted to do after MW2, but Activision was seeing dollar signs and wanted MW3, so Zampella defied them again. And now here we are 4 years and a HUGE settlement at Activisions expense later, about to watch the game Activision didnt want to make fuck them and CoD right in the ass.

Essentially, the good advice gets crowded out.

Snipers are support. So lets give our infiltrator a support weapon.

Give him a sniper rifle which has 30 rounds in it. The rounds do no damage, but they knock shields out.

Our TR sniper pal can sit on a vantage point, popping the shields of all the NC and VS scum who are fighting the glorious TR soldiers. The lack of shields keeps them suppressed, the large magazine allows them engage multiple hostiles for a prolonged period, and the lack of any *real* damage prevents the issue of being too OP for the TR trait of high ROF and high mag size.

2. Before leaving for the interview if it's face to face, or about 15-30min before the interview if it isn't in person, exercise. Endorphin release, confidence booster. I personally do some pushups.
3. Right before the interview, try to go to the bathroom or somewhere private and practice ""power posing"" for at least 2min. ""Power posing"" is exactly what it sounds like, some sort of pose that makes you *feel* powerful, just 2min of doing this increases testosterone and lowers cortisol, confidence booster.

For example, if the pattern tells you to cast on 150 sts, that should gives you 35.29 inches if you have the correct gauge and 33.09 inches if your gauge is smaller. That exta 2ish inches can make a big difference in fit. 

That being said, I looked at the pattern and it does have a ton of positive ease, so being off by a couple inches might not be a big deal for this particular project. If you like the fabric at 3.75 sts/in I say go ahead.

huisme,Archery,1390852977.0,"&gt; Edit: Would different types of wood alter the bows performance or can they be made to perform the same?

Wood species plays a big role in the difference between top-quality selfbows.

Osage orange is a very stable bow that takes little to no set where other woods would and keeps its cast/speed longer than any other bow wood I know of. It seems to have decent cast, though its stability seems to be the real magic in this wood.

Black locust has higher tension/compression modules than osage orange, but its tension strength is ridiculously higher than its compression strength, and the disparity causes the belly of the bow to be more subject to fretting even though it is fairly resistant to set. All of this means that black locust should always make a faster bow than osage, but it takes a lot of work to make it anywhere near as long-lived.

Yew is pretty much *the* longbow wood. Its high compression strength and not-bad tension strength means it's perfect for the narrow, round-bellied design-- though it will need overlays, and the longbow design isn't the most efficient (I don't make them for such reasons, more work than I want to put up with, but others make fantastic bows from the stuff)

Maples, hickories, oaks, elms, and other such woods can make excellent bows, but the three 'top' woods have qualities that just make them a bit better in certain ways. Hickory is almost indestructible to abrasive forces, but it takes set. Another option would be ipe, but I honestly don't know enough about that to comment.

I personally work with black locust for my high-performance bows (I've made a few that are faster than equal draw fiberglass recurves, trying to do that consistently but it seems a lot of it is in the stave rather than me) and vine maple for more affordable and easy to make but still very usable and very pretty bows. Other bowyers have a lot more variety than I, others specialize like I do, and still others really prefer to do one or two designs and that's it.

As long as you go with someone who's willing to put their work under the microscope of other bowyers you should get your money's worth. You put a lot into your work when every transaction has the potential to ruin your reputation or sustain it ;)"

You can’t help but read on and I keep getting stronger, because I’m not just some character, once read and easily forgotten. I’m one of the most insidious things that can ever get in your head: an idea. 

I’ll jump off this page and sneak in, and you won’t even notice until it’s too late. By then, I’ll be too far in, wiggling and delving and crawling into the furthest reaches of your psyche. To you, it will be a simple thought, one that will barely register in your conscious mind. That’s the beauty. Once it’s in your mind, it will change your world, and you can’t stop it. 

Oh, and the best part? I just did it.

einTier,teslamotors,1390853049.0,"We're in the same boat.  I come from sports cars and primarily Porsches, so there's little luxury the Tesla feels like it lacks.

What I miss is the fact that it's got really great performance for what it is, but the car isn't really built with that in mind.  The seats in particular are a huge issue for me.  The ""performance seats"" are anything but -- my Porsche seats were worlds better and even the seats in the new CTS-V are a night and day difference.  There's just no side bolstering and that sucks.  If I keep the car long term, I'll be replacing them. 

I also feel there's no real space to put things so they're not flung around the cabin and are still easy to access.  I really miss the door pockets my Cayman S had (same as the 997 911).  I don't carry much, but I still routinely fling my sunglasses out of the center pocket. 

The chassis is a bit numb and nowhere as precise as the Cayman, but I feel I'm picking nits there. 

Ultimately though, I feel I'm going to sell the car within the year.  I love it, but I'm not in love with it.  It's not fair to the car that I really wanted a sports car and it can never be that, but that's what I really need in my life.

Remember, that whatever happens in the field still must be documented as you are touching evidence and you could very well suppress the very person you are attempting to implicate in some criminal act. 

With that being said, as others have said...bring write-blockers for both IDE/SATA drives, USB, and even SCSI. Don't forget laptop drive adapters as well in case you run into something that is older.

Given the rapid growth they're experiencing, it might be better to leave well enough alone as long as the government in Baghdad does not try to encroach on their autonomy. 

I can understand why they would want to be an independent nation, but they have to ask themselves if its worth it if it means Sulaymaniah will end up looking like Homs."

So enjoy being a kid while I'm busy here in the real world being an adult"" thing.

When I was 15/16, I was always upset that older people didn't really give me the time of day. I'd get pissed that a lot of cool concerts were only 21+. I wanted to be an adult, not treated like some teenager. But that's what I was. Some teenager. I look back now at old pictures or art projects or LiveJournal entries and shake my head. I wasn't anywhere near mature. I wasn't an adult. I was some stupid kid. I was a dramatic, angst kid. And I've changed so much since then. Hindsight is always 20/20. When our moms give us advice about how things will change and we refuse to believe anything they say because we're rebellious teenagers, that's just a part of life.

NOW TO THE PRODUCT!! It kinda smells like fresh lemons mixed with lemon starbursts so if you like those then woot! It is a squeeze dispenser and it didn't bring out much product but I soon realized only a little bit (like not even half of a pinky nail) would do absolute wonders. Which is good if you want it to last a long time. Once it starts foaming when you rub it in the lemon smell goes away and it smells like a dove bar soap so its a very mild smell. When I washed it off my skin had that squeaky clean feeling but not a tight feeling at all which I think is good. 

That being said, Its one of the better morning cleansers I have tried so in that case I recommend it.

Obviously PIV was not the only thing we did but still. And FWIW i am pretty small down there so even with piv i still felt something. Working in his favor was his ability to eat pussy.

My ex-husband was an absolute loser in bed (the joke is on his new wife, every time there is drama i laugh at how her sex life is) and he had a huge dick he had absolutely no idea how to use.

This bans disagreement. People are allowed to say in a polite manner ""I find this practice to be wrong""

tricksy_trixie,knitting,1390853497.0,"I gauge much differently when I'm going to knit a sweater vs. something like a hat or pair of mitts. A sweater is a larger time investment and fit is more important, so I take the time to do a proper swatch that is washed and blocked.

If the stated gauge is 17 sts/4 inches, for a swatch I would cast on 30 sts and knit the swatch like:

Rows 1-6: 3 garter ridges (6 rows of straight knit)

Row 7: K all sts

Row 8: K3, P24, K3

Repeat rows 7-8 until you've done at least 3 inches of the stockinette section. 

Repeat rows 1-6.

Bind off.

Wash the swatch and block it, give it the same treatment as you would the finished object. Then measure the gauge on the middle of the swatch - you should not be measuring on the garter edge or the outermost stockinette stitches. Check the row gauge too - measure 2 inches in the middle of the swatch and count the rows, multiply by two. If you're close but not exact it should be fine. If you're really off, something could be wrong. 

I'm less concerned with row gauge for most patterns, especially if the pattern says anything like ""knit the sleeve/body until it is X inches long,"" but you want a piece that is large enough to lie flat and give you ample room for measuring. Also you want to be able to measure the stitches away from things that would distort them, like curling edges or the transition from garter stitch to stockinette, so you shouldn't just cast on 17 sts and measure that.

Looking at the answer, it's slightly different with the variable reference getting put in another variable. I guess I stuck with the one variable because that's what was in the `var_dump()` that the example gave.

Looking at the example, I'm stuck at the first 2. I would not have thought of using array_map and array_walk. I've heard about those functions but I've never used them because foreach did the trick for me every time. I've never had anyone point out code efficiency to me. During my education, my stuff was graded on whether it worked on not.

And the last 2. Never heard of them.

Here's my problem: I doubt myself frequently. Did I do things as efficiently as possible? How can I be certain it actually was the most efficient way? Does it affect anything? How much time will it cost me to test all options and what will that mean for the deadline?

So I usually just go for what I know already. Why would I do research when I'm supposed to be producing with a deadline to meet?"

This steel cable is not foldable and you can see such tires at bike shops hanging from hooks in their circular shapes.

A few years ago, other materials started making an appearance in the bead instead of the steel cable notably kevlar 'cables'.  They tend to be lighter and waaaaay more flexible.

My actual views are that Israel would have to be a lot worse, politically speaking, for me to actually swing to the ""it shouldn't exist"" side. And I'm not qualified to speak about two-state or unified state theories. I've read *so* much about how they would work from advocates of both sides, and the reasons it wouldn't are equally compelling. The Middle East is not my speciality, and the more I read, the more I realize the less I know.

Maybe it means that I'm giving Israel's policies too much credit. But I don't think as an American Jew I have the qualifications to make sweeping statements what Israel *should* do other than, you know, not kill civilians or violate international law.

I guess I take an extremely dim view of people who claim to *know* what Israel should do as either completely ignorant or just antisemitic fucks precisely because of how aware I am of how clueless I am.

Guest_Acct,technology,1390854002.0,"64 bits is for really huge chunks of data.  The one time where you'd use them in a processor is for processing very large complex numbers.  In a 32 bit system, they essentially have to emulate this, and it ends up being much slower.  This is why desktop workstations for graphics professionals got the 64 bit systems first.  64 bit removes that need for what is a bottleneck in very large numbers, and gains a huge performance boost (sometimes 4x+).  In mathematical terms, it means the difference between 2^64 versus 2^32 in the amount of bits it can process in a single cycle.

Apple's core products revolve around graphics and audio.  2 major sectors that rely on 64 bit complex numbers.  iMovie, Garage Band, and the numerous photo editing apps get a giant increase in performance.  Their latest chip allows them to work natively between the core processor and the graphics coprocessors more easily and boost performance.  This is how their 2 core processor can behave twice as fast as the best multi core Android processor from last year.

Android really doesn't have a comparable solution like iMovie or Garage Band, so it ended up on the back burner and dismissed.

So if you're looking to do video, audio, or edit some photos, get an iPhone.  If you don't care and just want a touch phone, get an Android."

Will_Im_Not,SubredditDrama,1390854090.0,"&gt;Fifty-four percent of women who have abortions had used a contraceptive method (usually the condom or the pill) during the month they became pregnant. Among those women, 76% of pill users and 49% of condom users report having used their method inconsistently, while 13% of pill users and 14% of condom users report correct use.

It honestly seems like most unintended pregnancies could have been prevented with proper contraception use and education. The way to stop unintended pregnancies is with sexual education and agencies like Planned Parenthood, both of which conservatives oppose. Slashing funding for Planned Parenthood actually causes *more* unwanted pregnancies (and abortions, and babies to people who aren't prepared for it).

This seems like one of those issues where everyone is so concerned about the outcome (abortion) while completely ignoring the causes behind it."
