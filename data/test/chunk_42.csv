Lion_on_the_floor,AskReddit,1389907622.0,"No, but we did participate in the Human Mirror (whole set of twins who look alike, dressed alike mimic each other's moves to create a mirror image in public).

The latest closest thing was my sister invited me to her company's Holiday party. I arrived before she did and as soon as I ran into other people they thought I was her. I stepped out of the bathroom and some guy walking by quickly introduced his date to [my sister's name] but it was really me, so I had to introduce myself.

I also confused someone else by saying ""nice to meet you"" because they didn't register right away I was not my sister. I feel kind of awkward in social situations when I don't know anyone, but I felt like since her coworkers would mistake me for her, I had to be extra nice and on point and not be outright awkward.


EDIT -- sometimes we'll try to trick our mom with our voices over the phone. I also like to mimic her facebook pictures to make myself look like her default picture or whatever.

day_kid_older_sister,relationship_advice,1389907625.0,"My boyfriend and I have had this fight every two months of our 14 month relationship. We're going through it right now. I'm pretty much convinced that there's no way to fix a relationship that goes through this particular upset.

Setting aside all of the other concerns (it's never just CL, you're probably trolling other places online and in real life; really, you're *that* guy who needs to surf an internet forum for pussy?; lying; cheating; exposure to diseases and crazy people...), I'll ask you the same question I asked him: do you even think of her and how she'd feel when you do it?

I think browsing is cheating. It's not like you checked out the cute girl in the supermarket with nice melons. You went to a specific site for people who are soliciting sex from strangers on the internet. Personally, I think that's so much worse than IRL browsing, because there's no gray area with it. It's not something accidental or that got out of hand. You had to go there on purpose, knowing the trouble it's caused and the potential consequences.

You knew it was wrong. It already cost you. You've never addressed the real issue (which is that there is something messed up about you). You love her, but you're clearly not capable of giving her the relationship she wants. Fix yourself, then try again if she's willing. Because we both know it won't really be the last time until you work on it by yourself."

I do think microaggression is a thing, yes. My point is it can happen unknowingly and accidentally very often. My other point is that we should be careful about what we're saying. It doesn't have to be walking on eggshells to just educate yourself on oppressed groups and realize how saying things like that can be offensive. In fact, it becomes really easy and doesn't take effort to not say something of the sort.

I don't want you to interpret what I'm about to ask as being condescending; I'm asking a genuine question...Are you open to being wrong when you engage in dialogues? I ask because I know personally, in every argument, I know I need to be open to being wrong. I can be firm on arguments, but without the chance of someone being enlightened, then we're doing nothing but bickering. I hope you're open to it to. I just want you to know it kind of comes off like you're not, and I want you to be aware of that in case you desire to be someone who is pleasant to engage with. You use personal attacks and blatant aggression often, and it makes it seem like you're defending a point only, instead of engaging in a dialogue and bringing your thoughts on a matter in. I'm sure this sounds condescending to you again. It's just I would appreciate if someone let me know, so I figured you would want to know too."

I am very comfortable with my own mortality and my loved one's mortality.  When a death in my family or circle happens, I take the time to be there and be present with all the people who had a close relationship with the deceased.  I look at it not so much as mourning for me, but as an opportunity to be a good friend and family member.

The biggest burden on me is the stress of logistics.  Dealing with the funeral arrangments.  making decisions about caskets and plots and locations etc.  Making sure everyone has the info for all the happenings.  Making sure there's food, and travel and room and board for people coming from out of town etc.  Then going through their house/apartment and cleaning it out.  That's the worst part about death sometimes.  It's not just the loss, but all the crap you have to deal with at the same time you're processing the loss.  The more that can be done to take stress of the closest people the the departed, the more they are free to just deal with the personal and community aspects of the death."

AgentDL,AskMen,1389907739.0,"&gt; I told him weeks ago that I wasn't going to sleep with him until we were exclusive, and since things are definitely headed towards sex

I get that you've established a pretty serious connection between sex and exclusivity, and I think that's perfectly reasonable. Lots of people (virgins and non-) prefer to only have sex with people with whom they're in committed relationships... but the way you've worded the statement above kind of makes it sound like you want to have the exclusivity talk so you can have sex, as opposed to having the exclusivity talk so you can... be exclusive.  

The exclusivity talk should happen when you've decided you want to focus your time and energy as they pertain to relationships on this one person, and presumably when you have a reasonably good idea that he feels the same way. 

The sex should happen when you feel the urge to have sex with him and are comfortable that doing so is in line with your morals and values. 

The two definitely intersect, but you may need to consider them separately for a minute because they may be too tied together in your mind based on what you're saying. 

If you feel like things are moving toward having sex, either decide if you REALLY want to be exclusive with this person, or if you want to have sex without being exclusive and see where it goes. Don't do the first just so you can do the second because that makes no sense. 

Hope this helps.

Graphics cards do the same thing. say a 650 TI Boost is the Smart car, it gets the job done with 1 gb of vram. and think of the 780 TI as the ferrari, it could use only 1 gb of vram to get the job done, but why would it? if it has 6gb to use. so games take advantage of this and show a usage of 4-5 gb of vram on a 780 TI."

A pregnant Lyanna is no good to anyone at this point and would be trouble.  So what are two in love and misguided people to do?  Hide the pregnancy.  I don't blame either of them for the war because had the opportunity been there, they wouldn't have allowed it.

by_a_pyre_light,battlefield_4,1389907936.0,"The SRAW is the laser-guided one. You have to remain aiming at the target while the missile is in flight, because the missile follows the laser. This means, if you're really good, you can pull off amazing hits on nearly anything. On the other hand, you're exposed the whole time, it's a slower missile, and most people can't judge the distance well enough to hit moving targets.

The LAW fires like a traditional RPG/SMAW, straight to the target. When it gets within a few feet of the target, it jets up a couple of meters, the way Javelins do on takeoff in real life. In practice, it should mean the missile avoids slamming into the heaviest armor and hits the softer top of a vehicle. In practice, it does this most of the time, but sometimes it hits odd angles. 

Both the LAW and SRAW can be locked onto sniper's PLD designator signals. 

The SRAW does the most damage in the game for rocket launchers and the LAW does the least. The LAW is critically low compared to something like the SMAW or SRAW, but it reloads and fires faster.

The SMAW and RPG have a couple of other advantages as well - for distance targets, the LAW's locking doesn't work well. This makes long distance shots, like from the cliffs in Silk Road, or from the high roofs in Shanghai and Danwbreaker, difficult for the LAW. The SMAW is the fastest moving missile, which means you have to aim ahead of moving targets, but you don't have to account for as much variability as the LAW. And, the SMAW hits harder too, so you can use fewer missiles to take out a target. For these reasons, I stopped using the LAW. "

I just remember waking up, pushing myself away from my bed like it was trying to kill me, and sobbing. Not like, a tear or a tremble, I mean I had tears streaming down my face.

Never trust someone who isn't a ranger, because it took us seven hours (my mom is 55 and an inexperienced hiker). She was pissed. But it was still worth it because the trip was amazing.

Update on my mom: I had to carry her pack for the last hour, but she made it out of the canyon. She said she'd never go hiking again. A month later, she was talking about when we could go back, so I consider it a job well done."

Perhaps the afterlife isn't a simple black and white dichotomy like that? Perhaps there are shades of grey? Indeed, perhaps beyond those shades of grey, there are colors and textures? 

The assumption *starts* with the afterlife being just. We don't know what that will look like, except that it will be good for some, and not so good for others. Any specific imagery in the Bible is, strictly speaking, mere metaphor for something we don't have the capacity to understand. If the imagery seems unjust to you, it is better to reject the imagery than to reject the idea of God's Just/Gracious stance toward us. We have to *start* with that. 

And I think that ""critical thought"" is merely one of the many, many things God takes into account in his judgment, along with every other thing that could be relevant to the sum of one's life. "

At the time of the award, his confirmed score on the duck U-57 and U-552 was 28 ships for about 163,000 tons, including the American destroyer *Reuben James* and the 227-ton ASW trawler *Commander Horton*.

*Hitler's U-Boat War, pg 540*.

Considering that, at one point, she did serve as an armed ship, that could be used as a sort of *raison d'etre* to sink the ship. In the end, if the opportunity presented itself, there was no reason to not sink a perceived enemy combatant.

My anxiety is so internalized and separate from logical mental processes that I actually experience anxiety AS stomach upset.  It's extremely difficult to tell the difference between anxiety and 'real' stomach issues.

What I've had to do is just try and stop obsessing about trying to tell the difference, and go about my business as normally as possible until a symptom PHYSICALLY stops me.  Being *worried* about a symptom physically stopping me doesn't count.  If I'm unsure about whether something is physically stopping me, it isn't.  I do whatever I have to do anyway, no matter how stressed I feel.

I'm not advocating this as a long-term solution - it gets exhausting fighting after awhile.

Plus, if there are things you can do to assuage your worries that aren't too time-consuming (or at least aren't more time consuming than constantly worrying) then do them.  Take a home pregnancy test, for example.

TryUsingScience,Norse,1389908165.0,"I'm not sure how that practice is relevant. Thor's hammer can only be wielded with the help of a specific set of gloves, and he can also use it to bring his goats back from the dead. Resurrecting goats is clearly magic, and we know it's not just symbolic (any more than anything else is) because the reason Thor ends up with Thjalfi as a servant is because Thjalfi eats the marrow from one of the goats' leg bones, causing that goat to have a limp ever afterwards.

Thor's unhappiness in most of those stories has nothing to do with Loki. Utgard-Loki's trickery certainly isn't Loki's fault, nor is Thrym's. The fact remains that variations of ""Thor's companion"" are seen as kennings for Loki.

Thor calls Odin ergi during a flyting, which is when everyone calls everyone else ergi. I'd like to see an example of Thor calling Odin ergi at any other time. Your example of Thor's dislike of the crossdressing plan actually supports my point- it's things that aren't manly that Thor dislikes, not magic. Because crossdressing is not inherently magical, despite what some very talented drag queens may lead you to believe.

Not sure if you saw my edit, but in *Skaldskaparmal* Thor is visited by a wise-woman named Groa who uses magic songs to try and remove the stone Hrungnir lodged in his head. While Groa is doing her magic Thor entertains her by telling her stories about his adventures with her husband. That's a pretty clear example of Thor being okay with magic."

If you put your palm facing the direction of travel, your arm has a tendency to get pulled back, vibrate around, etc.. If you put it sideways, palm parallel to Earth, there's a lot less drag.

A periscope, in its initial phases, was very similar to that. The two were basically unsupported, long rods that created turbulence on the boat, causing vibrations. These vibrations, at I believe more than 3-4 kt's underwater, would cause the periscope to be rendered useless.

This was dampened, after learning of its faults, by using an extension bracket to reinforce its unsupported length, and redesigning to minimize forward hydraulic resistance. This, while not completely removing the vibration, reduced it to a point of usability. 

So to answer your question shortly and sweetly, yes it was stabilized, eventually, but still vibrated."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389908267.0,"&gt; Source?

Look around you. We've had charities for forever but it hasnt been until we instituted real systematic change that we've improved.

&gt;What I am doing is pointing out the disingenuousness of statements of the morality of increased safety nets by people who propose to use other people's money to do it. If you truly care about the poor, you help the poor. If you want to pretend to care about the poor, you claim to support policies that take from others to do so. What a great deal! You get all of the accolades and don't have to devote any of your own time and resources!

What makes the money other peoples'? The rules we propose for society. Change the rules, and you can change who owns what.

&gt;What actually allows us to escape the state of nature is technology, not any particular social order.

All the tech in the world makes no difference if we're stuck in old ways of thinking. And that's where I think capitalism is beginning to and will get worse at holding us back. It's a system that relies on scarcdity, and I think in late stage post industrial capitalism, it will serve as a way to justify the rich having all the wealth, while promoting scarcity among everyone else.

&gt;We can't terraform planets yet. We have the engineering understanding to travel at 10%-20% of c, but haven't developed that sufficiently to really go to other star systems. Nor have we completely figured out how to sustain humans in space for very long periods of time. Beyond that, we haven't found suitable alternate planets for habitation yet. We haven't figured out how to get an indefinite lifespan yet.

When we go into space, we'll have to start over. Space will be harder for people, not easier. Because space will bring back the scarcity we're currently eliminating. Space isn't relevant to my arguments.

&gt;These are the challenges we need to complete before we worry about equalizing shares. You see, once we do this, it costs us nothing to equalize resources. Until then, it makes sense to try and get there as rapidly as possible.

I'm also not talking complete equalization. Don't confuse me with a communist or something. I just think we can become MORE equal, and reverse this tide of massiver inequality, where there are becoming two americas...one for the rich and the other for the poor. 

&gt;Wrong. Only technology moves us forward. All policy does is reorganize our current resources.

And once again. WE NEED BALANCE. Seriously, **** your ""progress"" if the overwhelming majority of people don't benefit from it. Seriously."

Divination is very much a part of seidr as my understanding goes. I hear seidh and spe used almost interchangeably a lot of the time, although maybe that's just laziness. It's almost exclusively women (and Odin) who do divinatory things in the lore.

On the other hand, a rich person building a new highly-automated factory for $100 million would pay an additional $100 million in VAT. If he tried to circumvent it by importing instead of manufacturing domestically, he'd end up paying the VAT on imports.

If you make $50k, and get $15k, you're still paying twice as much on your non necessities. Say you spend $15k on necessities. Well, your $50k is now devalued to $25k because of taxes.

It's a really bad policy dude. 100% tax?! Are you nuts?1 I see zero reason to go this route when we can target income."

jezztek,AskWomen,1389908634.0,"Hmmmm, I don't know if you can dismiss the stereotype so easily from that data. One one hand you are right in that sex doesn't ""die"" after marriage, if you want to avoid going completely sexless marriage seems to be the way to go. 

First of all I think this stereotype is largely propagated by men who are sexually frustrated in their marriages, and they have obviously exaggerated their experiences, and then other men have repeated these exaggerations as gospel truth out of fear they would suffer the same fate. But I also think there is *some* kernel of truth in there that the data supports. 

I remember from a research paper I wrote from back when I was in school (over 10 years ago, so perhaps the data is outdated) that most men reported their ideal sexual frequency to be multiple times per week (often daily), so if having sex multiple times a week is necessary for a man to feel satisfied then according to this data having a partner but not getting married seems to be very much the best way to achieve this goal (at least for all men who aren't in their twenties or seventies, with the 20s and 70s being the far edge of either side of the studied age brackets). Looking at the percentages that have sex multiple times a week we get the following results:

age 30-39 - Married: 32.6% - partnered: 45.5%  (being unmarried but partnered increases your chances of having sex multiple times a week by 39.5% in your 30s)

age 40-49 - Married: 23.6% - partnered: 36.8% (being unmarried but partnered increases your chances of having sex multiple times a week by 55.9% in your 40s)

age 50-59 - Married: 16.1% - partnered: 23.5% (being unmarried but partnered increases your chances of having sex multiple times a week by 45.9% in your 50s)

age 60-69 - Married: 9.5% - partnered: 40.9% (being unmarried but partnered increases your chances of having sex multiple times a week by 430.5% in your 60s)

So if you are in your 30s-60s and you need sex multiple times a week to avoid feeling sexually frustrated then the reality, according to this data, is marrying your partner increases your chances of being sexually unsatisfied. But on the flip side you increase your chances of getting *some* sexual activity, even if it's not nearly the frequency you desire. "

FYI. It depends on what state you live in, but Alimony is not a requirement and it is generally not modifiable. Where I live, the wife must ask for alimony up front, she can't come ask for it later. she also can't ask for more money in the future. There is no formula to how much it needs to be and it is possible to set a time limit on how long it lasts.  Alimony usually stops if the wife gets remarried. In my case we agreed to a number and set a time limit (5 years). If you can't agree on the number, that's when the court might get involved and force you into something. We went to a mediator and were able to agree on most things.

**Meghan &amp; Jay, Weirdass Love Story**

My husband Jay (/u/MarbhDamhsa) and I met when we were like 11 years old on Neopets.com. I was a fairly well-known guild-owner (yep, I'm so cool) and he was planning to mooch off of my riches and fame. He talked to me pretty often just trying to gain favor and so on and rise up the ranks of my guild. We kid-flirted a lot and I had a giant internet crush on him.

When we were 12 he flew out here (Las Vegas to Boston) for the first time. Why did our parents let that happen? Who knows. Then I had a giant in-person crush on him! He stayed for a week and went home and I pined and went back to my (at the time, really sketchy and inappropriate) life.

He stayed with me for those holidays through my birthday and we kind of danced around the situation. He lived far away, I had a (terrible, too-old) boyfriend, blah blah blah. He went home.

That fall I finally broke up with (terrible, too-old) boyfriend and was musing about what I was going to do next to Jay over AIM. I had always talked to him about relationships and stuff, so I thought it would be normal to muse about. Some people who have talked to me know that I have this really messed up friend who I refer to as love-of-my-life Gil, and that was who I was kind of musing over.

Our AIM conversation went kind of like this:

Me: And I guess I can finally just go be with Gil. Like he wants. It's fine.

Jay: Yeah, don't do that.

Me: Hehe I know it's bad and dangerous and going to lead to inevitable heartache and sorrow, and probably imprisonment, but I'm going to do it anyways *hair twirl* (exaggeration but not totally inaccurate)

Jay: I can't deal with hearing about you giving all your love and time to people that treat you like shit anymore.

Jay: So do whatever you're going to do.

Jay: But I love you and it's killing me.

*Jay signed off at dark thirty in the morning*

So of course I swooned, did not date love-of-my-life Gil, and spent the next several years in a long-distance relationship. [This](http://i.imgur.com/uNmGT.jpg) is us on the beach when we were like... probably 14-15.

We weren't and aren't monogamous, and I'm really primarily interested in women... but *man*, that man.

We got married on October 10, 2010! My wedding pictures are my fat pictures, but whatever, [here's the wedding](http://i.imgur.com/58rJa.jpg)!"

DrDalenQuaice,gamedesign,1389908804.0,"You're missing one: balance by ignorance. In strategy games I find one of the most powerful elements of balance is when two options seem equally viable, and you have to find out which is in actuality. This requires me as a player to either pick one and go with it, or devote a portion of my resources and time to discovering what works best.

Usually this is implemented in maps. For example, in a map with a lot of water, the sooner I develop ships, the better off I am. That may not be so true on a land-heavy map. But I have to learn that first. I have to spend time exploring, becoming more and more sure that yes in fact this is a water-heavy map.

To implement this you need random inputs (such as a randomly generated map). Other random inputs could work too. The player who chooses to bring only a limited number of weapons with him on a quest be gambling that the level contains no fire-resistant enemies, only to find that it in fact contains only fire-resistant enemies. Give up, or carry on with your fire-based weapons.

In essence, leave it unbalanced, but differently each time so the player gets to discover the unbalances for themselves over and over again. players love to feel smart by feeling like they've ""figured out"" the unbalances in a game. But it dies in replays. As long as those balances are re-randomized on each new play, the discovery of which inbalances are in play *this time* is fun in its own way."

The Coast Guard had that as a duty, mainly: to guard the coast.

From another comment in this thread:

The most important of these commands was the Eastern Sea Frontier, stretching from the Canadian Border to North Carolina. It was commanded by King's classmate, Adolphus Andrews.
Andrews, while being the biggest, actually had no warships under his command, and had to call on the Atlantic fleet for warships in case of a U-boat attack. The help was nonexistent-the Atlantic Fleet was preoccupied with escorting convoys.
So, Andrews did the best he could and assembled a ragtag fleet on twenty ships:
7 Coast Guard Cutters (165' Dione and six 125' ships) 4 prewar 110' Sub Chasers 3 200' Eagle Class subchasers 2 1905 gunboats 4 large converted yachts.
In actuality, only the 16 knot Dione had any sort of chance to engage a U-boat.
Andrews also had no aircraft, the U-boats greatest deterrence, at his command. He eventually was able to get his hands onto blimps, which was commissioned as Combat Squadron 12. They flew 45 ASW patrols and six convoy escort missions in January 1942.


The cutters were also used in convoys, as escorted, and performed admirably. As mentioned, the Escanaba was sunk June 13th, 1943. She performed admirably during the war, mainly on patrol duties."

jianadaren1,hardware,1389909045.0,"It's really interesting when you consider why they do. ""Fan-death"" is a euphemism for suicide in the same way that ""gone to a better place"" is a euphemism for death in the West. Those euphemisms help dullen the shame and pain associated with suicide and death.

However, the byproduct of those euphemisms is that the less socially intelligent people (mostly children) understand them literally, so in order to get everybody on the same page culturally, a useful delusion is created. In Korea it's the ideas that fans kill people. Here, it's the idea that there's a heaven. 

Then stuff kind of snowballs and the delusions get more sophisticated to make it more coherent (when children ask how fans kill people Koreans make shit up about cutting molecules in half and when children ask us about how they can get to this awesome place we make shit up about needing to be a good person [and not killing yourself]). But as long as the delusion doesn't get people to make bad decisions then it persists (it's not causing much harm when Koreans turn off their fans or when we encourage people to be good people and stay alive).

It only backfires when the delusion starts to create more problems than it solves (for example the Aztec delusion of human sacrifice to appease the Gods really got out of hand when [Tlacaelel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlacaelel) bought his own bullshit and decided that killing more people would help, or when the [Xhosa destroyed all their food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Cape_Colony_from_1806_to_1870#Xhosa_cattle-killing_movement_and_famine_.281854-1858.29) in the belief that this would bring supernatural awesomeness). When that happens the society either collapses or is defeated (Aztecs and Xhosas) or revolts against the beliefs (religious wars, reformations, conversions, philosophical movements, atheism).

Basically fan-death is a semi-religious thing. The intellectually smart know it to be false, the intellectually slow believe it to be true, and the socially smart know it to be useful."

""Any punt that is blocked and does not cross the line of scrimmage can be recovered and advanced by either team. However, if offensive team recovers it must make the yardage necessary for its first down to retain possession if punt was on fourth down.""

""The kicking team may never advance its own kick even though legal recovery is made beyond the line of scrimmage. Possession only.""

I don't see it in that rules page, but based on the Leon Lett play from back in the day, I believe a partially blocked kick that crosses the line of scrimmage is equivalent to a shanked punt or any other punt - it needs to be touched again by the receiving team before it becomes live (but even then, it can't be advanced per the second quote above)."

e9r0q2eropqweopo,beyondthebump,1389909095.0,"So you are trying to find solutions to a bunch of things all at once here (small for apartment, can go in cabs, flat). I personally was not able to find something that fit all of these criteria, and for me the one that had to go was flat. If the baby doesn't spend that much time in the seat, the flatness is not as important.

I have the Britax system (B safe and B agile) and someone loaned me the flat attachment, and it did not get used at all because:
1. there are no straps, so if I am out walking and the stroller tips because I am clumsy the baby would just go rolling out 
2. it can't be used as a carseat, so it is not as flexible
3. it's huge (long mainly)

For me the baby spending slightly less time flat did not seem as important as having her strapped in when we were out and about. 

I was horrified by how big all the infant strollers were in the store, but I have really loved having a travel system. It's great to be able to move the seat from the stroller to the car and back. I have traveled a lot with it on planes trains and taxis and it has worked well everywhere. She is 6 months now and I dread the day she gets too big for it, because I don't know what we are supposed to do about a carseat when we take taxis. If anyone has any advice on this I would love to hear it! We often take taxis on days when we are doing a lot of walking and have nowhere to ditch extra stuff. Uber doesn't seem to offer carseats, unfortunately.

I have friends who prefer baby carriers over strollers, but I actually feel a lot more encumbered using a carrier. You have the baby strapped to you, and then you have to carry the diaper stuff also. With the stroller you can just stick your bag in the bottom and carry nothing on you at all. This is basically just a matter of preference, unless it's a trip where you need a carseat in a car you don't own, and then the travel system is pretty much the only way to go.

FYI the last time I checked it is technically legal to bring a baby in a taxi in NYC without a car seat. Don't do this though."

Your the same size as me pretty much, I'm around 200-210 and 6 foot.

Just get some hard bushings and you'll be set.  

Start out with an 8.0 you will know if you want wider or smaller from there, I stepped it down to 7.75 but am stepping it up to 7.875 for my next deck...

Some people prefer wider decks, even people who weigh 150, so weight and height doesn't have a lot to do with deck width.

It's all how much the deck responds, how it responds to stuff like flickign for kickflips (small boards spin faster, larger boards require a harder flick to get same amount of spin), and the amount of stability you need.  For street skating 7.75 - 8.0 is good, and if you want to skate ramps and more vert stuff like miniramps I would go between 8.0 and 8.5 if I were you.

Once you start skating and cruising around a little bit on your first complete you will see how sturdy a real skateboard is.

We have no control over foreign IDs. There are hundreds of different drivers licences and IDs in this world. Expecting sellers to know what they all look like is a ludicrous notion. The law is designed for simplicity and for the New Zealand market. The negative consequence of a tourist being inconvenienced is eclipsed by the negative social outcomes that could happen with no limitation on IDs. If we accepted every ID at face value you'd have 16 and 17 year olds the country over printing their own IDs. How would we be supposed to know if the ID is faked.

ChangloriousBastard,nba,1389909444.0,"&gt; It's deflationary

It's deflationary not by practice, but by design.  In all of time, there will be no more than 2,099,999,997,690,000 units of bitcoin available.  If you look at the amount of bitcoin that can be mined and multiply it by the maximum divisibility of BTC, you're left with that money.  That's a big number, but it's finite.  

If we use M1 as a guide, there is about 2.6 trillion USD in existence in one form or another.  If the USD is divisible down to the cent, there's about 10% less divisibility in US currency than there is in BTC

That's a good thing, right?  Bitcoin has more divisibility than USD?  But wait, [M1 has been growing at an exponential rate!](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/M1/)  

Assuming it continues to grow at an exponential rate, USD will be more divisible than BTC in the next century.  When that happens, small transactions will be limited to the minimum divisibility of BTC.  If demand grows for BTC, BTC value will rise but the relative cost of goods won't change.  That creates deflation as the value of BTC can do nothing but go up.  

&gt;Limited supply and high volatility

If BTC is deflationary, it is more valuable as a commodity than a currency.  If BTC is treated as a commodity it will be prone to volatility.  

&gt; 51% Attack.  Let's say that for 1 hour there's a computer network with 51% of the hash rate.  Let's say they're malicious.  They could theoretically ""double dip"" fail to validate legitimate transactions and control the new supply of BTC.  For that 1 hour, the bitcoin economy would be in chaos.  The smart move would be to sit out, as transactions would be dangerous.  People who were on the wrong end of the transaction stick would question the security of that economy.  It wouldn't ruin BTC, but it would scare the shit out of anyone that depends on BTC.  That's all it takes for an economy to fail.

&gt; Bitcoin security / protection

It's possible, but like you said it's not easy.  Added security comes at the expense of flexibility and ease of use.  Right now, those two features are advantages of bitcoin; sacrificing them makes bitcoin less appealing."

Cykuta,todayilearned,1389909465.0,"Yes, The Hobbit movies are not as good as Lord of the Rings movies. And yes, I see ways in which they could have been better, way better. But - to grab the nearest example - I liked Tauriel, as a character I found her to fit the story very well and to be necessary, because without someone to show what is good about elves (when Thranduil shows us all that is bad about them) they seem like a completely different species than the elves we've seen in the trilogy. So, seeing how everyone is intent on skinning her alive, the modifications I would have made to the film would make it better for me, but probably not to any bigger portion of the public.

And that's the trouble - there is this huge public out there that has expectations. I don't know where you live, but around here, when Fellowship of the Ring came out, people weren't excited. People were wary and cautious and expecting a failure, insisting it was impossible to translate Tolkien into film. So the Fellowship only had to raise its quality above zero and it was already rad. It's the opposite for Hobbit: everyone expected it to be wonderful, so of course it isn't. It's kind of like when you need to cast Helen of Troy and suddenly random dudes everywhere complain about some breathtakingly gorgeous actress, because they've been spoiled by years of watching impeccable beauties everywhere and expect someone superhuman to even get their interest.

Not that I mean you personally. I fully understand your point of view and I wasn't accusing you of any malice at all.

I'm really interested in the gender question and how it has affected the structure of society. I really want to know what drives the notion of gender identity in ourselves. I hope I didn't offend you with my post, I am genuinely open-minded about these issues and want to make sure my approach to them is as informed and fair as possible.

I'm sure it's a result of my own socialisation and ignorance of the experience's of others but I still wonder where the ""mind of one sex in the body of the other"" notion finds its cause. I believe in the plasticity of the brain and when I am told that researchers have found that the structure of men and women's brains are different, I don't want to rule out that this could be due to their social development throughout their lives. Thus, I wonder if indeed the brain in a transgender person is different merely because of their different perception of themselves.

/u/Lluxx above claims that the brain difference claim from research is what sets people suffering from GID aside from those with other physical dysmorphic disorders. Because of what I just said, I am still slightly skeptical and so I wanted to know: If we lived in an ideal world where gender wasn't as strongly defined and people did not have strict roles based on their genitalia, do you think you would have been able to fit in without transitioning? If you could simply tell the world that you identify as a woman and they would treat you as such, would you be comfortable? "

Pairing: dubbed as wingest. (There's no kissing or anything like that, Sam just touches Dean's feathers). 


Rating: M, mostly for language. 


Summary: It's Halloween, Dean's been given wings, and Sam will never be the same.


Commentary: This is just an awesome little fic with some crack, humor and a *teeny* bit of angst. Oldie, but goodie. Was written in 2006 and has that nice season 1 feel to it. One of the first not-completely-gen fics I read, so it holds a special place in my heart. Most of her stuff is actually just case-fic, so I still recommend her to folks that prefer a hurt/comfort type of story with no wincest-y elements (I'm talking to you, stophauntingme).  


[Comfortable](https://archiveofourown.org/works/410715) by kototyph


Paring: Sassy


Rating: General Audiences 


Summary: Crazy!Cas doesn't need to sleep, but he likes to. He also likes to use Sam as his bed.


Commentary: It's just as adorable as it sounds. Set during season 7, after Cas showed up naked and covered in bees on the Impala, so Dean's still a tad miffed. This fic made me want to find someone to cuddle with. Completely full of schmoop, humor, crack, all that good stuff. 


[Trick Your Lovers](https://archiveofourown.org/works/976896?view_adult=true) by geckoholic


Pairing: Abaddon/Dean


Rating: Explicit 


Summary: He's out of options, she's offering a solution. Warnings for coercion and therefore dubious consent. Some humiliation and painplay.


Commentary: Was written before season 9 aired. Gosh, I love Abaddon so much. Does that make me a bad person? "

I agree with /u/joanna70 that you may be shallow, so I suggest when you're back at Nordstrom you try Seductive Comfort in a larger cup size, as well as the Natori Feathers. I find that Betsey Johnson bands run VERY stretchy, so when you wear it in the correct size, it should feel much looser than the Seductive Comfort, and I don't suggest getting one unless you love it because it'll probably wear out quickly. My best fitting bra thus far is a kensie corselette(sp?) in a 32C (sister size to my 30D). The 32 band is too big, but the corselette had firm boning that keeps the bra from riding up.

This isn't to say that Reid didn't do a good job, but I don't think he necessarily deserves all the credit for the 9-win swing.

In pre-season I put together estimates for how each team could expect to do based on the talent on their roster (using PFFs positional evaluations to assess that).

First, turn the broiler of your oven on.  
Beat your eggs and run them through you friendly neighborhood blender. This seems silly but you get a smoother end product. 
In a 6-7 inch egg pan (get one with a heat resistant/proof handle) add the fat of your choice, I use clarified butter.
Next, get your pan/fat hot enough until the fat starts to shimmer. 
Add your eggs to you pan, using a silicone spatula mix your eggs quickly over the heat. The goal if this is to get your eggs to tighten up slowly OR make small egg curds as it cooks. Think scrambled eggs. Now, it'll take a few times to get the hang of this but at a certain point stop mixing  and let the egg at the bottom of the pan set - this will be the outside of your ""omelette"", you want to have the bottom to set flat. The egg on top should still be liquid, place your pan under the broiler until just before they're set - at the is point add any cheese, if  you want. If no cheese then put back in the broiler until they're set but still soft.

&gt; I do think microaggression is a thing, yes. My point is it can happen unknowingly and accidentally very often.

Then how is it aggression of any kind?

&gt; My other point is that we should be careful about what we're saying.

How careful, exactly? Proponents of the 'microaggression' say we can't ask people questions directly as equals, no, we've got to go away and  'educate ourselves' about the intricate social hierarchy of attributing privilege points before we can even know which people we're allowed to ask questions, let alone what questions we can ask.  

And how are we to 'educate ourselves'? By reading particular authoritarian-left political blogs and woozled sociological papers, and absorbing the interpretations of ideologues, rather than interacting with the individual people *right in front of us.* This whole 'microaggression' thing and the ideology surrounding it is very prescriptive-linguistic, very preachy, very guilt-tripping, very erroneous and very socially controlling. I argue against it because it is a suffocating superstition with negative social repercussions, some of which I've witnessed in person because it has unfortunately infiltrated post-secondary education.

&gt; It doesn't have to be walking on eggshells to just educate yourself on oppressed groups and realize how saying things like that can be offensive.

Women aren't an ""oppressed group"" anywhere we outnumber men in post-secondary education, that is, the Western world at the very least.  I am not part of an oppressed group, yet a bunch of ideologues are telling other people what they're allowed to say to me, even if that thing is completely or almost completely innocuous, because some women (hypersensitive women who have likely been taught to be hypersensitive by the ideology in question) might take offense, as though mere offense counts as some kind of harm (lead me to the fainting couch!). This *does indeed* constitute others telling others to walk on eggshells in my presence, because of my sex, thus attempting to *speak on my behalf* because of my sex. That is sexist. That is misogynistic, due to the way it paints women. And no I'm not focusing on only myself, because I know for a fact that I am far from alone here.

And even if I was part of an oppressed group -- why, again, to these social justice warriors get to decide for everyone else what to say, and guilt-trip everyone else *out* of saying, things that are perceived by some as offensive? Why do these 'oppressed' groups need someone else to stand up for them individually in everyday conversation? 

See where we agree here? Everyone is different, we agree on this. Many if not most people will be *fine* with a thing deemed potentially offensive by the SJWs. 

Understanding that everyone is different, why err on the side of non-communication and thus stratification as proponents of the 'microaggression' expect us to, when we could instead err on the side of communication with the potential to cause a bit of offense, and encourage the practice of a little thing called 'open-mindedness'?

&gt; Are you open to being wrong when you engage in dialogues?

Of course I am.  It's a basic rule (and courtesy, and *goal*) of discourse. But the silly thing here is that even if I wasn't, I would say I am, because anyone would, so there's not really much of a point in asking the question, lol.

&gt;You use personal attacks and blatant aggression often, 

I don't use personal attacks that often, though I'm occasionally guilty of it because fuck me if it isn't deserved. What I never do is base an argument on a personal attack, unlike many I encounter. That's the part that matters. But what do you mean by blatant aggression? Swearing and colour? 

&gt;  I just want you to know it kind of comes off like you're not,

Probably because I haven't really been wrong much if at all. I'm confident in my confidence, you see. I'm pretty good at being able to tell where I lack knowledge.

&gt; and it makes it seem like you're defending a point only, instead of engaging in a dialogue and bringing your thoughts on a matter in. 

What exactly is the difference here that concerns you? Making and defending points is *how* to engage in dialogue and bring in one's thoughts on a matter.

Whom ever you heard this from should be immediately labeled as an idiot and removed from your list of ""reputable sources"".

KNOX is ""secure-boot"" type of bootloader.  We ALL got that part.  It is a new hurdle that we will eventually overcome in order to root and flash roms on our phone.  This is the cat and mouse game we have played since the iPhone was first released.  It appears to match signatures for /boot files and the kernel, except when the user space (part of Android System) trips a counter and it refuses boot at all.

As for the KNOX application space, it is a dual-boot, side-by-side type of system so that IT professionals can implement the ""bring your own device"" system on YOUR personal cell phone for corporate use.  So you ""launch"" the KNOX space from your personal cell phone and go into a corporate controlled area (apps, data, etc).  You then leave it and go back to personal land.  Interesting idea, not sure if it will take off....

If you don't like this idea, then don't hand your personal cell phone over to your employer for ""use"", pay the monthly fee for it, and otherwise go through the many hoops and sign-ups to download and install it (NO this can not be ""accidentally"" accomplished).

Anyways, usually boats were either found on the surface, sighting their periscopes, or detecting them with sonar. Eventually, as the war dragged on, radar was developed that allowed the hood of the periscope to be ""seen"" at ranges around 4000M, which was monumental. Also, Hunter-Killer groups developed, which were roaming packs of destroyers and possibly a small carrier that would search for Uboats and either outright destroy them through depth charging, exhaustion, or force them to surface and attempt to capture them.

The U-505 was captured in such a fashion."

SharkMolester,Guitar,1389909819.0,"I'm not sure why a solid state amp would have two volume knobs *shrug* but on a tube amp, one controls the preamp wattage which influences how dirty the tone is, and the master volume sets the power stage wattage which when set high enough makes the tone 'break up'.

If you're using a solid state amp you want to leave the volume knobs on your guitar all the way on.  If you're using a tube amp, changing the volume will have an affect on the tone in the same way the preamp volume knob does.

Guitars almost always have two pickups, even three, because the closer to the bridge you get, the more treble there is.  So your neck pickup is more mid range and your bridge pickup is high end.  Neck pickup is usually used for rhythm and bridge for lead.

You want to set the tone knobs on your amp to whatever sounds best to you, the tone knob on your guitar cuts high frequency.

Gain gives the signal more voltage which basically compresses the tone.

You'll generally want some type of effect turned on when you're playing, as a 'dry' guitar signal, even a distorted or overdriven one could use a little help to sound full.  Whether that's reverb, chorus, delay, compression, phasing, a cocked wah, ect, depends on what you like.  Guitarists use footswitches because ^ ^ ^

I would actually argue that the high-school egg drop contest gets a lot of things right.  You are presented with a general problem and a clear objective then have the freedom to explore your own solution.  Everyone starts off on a fairly level playing field and because you have to draw from your own abilities and creativity, doing well nets you more personal satisfaction.  Maybe you had a different experience.  Also, my poor egg...

Exactly.  I don't think the ""big dogs"" have much interest in helping further the open-source idea so they aren't likely to be our sponsors.  It's not so much ""screw them"" as it is a fundamental incompatibility.  They take a different approach to development and innovation.

I really like the idea of a bounty-style website.  You could cruise around looking at different problems and challenges and if there's one that interests you, take a stab at a solution.  It's up to you how much time and effort you want to put in which can be preferable to contract work and could maybe even focus on collaboration for shared reward.

Well, I would counter that that has more to do with the company culture &amp; poor management, not ""at will"" itself.

I get what you're saying about ppl not being able to afford losing their jobs immediately. Keeping a poor performer or an employee causing issues also creates problems of its own across a team, on projects, with customers, etc. 

Unfortunately, there is no easy answer. Most companies have termination processes, though, to protect themselves from wrongful termination suits. Performance plans, warning systems, etc. But again, that's up to the company and not enforced by law.

Their currency was pegged to the USD and it reduced their ability to compete with other Asian economies who were able to sell cheap goods in the marketplace.  China became a dominant exporter because they were able to devalue their currency and make their products more appealing to the world market.  Hong Kong would have loved to be able to devalue their currency to compete.  Instead they went into an economic slump.  

Finite supply is an antiquated idea that's not really grounded in solid reasoning.  Economies with fixed money supplies have either collapsed or abandoned their currency in favor of a floating currency.

They say life is short. I guess that depends on your life span. For me, life is long, and I like to savor every minute of it. 


I was born from a candle. A little flame, wearing away at the wax beneath me. I sat on a table, surrounded by food and drinks. The younger humans had been taken upstairs already, but an older human sat at the end of the table. Her head in her hand. Checking her phone every few seconds. She had been like this for a while, I had already melted nearly a fourth of the candle I was sitting on. She perked up at the sound of a door opening, and I felt a draft blow through the halls and push me away gently. She stood up as the human man stumbled into the room we were in. We waited expectantly. 


""Jeanie I-"" He cut off, fidgeting with his jacket and rubbing his head before finally shrugging. The human woman, Jeanie, grit her teeth and crossed her arms. 


""So. Does she have a name?"" She spat at him. He looked up, hesitating before looking confused. He walked towards Jeanie, reaching to her. 


""Baby, what are you talking about?"" he said gently, starting to pull her into an embrace.


""Don't touch me! Don't you fucking touch me."" She started throwing her hands at him as he desperately tried to pull her in.

Finally, she pushed him off of her, he tripped backwards and caught himself on the table. I shook and began to tip. The candle I was perched on hit the table with a dull thud and the humans began to shout at each other. Wax began to suffocate me, I climbed as high as I could, but couldn't get away fast enough. Jeanie ran upstairs and the human man followed, both still shouting. By now I was simply a blue nub at the end of the wick. I was so hot and yet so cold. I needed to survive, to reach out and ignite myself again. 


I reached for the table and missed. I was melting some of the wax now, getting a little bigger. I reached again. Miss. 


One more time, I thought and leaped, grabbing hold of a thin, fabric placemat. It resisted, but soon I took it all in, spreading across its surface and devouring it. It felt so good to be big! I wanted more I began to grab hold of anything I could, pulling it in. I was suddenly so hungry. I needed more. I spread across the length of the table. I heard a door slam upstairs, and more shouting. 


Was Jeanie ok? I had spent all evening with her, I began to worry about her and the human male. I decided to go, check on them. I worked my way down the legs of the table and across the carpeted floor. I got to the foot of the stairs. A muffled voice said something, it sounded alarmed. A door opened, I began to climb the stairs. One step, two steps...The human male ran to the top step, he became pale when he saw me. I raged on, and he sprinted off pulling Jeanie from the bedroom while shouting. She looked ok, but I had to make sure. Five steps, six steps. They ran into separate rooms, the male human emerged with a small girl human, she held her teddy bear, and stared at me, eyes wide. Eleven steps, twelve steps. I was almost there. Jeanie opened the door of the other room, ushering the human male and child in. She shrieked when she saw me. 


No! No, no! I'm trying to save you! I pressed on until I got to the door. I pressed against it, but it didn't take me in quite like the carpet. I kept pushing, hearing the muted sounds of the family behind the door. 


""Jack!"" The male human cried, ""Jack wheres the emergency ladder?"" 


""Be careful opening the window!"" Jeanie's lovely voice rang out. I pushed harder, the door began to crack with heat. 


""Emily, please. PLEASE go down the ladder...No baby, Ill get you a new bear. Just GO!"" 


""Craig! the door!"" Jeanie, I thought, I'm coming, I'll protect you. 


Finally I engulfed the door. The breeze from the open window fed me and I quickly swallowed the whole room. But Jeanie. Where was Jeanie? I dove out the open window, watching her flee with the rest of the family.


No...No! Why would she run from me?! I spent my whole life looking after her. In my rage I continued climbing across the house. I crackled and burned. Jeanie! Jeanie, I love you! I only wanted to save you. I heard sirens and felt the house beginning to fall away beneath me. Jeanie stared at me in horror.


I felt a sting of cold behind me. Water rushed over me, drowning me. The house caved in and I sizzled and hissed under the cold spray. I fought back, but found myself drowning. I shrunk smaller and smaller, I was so small now, so cold. 


I looked up at Jeanie as she buried her head in the human mans chest. 


Jeanie...I love you...shhhhh....

The action was really terrible on it at first, there was atrocious blade play that's now only minor blade play, the thumb stud isn't chamfered at all and it shreds your thumb opening it, but the ergonomics are great, aesthetics are great, and it's starting to break in. 

A 3.5"" S35VN DLC coated blade with titanium blasted scales and a one-position pocket clip.

**A LITTLE UPDATE:**  It's getting a lot smoother, and I've gotten rid of almost all of the blade play.  Here's what I did:  

* Took the knife apart, and pieced it all out

* Wiped up all the oil in the knife and left it dry (I heard nylatron washers work better dry)

* Put knife back together; I first put in the second screw (between pivot and screw near lanyard hole) and tightened it really hard, then the pivot which I tightened almost all the way, then the lanyard hole area screw

* Putting the knife together in these steps removed almost all horizontal blade play, and made the knife very smooth

* Thumbstud is still fucking up my thumb, I might do something about this.

After all this, I would definitely recommend this knife to someone if they are willing to get past the break-in period and if they are willing to deal with the aggressive thumb stud.  On another note, the knife design reminds me of the Calavera Cutlery El Patron."

&gt; I used to go to Mark Driscoll's church Mars HIll.

You have my honest sympathy. That man is spiritually and emotionally abusive, and was probably a factor in your rejection of God.

&gt; To me almost all forms of Christianity seems exclusionary, if only as far as they insist God likes their faith better then other faith traditions.

Ah, yes. The Exclusionary/Inclusivist dichotomy/tension. On the one hand, you couldn't be more wrong. And on the other hand, you're absolutely right. [see what I did there?]  

The plain fact is that some ways of living and religious traditions **are** worse than other ways of living and religious traditions. Which they are isn't important yet. But merely observing that one ought to have an exclusionary stance toward the destructive forms of Christianity should show us this. The key is to reject only what is bad, not merely what is different. Although, of course, that's easier said than done :). I honestly see *most* (not all!) forms of Islam to be destructive. 

And the same holds identically true in critical thinking as well. You must reject bad ideas and poor reasoning. You may attempt to correct it if you can, but at the end of the day, you must reject it bad ideas and poor reasoning. 

On the OTHER hand, [insert all the positive things you already know about being Inclusivist]. 

And once again, the same holds identically true in critical thinking as well. You must always be looking for new ideas and ways of thinking and stories, not only because it is a joy to do so as human beings, but because if we don't, we end up in a very tiny intellectual world that is even more likely to be wrong.

CS Lewis framed it nicely in Mere Christianity 

“If you are a Christian you do not have to believe that all the other religions are simply wrong all through. If you are an atheist you do have to believe that the main point in all the religions of the whole word is simply one huge mistake. If you are a Christian, you are free to think that all these religions, even the queerest one, contain at least some hint of the truth ... But, of course, being a Christian does mean thinking that where Christianity differs from other religions, Christianity is right and they are wrong. As in arithmetic - there is only one right answer to a sum, and all other answers are wrong: but some of the wrong answers are much nearer being right than others.”

(One of many reasons I love Lewis so much!)

&gt;I've rejected the deity of Christ, the very idea seems alien to me now. It literally makes less sense than worshiping the Sun.

Now, I understand that point, as well as the point following, about exclusionary Christianity. What I REALLY want to know is why you linked them up so immediately. Does Jesus' divinity make no sense because you came to see how exclusionary Christianity is? If so, could you expand on that?

I am glad to meet another reasonable atheist, one who isn't simply concerned with destroying or ignoring religion. Where are you from? (I'm in Phoenix.)

Lionstrong,nyc,1389910217.0,"Will that be in a zine or online article? I would love to read that when it comes out. This is a question that I wholeheartedly would follow up with. I understand your opinion and I experience *the same exact thing* by me. Though I never referred to the ""City"" in a backhanded way, it just always seemed like a colloquialism to me. 

Maybe some of this attitude is because the average person who grew up in NYC, which I would say is 90% of native born NY'ers, were born and raised in the outer boroughs. There is a definite tone of Manhattan being the ""tourist trap"" but there is a recognition that downtown *does* have things the outer boroughs don't have. They do have a much larger preponderance of bars, and they have all the dance clubs. They have the mueseums, etc. 

But I don't think there is outright hostility for Manhattan. People in my neighborhood are *proud* to live in our area. It's unique and special. Special enough that people film multi-million dollar pictures because it's a unique feeling community. Maybe I'm lucky and live in one of the few affordable, nice neighborhoods in the outer boroughs. I assumed people in the other boroughs had their own areas they were proud to live in. 

Each borough has unique things that make it stand out *against* Manhattan. Not just to placate the bruised egos in the outer boroughs, but because (IMO) they are huge tourist destinations in their own right that no other borough has. It could be argued if it is seen as ""more of a draw"" then Manhattan landmarks or things to do, but the point is, that the outer boroughs have large ""big ticket"" destinations that *are* a draw. 

Now, if you work in the City,I could understand wanting to live close to where you work. I get that downtown has a ""flow"" that you don't always get in the outer boroughs. But that flow **is** there if you open yourself up to it and enjoy the unique flavor of them. Is the Bronx Manhattan? No. Is Brooklyn the Bronx? Hell no. Would I rather live where I am then any other borough? Yes. Mostly because I think the trade off is worth it to me.

I don't think the majority of people rag on Manhattan because they're jealous and Manhattan is some unattainable white whale to them, I think they rag on it just because they don't understand the appeal. The same as transplants to the city can't understand the appeal of the outer boroughs. "

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389910307.0,"&gt; You keep focusing on the 100% part. It would not actually double the current real prices of goods. Due to the elimination of income taxes, the pre-VAT prices would drop dramatically, especially for labour-intensive goods and services. The price of many goods and services today has hidden taxes (such as income taxes) over one third.

I'm skeptical of this.

&gt;You've got the math all mixed up. 100% VAT would result in a Basic Income in excess of $33K a year. That gives you $83K to work with. Spend $15K on necessities and that leaves you with $68K to spend on luxuries, of which half ($34K) would be taxes. This means you're paying $34K total taxes per year on an income of $83K. For most countries this would mean you'd be paying a far lower effective tax rate than people currently do (many countries have &gt;50% effective taxes for people making this amount of money).

Again, when i look at the numbers for myself, I can't believe this. 

Also, that is a very high tax rate. I'm currently arguing with a guy making $80k a year or so complaining about how a 40% flat tax would make his taxes go up so much. Even though he'd likely only pay $17k a year or something. Yeah...no offense, but your taxes are really regressive here."

T0ast1nsanity,Hawaii,1389910678.0,"West Side: Makua valley, makua cave (Kaneana), the heiau on this side, especially the ones at Pokai Bay and Makaha Valley.

 The promontory for pokai bay is the site of a heiau (Ku'ilioloa) where a Tahitian prince (Lonokaeho) landed once upon a time after previously residing in the Haleiwa area. He built the heiau as a navigational aid for practical purposes and also for Lono. He used stones he brought all the way from his home island. It is the only heiau bordered on three sides by water! The remnants of a gorgeous grove of palm trees still exists there. Waianae residents rebuilt it after the US Gov't built a bunker there...but the foundation stones always remained intact I believe.  

The area next to it, in the curve of the bay, is now owned by the Army as a recreation center that any one can visit. It is my favorite place to surf (long, lazy waves and plenty sea turtles and dolphins) but it used to be the site of a fishing village before it was razed by the US Government. 

Kane'aki is back in Makaha Valley and you can visit it along with the amazing Ka'ala farms. 

Makua Valley is one of the most beautiful sites I have ever seen. It is now owned by the US military and they used to do live fire drills and infantry lanes here. You can get a permit and hike in there like twice a month. There are heiau in there and it is interesting to note that it is believed that the Olohe people once lived there. They were believed to be a separate race from Hawaiians because they were ""red and hairless"". Also, they were really good at the ancient martial art of lua - breaking people's bones. Side note: I believe an ancient training ground for lua was on top Palehua. 

If you like hiking, I suggest taking the Kealia trail to Kuaokala trail. You can see into the valley on the backside and you can make it down to Farrington from there with some smart maneuvering. Basically you can go from Waialua to Makua similar to the way they were believed to go on the ancient trail systems that interlocked the island. 

Kaneana Cave (AKA MAkua Cave) is pretty cool as well. I have heard quite a bit about this small cave. The shark god once called this place home when the cave, which is about 150,000 years old, resided under water. But before that, the people believe that mankind was born out of this cave. A local Kumu told me that they feel this way because the ferns (which gave birth to the Kalo) are plentiful here. She also told me that the cave even looks like a woman's uterus (and you can see it when pointed out) and that it was truly the womb of the people. I believe there are many more stories and I am obviously paraphrasing, mostly due to lack of knowledge. 


Mauna Lahilahi is a very cool mountain here. It looks like an iguana from far away and sticks out onto the ocean. It was believed to be sacred to Kane and was once the site of some botanical gardens. You can go up to the top in about 15 minutes and you can find petroglyphs on the west end - mostly of people and dogs. 

Then there is  Ulehawa beach where there are still preserved ruins. This is in Nanakuli. 

And if you have time, you should try to find Aki beach. Sea turtles ALL the time, especially at sunset, but without the pesky tourists. No ancient/historical/culture significance that I know of, but one of my favorite places in the world. Tons of caves to snorkel in just be safe and watch for eel.

Anyways, this side is really cool and so many people rarely come here. Hope you have seen some of these or will check them out!"

&gt; In addition, the President’s FY 2014 Budget proposes a new $130 million initiative to address several barriers that may prevent people – especially youth and young adults – from getting help for mental health problems.  The President and the Vice President continue to call on Congress to appropriate funds for these important purposes.

Yeah, there's fucking standards in books. It effects how they're categorized by distributors, marketed by publishers, and how and where we eventually chose to put them on our shelves.

what_the_whale,MakeupAddiction,1389910916.0,"&gt;  everyone is susceptible to the subtle messages we send each other about who belongs and who doesn't.

I have a question, then (er, several): how are we to tell which is an actual subtle message about personal belonging, and which simply *seems* like a subtle message about personal belonging because that's what we expect to see? How do we control for confirmation bias here? And then, if we *can* tell apart an actual message about personal belonging, what's forcing us to internalize that message as a determinant of personal *worth*, especially if it comes from a stranger? Bascially, what's so scary and horrible about being different?

&gt; My best friend is a straight, white, American man. Not the most oppressed or emotionally delicate group in the world. 

I disagree with the placement of these traits at the top of the SJW totem pole, but continue.

&gt; and he experiences microaggressions all the time, from people continually expressing shock that he can eat with chopsticks

How is that aggression?

&gt;  to people refusing to sit next to him on the bus.

How is that aggression?

&gt; These things have a real impact on his psyche, and he is no delicate flower.

So he's different. That doesn't mean he's experienced aggression.

&gt; It's not condescending to women to claim that these kinds of messages really matter.

Yes, it is. These messages, if that's what they are (I'm skeptical) usually don't have to matter to us at all. *At all.* They're that subtle. So why let them?

When it comes to harm, let individuals speak for themselves so the few who are bothered will be heard (though not necessarily agreed with, depending on their claims), while the rest of us won't have to worry about the idiotic blanket 'preventative' rules of some feminist/SJW queen bees and white knights.

I fantasized about being able to meet them in their hotel lobby... visibly pregnant, having not said a word until then.  By the time we got to their anniversary we'd been through two failed IVFs and we'd had to cancel the trip.  When I see people's cutesy ""announcement videos"" on YouTube or ""announcement selfies"" I just can't even believe that other people really get to do that.  They get to know for months without having everyone in their lives know from the start, they get to get pregnant with just two people in the room instead of a doctor and a sonologist and an embryo specialist in the next room.  ARGH.

I still fantasize about what it will be like if I manage to get pregnant, and it drives me nuts.  This morning I was imagining snapping a cell phone pic of my positive pregnancy test and sending it to the parents and the in-laws.  And then I worry about, well, what happens if I do that and six weeks later... you know exactly what I mean /o\

bleeker_street,Advice,1389911215.0,"It's really not possible to tell if you have a sex addiction from this little information.  Generally speaking though, sex addicts tend to exhibit addict like behaviour which includes pushing others to get what they want, craving it at almost all times, accessing the object of addiction at any time, even to the point of missing work, important family functions etc., getting the object of addiction from different sources or at any cost, and generally damaging their relationships in order to get what they crave.  This doesn't sound like what's going on here. 

You seem to have a high sex drive and there's nothing wrong with that.  You also seem to have a good understanding of consent and why it's super important.  

If you're worried if this is an issue you may want to think about your previous sexual histories, how, why and if you access pornography, if you pay for sex and under what conditions.  You should be honest to yourself about the role sex plays in your relationship - is it the foundation, a bonus, an afterthought?  And you can always contact a clinical sexologist to discuss any concerns you might have. 

You sound like a guy that is kind of awesome because you are respectful of your girlfriend and you like sex a lot.  Try talking about sex with your girlfriend open and honestly and in a decidedly not sexual environment (meaning clothes are on, sex is not about to happen).  Find out what she wants, share your fantasies, and see if there is anything exploring the two of you might want to do together.

I per-ordered Absolution thinking it would be great and was left severally disappointed by the sub-par linear crap they tried to pass off as Hitman. I tried to like it, I really did. Even though I initially wanted to turn it off and never play it again after the first level, I gave it a chance to redeem itself. It never did. Each level got worse and more disappointing.

ThePinkPanther2,AskWomen,1389911337.0,"It is too heavy of a topic for me and I don't like it. I think I'm disillusioned by having or discovering a passion.  It may just be me but I feel as if there's a manic focus on passion-finding and  everyone is expected to live their passion pretty much all the time. You're expected to have a passion or else your life is devoid of something important, it lacks interesting moments, it's less special, or your hobbies aren't ""true hobbies."" 

I will avoid answering this question, probably 9/10 times it is asked, because it's created too much needless controversy in the past. People can be very stubborn over this topic and not's worth butting heads over who is ""right"" when there is no right opinion. 

I've known people who after hearing that I don't have passions but rather several interests that satisfy me, have come up and said that I will end up bored or unfulfilled in life. That's far *far* from the truth. I know that with anything (work, hobby, ect) that my sense of fulfillment would grow over time, as I become better at that them. So I never put pressure on myself to feel passionate about anything or find my passion in life. *""Passion is not something you follow. It's something that will follow you as you put in the hard work to become valuable to the world.""*-  in this I agree with Cal Newport's understanding on passion. 

Honestly, I couldn't even answer that question if someone brought it up. Because I don't necessarily feel 'passionate' while doing the things that mean the most. I mean to say that I love cooking and pottery but I become so absorbed with it. There's no discernible feelings at all while I'm doing them. Sometimes if the sauce doesn't have enough flavor and I can't get it ""right"" then I become frustrated. From someone else's perspective it would seem that cooking and crafts aren't my passions but what do they know?- it's intrinsically personal for each of us.

I'd assume the guy who brought it up would have either  clear-cut passions, believed it to be thought provoking, or has grown up being told to focus on finding his passions in life. I'm not quite sure to be honest. "

I would also like to address, your comment there, 
&gt;""If we assume God exists, and there is divine justice, our human morals don't matter""

I disagree. Now, in some respects, that's true, but I think it is much more salient to say ""If we assume God exists and there is divine justice, that is the only way our human morals could matter at all in the end.""

This goes with my point, ""If the imagery seems unjust to you, it is better to reject the imagery than to reject the idea of God's Just/Gracious stance toward us."" Your human morals are what you have. They are at once the best you have and the worst you have. My sense of justice/meaning/morality is simultaneously unfathomably full of errors and a good, indispensible part of my humanity, perhaps the *best*, most important part.

You ought to stick with your ""human morals,"" as firmly and strongly as you can, even though you know that you're probably wrong in some areas. Listen to your conscience, let others listen to theirs, and don't try to make them violate theirs. Even Paul makes this point in 1 Corinthians ""If [such] food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat again, lest I make my brother stumble.""

Meeea,Oreimo,1389911426.0,"Or, perhaps, a wild guess here, they don't have a handle of Japanese pronunciation or enunciation, and thus, use an assumed way of saying it as someone who speaks English would.

Kind of like how a lot of people seem to say ""Haganai"" as ""hah-ga-nye"", yet the ""ha"" comes from the particle は which is pronounced as a ""wa"" when used as a particle. Thus, it should be ""Waa-ga-nye"".

I'm just a huge fan of TellTale's writing and with ""The Walking Dead"" under their belt...you can pretty much expect some great things out of them.

That being said, Telltale's had some ""delays"" with some of the episodes. It sounds like they've fixed the causes of that, but a lot of people are starting to have some doubts as they've taken on a MASSIVE amount of projects: TWD: Season Two, The Wolf Among Us, a Borderlands game, and a Game of Thrones game.  It's pretty uncertain at this point as it took about 4 months for Episode 2, but The Wolf Among Us is very good and I'd recommend it to almost anyone."

GeoffreyArnold,short,1389911532.0,"You should post this in /r/tall because it would make for an interesting discussion and as a semi-tall person, you probably won't be immediately shouted down.  

However, I will say this.  I think there is a danger to attributing this type of behavior to women only.  I happen to think that these attitudes exist in our cultural zeitgeist, but men who aren't short have few opportunities to express them.  To put it another way, men also generally view short men as inferior.  However, most men have no motivation to consciously express that view because (in the straight world) short men aren't trying to associate with them in a way that would socially link them to a short man in the same way a woman is linked to a short man when they become a couple.  I don't think it has as much to do with intimacy as it does with the social shame that comes with being associated with short men.   

In other words, I don't think this is a female problem.  I think it's a broad social problem.  "

gallantfox,olympics,1389911634.0,"Jesus christ, defensive much? Looking at other responses you give here you're certainly not the most friendly.

First off, I wanna make it clear that I have no idea what a dancing bears era is or was. But I believe Dressage dates back to the 1600s, when it was used to show off what war horses were capable of doing, what commands the riders can give them without it being visible to the judges.

You too use blanket statements like ""completely 100% unnatural"" and ""never in nature"" so dont get on my ass for doing the same. But that is incorrect and you show a lack of basic equine knowledge. Yes, obviously some movements are trained but... who cares? It is not like it hurts the animal or harms them whatsoever. But many many of the movements are natural. There are 4 basic gaits: walk, trot, canter, gallop. Gallop is not used in dressage for there is not enough room. Walk, trot, canter is used in dressage and is completely natural to the horse. 

There are movements called ""**Piaffe**,"" which is a trot in place. Yes, very unlikely to see in the wild but not entirely unnatural.

Another movement is a ""**Passage**,"" which is trotting but with smaller strides, or a ""**collected**"" stride. There are also extended gates for walk, trot and canter. These are also very common in the wild, in no way unnatural.

A ""**Pirouette**"" is a.... Pirouette. Just spinning in a circle with the tail as the axis point. This does happen in the wild, but as before is unlikely to be a common behavior.

A ""**flying change**"" is when the horses change leads with every stride. This is probably the most unnatural gate you will see in dressage.


There are more, but I'll spare you for now. The only real unnatural thing about dressage is putting it all together in controlled concise movements. 

If you have any more questions about it let me know! My expertise is in horse racing though, not dressage but I am familiar with it!"

As far as buying auction wrecks: I have purchased several totalled cars from Auction. Generally, you want to find a donor (wrecked) car with every available option, and a good motor and tranny. Side impact is the best for this; you usually don't need to replace anything other than door cards, and seat rails. Then, get a base model that has a bad motor, tranny, or something that greatly reduces its value. Put all the high end parts into the base model, and swap motor or tranny if they weren't damaged. The problem you can run into is having lots of extra parts lying around, but usually you can part out the remaining stuff on enthusiasts' websites. Every now and then you get a car that was more damaged than was reported, and you're just SOL. Unless you were doing maybe 3 or 4 of these a week: It's not profitable. That is why they're totaled in the first place; it's not worth the time and money. "

3. The quality of apps is better on the app store. 

4. iMessage, FaceTime, and FaceTime audio are seamlessly built into the phone. 

5. You can use your existing google calendar with it, or switch over to iCloud. Same goes for your email accounts, etc etc. 

6. Touch ID is a really nice and secure feature

7. The phone is fast, and works well. It doesn't require much tweaking... however, if you like tweaking... there's jailbreaking. 

8. Jailbreaking allows you to tweak things like the theme, UI, etc of your iOS. It's analogous to rooting. 

9. Good battery life. So long as you're in an area where the cell signal is strong, and your phone doesn't have to boost power to the antenna, you'll easily get a day's charge out of it.

Show **clearly** (I can't stress this enough) that you are interested and give him some time to adjust and I think things should be fine. If you are okay with it make the first move (however far along you are) or make it clear that he's free (and encouraged) to do so.

In my case being shy is mostly an insecurity in my ability to read signals. I don't know if a girl is attracted or not or what I'm supposed to do. I have missed many a chance throughout my life because of this.

Interesting side note.  Johnny Cash , Alice Cooper,Blondie, and Pet shop Boys were hired to Perform songs for the movies but none of their songs were chosen. The songs they did write however, were successful on their own albums.

roketgirl,legaladvice,1389912159.0,"IANAL, but I did do some research on this because I'm a handy gardener and did some serious thinking about pulling up stakes on my career and managing a greenhouse.  I didn't go forward with those plans because of a combination of obnoxious record keeping requirements, fear of being targeted for robbery, and whatever next federal administration comes in could wipe out my investment and use all my state-required records to stick my ass in jail.   Lastly, we don't know the penalties are if anything goes wrong.  What happens if a couple of pounds go missing due to shrinkage?  Do they pull your license on the spot and now you are sitting on enough inventory for a felony?  I don't want to be the gal who finds out. 

One caveat - all my information is based on non-medical marijuana.  The Liquor Board only sets rules for recreational MJ, and medical MJ is a different set of laws that I haven't looked at. 

Anyway, to your questions, as far as I know from reading the information at the Liquor Control Board...

&gt;I doubt it would be possible to resell medicinal marijuana, but upon my 21st birthday, and the ability to purchase marijuana legally, would it then be legal to sell it within baked goods? 

Everyone in an operation growing/processing/retailing must be 21.  

If you are looking to bake, you would need a Processors license ($250 application fee, $1000 renewal annually).  The state is keeping processors/growers, and retailers separate - ie, they won't issue you both a processor and a retailer license.   You can be both a processor and grower at the same time, but will need two licenses.  You would need to find someone with a retailer's license and sell to them, collect your 25% excise tax and pay that to the liquor board.   

At each stage of growing, processing, and retailing, there is a 25% excise tax, so while I don't know if it's legal to buy from a retailer and then process and sell back to a retailer, it certainly doesn't make good business sense since your product would be 25% more expensive than if you went directly to the grower.  


&gt;would people I'm baking with need to be over 21? 

Yes.  Also, they will need to have clean records.  You will also need facilities (ie, not your home) because the rules allow the state to inspect your premises and books at any time.  Your facilities can't be within 1000 feet of schools, parks, etc. etc. 

&gt;If it all was legal, would it be possible to sell those to a bakery/co-op/farmer's market? 

If they had a retail license, and you have a processors license and collect the excise tax, yes.

Oh yes.  You'll need a business license AND the processing license. Again, you can't be a processor and a retailer at the same time, so a bakery where you are processing and retailing at the same time is a no.

Kazan remained controversial in some circles until his death for testimony he gave before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) in 1952, a period that many, such as journalist Michael Mills, feel was ""the most controversial period in Hollywood history.""[47] When he was in his mid 20s, during the Depression years 1934 to 1936, he had been a member of the American Communist Party in New York, for a year and a half.



In April 1952, the Committee called on Kazan, under oath, to identify Communists from that period 16 years earlier. Kazan initially refused to provide names, but eventually named eight former Group Theater members who he said had been Communists: Clifford Odets, J. Edward Bromberg, Lewis Leverett, Morris Carnovsky, Phoebe Brand, Tony Kraber, Ted Wellman, and Paula Miller, who later married Lee Strasberg. He testified that Odets quit the party at the same time that he did.[48] All the persons named were already known to HUAC, however.[3][49] The move cost Kazan many friends within the film industry, including playwright Arthur Miller."

So the only reason someone who has better perspective than you, ie; someone who's actually been circumcised, would disagree with you on circumcision being this horrible, horrible thing would be because they're denying it in order to ""not think of themselves as mutilated""?

**Fiction**

* Currently reading the [A Song of Ice and Fire Series](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/822993.A_Game_of_Thrones), which is thought-provoking in that George R.R. Martin breaks some of the ""rules"" of writing fantasy/fiction. Ex: everyone's a grey character, early death is inevitable, unlikeable people get face time too. 

* The [Sea of Trolls series](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100476.The_Sea_of_Trolls) is an easy read, being children's literature. It was my favorite as a pre-teen. Based on Norse mythology, set in 793 AD. Has a riveting plot. Worth reading even as an adult.

* [The Phantom Tollbooth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/378.The_Phantom_Tollbooth?ac=1) - another children's book. The wordplay/imagination/focus on learning make it unforgettable.

* [A Wrinkle in Time series](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117980.A_Wrinkle_in_Time) - if you can get past some of the Christian analogies, it's a good series. My favorite is [A Swiftly Tilting Planet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77276.A_Swiftly_Tilting_Planet?ac=1) (read it! it's good by itself but better with the background from the other books in the series)

**Nonfiction**

* Anything by Feynman, starting with [this](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5544.Surely_You_re_Joking_Mr_Feynman_). Funny and informative.

* Anything by Bill Bryson, starting with [A Walk in the Woods](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9791.A_Walk_in_the_Woods?ac=1). Bryson writes fresh, humorous, informative tales. He does travel writing and various non-fiction.

* [On Writing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10569.On_Writing?ac=1) by Stephen King. The first half of this book is an autobiography, the second half is solid advice for writing and for life.

* [Early Retirement Extreme](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9519944-early-retirement-extreme) may be hit or miss depending on your goals in life. If you haven't much considered frugality, early retirement, or the value of your time and youth, consider reading it. Beware that it's written a little bit like a math textbook. Lund actually uses LaTex to format it iirc.

a few thinks to keep in mind is the schedule of installation would it be easier for installation/protection purposes if you had them each monitored for a short while (this would depend on how they are bing monitored and if the AHJ will accept that)

i know one of the code issues you will incounter is have a main fire alarm panel but if this is a short period of transition you could make the case to the AHJ

You are mistaken I'm afraid. The reason track aero helmets are typically tailless is because in most track events there is a lot of looking around, and if the tail is at right angles to the air flow, it would actually be slowing you down.

I think this falls too close to being a judgment call for MLB to allow it to be reviewed and would set precedent for balls/strikes to be reviewed.

I think we made out pretty good on this one.  Steals can be reviewed, so no more ""the ball beat him, so he's out.""  Safe/out at first can now be reviewed, so no more ""bang-bang"" plays.  HBP is another big one, especially when trying to determine whether it hit the bat or the player.

And saying that because some rebounds are uncontested/easy to get devalues the stat is like saying that points scored or FG% have less value because sometimes guys get layups or uncontested dunks.

Also, I never said you couldn't (tho the law does) I said that you were an asshole, there's a difference.

You'd lay out the CDs and records with songs you were thinking about putting on, and there might be one that was a favourite of yours at the time, but hearing the ends of the other songs as you recorded them, none of them seemed to suggest an opening for it, so you'd just have to let it drop.

I was talking about this with a beautiful French girl, nearly a year back now, and she asked me to make her a tape. I made a full-colour liner with a montage of all the artists. She got back with her ex in between me making it and giving it to her. I had no regrets; I'd recently stayed round hers (and shared her bed with her), and we listened to 'Let's Get It On' by Marvin Gaye and TALKED ABOUT THE DRUMMING.

Good god...

But this is the life I have chosen. This New Year a teenager kissed me after we'd started talking about Marvin Gaye, and all I was thinking about was how much I REALLY wanted to talk some more about Marvin Gaye.

I know that goal under review is legit 2 minutes before the crowd does, because a local journalist is watching a replay that we don't get to see at the game.  That's kind of neat.

There were also multiple late-night get-togethers (also including dancing) and the more brazen of my neighbors called the cops on her at least three times.

bobbyg27,promos,1389913082.0,"No you are wrong, by definition. ""Gold"" is the term given to the version of the game that then can be used for ""actual in-game video/screenshots!"" marketing purposes, is the version of the game that gets sent to rating agencies and reviewers, and is most often the code that gets printed on discs to be sold as physical retail. 

Physical boxes almost always have ESRB or PEGI ratings on the box themselves, which means before any box can be printed, a ""final"" version of the game must be sent to each agency, the agency must go through the entire game and let the game know what the rating will be. Sometimes ratings can be more strict than anticipated, and developers must make small tweaks (cut out a scene, change a texture, change some dialogue, etc) to get the rating they were hoping for. This is a process that can take a while; do you think developers just sit around twiddling their thumbs during this process?

Most games have physical copies that are sold at retailers, and not just Steam/Origin keys, it takes more than one day to get all those copies printed and distributed nationwide or even internationally and in stores with the correct box before release day.  Reviewers will have needed time to review it, and so on.

There is a lot of time between when a game is finished and when it is available for purchase. As I mentioned before, DLC is not subject to the same restrictions because DLC ""by definition"" is downloadable content, hence no physical copy required, and is often immune from ratings requirements because it is an optional add-on.  During the timing gap above, after completing a game and before it releases, developers can continue to work on additional content to be used as DLC either to sell or to use as incentive for preorders, or to give away for free to everyone if they want."

redwhiskeredbubul,PurplePillDebate,1389913128.0,"I think the important thing to keep in mind here is that human understanding of biological sex is filtered through our cultural understanding of gender, arguably more so than our ideas of gender are shaped off of biology. 

Now, by this I don't mean that biological sex doesn't exist. Human beings have sexual dimorphism in a way that is specific to humans, and that sexual dimorphism in peoples' bodies are shaped by their chromosomes in ways we can understand. But chromosomes can never explain everything. Take, as a complementary example, people with Turner's Syndrome or Kleinfelter's Syndrome. Why do we view these as medical issues in the first place, and not as third or fourth biological sexes? Because of gender. By and large people with these conditions identify themselves as women, and so does society at large. We don't have third and fourth genders available for them. Indeed, medically we see them as women with chromosome disorders. Intersex people are in something of the same boat, though I think it's even more striking with the above examples available.  

If it's not chromosomes, then, what or whom actually determines a person's gender?  I think trans people are basically people for whom this question is immediately pressing and shit hitting the fan. As somebody who identifies as bi, I get the plasticity of sexual orientation somewhat intuitively: it's not that you wake up one morning and discover you have become a bisexual (it's a label, not a personal destiny) but more that you wake up one morning and the assumed stability of heterosexual orientation isn't there anymore--you realize it wasn't supported by anything but itself. I don't see why gender should be any different. 

That's why a belief that one's gender is wrong can't be 'delusional'--it belongs to the class of facts which are in fact true by virtue of the fact that one believes in them. If it's anything like sexual orientation, though, I do think that the rightness or wrongness of one's gender is a product of how one transitions, though--the 'fixedness'  of it is something constructed ex post facto.

&gt; Yes it is.

No, it's not. You think it is, but it's not. That's the whole point of this thread of comments, that since institutions such as modern, first-world hospitals, the CDC, governments, the very definition of the word itself do not define male circumcision as ""genital mutilation"".

People who insist that it is are arguing against all this evidence to the contrary. It's like you're telling me gravity no reals, man. :(

Like, I understand why opposition to circumcision exists. But claiming that it's ""genital mutilation"" is disingenuous. Argue the points that you have ground to stand on, like how it's performing a potentially life-altering procedure on an infant who's unable to consent."

I never said it's negligible, as if insecure men are an anomaly. I just stated insecurities with men are less than with women. How much less I don't know and can't comment on. I actually only know 1 insecure guy in real life that actually has a real problem with it, and that's my brother, but that goes a lot further than just his body. Most of my friends and my peer group are pretty stable people, so my anecdotal evidence is completely off and not representative for the general population, which I know.

However, I wouldn't use studies that say teenage males are insecure to prove men are also prone to insecurities, because if there is one thing we shouldn't be using to generalize anything anywhere, it's the way teenagers look at the world.

I know some men are insecure, the point I was making is that -in general- it's less than women."

I've never had an addictive personality, but I was really starting to scare myself that I was going to become an alcoholic. I never tried to quit while we were together, but I was afraid if I did, that I was going to realize how addicted I was. 

Well we got divorced, and not too long after that, my daughter got hurt in an accident and had to be hospitalized (this had nothing to do with my drinking or her dad's drug use) for 10 days. She's 100% recovered now, but I spent the entire ten days by her bedside and didn't even think about alcohol. Like, I wasn't even thinking about how long it had been since I had a drink or anything. I was totally consumed with her welfare. 

Anyway, that was well over 2 years ago and I drink very rarely now, and usually stop after 2-3 drinks at most when I do drink. I've had the same bottle of rum in my house for over 6 months. I'm really proud of that. I don't really even give alcohol a second thought or worry now. "

Instead, it usually degrades my sympathy for the protesters and their cause.

Case in point: I was pretty sympathetic to the Occupy movement when it started.  I happen to think that the cozyness between big government and big business is a problem, and I was glad that people were saying something about it and garnering some press.  Then the Occupados started blocking bus traffic through central Seattle, blocking bridges, and so forth.  From that point on, my attitude was 'fuck 'em.'  While I still dislike the cozyness between government and business, I find that I have nothing nice to say to anyone who identifies as an Occupado, and don't really care about their priorities approaches.

lumpking69,sips,1389913430.0,"Well, I'll be honest and say that I'm really going to miss Skyrim. I never played the game very much beyond the first 15 minutes, it just didn't work for me.

Having it vanish and not getting a finalized/completed story kinda blows. So I will be spending an inordinate amount of time hoping the series returns and will always check my inbox for it! lol In short, I'm going to miss the growth and development that comes with the series based shows ala Skyrim, Simcity and to a lesser extent, Minecraft.

Colres,gifs,1389913460.0,"Good question. Your logic served you well, except you didn't have all the information- as you said, the next step in the process whatever that may be.

This type of transportation has many benefits. One of the first things you think when planning a business is, what are the challenges we face? In the case of logging, the practical challenges are several. Trees don't just spring up overnight, so the more you take down, the farther you'll have to go. Or maybe you have building permission to build your lumber mill in one spot, but can only cut trees somewhere far away. Another challenge is fire. Having flammable logs heaped up around your expensive machinery in your mill isn't good if you're planning on leaving cigarette butts around.

So how do we solve those problems? The first one we can solve by building along a river, so a barge with some tugs can quickly take the logs back and forth. The second problem can be solved by keeping the logs wet, which will also keep the wood in good condition for being processed.

There's another bonus too! Since everything is about efficiency, having the barge stop and lift the logs over with the crane is going to slow things down a lot. Your barge is caught up in a slow process of unloading when it could be headed back for another load. Since this type of operation is most often built on a river, we can just dump the logs and they'll float right along nature's conveyer belt into the mill."

JarlesV3,dogeservice,1389913588.0,"Alright, I have a little bit of time today, and took a quick refresher on Sn1 and Sn2 reactions.

The biggest difference is the number of steps in the mechanism. If you can remember the steps, you can see the difference between the two reactions.

Lets start with Sn1: Sn1 is a 2 step reaction. The first step involves that leaving group leaving, creating a carbo-cation (our carbon cation that we talked about last time). The leaving group is normally a Halide (Bromine or Chlorine being fairly common).  And the Sn1 reaction is favored in for molecules that have steric hindrance. These are molecules that have more stuff on it that gets in the way. And as we talked about with carbocation stabilization last time, the more bonds to the carbon with the positive charge, the better. We normally rate this as 3º &gt; 2º &gt; 1º, meaning carbons bonded to 3 other carbons are most favorable (tertiary), then carbons bonded to 2 other carbons next (secondary), and finally carbons at the end of a chain of carbons (bound to one other carbon, or primary). Our carbocation is stabilized by a polar solvent (like water H2O) and less so in non-polar solvents. After the leaving group leaves, the Nucleophile (often with a negative charge) comes in and binds to the carbocation.

Because it is a two step mechanism, we will have a racemic mixture as the nucleophile attaches from either direction on the plane, making two different enantiomers. Or if we have some resonance, the location of the + charge can change, changing the location of the nucleophilic addition. And it's possible to have other side reactions as well, such as an elimination reaction.

Sn2 is a one step reaction, and the addition of the nucleophile and the leaving of the leaving group happen at the same time. The Nucleophile will come in from the opposite side of the molecule as the leaving group, and as it kicks off the leaving group, the steriochemical configuration (that's the Chirality, or how the 4 bonds are arranged) flips, or inverts. This gives us only 1 enantiomer, or 1 product.

Gotta run again, but I hope this starts to help for Sn1 and Sn2 reactions. I'll try to come back for E1 and E2."

Czar-Salesman,SubredditDrama,1389913769.0,"&gt;&gt; We don't remove our appendix because we might get appendicitis.

&gt;Except we do.
After a bout of appendicitis (which, if caught early on, can almost always be cured by IV antibiotic therapy) it is standard medical practice to remove the appendix in order to prevent future occurrences.

You completely misunderstood what I said. What you mentioned is after you get appendicitis never before. We don't go around removing appendixes as baseline preventative because not everyone will get appendicitis.

&gt;The smallpox vaccine procedure (when it was used way back when) inevitably left a round scar on one's arm almost 1 cm in diameter.  Back when I was a kid everyone had one.  But that wasn't ""arm mutilation"" either.

The worst false equivalent you could possibly choose.

&gt;&gt;Why remover the foreskin for no other reason than religious and cultural norms?

&gt;Your question indicates an alarming lack of awareness.  Both CDC and UN health agencies note a significantly decreased rate of infection and transmission for a large number of STDs (including AIDS) in the circumcised populace.

This is the one and only semi valid argument that is brought up, except for the fact we have these things called condoms and that all STIs(even HIV) are manageable and as we progress will continue to diminish in severity of effect they have on people's lifves. Its basically a moot point.

&gt;&gt;Unnecessary and in my opinion an infringement on the child's human rights.

&gt;We give numerous vaccines to children which make them cry (because they hurt!) and occasionally , rarely, lead to a child's death or disability.  No serious person believes this is an infringement on a child's human rights due both to the benefits received and the universal understanding that babies do not have the capacity to make such decisions for themselves and so the parents are a perfectly acceptable  proxy.


False equivalent. Comparing a shot to removing part of the penis is ridiculous. Vaccines are scientifically proven to be beneficial, they are without a doubt preventative against disease and good for your child as well as the rest of society. It does not harm or alter the child physically in any way. The issue of consent here is also a false equivalent, a flue shot is a medical decision made in order to protect the child from disease they may contract other wise, circumcision is not in and of itself beneficial to someone who does not need it.

Mutilation is an act of physical injury that degrades the appearance or function of any living body.

Circumcision is text book genital mutilation. "

I know people like to say that, and I think it's a great mindset to have, but this statement only appears true through the lens of coincidence. I mean, do people actually believe that? Is this some metaphorical way of disguising luck in a nice package? If you are looking for a used car, and your feeling healthy and optimistic, do you sit around waiting for the perfect vehicle to fall into your lap? Of course you don't. What you do instead is get up and put effort into your search. Find out what interests you and pursue it.

You can have perfect mental health and ooze confidence, and that does not mean romantic interests will start falling into your lap when you aren't looking. OP will still have to put monumental heaps of effort towards meeting women, especially in person. If you're no longer in school or other such social structure, you better have friends with single female friends and clubs to join, and events and other social gatherings to participate in or you will continue to be single. It takes effort and aptitude and extraordinary luck unless you won the genetic lottery which most of us have not.

goodguy101,learnpython,1389913940.0,"I am getting data from an ethernet connection in packets of custom data ""words."" These words are a header + 32 bits of data. The data is then parsed for sub-word fields. So data1 = [31:20], data2 = [19:15], data3 = ... etc.

I have a dictionary for the data coming in that is indexed by chunk number and length: dict[0], dict[500], dict[1000], etc.

From this raw data dictionary I parse it and create another dictionary that is addressed by the actual data values: dict[data1] = [list of values], dict[data2] = [list of values], etc.

I then create reports and plots and other stuff from the lists within the dictionary. The data is not always broken down to the same sub-word bit fields. It depends on what the header is.

My reason is that I could physically get data a lot faster from the DUT, yet I am limited by the intensive data parsing and dictionary accessing. What can I do to optimize performance?"

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389913954.0,"&gt; wealth and income a different though. the two entities should not be treated the same.

Rich still get most of the income.

&gt;the only problem that comes with giving the far majority a net sum of money is ... where the fuck is it coming from?????? you can't even tax the rich enough to provide that kind of money. it's just absolutely ridiculous that you think it will even work.

Yes we can. And I already provided the numbers. Effective tax rates are often in the 30-50% range for many other countries.

&gt;that video is pretty much garbage. it doesn't show any true numbers. not once in that video do they track an individual over time. someone might be in the bottom 20% one year, and in the top 20% 5 years later. but that idea isn't even touched upon in that video because it only panders to a certain crowd.

I watched the ""learn liberty"" rebuttal, which is where Im guessing you're pulling this from. It's a load of bull. Anyway, I took a class on social stratification in college before and this issue was addressed. Idk where to find this online exactly, but most people stay around the income bracket they were raised in. Rags to riches is the exception to the rule, not the rule.

Even if social mobility was a big deal...why the **** should the poor be so bad off that they barely register at all to begin with!?

Also, just clicked your first link, AHAHAHA. Yep, same video I thought you were pulling this bull from. You realize ""learn liberty"" is a blatantly libertarian perspective I don't buy into? Literally everything they post is so full of crap I don't even know how to begin. They sidestep the issue entirely.

As I said, listen, dude, I studied this in college. I spent a whole semester studying this stuff. Posting a couple ideologically biased vids from some lolbertarian youtube channels won't get very far from me."

So you could stall that one out using all his stat-boosting squire moves and go into the velius fight with a super ramza. However it was still pretty dicey because you were stuck in a small room 1v1ing one of FFT's super OP holy knight type characters while you tried to do it.

edit: oh and don't forget the bullshit fight shortly after Velius where you're on the roof and Rafa has been ambushed by 2 assassins. You need to save her life but she's AI controlled. 9 times out of 10 she would bumrush those assassin girls and use her shitty staff attack on them, and they'd use their motherfucking one hit kill on her.

Why the fuck would anyone engage in bone surgery for 20% of the costs that they charge in the United States?  These fools were saying ""it's cheaper in India because of the cost of living"".  NOPE.  It's cheaper because it's more dangerous, the surgeon is less experienced, the tools are not as good, and there is a weak regiment of legal consequences available to patients who are left crippled because of the operations.  THAT IS WHY IT'S SO CHEAP!

riseandrise,AskWomen,1389914250.0,"One issue I haven't seen mentioned yet is people marrying partners with drastically different libidos than their own. I know at least three couples who have married in the last few years where at least one partner was already dissatisfied before the wedding with the amount of sex they were having. If you want sex three times a week, and your partner wants sex three times a month, and that's BEFORE any of the stresses that come with marriage... You're gonna have a bad time. 

I think a lot of people have this idea that it's shallow to break up with someone just because you're unsatisfied with the frequency of sex. This means a lot of people end up married to people they love but are actually sexually incompatible with. I see it all the time on /r/sex, /r/relationships and even /r/AskMen (though I can't recall seeing it on *this* sub I'm sure it's been posted here too).

I think in the end it doesn't matter how much you love someone... Incompatible sex drives will slowly eat away your relationship from the inside out. The one who wants sex more often will feel angry and rejected, and the one wants sex less often will feel used and harassed, and all of this can ruin even the best of relationships.

That doesn't mean that some level of disparity isn't natural. And of course you have to assume that during certain times sex will decline. But overall your best shot for being happy with the frequency of your sex life is to marry someone with a similar drive to yours."

The way to actually intuitively eat is to start eating proper portions and nutritious things, and then becoming accustomed to the way it makes your body react. Then, you look for those signals to decide whether you are actually hungry for something.

Triplanetary,plotholes,1389914392.0,"Yeah, what kills the whole idea is the really stupid notion that the police actually arrest and imprison the perpetrator of the future crime. That makes no sense at all.

Now, if we suddenly had the means to see future crimes, and the police made it part of its mandate to use that information to prevent those crimes, that'd be awesome. They just show up at the house, ""Hey, don't murder that lady, thanks,"" and yay, the lady remains unmurdered. Obviously their job can't end there - if the would-be murder was the culmination of a cycle of domestic abuse, for example, they should take the victim under their protection and possibly investigate any *past* instances of assault in that situation. If it was going to be a heat-of-the-moment crime of passion, then perhaps they could mandate anger management classes or something, but for the most part the crime's pretty much prevented once the heated moment is dispersed.

There's plenty the police could do with that kind of information without actually arresting people who haven't committed any crime. What makes it all even more repugnant, especially in the original Dick story, is that Anderton only cares to the extent that suddenly he's on the other side of this system.

But the Dick story isn't intended to be a moralistic parable or anything. Its dystopia is a background setting, not a warning. It pretty much just examines the question of what happens when the would-be murderer is the person who has access to these precognitions in the first place, which is to say that it fucks up the whole concept of precognition."

This is my favourite piece of advice in this thread. As a child, I used to emulate my parents' excitability with no thought given to what I might want as an outcome or what effect it might have on other people. I was quite oblivious to social cues and I could have used some prompting to pay attention to people's emotions. 

It may be that the daughter in question hasn't yet seen a reason to care what others think and feel and discussion of social interaction may get some gears turning. It's also an activity that doesn't require the kind of extroverted behaviour that an introverted parent would struggle with. 

(As a sidenote, while questions are great, leading questions are not. They're confusing and frustrating for a child. ""You made that girl upset, didn't you?"" would be a lousy question. Better questions might be: ""What did she want to do? How did she feel when you held on to her arms?"")"

dict[0] = [all raw data of 500 words], dict[500] = [next block of raw data], etc.

I then parse it (sort through packets) and put it into another dictionary addressed by data value:

dakru,AskMen,1389914536.0,"Try to think of it from a guy's perspective. What we've seen and experienced in our lives is generally that kindness is not the primary factor in a man's desirability as a partner. This is evident in the fact that there are plenty of men who are very kind and sweet but who are unable to attract women. Clearly there are other more important factors in their lack of success with women (primarily lack of charisma and ability to stand up for themselves, in my opinion).

And then you come and say that it is the primary factor in your desire for your boyfriend. Maybe it's true in your case. It's certainly possible. But according to what we see and what we experience personally, it's not true for women in general. For women in general, kindness can be good but it's not the primary thing that will make them want you as a partner. And guys can't exactly base their approach to attracting women on what one woman says she finds attractive.

&gt; I could say, he's tall and handsome, but that's superficial and subjective. 

This is odd. You seem to be saying that him being tall and handsome was one of the primary factors in his desirability to you, but that can't be the case because it's ""superficial"". I don't understand. Either his looks were one of the primary factors or they weren't. Mentioning ""superficial"" here suggests downplaying the importance of looks because you don't want to be seen as superficial.

&gt; So if you asked me, why do I love him, ""Oh he's the kindest and most compassionate person I know,"" which, according to you, isn't very useful.

I'm not saying that on woman saying this is useless. I'm saying that hearing it so often from women in general is useless."

It's him adding to the already heavy and very prevalent sexualisation of women in this genre, where woman are used as wish fulfilment and are, in this case, even sexual objects if they are intelligent. None of them are ugly or fat-chested or...look, this doesn't matter. This is the context, and you seem to be not concentrating on the history of sexism within this genre. This sort of comment *doesn't help*.

It isn't the worst thing anyone's done, it's not even something I'm particularly bothered by, but I can totally see why people are - because it was not the right thing to do. My point, also, wasn't that Pat needs to go on about sexy men, but that *very few* go on about teenage men except for YA girl wank and fanfiction, which isn't strictly genre. I mean, the Bechdel test seems to be failing for guys if you can't handle one AMA without talking about boobs, isn't it?

There is a problem with sexualising women. I don't know if you're male or female, and I'm not going to assume (since I know plenty of women with your views on this matter), but I'm not comfortable being sexualised. It's uncomfortable to be viewed that way. You might think this is one comment, but it runs so much deeper that allowing that kind of comment to pass is, on some standards, not okay because it just doesn't help a troublesome and deeply-rooted-within-fantasy matter.

(On another note, do you think Anne Rice oversexualises her male characters that much? I thought she sexualised *all* her characters, really - especially Lestat's mother - fuck, what's her name? Gabrielle, says google - in the second book, jesus. But it's hard to tell because vampires don't really care about sexual organs, it's all sexy on other levels, ha.)

grim_wizard,changemyview,1389914719.0,"Actually I advocate a limited freedom environment, because it makes the people stronger and because I believe too much freedom is toxic. My father was a general, and I grew up following strict guidelines and how he told me to grow up. And I did well, though in my mid teens he said, ""Son, everyone has the desire to be free, and as you were growing up you didn't have the freedoms that other kids did, however you can now choose to do what you want or you can continue to live like you have."" 

Honestly it was culture shock and I met a lot of closed minded individuals, and it changed me, and in that I feel that too much freedom is like too much candy, good in moderation, but too much makes you sick, and sadly that's not a view that will ever change for me, but I don't think many people will judge me hard here so this is why I say it.

LondonZombie,Planetside,1389914748.0,"&gt; Most of the VS reload animations are ""Spin out the battery, throw it away, fiddle off screen, throw the battery in, spin in battery"".

VS weapons - LMGs in particular, would benefit from some [alternate weapon designs](http://www.planetside-universe.com/media/album/q4q5tnh4w8/20130711_51df43bda9fa3.jpg) and [reload animations.](http://i.imgur.com/JtlJdSB.jpg)

&gt; ...the foregrip on every long LMG and AR is in the wrong location!

Thinking critically about the weapon designs in this game will often lead to such stark, slightly grating realizations, unfortunately.  I suspect, at least with the LMGs and other long-barreled guns, that this may be more or less to do with first-person camera perspective.  

Existing focal length and/or camera position may not work particularly well with a properly mounted foregrip, as the player's forearm would likely obscure the gun's silhouette, not to mention a fair amount of the screen itself - a massive, solid triangle of player geometry blocking the lower third of the screen."

Buscat,AskReddit,1389914849.0,"The Mercedes Nurburgring challenge in Gran Turismo 4. I consider myself pretty decent at driving the 'ring in games but I could never beat it.

Basically you're in a super fast modern Mercedes Supercar, and a series of slower older mercedes take off before you on the nurburgring. I forget the head start they get but it's multiple minutes. You need to pass them all before one lap is complete (the nurburgring takes like 8 minutes to complete a lap of). You actually have to sit and wait for all the cars to take off though, you can't just skip to the part where YOU start driving. And as you catch up with them, you'll be travelling so much faster than they are that it's quite easy to cause an accident.

Also, the specific car you're using in the challenge handles slightly differently from the normal version of that car you can unlock, so you can't just do a bunch of practice laps outside the challenge if you want that perfect lap. You need to sit there for like 3 minutes EVERY TIME YOU TRY.

First of all digitizing film is a pretty complex process (if you're doing it right) and was used by the film industry for a long time. Assuming they're in color there's a specific scanner for this type of thing that needs proper calibration and this is probably where your high costs are coming from. I'm actually really impressed that Costco does it and if I had to guess I'd say they're your best bet for getting acceptable quality and for a low price. You should be able to get the ""raw"" files from the DVD I would think.

As for point 1. Yes it's do-able but oh my god that would be labor intensive and the quality would be all over the place depending on your set-up. You'd also probably need to process every photo individually if you didn't know how to set up the camera correctly. ugh I would really not recommend this approach.

&gt;Oh, and of course, the Constitutional requirement for presidency was not the subject of that case, and the Supreme Court has never addressed the presidential requirement clause. You can speculate about how they might answer, as can anyone else. But you can not claim to know.

I always enjoy boobies, but that lopsided dynamic does sometimes make it seem like lazy titillation instead of a storytelling element. Men get naked during sex too. "
ohgeronimo,Buddhism,1389915005.0,"Mutual gains in this case means neither you nor they will, in theory, be worse off for the effort. Now, I don't know about others, but I really have no interest in gaining anything if it means someone else will be losing in the process. I'd much rather take what is willingly given, than take what will cause distress to others. So by saying it's capable of leading to mutual gains I mean it's like saying I get to put my choice of topping on my pizza. I will eat pizza most likely even if it's not my choice of topping, but when given the choice I'll probably choose the toppings I feel like choosing. If I can act in such a way that doesn't cause harm to others, then I get to put my toppings on and eat my pizza too. So doing so is a smart way to get what I'd like. Acting in a way that would cause harm however, not only do I feel like I'm doing something I'd really rather not, but I might also come to find someone now holds a grudge and wants to throw my pizza on the floor. So, if I don't want that to happen, it's smart to act in such a way that they won't have anything to hold a grudge about. I get out of my way by seeing what obstacles I might be creating.

As to being happy.. Yeah, you're right, on all of that. But just you watch how many people don't actually reflect on that. They get really upset, when all they need to do is accept it and change what they can or move on. It's because they say, ""I'm unhappy, and I don't want to be."" that one feels motivated to help them be happy. Generally, I like people. They're neat. So when one of them says they have an issue, I enjoy trying to help. I can't end unhappiness for everyone, I can't even end it for one person other than myself. But if they ask how I find my happiness during troubling times, I can certainly tell them and help them understand perhaps why they're unhappy. Maybe I can ask questions, or maybe I can point out things they're not really paying attention to. They still need to do ""things"" on their end, but it's really easier to see obstacles when someone helps you realize they're obstacles.

I like helping others, I like seeing them smile, and I like the idea that those times when I was sad and miserable and cursing the world that no one wanted to help me I'm in theory making less likely to occur for someone else. I once got terribly upset at the idea that I was miserable and no one wanted to help. By offering to help, I'm doing exactly what I wanted someone to do. But they need to ask, in some way. Otherwise I'll assume they know what they're doing and let them get to it.

Alan Watts once made a point of saying he wasn't a guru or teacher, but a sort of philosophical entertainer. He wasn't trying to teach happiness, just sharing his ideas about the matter to those that came to him asking for it. He did his talks because he wanted to (and mentioned he didn't prepare in advance but rather spoke from the then and now) and because people came to listen.

You ask a question, I think I might be able to help you answer it, I think it might be fun to do so, so I talk to you. Or maybe I don't think it'll be fun, but you're still asking. Maybe I don't even try to help you answer your question, because I'm just speaking about the subject because I feel like speaking about it after you asked. And then when I'm done, I go on to whatever else. Sometimes we just enjoy speaking about something when prompted. Sure, plenty of reasons to do so, but like you say it's really just about choosing to do it. The results don't really matter, as you've more or less said. There's nothing wrong with being sad, unless you decide you don't want to be. So you ask someone how to not be sad, and they answer don't be sad. Maybe they answer in a weird way, but it's up to you to discern whatever meaning you want from what they've said.

So personally, I don't think Alan Watts was deeply unhappy. I think he just talked about how to be happy because he wanted to talk about how to be happy and because there were people there wanting to hear it. Otherwise he'd probably just think it, if he was in the mood."

We've got this one crazy lady living in a 1 room apartment. She used to have four or five cats, but she tripped on one and broke her arm. She kicked most of the cats outside (kept one, her favorite) so now they live all around the apartment block. She still feeds them every day. 

The cats piss in the staircases of the building as well as the basement, they leave scratch marks on cars and they poop in the sandbox where kids play. Well, used to play, since now it's a cat toilet. One neighbour's kid told the lady that he will call animal control, to catch those cats since they cause damage, she started screaming and threatening police, since those cats are her property and all that.

I'll admit that we tried poisoning those little fuckers. It didn't work, found cat's footprints all over my car. A neighbour (accomplice) found cat poop on his door mat."

Intigo,Guildwars2,1389915025.0,"It's chaotic and it's mayhem. GvG's are very fun to participate in (and you see the same groups winning consistently because of the skill it requires), but it is not a very good 'spectator sport'. GvG's consist of three primary 'groups' on each side: 

* Stacked melee ball. The melee stays together most of the time to keep the Boons and heals tight on your friendlies and your damage on the opponents a lot more compact. You try to catch people who miss a dodge roll or similar, then make sure you have people to pounce on them when they're downed (before they get bannered or ressed). If the melee ball is spread out you will be wasting Boons and valuable Water fields.

* Ranged, ie. Necromancers and Staff Elementalists, that try to keep their damage compact on your friendly melee leader while also keeping any Boons and heals rolling in on that. Positional awareness and an ability to stay alive under pressure from both a strong melee group and perimeter players is key to surviving in this role.

* Perimeter players, ie. Thieves/Mesmers/D/D Eles/some Necromancers. These guys are usually focused primarily on either taking out the enemy ranged players or the enemy perimeter players. Some can very smoothly transition between this role and ranged/melee such as a D/D Elementalist that may bomb with the melee group and switch off to help perimeter when needed. Usually perimeter consists of players and classes that do very well in solo or small scale situations as the fighting is sometimes similar to small scale WvW.

The reason it is very chaotic to you is because when in the middle of it, it will be hard to tell what's going on unless you've experienced it before. "

Unless she's taking hormones, we both know that there's no way she'll bulk up. Second, I'm not a trainer, so I'm not professionally qualified to give advice to beginners, to take what I say with a grain of salt. My opinion is that it's really important that she builds her confidence about how to use the equipment. How to execute proper form, proper tempo etc. Being new to lifting can be extremely intimidating. I think the best way to get her into it is have her follow you around for a few days. Do your exercises until she's comfortable, then get her on her own program. Good luck to you both!"

Exactly. I'm saying you need to look at the units involved and their likelihood as well as the direct percentages. A dollar is a small enough and common enough amount of money for most people that a difference of $7 isn't especially noteworthy. I'd estimate the likelihood that I have a dollar somewhere in my house that I don't know about at about 99.999%, so the likelihood that I have 7 dollars I don't know about is 99.93%. But if I had a million dollars that I knew about, the likelihood that I have another million dollars I don't know about is probably far less than just 99.99% * 1,000,000, which is a really really really really small number to begin with (3.7 x 10^-42 %)."

I had so much anger for the situation I was in. The thing was I was ready to take a loss at that point to improve my life. Turned out she was cheating on me so it worked out well in the long run. Now I'm having tons of success 6 months later.

I have heard Jewish mystics say it is like a mini death, but other than that, no.

&gt;ouldn't God have made Eve without causing Adam to ""die""?

They were co-creations. The Talmud (Mas. Chagiga) says Adam was made both genders, and that Eve was actually God splitting Adam into two people of both genders.

Just for a fun short idea on a deeper meaning in Genesis.

Day 1, creation. A true act of love.

Day 2, separation. This is judgement. You separate the good from the bad. In this case, light from the dark.

Day 3, first growth. What happens when you take creation (love) and allow it to mingle with the various elements (judgement)? You get growth, a combination. Mercy.

Basically: I'm sure the numbers in your algorithm work out that way, but the fact that you have a replacement-level QB who lost his job partway through the season that far ahead of the league MVP implies their may be a problem with your algorithm.  I guarantee that there isn't a single team in the league that would rather have Pryor starting than Peyton, even given the $18.5 million difference in their salaries.

So my recommendation is please, practice before you get married!

Having said that, I will suggest that using toys as a couple is like the pro version of sex. If the couple really has NO previous experience, they don't even know what their own bodies like, they have no idea what their partner likes, and they wouldn't know how to do it even if they knew. Start on the tutorial level maybe, with help of a Ob-GYN and maybe some movies (NOT regular porn - what people do in porn has little to do with actual sex between real people). Then start on level 1 as you develop intimacy and learn what works and doesn't work, both for your partner and yourself.

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1389915448.0,"Last week I talked with a run-of-the-mill feminist while doing some work. We ended up talking a good hour on feminism and the whole mess. I was actually taking TRP sides and she was agreeing. For instance, the whole crying issue. She thinks it should be okay for men to cry, just as much as women if it's needed, and men shouldn't be judged negatively for it. I then explained, it's not that simple. Men don't want to be seen as someone who cries. It's not a social thing, it's a personal thing. Crying is a sign of defeat or losing emotional control. ""How would you like it if your BF cried as frequently as you did? Seriously think about it. If he was crying that frequently, something is clearly wrong with the relationship, don't you think?"" She then responded with, ""You know, now that I think about it, I don't think I'd like it if he cried as much as me."" Obviously I am paraphrasing. 

Now this was a tumblr 3rd wave feminist who has made feminism a part of her life. She had no idea I was a piller, so when I brought these concepts up in neutral terms, it made a lot of sense. "

BullsLawDan,conspiratard,1389915460.0,"&gt;Strict constructionists prefer to put aside the Supreme Court's interpretation and look at what the term meant at the time the Constitution was adopted.

The Court did this in Wong Kim Ark and the prior decisions upon which Wong Kim Ark was based.  They did an extremely detailed review.

&gt;What I'm saying is, in the view of a strict constructionist, a new amendment to the Constitution would be necessary to define the term. 

Not really.  In the view of a strict constructionist, the term should be defined - by whomever defines it - in the way the Framers intended.

&gt;Most strict constructionists do not accept the Supreme Court's interpretations of articles and amendments. 

Says who?  

&gt;That is another issue entirely, but they do have some good arguments, as the Supreme Court was never formally given the power of judicial review and often contradicts itself.

Huh?  The Supreme Court was explicitly given the power of judicial review in Article 3, Section 2, of the Constitution, when the Constitution says that any disputes regarding the Constitution shall be heard by the Supreme Court or its inferior Courts as Congress may create."

- Not petty or jealous or immature.    
- Knows how to dress himself.    
- Keeps his surroundings neat, not a slob.    
- Can cook, or better yet, is a great cook.

- Taller than me. (I'm tall with short hair so I have a complex)    
- Deep voice (this is more of a sex thing)    
- Sexually adventurous and somewhat dominant. Loves giving and receiving oral.    
- Unconcerned with acquiring possessions, minimalist.    
- Physically active and encourages me to be the same.    
- Goal-oriented or plans for the future.    
- Frugal and saves for the future.    
- Extremely open with his feelings, good communication.    
- Interested in nonmonogamy.      
- Not petty or jealous or immature.    
- Dresses very well.    
- Very neat and clean.    
- Either cooks very well or budgets for great food. (I don't mind taking turns paying bills and stuff)    
- Well-educated and interested in a variety of subjects.    
- Compassionate.    
- Funny.

Right.  They have never heard a case about it, despite dozens if not hundreds of cases in which a party requested they do.  Ergo, they endorse the status quo.

&gt;The Wong case NEVER uses the term ""natural born citizen"".

So what?  It establishes that citizenship can accrue, in the United States, for almost anyone born on our soil.  It also establishes that there are two types of citizen, naturalized and native-born or natural-born.  So if someone is (1) a citizen, and (2) has not gone through the process of naturalization to become a citizen, they are a natural born citizen.

You're allowing any user to send any SQL and have it executed on https://github.com/kyledcline/bitcoin-rt/blob/master/comm-pg.php#L13

There is nothing stopping a user from passing through a malicious statement that does anything from dump out the entire contents of the database to deleting it. Whilst you may not care about that for this particular app, this is generally A Very Bad Thing(TM). All it takes is a little poke through the client side code to figure out that's what you're allowing, or even just having web developer tools logging http(s) requests to see it. 

Assume anything a user can send to your server side could be malicious. Program defensively (for SQL, use prepared statements). Whilst this may mean more work it will stop you from having unintended issues.

Czar-Salesman,SubredditDrama,1389915910.0,"&gt;&gt; You completely misunderstood what I said. What you mentioned is after you get appendicitis never before. We don't go around removing appendixes as baseline preventative because not everyone will get appendicitis.

&gt;I completely *understood* your point. But your point is entirely moot.  It makes no sense to circumcise someone *after* they get HIV or pass on HPV.  Neither does it make a great deal of sense to prefer to wait until one is an adult when the amount of pain is increased and the benefits of STD prevention decreased. 

The way to treat appendicitis is different than treating HIV, however the preventative step is similar, removal of the foreskin or appendix. However removal of the foreskin only decreases chance of transmission while removal of the appendix would 100% eliminate chance of appendicitis.

&gt;&gt; The worst false equivalent you could possibly choose.

&gt;Yet you do not say why. 

&gt;Smallpox was a scourge on this country's children for the majority of my childhood.  People died from it or suffered severe heart damage and or were physically mutilated from it.  A 1 cm scar on the arm for everyone eliminated that scourge for everybody. 
A smallpox vaccine prevents small pox, circumcision does not prevent STIs or STDs.

&gt;Today we have HIV.  Circumcision significantly cuts the risk of HIV transmission. Hardly a ""false equivalence""

HIV is no where near the issue small pox was, especially with modern medicine. Not to mention that you don't have to engage in sexual intercourse with someone who has smallpox in order to contract it.


&gt;&gt; This is the one and only semi valid argument that is brought up, except for the fact we have these things called condoms and that all STIs(even HIV) are manageable and as we progress will continue to diminish in severity of effect they have on people's lifves. 

&gt;And we all know that *everybody* uses condoms, right? (just like abstinence works??)  You know, come to think of it, we would not have needed those smallpox injections if everybody (friends, family) would have just stayed away from those infected.  If pigs had wings they could fly.

Some people might be stupid and not use condoms....so let's mutilate our children to reduce the risk of contracting HIV when they have unprotected sex with someone who has HIV.

&gt;&gt;Unnecessary and in my opinion an infringement on the child's human rights.

&gt;You keep saying that. Do you believe that vaccinations are infringements on children's rights?  

No, that's ridiculous to compare vaccines to circumcision like you continue to do. One is preventative the other kinda reduces your risk should you have unprotected sex with a carrier.


&gt;&gt; False equivalent. 

&gt;FYI - Using that term neither magically makes an argument you do not agree with actually a false equivalent

I felt it was pretty obvious how comparing vaccines to circumcisions was a false equivalent. 

&gt;&gt;Comparing a shot to removing part of the penis is ridiculous. Vaccines are scientifically ... circumcision is not in and of itself beneficial to someone who does not need it.
 
&gt;You just said above that it reduces STD transmission. How is this not beneficial to the future child and society as a whole?

Yeah it may reduce the chance, it does not prevent it. I don't see how you are missing that vital difference. Added in with modern medicine how far we've come in fighting HIV and with STDs and STIs.


&gt;&gt; Circumcision is text book genital mutilation. 

&gt;Can you cite a recent college level medical textbook which agrees with your opinion?  I'd be curious if you could find just one.

&gt;

&gt;

You really think a college level medical text book is required to be able to see at face value that circumcision is genital mutilation? I can help you with a dictionary if you'd like though.

We have circumcised infant males for religious and cultural reasons for a long time and only recently attempted to look for legitimate medical reasons to claim why it was OK to do so, the claims don't stand up to scrutiny. Its a backwards way of reasoning. "

I would feel comfortable telling my friend her new boyfriend is cute in a good-for-you kinda way, but if I said he was sexy that would seem like crossing a line. So those words just have wider applicability. I also think they emphasize face, whereas ""sexy"" could be about face, body, or both.

So no, cheating is not okay. Prudentially, it may be worth it to uphold the terms of the test to achieve an end (like passing the class). It might also be prudent to make a fuss about the cheating and negotiate a way to achieve your end (passing the class) without being forced to cheat, or be subjected to cheating.

As such the means of distribution that are common to the 21st century have disappeared quite a bit because the desire to take other people's work and profit off of it has disappeared.

Like, as if mass distribution and celebrity culture hadn't changed a culture than humans had had for hundreds if not thousands of years before that.

Really, the 20th and 21st century cultures of ownership, materialism and hero worship are rightly consigned to the history bin."

Chelsea won the first leg at Stamford Bridge 3-0, leaving my Spurs with a mountain to climb. 40 minutes in, we have one goal. Halftime comes, and I pull out my rarely used Aggressive ""I am not happy with your performance out there.""

All eleven players reacted positively, but now it's the hour mark and we still have just the one goal. ""The Game is About Glory"", I say, and set the team instructions to Overload, praying my aggressive center backs don't get themselves sent off as literally everyone else pours forward.

66th minute, a mere 3 minutes after the change in style, my fantastic regen striker puts one in the back of the net to make it 2-0. 83rd minute, he's done it again and we're level. Then at 90+1, my right winger lobs up a cross that my striker heads home to finish his hat trick and give us the 4-3 aggregate lead! After 2 more minutes added time, my Spurs have done the impossible and Sammy Macey becomes an instant club legend.

Harrier seats 1, typical airliner seats over 200. A typical airliner is not 2-3 times bigger, it's a bit more than that. 

We can look at weight too, max takeoff weight for a harrier jet is 14 tons, for a 787-9 it's over 250 tons. 

So yeah, the engines would have to be A LOT beefier, way beyond what we have these days.

I know people that have gotten pregnant, suffered thyroid issues, etc that people just ""call out"" for being fat, huge, whale-ish, and it's just so uncool. Disease, pregnancy, anything, can affect a person's weight and/or metabolism and it becomes an issue that is out of a person's control.

It's something that really shouldn't be so talked about, because, as a 6'5"" 150 pounder myself, guess what. *I know I'm ""skinny""*. You don't have to tell or remind me.

wrappedorange,AskMen,1389916551.0,"The parallel to your story would be women regarding looks. The public pressure of women to be attractive and attractiveness being the heaviest factor in judgement of one's value is pretty detrimental to a woman's self-esteem. Women, like the men you mention, too are rejected and ignored just as much as men if they don't fall into a certain range of attractiveness. It's just that these cases, we don't pay attention to because once again, we only highlight the people we deem attractive and blissfully ignore the majority. You could be intriguing, funny, caring and smart, but for a good amount of time be brushed off for being less than a physical standard. It happens more often than men assume for women, and thank god if it only ends rejection.  

Given that you are in this attractive zone doesn't make the situation easier since how would you know if the guy hitting on you is genuine or just in it for a lay? Being attractive also attracts very bad attention, people who would purposely deceive and lie to disarm a girl's defenses. Most people assume that an attractive girl has total control over her apparent advantage, but really it's case by case. And I've heard some bad cases

And this trend of ""leeching"" off a person's earned lifestyle doesn't just apply to men. A lot of those previously ignored women  get attention later in life because they have their shit together and seem like a good ""partner"" to have in a marriage. 

I can't write too well to speak on behalf of all women but this is what i've personally noticed. "

15 : Here we get to chose between, PoM, Blazing Speed and Ice Floes, all of which are viable to some extent. All of these can be stolen, purged(believe blazing can) etc. And the two I'd say is superior are PoM (my choice for situational/nuke (you can even do the ol' pom + alter time combo) or blazing speed for survivability.

30 : Temporal shield, flameglow, ice barrier.
Here, Ice Barrier seems to be the most common choice, however, by grabbing Incanter's ward at the end (only viable choice in pvp) we already have a shield, and since people are very fond of removing your ice barrier, I have lately preferred temporal shield, it is really good in pinches, and can be used through stuns (when other people deep you!) and all the fun nukes.

45: Ring of frost. NEXT

60: I'll keep this one short, all of these are fun, but I'd say nothing beats cold snap for survivability in pvp. Heal, CD reset, 2x iceblock etc.

75: Bombs, I'd also like to say this is optional. I always prefer living bomb over frostbomb since its instantcast, easy to keep up, good damage and very versatile.

90: Incanter's ward. The other 2 are just immobilizing you.

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1389916668.0,"Back in 2008 I helped with the Obama campaign when he was the bee's knee's. It was pretty early in his run but we were still getting a lot of volunteers. So one day we spent a good 10 hours going over training as a regional leader focusing on mainly acquiring and managing volunteers. 

The part that I initially felt a little uncomfortable with was the part of the training that included relationship building. It was for all intents and purposes social strategy, or, how to behave like a leader and get people to do what you need them to do effectively. It was very upfront about: When meeting a new person, immediately engage into them personally and find something in common to talk about. Then invest something into them (time, opportunity, an event) so they'll feel obligated to return the favor. When leading, be clear in your objectives and set clear goals. Don't let them make goals for themselves when it's not necessary. Make it clear that you don't want to be let down. Again, continue investing into the relationship and forming a cohesive group. When working on a project or campaign together, be their friend, but separate yourself just enough so they still understand that you are their leader. Get personal, but not TOO personal. Let them be as personal as they want with others, but make sure they don't get too personal with you as well. 

These are strategies on forming and managing successful teams. They are not ""natural"" to most people, so they are discussed and clearly drawn out. And it did feel uncomfortable at the time, I'll admit it. It didn't feel right doing actions that I didn't think were natural. But you know what? Just like TRP's sexual strategy, after a while, your mind naturally starts internalizing these behaviors because these behaviors are successful. The initial times where I felt obligated and strange falsely investing into someone in hopes of a return favor no longer felt fake. Now when I encountered these situations they were genuine interactions. I actually did care about who they were and what they were about. I actually wanted to do something nice for them. I enjoyed forming these positive relationships. 

What I find strange is that no one bats an eye when it's about discussing social strategy openly. But soon as you try to discuss romantic/sexual strategy, all of a sudden there is outrage. "

The cave's largest crystal found to date is 12 m (39 ft) in length, 4 m (13 ft) in diameter and 55 tons in weight. The cave is extremely hot with air temperatures reaching up to 58 °C (136 °F) with 90 to 99 percent humidity. The cave is relatively unexplored due to these factors.

SlimeQSlimeball,HomeImprovement,1389917110.0,"Oh my god I actually have something to contribute to reddit finally!

This mess is an AT&amp;T Uverse installation. 

What you are looking at is the MPOE (minimum point of entry) the thick black cable is the telephone line from the pole (or likely, a buried pedestal since this looks to be buried wire, could be going buried to the pole and the aerial, I digress) and the thick black pieces are the lightning protectors. The grey box hanging off is what we call a VDSL Splitter Filter. It splits (duh) the telephone signal and DSL signal. The little clear plastic toggles are for telephone (red/green) and data (black/yellow). You don't have POTS (traditional phone service) or there would be a wire pair in that toggle. The line stapled to the wall is going to your modem.

That said, this installation is shit. We do not use the old style protectors for uverse, you should have a plastic box (NID)with a modern protector and the splitter should be mounted inside it, ground tagged, circuit tagged, the wire from the outside should be bonded (grounded to the common ground on the protector), etc. At least the cat5 was secured to the wall and he used the right wire color (green) for data. Sheesh.

The rest of the installation is probably as bad. My apologies. If you just had this installed, make them come back out and fix it correctly. You can't be billed on repairs for 90 days after service activation. Call them at 800-288-2020 if it's in service, if not you can disregard it and cut back the splitter filter."

ibbity,AskWomen,1389917112.0,"I see women dismissing it as ""That's their culture and we can't impose our Western ideas on them""; talking about how they went to whatever country and didn't experience the kind of sexism that the women there are known to, so they don't believe that it's as serious as it's made out to be; saying that the women probably live that way because they choose to; other things as well. Mostly it's these three. 

There was a post on TwoX a little while ago with a photoset of women gradually covering more and more of their bodies, as is required or very strongly pressured in some majority-Islamic countries, and most of the comments were exactly like I've just described. Almost NO ONE even mentioned the fact that the women in those countries who are covering themselves (among other, much worse human rights issues) do so because they MUST or else risk beatings, arrest, violent physical or sexual assault, and/or rape, and they will be blamed for those assaults for ""not being modest enough and tempting men"" if the word gets out. (Remember the Afghan schoolgirls who burned to death because the police locked them in their burning school to prevent them coming outside without their veils?)

These are societies where rape victims are sometimes forced to marry their rapists and rape victims who become pregnant are sometimes killed, where women can be killed just because someone suspected that they might possibly have been having some kind of relationship with a man. Honor killings are in no way a thing of the past in some areas of the world, and it really makes me angry to see middle class white western feminists act like the terrible treatment of women in some countries is not really an issue because ""it's their culture.""

redwhiskeredbubul,PurplePillDebate,1389917425.0,"&gt; Our culture reflects our nature. It doesn't create it.

Except that if you think about it for a second, this clearly isn't true. Mules are created nature. So are domestic bananas, domesticated dogs, the greenhouse effect, and trans people who get gender reassignment surgery. Most of the natural environment you see is 'second nature'--there is almost no original growth, say, in the United States or Europe, what you see with the forest along the highway is secondary growth that was planted there. 

&gt;These differences show up even in other species, where your ""social construct"" treacle cannot possibly explain them.

But other species have pretty different ways of dealing with biological sex, and they don't have clear gender expectations. Mushrooms don't have sex difference. Sunfish can change their sex midway through life. And so on. What's distinctive about human beings is that we alter our natural environment, and we do it in part through our ideas about gender. 

&gt;You guys love to point to outliers as though they completely invalidate the majority. 

I mean, what I've cited here aren't outliers. But the thing is that we treat different outliers differently. If somebody has an unusual chromosome configuration (say, single X, or triple x) we treat them as women. If they feel themselves to be a different gender from their chromosomes, we alter their physical appearance. Gender takes precedence. "

Right off the bat, one obese police officer is making demands (ordering him to sit down and tell him his name, which Thomas has a constitutionally protected right to not give) while twirling his baton in a threatening manor in one hand, and his other hand on his gun.  

If Thomas was informed of his Constitutional rights, he would have walked away.  But he wasn't. 

Instead the obese cop continued to demand Thomas to do things he wasn't obligated to do.  The obese cop manhandles Thomas even though he is sitting peacefully.  A 2nd cop shows up with baton out and immediately starts beating him.  The obese cop joins in on the beating. 

Other police show up and ask wtf happened, and the 2 cops explain that they were forced to, ""Beat his face to hell.""

The odds of blocking out a star are pretty miniscule unless the enemy's right up in your face (in which case your odds of hiding from them are probably zero, except perhaps with a cloaking device, which appears to work even at extremely close ranges, as seen in ST6 and other places, although with disadvantages such as tachyon emissions).

I've tried all sorts of meds, and nothing has worked. I'm starting CBT tomorrow, because I need to get out of this horrible pattern of frustration and disappointment and stress. I can't handle the downs anymore - they're just accompanied with thoughts of 'look; stop kidding yourself. You'll be a burden, no one will want to be around you because you're always sad and useless.

topdnbass,summonerschool,1389917472.0,"Definitely, good points. The following is a little off-topic but hey its summoner school and it's some good info.  
Pushing your bot lane is extremely important for a few reasons (here we go again):  
1.) Hitting level 2 first means you can win trades.  
2.) Getting the turret = gold = good.  
3.) Dragon/vision/map control, if the enemy duo is low hp and pressured to the turret they won't be able to come contest dragon as easily and wont be able to ward. This makes lane gank opportunities for your jungler/roamers. They'll be to busy clearing the minions off turret so you can even sneak a dragon. If they have been under turret for 3 minutes you know that dragon is probably not warded.  
If you take the turret you deny some vision and push them back further, and gain map control (free drags).   
4.) Win trades via minion damage. If you are pushing you have more minions, so if they engage or try to harass you, they will take more minion damage, not to mention miss cs.  
ALSO, you are pretty free to harass them because they are too busy trying to not miss cs, and they don't have as many minions so the return damage will be negligible.      
5.) Turret shots will make it harder for them to cs. Nobody cs's perfectly under turret!

A minor 6th. ADC's under turret will have a harder time lifestealing because they'll be waiting for turret shot to last hit. Basically the turret will be taking the ""potential life"". This means harass sticks better.  
Of course a good adc will attack back line minions meanwhile, but a lot don't."

keakealani,weddingplanning,1389917509.0,"Fortunately, my state is gender non-discriminatory when it comes to name changes associated with marriage (this was true before we passed marriage equality, but even more true now as the language in marriage documents is all gender neutral)

So we're both changing our names. I wanted to preserve my maiden name for personal and professional reasons, while still honoring the choice we made to start a family unit and keep a unified name for that family unit. Plus his name is actually more interesting than mine so it makes for a generally more interesting name altogether. 

Conveniently, my maiden name is the very common construction &lt;name&gt;son (e.g., Johnson, Stevenson, etc.) and his middle name was, in fact, the &lt;name&gt; portion, so changing his name is actually just adding three letters to his existing name. I'm keeping my middle name so I'll have two surnames, but not hyphenated. The lack of hyphen is intentional, not just because of the flak I hear about hyphenated names (it's totally undeserved, but I don't want to deal with that) and because I feel it enables me to better use one name or the other for social or professional reasons when necessary.

Of course, name changes are a very personal thing and I don't believe they should be nearly as politicized and judged as they are, but there you have it. -shrug-"

Slyfox00,TheLastAirbender,1389917701.0,"&gt;Now i'm going to have to make some charts to verify this stuff. Off hand this is how I see it: Kyhu, Beroberos and Sherbies are the big 3 making up about 33% of korrasami. The next 33% is distributed among several other talented, but less frequently posting korrasami shippers. And the last 3rd is made up of one offs, sporadic shippers, unknown artists, and miscellaneous korrasami stuff.

So I did the footwork.

Of over 400 submissions:

[104 submissions that make up about a quarter of /r/korrasami. This is the big three: Kyhu, Beroberos and Gingervora.](http://i.imgur.com/CMteuV8.png)


[110, or about another 4th, go to an assortment of Korrasami Shippers.](http://i.imgur.com/hYXwlqL.png)


And the remaining 194 submissions, nearly half, belong to 170 one off submitters.

grafxbill,graphic_design,1389917730.0,"Same boat here pal.  I've developed an extensive freelance operation as a result of dull and misinformed opinions on design in the office.

I went through three phases over the last 3 years.  

Phase 1: Upon receiving poor suggestions, I tried to work with it.  I tried to consistently deliver excellent creative, despite what they wanted me to do to it.  I tried to give everything my mark and my seal of approval.  Ultimately, this led me to phase 2.

In phase 2, I was pissed off.  I never wanted to work, I tried to do as little as possible, and when tasked with something that required ""team"" approval, I procrastinated.  I procrastinated until the very last moment until I knew I had enough time to finish it, but barely under the gun.  I'm talking upwards of 6GB of entire environment graphics in a half-day.  

I'm now in phase 3.  Phase 3 is the 'I don't give a shit anymore phase'  As a result of being forced to do piss-poor creative and chained to a desk for 8 hours a day, now I exist to serve the company's needs, but I do everything as fast as possible.  They have a ""look"" to the marketing materials that I think is just cluttered, unorganized, lacks focus, and is generally reprehensible.  I've learned to swim with the current, give them what they want very quickly with the ""look"" so I know once I send it out, no one will disapprove of it.  They've never been happier, I've never been happier, and once I finish their work, I tend to my freelance work where I can deliver awesome creative daily.  I bring my laptop in and work on it, and no one asks any questions.

I just got tired of swimming upstream all the time; it's not worth it.  I would have quit long ago but 1) I was still learning in my position, even though it was shitty.  I was learning about how to defend my ideas, how to explain shit to people who don't know squat, and even though I ultimately gave up trying to be an innovator, it helped me get where I am, 2) I'm paid very well, and 3) I have lots of time to freelance.

That's my story, hopefully you can relate."

arcsecond,DaystromInstitute,1389917772.0,"&gt;  examples of other species' cultural products in Klingon opera

I'd like to point out that we have no evidence that the Klingon Operas are contemporary works of art. These could be ancient operas performed since time immemorial. What were once stories to boast of battles, told around campfires and in mead halls, over time became classical high art.

1) Humans aren't supposed to care about profit anymore. It's art for art's sake no matter what. And even in a profit-less system, there's the currency of reputation. I think a defining characteristic of 24th century humans is a desire to master skills and topics, especially amongst the top ranks of Starfleet, humanity's ""best and brightest"" so to speak.

2) There must be something. Dr. Bashir is always getting new holodeck programs from somewhere. Someone recommended/talked about them. Perhaps it's all gone viral and media only spreads by word of mouth.

3) See above.

4) In Voyager's finale Endgame we learn that Tom Paris has become a holo-novelist. The Doctor publishes a holo-novel. It appears to me that all contemporary human cultural products have simply the prefix ""holo-"" affixed to them.

I've noticed lately the resurgence in popularity of period and costume dramas. Downton Abbey for instance. There are a bunch of other shows set just-post-WWII right about now. A human interest in the past is nothing new."

I use coconut oil at the moment but it doesn't completely remove my colorstay makeup so I have to double cleanse with my Clarisonic. I live in NZ so don't have access to Bioderma :(


5. As an oily skinned girl, should I be staying away from highlighters? I've never used them before but bought the Nars guy bourdin palette recently and it came with that gorgeous highlighter. 


6. Whats the difference between contouring and applying bronzer to the hollows of your cheeks? Should i be doing both or is it the same thing?"

I've completely missed a couple of dungeons because I leveled out of them too fast just by parking in SW and running random PUGs. I've nearly skipped entire ZONES just by running several dungeons trying to get better weapons and gear. That is insane. 

I know it makes sense for people trying to get to endgame, but I LOVE leveling. At one point, I turned off exp just so I could do everything.

I was in lust with this 16 year old girl named Mandy. She was a bottle blonde, great body, more than a little bit slutty, and 13 year-old me (who'd already been reading my Dad's Penthouse Forums for a few years), was all over getting into that. 

I made it very clear, and you could tell she enjoyed the attention. She'd come over to our house to sunbathe, because we had a deck, but it's not like the sun was any brighter on our back porch than in her back yard. 

Only at our place, she could lounge in her bikini and drive me wild - make little comments about how she needed to trim down there, because some wispies were poking out, etc. 

Finally, one day, I just flat out asked her, and she said, ""I would, but I can't.""

""Why can't you?""

""Oh, I promised my sister Jennifer that I wouldn't get laid until I got her laid.""

Now, her sister Jennifer was my age, and unlike her svelte, sexy older sister Mandy...Jennifer was a big girl. In my cruel, misguided youth, I would have described her as a beach ball with arms and legs, girl was round. 

And yet, 13 year old hormones may know cruelty, but they do not know pride. 

""That's it?,"" I asked, ""Cause, I'd hit that in a heartbeat if it meant I got a shot at you.""

""Oh would you?,"" eyelash flutter, tease, tease, tease...

""Damn right I would.""

So, later that week, after the particulars had been worked out, I climbed Mountain Jen and eagerly went to town for the perhaps 10 minutes that a precocious 13 year-old virgin who'd already whacked it about 5 times that day could last. We were both satisfied at the result if not at the proficiency. 

I reported my success to Mandy the next day, and she'd already gotten an earful of coitus joy from Jen. So I was all set on that front. 

Needless to say, she held up her end of the deal ...for a couple of hours (and a few times more after that too - I'd read those Penthouses carefully and learned a lot). 

So yeah...my first time...dm;hs. But my second (through seventh) time, now those were memories worth banking. "

geeked_outHyperbagel,childfree,1389918420.0,"&gt;  *I keep to myself and don't bother anyone. I'm actually the happiest one in my family.*

This is probably not coincidence.  That's not a bad statement about your family, it's just a statement I find generally true.  Those who are happiest tend to mind their own business and live life as they see fit with minimal interference from others. 

&gt; *There's also a heightened sense of pride for people with kids.*

Someone stated it very eloquently on /r/childfree, I don't know who or where, but it went something like this: ""Once a person has kids, it becomes literally unthinkable to imagine they might have made a mistake. It would be too crushing."" 


&gt; *My mom gets depressed after talking to her and then she pressures me again. It's a constant battle.*

Establishing and maintaining personal boundaries is one way to avoid this battle.  ""Mom, I love you very much but the topic of me having children is off the table. I will no longer discuss it.""  That might be hard to say, and harder to maintain , but it is worth it.  Nobody has the right to make you feel guilty for your life choices.  Nobody has the right to make you talk about things you don't want to talk about.  Not even your parents. 

I wish you all the best, it sounds like you and your boyfriend are living a super happy life! :)

And no, you can't change idiots, but you can change the environment in which they operate. If posting misogynistic bullshit like this is made against the rules, and violators get downvoted in extremis or reported and banned, they'll eventually stop spewing their asshattery on here. No, it's not at all easy to change an environment, but I think it's well worth the effort. Hundreds of people took the time to comment and say that you can't change idiots or that it's the fault of women for not hiding that they were women. You alone have commented on this thread dozens of times, trying to emphasise that you can't change idiots and that it's not worth the trouble and that women should just deal with it. If instead of spending all that time bitching about how things can't change, you'd simply been quiet, or better yet, posted a brief comment saying that you'd like things to change, you'd have done an awful lot. Changing an environment isn't difficult because of the small percentages of people who act like idiots, it's difficult because a large percentage of people stand up for those idiots. You're standing up for those idiots. Every time you bother to comment about how idiots won't change, you're making the environment a little friendlier for misogynistic bullshit and a little less friendly too women.

aidenr,Christianity,1389918837.0,"I would like to offer a completely different response.

The Bible presents God as intentional. That tells us that God's position is that our lives and our decisions have meaning. Without a contrast between what is in line with that intent and what is out of line, there can be no ability on our part to discern what is right. Therefore, it can be no other way than that there must be a clear difference between the consequences of the options presented to us.

If there were no hate and no suffering and no pain, it would be hard or impossible to devise any system by which to discover what is intended for us. We do not need more than the contrast between life and death to know that we have a duty to do right.

The original comment reveals a person whose faith was drowned in the mediocrity of his parents' life and a lack of consequential outcomes from the religious organization. He, just like you, is imbued with the mandate to learn from experience so we should be compassionate that his life is so chaotic that he cannot see what we believe is right in front of him.

Those of you who mocked his doubt should be deeply ashamed of your decision to sit in judgment. When a person shares like that, nobody should be more proud than to say ""there but for the grace of God go I."""

However a couple parts were much cheaper than any of the alternatives (I use 0.100 header connectors by the hundreds/thousands and they're by far the cheapest place I've found).

On to your second paragraph, your sentence structure is terrible and implies that it's a country that disposes of vessels owned by private corporations within its borders. And then it implies that because something is done means it is cheap, without any citation. According to [this article by the US Navy](http://www.navsea.navy.mil/teamships/Inactiveships/Ship_Disposal/default.aspx), dismantling that barge would cost seventeen million, seven hundred and ten thousand dollars. If you don't think that's costly, I know where you can stick it.

You're quite right about not knowing shit about barge technology. Let's look at a typical as you call it 2013 model barge. A company by the name of Greenbrier makes barges. They made the biggest one in the world, actually. Their latest model is a big box of metal that floats. That's leaps and bounds ahead of their 2000 model, which was a big metal box that floats. That company wasn't around back then, but imagine the heritage if they had existed to create some of the early ones in North America like the 1870's wonder- dubbed ""the big wooden box that floats""."

codayus,BDSMcommunity,1389919018.0,"&gt;  I essentially went from having extremely vanilla sex a couple of times with my high school boyfriend to being able to live out all of the fantasies I'd had with another person.

I don't think there's any issue with that *per se*.  If you aren't vanilla, there's little-to-no value in having vanilla sex.

&gt; I fear how our age-play/incest kink especially will effect our relationship outside of the bedroom. So far it doesn't seem to be a problem but I'm afraid that problems might arise.

I also don't think there's any particular reasons why this would be the case.  I mean...obviously you may find that as time goes on your relationship isn't strong and healthy.  But that is, in my view, just as possible (and no less likely) with a vanilla relationship.  :)

&gt; What if I get too old for him to find me sexy any more? I know I have quite a few years to go before I hit my mid to late 20's which is what he considers old now. But what if by the time I hit that stage that number hasn't raised for him and he ditches me for younger girls?

I can see where that's a major concern for you.  However...

...there are really two main options here.

1. He has a fetish for girls in their late teens, full stop.  (Or perhaps even earlier, but he feels unable to express that.)  As and when you stop matching this fetish he will cease to be attracted to you.
2. He has a fetish for age-play, incest play, DD/lg stuff, and, generally speaking, the dynamic that you now have.  There's no reason that needs to ever change, because it has nothing to do with your physical age.

My relationship with my SO has some elements of DD/lg and age-play, and she's quite a bit younger than me (currently 20, I'm in my 30s), but neither of us has any concerns about her getting older, because neither of us have any kinks that relate to her age, per se.  We love the power imbalance, the love and care, ""Daddy"" putting her socks and shoes on before going out, tucking her into bed at night and giving her a kiss on the forehead, etc., etc.  It's lovely (for us), and I imagine it'll still be lovely when she's in her 40s and I'm in my 50s.  :)

So I guess what I'm getting at is that if your partner is into **AGE PLAY**, then there's no concern; you're never too old to, eg, tell Daddy you'll let him touch you ""down there"" if he buys you that glittery nail polish you want , or however you like to express that kink.  If he's into **teenagers** then you have major issues, because that's not really about make believe at all.

But you describe your kinks as ""heavy age-play"", and I think that's probably a very good sign.  The more your play sessions involve pretending to be something your not, the less what you actually physically are matters.

TL;DR:  You can be a little forever, but you're only a teenager once.  Figure out what your partner is into.  :)"

But, beyond that, automatically disqualifying someone from leadership because they are too old is a dangerous concept.

What defines too old?

40? 50? 90? (Ok, 90 is a little unrealistic, because even with our modern medicine a 90 year old is at risk of just keeling over.)

But, that is the point. Age is a not that important of a thing in my opinion.

If there was a candidate that was 36 years old and a candidate that was 66 years old that had identical political ideals and identical campaign promises, I would vote for the older one. Because he/she would simply have more life experience.

aprildh08,AskWomen,1389919198.0,"&gt; I randomly get horny all the time. If that statement is true, she should to.

Is literally what you said. Women do get randomly horny, all the time. What you seem to be expecting is that *every* time a man gets randomly horny, a woman should also be horny enough for semi-immediate sex. No. That is not how it works. Sometimes I'm randomly horny when my boyfriend isn't, it would be *unfair* of me to demand that he get hard at my whim and fuck me.

What's the longest long-term relationship you've been in? Have the women you've been with been short-term or one-night stands or friends with benefits, or in some other relationship dynamic that was based around sex as its primary focus? Or are they long-term relationships? Because the former type is of course going to want to focus on **mutual** pleasure, which, with a non-long-term relationship is probably going to take more foreplay."

If you know that you're eligible for deductions that aren't listed on the W-4 (like tuition or charitable donations), you might take an extra allowance so you keep more of your paycheck, but get a smaller refund.  

Likewise, if you had to pay in extra to the IRS the previous year, you could take one less allowance so your employer pulls more from your check, and you don't have to pay in as much (if any).  

If you're working a salaried job, it's a bit easier to estimate how much your total tax bill will be since you know exactly how much you'll make in a year.  You can plug that in to an online tax calculator and compare that against what your employer is withholding in taxes.  Hourly jobs are harder, because you income varies based on how much you work.  

Oh, and keep in mind that you can fill out a new W-4 any time (you don't have to do it at the beginning of the year, or whatever).  Just ask your super-nice payroll lady for a new form!"

Like I said you aren't free to simply interpret what people say however it suits you. There was no implication that he felt oppressed. Oh and yes he did correct you.

&gt;I did not disregard his points.  I addressed them.  If I missed one, show me.

You derailed onto discussing how evey group has assholes when his point was not that feminism contains assholes but rather its dogmatic nature restricts criticism, such as religious beliefs does. In other words feminists do not act in a social, political, or analytical manner but rather in a manner a religious zealot would. Not all, but it is pretty close to mainstream for their popular online communities and websites to be dogmatic and act like zealots.

&gt;I meant it in a lighthearted way at first when I called him an ass (it's not exactly a super harsh insult or anything).

tomfishtheGR8,AskMen,1389919525.0,"Here are a few of my favorites. 

Writing: I know it's cliché, but get out of the house (maybe take a walk on foot or bike) and find a nice coffee shop, and post up for a few hours. It's crucial that you leave the house and find a ""work"" space, where you are less tempted to start surfing the net, playing video games, ect. White noise like people chatting really helps me get into my own little zone and lose myself, so I like coffee shops or diners. Celtx is a great program that lets you write in bunch of different formats and it's completely free! 


Making music: A lot of people are telling you to pick up and learn an instrument, and that's great, but if you get some very basic music software you can take things to the next level and start composing things on the computer. You can record instruments, your own voice, or just fuck around with creating synth sounds. Whatever you think sounds good is right. I find making weird little songs really therapeutic. 


Art/Fim/Music Blogs: Find some blogs from your city and make checking them part of your routine. Where I live, there are some great blogs that let you RSVP and get on discounted/free guest lists to lots of cool stuff. People always like getting tipped off to discounted tickets or ""secret"" shows, so it makes asking coworkers or acquaintances to come out with you less awkward if you have something like that to offer. 

Have fun!

fiat_lux_,TheBluePill,1389919718.0,"&gt;  If I'm recalling correctly somewhere in the neighborhood of 15-20% of the German male population died during WWII. That's a period of five years, never mind what you would get for lifetime incidence of violent death in combat. In general, the axis powers had high rates of male deaths because most of the people who died were combatants.

Not just the Axis. 

If I'm recalling correctly myself, USSR had the highest casualties in WW2 and about a quarter of the Soviet men were killed. Some age groups had up to 80% of the men wiped out.

&gt; and while the idea that 'men die in war' is also a myth, there are limited senses in which it is true.

That's a myth?

I understand the desire to trivialize male disposability among some groups, but even if it *was* a myth that ""men die in war"" (I don't think it is), 

1. we don't all come from Western backgrounds

2. when Westerners talk of male disposability, they are referring to collection of issues including vagrancy, suicides, etc, which overwhelmingly affect males but often get brushed under the rug. Not just war. They are legitimate concerns."

I stippled mine (as you can see) but I've seen examples that are stitched straight across in like .5""-1"" intervals that looked very neat and modern.

I like /u/Goldie2000's ideas about showcasing the patterns, but I also want to warn you that this quilt is going to be loved and heavily abused by its recipient and washed lots, so make sure you anchor your starting and ending threads very well if you're doing a lot of picking up your presser foot. I also machine stitched the binding on the back so it was better secured instead of hand stitching like normal. "

My dad eventually rescued me after he found out where I was, He then took the time to listen to me and try to understand, but even then his told me to 'suck it up' and then said  'grandma is 76 and she has the same condition, stop being a wuss'

Sometimes parents just don't think. they want to fix the problem as fast as possible because they do care, but they lack the skills to know how to help you properly.

The boats also became woefully outdated once radar and allied improved sonar became commonplace. 


To put how far away they were from winning the war, 99% of all allied shipping completed their journeys. If Hitler and Raeder didn't adore capital ships so much and actually devoted their production to a massive oceangoing Uboat fleet, they may have had a chance. I'm talking around 1000 size fleet, and the logistics behind making space for all of those boats, arming those boats, repairing, training, etc. would be absolutely horrendous."

Sunfried,explainlikeimfive,1389920121.0,"What you want is an [Inflatable Space Tower](http://www.space.com/6867-inflatable-space-tower-proposed.html).  

Well, it can be rigid instead of inflatable to perform the function, but if you can build a tower light enough and strong enough (and this would be mega-engineering on a mountaintop), you can pressurize the inside (to sea-level pressure, or maybe higher), float your spacecraft up 20 miles (after somehow getting the spaceship to the mountaintop... hmm), and then fire it away.  20 miles of free lift would still represent a substantial energy savings (well, 10-20% at most) over ground-launch: rocket engines are incrementally more efficient when there's less atmosphere (think of the thrust pushing against the air as it exits the nozzle), and you'd save a lot of fuel just because you'd spend less time climbing on your rocket engines.  

If you read that article, you can see the reference to David Brin's 1980 book *Sundiver*, which alluded to a pair of such towers, called the Chocolate Needle and Vanilla Needle, which worked in this fashion. *Sundiver* is the first novel of the *Uplift* universe."

Tripi,Parenting,1389920133.0,"From what you've written, the teacher has no reason to worry that he may became violent, as that's just not something he's ever done before. Perhaps she needs to be assured that that's not something that is an issue for your son. 

To spend 3-4 hours looking for glasses seems long enough to make anyone feel very upset, especially if during that time they had trouble seeing. I would have trouble not turning that in to a mountain if it happened to me (thanks for sharing that tactic btw, I'll use it on my own kids). I can only imagine it would have been more helpful if your son had asked for help - perhaps he did? - but if he doesn't feel comfortable asking the teacher for help in that sort of situation, (perhaps he senses that she doesn't really like him?), then that's something that I would work on with him also - teaching him how to ask for help when he needs it. 

One avenue may be to ask the psychologist to speak with the teacher, or write a letter, outlining strategies, concerns, etc. If the concerns are fairly mild, and nothing to do with being violent, then that could help the teacher understand your son better. "
ballepung,AskMen,1389920134.0,"When in doubt, always aim for the middle-ground.

I personally don't want my girl to be particularly introverted nor extroverted. But if I have to choose one of them, then I'm gonna choose an extrovert any day of the week. In my opinion, introversion doesn't come across as feminine or charming at all. I cannot remember meeting even one truly introverted girl, who also had good looks and charm. That might be because the vast majority of girls are at least *a little* extroverted(my impression).

Being sociable, easy to talk to, and generally pleasant to be around, are all good traits that I value in women. But being loud and showing clear signs of confidence, is unattractive. In fact, that's even worse than being super shy.

Go for the middle-ground, leaning slightly more to the extroverted side, and you're gold."

You seem to have missed when I said ""The only real unnatural thing about dressage is putting it all together in **controlled concise movements**."" For someone so eager to post random quotes and overanalyze, you seem to have missed that one.

But, I am trying to find a video that will hopefully satisfy you. I've come across [this one](http://youtu.be/pWMJ0Op98-I?t=2m11s) which you can see the horses trotting around and bouncing.
More clips [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ownGEOFFPvM) with similar motions.
[Here](http://youtu.be/UfRTZ7JVRXM?t=53s) is a bit of an extended trot, right on the dot and more later on.

Most clips of wild horses online are of them eating, or fighting so finding the specific behaviors you are asking for is a bit difficult with what is provided. No matter what I feel the footage will not live up to your standards as you dont really know what you're looking for since you're holding wild horses to the expectations of horses that have been trained to compete for ~7 years and master the specific movements.

Edit: To add on, the dressage horses in competition also have very controlled diets and exercise as well as grooming, so from the get go they're going to look far more manicured and graceful than the wild horses. Try not to let the flashiness fool you too much!"

It was fun using petty cash to go buy a blu ray player + the equipment to connect it to the Christie-2000 + Dolby Digital system.

After we went full digital, they actually sent us blu ray copies they themselves produced. I mean, at least keeping it classy.

As a note of awesome, the first thing I did after installing the blu ray player was 'test the system' was watch an episode of Firefly (it was the only thing I had on blu ray at the time). Ended up watching the whole series on the big screen over the course of a week. It was awesome."

TyrannyMcbane,AdviceAnimals,1389920581.0,"Wow, you didn't get my point at all. I was saying that as a parent, she was probably used to ""normal teen things"" like truancy and smoking, etc., and that's what she knows how to deal with. When confronted with this, she had an absolute panic moment and reacted with what she already knows. My point was that this parent needs to learn that there **is** a huge difference and develop a new strategy for helping her daughter. I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt, thinking maybe she's not a shitty parent, maybe she was just overwhelmed and reacting with the tools she knew best, even though it was completely inappropriate.

None of this matters since op is 22 and it all happened in the past. It's too late for her mom to learn, or for me us to specualte whether she was an uncaring bitch or someone who didn't know what to do and had a knee-jerk reaction"
Hovsky,gaming,1389920582.0,"&gt;namely that tolerance is the deviation they've allowed in the design for the gun to still work?

No, it isn't whether it'll still work. It's if the part will pass their QC. It might be outside tolerances and still work, or it might be inside tolerances and not work (poor design).

&gt;I did actually mean that the reason they notoriously fail to jam is that the design allows a lot of slop.

It does, yes. Large design clearances will allow more variation, because it has a greater margin. Parts won't bind if a 0.05"" clearance is off by 0.02"", whereas parts with 0.01"" would.

DuckyFreeman,AskReddit,1389920645.0,"Motion, magnetism, and electricity are all related. 

motion + magnetism = electricity (generator)  
electricity + magnetism = motion (electric motor)  
motion + electricity = magnetism (electromagnet)

Wireless charging uses the first and last of those. The motion, in their case, is from AC, alternating current. As the electrons accelerate from (+) to (-) voltage, they create a pulsing magnetic field. A coil of wires in the receiving device takes the pulsing magnetic field (which acts like relative motion between the field and the device) and outputs electricity. 

This is also how the [transformers](http://s3.freefoto.com/images/13/20/13_20_73_web.jpg) on power poles work. They have a coil of wire being fed by distribution lines, sitting inside of a coil the outputs power to homes. By controlling the number of windings between the two coils, you can alter the voltage and current. "

The takeaway I got was that you don't have to go to college to be successful: you can work your way up. I was a bit alarmed when it appeared that Mike had passed, but I like how it was resolved. I like that characters didn't apologize for lying, and then the adults say ""that's ok, we'll make an exception for you because you told the truth!"" Instead, the characters tell the truth but still have to suffer the consequences for their actions. But they realize they have other ways to realize their life goals. I thought it was a great story for kids to know that even if your original plan doesn't work out, it doesn't mean you can't still reach your goal in another way.

I also liked that Mike was passionate about what he wanted, but he couldn't fix the fact that he wasn't scary. I liked the subversiveness of the message that it's NOT true to say ""you can be anything you want as long as you put your mind to it!"". Instead, Mike learned he could still achieve a similar goal better tailored to his real strengths."

That's why.  He gave us a DRM that rewards us for using it when all the others were piles of shit.  Steam may have its faults, but it doesn't make the service a detriment.  Sales, social integration, seamless mod support, autoupdating (if you remember what it was like to patch a game in the old days, this is a HUGE one).

Not to mention, steam is what revitalized the PC industry.  Distributors/publishers were taking their developers to consoles by the masses and abandoning the platform, steam came in and launched a multibilliondollar industry seemingly by itself.  And the most insane part of that is... it didn't turn into EA to do it.

When people joke that he saved PC gaming, there's a grain of truth to that.  Steam sales more than its DRM are one of the biggest reasons piracy has dwindled in recent years..."

I had LASIK surgery, and Lasik guarantees that your eyes will have dryness problems for a few months after surgery, so I got really familiar with dryness symptoms.  (You also can't rub your eyes for about a month after surgery, not once.)  I got really good with eyedrops, and I now recognize that my eyes were randomly dry all the time before surgery, but I never thought of it as dryness.

If you do get eyedrops, don't get vasoconstrictors (Clear Eyes, Visine) or astringents (astringent is anything that makes your tissue contract-- good for closing pores, puckering pickles, closing shaving cuts, etc.), which fight redness-- redness is a symptom of irritation (and other things), but they do a shit job at treating the irritation.

My dad got me an acoustic guitar in 2005 and I never really took it seriously until 2011, when I dove straight in and became a solid guitarist within a year.

So now I would consider myself a good drummer and guitarist. I can also sing fairly decently. I've performed guitar/vocals at camp fires with groups of 15+ people. I played a live drum solo at my 70-person NYE party this year and people were going nuts over it. But I've never been in a band because I haven't met the right people.

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1389921260.0,"&gt;If you claim the original deal is SOOOO good

I'm going to guess you don't understand nuance. The original deal wasn't the ""SOOOO good"" but it was good enough for your GM to agree to it. The deal that happened was **not** ""SOOOO"" much better that the original trade was rejected for ""basketball reasons."" Why would Stern reject it? Because he has shitheads like [Dan Gilbert bothering] (http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7336526/nba-critique-dan-gilbert-letter) him basically about the Lakers getting too good of a deal. Of course, this doesn't make sense: **management on New Orleans' side agreed with the deal!** He doesn't care about New Orleans, none of the owners gave a shit about whether or not New Orleans got a better deal. Gilbert simply thought the Lakers got too good of a deal, and so he insisted that the league do something about it. This is illogical because New Orleans should be worried about getting the best deal for themselves, not stopping the Lakers from getting a good deal.

(Of course, Gilbert was merely the loudest of the complainers.)

&gt;Personally, I was glad the deal got rejected. NO would have still been a shitty team with aging players and no real direction.


Who the fuck cares what /u/bimmercire thinks? To add to this, who the fuck cares what /u/justgivingsomeadvice thinks? Seriously, no one gives a shit about any of our armchair general managing. I point to the Pau trade as an example of a trade where the league called foul, and 3 years later we find out that Memphis had a plan and did well for themselves (even if the Lakers became a championship team as a side result). My argument has always been, if the GM has a plan then you should fucking let him do it. If you're the owner, sure veto it if you think it's a bad deal, but if you're David Stern then you have too many competing interests to be able to make an unbiased executive decision on the matter.

So why is it that you fail to understand this?

datacat,socialskills,1389921279.0,"&gt;The average person can just learn by watching.

I get how it looks like this is the case but it's not entirely accurate. There's a lot of work that needs to be done to form the kind of complex rule system that lets people get along. Many people are still learning (ey, my parents are getting into their 60s now and the way they act sometimes makes me cringe). There exist in the world many people who are clingy or obnoxious or whatever and are not in control of their passions the way our society demands. It's hard and everyone needs to keep figuring it out as they go along. Some people do it faster and more intuitively than others but everyone does it on some level.

As I see it, there are three methods of developing a set of rules for socialising: Imitation, iteration, and deduction. Apparently, your daughter has access to a very limited set of people to imitate and a limited set of opportunities to iterate (trying things out and seeing if they give a good result). That leaves deduction which is basically Data's approach (I love Data so much, Star Trek even more). I don't think he's doomed. In fact, his rational mind is probably the most powerful tool for forming a personality in a short period. The course of TNG is basically his childhood and he messes up a lot but he gets there in the end (as seen in the last episode or in the films). He uses logic and some imagination to deliberately build up rules for himself to follow.

Actually, watching Star Trek was really helpful to me when I was younger. It helped me to develop a sort of social vocabulary which I could use in real life. Obviously, it's not exactly the same but it gave me something to think about."

day_kid_older_sister,relationship_advice,1389921286.0,"I'll answer both here:

We've been through this song and dance at least 7 times. I was so stupid to not break up with him the first or second times. It's a source of shame for me.

It was never just CL though. There were always other women on his FB or phone or popping into his life. I'm a horrible person that snoops when I'm suspicious. That character flaw doesn't excuse his, or that he would hide, lie, and gaslight me on the subject. Eventually he'd admit I was right, that it was just like porn (what a whopper of a lie!), that he'd never do it again, and we'd be good for weeks. The promise was enough the first two times, but pretty soon I could repeat his bullshit promise to him.

Eventually, I stopped being as devastated by it; it's hard to be so upset when you're half-heartedly expecting it. I'd be pissed, I'd cry, but I was getting numb to it. At one point, I even tried to compromise by saying he could surf CL as long as he did it on the public computer rather than his phone, and that he left his email logged in so I could see that he wasn't emailing anyone. This wasn't terribly effective, because he'd delete the emails as soon as they exchanged numbers and he'd gaslight me every time I actually caught him.

At one point, I even said he could have a side-chick, as long as he stuck to certain boundaries. Clearly, this is the land of DENIAL and I was an idiot. Just note that--on the off-chance that your girlfriend is dumb enough to get to this point (dear god don't let her)--she's probably at the end of her rope. I know I was. I knew we couldn't stand another round. Eventually I told him that I couldn't do this. I need monogamy.

And yet here we are: he's answered ads lately, in addition to FB exes and random chicks from the area. We're still technically together, but I don't think I can ever get past it. He's a liar; he's not trustworthy. It's warping me, my sense of trust and acceptable boundaries, and worst of all, it's causing me to lose interest in serious, monogamous relationships. After this disastrous cohabitation, I don't think I want to get close to anyone like this ever again.

**TL;DR:** we've been through this ~7 times. First there were promises, then supervised surfing in the name of transparency (along with the promise to not contact), a brief attempt at ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"", but this last time is too much. I can't trust him. I love him dearly, but this isn't a loving, respectful, or secure relationship. I realize now that I can't fix him, nor can I wait for him to fix himself.

goosrick,truegaming,1389921429.0,"Don't forget that we're still very early into the lifecycle of the ps4. It makes sense for ps4 games to have ps3 counterparts as not to alienate people who haven't bought ps4's yet. Developers are also not yet able to use the PS4's hardware to it's fullest potential. Go look at some early PS2 titles, they look pretty bad compared to titles that came out later in it's life cycle.

The ps4 seems to be 'just a graphical upgrade' because those are the easiest to make and also easy to notice. Making good AI is pretty hard, but I'm sure people will come along to do just that. Ground zeroes trailers have shown enemies flanking Snake while under the protection of covering fire from their teammates, or retreating to better positions, so the AI actually seems pretty good.

But I have to say: the game being on both PS3 and PS4 does irk me a little. I hope that the PS3 version doesn't drag down the PS4 version. I'd rather have the PS3 version be inferior by a wide margin, than have the PS4 version not live up to it's full potential just to trim down the difference between the two versions.

Also, the game running on Vita you saw was probably done via remote play (game is played on the ps4 but is streamed to your Vita). "

Also, fuck outdated, offensive, ""crazy"" feminists.

Or ManBoobz, that points out that a movement that thinks that women who falsely accuse men of rape should be punished as if they committed murder shouldn't falsely accuse people of rape and call it activism. And then point out in the comments how offensive TERFs are.

I want to know -- where, other than extremely obscure sites and blogs nobody gives a shit about other than /r/TumblrInAction and the *downvoted* eugenics threads in /r/feminisms or whatever -- does ""crazy"" feminism live. Like, not just a little wrong, but downright offensively crazy. And everyone likes it. And by ""everyone"" I mean enough people that I should give a shit. Because it seems that these so-called ""crazy feminist"" sites are full of people who actually denounce crazy feminists.

And holy fucking tags, Batman. That entire thread is full of them. As soon as I read ""dogma"" and individual accounts of women the people in the comments totally knew (but can't tell us why those individual women are accurate representations of feminism or what one person has to do with a worldwide phenomenon) behaving badly, I knew the whole thing was shit-tier, top to bottom.

You can literally predict what shit they're going to bring up. Warren Farrell and the fire alarm (to which NOW exclaimed ""A+ protesting, my young misandrists!"").

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1389921463.0,"Of course there is a place for you in the world, and nothing you said in your post sounds like you're doomed to end up alone.

I do want to say though, and someone else already mentioned this, but I want to chime in and agree that feminism can't really be blamed for the modern, dual-income household. We are living in a crappy economy, and I have a feeling there would be way more stay-at-home wives (and husbands!) if it were financially possible. Feminism hasn't kept wages low for middle and lower class workers. 

I also don't understand your reasoning for attending university so that you can get a job and make money (out of necessity, not because you want to) when you said in another comment that you don't intend to get a full-time job with your education, that you do intend to marry and stay at home. It sounds to me, and correct me if I'm wrong, that what you're saying is that because of feminism, you're not *already* married, as it is no longer as acceptable/as expected for women to marry young and forgo higher education. Thanks to feminism, women aren't expected to go straight from their parent's home to their husband's, they're allowed to do whatever they want. They *can* get married right away, but if they don't they're no longer labeled as social failures/old maids or impoverished if their families aren't willing/able to support them. Even if we lived in the 1950s, society wouldn't just *give* you a husband as soon as you come of age, unless we get into the territory of arranged marriages and I can't imagine that's something that would appeal to you or most women I've ever met."

I'm a trans woman, and I dress (if I had to put it on a gendered spectrum, which I abhor) just to the feminine side of neutral. As in, I don't wear dresses and flowers and pink shit. It's just not me. There is this pressure, though, to look and act in a more feminine manner. It's like society wants me to prove my femininity. Well, I'm a woman and everything I do is, by definition, feminine. No one can invalidate who I am based on bullshit gender roles. No one can invalidate who your friend is, either, based on those roles.

However, I am full-time and out to everyone I know. I do dress and act in an obviously not-masculine manner. I have a female name, I wear makeup, I have boobs, and I pass most of the time in public (I think). I have faced serious struggles in doing this. I have lost friends, been dismissed, mocked, ridiculed, and harassed to no end, etc. I really dislike someone using my identity, which I have to fight for, without suffering any of the hardships.

They had one flavor - Mystery Flavor. 

It was packed when the lines were switching over from one flavor to another, and therefore was always packed in smaller quantities, making it kind of rare. 

It was a brilliant way to use what would have been waste (or low quality product) in many creameries. People loved that Mystery flavor, even though it changed month to month. "

&gt; The six things I could never do without
&gt; -Great cinema.

Any exemple of a recent movie, adding to what you like.

&gt; -Humour.

Exemples ?

&gt; -Positivity.

Hmm, sounds like depressed. Better say optimistic.


&gt; The most private thing I’m willing to admit
&gt; I sometimes listen to Taylor Swift.
Damn! Here goes the joke. I take back what i said about ""humour"".


I'd say it's a good profile, maybe precise what kinds of common things you would like a man who you'll want to be in relationship with through your interests (like 90% of people I've seen read/watch Game of Thrones, it doesnt really help), so maybe precise what kind of stuff you like. It won't prevent from the douchebags to come and try, but to me I think having something to discuss to is the first thing I will need to message someone.

Honestly to perform at the NBA level you really need to be near perfect physically, the pressure on your joints playing basketball is so great you really can't afford to have a serious problem like that. I was shocked when Portland took him #1, I even showed a video of his running to my mother in law who is an occupational therapist and she said ""he is going to have some serious joint issues.""

Slukaj,videos,1389921907.0,"&gt; In some countries like Sweden or the UK (sources can be found in other comments) they have a policy to shoot to incapacitate.

And that's only realistic when you're not in a close-quarters scenario. Out on the street at 15+ meters, sure, shooting to incapacitate is absolutely possible. 

But you've got to remember: US police are trained to aim for the largest target on the human body, the center of mass. This is done because handguns are not easy to aim in high stress situations, and the center of mass (torso) is the easiest target to hit. 

Add on top of that a *very* confined space, and you've got no realistic option other than shoot for the biggest thing you can hit. 

Now, why didn't the officer back off? Because the guy was (based on the officer's speech and the anxiety in the woman's voice) suicidal, and the officers primary goal was to *help* him, not kill him. 

* If the officer lowered his weapon and the guy attacked, the officer is dead.
* If the officer attempted to disarm the guy, he could've been stabbed in the altercation and died.
* If he backed off, the guy could retreat back into his house and killed himself.

If you *ever* find yourself in a situation like the guy with the knife, the only scenario where you walk away alive is by following police instructions. "

red_one2012,AskMen,1389921976.0,"What you should be considering is how much you can afford for rent. You typically should not spend more than 30% of your take home pay. 

I don't know if you're moving into your boyfriends place where the rent is already a specific amount, or if you are trying to find a new place and therefore can choose something that you can both afford. 

If scenario 2 is the case and you personally can afford to pay $500/month rent, then your budget for a new place can be a $1,000/month rental. This would keep everything equal between you &amp; your boyfriend. Anything above this total either can't be an option for you or you will have to discuss as a couple whether he can pay the additional amount or if you can pay less for other shared expenses. 

If Scenario 1 is the case (boyfriend already lives in a place where 50% of the established rent is out of your budget) you will also have to discuss with him and say that you can't afford 50% based on your income level. 

Hope everything works out for you :)"

ScipiiRye,TumblrInAction,1389922010.0,"That is an entirely valid concern regarding circumcision, and is, in my opinion, the only valid complaint anti-circumcision proponents have. It is true and a legitimate concern that this potentially life-altering procedure is done without the consent of the child. That's for the ethical boards to debate, though, not enough to outright 

My beef is that they insist on defining it as ""mutilation"" despite their consistent inability to provide evidence that it is a practice regarded as mutilation in academic circles. That's a direct appeal to emotion in order to vilify the practice so as to make themselves appear in the right by arguing from a moral high ground.

I don't give a hoot if you're against circumcision, but at least base your arguments against it on legitimate concerns, not ""but it's mutilations!1!!11"". Inevitably they stop arguing because they know darn well that male circumcision is not defined as mutilation, they're just unwilling to admit that their own revulsion is what drives their arguments, and as we know on TiA, feels make poor bases for arguments.

As you can see throughout the comment thread, definitions for ""mutilation"" have been thrown around, but not a single one for circumcision that explicitly defines it as such. As I've said, that's because the practice is not the same as FGM, and legitimate institutions, the CDC among them, do not recognize it as such.

Male and female genitals are physiologically different, it stands to reason that respective circumcision is physiologically different as well. (Though to be clear I am against FGM in all forms, as is any sane individual.)

I'm curious, though, you've mentioned you're Australian; is there a similar popular reaction towards circumcision there? I'm wondering if the knee-jerk opposition to male circumcision is an exclusively American phenomenon. It's widely practiced in Canada, where I live, and I've never come across anyone who reacted to the fact that my family (myself included) is circumcised as strongly as Americans on reddit seem to. Though, to be fair, I haven't talked to all that many people about it; it is my penis, after all."

mfranko88,xbox360,1389922258.0,"Short answer: yes I have tried this and it does work.

Longer answer:

1. This is a point of semantics, but in the tech world there is a difference between memory and hard drive space. Memory is like RAM and has nothing to do with your flash drives.
2. I have several USB flash drives that I use for various games and DLC: two 32GB and two 16GB. Both are from Sandisk. I'm 99% sure that you can use any size USB device (as long as it's at least a certain amount of MB, probably 128MB). For any device with a capacity over 32GB, the xbox will only ""set aside"" 32 GB of space on that hard drive. Even if you plug in a TB drive, only 32GB of it will be used. 
3. I am not confident about this being a universal thing or if my XBox is just old/stupid, but my XBox will only ever recognize two USB sticks at a time. I tried to plug in three and the third one that I plugged in never showed up/was recognized. This might be circumvented through a USB hub; I don't know. So if you are going to use more than two USB sticks, figure out a way to organize them all. Have games and DLC ""bundled"" together. Don't have game ABC on one flash drive, DLC 1 on drive 2, and DLC 2 on drive 3. Otherwise you will not be able to access it all."

lots of ugly girls aren't interested in short men but it's not like they are interested in her either so it comes off as more self delusional than anything when they talk about dating levels quote unquote."

The problem, though, is that this cop's first goal was to help the suicidal knife wielder. While it was dangerous of him to enter the apartment without knowing what to expect, his objective was to help. If the guy killed himself with his knife, then he would've failed his objective.

So the best course of action he saw was to enter the house and hope to god that the guy wasn't homicidal. "

I think the level that gets me the most is the Four Ways of Mystery cave level early in Defender of the Future. I don't have claustrophobia in real life, but damn does that level scare the shit out of me. Near total isolation, very easy to get lost in the winding passages, a real risk of suffocating due to rare places having air, lots of things that can damage you in tight passageways, and an instant kill giant eel guarding the exit. To this day I remember the feeling of dread I had every time I had to leave one of the few alcoves that had surface air in that level. I feel all the Ecco games alongside the obscure game Treasures of the Deep are some of the scariest psychological horror games I've ever played due to their intense isolation and atmospheric elements."

Rakan-Han,AskReddit,1389922587.0,"I recently experienced this.

Tiny backstory. I'm a 21 year old dude, but I'm already a Godparent. Since I was a little kid, I was constantly beat up by my father for my 'own good'. During these times, I learned that I inherited my father's anger outburst, meaning I explode and WILL hurt people when I get seriously angry. So I learned to control it, to make my patience incredibly long and to slowly defuse my anger until there's practically nothing left of it. This has saved me the trouble of being sent to jail for the past 10 years. 

Long story short, I have to take care of my 8-year-old Godchild, let's name him Jaden, for a weekend.

I was sleeping when Jaden came and tried to wake me up. Now I'm not a morning person, so I sleepily nudged him off, saying I want to sleep. But... He just kept coming back. I know it wasn't his fault, but his constant nudging and whining was ticking me off. Then he mentioned something offensive, even though he said it in a joking way:

""You're stupid""

The next thing I knew, my sleepiness was replaced with boiling anger. Anger that I thought I have defused during the last 10 years. I didn't realize I've actually only bottled it all up inside. And everything just exploded.

I flew off the bed, grabbed him by the neck and shoved him into the bed.

""You little piece of shit, didn't I tell you to not bother me when I was sleeping!?"" I screamed. This isn't probably the best time to tell you guys that I've also inherited my father's booming voice. Like those of a Drill sergeant, I have a built-in megaphone in my lungs.

Anyway, as fast as my anger appeared, it quickly disappeared... Or maybe because of 10 years of controlling it, I've been able to defuse it that quickly. I can't believe I exploded on my own Godchild. The one that treated me like his best friend whenever he's around. 

I can't forget that moment, where he just looked up at me with his eyes, shocked and scared, and me clutching on his neck like I'm about to choke the little life out of him...

That was a year ago. His parent's found out, brother-in-law silently exploded on me, sister went ballistic, my parents jokingly mocking me (through the years, dad has learned to be incredibly chill with everything now. He only gets angry when we do incredibly stupid stuff), siblings bring it up time to time as a joke about I'm the hulk IRL.

I never want to experience that again, so I'm always defusing every little anger I experience right now, to the point that I only get angry when someone hurts a person very, very close to me... 

But I know that it MIGHT happen again someday, and I'm afraid of what would happen if I'm unable to control it then...."

&gt;[""One of the most heavily advertised features of the Xbox One is its ability to integrate live TV feed from your set-top box, be it terrestrial (Freeview HD), satellite (Freesat or Sky) or cable (Virgin Media) broadcast. However, since receiving their consoles yesterday, a number of British owners have complained about the TV integration feature being broken, due to the introduction of judder with 50Hz content... The problem is that the native frame rate of the Xbox One is 60Hz, but the United Kingdom and Europe use a 50hz broadcasting system, which is the result of the historical use of PAL and SECAM analogue broadcasting systems. To display a 50Hz video signal on a 60Hz system, a process called frame rate conversion (FRC) needs to take place, which at the best of times will incur some judder. Depending on the implementation and also the original resolution (720p or 1080i), viewers may notice dropped/skipped frames or stutter especially during panning shots in fast-action sports material such as live football broadcast.""](http://www.hdtvtest.co.uk/news/xbox-50hz-201311233468.htm)&lt;


That would seem to differ. At least with the Xbox you can get a workaround and eventually a software update since it's a global product with an internet connection. I doubt that a European cable/satellite box will even come with ability to do 50&gt;60hz FRC and the same goes for a US made version that will do 60&gt;50hz, it's just not a feature I would expect to find on a regional product."

redwhiskeredbubul,TheBluePill,1389923033.0,"&gt;If I'm recalling correctly myself, USSR had the highest casualties in WW2 and about a quarter of the Soviet men were killed. Some age groups had up to 80% of the men wiped out.
 
To be clear, I was not discussing the mortality rates of military units. I was discussing mortality rates as a proportion of the _entire population of the country._ Average Soviet military losses as reported officially were just about 25%, which is extraordinarily high. Also, the 25% figure is the _lower bound_ for what wikipedia gives. 

But taking the upper bound for military losses plus non-combatant deaths including famine and disease divided by 2 (I'm not doing genius-level statistics here) gives just about 21 million men out of a male population of 84 million, which is...you do the math, but I think that is about twenty-five percent, but that is an upper bound figure (it is less than ten percent with the lower figures, which includes the official military casualty rate) and likely too high given that the homefront would have been disproportionately women . Applying the same math to female casualties, you get about eight percent. On the one hand, that is a very large difference. On the other hand, that's still in the ballpark of nine million women who died. And most deaths in the Soviet Union were of combatants. That was not true in other places. 

Bear in mind, for example, that war deaths killed a _quarter of the entire population_ in Belarus. About three quarters of these deaths were of civilians.

Thus the myth. When you are discussing WWII, the most extraordinary fact is the number of civilian casualties, which were suffered very disproportinately by area. If you look at Japan, for example, the country was utterly devestated: 90% of all Japanese cities were firebombed and some were entirely razed. Two cities were also destroyed by nuclear bombs. Yet Japan was in the middle as far as the level of destruction was concerned: casualties were far higher in China, where war also continued for another four years after WWII ended and had begun in the early 1930's. China also suffered very high civilian casualties through all of this. 

This kind of destruction targeted women as well, sometimes specifically. Japan used rape somewhat systematically as a means of terrorizing civilian populations. So did the USSR in invading Germany. I'll just pull from wikpedia again here, because I'm lazy: 

&gt;A wave of rapes and sexual violence occurred in Central Europe in 1944–45, as the Western Allies and the Red Army fought their way into the Third Reich.[1] On the territory of the Nazi Germany, it began on 21 October 1944 when troops of the Red Army crossed the bridge over the Angerapp creek (marking the border) and committed the Nemmersdorf massacre before they were beaten back a few hours later.

&gt;The majority of the assaults were committed in the Soviet occupation zone; estimates of the numbers of German women raped by Soviet soldiers range from the tens of thousands to 2 million.[2][3][4][5][6] In many cases women were the victims of repeated rapes, some as many as 60 to 70 times.[7] At least 100,000 women are believed to have been raped in Berlin, based on surging abortion rates in the following months and contemporary hospital reports,[4] with an estimated 10,000 women dying in the aftermath.[8] Female deaths in connection with the rapes in Germany, overall, are estimated at 240,000.[9][10] Antony Beevor describes it as the ""greatest phenomenon of mass rape in history"", and has concluded that at least 1.4 million women were raped in East Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia alone.[11]

&gt;Natalya Gesse claimed that Russian soldiers raped German females from eight to eighty years old. Russian women were not spared either.[12][13][14] In contrast, Russian war veteran Vsevolod Olimpiev recalled, ""The Soviet soldiers' relations with the German population where it had stayed may be called indifferent and neutral. Nobody, at least from our Regiment, harassed or touched them. Moreover, when we came across an obviously starving German family with kids we would share our food with them with no unnecessary words.""[15]

&gt;After the summer of 1945, Soviet soldiers caught raping civilians were usually punished to some degree, ranging from arrest to execution.[16] The rapes continued, however, until the winter of 1947–48, when Soviet occupation authorities finally confined Soviet troops to strictly guarded posts and camps,[17] completely separating them from the residential population in the Soviet zone of Germany.

So clearly, women are targeted in war also. It is just discussed in a different manner. 

None of this is to say that 'male disposability' isn't a  real thing. And men do die in greater numbers in war. But women die also, so I think this issue has to be discussed in view of an informed discussion of the total picture. "

when the 360 and ps3 first came out, and blu ray players and hddvd players were out, every single one of my friends went with the PS3 because bluray. you buy a PS3, you get bluray.

you buy a 360, you have to buy an extra box to plug in so you can watch HD movies. you might as well buy a separate HD-DVD player, or buy a 360 and a separate blu-ray player, beacuse all your friends have PS3 and have blu-ray movies you can borrow.

halfwaythere88,AdviceAnimals,1389923214.0,"Possibly. My kid is 4, so I don't have a lot of knowledge about that yet. With my kid, I have to keep the lessons simple. If I said ""If you keep leaving your toys out, I will take them away"" and then I don't, basically all she learns is that I don't mean what I say. I'm sure you could do this once or twice and back out, and your kid would most likely still respect you, as long as it was very rare. I don't think it would ""ruin"" them if you backed out once or twice, but trust me when I say, if you give a kid an inch, they will try to take a mile, so it might be harder to lock it down later, but if you continue to always follow through after that, then eventually it will be fine. 

Now with teenagers who have the ability to understand an overly-harsh and rash judgement? Sure, that might be ok as long as you have a good kid and have already created a very strong foundation of respect. If you try and cinch down on a 14 year old who has never seen you follow through with a threat though, it's going to be WAY harder. I guess it might depend on the nature of the child, their previous history with parents, and how often you back down. If my parents ever over-reacted and ""took it back"" with my brother, he would have still respected them and been an amazing and polite kid. If they had done it with me, I would have made them pay.

There is no universally agreed ""whole point"" to these games, so I completely understand if some people just don't want to breed their own Pokemon and would rather buy them. Kind of like the same way people go out and buy a whole cake (or any other food, or go to a restaurant, or etc). Some may think ""the whole point of having cake is to MAKE the cake and then enjoy the fruits of your labor."" while others just don't have the patience/talent for baking/cooking and will gladly pay a seasoned baker to make them the cake. The baker gets some moolah for their hard work, and the customer gets their little finished product to enjoy. Everyone's happy except for the onlookers who judge them.

ERP is basically a process of desensitization. You're holding your own feet to the fire, so yes you should expect your anxiety to increase. The idea is to do so at a manageable level: enough that it's effective but not so much that you're overwhelmed.

You said you've been going to a therapist for 2-3 months, but how long have you been trying self CBT/ERP? This stuff takes *time*, so don't be discouraged even if it has been that long. It's been about 4 months for me and I feel like I've only now turned the ""corner"" in that it's easier to continue than to quit.

Here's a technique I found very useful: *I intentionally subject myself to triggers*. Instead of waiting for a compulsion to appear, I intentionally touch something ""dirty"" and then force myself to wait some interval before washing. The key is that this puts me in control of the situation. I started it and I'll end it. When I say.

Then, when life throws a trigger at you, it's easier to assume control. You didn't trigger the OCD intentionally but it's easier to step into ""control mode"" in your mind and handle the situation.

Hope that makes sense. Good luck, keep up the good fight."

The process is as follows:

1) determine where the grant money is

2) Write grant proposals.  A lot of them (protip - copypasta large sections from prior proposals, using as many of your field's buzzwords as you can).

3) if you actually get approved, scramble to develop a detailed protocol.  I used to do research with human subjects - this means getting protocols approved by the institutional review board(IRB), biosafety committee, radiation safety committee, etc.etc

4) carry out your protocol.  Note:  everything will go wrong.  You'll be understaffed, have difficulty with subject recruitment (and probably attrition), equipment will malfunction and break, samples will be lost, and you'll be overbudget (medical and research supplies are expensive).

5) Salvage what you can after your protocol is complete.  Pray you didn't miss any vital data points.  Write your manuscript...  this involves a lot of creative writing to make it sound liie you accomplished something.  Publish with anyone that will take your work.

6) throw it in your CV and use your work to apply for more grants to fund even greater fuck ups.

ETA:  I'll add that there is a really good chance your work will not yield any usable results.  That said, some of our projects have uncovered unexpected, and very promising, findings.  None of the papers I've authored have really been noteworthy, though:(

wordserious,technology,1389923995.0,"As someone who manages IT in a university: this happens every semester. The students focus on usability and connectivity, lately as it relates to mobiles. They end up making a product that is extremely useful and that students love. But then, here is a list off the top of my head that students don't tend to focus on:

- security

- compliance with state/federal and local regulation

- documentation

- support

- maintenance

- integration

- scalability

- uptime

Frankly, it pains me to have to shoot down some of these projects. At my uni we try to be supportive of such initiatives and we work with students who want to work with us on projects like this. But because they don't pay attention to that list (and other things that escape me now), if we kept these resources up we would be liable when they get abused/hacked, we would be guilty of negligence when the sites fail to implement law and regulatory requirements. When students graduate and move on, we would inherit systems that have no documentation and are impossible to maintain. When the systems that those sites draw information from change, the site would break and someone would have to rewrite it. When the community starts depending on something like this, we find out that what works well for 1000 students in the CS dept crumbles to dust when you allow 25000 people to access it .

The list goes on. Believe me, I do think that unis have the duty and the opportunity of using students to maintain our resources, as it is real world experience that they can use. But it is very hard to make that work in a professional, accountable manner. In short: if I fuck up, I get fired. If a student fucks up, it was just a learning experience.

TL;DR: I wish unis could to this more but it is not as easy as it seems."

Samipearl19,mentalhealth,1389924042.0,"I have bipolar 2, and one of my best friends is borderline, so I'll try to highlight the differences between the 2. 

Bipolar 2: I always know I'm having an episode when my thoughts move too fast for me to keep up with them. I get terrible insomnia with ridiculous inspiration at the same time. In one instance I slept about 9 total hours over 2 weeks on which I painted almost 20 paintings. I get incredibly impulsive and brash. This is most noticeable when I find myself having to dominate the conversation and often thinking how stupid or easily manipulable other ppl are. 

Borderline: the biggest issue here is the interpersonal attachment. When someone hurts you or you think you're losing them you absolutely hate them. If you have the smallest inclination toward someone, you love them and could never love without them. It's soooo all or nothing with no middle road at all. My friend truly believes she's in love with every guy she gets a crush on. Then at the first sign of their not returning her feelings, it's the end of the world. 

One of the easiest differences tho is the suicidality. With bipolar 2, you're much more likely to feel suicidal because you're a failure and attempt it impulsively. You won't talk about it. You won't even plan it. It'll just occur to you and you'll try it. With borderline, it gets threatened a lot. You'll talk about doing it a lot and use that as a way to get people to stay with you or love you or not leave you. But I have never known a borderline person to genuinely attempt it. They plan out how to do it without *actually* doing it. As long as it looks like it, they get the result they want. "

As for other stuff, if I've eaten anything glutinous (wife is the GF person in the house) within the past couple hours, we don't kiss unless I brush &amp; rinse thoroughly. If we go out for dinner, I'll often opt for a GF meal as well just to keep things simple."

2) When the game ends, the player with the highest life total wins the game. 

The impact of these changes is, I think, really nice. It keeps players from being eliminated early in the game, as every other player will attempt to keep a player in danger of death from dying. It also inspires some nice interaction as players attempt to keep each other alive until they're in a position to strike. 

The only caveat is that the win condition seem to favor Oloro, but when the other players keep him in check, it's not a problem. It also helps that Oloro lacks a ton of burst damage.

Seriously, have you been around the NFL for long? The Colts were a dumpster fire until we got Manning. The Texans, who you seem to think tanked this year, weren't very good for a long time until a couple years ago. The 49ers were awful until Harbaugh showed up.

However, guys are just as freaking bad. Maybe we notice it more from other women because we ARE women, so when we see someone being a bitch or an attention seeker or a drama llama, we think 'great, way to reinforce a stereotype'. But when I think back to all the drama I've seen roll out in MMOs, I think it's pretty even. Most of it comes down to the fact that sometimes people are dicks and like to play games, act out fantasies they can't achieve in real life (in a bad way, not the normal healthy gaming way) and take things out on other people.

I get hit on more if I am out and about. For example when I used to ride the bus and worked as a cashier I probably got hit on by strangers around 3 times per work day on average. When I was in college I would almost always get hit on on a night out to parties or bars. Now that I am in grad school and drive everywhere I get hit on a lot less often. I rarely get hit on in the form of a text or message out of the blue, it is usually in person. 

I definitely get hit on more often than I get explicitly asked out. Unless asking me out is his opening line, I will have probably expressed my disinterest before the conversation gets to the point of asking me out. 

Along those lines, there are times that it seems like maybe a guy is interested but isn't being explicit about it (if I'm right, plausible deniability or nervousness I suppose, otherwise I just misread). In those cases I would just make a point to not be flirtatious or mention my boyfriend (or I'm single, say something else) and then those dudes who may have otherwise hit on me or asked me out will decide not to.

To answer your question directly: no, evidence of parasites (eggs and segments and whatnot) will not simply evaporate after four days. The test is valid.

And you know it's OCD anyway.

The real turning point will be realizing that no test will ever be good enough for OCD. There's always uncertainty, thus always a place for OCD to stow away."

I always solve that by assuming the Westerosi length of a year is just different from ours. Jon might start the story as a 14-year old if you count in Westerosi years, but if you would count the actual seconds since his birth and translate that to years as we know it, then you could perhaps end up with 19 units.

LucasSatie,NoStupidQuestions,1389925042.0,"Shaving cream has a few functions. First, it moisturizes the skin. Second, it lubricates the skin. Third (in some cases), it can actually stimulate the skin to raise the hairs thus making them easier to cut.

Yes, you can shave without shaving cream. Some people just do it dry while others may do it in the shower (the water will act as the lubricant). Doing so dry may be painful or cause more cuts if the skin is particularly dehydrated or tender. Though, the more often you shave dry the better of a tolerance you build.

Regardless, I would still recommend applying a small amount of lotion to the shaved area."

JesusHipsterChrist,Cooking,1389925054.0,"INGREDIENTS:

Pork Belly (You can use a different meat, I won't judge you)
Garam Masala
Jalepeno Juice
Light oil to toss ingredients with
Fresh cilantro, minced finely
Uncooked Pie crust
Egg Wash (egg and water...it's magic)
A devil may care attitude

I apologize for the lack of specific amounts. Personally, I generally eyeball everything and season to taste, and it works for me, so I don't have exact amounts for you. You'll find a mix that you like, and if all else fails, there are plenty of vindaloo recipes you can use as a jumping off point. Just remember you are going for the spice combinations and flavor, not the sauce. Otherwise, it would be too wet to use inside a proper pie (though that would make a mean shepherds pie, we'll keep that in mind.)


THE FILLING:

I started with a mix of onion, potato, pork belly, and tomato. I threw it all in a Zip Lock bag and tossed in Some Garam Masala, a bit extra cinnamon(because I like it), and jalapeno juice with a little bit of oil, and tossed it an coated the shit out of it. 

I then transferred everything to baking sheet and place in a single layer (or in my case a pizza pan, since it fit everything quite nicely in one layer) I roasted everything at 350 degrees for about an hour then checked it every few minutes til it was done. 

The vegetables should be cooked through, the potatoes being the imporatant ones to check. The Pork belly will take a definite color(as seen in the picture) and will be slightly chewy, which makes for fantastic texture in the pie. 


MAKING THE PIE:

I then used just plain old packaged pie crust from my local grocery store. I let it get to room temp, rolled it out, then put the filling in. At this point, I also added fresh cilantro (and a bit more jalapeno juice, it a still not quite spicy enough for my taste) folded the the crust over, and then brushed an egg wash on it so it would look extra pretty. I then baked it according to the pie crust instructions and ka-blam, meat pie. 

SERVING:

fiat_lux_,TheBluePill,1389925066.0,"&gt; To be clear, I was not discussing the mortality rates of military units. I was discussing mortality rates as a proportion of the entire population of the country. Average Soviet military losses were just about 25%, which is extraordinarily high. Also, the 25% figure is the lower bound for what wikipedia gives. Taking the upper bound for military losses plus non-combatant deaths including famine and disease divided by 2 (I'm not doing genius-level statistics here) gives just about 21 million men out of a male population of 84 million, which is...you do the math, but I think that is about twenty-five percent, but that is an upper bound figure.

Each of those ratios you gave is a quarter like I said. The lowerbound military estimate as well as the upperbound total estimate (but you notably divided the upperbound by 2 anyway).

So basically, we don't have any disagreements here.

&gt; Thus the myth. 

I see. It was a misunderstanding. So your point was that *""the ratio isn't that bad""* in your opinion, not that *""men dying in wars is a myth""*. At least that's debatable.

&gt; So clearly, women are targeted in war also. It is just discussed in a different manner.

&gt; None of this is to say that 'male disposability' isn't a real thing. But I think it has to be discussed in view of an informed discussion of the total picture.

Sure, women are also victims of war, in different ways. Things clearly become much more complex when *""discussed in view of an informed discussion of the total picture"".*

But the OP isn't doing that. OP is trivializing male disposability, which goes beyond war (like I said, vagrancy, suicides, occupational hazards, etc). You would not tolerate it if the OP trivialized comfort women or rape in general. *""The numbers weren't that bad. Others have had it worse. Some people just whine too much.""* That would obviously sound obnoxious."

DragonFireKai,magicTCG,1389925112.0,"Your deck is a little schizophrenic. The bestows, ethereal armors, and wingsteed riders suggest that you're thinking of a heroic voltron deck. But the spears and evangels are traditional white weenie.

 For a traditional style white weenie, you don't want a lot of auras, you want global enchantments and quick cheap creatures, the only heroic creature that plays into that archetype is the phalanx leader. If you wanted to go that route, you should drop the alseids, the ethereal armors, and the wingsteed riders, and replace them with brave the elements, rootborn defenses, and one drop white rushers like soldier of the pantheon, boros elite, and dryad militant. For removal you can run with banisher priests. The idea behind the deck is to overwhelm the opponent with loads of creatures.

For a heroic based deck, is recommend keeping the bestows, and replacing the evangels with favored hoplites, and the spears with ordeals of heliod. The idea behind a voltron deck is to build a single creature up to huge levels, and protect it until it wins. It's a different approach, and it values cards differently. I run a heroic aggro deck in my standard FNMs, and it does well, and costs about $11 to build."
HopkinGreenFrog,relationship_advice,1389925112.0,"I'm going to disagree with the general consensus of this thread and say that your feelings are a bad sign that you probably shouldn't move in together. My reasons:

* You are trying to give him an ""out"" by saying ""I would be happy if he just wanted to find roommates for himself and not to feel pressured to move in with me.""
* You say ""sometimes I could see myself marrying him."" It sounds like you aren't really feeling it.

Moving in definitely elevates your relationship to the next level, so I agree with other posters that it would be a 'test' of your relationship, but it also puts a LOT more pressure on to STAY in a relationship. Breaking up while living together, especially with a shared lease or mortgage, is a lot harder, and people who are only kind of unhappy tend to just swallow it down and linger on. To quote the Barenaked Ladies, because why not, ""I could leave but I'll just stay; All my stuff's here anyway.""

If he were to say ""hey, I actually decided I wanted to live with &lt;friend&gt; as a roommate for a year, is that cool?"" would you feel sadness or relief? Try some thought experiments on yourself if different outcomes happened and listen carefully for your real, instinctual reactions. I hope you figure out what's best for you."

ernestborgnine2013,PlusSize,1389925141.0,"On a related note, I recommend trying some sulfate-free shampoo. They are not hard to find. There are a few different brands that I buy - one is Organix. It's available here in Canada in most drug stores, if not all. When you use suflates on your hair, it strips out all the product you use on your hair and any bacteria that might have made a home on your head, plus any natural oils. The natural oil are what makes hair look healthy and manageable. Because of this, I now alternate between suflate and non-sulfate shampoo, to get the best of both worlds. 

The reason I mention this is that my friend started using head and shoulders on a regular basis and her hair became dull and dry. She doesn't see it but I definitely noticed the change. As soon as I opened your pic, the way your hair lies at then ends reminds me of hers. I think you could try a sulfate free shampoo.

By the way, the main difference between shampoo for colour treated hair and regular shampoo is sulfates. They take out the sulfates for colour treated hair products because it fades the colour faster.

Anyway, it took me many years to get that sulfate-free shampoos made my hair less frizzy and more manageable, as well as makes any hair dyes I use last longer. I thought you might appreciate the tip.

On the topic of hair cuts, I don't have a lot of experience with recommending styles. Everyone has different hair. 

What I will say though is that your hair colour could use some different but subtle highlights. If you dye it yourself, I would stop doing that unless you can figure out a way to add your own highlights. What highlights do is add depth to the hair. They also make hair look more healthy because different shades of colour give the illusion of light and shadow, which we associate with shiny hair. I got my hair dresser to put really gentle highlights that are still going strong 1 year later. She made the highlights more intense at the ends so that it gives the illusion of hair naturally lightened by the sun. Because she put most of the highlights at the ends, there was no stage where I appeared to have roots. That was the only way I could afford to do it.

Anyway, just some tips from a 40 yr old (who looks a lot younger). I find I am not that concerned with the style anymore as long as my hair is regularly trimmed, has dimensions through highlighting, and is being maintained with the right shampoos.

Sorry for the long post - you remind me of a young me. I had a similar hair colour and glasses for most of my mid-20s.

LucasSatie,NoStupidQuestions,1389925392.0,"This isn't necessarily true. Lag is a very broad term here. When it comes to gaming there are three types of lag: internet lag from the server, internet lag from your connection and machine lag. You are correct in the sending/receiving aspect but it can happen on both your end *and* the server's end.

Machine lag is simply when your machine isn't able to display everything that's happening.

Lag can sometimes work in your favor, it really depends. There are even ""lag hacks"" for certain games where essentially a player is able to stutter the connection to the server in such a way where their hit box isn't where their character model is but their hits still register.

However, that is cheating and **will** get you banned.

Many games attempt to compensate for this with varying technical terms or programming jargon but it's near impossible to truly balance lag.

Edit: I forgot to answer OP's question...

Lag is very unbalanced. As Yiin describes, it's all about lost information and no two people are going to have the same amount of lost information. If a game has no lag-balancing features then the person with the least amount of latency (i.e. the fastest connection) and the least amount of machine lag will have the largest advantage because their information will get to the server faster than the other person's. However, nearly every game out there has some form of lag-balance and thus the issues you see mostly now are due to problems or flaws in the code."

Truly **pure** water should have a uniform taste but unfortunately the filtering method will almost always leave a flavor in the water. Even distilling can leave some impurities and even the method of containing the water can impart a flavor.

Simple Guiding Mission: **""You must aim to carve out a Kingdom of your own, in a place you should not be.""** So no Kingdoms in Scandinavia, avoid Rus or England at first. Once the Kingdom is born, abandon your old Scandinavian holdings to a dynasty member and go nuts in your new homeland.

**Reccommended Start:**

[The Petty King of Vestergautland.](http://i.imgur.com/IilLaI8.jpg) This unfortunate sod is perhaps ranked 4th in the great game of nation building in Scandinavia, with a large pool of (average martial + Marshal training) 1200 men and a reasonable supply of 14 boats to ferry them, along with a modest 27.5 tax income capital. A few small expansion options in de jure vassal Alfheimr and neighbouring county Vermaland are available to boost levy count, before you inevitably rub up against the [big boys](http://i.imgur.com/Tdp14Lv.png) [in the sandpit](http://i.imgur.com/1qODcLS.png). Outclassed by the rising powers of af Munso, Kyntling and Yngling, and with no kingdom title waiting for him, this bloke hasn't got a chance. But perhaps if they searched abroad...?

Not too easy a start, not too slow a start. Gives people options, only a single impending doom to pay attention to, and allows us the hope that we won't have to wait till the 8th round to arrive at our new home."

And I know in a make up sub reddit it's taboo to say this, but I think that an important part of doing your look is not *over* doing it - and so here it goes:    

   
The blending of the pinks in your eye shadow are *expertly* done, and match perfectly withe the lip! beautiful. But the foundation looks a bit *heavy* - not necessarily the wrong color, but it seems to be adding texture to your skin that would otherwise be much smoother  - the color seems too painted, and is covering your natural undertones and blush. The liquid eyeliner similarly looks a bit too heavy. Maybe try thinner lines that focus more on the outer corner? That will work more to accentuate your lashline instead of drawing it on.    
You may want to try a more natural shade of shadow around your inner corners as well - there's a lovely shape of your lashes on the outside but the pink distracts me a bit. Maybe an iridescent nude?"

You can buy the far end of the spectrum, a good old war bow, and be reminded just how powerful these weapons are every time you loose an arrow. The bow will be everything you need to get the job done, but it will demand that you be flawless or it will break you.

Recurves and better selfbows are kinda the middle ground, especially with the best mollegabets being able to outcast most recurves at equal weight, putting you and your bow in equal demand of each other for top performance, so to say.

That being said, even good selfbows and recurves, being less impressive in cast compared to compounds in every case, can take any North American animal at fifty pounds of draw and good arrow placement. You really don't need a stronger compound unless you're looking for a challenge, but the best way to challenge yourself is to go down the technology line."

But in this instance, OP isn't ""in a wheelchair"" (to borrow your comparison.) OP is worried that he will one day be in a wheelchair, and my suggestion was that if he was that concerned about it (seeing as how ending up in a wheelchair is something that is entirely outside of his control) he put his self worth into something that won't be irreparably damaged if he turns out to need to be in a wheelchair.

It is much different to tell someone who has already stopped growing to not worry about how much they grew (or didn't grow) in the past, because it is already a certainty. They are already facing the challenges and discrimination. However, the future is not as certain, and even the best estimates of final height by doctors can miss the mark, sometimes drastically.

LucasSatie,NoStupidQuestions,1389926664.0,"It's completely different based on the person, the case, the doctor, the insurance company, the time, etc...

Essentially, the doctor will tell you ""you need this operation"". 

The next step is that they contact your insurance and say ""he needs this operation"", this step may take a few days. 

Next your insurance will either say ""no, prove it"" or ""why"" and their response may take a few days. 

So, the insurance company makes the doctor fill out paperwork and send in documents making the doctor prove that you need said operation; this may take a few days. 

Once the insurance company receives all paperwork they will either grudgingly say ""okay, do it"" or ""no, we need more proof""; either way this takes a few days. 

If they require more proof, they'll send more paperwork for the doctor. 

Once approved, the doctor then has to figure out his schedule (i.e., will he be on vacation? Do you require a different doctor to do the operation?); this step may take a few days.

Then, as long as all of this happens accordingly, they call you and schedule your appointment date.

The biggest problem here is that sometimes things get lost, or backlogged or forgotten. You really should be calling your insurance company every few days for status updates. This ensures that they are actively working on your case plus it lets you know where in the absurdly long process you stand. A lot of times they tell you ""we're waiting on your doctor"" and so you call your doctor and they say ""we filled out the paperwork and sent it in two days ago"" and then you have to call your insurance people back and tell them so and then they have to go looking for your paperwork or declare it lost and make the doctor fill it out again.

Yes, I have had to deal with this more times than anyone ever should. Yes, it is always frustrating. No, it never gets better. No, I'm not exaggerating any of this."
itsachickenwingthing,AskMen,1389926665.0,"I play multiple instruments. I started with guitar in my teens, playing around with my brother's guitar for a while. I got my first guitar for my 15th birthday and still keep it to this day. My favorite instrument is still the drums, though. Because I was on the drumline in high school, I'm mostly wired to emphasize percussion in the music that I play. I've also dabbled in bass and keyboards.

I've been writing music for about as long as I've been playing it. Back in the day I used to spend hours faffing around on Guitar Pro, to the point that I wrote multiple albums of music. It's mostly really heavy rock and metal, with a bit of soft stuff here and there. The first band I tried out was mostly just me tagging along with my brother and his friends, but the stuff they were doing was way to technical and heavy for where I was. The second band I was in was with two music nerds, a guitarist and a drummer, that I got me into the jazz/blues side of things, but I basically picked up bass to be in the band and just couldn't keep up. At around the same time I had started to try recording music, but my hard drive crashed right around the time I had just got the hang of it and so I still haven't recorded any complete songs yet.

Since I started college, space has been kind of limited so I can't really have the setup I used to. Naturally, I haven't been on a drum set in ages and I only keep one of my guitars with me nowadays, though I have picked up beatboxing just because it's convenient. Most of my output has come from FL Studio, which required me to completely change my style and learn the ins and outs of electronic music (which again expanded my horizons); [shameless plug to my soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/coreyomara). Unfortunately I've been in the dumps lately and the muse is just gone. Once I get my own apartment I'd like to get a setup going again and start having ""recording days"" again."

I went to JCP, Ross, and Macy's which are all in the Military Circle mall and JCP had the best layout. Lots of space between racks, clear signage, easily navigated so that you could see all of their merchandise. Ross was OK but I was jut there for cheap gym shorts. Macy's was atrocious. I could barely tell where I was going and was extremely overwhelmed. 

At any rate, I got three dressy shirts, Nike sweatpants (which accounted for $32 of the bill), and a thermal for $98. Two dressy shirts alone could easily rack up over that price at even somewhere like Nordstrom Rack, which is unfortunately too far away for me to travel to reasonably, though I love their Seven Diamond shirts."

lamblikeawolf,short,1389926803.0,"Sorry. I re-read my original comment. It wasn't clear that I was saying the ""entitled"" matched with the term ""friend zone"" and people that bandy that word about. Not with the being nice and being rejected, or that short men think someone is entitled to date them. I was trying to say that in my experience, people that have used the term ""friend zone"" tend to have a sense of entitlement to a female because they were nice. Which is hugely different from what /u/funtimeshotwomen said, ""Either be friends, date her, or politely move on."" I find that the individuals that do those things do not describe their interaction with said female as her having put him in the friend zone.

I don't disagree with you about the differences of being nice and being rejected vs. having a lot in common and then getting rejected.

I don't disagree with you that the person that is rejected a lot in that fashion has every right to be frustrated by it. However, they don't have the right to feel like they were entitled to date that woman, and that solely by rejecting him, she is a shallow individual who actually only cares about money and looks."

Scarcer,microgrowery,1389926824.0,"Personally it sounds like you are using too many additives. (rooting, teas, aqua shield, molasses etc.) I think that G/H Go Box is a bit of a gimmick. It's only complicating the situation.

Keep the C/M for the R/O water, but cut down everything else until you have a working base formula around your primary growing nutrient figured out and everything under control because if your soil is good, and your feeding your base nutrient correctly you shouldn't be having deficiencies in theory. This will also make it easier to manage your pH.

Hydro nutes work just the same in soil, but I recommend using something pH balanced that doesn't require nutrient additives to work properly.

**Don't use pH adjusters, they are bad &amp; you shouldn't have to in the first place.**

I'm huge advocate of G/H Flora Nova series, try it out, and get it right one whole grow/flower cycle before you start adding a bunch of random stuff.

Less Serious Side Note:

Now I'm not sure which Roots Organic soil you are using; (should be two different kinds), *&amp; I'm positive others have had a different experience than me, but my plants didn't grow quite as well with Roots Organic when I tried it a few years ago; though the soil I was using was mostly uncut. Yours looks well aged and cut nicely so that may not be the problem.* **If you run out of options** after trying all the advice people are giving you here, you may try using Happy Frog as it's an excellent base soil."

Also one of the flange studs broke and the other two were half-rusted way and stuck in the manifold. The hex bit was too eaten up to turn them out. The flange surface is perfect, however.

Should I go ahead and wire brush it with a bigger drill? Get it resurfaced and punch out the old studs or just buy new manifolds at this point?  "

This is my stream of consciousness, be warned, this will most likely be a incoherent rant about nothing at all. There will most likely be lots of grammar errors due to be thinking faster than I can type 

More and more recently I've been thinking in ways that others fear(?). Every time they say ""How do you expect people to think of that"" or something along those lines, this would be fine if it was some vast conspiracy, but it never is, it's just so obvious yet no one sees it. It confuses be how they CAN'T see it, it's as plain as day. 
What is ""it"" you may ask? ""it"" is the meaning behind things, the extra bits everyone leaves out because they're scared to say it or something, I don't know.


Do you want an example? OK.
A man sees his friends being nice to each other, so he jokingly calls out ""Hah, gay!"".
What is your first reaction? I'm sure most people's first reaction would be something like this: ""Wow, just because they're nice doesn't mean they're gay, and even if they are, what's wrong with that?""
That nice and all, but my first reaction is something like this: ""I get it, they're being nice so the friend is comparing them to the stereotype of gays. Wait, if the gay stereotype is being nice and courteous, then why do people find it to be insulting? Wouldn't that mean calling someone 'gay' mean that you're calling them a nice and courteous person? Well, considering what is offensive and what isn't is subjective, I guess it's okay to not like being called gay. But even the.......""

Imagine that but 3 or for times over with a healthy heaping of tangents mixed in for flavor, all of that is related with that two word sentence. This seems pretty ok by itself, but what tops it off it what I like to call ""layers"".
Imagine a computer, the first layer is what you are doing, like browsing the internet, watching porn, etc, etc, etc. The first layer always does what you say. The second layer is the processing of the watching porn, the third layer is the processing of the OS, repeat ad nauseum.
Each ""layer"" has it's own mental ""loudness"". Now I'm not saying that I hear voices or anything like that, I'm saying that I hear my own thoughts echoed to the point of incoherency.

I could go on and on about how I have nearly no emotions, how I'm overly logical..yet not, or a wide selection of reasons that I think I'm insane, but for now, I say goodbye, seeing as this comment is already very long.

My simple advice is to make sure you eat a good breakfast, lunch and dinner, at least 500 calories each ( 500 cals is easy!).

That's 1500 calories right? Now make a simple, easily drinkable shake to drink after your workout. I promise you it will just taste like chocolate milk. Check it.

* 2 cups of whole milk (320 calories)
* 1 scoop of protein powder (140 calories)
* Half a cup of minute oats, powdered ( 150 cals)

Now you have an easy to drink, 620 calorie shake! It also has about 46 grams of protein as well. Now you're at 2120 calories! Personally, I need about 2700 to gain weight. Fill that 600 calorie gap with snacks. Here's an example

* Small bottle of drinkable yoghurt ( 80 cals)
* Pudding cup (110 cals)
* Granola bar (140 cals)
* Cup of milk ( 160 cals)
* Nutella on toast (200 cals)

500 calorie meals are really easy, but making up the rest of your calories might be difficult, but you just have to stick through it. It's not really that hard, the hard part is doing it every single day, but soon you'll get used to it, and you'll begin eating it easily, might even be eating more! Don't forget to exercise, otherwise all these (relatively) healthy calories are just going to make you fat!"

Generalizations aside, the problem with this is that he is saying X behaviour by women leads to Y behaviour by men. He's saying men only become controlling because they feel insecure in the relationship because of something the woman has done.

That is excusing the behavior or, rather, shifting the responsibility to the woman.

Controlling behaviour is the responsibility **only** of the person doing it.

I'm reasonably fluent (B2/C1) without much of a noticeable foreign accent and I just about never speak English with Swedes. But when you first start learning, you'll probably need to say specifically that you'd prefer speaking Swedish because most people will switch to English, to make the conversation flow more smoothly. That said, I think Swedes actually overestimate their English skills quite a bit. Most young people are pretty comfortable understanding and writing but it tends to be a matter of them hearing and reading plenty of English but rarely speaking it a whole lot (if they live in Sweden). Anyone who studies a foreign language should know that despite a high level of passive understanding, you can get pretty rusty if it's been a while since you've spoken it."

Third, suicide isn't the logical solution. Also, there is absolutely no evidence that supports any dogma, so don't rely on reincarnation.

Fourth, numbers are just numbers. Don't die over numbers.

Fifth, with your work ethic, you probably won't have a problem holding down a job once you graduate. You also don't have to pay off your student loans until sixth months after you are no longer in school. (Technically it's seven months, though you'll learn about that later).

Sixth, if all else fails, there's probably some supportive person or people in your life that you can fall back on.

Seventh, don't give up on doing more than just getting by. Explore your hobbies and interests. You may surprise yourself.

Eighth, I hope you have a good night and upcoming semester. The route to success in life isn't pure happiness. Life is full of ups and downs but what makes life worthwhile is that every second, you are experiencing something you hadn't experienced before.

MrSky,AskReddit,1389927498.0,"You can Google ""All Lucky 7s"" and it'll come up. Since it was Final Fantasy VII, they made it so if any character's HP was exactly 7,777 they would go nuts during battle, attacking 63 times in rapid succession, giving the enemies no chance for rebuttal and doing 7,777 damage with every hit. It's practically unstoppable but very annoying to try and get that exact HP count. 

It's been a while, but in that video (I think) they've got Barrett at just under that HP, have the other two characters down (common starting technique for Ruby Weapon so he'll become vulnerable quickly) and then have Barrett do an Omnislash that has multiple weakish attacks. Once Ruby Weapon goes vulnerable (sticks his arms in the ground), Barrett is healed up to all 7s (player must have worked the math out beforehand, I think people usually use Potions), causing Barrett to freak out and repeat his previous multiple hit Omnislash over and over due to special materia. So each of the 63 attacks does *multiple* attacks all at 7,777, and the nature of the Easter egg means Ruby Weapon never gets a chance to counter. If you work it out, Barrett can do millions of damage, which is higher than any max HP anything in the game could possibly have."

Like /u/joanna70 said, the cup fitting well and the band being too tight combined with your measurements probably means that some of your breast tissue is under the band and not in the cup, therefore causing both the band to feel tight and the cups to seem like they fit well. You can test this by trying the bra on backwards. The band should feel fine if what I said is the case. In addition, did you scoop and swoop when you tried on the bras? If you scoop and swoop and the cups are too small, you will find that your breast tissue will overflow.

As far as trying a 30C after a 32B, they are sister sizes. A 32B has the same cup size as a 30C, just the band is longer. A 32B is for a woman with a larger underbust while a 30C would be for a woman with a smaller underbust, however, their actual bust measurement is the same. By trying a 30C after a 32B, you will exacerbate the problem of the band being too tight because the cup is the same size, but the band is even shorter. 

If you would prefer physically going to Nordstrom again instead of trying bras on at home via their online store, I don't recommend that you get fitted. Instead, look for bras that are in a 30D or DD and try them on yourself.

We can also help you pinpoint your exact size if you can post the five measurements as seen in this [this visual fitting guide](http://i.imgur.com/lAWWlll.png) that's in the sidebar."

I am a relationship therapist and I have also seen a counsellor with my partner.

Just wanted to say that counselling only really works when both people are willing to go and want the relationship to work. Counselling wont 'fix' a person who doesnt want to be 'fixed' - it wont force a person to communicate about the relationship.

Also, it is important to find the right counsellor that works for both parties. 

You may find the reason that the person doesnt want to communicate is that they dont feel fully safe talking about things? Or maybe they are happy with the way things are (even if they are not working for you, maybe things are working for them?). Maybe they are not interested in things changing? If any of these things are the case then maybe a counsellor isnt what you need?

Either way I hope things work out for the best.

Consider this: http://bionmr.unl.edu/wiki/Mapping_HSQC_Chemical_Shift_Changes_To_Protein_Structures

The image on that page is a model of a protein. Every tiny texture bump on that model represents at least one atom, probably a small cluster or ""side group."" These bonds between groups bend and flex and reconfigure themselves so that all the atoms in the protein are as close together as possible without being so close that they piss eachother off. (Yes, this is a horrid, unforgivable oversimplification.) It's an immensely complex structure, and you may have heard online that a lot of brainpower has been poured into figuring out how a protein bends to make its best shape--something that's not usually obvious considering the large number of atoms, and hence charges, involved.

Even DNA is just one protein, one molecule. If you were to print out the super-simplified version of one molecule of one person's DNA, in the G/C/T/A form, you'd get pages and pages of printed paper, more than enough to fill a roomful of file cabinets stuffed with DNA printout. And remember that each letter in that sequence represents a side group of 12 atoms or more, and that each has its ""opposite"" on the other side of the DNA ladder, and that the ""rungs"" of said ladder have to be held together by *something*...

...and that *every single sperm cell has a DNA molecule like that*...

...in addition to all the other proteins it has to make its parts do what it needs to do...

Yeah. That's a hell of a lot to try to quantify.

Not that it's not possible! But, like, grab a Snickers."

Your firm works for the government, or a municipality, and is designing a park to be paid for with tax money.

However, industry standards dictate certain things need to be in imperial. Fencing protection around trees, waterline depths etc. 

Also, all lumber, gravel, grass seed, concrete, is all quoted in imperial. 

What pisses me off the most is when they request items in a metric quantity. Which I then need to convert to our industry standard. Then on the bid form it asks for it to be in metric, so I convert back again.

2. [The strikers are angry about changes to their pensions, increased workloads and government plans to bring in performance-related pay](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24268852)

dementeddr,AskReddit,1389928020.0,"First of all, astronomers have already found hundreds of planets inside their stars' habitable zones, with sizes and densities comparable to that of Earth's. According to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet) Wikipedia article ""Around 1 in 5 Sun-like stars have an 'Earth-sized' planet in the habitable zone"".

As far as I know of, there have been no exoplanets found with an abundance of water or an Earth-like atmosphere. If an exoplanet was found to have oxygen in the atmosphere, it would be a massive discovery. Oxygen has a tendency to bond with lots of things, and so it doesn't build up in the atmosphere on its own. If a planet had atmospheric oxygen, it would mean there was life on the planet producing the gas faster than it could be absorbed."

Pachacamac,AskAnthropology,1389928203.0,"Ok, my time to shine. And one of my comps questions was on this and I haven't revisited it in two years (will need to update it as I get to that part of my actual dissertation, but that's a project for a few months' time), so I'm a bit rusty.

Regarding contemporary theories, my perspective is that the *why* of state formation was really popular from the 1970s through the early 1990s but nothing even resembling a consensus was ever reached. Since that time, anthropological archaeologists have focused a lot more on describing early states and their variation, determining how we can identify states in the archaeological record, and arguing that the state is meaningless and that we can't really define what an early state is anyway. So there aren't a whole lot of contemporary hypotheses that really try to understand why states form, or what exactly led to them.

Enter my perspective. I'll caution that no, this is not a published reference yet, but it will be (if nothing else it will be in my dissertation). From my perspective, the key thing is *not* the state itself, but rather the development of social hierarchy, or permanent leadership. This means that chiefdoms and states are essentially the same form of government, with states just being a more complex chiefdom. This is handy too because states only developed independently six times (and spread from there), whereas chiefdoms developed independently all over the world. 

As for the most popular anthropological hypothesis on what led to the development of states, they all contain an element competition, which led to control. Essentially independent communities compete (mostly for material resources, but some anthropologists would argue that they compete for prestige), and when one gains the upper hand, they have an element of control, and this leads to power and the state. 

This has taken me a while to write and I have tons more that I can say, but I need to get stuff done for tomorrow, so I'm just going to leave this here for now. I will get back to this! Probably on Sunday.

In the meantime, here are some good (relatively) contemporary books that deal with early states and that give an overview of the different theories, and some sort of formulate their own. These are all good books to go to. If anyone knows of any recent (since 2010) books or articles on early states, please let me know about them! I've set states aside in the last couple years but I need to return to them.

Dajbman22,AskMen,1389928211.0,"You will never avoid the occasional comparison, it's only natural. The key is to keep your focus as much in the present as you can, and not dwell on those comparisons. When they do come up, try your best to keep them light, and if possible laugh about them. This keeps anything pointlessly negative from ruining a good thing you eventually have going.

For me, a big issue was that I had just gotten out of a very intense year and a half long relationship that ended more due to situational issues than us not being ""right"" for each other. In, fact in her break-up speech to me, my ex said I should start hanging out with my now-fiancee as she thought the two of us would make a good couple, and  she wanted me to be happy with somebody else.

As you can tell my issues stem mainly from an intense ex being very similar to the next GF (and even in ways I would never have guessed until well into the relationship). Now, years later, we joke about those similarities... and diferences, but if I had dwelled on them too long, things could have easily been torn apart. Each time I felt I was focusing too much on a comparative view, I just focused on the here and now, and too account of everything that was going amazing for me. 

Years later, that ex (who was my first serious GF) is a much less ""real"" and tangible memory, but to be honest, she will always be a part of who I am. We grew together at a very influential and volatile stage of our lives. We all carry baggage with us. The key is recognizing the baggage and realizing it must be kept at bay.

lamblikeawolf,short,1389928342.0,"&gt;He's already in a wheelchair and he's hoping to get out of it.

I guess I missed this part. Especially given that in OP's original post he said

&gt;I know im not really short right now and probably wont be really short later 

And in other places in the thread, he said:

&gt;yeah, i'd actually be fine with being 5'6.

Those things lead me to believe he's not actually freaking out over his height.

On the other hand, I don't know what the ""average"" height of a 14 year old is supposed to be. I don't know what it's like to be 5'3"" at any age, or if that is average, or short, or tall for a male that is 14 or 15. 

I do know that between 6th and 10th grade (11 - 16 years of age) boys often grow at ridiculously different rates, to where friends who had been similar heights before end up being radically different heights for a while, and then end up closer. Because the effects of puberty kick in differently for different people.

I do know that OP said he was a ""late bloomer"" as well, which also tells me that his present height right now is likely highly variable, which is, in turn, backed by his statement

&gt;I've grown from 4'10 to 5'3 in 8 months.

I could compare his height over the year to the [CDC chart](http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/data/set1clinical/cj41c021.pdf) but that's really unhelpful considering I only have two data points and the volatility of his height in recent days. On top of the fact that his height of 4'10"" when he turned 14 is below the line on the chart, while his current height of 5'3"" at 14 3/4 years old puts him just under the 25th percentile, but if he grows another 2.5"" (ie, continues his current rate of growth for the next 4 months) that he ends up smack in the 50th percentile for height.

**TL;DR below:**

&gt;You're telling him to stop worrying and pretend like the wheelchair doesn't put him at an enormous disadvantage throughout his whole life.

Considering the fact that he is not currently worrying about his current height (as evidenced above), I am suggesting he not start worrying, and not to put his eggs in a basket that has the potential to fly off a cliff. That way, if that basket does, in fact, fly off a cliff, he has some eggs he has already invested elsewhere that he can use, rather than having to start over with new eggs."

huisme,Archery,1389928404.0,"Arrows are spined at length x for draw weight y. If you draw consistently to the same length, and thus the same weight, the arrow can be spined to that weight at whatever length. If you start drawing shorter or longer you'll change the weight behind the arrow and the spine will be off. If you shorten the arrow after it is spined it will be too stiff, and if you put more weight on the tip it will be too soft.

Tl;dr: yes, part of the point of consistent draw is to be sure you don't overdraw short-as-possible arrows and shoot your hand, but it's also part of consistent shooting and proper spine."

RexRexRawr,AskReddit,1389928413.0,"Like most bartenders I think that bartending school is a giant waste of money. Bartending school teaches you the very bare basics of the job, all of which you could easily learn through some reading and maybe a few video tutorials. Most bars/restaurants don't care if you have gone to school to be a bartender because they know that the logistics of the job can only be learned by actually doing the job in an actual bar setting. Your best bet is to apply/take a job as a barback where you can learn by watching and through being eased into the position of a bartender. Other helpful things to getting your foot in the door is getting T.I.P.S certified, and take the bar smarts course which provides a much more indepth knowledge of cocktails, spirits, wine and beer."

My credit was so tanked I couldn't even open a checking account at some banks, and they gave me a chance. Beyond that, they call &amp; send me a bday card, always serve hot coffee and occasionally cake, and the manager once gave me &amp; my daughter a ride home when we were stranded in the rain. I can make a withdrawal immediately after making a deposit. They also have a deal where I can withdraw from select other bank's ATMs fee-free, so I can access my cash free no matter where I am."

Everyone is going to have their own ideal of what is pretty, so while you might not be doing it as a result of someone else objectifying you, by breaking down your body into parts, then nitpicking those parts, its boarderline self-objectification.

But its your body, you are allowed to objectify it and break it down as long as it makes you feel good. If you are unhappy when you do this, then its important to be aware that you are doing it and that you can stop.

Anyone considering surgury needs to reflect on what it is they want to gain. When I had my labiaplasty, I wanted to gain the ability to wear pants, to have sex without tearing something, To wear pads without chaffing and to use a tampon without getting lost in my own genitals. I wanted to gain symmetry for ease of diagnoses, and I wanted to remove a cyst that was painful and a constant cause of anxiety over cancer. I gained most of these things, and while sexual function played a huge role, sexual appearance didn't. My breast however are another story, while one of the drivers is their flat shape that makes finding a fitting bra difficult, another driver is the feeling that I am not feminine enough because they are not the shape we come to expect of breasts due to the media only showing a few shapes of breast. Because I can clearly identify this reason as being about pleasing others and self-objectifying, I ignore this reason when contemplating the surgery."

ronearc,food,1389928789.0,"She deemed my efforts to clear the smell to be throughly acceptable. :)

I seasoned the steak with salt and garlic powder. I cooked it in a hot-as-holy-fuck cast iron skillet to which I added a couple of tablespoons of peanut oil right before the steak went into the skillet. I then flipped the steak every 20 seconds until it was almost done. At that point, I added a couple of tablespoons of salted butter and flipped the steak in that for another minute. 

The finished steak went off to a plate where I covered it with foil. 

I then dumped mushrooms into the skillet, stirred those around until they started losing their moisture, at which point I added another tablespoon of butter, a diced shallot, and two cloves of minced garlic. I stirred that around until the shallot was softening. I then added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. 

Stirred that around some, poured in about a cup of red wine, killed the heat, and stirred occasionally for the next few minutes while the sauce reduced. 

For the Brussels sprouts, I split them in half, toss them with olive oil, kosher salt, and black pepper. They went into the oven (edit: at 400F) for a little over 30 minutes. I stirred them every 10 minutes or so. 

Plate and enjoy. 

The wine was a surprise - a bit too light for this meal, but it was a 2011 Little Black Dress Pinot Noir. Light and fruity and honestly quite pleasant - over powered by the steak though. Next time I'll have it with salmon or something. "

The distance and cost to get there is great but so are the possible scientific discoveries.

Try get a job you enjoy. And that doesn't mean the work has to be your dream job, it can mean that the work environment is fun and the people working there are good people. You'll make friends with your co workers easily.

You should sign up for classes. Language classes, writing classes, cooking classes, art class. You'll meet interesting people that have a mutual interests. And maybe join a gym, for the same reason.

Move in to an apartment with multiple room mates. It's impossible not to meet people through your room mates. Some of my best friends these days are people i met through a guy i used to live with. 

It's important to know that getting more active isn't the be all, end all of making friends. You have to open to meeting new people and be willing to ask people to hang out, but dont be pushy.

When I was in college, my wife (then-gf) and I shared a studio apartment for a semester.  One day, we're getting it on, and close the blinds so we can get down to it.  We're just getting into strap-on sex, and I go into the kitchen to put it on, since the strap-on dance is supremely unsexy (I've since gotten over this particular embarrassment).  So I'm wiggling it on when I decide to look up for some reason... and the fucking window is open!  And guess what?  There's these two dudes sitting across the way at their dining table in their window, eating their lunch and just casually watching me (I think, they could've been looking elsewhere... but I sure thought it was at me).  I freak the fuck out and waddle into the bedroom, completely naked with this strapped dildo around my knees and explain what just happened, mortified.  Completely killed the mood, and my gf cackled as she closed the blinds in the kitchen.

keyo_,newzealand,1389929493.0,"&gt; Legitimate new car dealers lose business to shady used cars importers

This is bollocks. The reason dealers miss out is because the monopoly distributors see NZ as a captive market and jack up the prices. The Japanese imports are the only thing keeping this in check. For people who absolutely must have the latest fancy car (brands like Mercedes) it's much cheaper to buy in overseas.

&gt; It's unsafe. This policy has left NZ with one of the oldest fleets in the developed world

So what? We also have the most frequent safety checks in the world. If the car is older than 6 years (I think) it must be checked for a WOF every 6 months. Even a 14 year old Japanese car has Airbags, ABS and crumple zones.

&gt; You can't do this in Australia 

Have you seen the car prices in Australia. It's ridiculously expensive over there for used cars. But you want that right? You want *used* cars to be unaffordable and keep their resale value. This is only good for the wealthy who can afford new or nearly new cars.

You can also blame the likes of Subaru offering discounts to lawyers.

&gt; The National Government's policy in this area harms businesses

What businesses? Mechanics and dealers are doing well from it. Blame the importers of new cars.

&gt; putting you in danger as one could collide with you and your family

It's the driver who causes this, not the car. I would much rather be hit by a Honda Accord than some big new SUV.

&gt; Sometimes stricter regulation is needed for the good of the public.

Protectionism is *bad* for most of us. All it would do is make new cars even more expensive because the exclusive importers can charge what they like.


If you don't like driving an old peasant car then why don't you just move to Australia.

I do think the 1-star ANCAP rated cars should be banned or have higher yearly registration costs. This is the only point I can agree on.

I started up in school because it was something to do, and found out that I had a natural talent for it. Sophomore year of high school, I bought my first bass guitar, and picked up my first electric guitar two years later, so I've been playing for 5.5 and 3.5 years, respectively. I've not had a traditional lesson in that entire time.

I predominantly play more progressive strains of metal, but can get by in almost every genre when playing bass. I have a solo project that I do almost everything for, but otherwise, I'm a gun-for-hire. I currently play guitar in two bands (with an audition for joining another band coming up shortly), but have played bass in four different projects at different times, which are all now in varying degrees of hiatus. I also have plans for a multitude of other projects, spanning genres from gothic thrash/doom metal to psychedelic jazz to post-punk/New Wave, which are waiting for the opportunity and the musicians to show themselves."

Unless it is specifically stated that the surgery is at no cost to the patient and this only happens when the cost is covered by a third party (say, a charity) or if the hospital absorbs the cost to fix an error caused by their staff. 

There is no guarantee that a surgery will work or fix the problem. Sometimes a surgery can even make the problem worse. But, as long as the surgeon didn't make a mistake during the surgery you are still liable for its costs.

Now, it is possible to sue the doctor for malpractice to recoup costs if you believe the failure was caused due to doctor error; as in, if you think it was a failure because the doctor didn't properly stitch up your wound or left an instrument inside of you.

I guess I thought that men were more of wanderers (I mean it is their post-Elhnofey/pre-man term) and elves originated on Tamriel, but with what you're saying (if I understand correctly) is that both groups wandered basically just as much, maybe men a bit later after elves were mostly settled.

Lost and without a sign of reinforcements, the crew faced their doom with grim faces. The captain said a few words of encouragement and rallied the men.

""They won't take us down without a fight, right lads,"" he bellowed. Cheers and shouts were the response. The men, even the most brazen, were shaking in their boots. No sane man wanted to die, no matter how heroic.

The enemy approached in force. At least 3 men-of-war and 4 frigates. The ensuing battle was horrific. Chain shot ripped through masts and sailors plummeted to their watery graves below, never to be seen again. Round shot splintered the planks and split men in two. Yet under the waylay, the men held firm.

They never ceased their duties and never gave an inch. With the ship collapsing around them they pressed on. Fires were combated, guns were reloaded, the dead were removed, the wounded were patched up, the captain gave orders, and the lookout reported enemy positions. Hours passed and all this work was taking its toll on the crew. Hope was fading and morale was low, yet the lookout kept his post; he was not ready to quit and accept his fate.

As if an answer to prayers, the lookout yelled that there were ships on the horizon. The reinforcements had finally arrived. The crew, invigorated by the good news, pressed on. With new vigor, they furiously tried to save their crippled ship. Within minutes their ship was in flames and sinking rapidly, but the crew pressed on. Just a few more minutes.

""Ship off the port bow! It's friendly, Captain,"" boomed the lookout. They crew had made it. Men had been killed, wounded and maimed. Not a single man had come out unscathed but they had survived and were able to live to tell the tale of how they escaped the jaws of death."

We have a lot of great actors and actresses and they don't get anywhere in the mainstream. These awards shows were created by white people for white people. The only time we get an award is when we play roles they see us in. I am so tired of that. I haven't watched an award show live in awhile but now i just don't watch at all because i know there's no point to it. I want to see us having our own awards shows.

If you finished your packet of Minastrin, and its now placebo week, all you need to do is open up the genric at the end of placebo week and start taking the generic active pills instead of resuming Minastrin.

However, if you stopped taking Minastrin before the packet finished, how you start the Generic is up to you. You can wait for your period, then take an active pill corresponding to that day and be covered immediatly. Or you could get your period and take a generic placebo pill, wait 14 days, then be covered, but have a better chancve of avoiding any pms side effects.

Or you could just take a generic active pill today, and take 21 active pills from here on, then move onto placebo week. You may skip a period or get some spotting with this method. and it will take 7 days to give you coverage."

&gt; While it’s nice to be paid, we get our sense of “reward” from something else: public recognition, with our name in lights; status, such as a corner office; the boss telling us privately how much we improved; a client telling us that the code we wrote changed his life; better opportunities, such as the team’s “best” developer getting to go to a tech conference.

&gt; Is that about ego? Maybe. But “ego” might be shorthand for “We are primates.” We’re social creatures. We look for evaluation. It’s hard to tell whether we’re good at what we do. Most of us need to feel like we’re contributing something to the pack. We’re hard-wired to do what we can to ensure that the pack doesn’t push us off the cliff when small prey gets scarce in the cold months.

The caveat, of course, is that your employees have ""enough"" that they don't have to worry about money.  Of course people WANT more money but it's generally not a great motivator as long as you're not making so little that it distracts you from work."

Edit: To give an actual answer, environment is thought to have a fairly large impact on gene expression (epigenetics). Your genes do not determine as much about you as you seem to think. Genetic diversity is a VERY good thing to have, because environments change and what makes one individual superior in one situation (ex: genetic disease favism grants resistance to malaria) will make them inferior in another (some medicines and favism do not mix). Absolutely, *some* traits are better in *some* situations, but is it really that enormous a difference? And is it worth the kind of things social darwinists advocate? I certainly don't think so.

The tricky part is catching the bar and keeping your momentum, but missing the catch on this flip isn't going to hurt you any more than slipping off of the bar would for any other trick.

As for flipping around the low bar and back up to the high bar, you can see that the gymnast is conveniently proportioned so that the bar pretty much does all the work itself.  This is something that's sort of size-specific.  If the gymnast is too tall, it's probably in their best interest *not* to try this skill.

Years ago, I'd been listening to a lot of sets from underground electronic DJs.  I was listening to a Hard NRG set...  a subgenre that has a dark, gritty sound.

One of the tracks in this set had a sample mixed into it that made me stop the player with a quickness...  

I recognized the sample as audio of a murder of a small child - screaming for his mother.  The audio had surfaced maybe 10 years ago?  I remember clicking on a link at a forum, not expecting it to be as described.  Authentic or not, it made me feel dead inside.

malapropistic,femalefashionadvice,1389930482.0,"These are all the things I always want to say put into one post. Like I said in another thread, it's all about preference and budget and all of the other different things you aforementioned. Something that works for you may not work for someone else.

Clothes are meant to be worn and not hide away in your closet. Sure, they may look like a piece of art but you don't hang them on your walls. You hang them on yourself, you are the canvas, and you are what you want others to look at (and if not, that's also cool).

I think the word investment is ok to use as long as you mean that you are investing in yourself rather than the actual monetary value of the item. Investing in yourself means something different to everyone, to someone it could be buying a Burberry jacket and to someone else it could be splurging for something nice at Zara. You are the one ""investing"" in yourself so you call the shots. 

You are putting the time and effort in to make yourself look and feel good. I think that's what fashion is about in the end, even regarding price and quality. It doesn't matter where an item is from, if you like it and it looks good on you then your job is done (if you want these things to last though definitely take good care of them after wearing!)."

&gt;Following the Life publication, the Kirby family allowed the clothing company United Colors of Benetton to use the image in an 1992 advertising campaign, feeling that its story would reach a world wide audience. Fallout from the campaign came from many sources, including the Catholic Church which felt that the image was an inappropriate allusion to the historical imagery of The Virgin Mary comforting Jesus Christ after the crucifixion.
In 2012, Frare told Life that David's father Bill Kirby expressed the family's feelings on the use of the picture by Benetton when he told her ""Listen, Therese. Benetton didn’t use us, or exploit us. We used them. Because of them, your photo was seen all over the world, and that’s exactly what David wanted.""

You have to actively keep this capsule from destroying THIS copy of your mind at all times. 

You passively (or actively if you have enough time) let the mind poison do it's thing if sufficiently threatened. Note data transfers are slow, there would be time.

In your scenario they download a poisoned/useless version of your mind. There is nothing to torture.

People who are married with good sex lives are probably going to keep it to themselves.  There's a sort of confirmation bias going on.  As for the ones who do lose their sex lives, there could be a lot of different reasons: one partner (or both) had a low sex drive to begin with, pregnancy and breastfeeding can significantly lower libido (until both are over), other things one partner is upset about can leak into the bedroom (ie: one partner never helps clean anything, causing the other to feel resentful and less horny), people are tired from working and/or kids and don't feel like putting the effort in anymore, people fall out of love, etc.  But I genuinely think a lot more marriages have frequent sex than is generally believed."

bmartinmusic,Trombone,1389930938.0,"Couple things regarding intonation:

To be completely and utterly honest, if you were always in tune, you would not be 15th chair in an honor band festival.  Period.  This is coming from personal experience: you're probably at a point in your musical development where you feel like you're better than you actually are.  It wasn't until I went to college that I realized how truly mediocre a trombone player I actually was.  Spend time working with tuning drones.  Work on your tone and your breathing.

Furthermore, it's much more difficult to play in tune if you're by yourself with (or without) a piano accompaniment than if you're in an ensemble - especially a homogenous one.

Take your money that you would spend on a book and take one or two lessons from a teacher.  They'll be able to help you more than a book will.  If you want to succeed at trombone you have to want it enough to make the necessary sacrifices.  If you're not working, get a job and save up your own money for a lesson teacher.

Good luck, and I honestly don't mean to be a holier-than-thou jerk, but you sound an awful lot like me when I was your age, and I sincerely wish that somebody had told me these things then."

His position was that by being committed to each other without sex, sex won't become the foundation of a poor relationship. However, it is often a problem in such cases that people find themselves with mismatched libidos and interests (one wants sex three times a week, the other once a fortnight, one wants to be a bit kinky, the other is 100% vanilla) because they weren't exploring what they want sexually. Some of those people either get divorced, or just carry on, not content with their sex life.

He's a great guy (served in the army for 25 years, fought in Korea and Vietnam, self made millionaire, head of several government agencies) and at first sight he looks like a lovely 83 year old southern gentleman but as soon as my grandma (she's 89) brings up some current political issue you see his jolly southern smile turn into a deep frown.  He lets out a breath, his muscles (very big for an 83 year old) clench up and he almost whispers ""what the hell did you just say Betty?""  She sighs, takes a long drag on her cigarette and then tells my uncle what she thinks.  ""how in GOD's name could you think that Betty!?  What would mom say?""  Probably something racist, my great grandma was a great bookworm, cook and mentor, but all the same thought that blacks were sub human and trained her shitzu's to attack the black mailman.

endymion2300,AskReddit,1389931717.0,"depending on where you live, there may be some compromises between being off the grid society-wise and physically.

i live in a little industrial 'hood in a major california city. i'm fairly near-ish to conveniences like restaurants and stores and shit, but no one knows my neighborhood exists. i've got a few friends that live here and we just do whatever we want. like the house in fight club, but with more hugs and less of an agenda. 

a friend described my little slice of town as ""a tom waits narnia"".

everyone down here (i have maybe 20-ish neighbors) is a little societal reject. we're all decent people, and friendly with each other, but we all share a major disenchantment with the american dream. 

granted, my actual plan is to leave the country and homestead somewhere a little less american-y. i didn't feel that way before i stumbled across my current home, although i was already nonplussed with the general public. 

i'd recommend looking around for [cheaper and/or creative live/work spaces](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=vulcan&amp;find_loc=Fruitvale%2C+Oakland%2C+CA&amp;ns=1), or even places that are so out of the way that the owner doesn't care if you're living in the warehouse, or not. 

and if you live near the coast (in the us, at least), you can find lots of younger people living on boats in marinas. they're usually fairly friendly, although pretty far removed from normal society. 

there's also random communities out in the middle of nowhere, usa. take [slab city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_City) for example. pretty much anyone can park an rv and stay there. yeah, there's a lot of recreational drugs there, but everything and everyone is out in the open, so it's pretty safe and self-policing.

i know that most normal people react to statements like ""off the grid"", ""homesteading"" or ""[boondocking](http://boondocking.org)"" like you're some kind of extreme hippy or a gun nutty prepper, but the reality of it is a lot of almost completely normal people are doing what they can to be more and more self sufficient. 

and there's nothing wrong with that."

You wake up to your family slaughtered, with ""You let my crops die"" written in blood on the walls. Suddenly a noise rings out and you turn to look at what made it; one of your parents is still alive, barely clinging to life. You run up and kneel beside them, spitting out questions until they let out a single ""shh""

Another perfectly understandable reason (beyond religion) that one would abstain from sex (that no one seems to have mentioned) is if that person is asexual. Or one could just not be all that fussed. There are plenty of reasons people can have not to, but if someone doesn't have a reason, and is abstaining just out of inertia, that seems weird, and anxiety, social skills, or just bad luck could be a factor.

I agree with that, It also gives us a chance to see whether his nerve damage is really serious. We need to be sure he'll be fit for us, so another 6 months recovery is a good idea.

papermageling,Judaism,1389932015.0,"This is nonsense. 

I went to a secular all-girls school from 3rd grade through 12th and had very little contact with guys until college. Yes, I probably interacted more with guys than your average Charedi girl (I went to co-ed summer camp and was on my school's debate team, so I spent my weekends telling guys that they were **wrong**), but I suspect the author of this article would still feel that I must have simply been dying for male contact. From my observations, the girls I know from all-girls schools are generally less focused on guys than the girls from co-ed schools, although there are naturally some from each who are boy-crazy.

I mean, I won't lie, the male teachers at my school were certainly fantasized about rather a lot (and yes, girls would giggle about them), but it was hardly anyone's focus. Perhaps it's beneficial to have some trustworthy male teachers, to provide a safe outlet for crushes, I don't know. 

I obviously cannot speak for everyone, but as someone who grew up with minimal co-ed social functions (certainly way, way less than the author had!), I don't think I was at all harmed by the experience. On the contrary, going to an all-girls school meant that I was more willing to be my own person, regardless of how that cute guy over there would see my actions. I think the author's ideas of how ""boy-crazy"" all girls are is extremely sad.

Now...I can explain, at least in theory, the three times she woke up in the middle of the night and called her son and his daughter and correctly informed them, to their surprise, that they were pregnant.

For example, maybe at the same time they cracked down on guns, the Australian gov't started adding a new supplement to the water. Unbeknownst to them or anyone else, this additive causes aggressive behavior in people who drink it. Homicide rates go down, because even though people are more aggressive, guns are less available, so people resort to just hitting each other with lawn chairs or whatever is laying around. This means assaults go up. Burglars only drink Pepsi, so they aren't affected, and just go about their business as usual.

Obviously this example is exaggerated and silly, but the point is that there may be other factors at play that affect the stats, even if gun control does have a suppressive effect on crime."

dragonscantfly,MakeupAddiction,1389932398.0,"The biggest eyeshadow tip I give to beginners, that I still use in my own life after doing makeup professionally for 3 years, is this: 

**Try new things right before you'll be taking your makeup off anyway.**

Makeup for photography, HD video? Makeup in 5 minutes? Makeup that'll last all day? There are some makeup techniques that need to be practiced in specific ways. However, if you're just trying to get something to look good enough and you aren't confident in your application technique yet, try it out when you won't care (right before a shower or before bed, usually). If I'm doing makeup before a date, for example, I'll usually stick to something I know. When I mess up makeup, I'm tempted to (and usually do) just take it all off and start over. I have this terribly habit of making a mess with black pigment and it looks very scary. I'm still practicing my blending, and working on ways to play with my mistakes. If you're taking it off anyway, there's a little more incentive to play around and fix/work with it. 

Good luck! I can't wait to see what you do with your new palette. Feel free to PM me some pictures of what you do if you ever want some CC without the nervousness of posting a selfie for all of reddit to see. :)"

For sightreading studies, I got a great exercise from my teacher when I mentioned that I wanted to work on it.

Take every single unit of rhythm between whole notes and eighth notes in a 4/4 measure.  We'll leave triplets out for now.  Pick a note that you can get a good clean attack on.  I used F in the staff.

Find out every single permutation of these rhythms you can fit into a single measure.  Write 'em all out on staff paper.  You can print it for free online just by googling staff paper.

After you've written them all out (it'll take a while), play each measure one at a time until you can visualize every duple rhythm in a single measure of 4/4 time by sight.  Add triplets, do it again.

Start adding ties over the barlines.  Two measure rhythms, three measure rhythms, etc.  Now do it in 3/4.  2/4.  5/4.  6/8.  12/8.  You get the idea.  Start moving notes now.  Go up and down scales.  Play the rhythms in thirds, arpeggios, anything.

Rhythm is the trickiest part of sightreading.  Notes are whatever, but solid rhythm is what keeps people calling you back for the gig.

Also start composing.  By creating your own music, you will become a much better performer of other people's music.  You start thinking about your role in the ensemble from an entirely different perspective."

flashmedallion,metalgearsolid,1389932608.0,"I'm expecting the post-credits conversation to completely shake up everything we thought we knew about the events of Metal Gear 1 and 2.


To summarize really quickly, my wild guess is we'll learn that Big Boss was intentionally tormented/provoked into rebellion by Zero as something of a false-flag operation, in order to create the opportunity for CIPHER/The Patriots to work their way to the top of the political structure.  The whole Lion in the Village thing.

It's possible we discover that Big Boss actually saw it coming, but was so tired/broken (or realising that he can't win) hat he decided to play along with it - possibly with the intent of subtly influencing the young Snakes in order to keep his vision alive once he is gone - and this runs counterpoint to The Bosses sacrifice, which he rejected.  She went knowingly to her death to attempt to end the fighting, while Big Boss goes knowingly to his (possible) defeat in order to set up his revenge against Zero and fan the flames of war across the globe.  Never realizing that a world at war ended up serving Zeros successors (the AIs).

In a nutshell, he decides to play the long game, with the help of Ocelot.

This shouldn't conflict with his appearance in MGS4 too much - he was regretful of what he did - the battles that were waged and the pain that was caused - and realised that The Boss had it right all along."

We still had 35mm projectors at the time they started that and, personally, I would have preferred them send us a real print. And the cost for a ticket went down from $2 to $1 when that happened, since we still had to pay for the licensing, but didn't have to pay for freight/a print.

As far as 4k projection goes, at the time of our install, 4k DLP was still in its infancy (DLP ultimately being the Digital Cinema technology our company went with after a multi-year trial run on different technologies). The CP-2000 series projectors had proven themselves as reliable workhorses and, at the time, had one of the largest install bases in the whole world. You wouldn't have found 4k in any theatre in about 100 miles, minimum, at the time. We were the 'fancy' theatre with our 2k projectors at the time.

einTier,cars,1389933011.0,"""An unfortunate thing that happened to the customer"" is the exact attitude that got this dealership in trouble.  While it was an unfortunate thing that happened to the customer, it wasn't really their problem.  The mindset of the dealer should have been, ""this is an unfortunate thing that happened to First State Chevrolet, but it's going to end up being a win for the customer because we're determined that they end up indisputably better than they were before this accident happened.""  

Everyone fucks up.  It's how you handle those fuckups that make the difference.  They felt like this responsibility was on the customer.   They quickly learned that while they could get away with this 20 years ago but you can't get away with it today.  

I can't believe they've still got the ""woe is me"" attitude.  However, since GM corporate apparently got involved -- and they pretty much had to after this fucking shitstorm -- this dealership is about to find their allotment of ""special"" cars severely limited.  GM doesn't have a lot of leverage with dealerships, but certain cars aren't produced in large numbers and GM is very careful about who gets them.  A crappy dealership might get one or two Corvettes a year and they'll not even be able to order a Z06 or ZR1.  I would suspect they're about to have an impossible time getting anything ""hot"".  "

csreid,Colts,1389933303.0,"The important thing to remember is that the NFL is hard. Even though a lot of people seem to think otherwise, being an NFL running back takes more than strength, speed, and cutting ability. You have to know where to make your cuts, under what conditions, when, how long to wait for a hole... etc. That stuff can take time. Under ideal circumstances, a rookie will come in, learn all that stuff in training camp, and be good to go by week one. 

But for Trent, he had to learn a whole new NFL offense when he came from Bama. Then, later, his OC got fired and he had to learn aNOTHER brand new NFL offense, and probably selectively unlearn some stuff he learned the first time around. Then, mid season, he gets traded and has to try to learn his third offense in just two years. He hasn't had a training camp with Pep and the Indy coaching staff to learn what he's doing. 

If you watch him run, he tends to get stuck behind the line and then drag defenders for three yards. That's partly a function of the offensive line, and partly a function of him not knowing where to go. But the good thing is, you can't teach ox-level strength, and he's shown that he has that. I've watched him drag a DB on his leg for like 8 yards. He's a beast, he just doesn't know what he's doing."

Will_Im_Not,socialskills,1389933430.0,"Yeah, dating can mean ""in a relationship"" but it generally just literally means when two people go on dates.

&gt;But how many dates do you need to go through before the other person is considered your significant other?

The number of dates doesn't matter. You are in a relationship when you and another person decide that you're in one. I'm single and I date multiple people at the same time. Going out for drinks, seeing a movie, and even having sex doesn't necessarily have to be in a relationship.

And forget the ""hints"" and ""conclusions"", if you're curious about your status just ask! Especially after you start getting physical, that's a good time to start clarifying what you guys are. Communication is really important and can prevent a lot of grief and misplaced expectations. 

&gt;If I'm in my third date with a woman, and she doesn't hint that she wants to be more than a friend, doesn't initiate sex, etc., does it mean that she only wants a platonic friendship with me? 

Word of advice, most women won't initiate sex. They'll drop hints (some of which **will** go over your head) but few will outright say ""let's have sex"" or start getting physically aggressive. That's your job to read the cues and make initial contact. Again, if you're getting mixed signals just ask!"

eflaves,AskWomen,1389933481.0,"I'm not sure that the ""sex dies"" wording has to do with frequency. If someone told me ""the sex is dead"", or ""our sex has died"", my first impression would be that the sex is uninteresting and unexciting, not that it doesn't happen at all anymore. Of course, the relationship between enjoyment and frequency of sex is direct. If the sex is boring, you're either 

a) having just as much sex, but you're the only unsatisfied one in the relationship (or the other person is secretly bored too), or 

b) you're having less sex because one or both of you isn't excited about sex anymore.

In a healthy marriage, communication is key. In any relationship, really, so it's fair to assume that in (maybe ""most"" is too strong...) many marriages, the partners are being honest with each other. 

I replied to another comment earlier about how we can assume that childless marriages are more likely to be more... ahem... ""sexy marriages"". For many reasons, such as simple exhaustion (especially in sleep-deprived parents with infants), financial troubles (due to having said child), lack of free time due to working more (for supporting the family). 

And I hate to say it and be really insensitive because I personally know pregnant women who were still just as beautiful as before... but once I get pregnant, I will instantly feel less sexy. I can imagine having that happy glow about me for a while, feeling ""beautiful"" (because of that maternal thing idk), but there's no longer that adventurous, energetic sexual energy inside of me.

A lot of the programming I've done has been for the web, so I am very familiar with... well, almost all of the higher levels of the TCP/IP stack.

I've done the ""blinky light"" thing before... in fact, I spent six years in the Army repairing and maintaining aircraft electrical, electronic and avionics systems.  Like I said in my original post, I have experience with basic electronics troubleshooting and diagnosis.  Maybe I understated my level of experience.

Is an arduino just a microcontroller that's better/easier to learn because it's ""open source""?  (Whatever that means for hardware.)  What's the practical difference between buying an arduino and the sensors, etc. they provide, and buying some ""closed source"" stuff off of Mouser?

I realize that I am totally reinventing the wheel with this project, and that's actually the point.  I'm brushing up on my networking and I realized that I don't actually know how anything below the IP layer *works*.  I figure there's no better way to learn than to build it myself.

The equipment needed for Asylum isn't that bad.  They send you everything but the pull up bar, and realistically, you can do the workout without ever getting one.  Worst case, you can get one on Amazon for $30 with Prime shipping if you want one that looks like the $70 Beachbody version, or you can buy a cheaper one that is just a single bar for $15 - $20.  

It comes with handles and an interchangeable resistance tube as well, so you can go to any Dick's/Sports Authority and buy heavier tubes.  They're also really well made, so that's pretty awesome.  The ladder and jump rope also shouldn't intimidate you.  I did my first round without the jump rope, and it was still a great workout.  The jump rope definitely adds some umph, but if you don't feel coordinated, don't use it.  I honestly spent about 2 weeks prior just doing casual jump roping while watching TV to get myself used to it.  After an hour or so of total time, I was jumping pretty well.  Now, I'm able to do double unders pretty reliably!

It's funny you say that about cheese, everyone says that.  My palate has gotten much more simple.  I get about as excited now for a bowl of brown rice, black beans, avocado, onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms as I used to for a Philly Cheese Steak with extra cheese.  I used to go to the cheese store and eat blocks of cheese while watching Netflix.  It was one of the harder items, but when I realized that most of the time, I was getting crappy quality cheese (Subway, etc), it was easy to cut out.  I just stopped buying the good stuff and my urges went away pretty quickly.

I was talking to the Healthy Eating Specialist at Whole Foods about this, and she told me that studies have been done that show dairy has addictive properties, which is why most people have such a hard time giving it up.  I think I may have been lactose intolerant (and I usually just say I am) because now when I have the smallest amount of dairy, I feel like crap for the rest of the day.  

Again, it worked for me.  Kudos to you for being able to keep those things and get rid of the pounds.

Edit: Also, the whole piano is usually wood and metal, so even the parts that are not the soundboard will add more color to the sound of each and every piano. Every timber is different, and every time a hammer hits a string, at least one or two riders in the felt is different from before. This just cannot be simulated by a digital instrument. "

Inaudible_Whale,punk,1389933663.0,"People don't seem to be interested in sharing and trying new music in equal amounts. People want to shove their favourite band down other people's throats whilst not giving other stuff a reasonable try. That is the fundamental problem with this subreddit I think and I guess it's just part of human nature. It doesn't really help with punk being such a broad genre you could have two people, who are both huge punk fans but have literally no overlap with their tastes. I'm not really sure I have a solution to offer for that problem but it's just something I've observed.

I was a bit cynical about the idea to bring in so many new things at once but after considering it for a while I think it's a fine idea. If something doesn't work or isn't engaging people then it's fine to get rid of it. Throw enough shit at the wall and see what sticks, so to speak.

In regards to being a mod, I would like to be a mod but I fear I'd be too lazy and as soon as anything feels like work to me then I resent it and would want someone else to do it.

For what they would attack is much less probable. They could go for yet another terrorist attack abroad, but its more likely they would try resolve the old Sunni-Shia conflict first. An attack on a Shi'ite holy city, possibly Karbala, would probably be a target.

If a crude weapon, around 100 tons, went off in the Imam Husayn Mosque, the mosque and some of the surrounding area would be obliterated. A much higher-grade weapon, around 10 kilotons, could destroy a significant area of Karbala, killing around 950 people."

It might sound meaningless, but if you have [$20 to spare donate it](http://www.icrc.org/eng/donations/index.jsp) or even less. If everyone in the US donated $20, that is roughly $6.3 billion. The various reddit Kickstarter campaigns Reddit has undertaken goes to show what a few dollars here and there can do. 

Also microlending sites like Kiva will be a good way to help businesses rebuild after its over. National donations from large countries will typically go to rebuilding infrastructure and food/medical aid. But us, as individuals, can help get the local economies going again.

Mephrael,AskReddit,1389933984.0,"&gt; You don't solve it with a public confrontation.

You also don't solve it by pretending it isn't happening. Interestingly enough, there's now [a law in northern Oz](http://remotehealthatlas.nt.gov.au/mandatory_reporting_overview.pdf) where you can be held liable for being a witness to a domestic assault and failing to report it to the authorities. 

This is a good thing, because in many cases, the victim has no idea how to get out of such a situation. 

Note: this does not mean you necessarily should confront an aggressive individual, but you should get as much detail as you can, and report it to authorities that have the training and resources to deal with such a situation.

Ignoring it because you *might* make things worse is a limp wristed excuse to say the least. If you ignore it, I can guarantee that the situation will not get any better.

Nothing that would spoil the game though.  Frankly i think most of the ""game ruining"" issues people are seeing are due to playing a cutting edge game on aging systems (for pc at least, my thoughts dont apply to the console players situation).   

The constant barrage of outrage that is filling this subreddit seems mostly to be propagated by melodramatic teens who  seem to think that DICE owes them.   Whenever these issues come up i tell people to compare the cost per hour that they get out of their game to any other form of entertainment.  The complainers are just impatient spoiled brats who need have the perspective to understand that the game is just that, a game.  You don't need to go rioting in the streets over the issues.  Put the game down for a month or two, go outside for god's sake and come back once the game will run better for you.

That being said, I'm going to kill some noobs hope to see you on."

gyroda,AskMen,1389934167.0,"There's too many connotations attached to the term. I stay the fuck away from it. This is made worse by different people attaching different connotations, so any discussion in which the term is used often just becomes a great big clusterfuck of misunderstanding.

When I hear the term ""friend-zone"" I think ""person likes you as a friend but not romantically"". Nothing wrong with that, shit happens, it can feel crushing sometimes but you get on with your life. Saying that someone ""friend-zone***d***"" you is a little bit silly in my opinion, it's not like they only just put you in that mental category at that moment, but I can see what the term meant originally, shorthand for a certain style of rejection.

What I don't understand is what everyone else means by the terms when they start debating it on the internet. Half of the time I understand people's points, but the other half I think they must mean something completely different by the term.

I've not been explicitly ""friend-zoned"", but I've known when a girl thought of me only as a friend when I had a crush on her. It felt awful at times, but I couldn't just block her out of my life (sixth form + same public transport + shared friend group) and she was an awesome friend regardless. Looking back she probably realised at some point. I don't use the term ""friend-zone"" in relation to this very often because I don't want people to misinterpret me.

monster_woman,offmychest,1389934209.0,"I can be cold and rude, too, I just practice interacting better with people. I try to remember what works and what is good to say and what is not. I'll say or write something and get one reaction, and judging by the feedback I know if I should say or do that again. It's not intuitive but I've gotten good at is providing I don't let my guard down and get too comfortable with myself--then I come across as rude because I am forgetting my manners. But manners can be learned, like I wrote.

I'm not happy or content, either. My general feeling is dead. That's like a happy for me. I've felt happy before, I know I did, because I remember it, but maybe that memory isn't real. I never feel purely happy any more, there's always anxiety with any positive feeling that makes it hardly worth it. I also get uncomfortable talking about this, but so many people here seem to have similar problems and I want to help out so I try to talk about it where I never did before.

So the other day, some well-meaning soul on Reddit asked me what I live for. Which I found odd, because I'm still a person, I'm still human, I was made to be like this by someone. My disorder developed, I wasn't born with it. But I don't really want to talk about that, how it happened. I don't have what you have; I am speaking of the things we share anyway, like reduced affect and the way people react to us. Anyway, point is I never tell nons about my problem because they wouldn't understand. And I told this person what I tell everyone: Our purpose is what we make for ourselves. You make your own purpose in life. I connect with people, just not in the same ways as everyone else. For one thing, I am okay with writing things out, but not so good with talking about what I think. But that's okay, I'm a writer, not a speaker. 

I push people away, too, but I have come to realize that I simply don't want a lot of people in my life. I would be unhappy with lots of friends. It's not the life I want to have. But if you want to make lots of friends, you can make it a goal. You can choose to put in the work. Even for nons, friendship is work, it doesn't just happen. You do what you want with your life. It's your life. And your POV is unique, so share it with people if you feel comfortable doing that. Write, or draw, write songs, whatever. Show people how you see things. It's a good outlet, to be creative. And it's a good way to connect with people, too.

You'll probably just come back and say this is dumb and you're suffering and all that, but I am, too. Each day isn't super great. In fact, most days I'm pretty sad. But I still have things I want to do, and I've made some friends that are really important to me. You can do that, too. It takes work, though."

It's all based on experience. If I said to someone that men with a full head of hair are better lovers than bald men, it's not a stereotype, it's just my observation based on personal experience. I don't expressly find one superior to the other in any respect other than the criteria in question. 

Of course, my definitions of racism and sexism (the dictionary definitions) seem to be a lot different from those of the majority of people I've encountered. I see ""racism"" as clearly implying that one race is superior to the other **in most respects**. I see ""sexism"" as clearly suggesting that one sex is clearly superior to the other **in most respects**. Of course certain races and sexes will be better than the other in some respects; **that's what makes them different**.

So I don't see some seemingly douchey or possibly ""objectifying"" comments as ""sexist"" at all. I just call those kinds of comments ""insensitive"". It takes a LOT to offend me."

If you do go, its IMPORTANT that both of you like the person. If you have to take a couple of them for a test drive before you settle on who to see, then do it. Every counselor is just a person with their own experiences and opinions. It doesn't help if you get a counselor that can't relate to you or your situation. "

Last Sunday we had a vr meetup in minecraft.ch after the Cymatic Bruce twitch stream. At one point we spoke individually to the group of vr players around us. With my rift on, I could see the heads and eyes of the other vr players around me looking and turning like they do at any other public speaking event. Suddenly I was hit with the same jolt of nervousness I feel anytime I'm speaking in front of a group of people. I'm not a shut-in, or a person completely fearful of being in front of large groups. But, there is always that rush that makes my hands shake a little bit more.

fnredditacct,AskReddit,1389934441.0,"I've thought about this a lot since we got married, and my answer is slightly different now.

It's not just that I love(d) him.

I knew that I wanted a partner in life. Someone who was there, everyday, no matter what.  Like, actually come what may.

And while it is good that I like him, and he likes me, and we feel love, there is more than that.

In fact, for us, there is even more than our words and vow not to leave.

He is my husband because he is my match. I am bound to him. I don't know if everyone has a soul mate. But I have longed to be in the geographical locations he lived in, at the time he lived there, as he has moved, since I was a child.  His body fits my body. It matches me. We are a set pair. We have been together for eight years, and everyday I find him more beautiful. Just to see him fills me with such joy it feels impossible to contain. I am never bored by him. Making him happy is the best feeling I have ever known.

He is not the other part of who I am.

He is the glove made perfectly to contour and move with my hand. And I am his.

I knew we *should* spend our lives together. Not that we had to, not that we couldn't have found happiness with other people, because we could have. If one of us dies, I hope we do.

But not to marry and spend our lives together would have been to reject a magical, beautiful gift we have been given.

Choi doesn't have the same background of this season's chefs. This year seemed particularly talented with competitors being executive chefs, chefs who have won Michelin stars or those who been recognized by the James Beard foundation. They most definitely had a culinary education. On the other hand, Choi made his name with food trucks. An entirely different environment for dining, that many think to this day to be rather pedestrian. So when he finally has judging power and when the food prepared is more somber than expected, he can vent out. From I recall, Choi made his first appearance and maybe didn't understand the ramifications of the strict time limit for quick fire challenges.

The rather narrow view is revealed with Carlos. Choi is from Los Angeles yes, and me too. The home of the second largest population of Mexican people. That said, I'd rather rely on Carlos' interpretation of Al Pastor over any Los Angeles restaurant or whatever Choi imagined Al Pastor should taste. [It's not al pastor anyways unless there's meat spinning on a spit]. My belief is that Mexican food served in the US maybe more spiced than prepared in Mexico itself, to play up the exoticism appeal.

This last paragraph maybe is insensitive to sociological notions. I find that Asian-American men to be rather scrupulous when grading. [I'm an Asian American guy myself]. I'm not sure if this is from the confucian-test taking background but every grader or peer that was like me are brutally honest when it comes to doling out criticism and speaking of high expectations. Either this has been conditioned into me from family, my 4 years of college or workplace. That is, whenever an targeted area like education or food comes into peer review, Asian American men do not hold back on admonishments no matter what sort of relation held to the judge."

Saturdays were the worst of the weekend nights, and this particular Saturday was perhaps, the worst one of all: New Year's Eve, though one could easily mistake it for Valentine's Day with all the kissing in here.

""Dr. Saxon!"" Someone called down the hall to the doctor, halting the staccato clicking of her low heels as they kissed the linoleum. She turned her head slowly, her right hand reaching up to remove the earplug that allowed her to be productive in such a noisy environment.

The doctor's eyes widened, and she began to back into a one hundred eighty degree turn that was to be her swift exit. The tone of the nurses pleading, ""*please*, Dr. Saxon! He asked for *you!*"" stopped her short of her escape. *Shit*, she thought to herself. Unfortunately, the Lip Clinic loved to cater to the customer (well, patient), and had a policy where if a doctor was on duty and requested by someone, they were unable to turn down the request.

She knew she never should have become a doctor. All her sympathy for people only ever led to three things: temporary smooch-induced insanity, chapped lips (despite all efforts to keep them slathered in balm), and *this.*

She looked at the name badge clipped to the nurse's pocket.

""Nurse...Phillips, is it?""

The young man nodded feverishly, eyes still the circumference of tennis balls, ""Yes ma'am. It's my first day, and he's... he's asking.."" The nurse found himself unable to finish his sentence as a flush covered his cheeks.

Dr. Saxon groaned, ""Shit, it must be Joshua. Okay, Nurse Phillips, go take a break for fifteen minutes, and clear your head. Sound good?""

The nurse didn't even reply. He just rushed past her, practically hyperventilating as he walked through the automatic sliding doors into the cool, breezy evening air.

Dr. Saxon straightened her back, and steeled her will. She walked in the direction of the more privately located exam room, where they had started placing Joshua for treatment after the first time he came into the Lip Clinic.

If there was one thing that would drive Dr. Angelie Saxon mad faster than the smacking noises all around her, it would be Joshua Frampton, her next door neighbor. Ever since she'd mentioned her occupation in passing, Joshua became one of the clinic's regular afflicted.

Honestly, the first couple times it had happened, she had thought perhaps Joshua was just, well, a little stupid. The dosage was literally written all over the box, and on the information sheet within the box, not to mention on the foil containing the pills themselves. She'd fixed him up and sent him on his way, rolling her eyes and expecting to never see him back in the clinic again.

After the fourth visit, when he had again asked for her personally, and when it was the same ""silly old mix-up,"" as Joshua continually put it, as the three preceding visits, she had figured out what was going on, though unfortunately she couldn't do anything about it. When a patient requests a doctor who's on duty, they have no option to refuse. And Joshua always requested her. Who the hell came up with that policy anyway? Obviously some upper-level image-obsessed executive who didn't have to suffer firsthand because of it.

Dr. Saxon took a pause as she neared the closed door to the office. Taking a deep breath and an extra moment to suppress her irritation, she pulled the cool metal handle and swung the door open as gently as possible.

Joshua Frampton sat with a cocky half-grin on his face, kicking his legs in such an excited manner that the sanitary paper on the observation chair crinkled a sound akin to white noise. When his eyes connected with hers, he shrugged, and gestured down at his lap.

""Hey Dr. Saxon. I had that silly old mix-up again. Thought I was taking my allergy pills, but I guess not! They're a very similar blue, you know!"""

Camera: 

-Price range: Body below $500-700 
(I still need to get a bag for it and everything so less expensive would be great.)
    
-Universal accessories (If I upgrade within the brand I don't want to buy all new stuff.)

-GREAT video

-Fast shutter speed

-Variety of settings for a wide-array of situations

-Long-lasting camera

Me:

-I want to become a photographer/cinematographer/director 

-20 year old college kid amateur

-Eventually want to make some sort of learning program that's interesting like vsauce or Bill Nye or Planet Earth (I know that's not exactly educational) but something to that degree. I want to better society by getting people excited about learning again. 




I know that info about me is probably not relevant and those expectations for my camera in that price range won't immediately be met but aaannny advise will help me at this point. I am a deer in headlights here folks.   

Is the Sony a65 the right buy for me?"

* Just a sip is had, at first that is.  Then a second is asked for, and if they have it then its a much larger sip than the first.

It's an issue when people make the same jokes at you and think they're the most hilarious, most original person in the world. And since you don't think it's funny too, you're just a bitter short person that needs to lighten up.

It's an issue when you repeatedly see comments about being a ""spinner"" or a ""standing blower"" on the internet in the context of pictures of women around or shorter than 5' tall. Like, is that what people in real life are thinking about me all the time, but are just being polite by not saying it?

It's an issue when people on the internet also assume that the ability of a vagina to accommodate a penis is directly proportional to the size of the person with the vagina. (Ie, short female immediately induces people to post that train cramming into the side of a mountain .gif)

So, while short women do not face the added level of dating discrimination that short men face, they still have to put up with all of the other bullshit that goes with being noticeably not-of-average-height."

IndignantChubbs,AdviceAnimals,1389935070.0,"Lol I love getting linked to wikipedia entries on fallacies.

You don't have a citation buddy. You have the death toll of Vitamin A deficiencies, not the total number of lives saved. They'd only be the same number if golden rice eradicated Vitamin A deficiency, which of course it hasn't. So, again, got a citation?

Edit: PS 

&gt; You're saying that rather than remove one part of malnutrition from society that we should seek to remove all malnutrition at once.

I did not say that at all. Total fucking strawman. Obviously you can deal with problems in pieces. (I didn't even need wikipedia to know that -- it's almost like the only people who need to read those articles are children and idiots.) My point was that malnutrition is a sprawling problem that causes a lot of health issues, not just Vitamin A. So throwing out ""millions of lives"" seems hasty. Seems. Like, I was asking for evidence. Like a citation. Which, apparently, offended you. Which makes you an ass.

You're one reactive motherfucker.

Doubleedit: I'm sorry. I got upset but I don't really like to yell at people. I don't want to be angry with you. I'm gonna let my hard feelings go, I invite you to do the same but of course you don't have to. Sorry."

Skulder,patientgamers,1389935109.0,"What it's supposed to be? 

I guess an interactive thriller, with a whodunnit-theme, a few big reveals, and an air of Lovecraftian horror, all set in a survival-horror landscape in a first-person shooter template.

That's what I would say. If the game had a super-easy mode, where killing the monsters didn't take more than rolling your hand on the keyboard, I would recommend it for anyone wondering whether games can be art - simply because of the thrilling and involving storyline, and the games' ability to play with our idea of free will."
