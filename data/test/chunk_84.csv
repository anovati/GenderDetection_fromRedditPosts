Sunfried,explainlikeimfive,1390699404.0,"Atmospheric air pressure at sea level is just under 15psi, but let's say it's exactly 15 because it makes the math easy. That means that the bubbles at 600psi are like atmospheric air compressed to 1/20th of the space.  Those tiny tiny bubbles therefore stop expanding once they expand to 20 times their own size, which is still a really tiny tiny volume compared your mouth or the volume of the candy itself. 

More importantly, the compressed air inside the candy is basically insignificant compared to the size of your mouth, meaning that all that air releasing at once would not significantly raise the pressure in your mouth-- I doubt it would be harmful even if your mouth was filled to capacity, and you couldn't notice the blast of air unless all of the candy was somehow dissolved at once.  But the air isn't even the entire volume of the candy, so it's not like you'd suddenly have 20-mouthfuls of air to contend with suddenly.  The main danger of blasting all that candy in your mouth would be the infections as sugar blew into your lungs and nasal passages, there to feed all the opportunistic bacteria."

To sustain your weight loss, you'll want to limit your deficits to lose about 2 lbs per week.  Thats a 7,000 calorie deficit over 7 days.  It's worth speaking to your doctor or seeking out an estimate of the calories you'd need to maintain - that's a good starting point.  I am 6', female, and 270, and generally eat 1,700 calories a day and have been losing fairly consistently, barring the holidays.  I don't do intense cardio - generally a 30-45 brisk walk a few times a week and stretching/yoga/etc. other days, as I have a lot of pain.  Your body doesn't want to let go of its fat reserves.

The aluminum market tanked 40% in 2008 and they managed to cut production costs, shorten lead times, provide better products to customers, and landed some huge contracts. They're also set to take huge advantage of the expansion of aluminum in the automotive market with patented A951 technology and god relations with companies like Audi, GM, and Ford. In the next few years I expect them to get back up to over $20/share (if they can stop getting caught bribing foreign officials, ugh, last quarter sucked due to those fines.)"

EyebrowsOnSpoons,WritingPrompts,1390700040.0,"You begin to know what they look like, after a while. Depression is a bulgingly fat man, sitting plopped on the shoulders. He winks at you, floats so easy from person to person. I remember attending a funeral where he floated gracefully from person to person, laughing. Laughing like a demented, obese cherub.

Anorexia and bulimia were prettier - models draped in soft, thin clothes. Smiling, laughing out of your peripheral vision until you stared at them head on. Then, quicker than you could see, their eyes were hollow, mouths open and gaping. The insides were lined with razor-sharp teeth and their fingers bled.

As a child, I knew what they were - the spirits of peoples' problems, the demons they faced. 

ADHD - my friend Georgina had this one, a twitching person with disfigured limbs. Fun to watch when she struggled too long on a math problem. She didn't even know for years.

I learned long ago not to tell.

The people never *really* wanted you to. When you mentioned the anxiety, the wide glassy eyes of the specter blinked openandcloseandopenandclosed, yelling silently, ""NO! Don't tell!""

They all wanted to stay hidden. It was easy for other not to see them - but for me, they came with a myriad of symptoms. The sour smell. The obviousness of them. Crouching above people, big as adults themselves and a weird lint gray color.

Georgina slapped me, and her ADHD twitched, turning her neck completely around. I grimaced. 

""Stop making faces,"" Georgina hissed, ""you'll get in trouble."" She turned forwards and I followed suit, trying to hear the teacher. Ugh. Her desk was messy, several apples on it. Pencil strayed. I cringed. 

""Something wrong, Mr. Allaster?"" The teacher asked me. 

I shook my head. ""N-no."" Couldn't she spare four damn minutes to clean? All that dust on her computer. Didn't she ever move it? Pursing her lips, the teacher turned back to her lesson. Her socks were unmatched, too!

""Annoying, right?""

I looked around. No one was talking. Georgina was scribbling down notes as fast as she could manage and everyone else was actually paying attention. Suckers.

""Seriously, couldn't she clean? You can practically *see* the contaminants. ""

The voice was close! Ha! I spun behind me just to see the typical - a messy, crudely organized bookshelf. They're all out of alphabetica--

I looked up. 

A wide grin smiled down at me. ""Hello there. I do believe we've met.""

Of course George is the better character. He grows, he changes, he has depth, we can relate to him. Jerry doesn't grow, doesn't change.

Jerry is who we want to be: witty, attractive, successful. But George is who most of us think we are: short, annoying at times, not as attractive as our friends, not as funny as our friends, personality issues. George is a real person, because he's based on a real person: Larry David. Jerry is a fantasised version of Jerry Seinfeld, created by Jerry Seinfeld. He's not a real character, we cannot connect with him. We fantasise about being him, but we cannot connect with him.

That's why the golf ball skit (""the sea was angry that day, my friends"") works: because it's George. He's a real guy who has been caught out with a lie, and like a lot of people he decides to take that lie to the next level. But, because of the universe he finds himself in, he must step up his game to do so. Just like real life, we don't get the chance to watch things just blow over when caught in a lie, we have a choice to either own up to it, or take it to the next level.

George really is the everyman."

Now that we have banners (this one is called [Oghma](http://d.thumbs.redditmedia.com/s_CoZxho3Lu7djOu.jpg)), numinit and I will get back to working on a scripted auto-rotation of them that will probably run on a weekly cycle (much like the automatic cycling of the date in the header), though if you all would prefer daily (seven new banners, seven days, hmm?) or other frequencies be sure to say so.

As always, the stylesheet is here to make /r/teslore look good for YOU, not for me to show off how raw my CSS game is. So if there's anything you think should be changed or altered, tell the mods, numinit, or myself and I'll either get to it relatively quickly or forget and need another reminder, for which I apologize in advance.

Oh and [magic font](http://myrrlyn.com/resources/fonts/Mage.ttf#Mage) should also work now.

## SELF-PROMOTION THINGS

Have you ever wished you could read a text in its original script setting? If you have had this thought, and specifically referred to the 36 Lessons of Vivec written in the Daedric script, I too had this thought after seeing a Tumblr post about it.

[So I went ahead and made a side-by-side list of the Sermons in Daedric and English](http://myrrlyn.com/apocrypha/books/36-lessons.html). It is in the apocrypha directory solely because I happened to be working in that branch and I wanted to use the stylesheet in it. I'm going through it again and correcting for formatting mistakes (Daedric doesn't have punctuation, so I'm putting spans around the first word of every sentence, killing punctuation and quotation marks, and also spanning sacred words, and then applying CSS to make them stand out). Suggestions are welcome!

When complete, there will be a redirect on the current link, and the end result will be [here](http://myrrlyn.com/texts/36-lessons.html). This link doesn't work yet, because I'm on Sermon Two.

### DO YOU EVEN READ THE SUBREDDIT ANYMORE MYRRLYN

Yes. I've just been busy and would like to publish again sometime soon, plus learning website stuff and new tools and new languages is fun and distracting.

# UPDATE!

PoPs and I agreed that having not one but two Daedric words that flashed to English when you hovered on them overlaid on an **AWESOME NEW BANNER THANKS LADYN** was a bit busy, so I pulled the link back to teslore. User feedback ^^xenoposeidon indicated that there was not full awareness that the word TESLORE in the flag in the sidebar is, in fact, a working link, and there was also some desire to have the subreddit link in the header work because that's what you're used to.

Using approximations now:

NZD1 = USD0.82

3.76 liters = 1 Gallon

3.76 liters would cost NZD7.90 = USD6.45 == Whoa!

Milk: 3L = NZ$5.19. = NZ$6.56/gallon = USD5.35/gallon.

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1390700291.0,"Four reasons. 

1) People have been conditioned to believe women can't do anything wrong and are de facto ""morally good"". 

2) People have conditioned (and rightly, naturally assume) women's advice on attractive women is good and/or reasonable; it's not. 99% of the advice and knowledge women give is wrong, inaccurate, or the most idealistic of whatever cognitive dissonance based world views they may hold. You don't ask a fish how to catch fish; you find a fisherman. Ie. women tend to really believe they want, say, a nice guy, but in reality, only ever hook up with douchebag athletes, therefore, she will tell you she wants X, and she's actually attracted to Y.

3) Men's sexualiy is binary via hypergamy. Men are either quite good or great women women, or bad/not very good with women. Very few men get a good amount of women, but not lots of women, in context, so the men who get a lot can't understand why men who get none, get none, and shame them because they therefore must just be lazy losers. 

4) Most people have no idea how human sexuality works, and it's easier to blame the individual than correctly attribute it to an overarching misunderstanding by both genders how to relate to one another in a fashion that creates success. 

That's not to say that there aren't men who's success with women isn't entirely their own fault, or that natural born losers don't exist."

ILoveBigOil,pics,1390700295.0,"You do understand that a huge reason for the high cost of medical care in the US is because so many Americans are sue-happy and will happily attempt to clean out a doctor if he/she doesn't cure them completely and immediately of whatever ails them, right? The cost of malpractice insurance is ridiculously high for doctors because of this, and they pass part of that cost to the consumer.

Medicine is difficult. It is confusing. It's not always black and white. Often when a doctor finds himself in a grey-area situation they are praying every night that they don't get sued for trying their damn best and using what is available to try and heal the patient...sometimes nothing could have been better but the patient/patient's family will sue anyway.

But that doesn't mean the sounds I make - very loud with the boyfriend - are fake.  Actually, I find that when I have the privacy to make noise, to really let go and scream, the sex is *so* much better.

So there's a bunch of people that feel like you, and what I write is my own personal feelings. I don't expect everyone to feel the same, but I do expect my partner to be on the same page as me.

It's not a question of control for me, it's a question of trust. Relationships are a big deal for me, it takes a lot for me to let my guard down and trust people. 

I've had a lot of casual sex before, which I guess is kind of at odds with how I act in relationships, and I have tried the whole open-relationship thing, but it just didn't work for me. When I'm in a relationship, I give my partner 100% of my romantic and sexual attention, and I need them to do the same. If they don't, then I feel inadequate and jealous and just *bad*.

You can certainly argue that it is unhealthy for people to remain uneducated and neutral about Measure X, but that doesn't change the fact that some people really don't care enough one way or the other to pick a stance.

On a related matter, consider the statement ""If you are not with us, you are against us!"" Do you ever hear people mocking that statement as absurd?

Lord_Seacow,WorldofTanks,1390700645.0,"Tier 3 and 4 can be rough because you often get matched lower (a lot of people playing tier 5's, and tiers 1-2 tend to get matched with each other).  Once you get to tier 5 it'll get a lot better.  For grinding, my recommendation would be to pick one or two lines to focus on for a bit.  Its easier to get a handle on mechanics if you aren't also trying to learn a bunch of different tanks.  The American and Russian lines (med and heavy) are both pretty good to start with.

As for guides, I would recommend going on youtube and twitch and finding guides by or just watching experienced players.  Quickybaby ([twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/quickybaby/profile) and [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/QuickyBabyTV)) and TheMightyJingles ([youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/BohemianEagle)) have been my two favorites.  Jingles is quite good at explaining things for new players, has a lot of videos, and puts out new content regularly.  Quickybaby is my personal favorite, he's a very good player and takes the time to explain what and why he is doing.  He also puts out lots of content, has plenty of tank reviews, and streams regularly."

It is the norm. But like I said, the chances of them acting on it varies. 

&gt; So... are you saying that different women like different things? Because I was under the impression that this is contrary to the core of ""red pill"" theory.

Women are generally like this. When discussing any social dynamic, you can only speak in generalities. Obviously women aren't all the same. They all have variables across the board. However, women tend to lump up in the same general area, much like a bell curve. Though, which attributes they hold and how much of it all varies to a degree. Some chicks are more prone to being gold diggers, while others are very traditional. But for the most part, women do see money as a status of an individuals worth. Women generally want a leader, charismatic, holds his frame, confident, and is the type of person that she herself WANTS to follow by choice. When he stops being a suitable captain that she wants to follow, she'll start looking for a better captain. Now, not all girls can do this because they themselves aren't always valuable. If you are an generally unnatractive chick, you don't really have these hypergamous options as much as a really hot chick does. An unnatractive chick is getting hit on far less, and getting courted far less by quality men. Many chicks sort of ""settle"" for someone around their number scale. 

Given tons of options, most women would be very hypergamous. The same way most men become man whores when they get a lot of options. Celebrities are often like this. Hence the reason we say, ""It's women's nature to be hypergamous."" The same way that it's in man's nature to sleep with as many women as possible. It's just the monkey part of the brain. "

Probably the best thing you can do is bring it up to them before it happens again.

When I was 14 years old, I started working at a summer camp kitchen found out I was actually a pretty good cook and had fun doing it. Fast Forward 2 years, I was working at a local restaurant, found out I was actually really good at this cooking thing, thanks to some guidance from the chef; Not only that it was like having a family of wonderful degenerates that I idolized and looked up to, I was the youngest in the kitchen by far and was treated as the kid brother in the restaurant by everyone (IE- picked on, made fun of, taken out for illegal nights of drinking at other restaurant, had waitresses hooking me up with their friends) and it felt like I BELONGED.

Never looked back, now I'm 23 the head chef of a restaurant, and absolutely love my job and my life. I don't make a lot of money, I don't care. I don't get to have much a personal life (I work 85 some odd hours a week) I'm ok with that, because I get to go to work and cook awesome food, drink wine with guests, and just have a hell of a lot of fun while getting paid.

(before any other chefs start commenting, yes there was an inbetween start and current point where life does immensely suck, you work the hours for not as much money, can't AFFORD to have a personal life, get yelled at, pans thrown at you, cut, burnt and have nights you wonder what you're doing with your life....

Sure. Done. By definition, you win. Racism is prejudice against an individual because of the color of their skin. 

But is it *justified* racism?

Was a slave in 1830s America a racist for harboring feelings of hate toward his white owner and therefore all whites? Blacks are a minority in America (today). In fact, [no one](http://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/list/) on the list of the top 100 richest people in America is black. Not one, let alone 13% (population of the country that's black). Is that because blacks are inferior? Stupid? Of course not. Should they harbor resentment toward their oppressors? Is that *really* racism?"

 Polygynous marriages have existed and even been quite common at times for as long as we've had recorded history and while polyandry is less common, it's not even remotely unheard of, either historically or currently."

If the couple wants to be able to have sex with other people, that should be made clear at the beginning of their relationship and agreed upon by both parties. In that case though, I wouldn't call it cheating. The actual act of cheating is breaking the rules of the relationship that both partners agreed to follow."

&gt; There have been different stories regarding the history of Liglig kingdom. The widely accepted notion states that after the death of Yakshya Malla, the Gorkha kingdom was under Palpa's King Mukunda Sen. After the demise of King Mukunda Sen their sons couldn't control their big kingdom resulting the small kingdoms in Gorkha with the respective administrators being the kings. **In Ligligkot it was decided that whoever won the race from Chepeghat to the Ligligkot top will be the king for next year (however some historians deny it and say that the start point was from Chorkate the other side of the Chepeghat. The race would be organized every Dashain Tika day. The race was started in 1604 BS. The races were always won by the local Ghales.** In 1616 BS, the race was won by the Drabya Shah, brother of then King Narbhupal Shah of Lamjung district. Since then, the Shah dynasty was established in the Ligligkot kingdom and his descendents established the Gorkha kingdom and one of the Shah descendent Prithvi Narayan Shah established Nepal winning small kingdoms scattered around the Gorkha district.

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1390701260.0,"I'm healthy-now-.  I used to think I was before, and indeed I was at a good bodyweight for my frame with a decent diet. But decent wasn't good enough. They found an asymmetrical mole in myself that went so deep it took 3 surgeries in clinic, and then a fourth under general anaesthesia to get all of it out. After every time they took a scalpel to me, I wondered, why me? It wasn't in an area exposed to the sun. It was on my vulva. There was no answer they could give me as to why I had it, but there was suspicion it was cancerous. No one in my family had problems like this, so I can't even say family history could have warned me. 

The antibiotics after the last surgery really wrecked my body. I had yeast infections every month and got common sicknesses a lot, and even contracted athelete's foot on my hands. It ached so bad, I hated my life. My body was vulnerable to everything. I finally read books about nutrition and learned I couldn't just take probiotic pills or eat yogurt now and then. To rebuild my immune system and my gut flora, I needed a very strict, clean diet. I could no longer run 3x a week cuz of the partial vulvectomy, but the ultra healthy diet kept my weight in check. Home made yogurt. No extranneous sugary foods. No pasta, no bread...quite paleo. Lots of fruits abd veggies. Prebiotic foods. After a week I felt better, after a month I felt confident....two months and I knew I was cured. No more infections, no more pain. It's tough to give up foods you love but pain is a good motivator. Now that I'm healthy, with a stronger immune system, I can treat myself to carby stuff. But I can't be careless about it anymore. 

Btw. I've had asthma since childhood. As long as I take my pace easy and guard my lungs against freeezing cold air, I've been able to push myself through over an hour of cardio at a time. Weights are even easier. I've run 10ks and they are easier than my initial 5ks. You can do it, even if you have chronic illness!"

The idea of judging someone else's actions that have no effect on you are pretty ridiculous in my opinion. As it has been discussed many times here and AskWomen, no one is inherently a bad person for not want to date someone who has a long sexual history (well, maybe if they are being a hypocrite about it).

The federal minimum wage was raised from $5.15 to $7.25 when the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 amended the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (no state currently has a minimum wage lower than $5.15), and the FSLA only applies to employees engaged in interstate commerce or employed by an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.[^2](http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8#2)

For example, in the case of Georgia, the minimum wage of $5.15 is only applicable to employers of six or more employees (if fewer than six there is no minimum at all) if the employment isn't subject to the FSLA.

Additionally, it may be of interest to you that for youth under 20, the federal minimum is only $4.25 for the first 90 calendar days of their employment.[^3](http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs32.pdf)"

A damage meter to track damage, dps, hps etc. and some neat bag and chat stuff! 

Overall a very rounded addon.

There's some evidence for the argument that polygyny being the preference over polyandry historically has to do with the fact that in so many societies women were kept as chattel.  In egalitarian societies polyandry and group marriages were far more common than the one guy with 80 wives.

I know you're not defending Christianity, I'm just trying to explain to you that you still have Christian-skewed science and history stuck in your head and it's making you wrong.  Outside of Western civilization in the pre-modern era single-partner life-mating wasn't *nearly* as common as you might think it was, and it still *isn't* in a lot of places(rural India, Africa, Tibet, South America) where Abrahamism hasn't taken hold.  

EDIT:  Also, in the pre-Christian western world that you *do* probably know the history of(namely Greece and Rome), men might marry a woman, but that was generally only for breeding and they'd sleep with lots of other guys for pleasure.

maowsers93,texas,1390702036.0,"The answer is much more complicated than that. HB2 which was the bill we fought against didn't just ban abortion after 20 weeks. It wasn't just 1 bill. It was an omnibus bill that had 4 bills rolled into one. The 20 week abortion bill was just one of them. The other ones were:

First: A bill that said the abortion pill (the actual abortion pill you can take up to 9 weeks of pregnancy not the morning after pill. A lot of people confuse those) had to be administered by the FDA standards.

The problem with that was that the FDA standards hadn't been updated in 13 years. The dosage in the FDA were higher than doctors are actually proscribing women. So, the bill would have forced doctors to give a higher dosage than they normally would.

The real reason they wanted that passed though is because you have to take 2 pills for it. The first you normally take at the clinic and the second you can take at home. You can only take it very early in the first trimester but it is designed for women to be able to do it in the privacy of their own homes. The outdated FDA regulations state that the second dose has to be taken in the clinic as well. This would increase the number of trips for the pill from 2 (because another recent bill was passed making a woman wait a mandatory 24 hours before the pregnancy diagnosis and getting the abortion) to 3 visits. Really 4 because it also mandates that women have to come back to the clinic for a check up but that is unenforceable.

This wouldn't be such an issue for women living in cities but it is a huge issue for women in rural areas and is combined with the other 2 bills to make the procedure harder to get.

Second: The second bill in HB2 mandates that doctors that preform the procedure have to be within 30 miles of a hospital from where it is preformed. This of course will shut the doors of every clinic in rural areas as many of them aren't within 30 miles of a hospital.

The second issue with this is that many of the abortion providers knew they couldn't get hospital admittance privileges for a number of reasons. The biggest being that hospitals don't want pro-life protesters outside of their facilities and if they allow privileges they likely will get just that.

Then when you throw in all the Catholic owned hospitals that won't give admittance (something that a representative of St. Davids testified on warning about) you get the reality that we have right now which is that many doctors won't be able to comply with this law. It is of course designed for that very reason. When 2 of the 4 provisions went into effect late last year there weren't any providers left in the entire city of Austin because of that. One of them was able to finally get admittance privileges though so only one doctor in the entire area of Austin can preform abortions now. For the 400,000 or so women in the area you start to see the problem.

The other issue with this is that abortions are extremely save when preformed under medical care. The risk of injury is only about 0.05% so the need for admittance privileges is unnecessary especially when considering other procedures aren't held to the same standard. Beyond that multiple hospitals and doctors testified that if there were a problem and the woman went to the hospital that the person who preformed the procedure likely wouldn't be the one giving her aid anyway. The active physician on duty would.

Third: This part of the bill mandates that all clinics who provide abortion cervices become ambulatory surgical centers. This was the part that was catching some major publicity because Rick Perry's sister is a lobbyist for the surgical centers. The price of abortion hasn't really risen in 40+ years but to update a clinic to a mini hospital would increase the procedure exponentially which would directly increase profits for the industry Perry's sister lobby's for. Clearly there was a conflict of interest.

Beyond that, 26 or so of the over 40 clinics that provide abortion services in the state of Texas don't even preform surgical abortions. They just write prescriptions for the abortion pill but they too were going to be forced to up grade to surgical centers. Multiple owners of clinics testified that this would cost millions of dollars and they couldn't afford to do it. This particular part of the bill doesn't go into effect until later this year and when it does it is going to close a lot of clinics. It is project to close all but 5 abortion clinics in the entire state. They will all be in major cities so anyone needing the procedure in the Valley or West Texas will have to drive 300 or 500 miles just to get to the clinic.

This is where the 1st bill kicks in. When you need 3 trips to get the procedure and you have to drive 300-500 miles to get there you are looking at an over 1,000 mile round trip. You get the picture.

**Fourth: The 20 week abortion portion of the bill was actually popular amonst many people and would have passed on its own. Many of the Senators and Representative of the legislature that fought against the omnibus bill asked that the bills be split into their own respective bills and be passed or blocked separately. This of course wasn't going to happen because the only way they could get the first 3 passed was to connect it to the 20 week bill. It also gave them an over arching claim to morality over those of us who were fighting against it.**

**Now, I'd like to point out here that when the 20 week bill was first written there were almost no exceptions. It was people like me and a few other women who repeatedly testified against it pointing out that it had no language for fetal anomalies for them to add it to the bill. When they first added it to the bill it was written in entirely non medical language but they eventually changed that too.**

**They still, however, did not add exceptions for rape or the mental health which is a problem because young women in their teens are statistically more likely to get abortions latter in their pregnancies. They are A. not totally aware of their bodies (Thanks to our lack of sex education) and B. some times are victims of rape and incest and are afraid to address their pregnant. At least two school councilors testified that this is a common problem in their schools.**

**The mental health thing is a problem because women who are mentally disabled have a statistically higher rate of sexual abuse, which of course leads me back to the rape topic. There is not language in the 20 week bill to protect everyone who would need the procedure because of complicated circumstances.**

**Furthermore, multiple medical organizations testified that the language in the bill would prevent them from providing medical treatments to miscarrying women. The definition of abortion in the bill was extremely vague and if a doctor provided care to a miscarrying woman and the fetus died he or she could be held liable under the 20 week bill.**

**Only 1.5% of all abortions take place after 20 weeks and most of them are because of problems that arise with the pregnancy. Every pregnant woman gets a fetal scan at 18-20 weeks because it isn't until then that the fetus is large enough to check for structural issues. It is also the age at which gender can be identified. This is the time that most people find out that something is wrong with the fetus. The folks that write these bills like ALEC don't pick the 20 week mark arbitrarily. They pick it because there are a number of abortions that take place afterwards (all be it small at 1.5%) because of structural abnormalities. Preventing the termination of pregnancies that aren't forming normally is cruel and torments families in already terrible situations.**

**This is why Wendy Davis filibustered the bill. This is why multiple representatives and senators including a Republican representative Sarah Davis refused to vote for it and tried to stop it. Greg Abbott knows all of this which is why his comments are extremely immature, insincere, misleading, and disrespectful to the topic at hand.**

So, to ask would she support the ban is disingenuous because the regulations on the clinics were directly linked to the 20 week ban. They had to all get passed together. But no she wasn't for it and she wasn't for it for the reasons I listed. "

goundo,climbing,1390702247.0,"Other posters in this thread seem to be giving reassuring, encouraging responses. I'm going to play devil's advocate for a bit and explain the other side.

First, I would say that, of people I would consider ""climbers"" versus ""some people who occasionally go climbing"" most will be able to consistently climb 5.10 for the rest of their lives, barring traumatic injury. Doesn't matter if the catch the flu, sit on their ass for 10 years, or are 60 years old: they've ingrained climbing technique on their brain well enough that, no matter what shape they are in, they will be able to climb pretty decently. That's the closest thing I can give you to ""what is the average climber climbing?""

As for if I am judging you: I would be lying if I said no. Not in a ""look at that loser flail up the wall"" sort of way, but in the ""I'm not particularly interested in getting to know that person"" sort of way. I go to the gym to climb. Someone who is climbing at the same level as I am might have beta I need, or might want to climb the same routes as me on a trip. Someone who is better than me might have good advice that can give me help in advancing my climbing proficiency. The people who climb the best are often the people who climb the most, and the people who climb the most usually have good stories to tell. However, if you are wearing gym rental shoes, and you are talking about how hard that 5.7 was, I will probably not expend any extra energy introducing myself to you, since, by simple statistics, I will probably never see you again. 

Fortunately, there is a solution if you are stuck in this dilemma: climb more. You'll get better, and therefore become more interesting as a climber. Good on you for getting the membership. And get your girlfriend on rope. Belaying gets old after a while."

fortuna_spins_you,AskMen,1390702483.0,"I am completely in agreement with you about being a responsible adult and understanding the consequences of sex.

My big concern with sex is people seem to always brush off the responsibility of it. Being responsible about sex is more than just using condoms and other forms of birth control. It is about talking to your partner about how they feel if the condom were to break or how will this effect our relationship or how does this make you feel (and not just physically).

It is an adult activity that should be treated as such. Is it fun? Absolutely. But there are risks that people should be educated about and from there, they should make their own decisions. I just think people like to skip the whole ""educating"" part and get down to the good stuff, so to speak."

Celebreth,AskHistorians,1390702897.0,"Hey there! I just saw this post, and I really need to update the book list in the side bar. For starters on the Roman Empire...hm. It's tough to say - I personally learned my knowledge in bits and pieces and puzzled them all together - however, considering that you already know a bit about the army and military tactics, it's *probably* best to start with something that you're more familiar with! So...let's go ahead and hit up the army, shall we? :) 

Starting off, my favourite authour with regards to Roman history is Adrian Goldsworthy. His books aren't only readable - they're *extraordinarily* informative and entertaining, all rolled into one. He's written LOADS of books on Rome, and every single one has been a treat - I can't recommend him highly enough. Unfortunately, I don't know of any Portuguese translations - I hope it'll be alright that they're all in English!

Let's start with book recommendations though :) Regarding the Roman military, there are a couple of books that he's written that'll outline the Roman military WONDERFULLY for you - hell, they definitely were highly useful for me. [*The Complete Roman Army*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Roman-Army-Series/dp/0500288992/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390701899&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+complete+roman+army) is exactly what it says - it's a fantastic book that's not too long, but is completely chock full of information and pictures (It sounds weird that I emphasize this, but seriously. Those pictures are AWESOME). It primarily focuses on the force that we think of when we think ""Roman Army"" - the army of the Principate - but it outlines the Roman army through time.

Next, [*Roman Warfare.*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060838523/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i5?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0AT5V25CZMPHYG7RW919&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1688200382&amp;pf_rd_i=507846) It's similar to the previous book, but focuses on the Roman army in a slightly different way, if that makes sense :) I highly recommend both books if possible.

Finally, with regards to the Roman army and how it helped grow the Republic/Empire, I'll recommend [*In the Name of Rome*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0753817896/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0AT5V25CZMPHYG7RW919&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1688200382&amp;pf_rd_i=507846). This one focuses on the *generals* for the most part, giving short biographies of each, as well as a fantastic background of Rome herself, and how that evolution both influenced and was influenced by these men. 

Now, to the evolution of Rome herself! Since you're familiar with the early republic (sorta), I'd advise reading [*The Fall of Carthage*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0304366420/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i3?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0AT5V25CZMPHYG7RW919&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1688200382&amp;pf_rd_i=507846) - it encompasses a *lot* more than the name suggests, as Dr. Goldsworthy LOVES to describe the background to help you understand the subject intimately - something few people do as well as he does. He begins with Alexander's death in ca. 323 BCE and continues through the legacy of the destruction of Carthage (which occurred in 146 BCE). Want to understand Rome between that time frame? Read this book.

Then, what I consider to be Goldsworthy's finest work - his biography, [*Caesar: Life of a Colossus.*](http://www.amazon.com/Caesar-Life-Colossus-Adrian-Goldsworthy-ebook/dp/B0015R3HJS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390702648&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=life+of+a+colossus) As the name suggests, the book discusses Caesar's life - and, as per Goldsworthy, it discusses *everything* about the society of his life. It's an incredibly good read and I consider it to by my ""bible"" of sorts with regards to the late Roman Republic. If you can only get one book on this list, this is the book that I recommend.

I haven't read anything regarding the Empire (ca. 32 BCE-476 CE), sadly, so I'll leave it there - however, you may be interested in one of Goldsworthy's books that I haven't read quite yet - [*How Rome Fell: Death of a Superpower*](http://www.amazon.com/How-Rome-Fell-Death-Superpower-ebook/dp/B0029F1C1U/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390702815&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=adrian+goldsworthy) 

I hope that helps! :)

EDIT: One more! Barry Strauss' [*The Spartacus War*](http://www.amazon.com/Spartacus-War-Barry-Strauss-ebook/dp/B001UFP6FS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390702964&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+spartacus+war) is a rather brilliant read that gives some great insight into slavery, gladiators, and the Third Servile War (~72 BCE).

Jumping. This is a mixed bag. It can be very useful in avoiding stuff, ***but*** it makes you *super* predictable (especially to sollies, more on this later). So, use it sparingly, but it can be useful.

On scouts, try strafing a lot, use your W and D keys as well as A and S. I can't offer too much more advice than this (I don't play too much scout).

On soldiers (one of my better classes), ***DON""T DOUBLE JUMP IN FRONT OF HIM***, the emphasis is needed. As a soldier when I'm fighting a scout, I wait for them to use their 2 jumps and then I can direct them as the land or put a 60-70 splash damage rocket onto them (by aiming where they're gonna land). So, to beat soldiers, ***GET HEIGHT ADVANTAGE***, my rockets can't shoot up that well. Avoid double jumping and landing on the ground, double jumping off of and back onto a prop that is ***ABOVE*** the soldier is a good use of jumps is acceptable and it's a pretty good strat. Also, jumping away from rockets placed at your feet when you're a fair distance away is a decent use of it too.


Also, did I mention ***GAIN HEIGHT ADVANTAGE*** when fighting sollies. I'm gonna repeat it til you get tired of it because it is such a key fact. If you're on the ground, I can hit ya with splash damage rockets super super easily, but if you're in the air, I gotta go for directs and it's significantly harder for me.

Disconnecting and reconnecting forces a router to recognize the network adapter of the computer, and therefore the router must issue the computer an IP address and update its routing table, which is really just a list of MAC addresses (network adapter hardware addresses, found on every wifi radio, network card, etc., and is not related to Mac computers) and the IP addresses that correspond to them.  Computers added to a network create these lists so they recognize how to route info to each other locally, and this process uses ARP, Address Resolution Protocol.

The routing table can get out of date because routers expire the lease of the IP address that a computer has (meaning that the computer, if disconnected and reconnected, may not get the same IP address), or because the router hasn't heard from the computer in a while and thinks it might be disconnected.  (Rare these days, especially for Wifi, but some computers have their ARP broadcast, which says ""Hey, I'm here on this line, who am I talking to?"" disabled.)

I think everyone who has commented here so far has given quality advise on reaching out to others and reaching out to this friend who hurt you. So instead of re-stating what's already been said, I would like to mention something about depression. Having dealt with it myself, I venture to say that depression sometimes changes perspectives on things like death and grief and sadness. Sometimes those perspectives are very different than the perspectives of those without depression. Maybe you are even feeling some depression because of what has been happening in your life. It could be that your friend is having trouble connecting/communicating with you in a healthy way because of this. Sometimes when two people get together to discuss heavier things, it's consoling. Other times you just have two people who are too heavy for each other. Even if you were very close to your friend at one point, maybe he is not the best friend for this particular situation. As you said, it doesn't make him a bad friend or a bad person, but some people handle situations better than others. 

I know that when I had depression, I was not the best person to talk to about sadness, depression, or death. I was struggling with it and didn't have the answers or healthy solutions for myself, so there wasn't anything healthy I could offer to others on those topics. "

But most small business owners are not ""evil"" and really are operating on very small margins that keep them running. Reducing the margins further could arguably put people out of business.

Firehead94,feedthebeast,1390703220.0,"I agree with point 3. There should be a completely separate entity that is focused and designed around mod making and distribution. FTB/Technic are modpack developers and have no obligation to host mod-development communities. They've done a good job on this up till now but the community has grown too large and the mod count, too many. There should be a place where we can organize, sort and sift through mods based on what they focus on or add. This would increase the likely-hood of lesser known developers getting attention. There should also be an area where modmakers can discuss with server owners, players and other individuals about their intentions with the mod, distribution permissions and how to tell where a bug should be reported (i.e. conflict between IC2 and Solar Arrays, whose issue is it and where to report it). Many modmakers have a bug-report system setup whether it be on one of probably 3 forum posts they've made, a github issue tracker or something similar. If we can condense this down to one place where bugs could be reported, it would make it far easier to keep track of. Im not saying to get rid of issue trackers like github but there are several people who know nothing more than download, drag and drop and have no clue as to what github is. 

**TL;DR Modding community is too large to be hosted in a subforum of a modpack development site. Should be hosted on a completely separate entity designed around modmaking and distribution over modpack distribution.** 


Note that Im not slandering FTB in anyway, Im just stating that they are a modpack dev team while mod makers are not. 2 separate entities should remain as such to keep discussions relevant, focused and constructive."

She mentioned he has depression. One of the things I experienced in my depression was that sometimes I wasn't capable of being there for other people as much as I wanted to, or as much as I should have. It took all my energy just to get up in the morning, and a single setback could lead to me having trouble eating for days. It wasn't that I didn't feel sympathy, or sorrow, for the people in my life who were having a rough time. I just wasn't able to support them the way I wanted to. Depression is a selfish disease that takes up all of your resources in a way that makes it really, really hard to be there for other people.

That being said, to the OP, you may want to take a break from this friendship while you're grieving. If he couldn't be there for you so close to your father's death, he'll probably have an even harder time showing compassion farther from the day. Sometimes depressed people aren't capable of being anything but a fair weather friend, and his lack of support is going to hurt. He may be doing the best that he can, but you don't have to pretend that it's enough. You need to focus on yourself for a while, and depressed people are really good at making people focus on them instead. 

If it'll make you feel better, by all means confront him, but if his disease is as serious as you say I don't think it will change his behavior. "

In order to afford said machinery and the first launch I plan to market said factories on earth - fully automated, self-configuring manufacturing facilities.

The trick is building the first one.  I imagine a set of robot arms that can build a copy of themselves to be a good starting point - after that it's a question of how many arms and what are they doing.

Right from the start I knew that my robots had to pay for themselves so I could invest maximum time in R&amp;D.  That means whatever I design has to be consumable by others, either as a kit that can sell in the hundreds or as one-off art piece at extravagant prices.  I chose kits because there's a bigger market, so I have to design for manufacturing and learn all about running a business.

So that pretty much brings you up to date on where I'm at.  I just released this robot, I have another new thing coming February, and if i'm really lucky I might even have another in Smarch.  I also just created learn.marginallyclever.com, which will start as a place to collate all the ""how to assemble"" documents and expand later with more educational stuff.

I'd love to attend more conventions and connect with more bloggers, resellers, and other strategic partners.  If you can think of any way to help me grow faster and reach my goal quicker it would be awesome and you have my full attention.

The mag well is essentially a copy of an AR15's, while the QBZ-95's is similar to an AK's ""rock-in"" type. With the QBZ's mag well there isn't really any issue in ejecting magazines, but the AR15 type has a standard button release on the right side of the rifle making it extremely awkward to remove your mags! As you can see in my photo there is a release on the left side which I fabricated.

Certainly, but it's probably a matter of wanting to trick themselves into thinking they've got some new righteous purpose and (probably reaching) to give themselves a chance at redemption. E-cigs are so tied to the image of cigarettes where most Federal health agencies fucked up royally. So they probably see vaping as the heir apparent to the Dark Lord of Tobacco and they want to be the saviors. Nicotine is certainly to blame for decades of slow suicide from analogs, so given that it's so prevalent in juice, they view vaping as the next big killer (dumb, I know).

(the reason satellite is bad for gaming is a geostationary satellite has to be an outrageous distance away from the earth to stay above the same spot on earth in a 24 hour rotation. Something like 22,000 miles so the latency is poor due to the speed of light up and back.)"

Um_is_this_taken_yet,Catholicism,1390704262.0,"1) Well, Leviticus really has nothing to do with it to be honest. The first point I want to make is that everyone (married, single, man, woman) is called to chastity. If a married couple is using contraception they are in the same state of lust that a same-sex couple would be in. The gift of sex was given to man for the purpose of procreation. Since a man and a man (or a woman and a woman) cannot bear children through their union, they cannot be married. There are Catholics who suffer (and yes, they suffer) from same sex attraction who are celibate because of it. They choose to live a life of celibacy because of this cross they have to bear. Is celibacy a lot to ask? Yes, but so was dying for your sins. 


2) I'm not preventing other people from indulging in it but, I would never want to see two men or two women be married by a priest in a Catholic church. Why can't we just call it a civil union and be done with it? If they wish the path do God lying to them about a state of lust they are living in won't help.

attakburr,Seattle,1390704576.0,"So, generally most places will let you take unpaid Time Off within in reason. Only have 2 days PTO, but have a 1 week vacation planned? As long as your vacation isn't next week, most places will be fine with letting you use 3 days unpaid. They are literally not paying you so it's not an issue to them. Where it becomes an issue is if you try to take an unpaid day every two weeks or something like that and it's interfering with your ability to fulfill your responsibilities in a timely manner.

That said, I have had friends/family in WA and elsewhere who negotiated for a shorter work week for the same amount of pay rather than taking their raise. Aka, 4 days a week instead of the raise. Or, 1.5 weeks of extra PTO rather than a raise."

I feel a bit better and less likely to explode, but I'm probably going to come across overly antagonistic and I apologise. I'm also typing on my phone with ridiculous fake nails so I apologise for errors too.

My nurse is trying to bring my appointment with my psychiatrist forward. I had one in December cancelled due to their clerical error. My GP has been advocating for more control over my meds but the psych is on holiday until beginning of Feb.  My GP and nurse have both said long term they want me off the Seroquel but I'm too unstable for it now, psychiatrist gets that decision.

Relationships... I just feel like I'm wasting the other person's time and they all get attached too fast for me.

Interpersonal... I hear that phrase they're more scared of you than you are of them. The thing is, I'm perfectly fine not having friendships. I feel like I'm wasting their time trying to get to know each other because I really couldn't give a fuck. Apparently friendships are healthy so I know I should. But to just be a shallow fake friend to someone who feels there's a connection? I know that's wrong. It's similar to the romantic relationships.

I completed 3 years of uni and made no connections. I had panic attacks when doing any kind of competitive activity and would have to physically hold myself down in class. Surely someone else in the class, any class, can be first to say hi? I just don't quite understand how to navigate all this.

I'm having real trouble finding an outlet. Been thinking of it for a while and working with my therapist weekly with nothing to show for it in this area. I don't consider myself creative. I've been trying to go on decent walks but the heat and sun on my skin is too much at the moment. Plus mum gets scared haha

One thing I've wanted is a long term goal but everyone around me has tried to discourage that. I'm not good at identifying those small things because I can't see where they're leading. If I'm going to measure progress I need a goal and I need it to be measurable.
Stepping foot on uni grounds again has been one. But everything keeps getting scarier from there. I don't even know if I want to study what I'm going to be doing. This is my fourth change of degree so far and now that I'm dependent on mum and getting older I feel like time is running it."

sorabird,TwoXChromosomes,1390704765.0,"I think it sometimes goes hand in hand, actually. My boyfriend thought I was fairly manipulative when I was depressed, and while I couldn't see it at the time now that I'm medicated and functioning like a normal person I would agree with him. It wasn't that I wanted to be that way, or that I was doing it intentionally, but there were days when I legitimately couldn't do something and would say pretty much whatever I had to to get out of it. I can't think of a concrete example as one of my symptoms was also issues with memory. Of course, it's also possible that he's a manipulative person outside of the disease, but it definitely could be playing a part.

One of the worst parts about it for me was the shame. I knew there were all these things I needed to be doing to support my boyfriend and my friends, and I *couldn't do it.* And it was one of the worst feelings in the world. I think it's a large part of why so many people with depression have such self-loathing. I really feel for OP, but I feel for her friend, too, because he's probably feeling like the shittiest person in the world for being unable to help her.

I appreciate your curiosity and how polite you are about it. A lot of people have really messed up views about what it's like to be depressed, and I'm always a little afraid of backlash. Allie Brosh from Hyperbole and a Half has a couple really great posts about what it's like if you haven't read them. "

Also, a few gay porn sites don't mean he's gay. Maybe he's bisexual or maybe it just gets him off. Hell I've watched lesbian porn before and I am totally straight.

The lack of sex is probably a result of the depression, not of him hiding the fact he's gay, too."

Many of these petty criminals come from low socio-economic backgrounds, and have a poor quality of life.  Because of this, they get sucked in to the bad side of things usually out of desperation to take some kind of control of their lifes (although that's never what really happens).

A prison like this has the potential to show them what a good life should be like, as long as it is done with appropriate work and training at the same time.  Why would they want to go back to life on the streets, when their new life is so much better?  They can't stay in prison indefinitely, so they have to use the training they received in the prison to improve their life outside of the prison."

I looked it up on [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Formula_(1980_film) and I think it just got put through the ringer.  Movies about social significance aren't always a big draw and it also depends on what it's up against.

All the main stars were older (not that that matters) and this was released during the Christmas season.  Maybe not the best time.  

I think this film hit some significant points right on the head and it might have gone *over* the heads of the viewing audience at the time.

I'm not that knowledgeable as I'd like to be on WWII (yet anyways) but I guess the Nazis had created a ""formula"" for pure crude that would then eliminate the dependency on foreign oil or oil itself which would then crush one of the world's major economical forces of the time.

RoEdhel,legaladvice,1390704970.0,"01. SSDI payments could be garnished...if it was a federally owned student loan. Otherwise, proof of benefits ought to make you exempt from payment (like, for example, if there is a judgment). 

02. The collections company very likely does not own the debt. They have been hired to collect it. You can ask for a validation of the debt to buy yourself time - and they cannot overshadow the validation period with offers of settlement that expire before the validation period does. Validation period can last up to the 30 days. You can ask to see the assignment or bill of sale/chain of title. 

03. Someone here has mentioned showing up to court. I don't know about Cali, but where I am, the only reason you'd have a court date like that is for small claims. If that's the case, being ready with proof of benefits and a current summation of your finances can be helpful. But then it's really up to the judge and whether the case is dismissed with or without prejudice. If it's a civil suit, it's going be more difficult, so I won't address the ins and outs of that here. It probably runs too much into the arena of actual legal advice.

Sunfried,explainlikeimfive,1390705024.0,"In those times when time seems to slow down during a violent or unexpected event, it's because your brain is recording memories more carefully when the unexpected is happening. Your brain sometimes ignores sensory information in favor of just taking what it predicted would happen as having actually happened (which is why sleight-of-hand an other fake-outs work).  When shit hits the fan, though, your brain begins to record things carefully.  [You're not seeing time move slower](http://www.radiolab.org/story/94840-letting-go/), you're just experiencing (adding to your memory) life more richly all of a sudden.  It would be very useful to be able to engage this at will, especially for skilled detective like Holmes, but if that's possible, I'm not aware of it.

The canonical Holmes is a thorough educated man who has extraordinary, maybe superhuman, powers of memory retention and recall.  So when he looks at something he begins to make intuitive connections like everyone does, but he does it at a higher rate than normal-- so much higher it seems like a super-power, but if he was real, you'd probably just call him ""high-functioning"" or similar.  I don't know if it's possible to function at his level, though. The Limitless drug is very similar-- perfect recall, effortless connection of information, without going off-topic or losing focus-- such a drug would be no good if every user ended up getting caught up in utter trivia, and getting caught up in trivia is something everyone is prone to doing.

Holmes plays the odds sometimes, though-- you may recall the first episode of Sherlock in which he deduced the identity of Watson's caller (at their first meeting), but mistook on the caller's gender. I've seen other Sherlocks do this (e.g. the outstanding Jeremy Brett in the 1980s BBC series), so I'm inclined to think he played the odds in the books, but I haven't read them."

Corbenik,whowouldwin,1390705027.0,"Sauron was represented as the eye in the movies, but he was basically formless in the lore. His previous form had been destroyed and he lacked the power to reconstitute himself without the ring.

So he basically was incapable of acting directly. For the most part he acted through the Nazgul, who *were* quite powerful, his armies, and by influencing the various ring bearers.

I would say that a battle between movie Sauron (the eye) and movie Gandalf would probably be a draw, as Gandalf has no way to really defeat Sauron but Sauron has all of the same limitations that he has in the books.

A battle between lore Gandalf and lore Sauron during the books would be impossible, unless you count him trying to destroy the ring.

Triplanetary,socialism,1390705037.0,"Middle class people are like house slaves. They're in a slightly better material position than the other slaves, and thus many of them take the side of their masters in an attempt to preserve the few privileges they're granted. But they're still slaves.

Middle class people operate under the delusion that they're in a position of financial stability and security, a position they believe they've built for themselves through hard work and responsibility. Every economic recession or depression necessarily shakes a few of them from that delusion, forces them to realize firsthand that everything they ""own,"" they own only at the convenience of the capitalists. But the ones who remain largely unharmed continue to believe that they were unharmed because of their responsibility and hard work.

The middle class struggle isn't quite the same as that of the lower class, because unlike those who live in poverty, *most* of those in the middle class can live in material comfort under the status quo, as long as they remain lucky and aren't one of the ones who have the rug pulled out from under them in the next recession. Certainly they would be better off fighting for socialism and *real* security of their livelihoods, but try making them realize that as long as they remain one of the lucky ones."

Firehead94,feedthebeast,1390705060.0,"I didnt start playing modded minecraft until almost exactly a year ago (actually, i think it was exactly a year ago). I played BC around the time wells were added but only for a short time so I dont really count it. Since I started 1 year ago, I've played on the same server, taught myself how to run a server, learned LUA from computer craft, used that to teach myself java and now I own that very same server I started on. Not once have i actually played on another modded server but everyone on my server enjoys both the staff and the custom modpack we have. We dont get complemented much and dont do much in the way of advertising but thanks to the players we've had, Ive only had to pay $60 USD out of pocket to keep it going since I took over in June. It can be stressful at times when Im debugging between mods and mcpc+ but most of the time we figure it out and fix what we can as soon as possible. 


Our server 2 year anniversary is the 8th of next month and were making a cake!

since 1480841 did some nostalgia, i thought id do some too ;P

WeaponsGradeHumanity,WorldofTanks,1390705086.0,"The KV-1 is a brute and should be played that way, at least in tier five games.  A KV-1 is a big threat and your job when driving it is to place that threat somewhere the enemy can't afford to ignore.  You know how people rush down the hills of El Halluf trying to hit the guy in the cap circle but never make it as far as the rock?  Your job is to make that happen on all the other maps too.  Drive into a place they can't let you hold and force the enemy to make hasty mistakes trying to get you out.  Use cover, terrain and your armour to make them come at you from angles that your team has covered.  Wipe out as many little tanks as you can and hunt down the big hitters on the enemy team so that they can't do the same to you.  

Of course, if you're in a higher tier then you can afford to let other people do the heavy lifting.  Watch where everyone goes and put your KV somewhere it can cover whatever they've left open.  That way you still have the option of reinforcing a flank or returning to base if a column gets wiped out.  "

trousercobra,VictoriaBC,1390705120.0,"This is just my thoughts on that note, not every rider will agree with me....

&gt;After looking into the issue it seems that horses are 'fight or flight' animals that can be hard to control. Am I a jerk for expecting someone to control the 1000lb animal they brought to the 'party'? 

They are. I don't think one should be taking a horse off their property unless it's broke enough to have a good amount of control over it. If I have one that I *know* is prone to a complete meltdown over bikes, I won't take it where I know bikes are. That said, they're still animals, and they still have a brain of their own. I've had horses that don't bat an eye at anything, see their own shadow strangely and go postal, just because it's a bad day for them lol. 

It's not unfair to expect them to be able to control the situation if it gets ugly (I don't wanna say control the horse, because really, you never really have ""control""... they just choose to go along with you, imo), but just bear in mind that even the brokest horses can have an ""off"" day. I've been out at shows or such and a horse has gone batty over something, and I automatically go ""seriously? why bring him? he's obviously not suitable to be here, train him some more"", then remembered that that horse could be the most laidback one there normally.

&gt;I feel that if I slow way down on my bicycle and alert the other party to my presence I should not have to stop or pass in fear as the rider tells me their horse is 'skittish'.

And this is where both parties should work together, so to speak. The rider needs to communicate with you, and you need to communicate with them. They should, imo, let you know how to approach; ""it's okay, keep going!"" or ""sorry, he's a little nervous about bikes. Can you give me a second to get out of the way so you can keep going?"" are my typical ways of handling it. You're probably going to be moving faster on your bike than I am on horseback (assuming I'm just walking), dick move to expect you to creep at a snail's pace behind me. If I *know* my horse won't react well, I'll get as far off the trail as I can to make room, and hop off and hold my horse if need be while you pass. Obviously, not every rider reacts that way, though. 

TL;DR communicate, politely, with everyone else, whether you're on a bike, on foot with or without a pet, or on a horse."

Are you saying that if we found a way for people to eat whatever or however much they want without it affecting their health we shouldn't do it? What's the point of advancing technology if we can't use it to our advantage?

It's okay if you don't want to date women with multiple sexual partners. But believe it or not, there are many men who don't care, and many who prefer it. If it were basic evolutionary instinct this would not be the case. And even if it is, it's irrelevant now and serves no purpose.

Devium92,AskReddit,1390705589.0,"To be fair some places are going to basically pyramid scheme you. But we looked into it and our family doctor told us it was a good idea to look into Chiro as a support for anything medical. My doctor doesn't know how to safely reduce the tension in my neck that leads to some of my headaches/migraines. Not without a prescription pain medication or muscle relaxer. Whereas a chiropractor will know what to do. 

The ones who go ""take this herbal supplement that I've formulated, and go to this specific gym, and do this and oh my bill will be $50,000 and you'll need these special pieces of equipment in your home that only I sell"" yeah run away from those.

The Chiro I went to never pushed anything on you. I saw him once every two weeks. I knew when I hadn't seen him for an extended period of time (vacations and emergencies etc etc) because my neck would be sore, I'd be having really bad headaches that no medications could ever touch. 

Usually something like a tension headache or a sore muscle in the neck/shoulder area are from stress. I personally get almost a pinched nerve in my neck when I get stressed out. So sometimes it's as simple as just chilling out. Sometimes it requires an adjustment from a chiro, and sometimes it's beyond a chiro and it requires a prescription from your GP, or even a specialist. 

I'm not saying a Chiro is going to be able to fix everything. I don't think it ever did me anything better than maybe going to my GP and just taking it easy would have. But when you've had bronchitis for 2 weeks and your chest feels super tight and you can't breathe between the congestion and the stressed out muscles, having the chiropractor crack my ""chest"" (may have just been my upper back I really don't know, but when he said I'd feel ""popcorn"" holy shit he wasn't kidding!) that first breathe where it doesn't feel like I'm not getting enough air is amazing.

But as time goes on I'll probably throw in a Music Theory 101 lesson or two as a sort of prequel to what I'm teaching now.

I purposefully avoided the ""12 pitches equally spaced"" bit because I'm starting from a Just Intonation point of view, and I'm saying ""I'm going to justify Why These Notes"" and ""12 pitches equally spaced is an assumption that I haven't (yet) justified. Though I do sort of touch on this in the next lesson, which is uploading now.

I agree though, I probably ramble and can probably tighten it up a bit. I combined what was originally the intro to the whole series (a 4 minute clip) into this one because I figured it'd be better to just jump right into thing than to have a pointless clip that laid out my intentions but taught nothing. Perhaps one day I'll re-record these with those notes in mind. For now my goal is to just get the complete set of lessons up so they're out there for people to use &amp; benefit from.

That being said, Sora and Riku's keybladeless feats put them roughly at the same spot as Jin and Mugen's higher (but not highest) tier enemies.  I'd give it to Jin and Mugen, as both are capable of cutting much faster than keybladeless Sora and Riku. Especially Riku, as he cuts at what is basically a normal well trained swordsman's speed.

I'd be very surprised if you had ""no way"" to prove he lived with you. Grocery bills, school supply receipts, signed consent forms, and many other things can be used to prove residency of a child.

Edit: Your best bet is to file before her. The IRS tax return acceptance system automatically picks up and flags issues when it comes to qualifying children. If you file before her and she tries to do the same, the burden of proof will be on her. I know that's probably not the way you want to go about it, but it's the simplest path from your position. "

As for McGary, some scouts still project him as a late first rounder like 28-30th, and will be willing to take a gamble on him even though he's hurt and will miss the remainder of the season.  If GRIII and Nik both leave, McGary will be gone, as long as he is still projected to be drafted.  Even if he's seen as a 2nd rounder, I think he leaves because the only reason he came back this year is so that he could play with GRIII as the 1/2 options of Michigan."

Njal_The_Beardless,space,1390706755.0,"A fully robotic base on the Moon makes a lot of since when it comes to mining. I think all the other industries that would spring up on the Moon would require a constant human presence though. Like I said earlier there would be telescopes and all sorts of other experiments that could take advantage of the Moon's unique environment. Most of these experiments would have humans directly working on the surface. Other than that, there is tourism. If we can ever build a stable base on the Moon tourism is sure to follow. All sorts of things would attract people there: history, science, adventure. Sports could eventually migrate onto the Moon. You can actually fly on the Moon with wings! [This article](http://www.universetoday.com/19710/gravity-on-the-moon/) kinda talks about that.

All of this though would require major engineering, no doubt. A base on Ceres or Mars would require even more engineering however. To add to that, we would have no place to test the hardware except on Earth and the location! [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fturU0u5KJo&amp;list=FLIFdIB-zSsOt4uu4Bi7I5sg&amp;index=41) is a great video on the complexities of a mission to Mars.

Also, number of assaults with a firearm did go down but number of assault victims total went from 123,940 to 486,500. That's victims not assaults, some of them may have been victimized repeatedly. Additionally, it looks like number of assault victims grew most as a percentage of total amongst women and the elderly. Of course, this does not show that less guns means more assaults but it does show growing levels of violence in Australia over the last decade and change. "

WalterSkinnerFBI,CollegeBasketball,1390706873.0,"Dorm storm. Drag people to games.

Some student sections do ""points"" for games that can be used for school gear, preferred seats, that kind of thing. Sometimes they'll offer bonus to those who are willing to go to certain lower-attendence things like bigger WBB matchups.

Get the fraternities/sororities involved. Can you partner with THON for something?

Partner with the athletic department if you don't already. Have pre-game tailgates in the union or whatever else is nearby, get the coach to show up, too. It's not out of the ordinary - other places absolutely do that. 

Partner with student government for awareness. There are absolutely things that can be done that way.

You have the benefit of having nothing else in town to compete - no pro sports, nothing. And in the winter it's Wal-Mart (actually you guys have a Wegmans, so I'm jealous of that), the 17th party this week, or the game. Make the game the place to be. Make it fun so that people *want* to come back, win or lose. It can't be all ""WE ARE..."" chants and ""DEE-FENSE"" and stuff because that's not that fun to be a part of after a while. Think about the schools that do the thing to ""Uprising"" or the ""I believe that we will win"" thing. Different stuff. It's all derivative, yes, so use whatever will resonate with the other students and just make it a great time. 

You need to foster an image, that the biggest party in State College on game day is in your student section. You also need to make it personally important to the students, and that's where things like the tailgate, appearances by the Coach, etc. enter in."

Smartdiablo,hardbodies,1390706896.0,"The pec fly machine you're thinking of IS the rear delt machine.

These machines have two retractable pins at the base of the handles that you pull in order to set it for the desired exercise.  When the handles are set to the sides it is set for a pectoral exercise by having the user place their back on the pad and squeezing the handles towards the center of the chest.  

When the handles are placed behind the pad using the aforementioned pin assembly, the machine is set for a rear delt exercise by having the user place their chest on the pad and having the user pull the handles apart as seen in the GIF.

To answer your question, IMO she could undoubtedly separate it from her back workout and more than likely was working on her shoulders when this video was made.

If you ending up feeling the tension in your trapezius muscle as opposed to your rear delt while performing this exercise with free weights, (in a bent over row position pulling dumbbells away from you in an arching motion) chances are your range of motion may be flawed pulling the weights in a ""V"" motion as opposed to a ""T"" motion.

As for middle delts, I like to use a seated lateral raise where you ""flap your wings"" out to your side using light to moderate weight keeping strict form ( using a 90 degree set bench, back glued to the pad, chest out, slight bend at the elbow, and a small pouring rotation of the wrist at the top of the rep and letting the weight com to a complete stop at the side of the seat.)

red_one2012,AskMen,1390706925.0,"The sex positive movement is an easily researched topic and it's not something that should be interpreted or misinterpreted once you read about it. 

For instance, you are selecting a small part of it (to not be judged for sexual kinks) and making that to be the entire basis of the movement. When really the idea is to not judge anyone for their sexual practices, no matter what they are, as long as it is safe and consensual. (Just to prevent any possible misunderstanding, clearly pedophilia is not included in the 'no matter what' category since that cannot be consensual. Same for bestiality, etc.)

If someone is sex positive it means they will not judge or shame others. That could mean that you are a sex positive person who is celibate, you could be sex positive and in a monogamous relationship or you could have multiple partners. No matter what the key is that you practice sex safely, are educated about it and you believe that the personal choices of others are exactly that...their choice.

Your sensitivity issue may have to do with your circumcision. Cutting through skin, membrane, blood vessels, and nerves is pretty indiscriminate on an infant's penis. They use a one-size-fits-all tool in most cases.

I'm just remembering how I lost 1/4 of the sensation in my tongue after wisdom tooth removal. Cutting nerves can have unpredictable results.

As for adults, common sense dictates that when you cut away 1/3 of the nerve endings and half the skin of the penis, you're going to impact sensations in the penis."

rrandomhero,MensRights,1390707001.0,"I would disagree, there was a video posted a while back of some guy who addressed this and he made a great point. After the semen leaves your body, you have already made your choice. You decided not to use contraceptives and you made your choice already. If you didn't want a kid and you got a girl pregnant you missed several opportunities to prevent that. 

1. you could have not had sex in the first place. Since everyone is *human* and sex is awesome this isn't always the #1 choice, nor does it have to be. 
2. Condoms. They are incredibly effective, and should be used regardless if you are having sex with a partner outside of a monogamous relationship.
3. Vasectomy. If you **really** are sure you don't want kids ever, just get a vasectomy. You cannot possibly get a woman pregnant and if a woman tries to lie that you got her pregnant, you can absolutely prove you can't be the father.

It's easy to make an argument like this, but you are **EQUALLY** responsible, regardless of gender, for safe sex and use of contraceptives if you are not prepared to be a parent. Sex has consequences if you aren't smart about it. A woman has just as much right to terminate a pregnancy as you have to prevent it from happening in the first place.

Porn is a highly regulated industry with contracts signed and records kept before videos are ever shot(That's what that ""custodian of records"" bit you see at the start of professional porn is).  All that ""reality"" porn you see with guys picking random girls up/pretending to audition them for something/tricking or manipulating them in some other manner is staged.  Telling a woman you're shooting a porn and that you're going to pay her for being in that porn, then not paying her, could easily fall under ""rape by deception,"" no to mention all sorts of labor and contract violations.

Same deal with the insults and, to some extent, the crying.  It's all part of the setup and yeah I imagine sometimes the crying isn't staged(where the fuck are you watching porn that you're seeing this so often?  I've seen that ""oh god what choices have I made that led me to this?"" look in a woman's eyes in porn before, sure, but full-out crying, so often that you're theorizing about it?), but all the choking/slapping/insulting/screaming/etc is part of the show.

&gt; No other province [Valenwood] suffered more during the Imperial Simulacrum than Valenwood. With the Empire unwilling to lend its assistance and defend her, the land was attacked from the east by Elsweyr and from the west by Summerset Isle, both taking sizable chunks of the Bosmeri land.

That was only during a certain time though and with Valenwood being attacked by two provinces at the same times it's not surprising that they had difficulty fighting them off. I'd say there must haven't been too much ass kicking or else Valenwood would seize to be. The Bosmer have held it together well. "

puaSenator,PurplePillDebate,1390707387.0,"Of course, I'm not saying women don't trying to repair relationships and just branch swing soon as there is an issue. However, they are hypergamous -- some more than others. But it would be ridiculous to think women don't try to repair a relationship they've invested so much into. 

However, I see the hypergamous nature of women first hand ALL THE TIME. I'll give some light subtle exampels rather than the obviously extreme examples to make a point -- maybe so you can see where I'm coming from. Usually if she has a boyfriend, when her boyfriend is somehow brought up either intentionally or accidentally, 90% it's ""Yeah, we are having issues at the moment though."" It doesn't necessarily means she wants to fuck me or intends to cheat. But it usually means that she has at least some basic level of interest. This is her way of sort of waving the worry I may have of her having a BF. It makes it a little more okay for her to lightly flirt with me in her mind, or at the very least, let me flirt with her.

I don't even hook up with cheating women, but many times these same women offer their number just as friends. Some genuinely believe it just as friends. But at the same time, whenever they go out w/o their boyfriend, she'll invite me to come hang out, just as friends. Guess who they call soon as they break up with their boyfriends? Me, and likely 3 other guys they've been keeping around, ""Just as friends."" I usually don't put myself in these situations intentionally because I know what they are doing, and don't want to be the cause of cheating and/or their relationship deteriorating. Yes, men and women both do this, but in my personal experience, this is done WAY more often with women than men. 

Another example -- A girl will be hanging out with me having a lot of fun during our lunch laughing etc... Then her BF calls to see what she's doing. She wont tell him she's with me, but instead will just sort of avoid letting him know one way or another.

Another personal example -- Girl I'm dating for a few months is routinely texting her guy friends. Not a whole bunch, but she does. Interestingly enough, she never really tells me what they are talking about if I were to ask. I'd get a vague answer. No biggy. What I found interesting is I know she's not that close to that many male friends. I think I've met a total of 2 of them the entire time dating. She sure does have good text relationships with them though. Then later in the relationship she tells me, ""Oh hey, yeah I just got a call from that guy I told you about 2 weeks ago, you know the guy in the same industry?"" I think to myself, ""Yeah I remember that guy, you met him at a party while I was out of town. Why the hell did you give him your number?"" I just got into TRP at the time, so I figured it's just how women are any ways and didn't think to much of it. And honestly, she was texting him ""just as a friend"". I truly believe that when she says that, and I'm sure she did too. But a few months later I ended the relationship because of way too much personal life stress. Guess who she went on a date with just 5 days later? That guy. I'm sure she never planned on fucking him, but it's the female version of spinning plates -- always keeping options around. And in some cases, if she knows the other option is better than her current BF and she is certain that he is absolutely willing to commit, she'll branch swing on over to him. "

While we were talking, I walked inside real quick to go to the bathroom. When I came out, he was gone. Didn't say goodbye, didn't get my number, or anything. I was so confused. I was so used to getting what I wanted, and this feeling of rejection was pretty sucky. I have always been a woman who KNOWS what she wants, and this was not over. 

The next day, I asked a mutual friend of ours for his number. I also remembered him saying the night prior that he worked at the gym. I decided to do what any other determined person would do.

I got all dressed up cute, and drove to the gym ""to ask about pricing for a membership."" There he was! Right at the front! We talked there, and he even called me out saying that I had just gone there to see him. I of course denied it and did we both did the whole flirty thing back and forth for the next couple hours.

Long story short, we ended up going on a date the next day, talked ALL night, had sex, and have been inseparable ever since. I had never felt love for someone so quickly. I moved in with him a month later, and we got married 10 months after that.

hexagram,short,1390707686.0,"I understand your viewpoint OP, but I really, really disagree with you boiling this down to breaking up with him ""because he was short"" (even if only partially) if you truly had no problem with it. You broke up with him because he had personality/character issues that you grew tired of, not because of his height.

Also, I agree completely that this situation was not conductive to a healthy relationship, but his insecurity wasn't ""BS"" if he was surrounded by shitty people, especially his mother, constantly underselling him because of it, as you say. He can't be absolved from all blame (he's a grown man, after all), but instead of putting it all on him, i.e. letting ""his BS insecurity get in his way"", you should ALSO be careful to take issue with the people that beat him down so if his situation is truly as described. That's such a shitty hand to be dealt -- I'm sure we've all had terrible people in our lives, and it's certainly our responsibility to learn how to deal with them and the problems they cause, but I'm so grateful that my mom was mostly supportive of my height (even though she was inconsistent when I was younger) and that most of my other family and friends have been too... or at least not directly damaging about it. I can't imagine if things had been otherwise.

Things like this take time to deal with, whether it has to do with your height or any other feature one grows insecure about due to external pressure. So while it doesn't make him any better suited to be your boyfriend... a little empathy (after the break up) won't hurt. His issues obviously went deep enough that you couldn't fix them, and not for lack of effort. And that's really sad.

Again, it's his duty to work through these things and you can't be expected to help him more than you have (I think your effort has been admirable and hopefully won't go forgotten on his journey to finally accepting himself), I just take issue with the way you've dissected this problem and laid it out to us here. I mean... I'm sure even he knew insecurity was unattractive, but that didn't change him any, did it?"

javatimes,ftm,1390707689.0,"I'm a little afraid this discussion might get out of hand, so let's...try not to get out of hand.

One thing I think that should be stressed first thing is:
trans women's and trans men's experiences are not necessarily mirror images of each other.  I think it's completely possible that a trans woman may have had little to no male privilege, and i also think a trans man could have dealt with a lot of misogynist bullshit in life. Those two experiences do not cancel each other out.

I find discussions of privilege on the internet often go extremely poorly because people tend to think in the individual for themselves, yet don't necessarily extend that thinking to other people. But we clearly all have individual and systemic things both going on and affecting us.

I also think trans people as a whole really complicate discussions of privilege, especially regarding socialization and similar. One sized fits all constructs don't really fit us.  

I also don't think that a lack of personal experience with misogyny necessarily means one got male privilege at the time. I find it hard to isolate any experiences of sexism I had pre-transition. I actually used to be really skeptical of feminism pre-transition because I just had so little experience where misogyny recognizably held me back. But I don't think I had 'male' privilege at the time either. Since transitioning, I see much more what male privilege is, and I am much more feminist now too."

Another way is to dampen your brush first and then dip into your eyeshadow, but you have to be careful which shadow you use in this method. Loose pigment or glittery/frosty shadow is fine but applying water to matte shadow will change the formula. They tend to get a hard...skin? on top, which is why the first method works well. Pick up matte shadow, spray, apply to lid. 

Some people will designate one side of an eyeshadow pan to be their 'wet' side and the other is the dry side. That way if they're going straight in with a damp brush, at least one side will not be affected for dry application. "

goundo,AppalachianTrail,1390707886.0,"This question is really dependent on when you are hiking. If you are going tomorrow, I'm assuming it is balls-cold in Maryland. If you are going in April, it will likely be significantly less balls-cold, and possibly a bit more rainy.

Regardless of time of year, though, some gear will remain pretty consistent. The big 4: Shelter (tent), Sleeping insulation (sleeping bag), Sleeping pad, and Backpack. Hopefully you have those pretty figured out and appropriate to the situation.

If you might be cold, you will want warmth (no cotton hoodies or jeans: if they get wet, they stay wet - and cold). Wool or synthetic fleeces are good, as are puffy jackets, if you can keep them dry. 

If you might get wet, you will want to get dry. Unless you are going mid-july, bring some kind of rain gear, and something to keep the rain off your head at night (you can never count on the shelters to have space - scout troops happen).

Your cookset doesn't need to be anymore than a stove, a pot, and a spoon each. Remember: family is when everyone double dips, and nobody gets sick.

Honestly, your post is a bit vague. I could type for the next 5 hours dispersing random hiking tips that will be useful in exactly 3 situations, but that is way too much typing. A few questions that might help me out:
   
When are you going? Now? In a month? A year from now?  

Where are you going? The AT in MD is only 30-something miles. Unless you all plan on being drunk and stoned off your asses the whole time, that is definitely below a week's worth of miles. Not to insist on pushing big miles all the time, but people do the AT in MD in a day pretty regularly. So where are you starting? Where are you ending, if you are ending at a particular place at all? How many miles do you expect to go per day?

Where are you already, gear and knowledge wise? What gear do you already own, and what were you thinking of bringing on this trip? Are you eying any new gear at the shop? What is it, and why do you think you want it? How much money are you willing to spend on gear?

What kind of physical shape are you in, and how old are you?

Answer these questions, and we can probably help you out a little more. 

Oh, and welcome to the hiking community!"

bluepandadog,bdsm,1390708057.0,"Hm, for me, the first time I noticed how I enjoy being submissive was when I thought the only way I would be able to have sex was if I was raped, due to my religion only allowing sex for purely reproduction and I not wanting children. I was beginning to accept this and eventually I started finding that rape fantasies turned me on. I thought this was rather terrible of me until I learnt of BDSM, and then it clicked. I realized enjoyed being dominated, not raped. It was then that I really developed my enjoyment of bondage and submission.

While I typically was one to prefer submission over conflict before that discovery, I wouldn't consider myself submissive. When I was even younger (toddler - 2nd grade) I was even rather bossy. Then again even now I am only submissive in the bedroom... Anyways, it is hard to tell whether or not I have always enjoyed being submissive before the discovery, because I found out how much I liked it around 5th grade, when I first started toying with sexual fantasies, so before then, I didn't really have anything else I thought about.

Sorry if I am not making much sense, also sorry this was rather long. I guess what I am trying to say is, I am pretty sure I developed my 'kinkiness' rather than it has always been with me, but it is hard to tell. As far as my entire life where I have been interested in sexual things, save for a couple of months or so where I was unsure of what I liked, and first started exploring my tastes and preferences, I have always been interested in bondage and the like, and always have been submissive."

I was only on there for like a month, after about a week of trying to let guys down nicely and them getting all butthurt about it, my policy was this:

* I blocked them if they sent me something creepy.
* Blocked them if I wasn't interested, didn't reply, and then got messages asking why I wasn't replying.
* Didn't reply if they couldn't formulate a message with any meaning or had serious grammar/spelling issues.
* Didn't reply if I checked their Q&amp;A thingy and they gave certain answers to questions I cared about.
* Replied only if they sent a decent message, I liked their profile and they didn't clash with me on the questions.

Zombies don't feel emotions. They're literally just vehicles controlled by a virus to facilitate infection.

&gt;their success depends on...: sheer numbers

Again, not true. While it does partly depend on numbers, their main strength is lack of self-preservation. If you shoot a zombie anywhere but its brain (which, even if you do, does not guarantee instant death; brains are relatively large and the virus would only need to conceivably control a few portions of it), it won't react. You would have to turn its brain into mush to ensure it won't get back up and continue after you.

A lot of people think that being sex positive is being an advocate for promiscuity. That isn't the case...a sex positive person does not promote any specific type of sexual behavior over another.

What I *have* done is stop chatting with *many* guys. Typically, it's just that they say something and I don't have anything I really want to say in response, and instead of finding a way to keep conversation going I don't reply. If they send me another message that I have something to say in reply to, I do, but almost nobody does that. I wonder if they think I ""vanished"" when really I'd be happy to keep chatting if we found more to talk about.

So I guess what I'm saying is, make sure you send one extra follow-up PM if you don't already do that, and if you think I ditched you, let me know."

I don't consider IBT as useful for anything beyond thermal testing (i.e. seeing how well your heatsink copes with unrealistic amounts of heat).

2) Run this program, [BlueScreenView](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html), to look at your BSODs - an excellent way to track and look for patterns in your BSOD codes.

3) Also consider bad-r0bot's point as well.
I don't have a necessarily positive view of G.Skill, despite having an ok with their Ripjaw set previously haha. In my experience, they are binned a bit too tightly for my liking and there is a good chance that a slight adjustment to the timings may be all that's needed. And overall on Haswell, you still generally want to raise clocks instead of having super-tight timings. I'm running fairly loose 2133 at cas 10, for example, because I don't want it restricting my overclock. An OC at 2400 or higher will definitely start impeding your core clock headroom :p

So for the moment, let's try running your kits at 1600cas9. This is a VERY conservative timing. If you can pass all stability tests, then it's more a binning question haha. OTOH, if it still fails at looser timings, then it's something that needs to be addressed. But either way, you have this additional knowledge to use."

This has made a drastic difference for me. It sucks sometimes because I can't stay out and do fun things, but I can't do fun things if I have a migraine anyway.

Exercising so that I can sleep better helped for me. I used to get exercise-induced migraines (and still do, if I get too hot), but gradually building up my stamina and endurance has helped with this.

I quit eating gluten (I know it's bandwagony, but I have legitimate health issues with it) a couple of years back, and that helped with my ability to sleep, which helped reduce migraine frequency and severity for me.

Drinking more water during the day (trying for at least 3 litres).

Cutting out sugar, processed foods, and alcohol.

I'm not migraine-free, but this has helped to take me from several crippling migraines per week to only a few largely manageable ones per month."

papermageling,MakeupAddiction,1390708660.0,"Wet and Wild eyeshadow is *amazing* for the price. It doesn't have the same luxuriousness to it that say, Lorac has, but it gets great results. NYX HD primer is easily better than Urban Decay Primer Potion. Elf studio line has great blushes (both cream and powder). Rimmel and Revlon have great lipsticks. Maybelline has great mascaras (although my HG is Boots No7 Exceptional Definition). Elf cream eyeliner is great. Elf Studio line brushes are good, as are Sonia Kashuk ones (and they come in cute sets!)

Foundation is trickier, because it depends on your shade, skin type, etc. I'd definitely recommend Meow Cosmetics if you want to try out mineral makeup (it has an amazing range, and works more nicely than any other I've used). Revlon Colorstay foundation is great if it works for your color, and Neutrogena Healthy Skin is supposed to be good too.

Basically the gist of it is that because men are (on average) much physically stronger than women, it can be very frightening to be jeered at by strangers. Essentially the male is saying (in an unwanted, unsolicited, rude, invasive way) that he wants her sexually. She then faces the reality that if he wanted to, he could attempt to and possibly succeed at assaulting her. This in and of itself might not be so intimidating, but coupled with the rape culture we live in, that sort of rude, uninvited, forceful commentary on a female's appearance can be quite scary."

Without knowing much about what you want to do or who you are, it's hard to say. Be flexible. Be willing to deviate from your plan.

Are you traveling alone or with friends? Either way, sometimes you'll meet people you might like to tag along with, or who want to tag along with you. Keep travel plans flexible.

Plus if you can be part of some people you trust (ie you've known them for let's say two days), you can look after each other in the hostels.

Another really good set of blades that are very similar to Mizuno is Titleist's version. I have hit them a few times on demos and they feel really good. I think they are the same price as Mizuno.

You need to tell Lilly that you love her. You know you do - Mother and child - but you know it'll be hard if you do what you told me about. You need to show up to school. Don't let Lilly wake up to a dead Momma. As certain as I know, you took *your* Momma's knife that one time you was so afraid. Lilly shouldn't have to be afraid.

No. I can read it slowly, but except for certain words that I know from services or hearing my inlaws speak, I don't understand it.

&gt;Do you keep Kosher?

No. I am at the ""actively only buying foods with hechschers (that Conservative says needs one)"" stage -so ""ingredient kosher"". My husband's favorite food is shrimp, though, so I can't just unilaterally say, ""hey, we're keeping kosher, yo."" 

&gt;Do you walk or drive to Shabbat services?

Drive. My synagogue is in another city at the moment.  When we buy our home in the next few years, I want to be within walking distance. Preferably in an eruv. Preferably in an area where other Jews of lots of different persuasions live.

&gt;Do you lay Tefillin?

I will as soon as they arrive! Been two weeks already hrmph.

&gt;What made you choose conservative over Reform, and Orthodox?

I started in Reform communities (four over five years) and really hated how little they cared about Judaism itself; being with them felt like many Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, and other liberal religious groups I'd known.

I don't believe everything that is required to be Orthodox. 

Hence, I'm in the middle.

I fulfilled the letter but not spirit of the mission by temporarily moving some militia from another settlement to the site to technically complete the mission. The Council of Nobles responded in kind by fulfilled the letter of their promised reward in the form of two units of peasants.

Okay, in reality, it was all probably a coincidence that the Noble Council's half-assed reward corresponded to my half-assed fulfillment of the mission, but nonetheless it felt satisfying from a narrative perspective that their reward was proportional to my completion of the mission: i.e., nominal and half-assed. Although I was mad for a few seconds."
niramu,wemetonline,1390708923.0,"My boyfriend and I were together for 6 months before we met each other in person. We started dating on May 19th, 2013 and I didn't meet him in person for the first time until November 23rd, 2013. I was worried about him not liking me when we met in person too, but that was hardly the case. We both fell in love all over again and twice as hard when he picked me up from the airport and I felt extremely silly for worrying about it so much. Him and I talked for hours every day and fell sleep on Skype together every night (he is actually sleeping on Skype right now), so realistically there is was nothing to be worried about.

I don't think it's mandatory for you to give a gift. I never gave one to my boyfriend when we first met. Me coming to visit was a gift to ourselves from ourselves since we split the cost of the ticket. It was his birthday when I was visiting though so I got him some gifts for that, but I never got him anything strictly because I was meeting him for the first time."

Firehead94,feedthebeast,1390709024.0,"Personally, my hope is that Curse will remain Curse, Forge remains Forge and FTB remains FTB. I would love to see this ""triumvirate"" as a means of establishing proper channels of communication between the 3 to best benefit both the developers and the end users. Combining all 3 into a single entity or conglomeration could prove disastrous as this could lead to arguments over who has final say over what. Im not saying anything will happen but when the possibility is left open, more often than not, it does. You merge the 3 and one could get on their high horse and try and have the end all, be all say in everything. This could be what features mods can/can not have (not counting malicious code ofc), what types of mods can be part of a pack and which cant, whose mods get easy distribution and whose don't. There needs to be checks and balances between the 3, FTB and curse wont distribute mods that are coded to purposefully not work together, curse and devs wont allow modpacks to be distributed that contain ""in-dev"" material that could break servers, and devs and FTB wont put up with copied material or other taboo modding practices to be distributed through curse. If the balance is maintained, kinks can be worked out along the way (if you didnt pick up on it, im including mod-devs and forge in the same category as forge is the base for the majority of mods).


I also noticed from another post the issue of ""copying"" another persons mod. There needs to be a clear and defined line of what is copying and what is improving. I remember reading somewhere on either Technic or FTB forums that being a good mod maker doesnt mean you have a unique idea, its that you have a better idea. Whether thats taking the item transportation of Buildcraft and making something better (i.e. tubes, tubes++, Thermal Expansion, redpower, most other big name, standalone mods) or making something completely new like the Hats mod (or basically any of ichun's mods). Im sure when Thermal Expansion was released, some called it an ic2 knock off (dont quote me on that, just making an educated guess). If a group got together at that point and decided that thermal expansion was not going to be allowed in modpacks or hosted through, &lt;insert mod discussion forum here&gt;, ever because a vocal minority saw it as a copy, it wouldn't be where it is now. Having that clear line drawn will both create an open environment for lesser known mod devs to share some great ideas while mostly getting rid of knock off mods that can clutter a modding subforum."

On more than one occasion, I've seen people both in trp and tbp conflating:

- immorality vs amorality
- discussion of strategy vs actually acting on those strategies

Besides that, we haven't clearly defined what morality we're referring to. For a lot of people, morality is just whatever makes them feel good. But by deontological moral standards, feelings are neither the fuel nor the goal.

No honest discussion can take place in such ambiguity and confusion.

&gt; must think everything is amoral.

Maybe they do. Machiavellianism, dark triad, Nietzsche, sociopathy are worshipped by some.

But there is something to be said for Machiavellian ""pragmatic morality"" for people breaking out of that ""nice guy"" phase and hating on it.

The weightlifting one (which you refer to in your original post) takes place in the muscle and in the motor neurons connecting your muscles to your nervous system. Your new muscle cells that you got from lifting originally start to shrink but don't go away, and your motor neurons have more difficulty recruiting the muscle fibers to actually do the work they're supposed to. The former aspect primarily affects size gains (although cross-sectional area also helps with strength) while the latter primarily affects strength.

If Melo takes his player option, and the roster stays pretty much the same for next season, then the payroll drops to about $12,000,000 before the 15/16 season. Say Melo resigns for the same amount of his current contract (we'll just call it $20,000,000 million). The payroll would then only be roughly $33,000,000. That leaves a lot of room to sign players and build a completely different team ala the Miami Heat. I'm not saying it's gonna happen, but waiting out one more mediocre season is the only situation for Melo to stay on the Knicks and possibly be a part of a championship caliber team."
wotmate,videos,1390709727.0,"&gt;it'd be an interesting project but i doubt anyone will push for it anywhere, it's a much too delicate subject (and quite expensive from the looks of it, money is everything after all) and like ilinizas said, it's hard to balance between the punishment that breaking laws should entail and remaining humane enough to keep these people who make bad decisions sane.

I'm not so sure that the ongoing costs of something like this would be any greater than a normal prison.  If anything, it could well be cheaper (after all, apart from the guards, no outside contractors are required, as the inmates do everything).

Where it would all fall apart, I think, is simply BECAUSE of human rights.  The peace is kept and everybody does their part in that prison because the punishment for not doing so is brutal.  There is no way that a government-run prison would be able to do that.  Just imagine the outcry if a prison guard shot some guys little finger off if he refused to do his part one day.

I don't think that the venezuelan prison is ever going to rehabilitate anyone, and it's not much of a punishment. But the western worlds approach isn't really working either, because they all just continue their life inside."

tomanonimos,AskReddit,1390709763.0,"In simple terms, the freedom. You can do anything you want to do, whenever you feel like it, and how you want to do it. If you are taken you have to take into account your girlfriends schedule and personality. i.e: ""You want to go bowling with you friends but your girlfriend wants to spend some quality time with you; which do you choose?"". If you were single that would not happen. 

Another good thing about being single is the amount of money you save.   You will only be spending money on yourself when you go out to eat and not be paying for your significant other. You wont feel obligated to buy gifts or pay for your significant other. When holidays come, more than likely either you get gifts or you treat it as a regular day, but if you have a girlfriend you have to buy her a gift and hang out with her.   

The only best thing about being a girl and single, that I know for a fact, is that you won't get hurt emotionally when you break up. Other things, I cant be certain of since I only hear it from my friends, are girls wont have to worry about how they look, if their boyfriend is cheating on them, and if my boyfriend is losing interest in me.

KillerHurdz,investing,1390709774.0,"I'm actually long AMD with a price target of $4.80 by Q3.

They've been working to diversify their product portfolio away from big-core CPUs -- the very thing that got them into this mess in the first place. The semi-custom side of the business will keep them going for a little while but anyone playing them long solely on that reason should probably re-think their investing strategy.

Compare and contrast their strategy with a company like Yahoo. Yahoo has been all over the place with their messaging, market strategy, and execution plan. AMD, by contrast, has a clear goal of moving towards growing market segments and away from those that are trending to zero.

They will have grown their market share in notebook graphics by H2 2014 and both Beema and Mullins will be putting significant pressure on the low-end markets that Intel has held for so long.

Q1 is historically a soft quarter for them and this recent sell-off will be short lived, just like last quarter. My Q4 2014 price target was $4.50. It came earlier than I expected in July, dropped, and hit it again in January. My estimates for this year are based on all of what the market knows, with enough research to establish an 18 month outlook on both market performance and the company's output.

It's relatively easy to keep yourself informed and ahead of the market, if you're willing to commit the time to do it. Knowing what's going to happen 12-18 months (24 if you include the consoles) ahead of the market is extremely powerful and can yield amazing results to one's bottom line."

They might also argue that humans were created with curiosity and the potential to learn to fix problems and understand the complexities of the world, therefore writing these things in a text wouldn't be necessary.

Again, the truth is that the Bible was written over the course of 2000 years by people with varying backgrounds and culture, one of the things they all had in common was their lack of knowledge of the universe. It would be kind of ridiculous to expect scientific truths in the Bible unless it really was the result of divine intervention in the lives of its authors.

a4bh3,AskHistorians,1390709992.0,"Essentially with the rise of the German research university model. Humboldt University of Berlin was founded in 1810 and while a good portion of its curricula was still founded on the classics, law, philosophy, medicine, and theology, the sciences all of a sudden had a place at the table. In the United States, schools like RPI and Johns Hopkins were established based on this similar model. At the same time, President Charles Eliot steered Harvard to a more research oriented university. Why was this happening, though? 

For centuries prior, there had been growing resistance to the dominant mode of scholasticism, a type of education built on dialectical reasoning based on Classical Greek and Roman thinkers and works. Peter Ramus in the 16th century was perhaps the most vigorous critic of scholasticism. He was actually thrown out of the university of Paris as a graduate student for criticizing scholasticism and his dismissive attitude to classical thinkers before being readmitted and finishing once a friendlier administration came to power. Thinkers like Francis Bacon were trumpeting ""The New Instrument"" (science), a play on Aristotle's Organon (his method of knowledge production).

Things came a head during the 18th century Enlightenment. Like many sectors of Europe, education was at a crisis. With Christianity being unmoored as the transcendent anchor upon which knowledge was established, Western thought needed a new base. Science was beginning to demonstrate its potential. Advanced math, calculus, blood circulation and new medicine, breakthroughs in optics and physics, and the beginnings of chemistry were astonishing. Biology and plate tectonics were also in their infancy. Darwin was just around the corner.

Ultimately, education isn't a part of a vacuum. Society and culture changed which caused education to change, and education changed which caused society and culture to change.

Previous notions of the educational system relied on either learning skills to be employed and/or a grounding in an education that would demonstrate your ability to be a part of the ruling class (knowing French, Latin, the Bible, Plato, etc.). With the rise of research oriented universities, creating new knowledge became a more fashionable goal of education. This is not to say the other educational modes have died out, but it's a reason why learning the classics has largely died out.

It took me years to find a nice one where I felt comfortable and like he wasn't judging me for my hypochondria.  If you have serious concerns, talk to a doctor about them.  Anxiety can cause a lot of symptoms, but most of those symptoms can be caused by other things as well.  If you have anything that's severe or really persistent and you can see a doctor without too much trouble, do so.  Tell your doctor that you're having problems with anxiety and hypochondria.  Take a list of every ache, pain, twinge, mole, whatever's been bothering you.  That way you don't walk out and suddenly realize that you only asked him about four of your seven cases of self-diagnosed cancer.

I try to think of my body in terms of a car on the road.  Cars make noise as they drive.  Not every noise is a problem.  Same with your body.  I've freaked myself out over symptoms that disappeared when I changed my pillow.  Keep in mind that anxiety can be unhealthy, and that one of the best things you can do for your overall health is to try to stop worrying.  Not completely, because if you're like me that's impossible.  But when you're sitting there freaking out over some pain somewhere, focus on calming down about it.  Make a conscious effort to let it go, and then go distract yourself.  Looking up stuff online makes it worse."

So, I signal boost and I will certainly make some comments, but I try not to center myself and not to take up too much space. And I try to talk about male privilege non-pretentiously with other men.

on the other hand...

a relationship can be a trigger, in a certain way, for depressive thoughts. it can make you feel as though you're letting your SO down, like you're a burden to them. like you need to hide from them and act like everything is okay. you will inevitably lash out at them, or be too down to have fun with them, or somehow or another your depression will affect them in some way. and that can hurt a lot, especially if you care a lot about them.

fnredditacct,CrohnsDisease,1390710178.0,"I went from my father's insurance to my husband's (also BCBS) when we got married.

It is my understanding that, in the US, it now illegal for coverage to be denied in this case. But also that it's up to the employer's HR department. To be sure, talk to someone in HR and get their word that she will be *immediately* covered, get it in writing, just in case.

You should also compare the specific coverage (just in case yours sucks or her tuition is really cheap), here are the things to look at:

(1) The premium: This comes out of your paycheck every month. It **will** go up (from whatever you pay now) when you add a spouse. It *might* go up a lot since she has a preexisting condition. I'm unsure about the current legality on this. Ask your HR department. Get it in writing.

(2) Co-pays: This is what you pay at the doctor's office per visit, every time. There are different co-pays for different kinds of appointments: Primary care physicians, Specialists, ER, Urgent Care.

(3) Deductible: This is what you have to pay towards your bills before insurance covers anything. It'll be some hundreds. Maybe 300, maybe 500. Different for different plans and companies. AFTER you've met the deductible, your insurance starts paying a PERCENTAGE of every bill.

(4) Co-insurance: This is the percentage of every bill that YOU have to pay, AFTER you've met the deductible. 

(5) Maximum out of pocket expense: This is the running total of co-insurance that you pay throughout the year (deductible doesn't count). When you hit this number, insurance covers everything EXCEPT copays, which you have to keep paying. Loopholes: make sure there isn't a ""lifetime limit"" on this. 

(6) Prescription costs are different. The do not count towards the out of pocket max. (At least haven't for me on my two different plans.) I haven't entirely figured out drug coverage yet. It seems fluid in a way I don't understand.

So here's an example of how it works:

Every month a few hundred dollars (actually not sure what it is now in the new year) is taken out of my husband's paychecks so that we have insurance. That's the premium.

I just had a colonoscopy/endoscopy a couple weeks ago.

Our plan only has ER copays, no co pay on this procedure. 

There are several different bills associated with this one procedure: physician bill, facility bill, drugs they gave me, something else that hasn't processed yet, some second yet-to-be-processed bill, etc

They're going to total to something close to $4,000. (I think? not yet processed)

Our insurance has a deal with the hospital that they are special and their bills aren't as expensive. So the bill gets knocked down to $3,000. (estimating/rounding.)

I have a $400 deductible. And a coinsurance rate of 25%.

I have to pay 400 before they start paying. So that brings the ""pre percentage"" bill down to $2600. Then they pay 75% and I pay 25%, they pay 1950, I pay 650. So I'll pay something like a total of $1050. (Again, I think, hasn't processed yet.)

I will keep paying 25% of every bill I have this year until I have paid $1500 (not including deductible). So I, at most, will have to pay 450 more, then everything I have done will be free (for me). After I've paid 1500, insurance pays the full amount of every remaining bill. If I had to go to the ER, I would still have to pay my 100 copay. If my specialist copay wasn't $0, I would still have to pay those as well. I still have to keep paying whatever the drug store says I owe on my prescriptions."

sporadically_rabbit,AskReddit,1390710253.0,"If Earth is one-sided, with ""gravity"" acting down, and it is possible for things to fall off the edge (rather than some kind of local ""gravity"" shift at the edge), there would be an exclusion zone around the perimeter on the ground for a fair proportion of the circumference, but many areas bordering poorer countries or areas with less strict OH&amp;S standards would be left.  There would probably be some allowance for civilian tourist flights to go beyond the border, within a certain distance that could presumably be returned from even in the event of accidents (e.g. gliding after engine failure), determined largely by insurance costs. Dumping bodies over the edge in quick flights would be the preferred method of disposal for the mob/drug cartels (assuming they want them to disappear, rather than display them) in areas close enough to the edge.  Photos of the edge from civilian flights, or even from beneath the plane of the Earth from military fly-unders would be used as desktop wallpapers, and fantasy and sci-fi would somewhat commonly use the flip side as a setting for their stories.

If the surface maintained a fairly constant thickness, various properties would be affected by how deep this is, such as (if it were very thin), there may not be sufficient depth for foundations to build skyscrapers, or even at more substantial thicknesses, there may not be a magma layer to create volcanoes, so many island chains might not exist.  

If tectonic activity still occurred somehow, the resulting forces would break the plane of the earth apart (remembering that gravity is working down in this theory, else the Earth would coalesce back into a rough sphere) into fragments.  If there weren't tectonic activity, there would be an absence of large mountain ranges like the Himalayas.

Thinking about it now, there probably would have to be some kind of local gravity shift or other force pushing back at the border, otherwise everything would just end up going over the edge eventually, which if it hadn't happened by the time humans came about, would probably be a pressing concern.  With the edges of the Earth constantly falling off, the perimeter zones would be continuously forming larger slopes, making it even easier for material to fall off. Some of this problem could be fixed if the Earth were, in this situation, of an (for all intents and purposes) infinite thickness, in which case there would be a global interest in terraforming projects to stabilise the perimeter to allow for habitation of the border zones.

With a flat world, there would be no need for different time zones, though day would start a tiny bit earlier for the Eastern side than the Western, with any hills, mountains out other tall structures blocking sound of the light.  This would be true in reverse at sunset however, with the Western edge receiving a little more light.  The seasons of the year would also be synchronised throughout the world, with sunlight striking the entire world at the same angle.  There wouldn't be any kind of equator either, as another result of the above.  This would have an interesting effect on the growth regions of various plants and animal habitats.

On further thought, the ""year"" may actually only be half as long, with a Summer-Winter cycle (if being the measure of a year in early human history), being equivalent to half of an orbit around the sun, the alternative being having two Summer-Winter cycles in a year (do a quick hand model to check for yourself, it just occurred to me as I was writing this post).

There are presumably thousands more things that would be affected, but this is enough for now."

All classes were over with by Noon Tuesday-Friday, had to be at the Stadium by 1 PM. If I wasn't in class I had a list of 10 players that that I had to make sure were in their class. Didn't get to my room until 10pm every night.   
Monday was  when our labs were scheduled. Had to be at the Stadium by 6 pm. Didn't see my room until midnight.  

&gt;Is there a better job for a college student working for the football team?  

Hmm, it was $90 a week + all the food I wanted. (my god the food ).  

Friday night's were spent putting new decals on all the Helmets. The first game we didn't end with this task until 3 AM.  By the bowl game we had cut the time down to an hour :)  

We arrived at school in the middle of July to unpack all the new gear.  scrubbed the locker rooms from top to bottom.   
When the players arrived for practice in August it was the Freshman Managers and Trainers job to wake up all the players for the first practice in the morning and then again for afternoon practice. ( 2 a days still used, for the month of August ? ) So, while the players got all the rest they needed, we slept about 5 hours a day if lucky.  

This was the 80's in the SWC (southwest conference ). All conference games  were in the State of Texas except for Arkansas.  For the away games we would pack all the gear into Trucks and drive the gear to whatever town we needed to be in.  Sometimes not getting into town until 3-4 am. Where we had to unpack the trucks and put the gear into lockers. If the game was at noon, this really sucked. we would be awake for 36 hours+ a lot.  

&gt; Any respect from the players and coaching staff.  
  
coaching staff didn't know we existed until we weren't there.  
The Players treated us very well because we could fok their life if we wanted to.  (remember the part about checking to see if they were in class or not ).  

With all this said. I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. Game day's were awesome. I have received super bowl tickets and other perks throughout my life because of this job.

ibbity,relationships,1390710480.0,"Let me ask you this. If you found out that your girlfriend was thinking ""I'm a hot woman and I'm good in bed, I deserve to go out and sleep with as many hot guys from the club as I can pick up before (ugh) settling down to be stuck with my boyfriend for the rest of my life,"" how would you feel? Now, obviously you haven't told her about this, which is good, but if you found out that she was thinking like that, would you believe that she was really willing to commit to you for marriage, or would you start having second thoughts? Because you don't sound like a man who's willing to commit for life. You sound like a man who for some reason feels that by finding the love of his life early on, he was somehow *cheated* out of sex with other women. And that is the mindset of a man (same goes for women if they're feeling this way) who, if he doesn't take steps to deal with it NOW, WILL have an affair and break his woman's heart. 

What you need to do is make a decision. Either you end things with your girlfriend (do not make the mistake of thinking you can ""take a break"" to sex up random other women and she will still be there when you get done) or you can come to grips with the fact that you WILL only ever have sex with her for the rest of your life, and deal with it like a grown-ass adult instead of like a kid who thinks he's being deprived of something he's entitled to.

 If you really, really can't handle the idea of lifetime monogamy, BREAK UP. It isn't for everyone and the sooner the better for all concerned. Sooner you leave her, sooner you can get to banging all those ""exotic"" Asian women, and sooner she can get on with finding a man who actually WANTS to be with her and only her.

 If you really, really love her and would rather be with her and her alone forever than lose her, then I'd honestly advise you find some kind of therapist or counselor to help you through it. I'm not at ALL suggesting that you have mental or emotional problems---that's not it. What I'm saying is that this issue isn't going to just vanish overnight even if you try heroically to rid yourself of it. It's going to take time and work, and a counselor can help you a lot. This isn't an uncommon problem for people who are just realizing what a lifetime commitment to one other person really means and entails, I'm sure whoever you find will understand and be able to help you. 

You might also find it helpful to look through this sub and relationship_advice for threads by people who felt the same way you did and didn't know what to do, or who broke up because of that feeling. You're not alone out there, others have struggled with this too. Here's hoping you figure out what you really want in life and are able to take steps to get it."

Currently, this whole transition is in its infancy so it's really hard to say what the tipping point is going to look like, but I think your speculation is as close as one can speculate. I imagine as it evolves, it's going to move closer to a sort of crowd sourced platform. Where the journalists will release their media and the community will rigerously fact check and verify the story with all the tools available to that massive community. The news sources credibility will then hinge on being able to pass the rigorous crowd sourced fact checking. I mean, we are already seeing this now to a lesser degree. Today politicians can't get away with any propaganda at all because soon as they do, the internet tears them a part. I imagine this is going to become more and more common in the future, as well as this form of information being far more popular than it is today. "

Dicearx,jailbreak,1390710805.0,"The ones I know about and have used:

CCLoader

Bigify

NoSlowAnimations

DockShift

HiddenSettings7

Badge Customizer

customLS / Lock Screen Tool

There's a free status customiser too, but I cant think of the name.

The main features I dont know about free versions of are cover flow and hiding the dock. Also, Springtomize is a better solution for some of these free solutions (like resizing icons with bigify), but also less comprehensive than some (like bigify can do icon transparency and Springtomize can not).

I dont know of a free option, Homescreen Designer is pretty great for customising icon layouts, and cheaper than Springtomize. So combine all those tweaks with Homescreem Designer and you basically have Springtomize.

In the hour Ive been dicking around with Springtomize I agree with OP thats its quite disappointing. There are also some oddities/glitches that need to be worked out, IMO.

My concern is your daughter. Like other commenters have mentioned, she's at VERY high risk for an eating disorder. Aren't you worried about her developing anorexia or bulimia? Those disorders are no healthier than obesity. You are giving her a very unhealthy relationship with food, just as unhealthy as yours is. You are teaching her to be so afraid of gaining weight that she can't even have a snack, even as she watches you eat whatever you want. This is going to cause resentment towards you, and like I said she is at VERY high risk for developing an eating disorder. 

People with eating disorders are not comfortable in their own bodies, no more than people who are obese are. This is a horrifying situation. 

I'm not trying to hurt or judge you, but you don't seem to understand what a terrible message you're giving your daughter about food and her own body. Make all the excuses you want about your own behavior, addiction is tough especially when it involves food (which you can't just avoid). But don't go the opposite direction with this girl.

Just wanted to say, I'm pretty sure it is mentioned in the sidebar that we are not supposed to tell anybody they look better without make-up. So when you told her you liked her eyebrows better without the makeup on them, it went against our MUA etiquette. Many of us here offer constructive criticism if we think we can improve her look, but since her brows look flawless she doesn't need any CC (from me at least). so a good rule of thumb for men or anybody else who browses MUA, give the sidebar a read, and keep what you learned in mind when commenting from now on. We MUA are all about makeup, it is a huge part of many of our lives, its a hobby. I love collecting pretty lipstick tubes and fancy packaging. Its way more complicated than ""we do it to attract guys"". we do it as an artistic outlet. We do it because we like collecting pretty things. We do it because we can make ourselves look super sweet one day, the next day look like a pinup, the next day look hardcore and vampy, etc etc. It's a creative outlet, artistic expression. We even enjoy studying the origins and evolution of makeup.Of all the many reasons we have to wear makeup, ""impressing men"" would be at the very bottom of the list.

As for Star Wars, the movies are heresy to the EU fans, everything has been retconned in one way or another, and we can't even have a real discussion between Star Wars tech and other universes since Star Destroyer always wins because the writers chose ridiculously large numbers for the power levels of their tech. Hell, Star Trek has matter replicators and teleportation, but even the borg are discounted since Star Destroyers have magic lasers.

Point being, we're actually able to have a debate using Golden Age Superman(the Superman you mentioned) around here. Star Wars fans have a retcon explanation for everything that happened in the movies and refuse to acknowledge them as source material."

This is the one perspective that really makes me feel hopeful about the future of the field, because it's about diversity, not anatomy.  

For better or worse, and for reasons probably not 100% linked to gender, I often don't look at problems the way my teammates do.  Sometimes the way I look at them is straight-up not as good.  Other times it works out better.  In the best times, my weirdo idea prompts a discussion that leads to the creation of a better solution than any of us could've come up with on our own.

My colleagues put a lot of emphasis on what's ""best"" - the best blogs to read, the best editor to use, etc.  They focus so much on what they have in common and how close they can come to this (mostly shared) idea of what the ideal developer looks like.  For this reason, I try to minimize my own differences to the extent that I can without being fake, but secretly I'm so pumped when people talk about the importance of diversity in the field.  Ultimately, I don't think it's what we have in common that make us a strong team -- I think it's exactly the opposite."

Same thing with immigration. They have a point with saying we should secure our borders and not cater to illegals, they just have a serious message problem when it comes to addressing it where they come off like stubborn racists. 

They have a point about the budget deficit, but use it as a pawn to push their pro rich, small government agenda, using it to justify cuts, but throwing a temper tantrum over minor tax increases. So they seem very insincere about it. It's obvious they use it as a pawn, and don't really care about it. If they cared, they'd raise taxes after Obama offers up all kinds of spending cuts on the table. Because, you know, that's what bipartisan compromise is supposed to look like.

Until the republicans learn civility and compromise, as far as I'm concerned, they can't do anything right, even when they're right. Because even if they're right to some degree, their bat**** craziness just destroys any credibility they have."

* Wash face (exfoliate 1-2x per week at night)
* Use toner (Witch Hazel)
* Apply moisturizer
* Apply all eye/brow makeup while moisturizer sinks into skin (I like to leave the moisturizer for about 10-20 minutes before adding my face makeup)
* Apply face primer, foundation, concealer over top of foundation only where needed, translucent setting powder, bronzer/contour shade if using that day, then blush, use a buffing brush to blend bronzer/blush together. **Note:** I add my setting powder before contour/blush because I have oily skin and this step helps my blush blend better and it shows up more pigmented. I can always add a tiny bit more powder over the blush if necessary.
* Add something on my lips, difficulty level depends on how much time I have.

Regarding the question about concealer over top of foundation, this is usually done because your foundation will often even out your skin tone enough that you can identify a few key areas where you might need concealer. If your skin is fine and you don't prefer to use foundation you can easily just add a bit of concealer where needed and then put your powder over top to set everything.

drummingbooming,ftm,1390711527.0,"i think when it comes to trans people the presence of privilege can be more complicated than in other situations (for example, and i'm white so jab me if i say this wrong, people of color who pass as white and thus occasionally benefit from things related to white privilege, while still being subject to racism)

i guess...societal privilege is largely based upon what you are relative to society. it's not an inherent trait. deconstructing privilege is actually one way to dismantle the idea that the privileged are inherently better, and that is why we/they receive their privilege. i do not think trans men automatically have or benefit from male privilege simply by virtue of being men, when for all intents and purposes, they are perceived as girls and women by the people around them. so no, not from the cradle.

the fact that trans people are often ""presenting"" as their gender online while not even having come out or started presenting as that gender offline complicates this. can trans men on the internet benefit from male privilege, even those who are closeted/not out IRL and present as women? yes, i think so, because in the context of online discussion, they still receive male privilege in certain ways; preferential respect and attention we are subconsciously taught to afford to men, etc.. but by the same token, those men cannot be addressed as though they enjoy all aspects of male privilege, because they are still subject to oppressions related to femaleness offline, where they are not recognized as male. does that make sense? that's my take on it, anyway.

every website culture has its faults, but i think when it comes to tumblr in particular political/social discussions tend to be painted with a broad brush and made into black-or-white issues when things arent quite that clean. like, i would agree that as a baseline all trans womens experiences are womens experiences, but individually, i know people who prefer to think of their pre-transition self as another person, and use different pronouns to refer to them - and so would probably say their experiences were men's experiences, up to a point. there are people on this subreddit from both sides of the whole ""i was always a man""/""i was a girl at one point but i am a man"" schtick, or even other takes on their relationship with their gender before and after transition, you know? that applies everywhere."

balathustrius,mead,1390711605.0,"&gt; After you put some StarSan dilution into the carboy, do you only need to swish it around until all of the carboy is has been touched by it?

Yes. I keep some in a spray bottle for this sort of purpose.

&gt; Do I have to rinse the carboy afterwards?

No. Just dump it; don't fear the foam. It will actually break down into something yeast will eat. (from [The Brewing Networks' Interview of Charley Talley](http://thebrewingnetwork.com/shows/The-Sunday-Session/The-Sunday-Session-03-19-06-Sanitation-w/-Charlie-Talley))

&gt; Will I need rubber gloves to avoid horrible chemical burns?

No. Once it is diluted properly it is so harmless to humans that one can actually drink it. (also from [The Brewing Networks' Interview of Charley Talley](http://thebrewingnetwork.com/shows/The-Sunday-Session/The-Sunday-Session-03-19-06-Sanitation-w/-Charlie-Talley)) But be careful with it in non-diluted form. I pour into a measuring spoon/cup/vessel, then directly into water, so there isn't much to worry about. After it is diluted, I use it to sanitize my hands throughout the process. Edit: It may dry out your hands if you work in it all day.

&gt; On the StarSan bottle, it talks about proper disposal of pesticides, does this mean I can't/shouldn't pour StarSan down the drain?

Drain is fine. See the part about being able to drink it. [From NortherBrewer](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/star-san.html): ""Star San is environmentally friendly, biodegradable, and will not harm septic systems.""

&gt; Is it safe to put it in my kitchen sink or get it anywhere near my sink, or should it be done in a garage or storage room?

When I first started, I mixed up 5 gallons of it in my sink regularly. That meant that, occasionally, my sink was  clean! Again, see part about how you can drink it, once diluted.

&gt; Basically I want to hear detailed explanations of people's sanitation methods. Other than that, I was wondering about airlock fluid, have any of you had any problems with just using regular ol' tap water?

Sometimes this liquid can get sucked back into a carboy due to pressure change. I use vodka. Others use water with preservatives added. Some have no problems with water, but shit 100 proof vodka is cheap. :-)

&gt; Will EC-1118 work in JOAM?

It *will* ferment, alright. EC-1118 has a reputation as something of a monster. JAOM is a weird recipe. Because it does so much ""wrong,"" it can turn out terribly if you change things. In this case, if you change the bread yeast (lower alcohol tolerance) to the EC-1118 (really high tolerance), you'll end up with bitter, dry mead. If you're going to do this, don't use the orange pith. Use just the zest and (if you want) the juice and pulp. It will still turn out dry, but you can always backsweeten, or if you're watching fermentation, cold crash and stabilize when it's the sweetness you want (gravity: 1.010 - 1.030).

Edit: Added some sources, fixed the Brewing Network link - I meant Charley Talley, not Jon Herskovits."

Once the suckage of detox is over and you start to get a sense of normalcy its pretty damn natural to get a little bored. If they offer time for exercise at a gym take it, even if you don't smoke sit outside with the smokers and share war stories, get ahold of a notebook and doodle, write down phone numbers of people you meet and write down whatever emotions come up, its cool to look back later to see how your thinking has changed. I just know from my experience that I gained a lot of weight (boredom + easy access to food) but thats ok, be kind to yourself and just remember your body probably needs a little more to fully heal itself. And even with the best intentions youre gonna want to leave, your disease will scream at you that you could do this easier at home with subs and that these people dont know what theyre doing, but just try and work through those thoughts they will go away eventually.

I've never said he was a dictator, but only because it really depends on the definition, and it's not always a useful and meaningful concept. My only claim was that the CHP rule was authoritarian. Neither ""dictator"" nor ""authoritarian"" are synonymous with ""evil"", and I don't use them that way. They're just descriptions of certain phenomena. No need to get defensive.

&gt;... you continue to sling your mud at Ataturk. I wonder why? Are you perhaps a member of the AKP? Are you religious and angry that Ataturk prevented religious rule and disbanded the Caliphate?

Quite a keen eye. No, I'm agnostic, never voted for AKP, and wouldn't want a Caliphate, thank you.

&gt;What do you gain by attacking Ataturk and the CHP's early rule

My purpose is not to attack but to understand and acknowledge what really happened during that period. I'm interested in minority rights. Things that happened in that period with minorities upsets me. I would like to understand them well, and I would like others to understand them well too, to make sure they don't happen again with what little minorities we have left in the country. If it was a hostile environment for minorities, and we call it minority-friendly (and convince ourselves of that), it becomes harder to recognize hostile environments that are likely to (and do) emerge now."

Megawatts19,AskReddit,1390711976.0,"One of the crossroads I came to during my stint at college went something like this:

I believe in God. There is just to much evidence around me for me to not believe in Him. That said, I loathe religion. I loathe arm chair Christians that go to church every Sunday, but talk about you when you're not there and look down on you because you don't fit their mold of a prototypical Christian. The entire Christian religion is hypocritical. They preach acceptance and to not be judgmental, but they vehemently fight things like homosexuality at every turn.

God didn't create humans to enforce his laws (commandments). Christians should love as examples, not enforcers. Members of the church that go around Bible thumping telling others that they're living their lives incorrectly is the exact opposite what God wants from His followers. We should welcome everyone with open arms regardless of color, creed, affiliation, or personal life. That's the beauty if a faith based relationship.

But, no, Christians spend too much time trying to tell others how to live instead of worrying about themselves, their actions, and their legacy. Live for others. Live full of love. And cultivate a relationship with Jesus. THAT is Christianity. Not this bastardized religion society employs today.

savoytruffle,AskReddit,1390711980.0,"My (old) dad is trying to learn Spanish and doing pretty well at it. He's in his early 60's. He was pretty good at German that he learned in college and spent a semester in West Germany in college in the 1970's.

He has a Berlitz tutorial session once a week in a nearby town that also has homework. He also does Rosetta Stone at home on his iMac, and checks out books from the library. What he relates to me about that is the best books are he best likes children's tutorial books from about the 1960's. But maybe he's just nostalgic for when he was in school.

He admitted it's partially just to seem productive during the day to my mom since he got an early retirement from his last job.

And one day to communicate with his caretakers in the nursing home.

But they're going to Argentina in March, so he'll be tasked very heavily! (it is a guided tour but with free exploration time)

&gt;So why the Decree of Return? What was the point of that...

You mean the decree that had to be issued with pressure from the Allies after the war was lost? Yea, one wonders...

&gt;... Mr. expert historian?

At no point did I claim to be a historian, in fact I explicitly said I was a layperson, and I explained quite clearly that you should deal with historians if you want a proper debate, and that it would be more useful for onlookers as well to see different sources and opposing viewpoints from informed people. That was my initial point, remember?

&gt; Are you a historian ? No? Then why are you debating this with me?

...

&gt;People try to avoid the discussion due to social pressure. There's so many people who believe in the genocide--that those who are questioning it or are not 100% certain, don't want to talk about it, because there is too much massive amounts of information involved.

Just what do you expect people to do when you talk about this in subreddits like IAMA and Turkey? To accept your points and move on? Of course people will counter your points with what they know. If you choose different subreddits, you'll get different crowds. That was the point I was making before you insisted on debating the subject matter with me.

&gt; It is anti-Turkish to vilify a whole group of people for genocide

No one's vilifying whole groups. The claim that some people did something bad does not then mean that all people in that group are bad. If one equates the two claims, be it on the side making the claim or on the side being blamed, it's a fallacy, and nationalism is a typical manifestation of that. Why is this a hard concept to grasp?* 

Even based entirely on your points there were targeted massacres and people who were being taken to court and punished for that. It was the Turks committing the crimes, and the Turks punishing them. One can't look at that scene and conclude that all Turks were innocent or that they were all guilty.

&gt;I'm American, I'm not a nationalist. I don't support the MHP.

You don't have to be Turkish or Armenian (or support MHP) to have nationalist views*. You complain about a group of people (Turks) being blamed unfairly (when that's not even the claim), and then blame all Armenians for all kinds of stuff. I'm quite specific about what I call nationalism -it's the generalizations I just mentioned-, and you do it in every other sentence you write.

*edit: Perhaps I'm not using the right term? I think my descriptions here explain what I'm referring to rather clearly. If there's a better word for that than nationalism, I'll replace it with that. I think sometimes people use the word racism, but I don't like that usage for several reasons (the primary one being that there's no reference to biology/genes here)."

I've used the [Bare Minerals Stroke of Light](http://www.sephora.com/bareminerals-reg-stroke-of-light-trade-eye-brightener-P375287?skuId=1441773) and it's performed just as well and it's almost half the price.

In the English accent, ""tea"" and ""T"" are actually pronounced differently (the letter one is actually called ""a lorry""). Eventually Shakespeare invented a bunch of new words to come up with English II, and half of England started using that version of the language, but there were so many new words that some words had to be merged with other words. Since this was happening in England, they decided to commemorate their favo(u)rite drink, and named the letter it started with after tea.

Eventually, we in America decided to go back to speaking proper, Olde English, but over the 710 years since, a lot of the old words had been forgotten, which is why we never got the old name of T back. Interestingly, while everyone remembers the Boston T Party to protest English II, most historians forget about the Philadelphia Z Party, when that whole city got together to celebrate Ben Franklin publishing the first dictionary that didn't call Z ""Zed""."

Also, first time sex doesn't always hurt.  Have you ever put anything in your vagina while masturbating?  If you have, your hymen could be gone already.  If you haven't, don't think that it's automatically going to equate to pain.  My first time didn't hurt at all, and I didn't bleed.

And then Doge hit 270 and I sold 2/3 of what I mined; netting me $250.  Next day Amazon lists the MSI Gaming 290 for $420 - which I immediately gobbled down like a fat guy at a buffet.

To expand, I already had the GPUs that were capable miners so for me this is virtually all profit as it stands - not to mention I just recently rebuilt this computer.  So once the new GPU arrives (the 290 that AMAZON neglected to show was already backordered when I bought it) I'm taking the parts  I yanked out, spending $60 or so to finish off what is needed to get it up (""case"", PSU,) then setting it up and letting it run 24/7.  800kh/s miner and a new computer is not a bad set up to me."

As an adult, I love tickles. I used to get my best friend to pin me down and tickle me. No matter how much I flailed, pleaded, and screamed, I still wanted more. She’d go until she ran out of energy (even with me encouraging her by threatening to tickle her if she stopped). Good times.

1. A couple years ago, my mom and I were discussing tickling and she mentioned that one of my uncles had tried to tickle me when I was eight or so.

SpazMonkeyBeck,AdviceAnimals,1390712903.0,"I was an ice skater when I was a kid and when I was 11, I was practicing a jump (single axel) and had to swerve at the last second to avoid a collision, I landed wrong and hit the ice HARD. My coach was more concerned than my father, who told me to stop being such a baby and do it again. I could barely skate, walking wasn't happening, so the coach carried me off the ice and my father took me home. Only after a solid 6 hours of me complaining about the pain was I taken to have an X-ray, because my mum gave in and backed me up because I never complained this much about pain before,  sure enough, my leg was broken and my father had wanted me to land an axel on it, it would have splintered."

shytemptation,SubredditDrama,1390712972.0,"Car accidents don't generally come with intent. They may be more gruesome but that isn't as mentally upsetting as seeing a room full of dead kids and knowing some sicko out there actually had the desire to kill children for no good reason and held the desire long enough to actually plan for it and carry it out. It's one thing when adults are killing one another over petty crap or for a kid's life to get cut short in an unfortunate accident but it's a whole different realm when you've got kids in school doing what society has deemed best for them and not causing any trouble and suddenly they are getting deliberately and violently killed. Anyone with a decent sense of empathy is going to be baffled and bothered by the thought that there are people out there who have no empathy and could hate a harmless classroom of small children. I doubt there is any sort of training that could really prevent people from being affected by seeing something that extreme firsthand.

Also, just because the one person was out because he couldn't handle it doesn't necessarily mean that all the other cops who ""couldn't handle it"" were distraught to the point of being unable to carry out their duties. Some of them might be included who are having trouble coping with it and have added stress or depression in their lives and maybe have recurring nightmares, but not to the point where they can't carry out their day to day duties.

I was diagnosed with PTSD in high school after going through a long period of sexual abuse by a family member, but I still made decent grades in most of my classes and still had friends. I had a lot of stress and upheaval in my life but that didn't stop me from keeping some aspects of my life together in spite of the rough times. Mental illness/trauma isn't a toggle from 100% functional to 100% incapacitated in life, it's more of a sliding scale of severity and doesn't affect all aspects of life equally."

I make educated guesses based on temperature, yeast, past experiences, and OG about when the gravity will be in the range that I want to cold crash.

Even if he doesn't understand your feelings on this he should at least respect them. I mean how hard is it to not say a girl you fucked previously is attractive? You aren't asking him to never look at women. You aren't asking him to pretend to only find you beautiful. You aren't actually asking *that much* of him. 

It sucks that he tells you that you're being crazy. Most girls (hell, most people even!) don't want to hear about how attractive their boyfriends past hookup is.

puaSenator,PurplePillDebate,1390713723.0,"I wouldn't say low self esteem at all. Generally this behavior comes from the more attractive chicks that are able to exercise their options -- they also know how attractive they are and what type of man they can get. I know you don't really agree on what a lot of TRP says, but I think the problem is you just haven't seen it from our perspective. You're not trying to date women after all so a lot of these neuences just aren't apparent to you.  You personally may say, ""No that's not true, I'M not like that."" But what if I were to ask you, ""Okay, well then do you KNOW any women like that?"" I bet then you would say yes and name off quite a few chicks you know like this. And these are just the ones you publicly know about. Most chicks are fantastic at keeping this type of stuff really secret and nonchalant. 

Interestingly enough, this is why guys like Ugly Ducklings so much. They weren't attractive when they were in their younger years, so they had to focus on their personality to get by. They also never really made rampant hypergamy part of her character, because she was so used to not getting tons of men when she was younger, she sort of was greatful for whomever would date her. When they get older, they then get hot, but still have loyal and honest values. I know it's fucked up to say, but the slight amount of insecurity the Ugly Duckling has is also their strength. They are so used to not being high value, that they appreciate their new status. They don't recognize that they are now super banging and can sleep with whomever they please, but instead don't see that side as a possible reality. 

But at the same time, ugly ducklings can just as easily grow up into whores. Because they spent their youth never getting male attention (usually by being overweight), but grow up, lose the weight, and become attractive. They then now LOVE all the new male attention they are getting and go way overboard. I knew a chick in HS that was a little chubby, and was sort of always one of the guys.

sarcasmplease,AskWomen,1390713741.0,"I think you need to start doing things that make you feel good about yourself.  You say you are successful.  Is there someone at your work place that needs mentoring?  You could mentor them.  It will make you feel good helping them and might even get you noticed by your higher ups.  You could do volunteer work.  It will make you feel good and you might even make some new friends. 

I think you have been attracting the wrong kinds of guys because you don't love or appreciate yourself.  And do you continue to date them even though they don't treat you well so you won't be alone?  Try being without a boyfriend for a while to work on getting yourself better.

I don't know how you feel about pets but have you considered adopting a cat from a shelter?  You have love to give and it would be a worthy recipient of that love.  It would probably help you to feel less alone, too.  I wish you all the best.

kiwirish,hockey,1390713826.0,"As a New Zealander, hockey is doing alright here at the moment, it's getting bigger but the fact that you can go to the beach 12 months a year in the North where 75% of the population lives makes it difficult for people to even acknowledge hockey as a sport. 

Then comes costs, $600/year to play, plus about $1000 for startup gear and $350/hr for team practices, it just adds up. I can play rugby for $80/year and buy new boots for $100 every 5-6 years. I can play field hockey for $300/year and have a stick last years. It's just top expensive for Kiwis to get into it. Having only 5 rinks in the whole country doesn't help either. 

If we were to get a franchise league like the NBL across Australia and New Zealand, with paid players we could maybe grow the game in crazy numbers quickly. The MLB owns the ABL and now the MLB is playing regular season games in Australia this year. If the NHL owned a league in the southern hemisphere the same things could happen.

I LOVE IT

It helps that reddit provides an enormous HTML structure on which I can play, whereas my own project requires me to build HTML and JavaScript on my own and while working with all three is awesome and I can do stuff I can't on reddit because we're not allowed anything beyond somewhat-formatted text in posts (even the wiki, which is disheartening. I had plans for that).

But yeah. Other than the war between big-sub moderators and RES, and some occasionally (technical term) WEIRD AS HELL structures, playing here is terrific.

____

Followup: I've made a lot of convoluted hacks that would have been entirely unnecessary with greater access (like the banner image is now a link; if I could have HTML, I'd have just wrapped the `div#header-bottom-left` block in a link, but since I don't, I wound up removing the image from the usual place and putting it in `span` element and blowing that up to full-size) so I think that's actually overall a good thing for me, since I'm forced to be more flexible and creative in my approach to working with the design.

Though I would KILL to be given some more structural access, such as choosing where the front-page link goes (hot, **new**, top, etc). "
WeaklyDominant,changemyview,1390713851.0,"The question of whether to immigrate really depends on where you are immigrating from, what your relevant other options are, and what opportunities you will have to succeed once you get here.

For some people, the US is a goldmine waiting to happen. If you happen to be toward the top of a white-collar profession/something that requires a fairly developed or technical economy, you are unlikely to find a place better than the US for your job (e.g. a lawyer's compensation, or the compensation for a CEO). Needless to say, money is not everything, but if you have certain high-ceiling opportunities available to you, the ceiling is likely to be higher in the US than elsewhere. Clearly that is not the case for all (or most) people, but it does mean that now isn't necessarily a bad time to immigrate.

Additionally, yes, in terms of raw numbers quite a few people die in the US each year from gun violence, poorly-designed health systems, etc. But on the whole, life outcomes are still pretty damn good in the US--maybe not the best among all developed nations, but it isn't like you would be moving to a nation that all of a sudden can't provide its citizens with minimal security or peace of mind. If you happen to be hugely afraid of gun violence, then that's totally within your rights, and I understand why you might not want to live here. But on an absolute basis, rather than a relative one, those political issues still have very little impact on the day-to-day lives of most Americans, and you could easily move here without experiencing those negative effects."

shytemptation,AskReddit,1390714182.0,"I liked learning about sex from science teachers since they allowed students to submit anonymous questions. Talking about sex with my parents would've been weird. Then again, the only sex talks I got were from my father being perverted because he had a thing for molesting me at night and trying to get me to watch porn with him after I hit puberty... I guess I'm a bit poorly biased. 

I think the closest thing I've ever had to a normal sex talk was telling my mom what child birth felt like (like a big, painful poop), since she had c-sections with me and my siblings, and her response was that her best friend had also described it that way. It was weird to realize my mom didn't even know what child birth of the ordinary type feels like. Not really something you expect about your mother haha.

My boyfriend's family really weirded me out soon after I started dating him because they all pick on his brother for accidentally cumming in his girlfriend's ear. It was really disturbing to me that the whole family knew about his sex life enough to know about embarrassing mishaps in his sex life. That's absolutely unfathomable in my family.

Edit: Ok, disregard the above. I was just reading some of the funnier misconceptions in this thread to my bf and learned that he never had ""the talk"" or any sort of sex ed because he was home schooled. Apparently his family can joke about bj's gone wrong without actually ever bothering to teach their kids how sex works. I guess he takes the cake on pitiful lack of sex ed story time."

ebonlance,Warmachine,1390714309.0,"Don't read too much into what people are saying about stuff not being out yet. Cyriss is the newest faction and some of our models haven't been released yet. As it stands all but two of our models (albeit very good ones) will be out by April. However, as a new player you'll benefit more from proxying units and experimenting rather than flash-buying a ton of models, so this works out for you.

The thing about Warmahordes as opposed to games like 40k is that you don't need a shit-ton of extra junk to start playing. I'd heavily recommend the Cyriss battlebox, at 50 bucks MSRP at your local game store, can be found online pretty easily for 35 but if you plan on playing at a store I recommend purchasing from them whenever your wallet allows it. 

The Cyriss battlebox is one of my favorite battleboxes, and comes with a pretty potent set of vectors - a Cipher, a Galvanizer, and a Mitigator. You'll get a lot of mileage out of these guys. The caster the box comes with (think an HQ from 40k) is Syntherion, who specializes in using a lot of vectors, especially in terms of keeping them alive. That's all you need to play to start (aside from glue and paint) - the models come with cards for their stats and quick start rules that are enough to cover battlegroup-only rules. There's no specific need to own the Warmahordes equivalent of a codex, so now you have a 10-point force to play around with.

That having been said, I heavily recommend getting the book Forces of Warmahordes: Convergence and the Mk2 Prime rulebook. You're going to want the former to check the stats of models before you buy them, and the latter eventually anyway. Both are fairly cheap, you should be able to get them both for about 50 bucks total.

As for models that will tend to be pretty popular with Cyriss? The thing about Cyriss is that although it's new and there aren't quite as many options as other factions, we have the most variability between our casters and what they want. Many factions have units that will see play in 80% of their lists - this isn't generally the case with Cyriss as each of our warcasters demand very different playstyles that drastically alter your approach to the faction. There are a few things which will almost always be useful, so I'd recommend:

- A heavy vector kit or two(can be assembled as Cipher, Inverter, or Monitor. Magnetize it if you want, otherwise Inverters work well with all of our available casters. Monitors are also great but not every caster wants one. I have 2 Inverters, a Monitor and a Cipher built)

- A Diffuser (light vector, used for extending charge ranges reliably)

- An Optifex directive unit (these are our mechanic/support infantry. 3 guys who can repair jacks, make them ignore terrain, or give them the sometimes-necessary Magical Weapon quality)

- Attunement servitors (These guys drop massive AoEs of defense debuffs, making it much easier for our dudes to hit and cheaply)

- Reflex servitors (These guys are little landmine dudes that explode and are great for taking out high-defense infantry)

- Algorithmic Dispersion Optifex (lets you channel spells, some of our casters really like having one or two around) 

- A Corollary (Fantastic support vector, you must own one of these as a Convergence player. Not literally, but most of our casters like having one. Not out until march, proxy until then)

That will give you a bunch of stuff that works well with Syntherion in particular. If you're still interested in the faction as a whole, start looking into:

- All of the other warcasters. Aurora likes leading a nimble strike force, favoring assassinating the enemy caster to win the game. Axis loves bricking up melee forces and launching an implacable advance to the other side of the table. Directrix (out next month) is nasty little bag of tricks with a massive board presence and threat range. Lucant (out in March) has a competitive spell list and is difficult to take down thanks to his numerous abilities. They're all great, but they all demand very different models to really shine. I recommend one at a time.

- A unit of Obstructors. (These are our cheap tarpit infantry. Numerous, decently durable with a great board presence. Truly shine with an Enigma Foundry solo who brings three of them back a turn, but that's one of the models that won't be out until at least May. Proxy Enigma Foundries until then, tournaments aside nobody will mind. Everyone but Syntherion gets a lot of use out of these guys)

- A unit of Clockwork angels or two (must-include for Aurora, useful with other casters as a way to snipe enemy models from relative safety)

- Eradicators [Axis, Lucant], Reciprocators[Anyone but Syntherion], Perforators[Anyone but Syntherion] (We have three great but specialized heavy infantry units. Eradicators are great for clearing out infantry, Reciprocators are practically mobile terrain, and Perforators are a decent all-around threat that enemy armor doesn't want to get too close to.)

- The Prime Axiom - our hugeass vector. It's wonderful, but expensive both on the table and in reality. Works wonders with Syntherion and Directrix, Allows for some annoying tricks with Lucant, generally not the best use of points for Aurora and Axis."

Best place to live in Manila depends on what you are after. If you like to live a busy life get a condo in Makati, Taguig, Pasig. If you like quiet get a residence in the outskirts like Marikina, Cainta, Cavite area or the South. Quezon City is also a good option as it has both residential and commercial districts."

Omega037,changemyview,1390714912.0,"Unless I am misunderstanding it, in your own title you state that the fear is irrational, which means that you already know that your fear is wrong, you just can't help it.  Thus, there isn't anything to change.

As for your particular points:

&gt; I'm scared of getting hurt or worse, hurting one of my close friends. Accidents can happen and I'm not a very strong or coordinated person. I fear I won't handle a gun well and that I won't have control over it.

Accidents happen when people are ignorant about safety.  Learning how to safely hold, load, fire, unload, clean, and store a gun will reduce accidents.  Consider taking a safety course or firing at a decent range with instructors.  There it would basically be like Driver's Ed, where you have a course already setup that prevents any real accidents.

You can also be given a gun that has less recoil and fire in a position that eliminates the need for much control.  Firing a simple Winchester rifle while in a prone position, for example.

&gt; I find gun culture generally unpleasant. I don't mind that people are into guns but the entire culture around them turns me off. I don't really want to be a part of it or grow to like it.

I have a friend who heads a local gun club who is a huge right wing guy, owns tons of guns, and wears offensive T-shirts.  He often goes out with liberal college professors and college students to the range.  They don't own any guns and had often not fired one before meeting him.

&gt; Alcohol will almost certainly be involved and that scares the shit outta me. Guns and drinking, could their be a worse combo?

Any good safety class would warn against this, and I agree that it should be avoided.

&gt; I don't want to be bad at it. My friends like playing sports and video games. I don't. I feel like they will have a leg up on hitting targets and doing well and I will be the punchline, the loser who can't hit anything. I'm already the ""gay"" one, I don't like having new ways of having my ""manliness"" questioned.

I doubt they would judge you that much, but you could always use a stationary target at a short distance, and with a scope.  At that point, the only thing in your scope will be target, and you won't be able to miss it unless you try to miss.

&gt; I don't want to be closed minded. I don't want to miss a potentially fun weekend and learning something new. But I am just so intensely uncomfortable with this whole thing and see myself making an excuse and skipping it. So CMV. Why should I see this weekend as a fun adventure and not an anxiety inducing chore.

These are different issues, really.  I could see myself skipping an event if I thought unsafe gun usage would be happening.

That said, it has nothing to do with the hobby of guns themselves.  Like I said, you can go take a safety course and then have an instructor guide you without judgement at a well maintained range.  In this situation, the chance of an accident or feeling made fun of will be almost nothing, and you could learn to enjoy guns at your own pace.

Honestly, I've never met someone who, if introduced correctly, didn't absolutely love the activity."

Alfonze423,AskReddit,1390715135.0,"Sorry for the ensuing wall of text, but I've never really shared my life with anybody and my response kinda went from a planned 2 paragraphs to my whole story a little unexpectedly. Bullet Point Lessons at bottom.

Edit. I now realize I had a bloody fantastic upbringing and I shouldn't complain.  Some of these other responses are downright depressing.

For background, I'm a 20-year-old white male in his 3rd year at a university in Pennsylvania and studying Criminal Justice.  I grew up in a typical coal town of roughly 3,000 people in rural PA.   Mom immigrated from England upon marrying my dad and immediately got a full-time job in accounting after I was old enough to bottle feed. It was an hour away, though, and she'd be gone from 6am to 6pm on average during the week. My dad was full-time tech support for the local school district; he'd be gone from 8am till at least 5pm, but as late as 11pm some nights.  He still has the same job, and mom got promoted twice but is still mostly doing the same thing.

Basically my dad's parents, who lived next door, raised me as their own. Five days a week, my grandma got me ready for school, picked me up from the bus stop, made dinner while I watched tv or did my homework with my grandpa, and sent me home by 7pm to make sure I spent some time with my parents.  My grandparents took me hiking, kite-flying, taught me to ride a bike, taught me carpentry, gave me their world views, etc from age 3 until age 13.  Then lung cancer and dementia set in for mom mom and pop pop, respectively, and they died 2 and 5 years later.  It's worth noting they were 74 when I was born in '93.  Not the most active childhood, let me tell you.

Through high school, I saw my parents about 3 hours a day, not counting weekends, which were chore days and basically meant watching them work.  They were pretty uninvolved, but critiqued my report cards when my passion for learning started to falter in 6th grade. I was supposed to get straight A's while also teaching myself how the world works, and later watching my grandparents slowly die. I had to work hard, so I could impress two people who didn't seem to really care.  Then, I was meant to go to a good college and get a well-paying job so I could get out of the area and become some big-shot they'd be proud of.

After a couple long conversations with them since I've come to college, I found out they actually thought that giving me a good house, nice toys, and a comfy bedroom via those 50- to 60-hour jobs and handing me over to my grandparents was the best way to look after me (summarized. This makes them sound worse than they were).  This is basically what I told them they should have done better and what they got right:

**LESSONS LEARNED:**

*Spend time with your kids.  Money is nice and makes life comfier after the necessities are taken care of, but it's no replacement for quality time with mom and dad.

*Don't set unrealistic expectations.  I don't even really know what they wanted from me, but various dreams have been shot down over the years.  For example, when I told my mom I wanted to join the PA State Police this past summer, she said she was disappointed.  Not just worried, but disappointed, too.  ""You could do so much more, Alfonze423!""  She pushed me to major in business after engineering proved too tough, but I never wanted it and moved to Criminal Justice for year 3 of college.  I'm actually enjoying my classes this school year and I can't wait to join the State Police!

*Take a real interest in your kid's education, including outside of school.  Ask what they learned today, help them study, encourage a variety of interests.  DO NOT get discouraged when their education outpaces your own, until they're sophomores in high school, anyway.  Learn it with them if you can, as your own interest will bolster theirs. This applies to basically anything a child could learn about, not just school subjects.

*Read your kids to sleep through Kindergarten, at least.  If my parents hadn't, I probably would've stopped caring about school a lot sooner.  It's probably also the only reason I still enjoy reading on my own or learning just to learn.

*Don't force a sport or interest on them, just encourage it.  When I didn't like baseball after a year, it was okay.  Same for soccer.  But when I joined the Boy Scouts and wanted to quit after two years, my mom persuaded me to stick with it for 6 more months before leaving to see if I might rediscover the passion I had upon joining, and I ended up earning the highest rank and staying on as an adult leader for 2 and a half years now.  Other than the reading, it was the best thing she's ever done for me.  I'm very happy she was persistent I stick with it, as she knew it would be a great opportunity for me, and it really was.

*If your kid's got a hobby, interest, or organization, GET INVOLVED.  My dad's involvement in my troop made the difference when my mom convinced me to stick with it, and he ended up really enjoying it as well.  He did the same with my interests in model trains and cycling.  Just don't go overboard.  When I started throwing javelin in high school, he bought me instructional videos and practice javs, but I ended up moving to running sports my 2nd year and staying there.

*Travel.  Visiting New York, Delaware, Washington, Canada, England, and just day-tripping all over PA showed me just how huge our world is, and how much there is to explore and learn.  Museum trips to Philadelphia were the best when I was growing up.  It doesn't have to be expensive; just going to a new place at least 100 miles away every year will have a tremendous impact.

*Lastly, just be a good role model.  Even though they did a less-than-stellar job of raising me, my parents did a fantastic job of being good people.  I'm somewhat selfless, care about the environment and politics, work hard for things I want, and I have a general respect for everyone I meet.*  **If nothing else, JUST BE A DECENT PERSON and your kids will probably turn out to be reasonably OK people.**"

incogito_ergo,financialindependence,1390715139.0,"I have a lot of leveraged realty. RE in general performs well in an inflationary environment (rents tend to follow inflation, and property values as well more or less).  Add to that the fact that inflation is decreasing the value of your debt, and you get some very compelling returns.  Precious metals are another common inflation hedge (I recently took a position in the vanguard precious metals fund as well).

You're right though, in a deflationary environment my portfolio would be savaged.  Our government has indicated pretty strongly that they would rather see inflation than deflation, however, and with all the QE craziness I feel pretty confident that the odds of us seeing significant deflation are less than the odds of us seeing hyperinflation (not terribly likely)."

Then I draw a Cultist card. And a card that can turn people into Cultists. And another Cultist card, which I promptly traded off to a guy who really wanted to be a Cultist. And everyone else was a Cultist, too. Yeah... the guy who owned that set (and was the level 9 guy) wasn't particularly happy about me force-summoning Cthulhu, basically as a rage-quit."

DieMensch-Maschine,AskHistorians,1390715355.0,"First of all, we need to clarify what you're asking.  Are you referring to the Great East-West Schism of 1053 in which the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople mutually excommunicated one another?  Or are you referring to the Great Western Schism 1378-1418 which resulted from the Avignonese Papacy and the election of two, and later even three popes?  In either one of these scenarios, asking about Austria is problematic.  Until the later fifteenth century it's neither an important European entity nor a bi-confessional state. Likewise, there was no ""Italy"" until the risorgimento (Italian unification) in the nineteenth century.  Until then, the Italian Peninsula was occupied by a dozen competing principalities. The Kingdom of Sicily and the Kingdom of Naples functioned as a bi-confessional states, with both Western (Latin) and Eastern (Greek) Christian populations.  However, due to the proximity to Papal Rome and the fact that the ruling families identified as Latin Christian, Catholicism remained politically dominant. Poland accepted Latin (Western) Christianity starting in 966 and it remained the state confession thereafter.  In 1349 Kazimierz III (The Great) acquired eastern Ruthenian lands that made Poland a bi-confessional state with a sizable Orthodox (Eastern) Christian population.  This Eastern Christian population increased in size further after 1385, or the establishment of a personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  For the next two centuries, the Polish-Lithuanian state was home to a large and powerful Orthodox Christian nobility.  However, they were never a threat to the dominant Latin Christian (Catholic) creed, especially since the Crown remained Catholic.  In the Middle Ages, as in the Reformation, the ruling authority tended to be a determining factor in confessional predominance.

He doesn't actually care about your feelings than. Do you know the difference between selfish love and selfless love? Selfish love is when you love the way someone makes you feel, or what they do for you. Selfless is when you love them and want them to be happy regardless of their imperfections or flaws. He's happy and accepts you when you fit his ideals. 

This might be fine and dandy for you now (although it shouldn't be), but what if you guys end up getting married? You really want to be ""in the wrong"" for the rest of your life? Do you really want to have to hide your feelings because you don't want to be ridiculed for them? Your boyfriend is the one that's suppose to make you feel better when you're hurt, not make you feel like shit. The fact that his pride/ego/whatever is more important than your feelings is just not okay at all. 

I think you guys should go to couple's counseling. Eventually his inability to accept that he's not always right *will* end the relationship. A trained professional should be able to mediate and help you express your feelings in a way where he can't blow them off. "

In the end, you have no choice but to follow through. If you say you are going to get help, stick to it. If things feel stable for awhile, do not stop getting help and falling back into destructive patterns. Depression is something that will not magically go away, but what changes, is you learn how to cope with it. I have accepted that I will probably always suffer from depression, but I have since learned coping techniques to get me through the bad times without being a jerk. 

As far as laziness, I used to be that way, so I learned how to do small amounts of cleaning while doing things I love. For example, I throw on something from the dvr that has commercials, and during every commercial break, I clean. I then sit back down and enjoy until the next. The best way to do this is with network movies because they last forever and have tons of commercials. If you are into internet browsing, set an alarm for 3 mins of cleaning, every 20-30 mins. It adds up fast, and after a certain point you will just want to keep cleaning. 

As far as friends, you can try meetup.com to meet people in your area who have similar interests. 

Main thing, take the steps necessary, but dont overwhelm yourself to the point where you feel stuck. Flylady.net is a great site for people who procrastinate to make babysteps to have an immaculate home. I love the daily missions =)

I am so sorry to hear about your situation, but I hope it helps.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390715664.0,"As someone who lives in a poor democratic city, the thing is people vote for democrats because they're poor, they aren't poor because they vote for democrats. Republican policies exacerbate poverty among the poor. Take the refusal to accept the medicaid expansion, for example. You guys stick it to the poor, and support policies that are blatantly anti poor. You cut social services that help the poor, for instance. You support dysfunctional sex ed and anti abortion policies, which lead to higher teenage pregnancy and motherhood, which deepens the cycle of poverty. You may have lower unemployment, but this is largely due to lower wages in the first place. So, you got low wages, with fewer social programs, and backwards sex ed policies, just to name a few off the top of my head, and somehow, the author of that article says that democrats can't name policies that lead to higher poverty in those states? 

Also, the pre 1964 democratic party is not the modern democratic party, so idk why they even bring that up. The whole south flipped affiliation since then. 

That being said you kinda have to expect this from forbes...a magazine that blatantly has a pro republican bias. I mean, did you even look at the author of the article? You can trace him right back to a right wing think tank.

when I play Valve games, I don't mind paying for those small items because the game is so damn good and has brought me so much enjoyment. I think of it as a donation to Valve's hard work, and the more I play the game, the more comfortable I am with buying all these cosmetics. 

Why do I keep playing the game? It is precisely because the game doesn't try to short change me as a gamer, and give me everything i need to play it.

To test the true band size, put the bras on backwards, and see how loose the bands are.  You'll almost certainly be able to pull them several inches away from your body, much too much for them to offer any support.

sporadically_rabbit,anime,1390715869.0,"There's a combination of factors that play into it.

Primarily, I would say it depends on what everyone else calls the show (e.g. since everyone else already knows it as The World God Only Knows, it means less confusion to keep referring to it as such, but at the same time, this is true with something like Binbougami-ga! (which I've never seen being called The God of Poverty as its title, even when it's translated as such in-show).

Secondarily: As of about a year ago, MyAnimeList started changing all of their titles over to the Japanese version, and with it being the most popular show-tracker here, many of the new shows get known by the Japanese names as a result.

And so on: Other factors include things like people speaking non-Japanese, non-English languages, so there's little reason for them to translate to English, whereas if it's kept in Japanese, it's consistent.  There's also the argument something along the lines of ""Well this is what it's really called, anything else is up to interpretation of the person translating."".  Some shows also just have shoddy translations (The standard example is ""Asobi ni Iku yo!"" being officially called ""Cat Planet Cuties"" in English, despite translating as ""Let's go play"".  On the other hand, ""Gin no Saji"" to ""Silver Spoon"" is a good translation, and it is pretty much used interchangeably here.  With regards to Attack on Titan specifically, there was also one sub group that created a bit of a stir in that they considered the official translation to be incorrect, and when subbing, renamed it.), or ones that don't even get used officially.  E.g. ""Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii wake ga nai"" on English release was still just OreImo (not sure if it included a space), and with that example, there's also a matter of it sounding less creepy if left untranslated (this argument was used prior to the second season ending, at least).  With shows that have excessively long names (such as OreImo, Yuushibu, Noucome, Oregairu, Oreshura, etc., it's also just easier to use the heavily truncated version of the name, which when taking it back out to the full version, is easier to stick with the Japanese, rather than also trying to remember the translation straight up."

It would require a way to effectively get rid of waste that wont harm local waterways. These are big reasons you don't see more of these plants in places like California which for the most part has not had the kind of water problems that desert areas like the Middle East have.

connor_g,introvert,1390715962.0,"Yuuuuuuup.

For me it's stressful because of the lack of context. For as much as regular in-person interactions can be stressful, phone conversations are much worse because you can't see the person and often can barely even hear or understand them.

If you have and iPhone with iOS 7, try doing a FaceTime Audio call, though. It wasn't a really well-publicized feature, but as long as both parties on the call are using iPhones, it allows you to do audio over your wifi or data connection rather than over the antiquated phone network. The end result is *drastically* better audio quality, so good you can often hear the ambient noise around the person in perfect clarity (but not in a distracting way). It makes it a lot easier to hear and understand the person you're talking to, which makes phone calls a lot less stressful for me, personally."

The story is set in a future theocratic American society, ruled by the latest in a series of fundamentalist Christian “Prophets.” The First Prophet was Nehemiah Scudder, a backwoods preacher turned President, then dictator.
One of the Prophet's Virgins, Sister Judith. Judith, new to the vocation, faints when she is called upon to render sexual service to the Prophet and is confined to her quarters until she sees the light.

The truth is, I have yet to see any couple reconcile a marriage where financially you cannot come to some agreement. Discuss your situations and decide together what the outcome should be. Maybe let her claim the credit if she gives you a portion, or vice versa. 

If you can't discuss it and compromise, if you both are just going to dig in your heels, then I'm sorry the marriage can't work. Hire a professional to do your taxes and explain exactly the situation and see what they say because it will matter if/when the IRS gets involved."

LTmad,AskMen,1390716293.0,"I'm sorry but after reading a few of your comments above and below, it really appears to me that you're fishing for alternate excuses to justify why a man wouldn't be able to net himself a woman. 

I'll skip over my subtle assumptions about your love life and say that she's got it right above you. If a man isn't attracting women, trying to blame society or upbringing is just deflecting the blame. Upbringing? Sure, maybe he grew up in a broken household or around people who absolutely sabotaged his knowledge - it's possible. But he should be able to figure that out eventually and fix/improve himself for it. Society? Get the fuck out of town. If you're going to start questioning if society is wrong, then you're clearly missing the picture altogether. YOU live in this society. YOU grew up in this society (or whichever other society). (*insert man into equation here*) should be more or less aware of the cultural norms in his respective society.

If a man is generally deemed unattractive to women and time and time again gets shot down, it's not society's fault. It's his fault for not molding himself or figuring out how to change himself in positive ways so as to attract said women.

TL; DR If a man thinks society is to blame for a himself being ""unattractive,"" then he needs to take a step back and look at himself. Or as the lady above said, if the common factor among all the different, various, changing women is the one single guy who isn't making it...well do the damn math."

You are all worse than any of the bottom 99% in serial killers, murderers, war mongerers, etc. individually by counting inactions with ability + actions with choice.

ArcFurnace,askscience,1390716388.0,"Ok, going to have to explain a few concepts to explain this.  

Sound is a pressure wave in a medium; you can record the pressure as it rises and falls to produce a line that represents the sound.  Now, this signal can have a fairly arbitrary shape, depending on what produced the noise.  Mathematicians have shown that you can take any line and ""disassemble"" it into a sum of many sine waves, each with its own frequency and amplitude.  This is done using a mathematical equation called the [Fourier transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform).  Instead of the original plot of pressure versus time, you have a plot of amplitude versus frequency that represents the same sound.  This is useful for analyzing sound waves.  

One of the things you can do with this is examine how much of the signal's power is concentrated in a certain frequency range.  As an example, the Fourier transform of a tuning fork playing [middle A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440_(pitch_standard) will have a lot of amplitude at a frequency of 440 Hz, and less elsewhere, possibly with peaks at certain other frequencies.  

""White noise"" is a sound signal where the amplitude in the Fourier transform is constant with frequency.  ""Pink noise"" is when the amplitude decreases as the frequency increases (the amplitude is proportional to 1/f, where f is the frequency).  "

He was the best SS in the league for several years (not that he's a slouch now) because he was also a great playmaker, getting the important picks and forcing fumbles.

He changed my entire life by suggesting right side amygdalohippocampectomy in 2007. I have been seizure free since then and life couldn't be better. My husband and I were married six months after the surgery and we now have a two year old. This was something I had never dreamed possible. 

I guess my only question is whether you have had patients with sleep maintenance issues after SAH? Maybe that's more difficult to measure with your young patients, but I have to ask. I've always struggled with getting to sleep but never with staying asleep, that is until after the surgery. I still take 600 mg of carbamazepine daily. It's nothing compared to the seizures but still so frustrating when I have a toddler to take care of!

And meanwhile the TV companies can make more with less because of digital broadcasting even though it's only MPEG2.

Verizon bought the vast majority of the low frequency (ie very penetrating and valuable) 700-ish Mhz band in 2007 or 2008 but it was recently forced to sell some to T-Mobile USA in exchange for being allowed to buy some midwest carrier.

Doesn't seem they're doing that well to me.

Yes, they balanced the budget, but what no one is saying is how it was balanced? I know Corbett did the same thing here in PA and it's been rather disastrous if you ask me. Education cuts galore, putting more burdens on an already strained education system. 

According to this, Wisconsin borrowed the money, which will put it further in debt in the long term.

So to me, it sounds like this is just conservative propaganda. 

EDIT: Yep, they made massive education cuts.

http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/wisconsins-school-funding-cuts-among-the-nations-deepest-2

Hurts students, puts teachers out of work, etc. Looking into older sources that led to wisconsin to trend this way also cites massive medicaid cuts.

nappythrill22,changemyview,1390717466.0,"As dangerous as it is to drive stoned (albeit not *nearly* as dangerous as alcohol, or even many prescription pharmaceutical drugs) I think you should leave it up to his judgement whether he is too stoned or not. He is a big boy, and as an adult should understand his own limits. Furthermore, if he can be persuaded to be more conscious of the ways and times of day when he feels like consuming, he should be able to plan his daily medicating around his needs for transportation. For instance, if he knows that he needs to run an errand in 3 hours, he should be able to have a small dose immediately, and be okay to drive again by the time 3 hours has passed. 

If you are in a state where there is no Medical MJ, than *legally* speaking it would be advisable to have him stop altogether. If MMJ is a viable option, make him get a prescription which will add a layer (not complete protection) of legal leeway for DUIs. In states with MMJ laws, giving DUIs to MMJ patients for being too high to drive is entirely dependent on the driver failing a field sobriety test because blood tests are so inconclusive about a persons sobriety (unlike alcohol which has very well scientifically defined levels of sobriety/intoxication) due to huge variances in tolerance between individuals. Additionally, the mere presence of a prescription document at the time of detainment is enough to discourage most LEOs toward further action, like seizures for possession, because they don't want to deal with the legal headaches either.

In regards to the issue of having a gun in the car, the gun should be transported in a safe and legal manner *regardless* of whether your car has a tail light out, or whether he has consumed MJ. That way, even if he (or even you for that matter) were pulled over, and asked for a search (and yes smell alone is PC for a search in most jurisdictions), there would be no way that the presence of said firearm would have any legal ramifications.

Dantilli,socialskills,1390717559.0,"I know exactly how you feel. I've spent the last year getting over these anxieties. Although for me I had anxiety talking to pretty much ANYONE.

I've looked at every bit of advice I could find, tried everything you can imagine and more. But it all came down to just two facts:

1. The motivation. ""You miss 100% of the balls you don't swing for"" (or whatever your preferred analogy). That is irrefutable logical evidence that it's better to try than to not.

2. I was fucking sick of all that anxiety. Started hating it more than anything in the world. One day I was about to go talk to a couple of new people and felt that anxiety again and I had, had enough. I'd got to the point that I was more bored of my anxiety than anything. Bored of feeling that way in every situation. I realised, it doesn't control me, it is merely a suggestion. A very compelling and hard to resist suggestion, but it does not have control, YOU have control. So I just flipped and shouted ""Fuck you anxiety, I'm sick of your shit. I'm doing what I want for a change"". So I did. It wasn't comfortable, the actual conversation (and many that followed) was awkward as anything, but I did it. Now that I know that I can beat it I just do what I want. 

It's still uncomfortable sometimes (but not self inflicted this time) and the anxiety is still there (though much, much less powerful). It was just a case of proving to myself that I am capable of overcoming it. Now it's like passing through a toll booth, just a minor inconvenience.

Now obviously you are not me, but hopefully you can take something from this. Good luck :)

thro_way,changemyview,1390717561.0,"&gt; But I need you to understand that being white is preferential in society. Being black isn't.

No shit.  Can you understand that being able to communicate with other people is preferential in every society in the history of civilization?  Being autistic isn't.

&gt;Have autistic people ever been forcefully taken away from their home countries, stripped of their dignity and culture, forced to assimilate to white standards, etc.?

From 0 to 1700 AD, the standard procedure for an autistic person, if you didn't want to just kill them outright, was to chain them up in a room somewhere and throw a bucket of food in every few days.  Around the beginning of the 18th century, we still locked them up, but started performing medical experiments on them as well.  In the 1800s, it became popular to pay to see these ""freaks"" all chained up.  The medical experimentation picked up, and around the start of the 1900s it finally became required to give them food and clothing. The '20s marked the start of the era of institutionalization.  No longer were autistics kept chained up in isolation; they're now imprisoned in overcrowded asylums, where obviously, they're subject to more experimentation, including drug-induced comas, electroshock therapy, and of course, lobotomies.  Nowadays, while sure, they can't get jobs and are harassed in every interaction they'll ever have, at least it's not legal to forcefully sterilize them anymore.  Oh wait, in a number of states it is.

Name a way in which autistic whites have it better than neurotypical blacks.  Seriously.  Name *one* single aspect where autistics aren't at an *unbelievable* disadvantage.  Don't just say they exist, name one.  Autistic white guys don't become CEOs, they don't go to college, they don't live longer or get paid more, they don't see people like them on TV, they can't live in communities of people like them.  They're far more likely to be homeless, abused, and are 28x more likely to attempt suicide.  By *every* conceivable metric, autistics have it unequivocally worse than you, regardless of their skin color, gender, sexuality, class background, whatever.

&gt;I'm not trying to play ""who has it worse"", but there are certain things you don't compare to each other.

Then why the fuck did you compare them?"

JackPAnderson,IAmA,1390717649.0,"&gt;I will say that how much you reveal about what happened to you should be related to what kind of relationship it is.  A boyfriend/girlfriend relation will have a lot more disclosure than a one-night or casual thing.

As a top, I really need to know if there is some potential minefield waiting for me, even with a casual play partner. Obviously I don’t need every last detail, but just saying, ""I have a history. X, y, and z are triggers for me and are hard limits,"" is a basic requirement. 

It's play. The idea is to have fun. Causing unintended damage is the antithesis of fun. It is not my fantasy to cause someone to need therapy to recover from a scene!

sfzen,nfl,1390717667.0,"Any kickoff can be recovered by the kicking team to retain possession. An onside kick refers to a kick that is aimed short and to one side in an attempt for the kicking team to recover the ball. Usually for an onside, you want to kick the ball down so it takes a high bounce and your team has time to catch up and jump for the ball. The kicking team will line up differently for onside kicks than normal kickoffs, putting extra men on the side of the field they are kicking towards.

A regular kickoff is basically just... kick it as hard as you can. You want it to either go into or out of the endzone for a touch back, or if you want to try to force a return and pin them deep, you can sacrifice some distance for a bit more hangtime. 

There are also squib kicks, which are sort of like line-drive kicks. straight forward, not high up at all, so that the ball bounces around. The goal is to make one of the blockers return the kick to prevent the risk of a long return by the fast return man."

savoytruffle,AskReddit,1390717911.0,"Right so again I don't know about Canada. In like 2008 local over-the-air (like from antenna) TV stations went silent and the part of the electromagnetic spectrum (think of it like the FM dial but extended out on both ends for miles and miles and miles), well their part was confiscated by the part of the US government that controls it.

In exchange, the FCC gave them a different part to start broadcasting anew. But this time it had to be digital. It had to be essentially the same kind of data you get off a DVD disc (MPEG-2)

New TV's could deal with it. Old tv's could not so the government gave everyone two coupons to buy converter boxes to deal with it. Man this was so recent in my mind, but I now realize it was kind of a long time ago.

Anyway the FCC (USA Federal Communications Commission) did this in part because it had been planning to do it forever since the Clinton administration. (That's why it was MPEG2 and not MPEG4).

But also so the FM radio space freed up by there no longer being tv stations on them (which are around the radio space used by FM radio even now) is very valuable.

It's more useful nowadays for cell phone companies than it was forty years ago for television broadcasters.

And also in general, modern digital radio methods are much more data-efficient than old analog ones. So where once there was one tv station licensed for the whole country, now there's perhaps ten thousand cell towers serving thousands of cell phones apiece.

this is a gross simplification, but you get the idea."

CommunistPlatypi,Games,1390717916.0,"Mostly been playing **Freespace 2** and some mods for it (with the help of the Source Code Project and FreeSpace Upgrade project's modifications), most notably *Wings of Dawn*, an anime inspired mod, and *Blue Planet*, which is one a few attempts (and the best, in my opinion) to pick up where the story of the vanilla game ends.

This isn't the first time I've played through any of those, but they're fun enough that I keep coming back to them year after year.

So, **Freespace 2** is a space combat sim, which in this case means you fly around in fighters shooting other fighters, bombers, and occasionally capital ships. It sounds pretty simple and not all that impressive, but the game play is amazingly fun, and the story is honestly really rather good. 

**Descent: Freespace: The Great War**, the first game in the series, came out in 1998, followed by a expansion pack, **Silent Threat**, which is generally considered to be fairly mediocre. (The community, however, has produced a new, much better take on that expansion, called **Silent Threat: Reborn**. The next year, **FreeSpace 2** is released, to critical acclaim, but to less than stellar sales, resulting in that being the last FreeSpace game produced. 

There were a variety of fanmade mods/missions, (Created with the same editor that Volition used to make the canonical missions, FRED and FRED2) produced. In 2003 however, the game's source code was released. After a small amount of initial scrambling, the Source Code Project was formed, which has been upgrading and otherwise improving the engine.

Many mods take advantage of the new features in FSOpen, including what is probably the most popular, the MediaVPs, a set of high resolution, high poly, high quality replacements for retail ships and textures.

And I personally definitely believe that we will. It'll in all likelihood be along way from now, and I wouldn't count on us being alive when it happens, but humanity will get there. At this point in time, we're slowly edging closer and closer in technology toward it being possible. At this current rate, it'll be along time but will be achieved.

However, in a very optimistic view, it could be way sooner than anyone would expect. For thousands of years, humans never really made to huge of progress. But with the discovery of how to harness electricity, things have jumped massively in less then 150 years. I mean, in the early 1800s, cars, TVs, internet, airplanes, and all kinds of things were virtually unthinkable. But with that one discovery, they've all became became extremely common place. If some discovery of that magnitude was made, there's no telling where we would be soon afterwards.

redwhiskeredbubul,relationships,1390718247.0,"Your brother sounds pretty entitled. He also sounds pretty depressed. 

Here's the thing. Especially in men, depression doesn't necessarily manifest as sadness, crying etc. It's more typically characterized by irritability, lack of motivation, foggy thinking, irregular sleeping, and so on.  

You're entirely right that your parents are enabling your brother. Here's the problem: by enlisting you to talk to him, they're enlisting you to enable your brother. They're also getting you to enable themselves. So the first thing I would tell your brother, and your parents, is that you're not going to run interference for them. 

Beyond that, what happens if you give your brother a reality check? It depends--I'm not quite sure what you mean. He's probably somewhat aware of how he's acting like a jerk. If you mean forcing him to get a job, kicking him out of the house, etc, My guess, based on experience, is that he will fix some things in his life but not all of them: he's more likely to do the bare minimum necessary to keep himself going at his current clip. And he'll likely resent it. Moreover, he'll still be unhappy.

Here's the other thing. Your brother's life is not difficult financially, etc. But it is likely difficult psychologically for him. He needs to both to get better and build up enough self-respect so that he can face up to when he's imposing on other people. Slagging on you is his defense mechanism: it's how he keeps a modicum of self-respect. He needs better self-defense mechanisms. 
 
So what do? Here's my guess: tell your brother to stop anticipating the hammer coming down (which he's likely doing and he likely dreads) because, well, it might, and tell him to go into therapy and get legal meds. "

In general when I tried to date one identical twin out of a couple, I liked the taller and thinner girl better, but the other twin was always a lot nicer to me.

And why? I'd have to say her personality. The nice twin was very nice. The other one was distant and I couldn't tell what she was thinking, so that intrigued me.

Of course the other hard part is ever getting them apart. I took the twin I liked on a date once, to a pretty awesome art exhibit, but the only tickets I could get were on a Sunday so afterwards she said she had to go home and study.

And it was a lot of fun to hang out with both of them. That's how I met them, through my friend who was friends with them both.

But if you're to fuck one twin out of two, how do you do it??

Trying to understand someone experiencing a mental illness or trying to understand someone committing a sexual abuse crime is not the same as a man *refusing* to try and understand an activity before banning it, You don't need to get into the rapists head to know that rape is wrong, You just need to get into the victims head to know they have been wronged. the issue with abortion is that everyone involed is a victim.

We understand what rape is, We understand what the murder of a viable, born child is. We don't understand abortion, because the argument of when life begins is not a black and white one, the crime does not involve two people, a perpetrator and a victim, It involves one or two persons depending on your answer to the previous question, and both of them can be victims depending on your understanding of the situation.

""what"" an abortion is changes depending on who's getting it. Sometimes its in self-defence, sometimes it's an act of preventing a life of suffering (eg: deformed foetus) Sometimes its an act of protecting ones sanity (eg: aborting your rapists baby) The motive behind the abortion alters how many victims there are and it changes the nature of the activity.

In your examples. a rape is a rape. A drowning is a drowning. But without asking ""why does a woman want an abortion"" you can not truly define what it is."

For the individual albums, I think it's more about what pictures have been chosen to represent each of you.. the first picture in the Grace album is just killer.. it's full of pretty girl and full of personality.  The promish picture is also very pretty and the rest just come up as faces of Grace.. 

From the Eve album.. most of the pictures are just barely out of focus and the only one that I look at and think I would like to get to know that pretty girl is the last one on the beach.

I have no qualms about saying large portions of the population are ignorant if I can defend the point that they are. And then a large proportion of the population votes for crazy anti abortion policies, votes against gay marriage, is opposed to the mere thought of background checks on firearms, thinks Obama is literally a marxist, votes for a party that has threatened to take us off the fiscal cliff time and time again while actually believing the propaganda that Obama was responsible, goes on and on and on about Benghazi, votes against their economic interests, etc. etc. etc. I think my point is justified."

I worked for a year as a substitute and frankly, the amount of children that were put on ADD / ADHD medication was alarming and often had the opposite affect usually.

But I'm not really ADD / ADHD - I do however have the damnedest time focusing and caffeine/ stimulants do help me considerably. 

Some places depending on where you go do have the, ""better children through chemistry"" idea. Hell, when I was in elementary school kids were being ""diagnosed"" left and right and it was frightening.

You say you have commitment issues, and you also say you've met an amazing, inspiring guy who, as if by chance, happens to do things to push you away, does not speak English as a first language, and coincidentally, happens to live on another  continent. You also don't saw how or why you'd be going back to South Africa. 

While I believe you about all the positive things you've said about this guy, it seems like you've also set up a relationship situation which is rigged not to work out. After all, you'd have to commit to this guy fifteen times harder than in a regular relationship in order for it to work at all for purely logisitical reasons. And I think there's a part of you that wants to keep this relationship halfway unreal and at a fantasy level. Which would be consistent with having commitment issues.

&gt; Not every girl, but they all do bullshit tests and act like bitches 

Okay.. Not every girl, but they **all** do bullshit tests and act like bitches.

That's contradictory information.

If, since you don't specify, ALL girls are mean to you then you need to take the axiom ""the one thing in common in all your failed relationships is you"" and take stock of how you are acting and reacting toward them which might raise their defenses and cause them to act in a manner you are characterizing as being mean.  If you find some of your behaviors you think might be doing that, look closely enough at them to see if changing those behaviors feels false, like you're not being real.   Change what still feels like you are being you, and see how the outcomes change.


You're not giving any examples of what this testing/mean/power grabbing behavior is so mean might not be the correct descriptor.

If it's not all the girls you interact with, is it any consistent sub-group, like the girls who may have an interest in romantically all do this, or do those you're looking to become friends with do it too?

Overall, I stick with the simple.   Do Not Use Game.  Be who you are, and keep growing who you are to be the best version of you that you can be.   If someone does not accept that or is mean to you because of it, then they don't need to be a part of your life.  "

Quarians can't be biotics because their physiology can't handle eezo contamination.  Likewise, synthetics can't be biotics because despite all the technological development, synthetic circuits still don't match the precision of organic central nervous systems.

The speed and effectiveness with which human ambition is growing within the galaxy, when compared to every other species, means that a humans-vs-everyone war is inevitable.

Biotic development among the asari is a result of ships' drive cores crashing to the surface when the prothean's ""shielded"" the primitive asari from an invading species, and was entirely accidental.  Likewise, their unique breeding method is a result of the protheans desperately using genetic engineering to protect the last handful of primitive asari from extinction following the major ecological disasters that followed.

Udina wasn't actually indoctrinated.  He was just desperate and thought a coup against the council would help him divert more resources to defending Earth.

Miranda's infertility was intentionally done by her father, in an attempt to ensure she'd have to clone herself too, and thus his own genetic code would not be diluted in his legacy.

The reaper IFF from ME2 is still installed in ME3, which is why whenever the Normandy flies through a warzone, the Reapers never attack it.

Grunt can't actually take off his suit completely.  The light in the middle of his chest is a bioreactor designed to more efficiently convert nutrients into energy and that connects directly to his nervous systems.  That's why he's usually hungry immediately after exerting himself."

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1390719746.0,"The fact I was the mature one in the relationship... even though I was 11 years his junior. The fact pot and alcohol were practically a religion; I knew about the pot which at first I was sorta ok with, but he hid his alcoholism surprisingly well, at first. I'm not your average bear and shit doesn't get by me and if it does, it isn't for very long. 

He was blowing 40-100 (or more) dollars a week on pot which was just ridiculous and near the end I was basically thrown to the wayside and sort of shut out because of it. Final straw for me was when he found a $100 in his laundry and started calling people trying to find a dime bag... at 2 in the morning.

A red flag was the longest he'd ever had employment was for 2 years, and an arrest. I found out when I broke it off he'd had multiple arrests on his record. He's now currently being gone after for grand larceny by his latest employment, the job I helped him secure.... 

I was ready to end it 6 months in, but he got fired form the job he had so I thought I'd be the nice guy and help him find another job, which I did and then I said ""SEE YAH!"" 

People ask what I saw in him, but I never got to date in high school really, and was desperate for someone to love and visa versa. He was my first and what I now refer to as my ""training wheel relationship."" 

Some folks say I should have stayed with him and helped him fight his addictions, but I'm sorry, I knew a lost cause when I saw it and I have my own life to live TYVM.

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,DesignMyRoom,1390719780.0,"Personally, I'm not a fan of the futon. Even though it sounds perfect, it usually ends up being a kind of crappy couch and a kind of crappy bed. The fold usually becomes a major dip right down the center of the mattress. And it's kind of annoying having to transform it all the time (more especially, when the time is right!).

I would consider making your full bed into a daybed type thing. Basically, rotate your bed 90 degrees clockwise so that the pillows are against the window wall. Then add a bunch of large pillows lengthwise down the bed against the wall. Now your bed will act like a lounging sofa and won't be so bed like. But you still have an actual bed when you need it. 

You could do [one long circle/roll pillow with other pillows leaning on it](http://billbarr.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/3_1286307947_ed_0507_cochran_1.jpg). Or [many large pillows in different prints (but similar colors)](http://allhomedecors.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/cozy-balinese-daybed-with-canopy.jpg). These aren't the colors or materials I would suggest, just the basic ideas of them. Target has a large selection of solid color large sized pillows to go against the back, and then you can just add your normal sleeping pillows on top as long as you have good sheets. 

The cons of this arrangement is you have to take off all the pillows to sleep. But this is easier than unfolding the futon every night. Another con is the bed will still take up more space than a folded futon. But I think by rotating it you will still be able to fit a coffee table next to it. 

The pro is you don't have to buy a new bed, just some decorative pillows. Another pro is you now have a lounging bed. You could have a bunch of freinds lounge and play video games. You can have movie night with everyone laid back. Most importantly, when you have people over whom you may want to woo, they are now in a more casual relaxed position. It's a lot easier to transition from making out on the lounge bed and then into bedbed than making out on a futon and having to stop and unfold out the futon.  

I hope that's any help. Send update pics with whatever you choose to do!

Skulder,Denmark,1390720072.0,"Nu har du listet en række punkter med spørgsmål, men hvis det er helt okay, så vil jeg snarere lave min egen liste.

Jeg stoler ikke på regeringen, fordi jeg for ofte ser:

Beslutninger der er drevet af ideologi snarere end sund fornuft.  
(fedtskatten for eksempel, beslutningen og udførslen af salget af ungdomshuset, havnetunnelen)  
Hvis en beslutning er baseret på fornuft, undersøgelser, beregninger etc, så ændres beslutningen hvis grundlaget ændres. En beslutning baseret på ideologi ændres kun hvis ideologien ændres - og det synes jeg er farligt.

Beslutninger hvor det er rigtig svært at se om der er ond vilje eller inkompetence gemt i hensigten. Offentlighedsloven. Logningsloven. De er skadelige for demokratiet, men kom de fordi vores folkevalgte er lidt dumme, eller kom de fordi vores folkevalgte er nogle bæster?  
Ingen af mulighederne tiltaler mig.

Og så er der selvfølgelig Foghs nato-post, og retssagen mod ROJ-TV.

( ROJ TV er en kurdisk tv-station der prøver at sende kurdisk kultur-tv til kurdere, og prøver at lave relevante ikke-propagandiserede nyheder fra tyrkiet, især med relevans for Kurdere. Hver gang de har lavet interviews med Kurdiske oprørere, partisaner eller lign, er de blevet beskyldt for at lave propaganda for PKK, fordi de giver taletid til terrorister. Det svarer vel lidt til at anklage en fra DR for piraterivirksomhed, fordi det er lykkedes ham at få et interview med en af piraterne fra Aden-bugten. Kort fortalt var der ikke rigtig noget at komme efter, men Fogh fik Tyrkiets stemme til NATO-posten, og ROJ-TV blev lige pludselig interessant for de danske domstole.)"

dublos,AskReddit,1390720228.0,"Find something that is yours, as a couple.

A friend I work with was living with his girlfriend and whenever she came home from work the cat always ran up for loves.   He was going to tie the ring to the cat's collar, but I brought up the fact that'll be the one time the cat sleeps through her arrival or loses the ring down a heat vent.

But he also mentioned that he loved it when she made him brownies and would always respond to them with a ""I love you, you made me brownies, marry me!""

That's about as good an opening as you get.. so the plan was to do that the next time she made him brownies, except this time with the ring in his hand.

Then.. she didn't make him brownies.   And she didn't make him brownies.. so finally I texted her that he'd mentioned how awesome her brownies were and that he'd promised to bring some in next time she made them.   

That apparently was the necessary push.

I bought them an all edge brownie pan as a wedding gift.

So.. what's already a part of your relationship that you love?  Not necessarily love most, or love best, but that is an example of why you want to marry her?   Make a list and see if any of those elements of your relationship lend themselves to a proposal that's uniquly yours."

Letterstothor,atheism,1390720283.0,"I disagree. Love is generally seen as good, not evil. If we are to argue this, we have to agree that even though they may be human concepts, good and evil are quantifiable objectively.

 The god asked for a sacrifice of Abraham, something so extreme that it would go against his nature. Abraham loved his son. His god asked him to kill him BECAUSE of his love for him, even though he supposedly knew the outcome. That is evil. Even if he didn't know the outcome, it's abhorrent to ask that of someone.

The point isn't that the act is evil, but the god is evil.

Edit: Your statement about the qualities I listed not being exclusive of omniscience is true. My point was that an omniscient deity needs to test nothing, because it needs no proof. The test of Abraham means that his god is not omniscient."

I don't know about the way the dialect is 'transcribed' in the OP tbh since i'm not super experienced in AAVE, myself.

To an extent, but lets be honest here, people are shallow and looks are a big part of the 1st impression/initial attraction. 

For example, lets say he's stuck in the rung where the amount of effort to attract a woman he's also attracted to is not worth it. To make it sound simpler, he's a 3. With a bit of working out and grooming, maybe bumps him a 1-2 points, which brings him to a 5. If he feels a potential SO at a similar attractiveness level as him to not be appealing enough, than he would gauge the amount of self-improvement put in to be a waste.

Same as my position (where as I'm un-attractive enough to where ""improvement"" would be a VERY significant investment of time and not to mention money for new clothes, cosmetic surgery, and orthodontia work), though b/c I love masturbation, porn , and muh anime women, I am not considering checmical castration.

* tell her its *absolutely okay* for her to seek help! sometimes we get into situations where we want to handle it all ourselves (or in her case just between you two) but sometimes we do need outside help, and this is one of those cases. I'm sure you two could find a therapist that could help her overcome these negative attitudes (these are gonna be stubborn mental blocks). a therapist can help her in conjunction with you, but there are things therapists can do cause they're, well, therapists.

* I'm sure you have already, but you must be gentle, patient, and willing to help her through this. tell her that you want to help her through this cause these attitudes are unhealthy to have; she's married to someone who loves her and cares about her pleasure (you), not to that jerk she dated

* tell her you love being intimate with her and want her to enjoy it, too, but again, you much be gentle. definitely keep up the relationship and intimacy outside the bedroom cause that will help smooth your path in the long run.

* for sexual things, maybe try making it to where *shes* in control. maybe that'll help her overcome these negative associations and attitudes, but take it slowly! don't pressure her into doing too much at once

* keep encouraging her and tell her that you'll get through this together (with outside help, of course)

KaNugget,atheism,1390720836.0,"Why race is a social construct (there are no differences between the races other than phenotypes and genetic predisposition to certain genes that are more common among a group) African Americans in this country have been set up in a hard starting position, on average, in comparison to other races, such as European Americans who immigrated here long ago. 

African Americans were slaves. When slavery was abolished they had no homes, were often arrested for vagrancy (where they'd be sent to a labor camp, thus basically enslaved again) had little inheritance to pass down, and basically had little means to get themselves or their family out of this situation. This situation turned into a endless cycle. African Americas would often move into black neighborhoods, due to Jim Crow laws that prevented them from live in the same neighborhoods of whites, even if they could afford to do so, had a much harder time voting until the 1960s, so the law was often not behind them, and still to this day are the victims of racial discrimination. 

Race is a factor in education, income, obesity, etch. Because of these reasons. However African Americans are not predisposition to be poor, uneducated or obese; they can get lucky, escape the likely scenario of joining a gang or ending up in prison (which we all know contains a disproportional representation of blacks) or any of the number of factors that would keep them in the endless circle of poverty, get a good job, perhaps an education, wealth, thus having a family that is already born into situation of wealth and health. Also there are a number of white and other races that are born into poverty. 

See, race is not a casualty because of biology, but African Americans are disproportionally affected by the social issues discussed above, so it is a casualty via socialization. "

That's because Plants Vs Zombies is not a Facebook game. It was a standalone game from PopCap long before they put it on Facebook. That game was originally a PC puzzle game and it's been pimped to every platform possible.

REAL Facebook games, like the various Sagas and Villes, have no real gaming value and are not actual games. They are essentially gambling devices at best or at worst exist solely to perpetuate their own fame in the hopes that reaching a critical mass will provide a userbase large enough to pay their extortions, er, sorry, ""micro transactions"" to progress faster (see: Farmville's bullshit hijacking of users' feeds to stuff notifications into all their friend's feeds).

GayLubeOil,TheRedPill,1390720928.0,I think we are all coming at this from the wrong approach. Immortality is the ability to live in in other people's minds long after your body is gone.

Maintain eye contact with the lesbians as the air horn sounds. Then leave. After that the lesbians and thier friends will never forget you and you will be immortal.
Thjoth,jobs,1390720932.0,"Move somewhere that actually has work (you could probably even find work that's somewhat related to your field in the areas that are booming right now) and continue to freelance in your field as best you can with your existing contacts in the city.  Build up a savings so you aren't risking homelessness and/or starvation, add to your portfolio, and then try NYC again in a few years.  Your two main issues right now are getting any kind of income and making yourself even more marketable to the big positions in your field so that you're harder to pass up, and I see no reason why you have to chain yourself to NYC to achieve the second while you're living so precariously in terms of the first.

Besides, unless you need to physically be in NYC to do your freelance work, living in a boom town outside the city would be far easier financially anyway.  Lower cost of living combined with more readily available employment."

HelianthusPy,booksuggestions,1390721362.0,"I have no idea why the other girls are giving her crap for liking fantasy novels. To me it often seems like fantasy is more feminine than masculine(I know it is for both genders, but I've personally seen more women read fantasy than men.)


An old favorite is *The Two Princesses of Bamarre*. It's still a favorite. I go back and read it every now and again. It does have a dragon in it though.

I'll agree with the others on the Tamora Pierce books too, as well as *Ella Enchanted*.

*Julie of the Wolves* is an oldie but goodie. Not quite sure if it qualifies as fantasy, but it's about a girl who runs away and ends up living with and learning to understand/communicate with a wolf pack.

Oh, and *The Golden Compass* is a good one too. It's a little darker though, if I remember correctly. But most definitely in the fantasy genre without being high fantasy.

All of the ones above contain strong female characters as leads, as well as supporting characters. If you want any descriptions, just ask. I'd be happy to give them.

~~~~~~~~~~~

For a couple good suggestions that don't have female leads(but do have strong female characters), *Artemis Fowl* and *Eragon* were both favorites of mine when I was that age. The first *Artemis Fowl* is pretty stand alone, but *Eragon* isn't.

Again, while not having a female **lead**, another good one in the fantasy genre is *Warriors*. It is a series, but the first book is stand alone. It also does not contain magic in the traditional sense, but it's definitely fantasy since it's about tribes of warrior cats.

~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are still stuck, there are TONS of fantasy novels in the teen/young teen section(usually tucked away in a corner of the kids' books) of most book stores. Especially Barnes and Noble. That's where I've come across most of the choices I'm offering you. Although, this was about 10-15 years ago. I have no idea what might be in there now."

Correct, and these missions will be denoted as swirling green nodes along with the INFESTATION enemy type. Infested are also available to fight at any time in the OROKIN DERELICT maps.

&gt; And does this ever change?

This does not change. This is the new system that DE has implemented to allow the Infested to be more like their intended ""Floodlike"" nature, rather than being part of the system.

There have been a few criticisms of this system, most prominently [in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1sv0mb/bring_back_the_infested/). But for the most part, it's not too hard to find an Infested mission if that's what you're going for.

I'll assume you know it for the remainder of this comment.

Mastery Rank isn't really a necessity to get the most enjoyment out of the game past around 9 or 10. The extra weapons or frames from past events and exclusive deals are not substantial enough to put later players at a Mastery disadvantage. There are enough lower Mastery weapons and Warframes in the game to reach the necessary amount of Mastery for the higher tier.

**TL;DR:** Mastery Ranks don't mean much other than allowing you to build certain weapons, and even then the highest cap is 9 or 10 at most. Past that, it's just a number."

[Republican factoid #3](http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/291601-poll-majority-of-republicans-call-global-warming-a-hoax).

I'm sorry, but respect for one's views is not a right. It must be earned. I believe you have a right to believe whatever you want, but that doesn't mean that I respect the views. I will not respect views or perspectives that are based on misinformation, I will not respect views that seem based on anything other than some form of reason or facts, or are flat out wrong. 

Your views are only as good as what can be defended, and as far as I'm concerned, the republicans' views are largely not defendable if you're not some rich guy looking out for your interests. 

Truth is not a democracy. Pointing out to a large portion of your population believing something has no basis on whether it's actually true. People used to believe the world is flat, but that doesn't mean anything if it's not true. People used to believe the sun revolved around the earth, but that doesn't mean anything if it's not true.

Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but I think that my main point still stands, and I will defend it unapologetically. If you believe Obama was not born in the US, you are WRONG. Period. if you believe that global warming is fake, you are WRONG, period. if you believe that Obama was not born in the US or that he's a marxist or something, you are WRONG, period. if you believe the female body ""shuts that whole thing down"", you are WRONG, period. If you believe trickle down economics actually works over the long term, you are WRONG, period. If you believe hurricanes are a punishment from God because we allow abortions and homosexuality, you are WRONG, period.

This is not even taking into account how many times the GOP has shut down the government or come close to doing it. The massive amounts of obstructionism. Etc.

The modern republican party is intellectually bankript and embarrasses itself at every turn. This is not to say that the democrats are perfect. This is not to say that the republican party has always been this way. This is not to say everyone who votes republican or even that every republican politician necessarily follows the stereotypes I mentioned in this and other posts (I can name a few conservatives I still have some respect for if I had to). But the current party is taken over by radicals, and I really don't feel like the average republican voter is really informed, especially given their apparent scientific illiteracy based on the articles I already linked."

I was desperately trying to get some studying done in a coffee shop (my jackass roommate makes it impossible at home) and a little kid at the table next to me really wanted to read her parents a ""bedtime story"" so she insisted that they close their eyes. It was admittedly kind of cute the first time she asked them. But mommy and daddy wouldn't close their eyes for whatever reason, so she kept screaming ""CLOSE YOUR EYES! I WON'T START TILL YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES!"" over and over again... for more than **TWENTY MINUTES**. I know because I actually timed it. That's how bad it was.

Orelle,infj,1390722310.0,"I think about it most days, knowing full well I wouldn't do it because of all the hurt it would cause others. And I carry a decent fear of lost potential; I don't expect I'll achieve anything objectively great, but I don't want to remove the possibility that I may help someone *else* achieve something great. Or multiple someone elses, who knows? As INFJs, we're attuned to the future and want it to be bright — and let downs are especially hard. But those are the times we need our idealism and motivation to carry us forward more than ever. 

I've done extensive reporting on transportation, and I've encountered a major issue — suicide by train. I sympathize deeply for drivers (who have their mental health rocked by the experience) and riders who witness an incident (and are delayed by it). But I understand why some people succumb to such a violent, public death. I know what it's like to stand at the line, stare into the lights and think, ""I could board this train, go to work and have another day like every other, or I could jump in front of it and worry no more."" Some days I believed jumping was the better option, but I told myself, ""this too shall pass,"" and let it.

A dear friend of mine died when I was at a tender age, and I simply couldn't handle it. I didn't understand why they were gone and I was still here. It felt unbearably wrong to me, but suicide wouldn't fix it. Somehow, I think I mentally resolved that 'wrongness' via disassociation. I had other problems, but that was the last straw. I felt like a ghost, gliding everywhere, watching, not participating in the world. I was nothing — life was weird. It seemed dream-like, as if I was looking at it through foggy goggles. You could have probably thrown a rock at me and I would have just slowly looked toward you. I didn't feel and I couldn't cry. 

It took me about three years to snap out of that trance. I barely remember those years, but I know my life was instantly better once I 'came back to life' and starting connecting with people again, engaging with my environment and enjoying learning, even from the bad times and mistakes. It felt good to cry again. And, coming from where I'd been, I felt pretty free; if you care little for yourself, you're like a berserker, you can go anywhere and do anything. That could be a problem, or a gift. 

I still tend to feel removed, like an intruder who occasionally gets reminded she's not invisible — something I've talked about before — but I'd rather be here, trespassing usefully, than gone by whatever method, be it disassociation, addiction or death. There's more point in 'being,' and being the best you can, while you can, than 'not being,' when you could be, and are. We need good people. Please stay, as long as you can. "

&gt;Bringing somebody else in the group down to look better yourself.

These strategies are immoral because they cause harm. This is a totally different question from whether or not they are amoral. 

For something/someone to be amoral, they must be indifferent to whether or not they cause harm. Saying that sexual strategy is amoral is not saying very much: it is just saying that what gets you sex in practice is not necessarily the same thing as being nice and is not intrinsically wrong. 

However, the fact that some things in life may work in amoral ways does not suffice to demonstrate that people in general are amoral. In particular, regard for oneself is moral. 

For example, if I claimed that the best way to reduce rape was to exterminate alphas as potential rapists, you would likely object. This is a moral position. In order to be consistent, if you have this objection, you must allow that immoral strategies should not be used.  

And being inconsistent in one's application of morality is not amorality. It is evidence of humanity.     "

I actually had a friend who had to take the pill, and had to pay tons of money for the brand name because the generic wouldn't work for her but her insurance wouldn't cover the brand name.

By the way, the reason my friend needed the pill was not for birth control. She was actually a lesbian, and therefore had no possibility of getting pregnant. She needed it because her periods would last 2-3 weeks. I'm a virgin and know I will not have sex until I'm in a relationship with a committed relationship with a man for at least a few months (and I'm currently single) but I'm on birth control because my hormones are so screwed up and my period was so painful that I would often miss school back in high school and use to have terrible mood swings. Also there's the case of that woman, can't remember her name, who lost part of her ovaries due to cancer because her insurance company wouldn't pay for the birth control that would have stopped it.

Is this a thing that you can actually say to another person and not feel a sour taste in your mouth afterwards? Love is an abstract thing. It's definitions are as varied as the day is long.

Also, problems with ambiguity probably stem from our unprecedented access to information and the pace we now live our lives at. Modern society demands so much from us, that any moderately successful person must be very forward-thinking and good at laying plans and anticipating issues. There's not a lot of room for ambiguity when you've got live like this, scheduling every waking hour of your life.

The only real solution is to watch out for it and spray them with water once or twice or let them wade in VERY shallow water for a few minutes to get the skin to loosen. There are also sprays that are very specific and non-harmful lubricant that could help. I've had to use some of that before as well.

Otherwise, if it happens again and you don't see any skin, take your gecko to a vet or call a vet or something similar. I can't think of any other normal reasons that such a thing should happen, but I am NOT an expert. I've just done a lot of reading to prepare for owning my gecko. c:"

banana-tree,Turkey,1390723193.0,"&gt;The US was also authoritarian during Washington's rule--yet you don't talk about them as authoritarian

You'll notice that I don't talk about them *at all*, despite you trying to bring it up. Because it's not relevant. Because the description of authoritarianism isn't comparative. And once again, it's not synonymous to ""evil"", and I don't use it that way. 

&gt; Great, so what is your objective when you go around calling CHP authoritarian?

To describe their rule accurately.

&gt;Surely they had authority, as any democracy does. But they were not an authoritarian state.

Hah. You know full well that ""they had authority"" is not what's being discussed here. Of course they were an authoritarian state. And I'm not (just) referring to the fact that they were the only party. They had to build a new 'nation' with a brand new identity. They had to build a new intelligentsia. They had to make radical changes in almost every area. They had a vision, and people had no alternative. The state dictating such changes necessitates authoritarianism. ""Authoritarianism"" here is descriptive, regardless of the direction of those changes.

&gt;And the democratic pogroms against Greeks, the real suffering that begun in the 1950s, does not upset you? Adnan Menderes' rule doesn't upset you

You reach that conclusion how exactly? Do I not get to be upset about both?

&gt; He didn't oppress minorities. The CHP did not do this. If you're thinking of rebel Kurds or rebel Islamic cults in the region, then you are forgetting that they were committing insurrection on a brand new state that was trying to keep its territory in tact.

Would you like to tell me how the wealth tax, also, was necessary because the government needed the money, and hey, what could we do but tax the minorities manifold according to ethnicity if they seem richer? And what to do but take them to labor camps if they can't pay off their debt even if they sell everything? It was all *necessary*. Don't I dare say CHP oppressed minorities. Alrighty."
asoiaflover,Pokemongiveaway,1390723196.0,"Depends on what kind of Togekiss you eventually want. Btw, Togepi is a baby pokemon, so you need to make him a Togetic to breed him first.

You probably want a Togekiss with Serene Grace, which is the second ability, the second ability will show up randomly which is good, once you get one with the ability you want and a few IVs (breed your 6IV I gave you with the 3IV Ditto I gave you, or the 3IV Togetic I gave you), give one of them the Destiny Knot, that should give you eggs that have 4 - 5IV (possibly even another 6IV), and release all the Togepis that have the wrong ability.

The other thing you have to think about is nature. Decide what nature you want your Togepi to have. Look on smogon to find out what is a good nature for your Togekiss to have. You will either have to find a Ditto with that nature, or another pokemon in the same egg group and breed it with a female Togetic, and give the pokemon with the correct nature your Everstone, that will guarantee all the babies have the nature. 

After you get a Togepi with the nature and ability you want, and a few IVs, the next thing is just to keep breeding. Get like 20 eggs hatched, take them to Kiloud city and check with the IV checker to see what IVs they have. Every time you get a Togepi with the correct ability and more IVs than your breeding Togetic, evolve him to a Togetic and replace him with the Day Care. You will eventually get another 6IV Togepi, but this one will have the proper ability and nature. 

If you want egg moves, you'll have to look at the Smogon or Pokemon Database and see what egg moves you can have, and what parents you have to find that have those moves. It can be really complicated but there are guides to help you.  

Does that all make sense?"

The shield becomes dysfunctional, building towards their invertible break up.  Roman Reigns has speared every man in the ring and it is awesome.  Reigns man handles Ambrose and tosses him over the top rope.  Rollins runs full speed at Reigns and is greeted by the super hero punch.   Reigns lifts him up in power bomb position and takes it towards and over the ropes.  Rollins hangs on, in a head scissors position.  Punk runs up and eliminates them both.

e46 m3 - can be found for 15k but maintenance is very important.

clk 55 amg or cl 55 amg - another good lux/speed combo can be found for 10k

Mitsubishi 3000gt vr4/nissan 300zx tt - both of these cars can be made stupid fast, that being said you could buy one for 5k~ and pay a shop to build them up. Could smoke all the porsches, etc in a strait line. 

subaru gc8 with sti swap - seen these on craigslist going for 15k, can be a blast to drive.

FD rx7 - can find decent examples for 15k and they look and drive awesome

Most of these cars will require quite a bit of attention. Remember to follow routine maintenance to prevent any major issues.

It all depends on what you want, if you wanna smoke your classmates get a 3000gt, if you wanna fit in get a clk 55 amg or the e39 m5. If you like driving get an e36/e46 m3, rx7, or sti swapped gc8. Just don't rush into a car take your sweet time."

When we all went for the pre-dance dinner, my friend pulled me into the bathroom freaking out because she had forgotten to get my crush a boutineer.  Thinking it would catch my crush's attention, I sacrified my corsage to be ripped into one singular flower to pin on his lapel.  She promised she'd pay me back in some way, and I also held out hope that my friend would come clean and tell my crush what I had done for her.  She never came clean and her big ""thank you"" turned out to be a bag of skittles.
I felt so bad about ruining my mom's thoughtful gesture that I left the dance early to go home and confess.

flyingcatpotato,AskWomen,1390723894.0,"I have some debt issues from my divorce which are temporary in nature.  I wouldn't say no to a guy who has finance drama similar to mine, but i would say no to a guy who has a lifetime history of financial mismanagement.  I also make quite good money so money is even less of a dealbreaker as long as the guy has a job. 

It is important to me that a guy be in good financial shape (not perfect just good) for me to project a future with him, but that bar for ""good"" is set really low: no debt, no problems staying employed, no money issues directly imputable to personality.  It doesn't sound like you or most guys would have a problem meeting those criteria. 

Are you sure money is the real dealbreaker here, or is it part of a bigger problem? For example, if you are meeting women who want kids, or you want kids yourself, have you gotten to the point about talking how finances would be dealt with in a kid situation? Do you have a lot of school debt from your studies that may freak some people out? Do you have any signs of conspicuous consumption that may lead people to make false assumptions about your priorities? 

Finally, i grew up in a medical family.  Being a doctor's spouse is not an easy way to live. Dealing with 100 hour weeks is not fun, money or no money.  Is your schedule such that you have time to build and nurture a relationship? Or are you so busy that the women you meet only see the advantages of being with ""a doctor""?"

I don't think a crowd noise of 137 decibels was legitimately acquired through only cheering, especially as compared to what they achieved in the NFC Championship game, arguably the most important home game in franchise history.  
You can't shift the responsibility onto GWR if the record is dishonest. It's not their job to monitor every speaker in the stadium for noise. Is it the IRS' fault if someone avoids paying their taxes?  
I don't doubt that noise causes false starts in Seattle. I do doubt that the noise is organic and not pumped in through stadium speakers.  
Never did I say I hate the fan base. Dislike != hate. I don't hate the Seattle fan base any more than you hate the 49er fan base.  
It goes without saying that I think the better team lost. I thought the refereeing was at times unfair and/or bad. I thought the 49ers outplayed the Seahawks.

I'm sorry that you aren't happy with the fact that personality isn't enough to get someone to be attracted to you, but it's honestly the truth. We live in a culture that does not find fatness or whatever as the most attractive, and that affects all people's perceptions of what is and isn't attractive. It's not that women are bad shallow whores or whatever the hell Internet misogynists preach, it's just that most people in our society - men AND women - are not initially attracted to fatness.

savoytruffle,AskReddit,1390724248.0,"I've had a lot of scars over the years but they seem to fade. Maybe they're not deep enough.

I suffered a deep wound to my eye socket once when I was about 4 years old. My mother was sorting out the laundry in her bedroom and my brother and I were spinning around, just exhilarating in new feelings like little kids do.

I got dizzy enough and whanged my head on the side of my parents' bed.

Blood everywhere.

My next memory is being in the car with my dad, a cold ice-packed wash-cloth next to my face. It's funny because in my memory he was my dad, but as I calculate it he was only about 3 years older than I am now.

Then I remember being in a doctor's office. Getting numbed for stitches. I didn't really understand what that meant.

But anyway now I have a subtle scar near one of my eyes. It seems different since instead of being another color, it's just an unusual dip in the skin.

Yes, I did make an effort not to say what side it's on. Maybe someday that will be handy."

If you're only gaming.

But if you're the type of person who leaves their computer on and runs things in the background you're going to need more ram. Or if you have more than 1 monitor you're going to need more ram. Or if you leave you're computer on you're going to need more ram.

I constantly have several things running in the background including a browser with pages and pages of tabs. Other applications including spotify, nzb client, word documents, skype, team speak, steam, origin, ftp profiles, ssh terminals, etc etc But I also have 3 monitors.

Truthfully the more ram you buy in kits the cheaper it gets per GB/ram. When I upgraded by computer I threw in 32 GB of ram for this reason.

Your measurements indicate somewhere around 44DD or E.  This probably sounds huge, as somehow society has got it into it's collected head that DD=hugeprobablyaugumentedpornstarbazoombas.  This is just not the case.  [Here's a collage of real D and G cups.](http://i.imgur.com/z9PGMnP.jpg?1) [NSFW].  I know the types of bras are not what you're looking for, but as you can see, it's really a pretty modest cup size.

You'll notice the differences in  cup size between bands in that graphic, and that's because cup size is not static, it's a ratio.  So a 44DD has the same volume as a ~~36A, 38B, 40C, 42D, 46E, and 48F.~~ 48C, 46D, 44E, 42F, 40FF, 38G, 36GG, and 34 H.  (Don't worry if you never knew this, a remarkable number of longtime bra wearers don't either.) 

I'm guessing the gore (middle bit between the cups) on your current bra is not touching your chest, and the outsides of the wire are sitting on breast tissue.  Along with the too loose band (A new bra should always fasten snugly on the loosest hook, the others are for as the elastic wears out), these are all signs of a non-ideal fit.  I don't know how many times your worn it, but it's very likely that the wires will pop out and/or chafe the outsides of your breasts in time.

Also, if you're going to wear bras, particularly wired bras, it's a good idea to learn to out them on properly.  Lean over at 90 degrees, clasp the bra behind your back, and use your hands to scoop all the tissue you can into the cups.  This ensures the wires are not sitting on breast tissue, and can support you properly.

I think what you probably want is a [minimizer bra](http://www.barenecessities.com/44DD-Minimizer-Bras-Bras_catalog_nxs,31,size,1055,style,61.htm?cmp=savebig).  It basically flattens your profile, and pushes tissue back towards your armpits.  I don't know a huge amount about them, but your size is pretty commonly made and there ought to be a good bit of choice out there.  The link I linked up there is one website, there're a bunch more in the buying guide on the side.  

As for wire, it's really up to you.  Most of us prefer it vastly, because it does lift, support, and separate better, but as your goal with a bra is somewhat different, you can make that call on your own.  A well sized wire-free bra will feel better than a SML compression sports bra, for sure.

It's worth looking through the shape guide in the sidebar too, as that informs fit just as much as size, and particularly if you're shallow or conical.

Whew, I hope that wasn't too much information to throw at you all at once.  Hope it was somewhat helpful, anyhow!"
namesaremptynoise,AskReddit,1390724473.0,"I was working as a bouncer at the shittiest strip club in las vegas, at that point I was pretty self destructive anyway, drinking lots, smoking pot, smoking 3-5 packs of cigarettes a day, and, well, working at the shittiest strip club in las vegas.  One night the outside security guy came in and was talking about how he'd caught some hooker out in his shack(it let him watch the parking lot of the club and the toy store next door that was owned by the same people) snorting it and she'd run off so fast she'd left $20 and a little baggie of meth.  I told him to keep the money and i'd take the meth.  I'd done coke before so I just went into the bathroom and snorted it.

Holy shit was it life-changing for me.  It was better than coke and it lasted way, way, *waay* longer.  I was wired the rest of the shift and then for a while after I went home too.  I not only worked at a shitty strip club, I also lived in a shitty neighborhood where people had been trying to sell me drugs since I moved in, so I just started saying yes.

After that things get fuzzy for a while.  Almost a year went by when I was making good money but, surprise surprise, it all kept disappearing.  I got pissed about something and quit my job at the club and took a job working building security, then got laid off when they sold the building.  Eventually, the woman I've spent more than half my life being in love with, who, at that time was living across the country, called me and told me she needed me.  I knew she wouldn't want an addict, so I flew cross-country with my monkey checked in my overhead compartment and suffered through the withdrawls as best I could once I got there.

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,DesignMyRoom,1390724482.0,"I may not be totally understanding your rooms layout, so some of these comments may not make sense. Personally, I think it's ok to block some curtain. As long as it's not too much light. I don't understand the closet thing and how ti would be different from where your bed is now?

The food thing would be a problem. One possibly crazy solution is, if you are handy with building at all you could make [a long table that slides over the entire bed](http://www.houzz.com/photos/69427/jvw-home-modern-bedroom-austin). I would make it lower and longer (so it would slide the opposite way). It may be too big, but the thought would be if you had it long ways it would cut off you bed by like a third at least. And it would be come a soft table, so all drinks and food can be put behind you. Then lean some pillows on it  (like 2 long body pillows, and then decorative pillows on top) and that become where you couch starts so it's not quite so big. Also, depending on size, if the bottoms where on casters you could roll it out over the bed and store it against the far wall. Add a couple of stool and now you are a shallow breakfast bar table to eat at. 

Also [laptop tables](http://www.worldmarket.com/product/alemeda-laptop-table.do?camp=ppc%3AGooglePLA%3Anone%3A40004163899adwords_groupingLiving_Room_Tables&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;matchtype=&amp;gclid=CP6y6_iwm7wCFa10QgodHVoA9w) as awesome for drinks and snack because they can slide right up to the bed/couch. 

Your headboard might work. [These people made two corner headboards](http://courtneyhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/queen-beds-for-teenagerstwo-headboards-make-a-comfy-corner-daybed-apartment-therapy-s43nrizb.jpg) that looked kind of neat. Really depends what the style is. 

I also wonder if the room would work flipping the furniture? Like the bed against the biggest wall and the tv and dresser against the closet wall? May not but if you are bored it might be worth a try. 

Also, even with the futon, consider getting a heavy strong material blanket or sheet that you put on top of your real sheets and comforter for when it's in bed mode. Tuck that shit hardcore until all of the ends are underneath the mattress. Then, if your friends get crumbs or spill it will mess up the cover and not your bed.

Alfonze423,AskReddit,1390724611.0,"I'm a 20-year-old leader in a boy scout troop, the same one I joined when I was 10.  This past summer, I spent one day of a camping trip teaching survival skills to all but the oldest scouts, followed up with a cooking class for campfires.  Since I spent a considerable time working alongside these guys as a scout myself, and I'm the only adult in the troop under 40, they ask me a lot of questions about life.  I'm not as active with the troop anymore, now that I'm attending university year-round, so this night turned into a three-hour-long Q &amp; A session.  Keeping in mind these guys range in age from 10 to 17, this is a sample of the kind of questions I got:

What is high school like?  Is this class going to be hard?  Do you have a girlfriend?  What do I say to this girl I like?  What job do you want to have?  Is driving fun?  How hard is college?  Is root beer the same as beer?  Do you live on your own yet?  Why do the leaves change color in autumn?  What is cancer?  How does electricity work?  Do you have any cool stories from high school?  From college?

I've known most of them for 3 to 7 years, and I always try to be as honest as is possible (or reasonable) with them.  A ten year old can be surprisingly understanding of concepts that some adults don't get, even if it's just a general idea of the topic, and I've found that simply treating kids with dignity and respect when talking to them goes a long way toward earning their respect.

Anyway, as the ten of us are just sitting around the fire watching it slowly die out, one of the younger guys turns to me and says, ""Alfonze423, I want to be like you when I get older.  You're really cool.""  Another one agrees with him, saying, ""Yeah, and you're smart and you always help people, too.""  The whole group pretty much agrees with them.

Let me pose a certain moral dilemma though to demonstrate a point of conflict I see between many. 

Most people I see look down on flaunting/bragging about wealth/income or even lying about it. That is easy to think about, because there's little moral dilemma or conflict between the three major approaches to normative ethics.

More contentious: I have in the past seriously considered under-reporting or at least hiding my income on OKC for many reasons, a couple of which.

- Reading OKC trends, I see that most people lie about their income, and I felt embarrassed to possibly put myself in that class (the higher income groups are vastly overrepresented).
- I had a naive desire to find people who care for me for immaterialistic reasons; i.e. avoid gold-diggers / superficial people, as you said.

Most people I know would actually be OK with that kind of dishonesty once I provide the above two reasons. 

These people operate under **virtue ethics**. It's not the act itself, but what it says about one's character and moral behaviour. It's easy to think this way because it coincides with emotions like fear/anger, distrust/trust, etc.

Lying in the first case (flaunting, bragging, lying by overrepresentation) draws suspicion, distrust, dislike. Lying in the second case is more sympathetic, draws less hate.

There's a hint selfishness in the fact that the first kind of lie takes away from the rest of us (someone gets tricked into getting less than what she bargained for), while the other kind of lie gives more to the rest of us (someone gets tricked into getting more than what she bargained for).

Not just selfishness from the liar, but selfishness from everyone else. Why should a lie be OK in one case but not the other? Only because everyone else only feels threatened by one case and not the other.

Here, this is in greatest contrast to deontological ethics, in which case both forms of lies are unacceptable barring mitigating factors (e.g. threat, force, etc). Someone who follows this kind of philosophy would disagree with your statement: 

&gt; Basically, if it is an outright lie or harmful to the other party, I probably think it's immoral.

The way you present this statement hints at virtue ethical thought. You are not even sure if this lie is immoral or not. You *probably think* it's immoral, because you don't judge the action so much as how it reflects on his overall character (which you don't have a clear enough picture of and might never). It's fraught with ambiguity. 

Applying this line of thought more broadly to this thread:

I mentioned before that a frequent point of ambiguity comes from ""*discussion of strategy*"" vs ""*acting on strategies*"". I see feminists and other sociologists frequently condemn people even for discussing things (without inciting action).

By virtue ethics, it makes some sense, because virtue ethics focuses less on actions themselves and more on how they reflect on moral character. 

""He's must be a narcissist.""

""He sounds like he'd be manipulative.""

""Why would he want to talk about these kinds of things? Something must be wrong with him.""

""Only someone truly dangerous would find this topic interesting.""

""I see signs of sociopathy from this post.""

The inner sociologist/psychologist in these people come out and they unload their entire vocab/knowledge to analyse them by their posts, making judgment on their character.

People who follow different moral philosophies, such as deontological and consequentialist ethics (out of the three major normative ones), focus more specifically on actions/results. In this case, the action is really just posting on an internet forum about interpersonal strategies.

Here, discussions are mostly amoral with few exceptions. It's similar to how we allow freedom of speech with certain exceptions (""clear and present danger"" / explicitly inciting violence)."

Thjoth,jobs,1390724711.0,"Yes, I read your post.  Your first concern was that you couldn't find a job in your field, and your second was that you couldn't find any job, of any kind, at all.  75% of all the work that exists on planet earth for your field is in the city for whatever reason.  Frankly, if your ""newspaper journalism"" field is that small, that constricted, and that hard to break into, and you've already suffered one layoff, it sounds like one of the journalism subfields that will no longer exist in 20 years thanks to the internet, but that's just my impression without really knowing about it.

I have no idea how you have been living in NYC with no job for two years (I'm guessing living with your parents or some very clever arrangement of roommates to ease the gaps in your freelance stuff), but you're going to have to face the prospect that if things continue the way they are, you ARE going to be on the street.  For real.  Put your war face on or you're legitimately going to be homeless, period, end of story.  This is not a light matter.

So, you need to achieve two goals. First, and most importantly, secure an income, preferably equivalent to 40 hours of minimum wage a week at the very least.  Second, continue working towards breaking into your field.

The first is straightforward: apply at every single place seeking employees that you see for the next six months.  Make it your goal to fill out at least five applications a week. It doesn't matter what it is (well, it does, just don't do anything illegal or otherwise unsavory), whether it's bagging groceries or cashiering or retail or whatever.  If, in six months, you still haven't gotten a job, it's time to abandon the city and go somewhere with actual job opportunities *or you might legitimately fucking die.*

Second, continue doing what you're doing to try to break into your field.  Again, give it six months to see if there's a breakthrough, but if it becomes obvious that's a completely impenetrable dead end before that point, try attacking it from a different angle.  If, after giving it some time and different approaches, you still haven't gotten anywhere, you need to write that narrow field off and try separate, but related, fields.  Expand your focus while keeping it related to your original field.  *You can't help it if your field is a dead field with no work.*  If you think creatively, and widen your focus, you should be able find something at least somewhat closely related.

At some point you're probably going to have to get creative with your professional knowledge and create the opportunities for yourself if there are none.  You're also going to need to be unafraid to unchain yourself from the city with such few job opportunities and astronomical cost of living.

flyingcatpotato,AskWomen,1390725185.0,"My ex husband was a textbook abuser, the emotional abuse was unrelenting and the physical abuse common, i lost hearing in one of my ears. Every day he had something to complain about, i would get beaten for missing a corner of dust on the back of the tv table, he would complain about my cooking, i never did anything right, ever.  Most of the professionals i have talked to also believe he probably has narcissistic personality disorder. 

In a lot of ways (as some of my posts show) i am still not over it.  Three things have helped:

Therapy.  I have talked to psychiatrists, psychologists, friends, doctors, religious professionals, everyone about what happened and how hurt and damaged i have felt.  Professional help- the psychiatrist was the best- is probably what stopped me from suicide. Thanks to therapy i have the tools to make it through the day and live my life.  Complaining about him on reddit also helps- my friends have already paid their agony aunt dues, and it is a way to get out all the little things that still piss me off even now.

Time.  Time is the biggest helper for me.  Just trying to survive and letting each day happen makes the pain a little less. It gets better if you let time just do its work. The passage of time has also allowed me to accomplish things personally that give me self-esteem. One example is that i passed a very difficult professional exam that i found out later his had mistress failed. I moved to a new city and got a new job after we divorced. Just having the strength to do that and being able to look back on how much time has passed has been very healing.

Finally, having a normal SO.  I do believe in justice, and that because I had the worst husband in the world, the universe gave me a SO who is his total opposite. It took me a lot of therapy to want a relationship again and be in the right place emotionally to be a good girlfriend. I had learned a lot of bad habits in my marriage, namely tuning out my ex. All he was churning out was invective and abuse so i had to just for self-preservation, but in a normal relationship you have to listen to what your partner is saying.  Just being able to live and love in a normal relationship has helped me feel normal so much.  Because my SO is a good guy, there is no more victim dynamic in my relationships, i am responsible for how i treat him.  It sounds simple and strange but having a power balance that is normal is the most restorative thing in the world.

Like i said, i probably complain more about my ex on reddit than i do in real life, but it will take time before my emotional scars heal.  All i can do is survive and while i am not there yet, i am proud of the steps i have taken to get there. "

I'm quite sceptical, because now 14 out of 20 drivers have 5 years or less experience, which will not show a lot of battles. But Mercedes bought Lewis because of that first V6 season and Ferrari are also relying on the biggest changes in so many years now that I really would love to see battles between Nando, Kimi, Seb and Lewis. 

This is the Red Bull vs. Ferrari vs. Mercedes season. So....3 out of 10 teams with chances of making something interesting. I'll go with skeptical."

Thachiefs4lyf,assassinscreed,1390725520.0,"I accidentally played the series starting with 2 then going back to 1 then replaying 2 and continuing in normal order so that might've effected my review but:

* ACI- repetitive doing all of the tracking missions, good idea but it was the same thing over and over. Good modern day story,means they couldve taken it anywhere, the fighting was a bit funny an I don't think it worked to well. Really established that the templars think they are doing the right thing. The world was to big and empty. 7/10 going to have to go least favourite not because it did anything wrong but because it did get repetitive

* AC2- The world was a large improvement on I mainly because there had lots of hidden collectables(glyphs etc), probably my favorite modern day storyline as whenever you came out of the animus there was stuff to do. Fighting was better than ACI but still trowel it's and unexciting, the options of holding hostages was good though and I always fought with daggers, the assassin tombs were nice to run around in. 7.5/10 2nd worst again not because of anything wrong but because the other games improved greatly on it.

Sorry OP but it would take an age for me to type the rest out on phone so I'll give quick summaries.

* ACB 8/10 lots of collectables glyph returned good game added combos which made fighting more exciting but easier 1st equal modern day had nothing much in it but was good to run around as Desmond.

* ACR 7.5-10 hookblade was a wonderful idea sadly I feel it coulee been used better in one of the other ezio cities first tower defence sucked 4th best because of how much it enjoyed playing around with the hookblade.

And sorry op bit I give up

Edit: best/worst

Game: ACIII and ACB tied/ACI

Assassin: Ezio/Edward

Assassin I liked exploring and roaming with: Edward and Connor/Altair

Location/timeline: USA/The crusades

Weapon: close rope dart would've been first but you don't get it till the end of ACIV and it would've been great hanging people on the pirate ships but tomahawk due to the bloddy mess it wrecked/all those different bombs I was required to use in ACR"

A throwaway? Fuck it. I want to help not conceal. 

I am a closeted gay/bi but leaning-more-towards-to-male man. I have been in the same position as K has been before. Almost exactly. ODing on various prescription drugs; including Benedryle and Mucinex. Being busted on watching gay porn also.

I want to start this response with the fact that you, K's girlfriend, is an amazing human being. Nearly anybody on this earth would not react the way that you are doing, and by you reacting this way you have saved your SO's life. Being completely serious. 

My best guess is that he is indeed a closed gay/bisexual. You and I will never know until he admits the fact but that should not be inforced in anyway possible. Why? Because that is the reason of his depression. 

He feels guilty, scared and lonely.  He knows that he should not be in current position right now, as well as taking those pills and drinking that syrup. He KNOWS what he is doing is wrong, I am positive. He is not addicted, per se, but just seeking a way to exit his existence on Earth because he doens't want to be here. He ""knows"", which is a mistake, that if he ever comes out, you and his family will disown and leave him entirely. He wouldn't have anywhere to go. But he isn't happy with where he is at which is why he is taking those drugs. 

I have taken OD amount of Benedryle before... And I can tell you right now that it is NOT pretty. As a frequent recreational drug user, Benedryle high are and we're the worst high I have ever experienced. The body load as well as the delusion, hallucination and blood pressure are the dirtiest of dirty. I was actually quite surprised he is even alive, actually. 

How am I alive? By God's grace. But religion is not for everyone so I want to put that aside. What he needs the most right now is comfort. How do we provide that for him? I have no clear answer. However I have some ideas. 

When he gets out of his delirium which will take 2 days or so, and provide him a lot of fluids, explain to him how much you and his family are there for him. I don't know how to get it across to him and not allow him to feel any burden, but try your best. As well as not being upset at him will be the best. 

I would not mentioned the fact that you have found gay porn in his history. It will SCAR THE SHIT OUT OF Him. I promise you. I don't know how to deal with that point, honestly. I tell you that I don't know because I don't want to tell you some bullshit ""cure"" that I pull out of my ass. 

Just tell him you are there for him, and how much you care for him. Maybe tell him you guys support him too perhaps. 

I just wanted to leave this comment to allow you guys to understand just a little bit of what be is going through. Honeslty, I hope this doens't come across as assholeish, but you and your family will not be able to understand what he is going through. Because the pain of hiding, from your lover as well as your family, your serial orientation is a burden that even Satan is scared of. Sorry English isn't my first language, but honestly God bless. 

If you need any help PLEASE PM me I am willing to help you and your family through this scary yet hopefully happy ending situation. We just want everyone to be happy and alive. Not sad and dead. I will pray for you.

Basically, it's like Terraria *in space*!! You start off stranded on a planet with almost nothing, but by the end you can have tons of weapons, armor, mansions, whatever you can dream up. It's still early beta, which means character wipes are a regular thing to contend with and bugs are common, but it still managed to be quite fun in spite of that. I think that bodes well for the future of the game. Plus, the devs are pretty open about how development is going, and to player feedback (several popular mods have already been incorporated in to the base game). Overall I can't give a proper review, but I can say it shows a lot of potential and is already super fun."

This is the problem, though it goes both ways.  Plenty of women who'd be cool with a threesome would not be at all okay with their man having sex with another couple without them.  What you're suggesting is swinging, which is also fun but different than a couple+1 threesome.

&gt;to which I say, hypocrites!

Everybody's got fetishes and lines, just because they're not comfortable with an idea isn't a reason to call names.

&gt;The first couple to participate as a couple gives a lump sum to the other couple, which sum is returned when the woman from that couple reciprocates; if she does not, the deposit is forfeit.

...This is dangerously close to something that could get you arrested for solicitation or prostitution, or be used to scam people out of their money. 

&gt;Finally, the practice is sorely in need of a name. It's too complicated to explain every time. ""Attractive couple, 30s, seeks same for _____.""

The funny part is my mom isn't that religious. The only reason she's pissed that my brother is an atheist, I'm agnostic and my dad is non-religious is because she can't show her family off at church. In fact, she doesn't even go to church anymore because she's ""too embarrassed to show up without her family.""

Granted, our church is in the rich part of the city, but seriously, no one cares. 

We tell her if she wants to be religious that is her choice. But if she won't go to church because we won't, well, that's also on her.

They chose today of all days to reiterate the point that they aren't here to serve whom ever but as a hobby project that could be dropped at any time. Choosing today of all days allows their leaving to have a greater impact on the community in hopes that the community can better realize whats transpired and correct the wrongs that have been made.

Pahimar is also not leaving due to the drama that has been going on. He has family and a real life to attend to and as such, minecraft and gaming in general will always take a back seat to that. Im sure the Mrs. would like to have him back as well.

As for cloudy, yes, todays events didnt help but hes also stated he has enough going on in his real life that he doesnt need the extra stress of modding to be added to that. 

I want to thank all of them for their hardwork as it has lead to some great developments in the modding community. You've inspired many people to not only view the game in a different light but learn from it. Many people, myself included, have used minecraft as a medium to learn coding whether it was LUA in computercraft or Java from creating mods. Several mod devs created projects based around these mods simply because they were inspired by the original work and want to be a part of it.

codayus,feedthebeast,1390726768.0,"You can check his twitter feed; the answer is...nothing really.  He tweeted something ambiguous about how modders aren't allowed to use malicious code to try and keep control over how their mods are distributed and used, and if it's that big a deal to keep control over them, then they should just not release them publicly at all.

All of which is basically 100% fine, although the obvious comeback is ""well, what about copyright?""  Now the obvious assumption is that Marc_IRL was talking about Greg style ""if you install my mod with TCon I will crash your game"", in which case copyright has nothing to do with this whatsoever, in which case everything he said was correct and unobjectionable.

But a few people have decided that Marc_IRL was actually talking about the old FTB/Technic issue where modders try and control who can redistribute their mods.  Nothing he said was about that, but he *could* have been.  And in *THAT* situation, copyright is very relevant, and Marc_IRLs comments are incorrect.

And a couple of people have decided that actually, his comments weren't incorrect at all, but were actually a coded reference to super double-secret plants Mojang has to somehow steal ownership of all mods from the modmakers, the removal of all copyright protections, and in the extreme version of this theory, the enforced open sourcing of all mods.  Which is ...um.  Technically possibly, but *wildly* unlikely.

And then people who decided that Mojang was about to legally take ownership of ever mod started fomenting drama and having yelling matches with everyone else.  Cloudhunter, for example, believes that Mojang is asserting 100% ownership over all mods.  And again, Marc_IRL never said this, but what he did say was so ambiguous you can't prove he WASN'T saying that, and that's more than enough room for a Drama Storm(tm).

TL;DR:  Nothing; this is a tempest in a teapot sparked by a very mildly ambiguous tweet, but at this point the drama train has nothing to do with any actual events."

This is not something I thought about.  I was only thinking about *why* this person would be so manipulating (I think I've got that down well), but is a childhood friend a good enough reason to stick around someone when they become more of a ""frenemy"".  

google showed this: 

Frenemy


""Frenemy"" is a portmanteau of ""friend"" and ""enemy"" that can refer to either an enemy pretending to be a friend or someone who really is a friend but is also a rival. Wikipedia


Perhaps the person thinks the frenemy is a friend who is also a rival (but it is unclear what the case is till much later)"

Secondly, I think the censorship rules are a tad more relaxed. In this country we have the 9pm watershed. Before this, all TV has to be [at least somewhat] suitable for children and teenagers. After this, however, you can swear, show boobies, and basically allow the adults to watch the TV they've been yearning for all day.

I'm not a big Graham Norton fan, if I'm honest - I personally have never found him that funny, but the stuff that goes down on his show is pretty cool.

On the North America point, though - I do love The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, but I'd be a little worried if he went on to take The Late Show from David Letterman. Lots of his charm is centred around the fact that he's doing the best he can in a tiny studio that doesn't function completely as it should, and I feel that he's much better with a small audience."

You'd expect it to be a 50-50 thing, but it can be any ratio. If you lose the 'domminant' ovary then you become a lot less fertile, But through tracking cycles and symptoms getting pregnant is still easy if you are having sex at the right times. After several years the remaining ovary tends to realise its all up to them and it releases more often, You may skip a month here and there, but again, if you are trying to get pregnant, then the single ovary is not the real boundary, as even women with two are only fertile for one short window a month, and some women with two ovaries still skip ovulation some months because of stress or lifestyle."

Sounds like the best situation possible right? But I quickly because infatuated and hard! So one day after a social group gathering I get the thought I should find out where she lived. I knew it was close by but I didn't know exactly where.

Now at this point a normal person would simply ask the girl. We had been out a few times and she knew me so it wasn't an odd question at all. But I didn't want to be too obvious with my interest of her, so my brilliant teenage brain decided my best course of action was to follow her home. \*bet you can guess where this story is going*

Now unbeknownst to me, this girl was SUPER paranoid about being followed so she regularly checked for this sort of thing. So naturally, as I am not a super spy or private investigator I was spotted rather quickly. For a while she thought it was just a coincidence, but then we pulled into her neighborhood.

Back to my brilliant teenage brain, I soon thought ""Oh we are in her neighborhood now, she's more likely to notice me. I should turn off my headlights!"" Typically, this might not be a terrible idea if you were surreptitiously following somebody, however when you have already been noticed this is EXTREMELY conspicuous. 

So she sees my lights go out but still following about a block behind her, and naturally, she freaks the hell out. She calls her house and her mom wakes her step dad up saying someone is following her. She races home and runs inside. And you'd think that'd be the end of the story right? 

Wrong. I've never been able to justify what happened next in my brain. For some reason I decided that I should go to leave by turning around in her driveway. But as I do, her step dad bursts out of their house, baseball bat in hand and pulls me out of my car almost ready to beat me to death. Fortunately the girl came out and called him off once she recognized me. I then had to explain myself and what I was doing to her, her mom and her step dad in their front yard, in the middle of the night. 

We were engaged 6 months later. I'm honestly not sure how that happened. I've either got the luck of gods or mad game because somehow I recovered from that boondoggle and married that girl.

**TL;DR** I ended up stalking my future wife home in the creepiest way possible, got caught and almost killed. But then I ended up marrying that girl, so it turned out alright.

The problem with telling anyone your size is that if you say it's small, everyone will believe you no matter what, and if you say it's big, everyone will assume you're lying. So there really isn't a way to win, unless you're already certain you're going to bang the girl and use it as a surprise.

I'm wondering if it has something to do with Japanese used game culture, or rather a lack of it. Devs need to get more retail releases to get the sales they really want, so releasing essentially the same game twice is much more profitable and gets a bunch of used MH4 (Not G) copies in the hands of the die-hard's friends, or in the used game shops?

I think Japanese gamers are just used to paying premium prices to be gamers too, just seems to be the way it's always been there. So buying the same game twice isn't that weird to them...

As for fashion, good quality clothes also last a long time. But if you buy a pair of shoes for $20, then you shouldn't really say that they were ""designed to fail after three months""."

banana-tree,Turkey,1390728925.0,"What part of ""the description of authoritarianism isn't comparative"" was not clear? US has no relevance here. Neither do Saddam, Mubarak and Gaddafi.

&gt;But you allude to such situations when you use words like authoritarian.

No, for the third time, it's not synonymous to ""evil"".

&gt;You did this because of one reason: Because you wanted something to blame Ataturk for.

I didn't even bring up Ataturk himself. I'm talking about the ideology and the actual rule of the party. 

I brought this up as a reminder that trying to defend certain concepts, if it goes overboard, can lead to the non-factual statements. That's why the difference between 'not authoritarian' and 'necessarily authoritarian' was important.

To relate it back to the original subject, this is similar to the distinction between saying something wasn't genocide and saying that the government did everything right to the best of their ability.

**edit after your edit:** 

&gt; It is a democratic nation, where laws were voted on.

We currently have a democracy too, and laws are voted on, and I'd still call it authoritarian, despite there being an opposition. Democracy and authoritarianism aren't incompatible. Those laws that were voted on called for people who didn't wear hats to be jailed, as one trivial example. The key is the nature of the laws, not whether they were voted on. Opposition was scarce because it wasn't allowed to thrive, because perhaps that was necessary to keep the newborn state strong. The argument you're making is that every new democracy is authoritarian, therefore I shouldn't call CHP authoritarian. That makes no sense and is contradictory.  

&gt;Show me some sources on this.

Seriously? It's not even a controversial issue with contradicting sources. The law itself (which doesn't have the rates), the news on people being taken to (and dying at) labour camps, and arbitrary and disproportionate rates for non-Muslims are all out there  -- shouldn't be hard to find for a historian, but you can [check wiki first](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varl%C4%B1k_Vergisi). The PM of the time is on record saying ""With this we will remove the foreigners who dominate the market and hand the Turkish market to Turks"". You said you were fluent in Turkish, [here's another quote by him](http://godayva.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/f3e37-varlik-vergisi.jpg), talking about targeting ""guests who became rich by taking advantage of our hospitality"".

I'll also give you [the one article I've seen defending it](http://www.milliyet.com.tr/varlik-vergisi-ne-yeniden-bakin/ilber-ortayli/pazar/yazardetay/06.03.2011/1360504/default.htm) to make things easy for you, and even that's not much of a defence.

KaNugget,atheism,1390729466.0,"I agree and would prefer the government to presume alternative means, however it should be mentioned that it is the Christian right that is preventing them from making birth control and abortion more convenient and less costly. 

The government can't force a business owner to perform an abortion because he is not trained for abortion and due to his beliefs he would never chose to learn how to be a medical doctor that can perform abortions. However if this business owner owns a pharmacy then yes, I do believe he should be forced to descend plan b and birth control. Denying these products are not simply incontinent, they are socially damaging. I believe birth control is a right, especially because pregnancy can be extremely dangerous. It's one of the top 10 killers of woman in their 20s and 30s (I believe number 5). "

I suppose you might be able to use a diode to control a relay, with the main current going through the relay rather than the diode, but that introduces another couple of points of failure, and the parts would cost quite a bit more than you think."

Back on topic now. The douchebag that records these is from southern Oregon and goes to the more populated cities in Oregon to ""exercise"" his right. The only people that open carry in Albany are the people that own the gun shops but they only carry handguns and generally when they just get off work. The only crimes Albany really sees deals with meth, shoplifting, and the occasional burglary. Plus, this prick is in the downtown area where there are antique shops and your standard mom-and-pop shops. He only open carried there since a majority of the population has to drive through downtown to get to the big box stores on the other side of Albany."

I don't agree with all of it, but it will give you a decent picture of what most people mean when the say ""nice guy""

One thing to keep in mind is that while you don't want to be the ""nice guy"", that does *not* mean you shouldn't be nice.  Most women don't want a guy that treats them like shit.

An officer arrived and found that the man also had a pistol strapped on his hip. The man said he was exercising his Second Amendment rights. The officer counseled  the man, saying that he could alarm other residents. The Second Amendment advocate wasn’t receptive to this advice, suggesting that the general public and the Albany Police Department should be educated instead.

myiuki,sex,1390730894.0,"There are several tools that a therapist might use to help you and your partner through this difficulty. I can name a couple, but I'm not exactly trained.

Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy ([REBT](http://albertellis.org/)) is intended to help you think about why you do what you do. I suggest doing [this worksheet](http://www.stressgroup.com/ABCworksheet.html) about some of those thoughts that prevent you from relaxing.

Many people in /r/deadbedrooms have experience with various forms of checking out during sex, and while your situation may or may not be a dead bedroom, they might have information pertinent to your situation.

I know that you can't easily get to a therapist, but your next best bet could be reading [this account of a couple working their way through couples therapy in an effort to end their dead bedroom situation](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1w1g2b/indepth_diary_of_uk_sex_therapy_update_5/). They use [Sensate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensate_focusing) along with cognitive exercises to start becoming more comfortable exploring eachothers' bodies as well as to start communicating more openly.

With the trauma you've experienced, it can be difficult to be receptive of touch. Sensate can help you learn to accept this in manageable chunks.

&gt; In the first stage, the couple may touch each other's bodies excluding breasts and genitals. They are encouraged to enjoy and become increasingly aware of the texture and other qualities of their partner's skin. Intercourse is disallowed. Any focus on the genitals is not allowed. Participants concentrate on what they themselves find interesting in the skin of the other, not on what they think the other may enjoy.

Perhaps Sensate could act as [Desensitization Therapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_desensitization) for you?"

Why? Could be a lot of reasons. It's fun. He finds you attractive. Habit. Practice.

* @100 gas - Lair
* @100% Lair - 2 evo chambers, 2 gas, roach warren
* @100% evos - 1/1, roach speed, 6 overlords

Both builds lead up to a 1/1 speed roach timing - make roaches to 100 supply, another overlord and an overseer, and go. While hammering the terran's front or third (depending on what he has), drone up your own 3rd. Get 2/2, hydra den and infestation pit, and go for roach/hydra and then vipers if mech or festors if bio. Watch out for drops, make lots of static D and split your army until you have 3/3 and 200/200. Then try to win with that. The roach attack is absolutely not all in, though the terran will cry that it is - if it does nothing, I still win lots of the time (EDIT: provided of course that I don't lose all the roaches for nothing. Then I lose). If T has lots of marauders, bunkers, tanks and whatnot, just go home with the roaches and drone up your third - he can't do his 11 minute push because 1/1 roaches, he can't drop because roaches - remember that he had to make lots of defense, he's not ahead economically even though your third is empty.

The most common scenario is liftoff of his third and all the SCVs there die. I don't try to go up the ramp into his main unless it looks really, really bleak for him - I just drone up my 3rd and go for 3/3 roach/hydra with festors or vipers. He can only win with devastating doom drops now, and I am prepared for those. 

Might post replays later.

EDIT: a benchmark is that 1/1, roach speed and ~24 roaches should walk out at ~9:40, a bit earlier with the second version of the build"

Anyways, my 3rd table of the night comes in. 4 guys late 20's, 3 of whom sit at the table and one goes to the bar. I intercept and ask him whether he would like to order from the bar or have me serve him. He gets really excited and says he would prefer I serve them. I go to the table and all 4 guys are British. Alright... I'll admit I kind of kissed my tip goodbye and figured I'd just have a hell of a good time. I'm joking around with these guys all night, recommending beers and drink concoctions. 

Eventually they ask me where I'm from and I tell them I'm from Turkey. One of the guys taps me on the shoulder and says "" alright then Turkish"" to which I say "" what's next? You gonna ask me if I like ' dags ' and challenge me to a bare knuckle boxing match ? "" ( reference to the movie "" Snatch "" ) they are dumbfounded that I know the movie. 

We shoot the shit for a little more where they mention they work in the "" golf industry"" I ask them what are some good golf bags as I am looking to buy one for my boyfriends birthday, one guy says "" let us think about some suggestions while you bring the bill "" so I go get the bill and come back and they ask me for my email so they can send me some links and I give it to them and go in the back to give them privacy while they sign the bill. 

They tipped me $75 on $100, left their business card, and a note saying "" thank you for the greatest service we have ever had "" and about 20 min later I got an email confirming a order of a 368.00 pound ( as in the currency ) golf bag shipped to the restaurant.

mkvgtired,movies,1390732273.0,"&gt; Well, to be fair. We're everything American (and Canadian) redditors want to be and have.

&gt;Gay marriage, kinda legal weed, good and affordable healthcare, our worst ISP (UPC) would rank 3rd in the USA, many moneys invested in research, proper legal system that doesn't rely on 12 biast people, net neutrality law, violence is worse than nudity and sex and we speak better English than the average American

Gay marriage is legal in Canada, and for 42% of the US population (and federally), which is the same percentage as the EU. Both the US and Canada both outspend the Netherlands in research and development as a percentage of GDP [(US:2.7%, Canada: 1.8%, NL: 1.6%)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_research_and_development_spending). 

Two US states have legalized weed for recreational use and 20 states have legalized it for medical use. The pot for these programs is typically grown in the US. This is in contrast to the program in the Netherlands that forces retailers to purchase illegally imported weed to sell it legally. This allows for more involvement by criminal organizations because it necessitates illegal import.

Better internet services are being installed. My brother lives in a rural area with probably only a couple people per square kilometer. He has a 50 Mb/s connection. That said, it is much more difficult to connect a massive country with *very* low population density in parts than a tiny country with a very high population density.

All countries have court systems. Most legal decisions are not decided by the Supreme Court. That would be like saying all of the Netherlands laws are decided by the ECHR. 

I am not a grammar Nazi by any stretch of the imagination, but if you want to tout your English abilities while at the same time putting down others, you might want to learn how to spell. 

I like the NL, but your condescending comment seems like you're looking for karma more than a rational discussion."

&gt; If we are not meeting children’s needs and not presenting them with a format that suits them, we are not delivering to our customers

I wonder if they actually asked any children about this. If there are children who want to play 'no winners' rules then it seems obvious to let them. Similarly, if they don't, it seems bizarre to force them to change their game. The entire issue is easily resolvable if they simply bothered to ask the kids what they want."

The alternative is to live in a world where there aren't horrible monsters with assault rifles, where there aren't classrooms with the alphabet on the walls and tiny bodies on the floor, a world where none of that happened at all because it was all faked.  Instead of a bunch of dead kids and the grinning specter of chaos to try to make sense of, you have Them.  Good ol' arbitrarily evil Them.  You know what They're up to.  You're smart and you have an Enemy to fight and anyone that isn't your brother in this fight is either a dupe or a shill.  That's a lot nicer than trying to drink up a semblance of sense out of the fundamentally senseless, isn't it?

crankypants15,AskMen,1390734087.0,"&gt; What was sex like with them? 

It varies a lot, even among the ones who I think still needed more treatment. Some were mostly over it, some were not. For the ones who were not over it, in some cases it was clear she was unable to relax and enjoy the experience. And one had vaginismus, I think due to PTSD. 
She was awfully hard on herself when things didn't work the first time we tried. In fact this girl was going to immediately leave but she called a friend and the friend convinced her to stay. If she had left, that would tell me it would not work out, or she didn't like me at all. 

One girl, who wasn't totally over it, was great in bed, very expressive, and wanted me to be all kinds of dominant, including grabbing her neck. Another girl wanted me to be dominant but not grab her neck. 

If they need to wait to have sex they should know themselves about how long they need to wait and be honest with me. 
I can wait a bit if she's honest. 

Girl C was molested (once I think) and after 18 months, we only had sex 3 times, and that's when I ended it. We were clearly incompatible.

crankypants15,AskMen,1390734840.0,"1. How much do you work per week? Working too much can kill a relationship, but the specialists often only have to work 40 hrs per week. 
2. There will be a lot of people after your money. You should understand about healthy relationships and how compatibility works. And know what to look for. 

&gt; I was under the impression that women preferred a mate who was keyed in her senses, willing to understand her moods, dispensations, ideas and fears. 

True, but some women like guys who will call them on their BS when they take it too far. 

&gt; Unfortunately, I am getting the impression that having a car, material assets, credit cards, club memberships have more importance. Is it true for the women? Not all, but can that be generalized?

It's a very strong trend. They want what they grew up with, or better. Example: Many middle-class girls will want a much better house than they grew up with. IMO I prefer a strong farm girl who grew up poor. They never had money so they often don't think about it, instead they tend to focus on the relationship. But not all will.  I've had the best luck with girls who had strong family ties, because they didn't hate their family. I also look for a girl who doesn't put up with BS from family. Keeping family ties that are dysfunctional is not quite healthy. 

I also look for someone who can meet a challenge and come out smelling like a rose (emotionally). Example: a girl who takes care of her father with cancer for a year, who dies, she is sad, but ultimately deals with it in a healthy way. That's an impressive inner strength. 

As a former SAP I think you need to put aside your family goals for a few years, date a bit so you can learn how to have fun and manage relationships. This takes practice. Books will give you the basics but practice is really important. You wouldn't put a surgeon in the operating room without a lot of supervised practice, would you?

lana-del-boy,AskReddit,1390734980.0,"That's assuming that everyone gets £9000 in loans. In reality it's more fuzzy then that; the Student Finance company gives people a combination of repayable loans and non-repayable grants. How much of your money is a loan v. how much of your money is a grant depends on your parents income (unless you register as independent or you're a mature student.)

In Wales the Welsh Assembly gives every domiciled student a tuition fee grant, so that tuition is effectively only £3,500-ish a year. Scottish students studying at Scottish universities don't pay anything at all.

When it comes to repaying what you owe, the Student Finance loans are vastly different from normal loans. I heard someone refer to them as a ""graduate tax,"" because they work more like an additional tax than a loan. 

They don't affect your credit rating, and you only have to start paying them back when you're earning over £21,000 a year (£15,000 if you started university before Sept. 2012.) You repay 9% of however much over £21,000 (or £15,000) a year you earn. If you die, the loans are wiped. If you have not repaid your loan 30 years after you begin repayments, it will be wiped.

Also, I have no idea where you got the £56,000 figure from? [This article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/student-finance/9740974/English-students-in-twice-as-much-debt-as-rest-of-UK.html) states that the estimated average amount of student debt for students who began their course after Sept. 2012 is £43,500 for English students, and between £22,000 and £25,000.

After finding out where she lived, I went to my local shopping centre (mall for you Americans) and bought a nice little necklace with a love heart on. I then grabbed my friend and we marched to her house, I ran and hid while I got him to knock her door and say I got that necklace for her. He said no.

So I got some courage, went to her door and her dad answered. I was like, ""Is Stacy there?"" and he said ""yes"" and went and got her. As soon as she came, I was like, ""hey, I followed you home today to find out where you live because i fancy you and i got you a necklace because i love you so will you go out with me"" (all fast, no breathing) and then I thrusted the necklace into her face.

Needless to say she looked at me disgusted, said no, slammed the door. The next day at school, her friends laughed at me, then she made me compete with a boy for her love, despite everyone knowing, even if I won the competition of sorts, she would still choose the other guy. 

She's now a dirty hoe and I have a girlfriend at University.

I don't care what gender they are, there is no excuse for hitting. I absolutely think that the partner who was emotionally abusive needs help, and is incredibly wrong. He has a real problem, I'm not arguing that. I'm well aware that his actions were horrible and hurtful to his partner. What I'm saying is that the abused partner could have done a myriad of other things. I understand the hurt, and the anger he must have felt but he is an adult.

As a gifted kid I was book smart, but terrible at dating. People told me ""Date and just have fun for a while"" but  they didn't tell me ""why"". My brain needs the ""why"" part to fully understand it. So, I hated people telling me that because I didn't understand. Now I understand. I advise people to date and sleep with 5-10 people before getting married to find who is compatible with you. 


As for intelligence, I can't realistically expect my SO to have the same interests as I do, so I just look to see if they try to carry on a conversation. If they ask questions, we're doing pretty good. (I have had some pretty weird hobbies so they usually have no clue what the hobby even is.)

It's the fact that Dogecoin is a joke in itself, yet is defended here like a foundation of society, while people crack jokes about NK's suppression of its whole population that angers me.

It's the fact that people on Reddit take the time to write a whole essay in the comments about how 10 corporations own almost all the assets on earth, which has been like this for about 150 years and is mostly helping society, while upvoting witty puns about genocide that angers me.

I don't think so much of humor is dark, I think humor shouldn't act as a  carpet under which we can push all the giant piles of shit on this world, so as to clean our room. 

Humor should be used to raise awareness of certain things that are important to us, and of course we can have a laugh about it, I do too. But don't forget we are all part of this world and after having a laugh about it, it's still a pile of shit we have to clean up.

honestlyopen,polyamory,1390736816.0,"This sounds really dumb, but I've found it to be really helpful. It is a technique in Cognitive behavioral therapy. You have three columns. In the first you write down the ""automatic thought"" that is upsetting you.  ""I can't satisfy my boyfriend""  In the second you write down what ""type"" of distorted thought this is... there is a list of types of distorted thoughts. This is maybe ""all or nothing thinking"" and then in the third you write a rational response back. ""My self worth is not based on whether I ""satisfy"" another human being, nobody is capable of satisfying anyone all of the time, my bf doesn't complete satisfy me as a person and I still love and cherish him. The concept of satisfying someone is a strange concept anyway""   

 Then you do this for every damn thought you have. Like maybe the next thought is ""People think I'm a chump for being with my bf""  Which is ""mind reading"" and you  respond ""not everyone thinks i'm a chump, i have friends that know and love me and think that I am in a good situation. Sometimes people need to be educated and unfortunately that task may fall unfairly to me, but by educating them I make the world a better place. Other people's perceptions of the situation have no bearing on what the situation actually is.""  

Continue every time you have a thought like that. It sounds super dumb, but it actually works. Check out ""Feeling good: The New Mood Therapy"" By David Burns for a detailed explanation that will give you confidence that this crap works, or check out some dumb site on Cognitive behavioural therapy for some lighter version that will probably seem just as dumb as I made it sound. It works though, I mean for me. It really works. That is why I am suggesting it even thought  it sounds super dumb.   Best of luck."

ScipiiRye,TumblrInAction,1390737679.0,"Egalitarianism is a well-established ideology seperate from feminism; *gender* equality is but one of the many aspects of it; egalitarianism is an ideological umbrella under which all types of equality are labelled.

Most people who identify as ""feminists"" have never heard of it, though, they just call themselves feminists because they assume that's the only ideology that stands for ""gender equality."" Just goes to show how despite feminists shrieking about ""the patiarchy"" and ""misogyny,"" most people still make the connection between equality and feminism, even when it's erroneous, because ""feminism"" is so widely recognized.

Bascially it's just not ""mainstream"" enough to be widely understood. Everyone's heard of feminism, but few understand what egalitarianism is. I've met people who thought ""feminism"" and ""egalitarianism"" were synonyms to be used interchangeably.

Susansays,AskReddit,1390737969.0,"There was a rumour going around that I was rich. I'm really not at all, my family owns a retail store that sells things for a lot of money but makes a very small profit and takes a lot of hours to run so if you're young and don't know much about business then I guess it looks like we make a lot of money.

It was coming up to my crushs 21st birthday and I was planning to do some stuff with him - and other friends, platonically, but I wanted to make a good impression, maybe make him realise that I liked him more than just a friend.

I asked around about what he wanted for his birthday and no one seemed to know so to make conversation with him I asked him. He said he was really hoping to get a gaming PC but there was no way he could afford it. Then he sighed and dramatically said ""If only my family was rich like yours."" I tried to shrug it off and joke ""No, we're not really"" but he wasn't buying it.

Then talking to his friend later on he confided that the guy really, really hoped that I would buy him that PC and he was really depressed and unhappy at the moment and it would cheer him up so much.

Well. I did it. I was working part time in my families store at minimum wage (to help out the family and the store really wasn't doing that well). The PC cost me 3 months wages.

He thanked me and then said ""I knew something like this would be no big deal for you."" Gave me a hug and walked off and then spent the next 3 months playing games on it with other people and ignoring me whilst I worked to pay for it.

TL:DR Spent lots of money on crush that I couldn't really afford. Was very dumb. Learned valuable lesson. Money doesn't buy love.  10 years later I still can't believe I did it."

However, the followers of Ur-Fascism must also be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.** Fascist governments are condemned to lose wars because they are constitutionally incapable of objectively evaluating the force of the enemy.

there's your problem.  when a dude is accustomed to being very intelligent and correct, and has that idea reinforced by external factors, he starts to listen to himself about stuff.  also, most people are pretty dumb.  combine these ideas, and it's easy to see what goes wrong.

""i'm smart as all getout and most people are dumber than dead shit.  most people believe [IDEA].  i've thought about it a little and have some issues with [IDEA].  ergo, [IDEA] is wholesale stupid and wrong.""

it's well and good to be smart, but if you are, you need to go out of your way to get knocked down *regularly*.  if you don't, it's really easy to fall in love with the sound of your own smartypants voice."

In addition, poverty is bitch all by itself. You don't need racism to be fucked over by poverty. Given the origin of the black population, it's not so strange they're only getting out of the poverty trap slowly. Racism doesn't help, but poverty is not just some fluke, rags to riches is the exception, not the rule. In particular in a society with such low social mobility as the USA.

a4bh3,AskHistorians,1390739157.0,"""Back then"" is quite general, but I will focus on engineering in the 18th century in France, which I hope you'll find interesting. I will use the examples of the Ecole Royale du Génie de Mezières and the Ecole Royale des Ponts et Chaussées. Essentially, you had to be a member of the aristocracy (until the French Revolution) and have good math scores. Students focused either on military engineering, naval engineering, or civil engineering. 

""The teaching was spread over six years: one year was dedicated to the learning of the theory, the second year to military exercises. The student then spent two years in a regiment and a further two years to complete the study was spent learning the practicalities of the job alongside an older engineer officer. This format set the pattern, first in the length of study and more significantly in the importance given to the link between the student and the former graduates of the school.""

After the French Revolution, the schools became more theory oriented (more mathematics based and less apprenticeship based) and the bonds and came to replace the guilds, which had also taught aspects of engineering.

TheLittleGoodWolf,childfree,1390739626.0,"&gt; It's quite hard to argue against a breeding law since I am theoretically for it, in a best case scenario, especially since I am child free and wouldn't want to exercise this right anyway.

A breeding law is pretty much close to eugenics and I agree with them both pretty much **in theory**. They are great theories where the goals are to better mankind in some way. The problem arises when you are to implement these theories in practice.

I'm a firm believer in that the ends do not justify the means, ever. The means should justify themselves and in some cases I can even see the means justifying the ends. Our bodies are ours and the state has little actual control over them. You cannot be forced to donate bodily tissue or fluids, you are free to do with your body as you wish with the exception of hurting others. If your body carries the ability to produce a child you are free to do so, you can be advised against doing it but not forced. That is your right.

Would it be better in theory to hinder some people from procreating? Yes, in many ways however, in practice it would be the removal of a human right, a punishment for a crime not yet committed. I can imagine that there may be some actions that could motivate sterilization as punishment but it's a slippery slope.

With the advent of vasalgel this question takes another turn though. I keep thinking of a potential similar variation for women as well and if such a thing becomes reality we have different possibilities. In such a world you could pretty much eliminate ""oops babies"" and teen pregnancy. It's not a removal of rights it's essentially a blocking of rights until a person proves able to handle the responsibility of such a right. It's still a slippery slope, but much less so and something that merits some discussion.

Another part of this would be when you look at inheritable diseases. If there is a very high risk of your child being born with a disease wouldn't having a baby essentially mean that you are hurting it. So the actual act of producing a child is automatically hurting it? questions questions.

Edit: I agree with you fully on the education note though. That is by far the very best way to go about this issue as of now. IMO there cannot be too much knowledge and understanding."

Cykuta,pics,1390739876.0,"Self-taught archers are a good point, though in normal modern settings you'd have access to sources that would point the errors out (looking at you Arrow). Also, this is not mathematics, there are different approaches and schools of thought possible. I know archers who bemoan *anyone* using a back quiver in media, even though they themselves meet us back-ers every day. But they will still complain that it's stupid and impractical because they use a belt quiver, and vice versa, of course.

My instructor friend once said that in archery, the point is to do what works best for you, as long as you're not injuring yourself or damaging the equipment."

Although Coutinho has been under performing I think he needs game time to get his confidence back. And replacing him with Moses in such an important game is suicidal in my opinion.

taonzen,freemasonry,1390740087.0,"&gt;From what I can understand freemasonry isn't a religion but I see religious symbols everywhere in freemasonry...

There's a reason for this. Freemasonry uses allegory and metaphor drawn on Old Testament stories, mainly the building of King Solomon's Temple. Consider that in the 1500s, the Bible was the one book that most people would have known about, and since the internet and cat memes hadn't been invented, those stories were part of the common culture in society. 

Mainstream Freemasonry - that is, the majority of the lodges in the US/UK - have the belief in a supreme being as one of the few requirements. If you live in or near a larger city, you may be able find a non-Mainstream lodge (one that has been chartered by a different Grand Lodge federation), although many of the unrecognized lodges also require a belief in a supreme being.

greiger,KeepWriting,1390740216.0,"To be honest I couldn't even convince myself to finish reading it.

There is a lot of repetition, sentences starting with ""he,"" over and over again. The dialogue was not realistic, there should be more contractions and since the man who owns the house states that it is early I would also try and imagine he might not be thinking clearly as he might've been woken early but this visitor.

A big part of the story that bothered me was there is a man, seemingly inviting himself in to the home of a stranger who doesn't mind, despite the odd hour, who then takes him on a tour. Maybe have him expecting the man to show up at 6pm but instead shows up at 6am: ""Oh, I do beg pardon, but my letter stated that I would arrive at 6. I'm sorry for not specifying the morning but honestly, who would want to tour a home at 6 at night?""...

The pacing also seems odd. Not in the story scheme of things, but paragraph structure wise. The first paragraph feels extremely choppy. Maybe try and flesh it out a bit more, and don't forget *show, don't tell* (i.e. how does the man's face appear kind) and maybe use that to flesh out the scene more.

fuzzybeard,AskReddit,1390740416.0,"I can one up you on that. I almost burned my nipples off with Nair. 

**BACKSTORY:** I have a history of heart disease that runs very strongly on both sides of my family (my dad died of a dissecting aortic aneurysm when he was 45), so when I turned 40, my doctor said it would be a good idea to have a stress echo-cardiogram annually. The first time I went, I had zero idea how they were going to go about doing this; so I was understandably nonplussed when the tech (very cute woman) dry shaved everywhere that the ECG leads were going to be stuck to. 

***367 days later...*** 

It's time again. Determined to not have a repeat of last year's dry shave fiasco (it itched like a sumbitch while the hair grew back) I had hit on a solution (or so I thought). I'd use my live-in girlfriend's (future ex-Mrs. Fuzzybeard) Nair on my entire chest. I read the directions, applied the stuff, waited 5 minutes (per directions), and rinsed. 

50% defoliation; not good enough. 

Here is where I made a stunningly critical error in judgment: **I reapplied the Nair,** ***immediately.***

The second application worked; but it was, at best, a Pyrrhic victory because the second application managed to get on my --surprisingly sensitive-- nipples.

They felt like that they had been blowtorched, and felt that way for 4 *days*  afterwards. I had to wear very baggy shirts and hunch over or else it felt like I was sanding my nipples with 80-grit sandpaper. 

It took 5 years to live this down; now I share my tale of woe with you in the hope that you had a good laugh.

I remember reading Richard visited the museum in Hiroshima and was reminded of it when he thought of Smaug destroying Erebor, and how he tried to draw on these emotions.

When you break it out point by point without being disrespectful you give them a lot to think about and the seed is planted. It doesn't happen overnight but eventually they come around to realizing that we are not all evil and ignorant.

It's easy to think of yourself as a liberal, before I knew anything about politics and what a liberal or conservative even was Facebook had a question on the profile page saying something to the effect of 'what do you consider yourself' I put very liberal because I thought 'I'm an easy going guy who doesn't judge anyone and I believe in freedom and the bill of rights, anyone should be free to own a gun and say whatever they like!' That sounded very liberal to me. 

As I matured in my understanding of what being a liberal meant over the years I realized I'd made a terrible mistake labeling myself as a liberal. 

You'd think the word liberal would equate to a focus on freedom and opportunity. Instead it really equates to liberal spending, giving money to people who don't work, enforcing 'equality' by giving minorities and women institutional advantages over people to 'level the playing field' for a perceived bias against them. Giving special rights to classes of people, censoring any opinion you don't agree with as 'hate speech' and perpetuating a constant victim mentality. Liberal ideas are ugly ideas, I'm more socially libertarian than anything but entirely fiscally conservative. I'm definitely not 'very liberal' as I learned what that really meant.

Berean_Katz,hockey,1390741173.0,"I'm a layman myself who only recently fell in love with this amazing sport, but I can tell you that one way I was really able to grasp the game was by actually playing it in some sense.

Now I'm still trying to figure out how to skate on ice, so I figured it would be a lot easier for the time being if I purchased a hockey video game to ease my way into it. Not too surprisingly, I've not only learned how to play hockey, but I've been able to quickly pick up on basic terms (like the difference between a slap shot and a snap shot), the names of players, the names of teams, when penalties should be called, and even unwritten rules like when it would be appropriate for an enforcer to start a fight.

Now, I'm not really trying to persuade you to spend money on a video game or anything. However, no matter how odd it might seem to some people, it definitely helped educate me on the understanding of how the game is played and at the same time how to better appreciate it.
_____
In any case, to help you out a little further, I'll attempt to expound upon a couple of things that helped me really get into the sport. These are:

1) Hits are legal. The hits I've seen in hockey are just as crazy as the hits I've seen in American Football or rugby--if not more so. There is, however, a certain way to do it. Please watch this vid for more info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GornRqDMS_g&amp;list=WLR4ljE6ntSHOJxYh_vJUAwnFLLL7YW-mD

2) Fights are perfectly legit. The price of fighting is clear cut: You and your opponent (if he fights back) are put in the sin bin for 5 minutes. That's reason enough to second-guess your decision to do so, but it's also used as a means to enforce the unwritten rules of hockey. For example, if an opposing player attempts to seriously injure one of your teammates, that's reason enough to step in and teach him/her a lesson. Or perhaps an opposing player takes a dive on a soft hit that you made, so you show him what a *real* hit is. This makes Hockey very unique to other sports, because it's the only one I know of that holds the players directly accountable for their actions, regardless of whether or not the rulebook has actually been broken (unlike basketball; read: flopping). The players have a lot more say on enforcing fair play than any other game I know of. Also, fighting can be used to lift up the spirits of a losing team, or even hypothetically to bring back some sort of honor/dignity to an already lost game. Bottom line is, fighting is here to stay in Hockey, and you gotta love it. It's like the icing on the cake that no other team sport really has.

3) That hockey is indeed very much a team-oriented sport. It truly requires cooperation from everybody to get the job done. In basketball, you can have a terrible team but one good player and win games. In hockey, everyone has a job to do and if a single one of them slacks off, the whole team suffers greatly. *Especially* if you have a poor goaltender.

4) **The excitment and emotion.** Taking a shot in hockey is a lot easier said than done. It's kinda got that soccer/football feel where every time a player takes a shot, your heart nearly skips a beat because of how much you just *hope* it goes in. If you notice, final scores in hockey games are usually pretty low because of how difficult it is. Just like soccer. So the moment a goal is made, you can't help but cheer your ass off. The tension released at that moment is exhilarating. What adds to that excitement is the fast-paced nature of the game. It's also pretty suspenseful because of how easy it is to turnover the puck.  So basically, hockey is full of excitement, emotion, suspense, and release. Can't get better than that.

5) Hockey is very much a culture. It's not just another game people play. People in Canada *love* this sport in the same way people overseas love soccer. I can definitely see where they're coming from too. If you really look in to how the entire game is put together, it really is one of the most flawless sports I've ever watched. I don't think I could ever consider basketball a ""culture"" in the same way hockey or soccer is. As much as I love basketball, it never reaches that level. This, I think, is part of what makes hockey so special. Because it's not just what's happening *on* the ice, it's what's happening off of it. I guess you could make this argument about any other sport, but that's just how I look at it. 

))As a little add-on, another cool thing about hockey is that you can rotate players in and out of a game as much times as you want. This creates a new type of strategy that you won't find in most other games.
____
So I apologize if this response is a little sloppy. Kinda late in the day and I'm ready to call it a night here in a minute; hopefully I've been able to help you better understand why this game is so awesome, and some method you could use to learn more about it. Also, the hockey video game I own is NHL '14, in case you were wondering. :)

Mikuta,killingfloor,1390741178.0,"Arguing that the M4 is better than the bullpup through damage is like saying that the scythe is better than the Katana. The M4 has the same weight, costs TWICE that of the bullpup and has considerably less ammo. As long as you don't spam with the Bullpup it is accurate enough to kill zeds far away.

The price tag and the ammo is what makes it worse IMO. ""Widely considered"" still stands, even though you disagree.

**Edit:** Continuing on the pricing, what makes the M4 even shittier is that the AK costs the same thing. When you have enough money for a bullpup, it's the best. If you have enough money for an M4, you should leave it alone and buy the AK."

The author explains in detail how the provisional East German authorities functioned within what amounted to Soviet military rule that included rampant confiscation of resources in the name of reparations (dismantling of entire factories was a favorite Soviet means of achieving this kind of payback).  The book has a whole chapter devoted to the question of rape of German women by Soviet soldiers, a crime that was repeatedly perpetuated during the military occupation.  If you're into nuclear politics, the book also covers Soviet takeover of uranium mining facilities in the Erzebirge mountains to fuel their own nuclear program.

Heck, I didn't experiment with guys until my 40s. I found the right guy, and I was terribly nervous the first time. But he was really nice.

When I started experimenting I told a few girlfriends and lady friends. All were supportive. One said ""Oh, you're bi? Good for you. What do you want to eat?"" That's the best answer.** She made it a non-issue.** Several girls thought it was really hot watching me with a guy.  

&gt; Do guys experiment as much as girls?

Probably not because of potential attacks on their ""manliness"". This is why the concept of ""manliness"" is outdated. You can be a responsible adult, you can be dominant, but do we really have to use ""manliness"" anymore? I may look like  a choir boy but I'm a real aggressive pervert in bed. People shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

Sexism was rampant then too but most women did not work, especially the older generation. I think a lot of women were worried that they would have to pay their own way and be more responsible for themselves. Back then when a woman got married she would often ditch her job and become a full time homemaker.

Ronald Reagan was also stating that we don't need a constitutional amendment, there were plenty of laws on the books regarding discrimination against women. OK he was a conservative and believed in states' rights and smaller government, but this would have been smaller government. Just get rid of a crazy patchwork quilt of laws and replace it with a uniform short amendment. Another reason I hate Reagan. Everyone talks about how wonderful he was. He wasn't, he was a jerk in many ways and this was one of the ways. 

Having an amendment would have also sent an important cultural message not just a legal one. Reagan overlooked that entirely. "

Edit: I'm not saying carries should build survivability or regen and focus on damage + attack speed. This is a rough explanation of what the roles are for.

 I went to public school for a year then came back. The dynamic changed because the boys now picked me to be on their team in soccer.

I have a strange relationship with the Catholic Church. For years I couldn't step inside one after my conformation, because of the pain that experience brought me. The first time I stepped inside a church since was two years ago, and then only because it was my uncle's funeral. Since then I've only been back once, for my grandmother's funeral. Despite this I do feel connected culturally to Catholism, specifically Irish Catholism.

However I am agnostic, with a view that is smack dab in the middle of atheist and theist.

My limit is waiting 2 months. I want LTR and I can't wait longer to find out if we're sexually compatible.

HUGE red flag. This encourages dysfunctional, unhealthy relationships because sex is one of the top 3 things couples fight about, along with kids and money. You must be compatible in all 3 areas, or at least be happy with the differences. I don't mean you ""settle"", I mean you are happy with the differences. 

Also, for many men, sex = intimacy. If there's no intimacy, the relationship often stalls. 

Don't take my word for it, go to /r/deadbedrooms and look at the frequent posters who were virgins when they got married. They are in a miserable marriage.

You don't need to know fancy builds or great strategies. Landing your hook will often net you some kills and that'll be helpful. Tips for landing hook:


&gt; predict where your target will be 1 second from now and throw it in that direction

&gt; don't be afraid to spend the hook when it's not very likely to hit. The cool down isn't that high anyway and *""every hook you don't throw is a hook you don't hit""*

Once I calmed down enough I would drink a cup of tea or take a nap. 


If you mean just feeling alone or frightened, for instance, when I had my surgery, at home I have my electric blanket which I love a lot (not literally) because lying on that is very comforting. Reddit is nice because I don't have to make real friendships; I can talk about something and choose to answer or not. So it makes me feel like I interact with people but not too much because I don't like that. Sometimes, I work or watch a TV series or movies. I listen to music a lot, particularly the radio. I didn't used to, but I found after the surgery that it's nice. The music and voices are comforting. 

Also, TBH, drugs. Sometimes alcohol. Not all the time, but when things are particularly trying they work pretty well. I have to be careful because if I do too much they won't work as well.

Not every game is for every player - whether it's because they can't identify with he-man or waif characters, dislike the level or types of violence, or just find the game too hard. And that's perfectly fine - no art form needs to appeal to everyone nor should they be constrained by any but the most extreme boundaries.

Celebreth,AskHistorians,1390742979.0,"Hey, just as a gentle correction here :) Everything in your post is...not quite correct. By the time of the Empire (~32 BCE), there were *plenty* of non-Italian Romans. The Romans offered quite the incentives for being Roman - and the aristocracy of conquered peoples were often assimilated into the Roman heirarchy. Even for the ""lower civilians,"" there was always the opportunity to gain citizenship by serving in the *auxilia* (Well, until one Emperor just made everyone a citizen. But that's besides the point). I wouldn't say the Empire was so much *policed* by Romans (Honestly, their main forts were all set up on the borders of the Empire to prevent incursions, rather than scattered throughout to prevent rebellion) so much as it was *ruled* by Romans - and there's a high distinction. Obviously, there were some areas that revolted (Lookin' at you, Israel/Palestine/Levant) rather regularly - however, they were more the exception than the rule. Roman rule wasn't harsh - hell, it came with loads of benefits - and the Roman policies were generally focused more towards *assimilation* than a ""police state"" - and people, as a result, didn't really ""generally dislike their Roman overlords.""

For example, most multis won't have enough vitamin D to do you any good, ditto for magnesium.

- Vitamin D has been shown to help with fatigue and pain and possibly helps with the depression of SAD.

- The B vitamins can help with fatigue if you're deficient. B12 especially. 

- Muscle pain might be helped by magnesium.

Flex_Plexico,worldnews,1390743221.0,"You do realise every Christian prays to some extent or another, right?

 Praying while trying to deal with a big decision is more evidence that he took the decision with a great deal of weight rather than just tossing it in the air and flipping a coin as you seem to be suggesting he was doing.

 beyond that the fact he is catholic and he prays makes him religious, not a religious extremist... there are a significant number of religious people who are not extremist. that is basically the definition of extremist.

In the article **you** linked there is evidence that he is in fact a progressive catholic rather than conservative or extremist:
&gt;""If you look at Tony Blair's voting record in the House of Commons, he's gone against Church teaching on more than one occasion. On things, for example, like abortion,"" she said.

a willingness to go against his churches teachings suggests a non-extremist nature, after all extremists in the case of religion are often rigid in interpretation of ""insert holy book"" and unforgiving when it comes to changes in stance and opinion.

I honestly don't know anything about the guys career or beliefs, more than that article says, I am Australian and don't know a lot about the British Government. so it may very well be that he is on the extremist side of Catholicism, but the fact he used prayer to aid in the decision process for a huge decision does not suggest he is extremist."

Atheists don't need to disprove god, pointing out wrong or bad things in the bible (or any other story about any other god) is only a way to show why this specific god is not good, not logic or not possible.

* [Dennou Coil](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2164/Dennou_Coil) (Features an anime version of Google Glass but way cooler. Most of the sci-fi stuff is probably fairly plausible, but the legends surrounding Michiko-san and all that are more supernatural than sci-fi)

* The Moon Embracing the Sun*
* Master's Sun
* Two Weeks

Those with an asterisk at the end indicate historical dramas or those that have historical elements (sageuk).

 There are actually some excellent dramas running right now that may make my top ten *really* difficult to organize once they finish, but this is how things stand at the moment!

Unfortunately, ""Coffee Prince"" is probably Yoon Eun Hye's best drama. I've seen her in a few other things, but none where she particularly stands out like in CP (except for maybe """"Mirae's Choice"", but overall it's not a good drama, she's just good in it, overall). The only other drama I've seen Gong Yoo in was ""Biscuit Teacher &amp; Star Candy"" (aka Hello My Teacher). It's *fine*, but not great. He's excellent in the movie ""The Crucible"", though, and his other movie ""Finding Mr. Destiny"" is cute fun.

TheCryptic,electronic_cigarette,1390744018.0,"&gt; -are e-cigarettes a good alternative?

I believe so.

&gt;-what kind of e-cigarettes are there?

There are many kinds.

&gt;-are the e-cigs and the nicotine expensive overtime?

Anything you keep buying on a regular basis is expensive over time.  But everyone seems to agree that it's either cheaper than smoking or that they enjoy it so much they turn it into a full hobby.

&gt;-what is a good 'starter' e-cig?

The long answer would come after a bunch of questions and answers.  The the short answer is usually this: http://www.vapedojo.com/collections/starter-kits/products/kanger-mini-protank-2-starter-kit-vv

&gt;-how do you add and regulate the nicotine content?

The liquid comes in a variety of nicotine strengths.  How to actually putting it in your device depends on what specific device you have.

&gt;-what has your experience with e-cigarette been like?

I suppose from the view of someone trying to quit smoking the best word I can use to describe my experience is ""Successful"".  I'm one of those folks that enjoy it enough to turn it into a hobby, so I could ramble on forever.  But I've been 99.999% tobacco free since my quit date in September.  I have had one cigarette since then, but that was out of curiosity rather than addiction.

Then they liked Kurt Zisa's name so much, he won and it's now the name of the boss.

About the data, well, they supposedly aren't doing a good enough job keeping track of all their data. Similarly, if they didn't port their NES and SNES games to other platforms, they wouldn't have been able to remaster FFVI for instance for smartphones (which is based on the GBA port).

They did lose most of their data for KH1 for an unknown reason, yes, but do note that they still had KH1 assets in more recent KH releases, along with the fact that they could take a lot by hacking into a copy of the game and so on.

Most fortunately, this only applied to KH1, so with 2.5 ReMIX, it probably won't be as much of a hassle seeing as they both have 100% of the original data AND the remastering team also happened to work on most of the games for that collection."
Cykuta,RichardArmitage,1390744321.0,"Well, there's already a lot of people who insist that ""dumb bitch Lily rejected Snape for jerk James"" (at least it seems to me there are?

Imagine the hysteria Richard would cause in the role, especially since he said many times he wants to make *every* character of his sympathetic, that he wants to make us understand them and see where are they coming from and all that.

Damn, now I wonder how would he go about a role where he would explicitly have to *not* do that. Something that goes, ""this man is a monster, no, he's got no redeeming qualities, no, you're not supposed to give him any, you're supposed to leave us in awe of his villainy. *No* sympathy!"" I think he'd be absolutely brilliant, but may not like it.

&gt;  I can't imagine what it would have been like if Thorin had just been a grumpy angry and rude dwarf, without all that depth he gives him.

Ironically, I think a lot of fans would prefer that, because then you'd just have ""Bilbo And The Background Dwarves"" and that would have been simpler. Richard brought so much depth to Thorin, and many fantasy fans feel uneasy at the idea of dwarves having character depth (double irony! :D) I love his Thorin even more for that, because I've been around the fantasy fandom for years and I loathe the standard approach to dwarfdom, which is ""I drink and curse and belch a lot and make sexist jokes, hahaha!""

Kiwi150,Meditation,1390744808.0,"The reason why cannabis is frowned upon is because it dampens your awareness. I speak from (extensive) experience.

You say it makes you more relaxed, but what does being relaxed have to do with meditation? What kind of meditation are you practicing? From what I know of meditation, you should be as alert as naturally possible. The more chemicals you add to the mix, the more mud in your glass of water, the longer it will take for that mud to settle before you can see things for what they are.

That being said, I do understand the allure of trying something like meditation while the mind is being altered by substances like cannabis and psychedelics. But it should be understood that it is not proper meditation, especially since chemicals that alter the mind *are* explicitly prohibited. It isn't ""some people will tell you.."" it is ""most people"", or that is most people who've actually been practicing proper meditation.

I see more people on Reddit espousing tolerance for the use of intoxicants in meditative practices than in the real world, so I can understand the misunderstanding that would arise from this. "

Sorry if I'm not explaining this well, but something like this: http://www.anticz.com/heads.htm. It allows you to draw, and eventually internalise,  the correct proportions of a human face. In all honesty,  the best thing you can do is look over any picture you've ever drawn, and think 'what gave me the most trouble?'. If you have trouble with eyes, draw as many of them as you can with a reference. Ditto for hands, shoulders, etc. Draw as much as you possibly can, then try and draw your friend again in a month.

If this is serious, and you wait, it's only going to cost your parents more in the long run, anyway.

How to approach them? I'm not sure what your parental situation is like, but in most cases it's probably easier to approach the mother. However I come from a family where it's easier to approach my father, due to him being more understanding (he's the one who got me on birth control and bought my first box of tampon and my mother is a hypochondriac), so it really depends on your individual family. 

Now if a medical word such as breast is considered a dirty word in your house then you only need to use a different word to explain to them what's wrong. You could simply say chest. Or, if you want to be extra medical, mammary gland. 

By the way, there could be a number of reasons for this to develop. Lumps in breasts are vary common and usual do not mean the c-word, or even that they are life threatening.

Merad,BSG,1390745143.0,"&gt;How do jump drives work?

They are a form of space folding technology.  We don't hear very many details during the series, but since a ship can be jumped even while stationary, I would theorize that it causes two points in space to exist for a moment as a single point.  As they separate back into two distinct points, the ship can choose which of the two it will go with.

&gt;Can a ship theoretically jump instantly from place to another, no matter the distance?

I don't recall any indication that longer jumps require more energy, so in theory yes.  The limiting factor is calculating the jump.

But you DID want it, you DID want her, you said so yourself. You just didn't know how to make it work so you had a tantrum and told her to fuck off. I'm not saying walking away was a bad idea, but you did it for the wrong reasons.

&gt; Girls always know. They have this thing called ""a woman's intuition

If you were talking about girls in their thirties or maybe late twenties I MAY have conceded that you have a point. But I'm guessing she was 18-19-ish since you're 19. Most girls that age haven't had the time or experience to develop that kind of intuition. Many girls I know didn't even THINK about that stuff till their late teens. Assuming every girl is superhuman is just silly.

&gt; I'd bet you all the money in my wallet that she wasn't surprised in any way that I was attracted to her

THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE A MOVE? If she was ok hanging around you and you were certain she knew you liked her then obviously she doesn't mind that fact. Obviously you have a pretty good chance to get with her.

&gt; stating intentions only non-verbally

I agree with you on this, you should have the confidence to express yourself verbally. But you should also understand that it is necessary to give non-verbal cues initially as this is a social circle situation. You want to be in a position that you don't act like just a friend so that when you DO verbalise it, it isn't a shock.

Remember that you have to calibrate for the social situation that you're in. If you are confident enough to verbalise you feelings, it will show in your general body language. Feeling that you MUST express it verbally and not thinking of the context of the situation doesn't sound confident at all. It sounds like you've heard somewhere that verbalising it means you must be confident. So you're constantly trying to prove to yourself you are confident while ignoring your actual goal. That's not confidence, that's desperation, which is just a hair short of neediness.

I feel a little bad being so negative here, but I think you need to hear this. Please, instead of just flinging your negative emotions around, try and find their source. Try and resolve them instead of taking it out on other people.

I'm fine with teachers wearing crosses, or maybe having some sort of daily devotional sitting on their desk that they might read during their scant free time, but the moment you tell a student, unprovoked, the meaning of your cross, or you crack open the devotional and start reading aloud from it to the students, you've crossed a line.

Its a good idea to book in with a doctor now to talk about it as an option, so you get the ball rolling and prove to Doctors you are serious about this as an option.

Cost is dependant on whether NHS will pay for it, I'm not Canadian, In Australia it depends on how you access it, If you see a public doctor and convince them to to it in a public clinic/hospital, it will be &lt;$1000 (USD) here, potentially free depending on what other health cards you have. The issue is that in the public system, you are at the will of the doctors and as a non-medical elective procedure, the waiting list could be 10 years long. Private can cost anywhere from $200 to $8000 depending on who you see, what private insurance you have and what method of surgury you chose to have.

These prices are kind of useless, But I guess they are more useful than the american costs, given their medical care is crazy.

Down time also depends on how you opt to go about it. Tubal ligation via keyhole and ablation has a downtime of about 24 hours, Its a day-procedure done in just a few minutes, so you are only at the hospital a few hours, movement will be restricted of 2-3 days, and a ""no lifting &gt;5kg"" period of a week or two.

Essure is a new sterilisation method, Its basically two implanted devices that cause scarring in the fallopian tubes essentially blocking them. Its just as effective as a tubal ligation, but downtime is a lot less because its inserted almost the exact same way as an IUD. via the vagina. It can be a lot more stressful and painful though because you are awake the whole time. It doesn't work for everyone because sometimes the implants wont stay put, and you have to wait 3 months for the scarring to block the tubes so no unprotected sex until your 3 month follow up exam. With a surgical tubal ligation, You can have sex as soon as you have your next period. or within 2 weeks of surgery."
bubbish,AskMen,1390745679.0,"When I see a girl with a really fit body, for instance at the gym, I feel jealous like I'd also want a body like that. It's strange because why would a man want a woman's body. I always confuse myself when that happens.

Clewis22,truegaming,1390746111.0,"Look, you're clearly very passionate about Nintendo, which is great, but let's be real here. You're really stretching to find decent third party games (just dance and cooking mama? A remake of goldeneye? Super monkey ball? Seriously?) that would appeal to 'hardcore' gamers. ZombieU is probably the most interesting one, but that's only one game for a console that's been out for months. Fact of the matter is, Nintendo systems for the past two generations haven't had anywhere near the amount of third party support that gamers want.

Your argument is that Nintendo consoles are perfectly valid for hardcore gamers, but dismiss services like Twitch just as they're becoming incredibly popular? Those services are becoming crucial in the age of lets play and social gaming, because people genuinely do want to show off their achievements. 

PS4 markets for the gamers because they don't have to worry about the rest of their service. They HAVE good online capabilities, they HAVE good social connectivity, they HAVE tv, they have what are pretty much basic requirements of a next gen system, and the last generation had them too. So people don't need to have it advertised to them, they already expect it as pretty basic features. The only thing that people were worried about was whether all these features would 'soften' sony a bit towards a casual market (which is no bad thing, but not sony's traditional market). So the marketing responds with 'you know the rest, here's a look at our GAMES'. Microsoft have run along similar lines with their marketing. Nintendo, by comparison, have so few good things to say about the Wii U that they can't afford to focus their approach on a few features, because a few features are all it has. It's the difference between 'If all these features aren't enough for you then, well, does Killzone peak your interest?' and 'Play Mario on our system because...well...you have to'

Now don't get me wrong: hardcore gamers LOVE nintendo games. But that love isn't enough to make them buy an inferior console for a few games that they'll probably play a couple of times for nostalgia purposes and forget about. That's why they want nintendo to embrace third party, or go party. No in between.

Finally, Nintendo doesn't actually have to market itself towards the hardcore crowd to be successful. The Wii made that abundantly clear. That said, they do need to make sure they know the casual market to succeed, and offer something sufficiently different from the Wii to make buyers move, because a touchscreen just won't cut it. Most casual buyers thought it was an odd on to the Wii, which is a legitimate thought considering the way it was marketed and the amount of peripherals previously released for the system.

No, modern ecologically compliant products are more expensive, have higher margins and have the added benefit of not having to compete with non-eco products because those become illegal.

assesment of utily, go to the nearest auto dealer and drive the cheapest car they have, it's probably going to have a eco badge on it cause its simply bad marketing to say it's under-powered and do a drive test, find a hill and climb it.

While concerning the vaccum cleaner issus, if you are asking for a utility assessment, I can only deduce you either never used a vacuum cleaner of never used a good one.*

Gogogodzirra,LeagueofLegendsMeta,1390747339.0,"Here's how I feel personally about swain:

Strengths:

* Amazing lane bully against most champs
* Forces teams to focus differently in team fights
* 2 items make him a beast, 3 make him a terror, 4 and the opposing team will have no choice but to make you target 1 and kite you out.  5 items and you win, truly.
* If you win lane and your other lanes didn't completely get destroyed and fed, you are in a great end game position.

Cons:  

* That lack of mobility leaves openings for junglers, BUT, if you've already all-in, and have enough mana, you'll at least take 1 with you usually
* I personally have mana issues early with him.  If you have a manaless jungler, and they're super nice and give you first blue, it's your lane to lose.  
* Ignite's a bitch.
* You will become the CC focus if you're ahead.  I will get blown up before I can R if a team is smart
* If you get behind, I've found it really hard to get back in the game.

I seperate beauty and physical attraction. For instance, there are many girls that society has decided are beautiful, but I don't find all of them physically attractive. That's the key point here. Of course beautiful people can have friends of the opposite sex(or the same sex if they are gay/bi).

The line for me has to be drawn when you start to develop lust for the other person. In short: you're not supposed to want to bang your friend. That just doesn't sound like a healthy friendship to me. It's a ticking bomb, and in many cases a recipe for disaster. What if you suddenly start to develop feelings for this person? That can lead to all sorts of problems.

I just wish more people were honest with themselves when it comes to these friendships that have a foundation partly(or mostly?) built on physical attraction. So many friendships and relationships have been ruined because of this."

handshape,AskMen,1390747448.0,"Right off the bat, thanks for the question -- answering these forced me to introspect thoroughly on some of my own behaviours. That being said, here goes!

&gt; What do you value in a person's demeanor?

Quiet confidence, punctuated with the occasional bit of wit.

&gt; How much does the person's style of dress influence your opinion of them?

Lots. There are a lot of things about a person's appearance that are immutable, but style of dress is not one of them. In just about any moderately-affluent country, anyone can pretty much dress any way they like as a choice of personal expression. How a person dresses is thus a good gauge of who they believe themselves to be.

&gt; Would you rather a person to tell you they can't do a particular task outright, or instead at least try with probable faliure?

How about neither? Ask for the least amount of help you think you need, then go get it done. The person making the request should see this as an attempt to contribute the most while taking the least.

&gt; How do I hold a conversation with you?

Start with a question that shows the level of understanding you already have of the topic. ""What do you think about the situation in Kyev?"" or ""Have you tried the new Baltic IPA?""

Never play dumb to make men feel better about themselves. (Damn. Actually that's not fair.) If you play dumb, smart people will see this as manipulation. If you want to hang out with smart people, this will thus be counterproductive.  

&gt; Is there anything that makes you lose respect or get annoyed instantly?

Rudeness. Entitlement. Manipulation.

&gt; What actions can I take to gain your respect as an equal?

Impress me. Be more than you seem. Teach me something without making a show of it. Most of all, don't *try* to gain my respect; just earn it.

&gt; Would you/have you ever consider a teenage girl as your equal?

I do my best not to rank people like that. I do group people  into ""interesting"" and ""not interesting"" -- and there *have* been young women who've made the ""interesting"" list for the reasons I list above."
Celebreth,AskHistorians,1390747451.0,"Okee doke, I have two things for you! First off: I just made a post with recommended books over [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1w5r2i/books_on_rome/) yesterday :) I'll quote it for you below!

---

Starting off, my favourite authour with regards to Roman history is Adrian Goldsworthy. His books aren't only readable - they're *extraordinarily* informative and entertaining, all rolled into one. He's written LOADS of books on Rome, and every single one has been a treat - I can't recommend him highly enough. 

Regarding the Roman military, there are a couple of books that he's written that'll outline the Roman military WONDERFULLY for you - hell, they definitely were highly useful for me. [*The Complete Roman Army*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Roman-Army-Series/dp/0500288992/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390701899&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+complete+roman+army) is exactly what it says - it's a fantastic book that's not too long, but is completely chock full of information and pictures (It sounds weird that I emphasize this, but seriously. Those pictures are AWESOME). It primarily focuses on the force that we think of when we think ""Roman Army"" - the army of the Principate - but it outlines the Roman army through time.

Next, [*Roman Warfare.*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060838523/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i5?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0AT5V25CZMPHYG7RW919&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1688200382&amp;pf_rd_i=507846) It's similar to the previous book, but focuses on the Roman army in a slightly different way, if that makes sense :) I highly recommend both books if possible.

Finally, with regards to the Roman army and how it helped grow the Republic/Empire, I'll recommend [*In the Name of Rome*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0753817896/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0AT5V25CZMPHYG7RW919&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1688200382&amp;pf_rd_i=507846). This one focuses on the *generals* for the most part, giving short biographies of each, as well as a fantastic background of Rome herself, and how that evolution both influenced and was influenced by these men. 

Now, to the evolution of Rome herself! Since you're familiar with the early republic (sorta), I'd advise reading [*The Fall of Carthage*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0304366420/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i3?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0AT5V25CZMPHYG7RW919&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1688200382&amp;pf_rd_i=507846) - it encompasses a *lot* more than the name suggests, as Dr. Goldsworthy LOVES to describe the background to help you understand the subject intimately - something few people do as well as he does. He begins with Alexander's death in ca. 323 BCE and continues through the legacy of the destruction of Carthage (which occurred in 146 BCE). Want to understand Rome between that time frame? Read this book.

Then, what I consider to be Goldsworthy's finest work - his biography, [*Caesar: Life of a Colossus.*](http://www.amazon.com/Caesar-Life-Colossus-Adrian-Goldsworthy-ebook/dp/B0015R3HJS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390702648&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=life+of+a+colossus) As the name suggests, the book discusses Caesar's life - and, as per Goldsworthy, it discusses *everything* about the society of his life. It's an incredibly good read and I consider it to by my ""bible"" of sorts with regards to the late Roman Republic. **If you can only get one book on this list, this is the book that I recommend.**

I haven't read anything regarding the Empire (ca. 32 BCE-476 CE), sadly, so I'll leave it there - however, you may be interested in one of Goldsworthy's books that I haven't read quite yet - [*How Rome Fell: Death of a Superpower*](http://www.amazon.com/How-Rome-Fell-Death-Superpower-ebook/dp/B0029F1C1U/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390702815&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=adrian+goldsworthy) 

I hope that helps! :)

EDIT: One more! Barry Strauss' [*The Spartacus War*](http://www.amazon.com/Spartacus-War-Barry-Strauss-ebook/dp/B001UFP6FS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390702964&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+spartacus+war) is a rather brilliant read that gives some great insight into slavery, gladiators, and the Third Servile War (~72 BCE). 

---

Next, I noticed that another user mentioned Dan Carlin. I'm gonna go ahead and straight up say that **Dan Carlin is not a good way to introduce yourself to Ancient Rome.** I'm sorry, but his massive, 5 part podcast is glorified pop history - while it's right in some ways, in others, it's completely misinformed, the main source he uses is Tom Holland's *Rubicon* (Which is essentially a modern day political commentary couched in pop history), and one of the *worst* things you can do is to start off by learning misinformation. Mr. Carlin, as he often says, is not a historian - and I actually did a writeup of my thoughts on him [here :)](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ppmsm/thoughts_on_dan_carlin/cd4qedu)

In my last relationship, which lasted about eight years, I was most definitely a square peg trying to fit in a round hole. I kept sanding off those corners trying to make myself fit. He pretty much lived his life and I was along for the ride. I did not realize this at the time. We both definitely had a sunk-cost fallacy going on in that relationship, because we were both unhappy. I also was in so deep with his family, and with the life that we had built, that it seemed impossible and wrong to break up in spite of how miserable we were. Eventually he met someone who fit his lifestyle much better than I could, and yanked off that band-aid. At the time I hated him for it, but he did me a favor. 

The person I am with now just fits with me. We are on the same page about almost everything, and the ways that we do differ compliment each other. I can't explain it. We just fit. I know because I spent years trying to fit with other people and I didn't. 

And sorry to be cheesy but I know it when we are making love, because I have never felt what I feel during those moments. I thought I understood making love but I didn't. I wasn't even *into* making love before him. And when we are not ""making love"" per se, we are still totally in sync. We just agree about everything in that department.

I can actually picture a future with him, too... not some hazy ""maybe when x and y happen"" but concrete goals and images. Never had that before either. It's hard to explain. It's like everything I had before was some shadow of a relationship, and I didn't know any better. Then he came along and I actually found out what it's *supposed* to be like."

behemuthm,AskMenOver30,1390747842.0,"DINKs here. I make about double what my wife makes. We have separate checking accounts but a joint savings that we use to transfer money back and forth. We added up the total monthly bills and divided by how much I make. Whatever that percentage is, she pays the equivalent. So if rent is $1000 a month, I'd pay $750 to her $250, for example.

What's great about this system is that we don't care what the other spends on anything - makes things relatively stress-free. Turned out last year we both managed to save 40% of our incomes which was awesome. It's always a nice surprise when we look at going on vacation or whatever and knowing we can afford it. We live very simply and don't have expensive hobbies or shopping habits. The latter I'm *very* grateful for. I have friends whose wives have to get $50 manicures every other week, and $200 haircuts every month. I've spent more on haircuts ($14 every month) than my wife does ($40 twice a year).

When we go traveling, I usually get the airline tickets and she'll get the hotel room, and we'll take turns with meals. If we're not on vacation and going out to dinner, I pay if it's more than $40 - she pays if it's less.

We've had our system in place for years and seems to work for us!"

* She does no cardio, but she definitely lifts weights.  I would argue after doing strength training properly, you'll be just as winded as 25 minutes on a treadmill.  (Don't believe me, Squat, then deadlift, then standing military press, you'll want to collapse from exhaust).
* Now onto the positive, she's a good example of believing and following something
* Good on her for trying to provide her experiences.

It's hard to leave, especially when you care about a person and don't want to hurt him. Especially when they throw their emotional wellbeing in your face. The only person that can fix his emotional health is him. You have very little to do with it, but he sure will make you feel like you do.

You aren't a horrible person. You're a person who has done the best she can and it's time to move on before you allow him to hurt you anymore and for more damage to be done to yourself.

[The dog in question](http://imgur.com/Kvlq6q1) was found cowering in some bushes while me and this girl were out 'walking' late one night. He was limping and had a pretty bad cut on his leg. She was going nuts over the poor mutt so I scooped him up, carried him home and made a little bed for him out of some newspaper and an old pillow. I like animals but this poor guy was disgusting. I gave him some water and I think I managed to find some food for him, but we pretty much had to burn anything in my house that he sat on. In the morning I called the RSPCA and they came and took him away, but about a week later I started dating the girl, so it paid off.

Youth is about learning from mistakes and growing as a person. If you just sailed through, you may learn a lot about yourself later down the road. If you lived through fucking up your teens and early 20s and learned from that, your late 20s and 30s can be the best time of your life. "

mundabit,ChronicPain,1390748376.0,"Once my doctor gave me a scale that described ""1"" as being a itching sensation, and ""3"" as being ""an injection or needle"" 

I remember jokingly asking if it was a logarithmic scale because if a needle is a 3 then my ""4"" just became a 4000 because I can't even feel needles.

There are so many reasons that numbers will just never work at explaining pain.

I have several scales, as I explained to a nurse who thought it was clever but sadly too long winded to use in triage.

So, here is how my scale works. You still use the numbers 1-10, but there are several scales. the first scale is how bad the pain hurts at the location of the injury or pain origin. Lets use a papercut as an example as most of us have gotten one, and it stings, focus right on the cut, right there the pain is a 6-7. 

Now the second scale, How bad is that pain in relation to the rest of your body, If *all* you have is a paper cut, then its going to be a 1 or 2 on that scale maybe a touch higher if you experience hyperalgesia. Compared to something like the pain of hypertonic muscles, your muscles are a much larger part of your body, so if all your muscles hurt, the number will be higher.

Now you need to think about the duration of the pain. A papercut will heal within a few hours, that is the longest you will have to deal with this pain. on a scale from 1-10, 1 being a few seconds, 5 being months, 10 being a life-long thing, a papercut would be a 1.

Finally, How much the pain is impacting you, 0 being not at all, in fact you didn't even know you were in pain until I started saying the word 'pain' a hundred times in this comment. 10 is basically a vegetable state, completely paralysed by the pain.

With these four scales, you can find the mean, mode or medium of these 4 numbers to get a better idea of the true pain-scale number.

But another thing to consider is the type of pain. For me, a stabbing pain is always worse than an aching pain, a throbbing isn't as bad as a splitting. On top of that, certain body parts can handle more pain than others, My shoulder hurts pretty bad, I'd call it a 6, but if I had that same exact pain in my temples, I'd be calling it an 8.

Another thing that comes into play is how the pain responds to treatments. I have a headache, a 6 or so, But If I massage my head it really helps to almost completely relieve the pain, so I reduce the pain-number to a 5 because I know how to manage it, I can;t manage it all the time because I need my hands to type, But I know that as soon as I hit send I can go back to rubbing my head, and that ties in with the ""how long is the duration of the pain"" scale I have."

circledot,Teachers,1390748424.0,"My school is urban but not inner city. It's near a middle-class suburb, so about 35-40% of the kids are from middle class homes and the rest are from lower income homes. When I tell people where I work they often give me a weird look and say that they hear my school is pretty rough.

I teach high school English. My AP classes are generally filled with students who have both parents in their lives and who are very involved. They are well-behaved and motivated. The students who are lower income and take honors/AP are often the first in their families to go to college or even graduate high school. 

I also teach general classes where the student population is very different. Last month I had two girls get in a fight in my class that ended with them being taken away by police. It isn't unusual in my school but the disturbing thing about it is that most of the students see it as entertainment and were talking the next day about how ""funny"" it was. Some had their phones out, taking video of it. One of the girls who fought got suspended a few weeks later for fighting with another student in the hallway, and it turns out that the other student had a gun. The administration handled it well but none of the teachers really seemed surprised as we believe more students carry weapons to school than we know. We don't have metal detectors or anything, so it would be easy for a kid to sneak something in and not get caught. It's not a school shooting thing, it's a group of kids who think they need to arm themselves because of what goes on outside of school. These are kids who have been carrying a gun since they were 13 and know how to get one on the street for $20.

I've also had students' phones/mp3 players stolen in class and I've never found out who did it, because nobody wants to be a ""snitch"". Students curse all the time without thinking and I am constantly asking them to monitor their language. Many of my students work nearly full time outside of school or take care of younger siblings. It's nearly impossible to assign homework since generally only 3 or 4 kids in the class do it. I also have some students whose literacy skills are very low and would have significant challenges reading a book on their own outside of school.

Teen pregnancy is common. I have a student currently who is 18 and about to give birth to her second child. Being pregnant would not ostracize you socially at my school. The girls are generally excited about their pregnant friends and treat it as normal. It is always strange to hear 16-year-olds talk about their sons and daughters, though.

Despite all of these challenges, I like teaching my students. The vast majority are good people who have goals and dreams for their lives and have unfortunately been born into a difficult situation. Some of them have little understanding of what it would take to actually reach those goals. For example, there are many students who say they want to be pediatricians and veterinarians but have a 1.3 GPA and 40 absences.

I am popular with the kids and have built a reputation as a good teacher by being caring but firm, encouraging, and enthusiastic. Many students are starved for positive role models and want attention and validation from a stable adult. They want positive relationships with adults because they sometimes don't have that outside of school. Even the girls who fought in my classroom didn't do it because they were bad people who didn't want to learn, they did it because that's an acceptable way to solve conflict in their world. 

My students are normal teenagers who like music, fashion, and sports. I make an effort to talk to them about their hobbies, interests, and lives outside of school, and remember what they tell me. This shows them that you listen and it goes a long way in creating a positive atmosphere in the room.

I hate it when people act like my school is dangerous. I've never felt threatened by a student or unsafe in my school. Kids will curse and fight, but it's with each other and almost never directed toward a teacher. I've never been cussed out or even called a bitch, though some of my co-workers have and they make fun of me for being so ""nice"". Even with the situation with the gun, it was handled immediately by administration, and I seriously doubt that student planned to use it at school. That day I continued teaching my classes like nothing happened. The students who are in there to learn deserve to have a teacher who keeps it together and makes it happen.

Overall, it isn't an easy job. Teaching at my school is miles different than I expect it would be at the private high school I attended. However, I love what I do and feel I am actually having a positive impact in my students' lives. That feeling helps me deal with the worst days, and be thankful on the best days that I have the opportunity that I do."

For the most part, you seem set in your ways anyways, and I am not sure why you bothered to even ask this question, if you have already chosen what you are going to do. If it matters to you to reply to every person who messages you, then by all means do it!  Just don't get bullied into thinking that you owe everyone your attention.  People need to learn to do their own things that make them happy, and find their own meaning in life.  It is not your job to coddle every person you encounter, and in fact, that can be an exhausting and at times dangerous attitude to have about strangers. 

Men typically don't get as many messages as we do, and while a man may have to reply to just a couple of messages now and then, I don't see why you would feel obligated to answer dozens of messages on a regular basis. A quick ""Thank you for your lovely/unique/kind message, but I am not interested"" would suffice.  There is no point (for both you and the man) in wasting time talking to people you have no interest in.  Instead of trying to answer back all of these hundreds of messages you will receive that you are not interested in, why not use that time to actively find the person you DO want to be with?

silverionmox,europe,1390748858.0,"&gt;No, modern ecologically compliant products are more expensive, have higher margins and have the added benefit of not having to compete with non-eco products because those become illegal.

It's not as if there's not competition possible within ecological limits. That doesn't address the results on power consumption either.

&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10423431/EU-energy-saving-rules-cut-power-of-vacuum-cleaners.html

Wattage &lt;&gt; suction power. It's quite possible to build a vacuum cleaner that has more wattage but performs worse. We have to get rid of the idea that using more power automatically means better performance, and these norms are a good step in that direction. They have to compete on performance, not on powersucking.

&gt;Sry can't find a source for the car engine displacement, but ask any one that drove cars 20 years ago, and he will confirm it.

Anecdotes are not evidence. Hearsay is not an official regulation.

&gt;assesment of utily, go to the nearest auto dealer and drive the cheapest car they have, it's probably going to have a eco badge on it cause its simply bad marketing to say it's under-powered and do a drive test, find a hill and climb it.

Of course the cheapest car they have is going to underperform. What do you expect? That doesn't mean it's impossible to build a car that complies with the limitations and is still performant. The only difference is that that more performing care will be more expensive... what did you expect, really?

His main point in these talks is that dharma practice involves *skillfully* building up your sense of self to the point that you no longer need it and can leave it behind.  He suggests this was the Buddha's resolution to the question you pose (or something close to it).

1) Green Tea. No sugar, not over-brewed. Helps relieve the muscle soreness down there.

2) A heating pad. This thing does wonders. I usually rotate it between my back and stomach until I get some relief. 

3) Distractions. Pop in a movie/get some work done. The more you can focus on other things, the less you can feel your vagina trying to kill itself.

4) If you're having hot flashes/nausea, get a small personal fan. Sometimes some fresh air to your face will make you feel 100x more stable.

5) Especially with nausea, eliminate extremely scented things from whatever room you're in. Candles, perfume bottles, nail polish remover, etc. Personally I find the less artificial scents that I take in, the less nauseated I am.

6) Wash your face. Sometimes contraction-like cramps make you sweaty, and cooling your face off can help you mentally.

7) Mindset! It is especially important to know that the worst will be over soon. But with that, remember that it IS okay to feel pain and you of course have the right to cry and roll around. It's completely justified.

Good luck!

Now that's out of the way, I agree with /u/calicoan . Read the works of colourful writers, read all the classic literature you can get your hands on. But don't just read, them THINK about what you're reading. Analyse it, ""why did he use that metaphor?"" ""why did she phrase it in this way"". Read between the lines and get into the writer's head.

Then practice it, try and emulate some of the techniques they use and slowly encorporate them into your own writing/speaking (if you like them of course). 

This wasn't very easy for me and took some effort (I'm not a writer) but I can do it pretty comfortably now. Just remember to read decent literature.

KingNarcissus,AskMen,1390749367.0,"A little late to the party, but I've been keeping a journal for almost four years now. Here are some [low-quality pictures](http://imgur.com/a/nrn30) of it.

I was in nearly your exact same position when I started keeping it. First it was a tiny spiral notebook to write down my [horrible] screenplay ideas, then random thoughts, then after that I started writing down my thoughts for hours at a time. It gave me that structure and that time-perspective that you're talking about. (At one point I wrote ""I drift in an empty sea,"" much like how you feel now!) It also helped to unwind my brain and get things off my chest, especially at times in my life where I wasn't getting much social contact. Writing out my thoughts free-form, without worrying about sharing them with anyone else is incredibly therapeutic, it's great. That's reason enough to keep a journal.

The other big upside to keeping a journal is having perspective on *yourself*. You can read old entries and see exactly what you were fixated on at the moment, how you responded to external events, what you really wanted, what was important to you, and on and on. I've broken down the past four years of my life into different ""eras"" and I can see how I've grown from one to the next; sometimes in the matter of months or weeks. I'm writing a ""year in review"" for myself right now, and I have pages and pages of material to go back to; to see how I was feeling when I first met my ex, how I felt when we were at our high, when we broke up, when I was chasing tail for about five months afterwards, everything that went on this past year. And even better, I can go back over those times with a different perspective. How I feel about her and the relationship has changed dramatically over the past few months, just from reading and re-reading my entries from that time. Now extrapolate that to *every area* of your life, going all the way back to when you started journalling.

My advice - for the one person who does read down to the bottom of the page, haha - is to start small, with no expectations. I didn't set out to write a massive journal, I would just put my thoughts down with pen and paper, however they were. Publishing a blog is great but there's also a benefit to knowing that nobody ever has to see what you're writing. I've only shown a few pages - out of hundreds - to one person - my ex - and that was when I was with her, after I picked out a few I was okay with sharing. Just do it for yourself. 

Best of luck, and happy journalling!"

There are some genetic factors in humans, but those are also linked to causing overeating which in turn leads to weight gain http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16299561

There are some *rare* endocrine orders that cause obesity, certainly not at the 30+% rates we are seeing. 

There is some thought that gut flora can be implicated, which isn't that far fetched if you consider that the microbes are making food more digestible and absorbable and freeing up more calories in the process. So yes it could be genetics, just not human genetics. http://download.bioon.com.cn/view/upload/month_0909/20090915_62b3c1e410b1b0d6a398AaWjjQJFg1qh.attach.pdf

But in all of these cases at some level it's calories in versus calories out. Drugs or genes or other conditions may prompt you to over-consume calories but it's still the calories.

Or think of it this way, mass comes from mass. How does mass get into the system? Unless these folks have plant genes and are capable of photosynthesis they are not capable of making mass out of thin air and water.  You need carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen (plus other things in small quantities) to make tissue and only 2 of those come from water.

Intoxication is temporary, so if you must be intoxicated to view meditation as something that *isn't* a grueling chore, this is by extension a temporary mindset. Also by extension, any benefit achieved through this temporary mindset would also be temporary.

A ""grueling chore"" is something forced, something laborious and hard. Force has no place in meditation. Meditation should not be (and is not) laborious and hard. During meditation you gently train your mind, a little bit at a time you progress, and at some point you see lasting benefit. If you are doing anything but that, you are not meditating properly. If you are viewing meditation as anything but that, you are not viewing meditation properly. At least, in a traditional sense.

Neopopulas,dayz,1390749670.0,"Suggest anything to do with Quality of Life updates, a HUD, a grouping mechanic, or anything that gives you more clear information and watch what happens.

I once suggested having the hunger mechanic be less hidden, because i usually know how hungry i can and how full i am and all that and i had three people calling me a casual, and saying i should go play my kiddy games instead because DayZ is supposed to be hard, its supposed to be something you work against.

And you should constantly have to try and figure everything out yourself, but in the same breath use 'realism' as an excuse for things.. As if you don't know how hungry you are.

if you look around you see a lot of comments about how hard helicopters should be to fly, like realistically hard. There was a thread not long ago with lots of people saying how fixing cars and stuff should requite 'real world' experience.

I suggested once a sort of group system that could tell my who my friends were. Because the game can't realistically simulate all the little things (movement, body shape, small items on the body, how the walk and hold their gun, etc) to really tell me who is a friendly and who isn't. I just wanted a tiny indicator (that you could turn off if you wanted to be super hardcore).

I think it was that one that got 100+ upvotes but about five or so people were REALLY upset and spent the night telling me i was wrong and a noob and i should learn to play and the whole point of the game was the tension and the not knowing and i should just 'learn to tell my friend from enemies'. and so on. 

Someone said they wanted to be able to check a body and tell how they died, which sounds good, then a group of people started posted about how it should be visible on the body and you should have to basically guess via that, even though i doubt the system could even render that, and maybe not all graphics settings would have it. But a small text block on the right of the screen 'destroyed immersion and would ruin the feel of the game'

Despite the fact you get those with hunger and thirst already, and a inventory screen....

It seems some people want the game to be super hardcore, to hide information (like hunger) and to rely on player skill instead of the game assuming *character* skill, or knowledge. While these people are entitled to that opinion, i see a LOT of posts basically telling people they are wrong (or a noob, or bad at the game, or 'don't get DayZ' or should go and play something else like their opinion is less right) if they want a game that is LESS crazy hardcore. I'm all for making the game HARD.. its just.. complexity or difficulty doesn't always equal the game actively working against you, or hiding information, or things like that.

This went on a LOT longer than i meant it to.. but basically there seems to be two camps at the moment, and the community is going to be split no matter what, i think.. Until the game is finished, there will be two kinds of people who want two different things."

""Modern consensus"" is always a tricky term to use, due to the fact that everyone has a slightly different idea of what ancient combat (You refer to Rome) looked like - and I'm afraid that the most *accurate* answer we have is that we honestly can't imagine it. However, one predominant theory, championed by Adrian Goldsworthy, does agree with that sentiment. We know for a fact that the armies spent most of their time probing for weaknesses (Each army would form up on their preferred part of the battleground and dare the opponent to come to them - think of an ancient game of chicken). During this time, skirmishes would take place between the cavalry and skirmishers - and this could last for quite some time (days/weeks, depending). During this time, it wasn't just the armies facing each other that would sap the other army's morale - it was the supply situation (which is, incidentally, one of the reasons the Romans did so well in...for example...Gaul. The tribal armies didn't have an organized supply line, and while Caesar outran his every time he felt like it, Rome's system of logistics was BRILLIANTLY managed). The armies might be placed slightly closer to each other every time, until there was no choice but to fight - and then it was on. However, the stresses from being in close combat (physical and mental) for a protracted period of time would make it so that combatants would clash, trying to break each other, before seperating to catch their breath. During this time, they would toss any remaining projectile weapons at each other, as well as insults, taunts, etc. Then round two would begin!

The thing about Roman discipline is that it was in place to keep the men *fighting*. This backing off was still considered fighting - the men were just catching their breaths. Disciplined men were MUCH less likely to panic and break, which is when the killing in a battle truly began - which is one reason why our casualty figures in the ancient world were so incredibly lopsided. When men broke and routed, the slaughter would begin by the victorious army. Obviously, another issue here is when the victorious army gets too carried away and began to sack/loot/rape everything in sight - a situation which could give the defeated force time to rally and counterattack the now-scattered ""victors."" This was another example of Roman discipline, interestingly enough - the discipline to not ""go nuts"" after a battle. Even the Roman looting system was systematic and carefully controlled - which speaks volumes about why they did as well as they did :)

Hope that answers your question!"

SoyBeanExplosion,Metalcore,1390749861.0,"A lot of them can't distinguish between metalcore and post-hardcore, for one thing. Secondly, much of metalcore is antithetical to metal. Screaming fangirls? Tumblr fansites? Shitloads of merch? Band members run fashion lines? Very little artistic merit or DIY attitude either. These are generalisations sure but they hold true for a greater proportion of bands in this genre than in, say, death metal, or black metal, or progressive metal, just as some counter examples.

Honestly I feel that if some developer could come up with a way to do a kind of 'blind' YouTube play... like, a page where something off As I Lay Dying or Parkway Drive starts playing, but the person listening doesn't *know* the band playing it... I feel that it wouldn't get half the shit it does. But the thing about metal is that it's actually about more than just the music. It's about the culture and the attitude as well. I think the central objection much of /r/metal has to metalcore is that, really, these criticisms about breakdowns etc. are secondary - they're tools that bands use so that they can play music *as a means to an end*. They play music *so that* they can get groupies and get on Warped Tour and signed to Rise Records, etc. Not because they have a passion for their music. In the metal genre, there's a heavy emphasis on the age-old idea of artists suffering for their work. Metalcore doesn't really have that. If you can knock together a half-decent song between a few guys who look like they could be in a boy-band, get signed to Rise, you're sorted. It's pretty much the culture surrounding it that is antithetical to the metal culture and that's why there's such a vitriolic response.

At least IMO anyway."

Well, most research I see these days is definitely bio-inspired to some extent. But that might be because it's the path of least resistance - after all, we have no idea how to make intelligence appear in software, so it makes sense to work on the only model we have.

Yorick - His Ghouls can protect add from skill shots, like Lee or Thresh, his ult is great in team fights and he has some nice sustain and poke, even though he has to go near his enemies. It's hard to pull off, but if you manage to get a lead he is awesome.

Nautilus - very tanky, actually has high burst on lvl 2 people like to underestimate. And of course secured banks with his cc. I like to get boots of mobility at lvl 6 and roam to mid.
