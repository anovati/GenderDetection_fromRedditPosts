&gt;Don't tell him what to do. If you want to wear pajamas outside, fuckin wear em. It all depends what you expect from that. Of course you won't get a blonde party chic but there will be at least one crazy girl out there who likes that shit.

First of all, OP asked for advice, so of course I'm going to tell him what to do. That's how advice works. Second, do you really think being a social outcast is desirable? ""Ooh, if I dress like an autistic pariah and don't listen to any sane person's feedback, I can get a crazy (read: ugly and just as undesirable) girl for me! Wow! Why would anyone want to improve at all if they can bag 3/10's with no effort?"" Don't you think that, evidenced by his request for advice, OP is looking to change himself to avoid that exact situation? Everyone likes when people put effort in to things. Effort brings results, and results are attractive. End of story.

&gt;As long as you don't offend anyone with your style, do what you like. Men wear skirts in Scotland, nobody would wear that in Arabia, yet the wear turbans there, no american would wear that right? You don't need to adapt on every shit other people do, but you have to live with the consequences.
If you want to look rebellious, fuckin do that. What matters (and I say it again) is what you expect. No businessman will like that outfit. Yet you will gather freaks around you.

I have to say it took me a while to understand what you're trying to say here. Your sentence structure is horrid and your grammar is abysmal. You might want to wait to comment on ""big boy websites"" like this one until you've graduated middle school. Ad hominems aside, I'll address your points above. So you're saying that different cultures have different styles of dress, and while those styles of dress may be locally acceptable, they do not translate as well into the international spectrum. Yes, that makes sense. In fact, it seems that the excerpt above is just you proving my point. You even say that businessmen will not respect me if I wear socially unacceptable clothing, and that my peers will be determined by my style of living. That is all correct, and that proves my point. If someone dresses like an outcast, they're going to be treated like an outcast, and they're going to make outcast friends. On the other hand, if someone dresses in a socially acceptable manner, they will be accepted by those who choose to abide by society's base standards (read: most normal people).

However, I know my boyfriend very well. We are best friends, we started out as best friends. He connects better romantically with someone he is mentally/emotionally stimulated with. So him being emotionally close with another woman just isn't a good idea. 

I trust him. To a point. We've had a few little bumps in the road with trust so I'm not 100% there. But, to add to that, I don't trust girls. I have met too many manipulative women and I know that they would love to sink their teeth into my man. He's kind, smart, and good looking. I know for a fact many many women have crushes on him, which is great because he's mine but at the same time, makes me uncomfortable because he's so kind he might not even realize what he's getting into. Does that make sense? He can be kind of niave in that sense, he doesn't know how to say no sometimes and wants to help everyone. Which is part of the reason why I'm attracted to him but part of the reason that leaves me a little concerned when he's one on one with a girl.

He has a girl friend from high school that he's hung out with before and that was not weird, just because she's been around way before me. She's just a buddy and always will be. I think if he made a new girl friend and got close to her it would definitely be an unusual experience."

llamallamalizard,LongDistance,1388982761.0,"Others have pretty much covered what I can say for the most part, but I'll say it anyway in case I can help add some insight. I'm diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar subtype. I've been there, where your SO is. You see, when you're depressed, you don't perceive the world like other people do. Everything sucks. It can vary from person to person from wanting to just not exist and you see yourself as a burden to everyone around you, to being emotionally numb, to just not being able to be happy no matter what. I've been all of these. It is painful and terrifying. You can feel totally and completely alone even when you aren't. You feel worthless, like you're dragging everyone down, so you isolate. I had times when I wouldn't talk to people for weeks except for saying just what I had to to get by. 

I can almost guarantee you he's not hiding anything from you, what he's likely doing is isolating. He's scared that you see him how he sees himself and he's frightened that he'll lose the only good thing he has right now. I'll warn you right now that being with someone who is dealing with depression is hard work. It's difficult and frustrating, especially if you don't understand what it feels like... but that doesn't mean it's not worth it. What you have to gauge is whether you can be strong for him. If you are willing to be his strength when he's weak and scared and lonely, then you can be the best thing to have ever happened to him. If you can't... you have to let him go, and be as kind as you possibly can, be his friend and encourage him to seek treatment. It's a good sign he's been to a doctor, it means he either has a strong support system who is helping him get help, or that he knows that he needs help and is motivated enough to seek it himself. It took me a suicide attempt before I'd agree to seek help. 

And yes, actually, it makes perfect sense to me, anyway, that he'd be hesitant to see you. As wonderful as the time you'd spend together would be for him, he knows that once he notices the stark difference between his daily life that is just incredibly miserable and the joy that you bring to him, it will make him much, much more depressed when he goes back to his normal life after you leave. It might not make sense to you if you've never been depressed, but trust me, it's something he's scared about. It's not that he doesn't want to see you, it's that he's scared that when you leave, things will get so much worse for him. 

Side note: While it's generally gaining acceptance and understanding in society, depression still has a pretty intense stigma for a lot of people, hence him being embarrassed actually makes a great deal of sense, not that he should be, but that it's understandable. 



This is what I usually link people to when they ask about depression. Allie explains it very, very well.

This thread is also a very good look at what depression can feel like to different people:

If you need any more help or insight, feel free to message me. Your SO is going through a very hard time right now, and I have some knowledge of what it feels like to be incredibly depressed. It gets better but it is a hell of a fight to get there. There are days when I'm down and I can barely get out of bed, but I am so much better than I was. Whether you stay together or not, please, please, make sure he stays okay. Be his friend even if you can't be his girlfriend. He's fragile, and needs support, and if you can offer that, please do.

Comma20,snowboarding,1388982772.0,"Generally speaking most people go to Queenstown or Wanaka and hub it from there. There's no real 'on piste' for any of the resorts, so you have to take a 30min - 1hour bus ride to make it over. Almost all major accommodation or travel agents can sort this out for you. 

Queenstown is closer to ""The Remarkables"" and ""Coronet Peak"" whilst Wanaka is closer to ""Treble Cone"" and ""Cardrona"" as well as a little place called ""Snow Park"". I'd rate Treble Cone for the chutes on the backside of the mountain. Coronet is pretty average, Remarkables has some nice less used routes on the back side too. Cardies is generally solid for everything and has a decent park. Snow park is sick if you just wanna do park laps, but doesn't offer anything else (Although the restaurant is awesome and the staff are all amazing).

Queenstown is a bit more party-party town, since it's so touristy, and you can do a lot of non-boarding related activities (Bungie Jumping, Shotover Jet). You MUST get pizza from a place called Winnies. It's the best I've ever had (albeit expensive). Fergburer is also dope. 

Mountains in NZ are protected above a certain height so the lifts aren't that high and there's no real guarantee of good snow, so powder days are few and far between, unless you want to spent ~$500-$1000 on a day worth of good helis in the Harris mountain ranges.

Just like if someone used to be fat, or had cancer, or got a boob job, nose job, ect it's their business. With that being said there are few and far in between who don't actually disclose that they're trans in a romantic setting. It bothers me how reddit gives off this appearance that trans people are out to trick you and will randomly say ""oh, I have a penis"" just as your about to have sex. That doesn't happen that often considering most trans people are mindful of others and their own time. If you don't want me, why waste my time. Add on to the fact that most are mindful of the fact that they'd get their ass beat/killed if they sprung that shit on someone.  So please don't pull the card you pulled, because it's starting to become a trans people do this instead of a shitty person did that kind of thing.

If you're new to Media Criticism in general it could be hard to explain. It also gets more complicated when you're dealing with Auteur Theory, which is the idea that everything in a given work is the result of a singular creative vision. If Kojima is anything, he's an auteur.

Try and think of it this way: If you wanted to paint a picture of a kitchen, and you deliberately wanted that painting to provoke people into thinking about, let's say ""resource consumption"", you might have a whole lot of takeaway trash on the counter while some old vegetables are rotting in an open fridge.

You want to be as truthful as possible about your idea and paint something that reflects reality (even though the subject of the painting itself is fiction - the kitchen doesn't exist in reality) so maybe it seems natural to have some empty beer bottles wedged into some empty McDonald's fries boxes.  That's what some people do. With me so far?

Someone comes along to analyse your art, and says ""oh wow, the beer juxtaposed with the fries. It seems like a comment on how grain as a crop has enabled us to consume low quality food to excess in spite of poverty"".  Now, you never meant to make that specific statement intentionally, or at least consciously. But the fact in that statement is true, and it's also relevant and part of the overall statement you were making. By painting a consistent truth, where every element is coherent with this truth, then it stands to reason that those elements combined should also point to truths *that you may not have intentionally tried to include*. 

I just pulled that out of my ass so I hope it makes sense.  Personally I'm of the opinion that Kojima is very intentional about these little things because he *always* pays attention to the little things. Melting ice cubes, exploding watermelons, hidden jokes in the tiniest, weirdest places, content that only triggers under very specific circumstances: these are Kojimas clues to us that everything has been put in these games by hand, very carefully, because he can't just come out and say it without ruining his artistic credibility (probably in his own eyes more than anything).

TLDR: Don't feel bad, art is weird."

But basically your root note always feels like home, but there is a special circumstance where the minor second of a key can fool you into thinking that it is the key too.  This song uses this special characteristic of the minor second and reinforces it by using chromatic notes.

edit-  you know how a lot of songs have rhythm guitar playing something like this on the lowest string?-

Whether or not the truth is attainable for everything depends on your philosophical views.  

For example, people used to think the Earth was flat. Then people thought it was spherical. Then people thought it was a slightly squashed sphere. Then people thought it was a slightly squashed sphere that is a little bit bigger on one side, like a pear (only nowhere near that extreme). 

Are the people who think the Earth is spherical just as wrong as the people who think it's flat? No, spherical is more correct, even though it isn't quite exact. 

On a side note, evolution comes from mutations, changes in the DNA sequence. These come from random errors in DNA replication or mutagenic components in the environment (might be more sources, but I don't know for sure). "

Since the targeted aircraft's jamming fooled the radar into thinking it was the missile it had just launched, the missile never got any guidance commands and just flew a ballistic path and crashed back to earth.

I studied accounting and really enjoyed working through the problems we did in class and learning all kinds of things, but when it came time to enter the real world of actually having an accounting job, I was hit with the harsh reality that a job as an accountant is *far* from studying accounting in college. What we did in class wasn't what accountants actually do all day. I learned that I hated dealing with stupid clients, asshole bosses and being stuck in an office all day. I'm not saying this is the case for all majors, I'm just saying make sure you're aware of what the career will really be like, pick a career you will enjoy, and study whatever will help you achieve that career. Good luck :)

Also, I second the other commenter's notion that a bachelors degree in psychology is more or less worthless. It will not get you a job unless you make some *really* good connections. If you plan on getting a masters then maybe keep psychology as an option. Still take some psych classes as electives though because it's fascinating.

I think a mature person is someone who has respect for other people and their opinions, can use critical thinking, and always seeks to be educated, to name a few. People learn these values through interacting with other people. With the increasing popularity of the internet, it's increasingly more difficult for teenagers to *not* learn these values, since they are encountering hundreds of different people daily.

Of course, there are always going to be the fools who think they are mature. But there will also be those who are actually mature and know it. Both will tell you they are mature, so how do you tell the difference? Get to know the person. Ask their opinion on certain topics. Anything that will test whether they are actually mature or not. If you just assume that all teenagers are immature, you're bound to insult many of the ones who are mature. I'm not insulted, though. I understand why so many people think we're immature.

m00nh34d,australia,1388983116.0,"Sell off Medibank, sure. It's probably not going to be that detrimental to consumers (considering it's usually pretty average on rates anyway). There's also plenty of pre-existing competition there, and it's (kind of) working (ok, it *isn't* working, but the government's ownership of Medibank Private has nothing to do with that).

Sell off Aus Post, and (more) energy companies? Get farked. Just look at Victoria for an example of how to screw over consumers. We have a privatised energy ""market"" now. There's no competition though. I mean, who's going to build new power and gas infrastructure to compete? The people that own that infrastructure are a monopoly. You have this illusion of competition by having all these ""retailers"" selling you energy, but all they do is add to the cost, the don't provide any service (other than what's needed to maintain you as a customer).

Aus Post will be just the same. Why on earth would companies try and compete in areas that make a loss? Delivery to the middle of the outback? Yeah, dreaming. Much more profitable to stick to major cities. It will end up very similar to Telstra. Just look at all the great competition we have in telecommunications in this country. We have a universal service provider being forced to maintain unprofitable products and markets, and at the same time obstructing smaller providers that want to compete in the profitable sector. All while cutting costs, so as to maximise profits for shareholders.

We should be doing the opposite here. Anything that is a natural monopoly should be government owned. All that ends up happening is we give the ACCC powers to monitor a monopoly, setting prices, then we end up with a more expensive service than we had previously, but now instead of the profits going back to all Australians (being the owners) it goes back to the shareholders of the company."

cyberdark10,AdviceAnimals,1388983202.0,"Yeah, banning guns will drop gun accidents a lot, but the rise of crime will counteract that*. 
Sweden's gun laws are more lenient than what I'm talking about. Personally I think that Sweden's gun laws are still too tight, but it's better than the complete weapons ban that most anti-gun activists are talking about. 

* The reason for Canada's, and the UK's low violent crime rate is unknown. 
Even before anti-gun laws started getting passed in 1903 (The Pistols Act of 1903) the crime rate was low in the UK.  It's the same thing with Canada. 

In Australia, after the 1996 National Firearms Agreement was passed crime continued to rise. 
&gt; In 2002 — five years after enacting its gun ban — the Australian Bureau of Criminology acknowledged there is no correlation between gun control and the use of firearms in violent crime. In fact, the percent of murders committed with a firearm was the highest it had ever been in 2006 (16.3 percent), says the D.C. Examiner.

Not only that, but in 2006, the Australian Bureau of Criminology measured that violent crime rose by about 40%.
&gt;   2006, assault rose 49.2 percent and robbery 6.2 percent.
Sexual assault — Australia’s equivalent term for rape — increased 29.9 percent.
Overall, Australia’s violent crime rate rose 42.2 percent.

Percy goes down if he's hit on a very small spot on the small of his back. But good luck hitting it. It's maybe 4 square inches of weakness. Kratos, for all of his combat experience, moves at the speed of a very fast normal human in every incarnation. Percy moves at super-human speeds (faster than GoW's Hermes) and is extremely good with the sword. He can waterbend nearby lakes and rivers, and only needs water to heal. Kratos can be killed by normal swords. Percy can summon hurricanes and direct the lightning from it. Percy's just OP as fuck in this fight. If we're bringing in all of both character's magic and gimmicks, [Percy's aresnal is by no means small.](http://camphalfblood.wikia.com/wiki/Percy_Jackson#Abilities_and_Items) [His innate abilities are listed here.](http://camphalfblood.wikia.com/wiki/Percy_Jackson#Abilities_and_Items)

I just don't see Percy losing. I've played through all of GoW and read most of Riordan's books, and Percy is just on another level.

You are attractive. You keep yourself clean and have ambition. The basic requirements for most women is that their man can support themselves. Ambition is a bonus.

For shows, Black Sheep is the place, but you'll want to look up their schedule rather than just stopping by. Pick up a copy of The Independent or walk into one of the Independent Records to see what's coming up. For such a divey venue it gets some really great acts roll through.

Wonderful_Toes,saplings,1388983949.0,"What /u/WarmFire said is really important: weed is cool and great and makes you happy, but it can have *seriously* detrimental effects, which are only multiplied the younger the smoker is. I can't exactly put you down for smoking at your age (I first tried when I was 15, but didn't really start until I was 16, which is still very young), but do at least consider/be aware of the effects, and definitely don't smoke ""too much"". When your brain is fully developed it gets much, much safer to smoke, but until you're ~18 your it's still in full development.

As for your current predicament, I think that (if your friend's mom does contact your parents about this), I think you should accept that sometimes you can't work your way out of shit, but can minimize the damage by owning up and being honest. Your friend's mom has more than enough evidence against you, so if she does contact your parents, you'll only make it worse for yourself by denying it. Admit that you smoked weed, take the punishment (which will likely be reasonable, because parents are insanely good at these things), and don't fuck up next time.

An animal will react more closely to a human than an cell culture.

Define critical research? Because there really isn't any other way to test prototype drugs and health based hypothesis without using a living organism. The amount of control given to the researchers by using animals is so much larger than on humans.

mintyJulips,AskWomen,1388984282.0,"I think one of the keys is that he acts pretty much the same with new acquaintances as he does with old friends. Even though the topic of conversation may differ with new people, the tone is the same as it is with old friends...it's very comfortable and broken in, which puts people at ease. I think this comes from being confident and comfortable with one's self more than anything. 

And yeah, women love him. I think it's because he doesn't automatically treat them like potential SO's or hookups. It doesn't feel like he's trying to charm them by putting calculated moves on them. So no strategic touching or mind games. He treats them the same as he does everyone else. He also grew up around a lot of girls, so I'm sure that plays a role in how comfortable he is with them. 

Of course, all of this hinges on the fact that he's witty and a good conversationalist. I think these things can be learned to a certain extent, but some of it is just innate. 

Oh, and I've noticed he's very good about remembering names. He can meet a person once, and then see them a few weeks later and address them by name and seem genuinely happy to see them again. People seem to respond to this.

 He wasn't always out-going. He was never really shy, just nervous, whiny, and could be straight up annoying. He's the opposite of that now.

Ok, before we start off again. I want to say that I'm finding it very difficult to keep any sort of order in the points I should address so sorry for that.

__

&gt;*Your second comment is just ridiculous. Shape my channel on my ability to deliver witty remarks? Because I added a little flavour text in one 20 minute video, just for a laugh, I now need to reshape my entire channel? I wont go any further in to how silly a remark this is.* 

I think I've said enough on this point already. TL;DR: You would have already redone your entire channel if you truly believed that the extra sarcastic remarks added value to your video. This is also why I didn't believe that these remarks were your sense of humour but whatever.

&gt;*PS Might I just say, cards on the table here, your feedback is kind of rude? I know I should probably leave my comment here, but I think it's only fair.*

Quoting this really makes no sense since I know you've read my first post to the throwaway that has deleted his posts. (This is getting kind of confusing by now. :) ). Whatever, I'm gonna quote it anyway just to say that I think it was fair, seeing as you read my reply to you in a condescending fashion.

The next parts don't seem that important to me so, knowing Nilesy apparently isn't extremely pissed at me, I'm just gonna tone down the seriousness a bit. I'm gonna go over the other parts real quick just to make the post as complete as possible and also because I don't want to give the impression that I ignored the other parts or that I wanted to pick my battles and not comment on the other parts.

&gt;*Then you say, ""flippant use of afteredited words"", flippant meaning thoughtless? Now that's just insulting, the video had gosh without checking maybe 8-10 little additions over 20 minutes, so maybe 1 every 2 minutes? Flippant would suggest I threw them in carelessly and with abandon, like I didn't give a shit about the content I was producing. Kinda rude, and also not correct, I just added fun quips which I was thinking back while editing.*

&gt;*Did I think it was a weaker video? Yeah, I do actually. LEGO games are meant to be co-op, and with local only that's impossible, so already it's a bit of a downer, and I get stuck on puzzles very easily, so that can annoy people too, my idea to add flavour text was a minor attempt at diffusing that, and keeping it light.*

Yep and I understand that. However, as I said in my post to the now deleted comments of the throwaway account (as directed by M. Night Shyamalan.), the comments felt very forced to me.

I will not argue with you, the video felt weaker than your regular ones to me. It might've just been me though, my heart wasn't really into it either. I'm personally not doing the best at the moment. I'm writing this at 5:30 AM and I was just looking for a quick escape from life to be honest. The Internet and YouTube in particular is such an easy escape as well.

&gt;*Plus, you don't think I'm a sarcastic guy? I am. I'm using the word ""sarcastic"", which a little more flattering than the demeaning ""snarky"" which you used. In solo content, talking to myself, I even come across that way too, but yeah I'm a very sarcastic guy, maybe you've not picked up on that before.* 

Nope, I didn't, as I, for anyone reading, explained extensively in my reply to the throwaway.

&gt;*Your ""feedback"" doesn't really come across as helpful opinion, it comes across as a teacher/adult chastising a child, which I am not. I wouldn't have felt the need to respond had you just said something like ""Wasn't a fan of the new flavour text, personally!"" I would have taken it on board along with everyone else's opinions, but you were backhandedly rude, and so I responded.* 

Sorry, I know it's dumb to hide behind the fact that English isn't my first language but I will do just that. English isn't my first language. Of course, everyone tries to be a Shakespeare on the Internet. Most people want to give the best impression possible, especially on the Internet, meaning you have to be ""a gentleman and a scholar"", to say it in Reddit's terms.

People of different countries generally try to do their best when it comes to English, getting braver and braver and varying things up as they go. Until their hubris catches up to them and they fall flat on their face, as just happened with me right now. I misunderstood the finer nuances of some words, resulting in a fiasco if words are the only thing to go by. My outlandish sentence composition stems from studying Latin though so I won't allow anyone to hate on that. I just automatically switch to this really Archaic style when I have to discuss things on the Internet. I'm not delibaretly trying to confuse people, although the way they handle it does provide an insight into the mind of my discussion partner. :)

&gt;*Anyway, hope this answers your questions.* 

It definitely does. I'm sorry for being such a bother to you. By the way, the only reason I took such a long time to write this reply is because I have some social anxiety as well, although not as severe as you obviously. I couldn't stand the fact that you were thinking negative things about me so I had to clear things up. I am sorry for bothering you, however, know that I have screwed you over as much as I have screwed over myself. The reason I was awake in the first place is because I had to study for a test, which I am now probably gonna fail. 

If you made it this far, know that I do not expect another reply. Also know that I really enjoy your content, you are my favourite yogscaster by far.

So yeah, many hearts to you as well, Nilesinator. &lt;3 &lt;3

EDIT: I should probably TL;DR it a bit. My answer to Nilesy, which may have been perceived as condescending or negative by people, actually wasn't intended to be condescending at all. The bottomline is that I was trying to give an opinion on an aspect of Nilesy's video. Then I was trying to make it clear that I did not expect him to listen to me at all. I know that my opinion is worthless when it comes to the grand scheme of things and that is the message I was trying to get accross. I was trying to say that if the majority of people liked it, that he should go for it. I was trying to devalue my own opinion in case he thought too much of it."

I think that's normal for him to be worried that he talked you into something that wasn't what you wanted. It shows that he's an attentive husband who cares about your desires. 

Try to find a way to demonstrate that you don't want to have kids. I'm not talking about getting your tubes tied or anything, but you need to demonstrate to him that you've thought about it and there are things about having kids that you object to.

As to feeling like you'd want to keep the baby if you were a surrogate: I'm sure you would. That doesn't mean you want to have kids. That means you have a maternal instinct that wouldn't stop just because your rational mind doesn't want kids. So tell your husband that."

That's all assuming that this guy even has been friendzoned because it's not clear from this video that he even does have any romantic feelings for his friend.

And there are plenty of careers centered around travel which people who are grown-ups actually do for a living. All I'm saying is that you probably have some hobbies or interests that make you happy and that are really important to your happiness and mental health. Travel is simply one of those for me. It doesn't have to be expensive, I can stay in hostels or camp in tents, but it is important to me.

It looked as if some girlfriend found her man's old stash of porn and hucked them out of the highrise window.  Anyway, the 3 ladies were: One that looked EXACTLY like Church Lady, you really could not tell if it was a man or a woman clothed, but was def a woman naked with a huge bush, One that was a tall skinny black haired lady, also a huge bush but TINY TINY tits, and a 3rd obese black lady with a huge bush.  All very explicit in different poses, some single, some together, some with a guy.  Anyway, I collected a few of them and mailed them as jokes to my friends (this was 1997).  I also put them in between the glass and the paper of Chicago Tribune news boxes, so instead of seeing the paper you'd see the polaroids.  I sat and watched as people did double takes left and right.  So damn funny.  Anyway, every single time I put one of the black lady out, someone would put quarters in and take the pic, but not a paper.  So my theory is that a lot of people like 50yo sistas with big hairy bushes."

OliverProbert,sportsbook,1388985215.0,"I think that's a fair point to make. Syracuse rushed the ball 50 times against FSU and only gained 146 yards, which is poor. Boston College are also a run-oriented team that didn't score a TD on the ground against FSU.

But that being said, and having watched the game, I think the strong running numbers at least *helped* BC score 34 against FSU. BC succeeded this year because it had a good running game and was really secure in the passing game - 17 TD and just 8 INT on the season. Syracuse, meanwhile, had 13 TD and 17 INT through the air.

What I'm saying is that with Auburn, you have like a supercharged version of Boston College - first in the nation in rushing, and very similar passing numbers (18 TD, 7 INT) - *and* they've done it against much tougher opposition than BC. When you combine all those factors, I just don't think they'll struggle to score, and I obviously don't think FSU will struggle to score, either."

The question is always two-fold. One, is she worth the effort? Two, are you really willing to spend your life supplying the drug that she demands?

I always tell guys to watch the Dr. Phil Show. No for Phil, because he's a blue pill apologist if there ever was one, but for the opportunity to just soak in the nightmarish levels of alpha addiction that some women crave. There are women so hooked on alpha game that nothing short of a truly godless beatdown fills the void. You really wanna be the guy on the hook for supplying that? You wanna be the guy who spends the next two years having to apologize to her family for what she wants?

Let's be honest . . . if hardcore sluttery were simply about how many dicks a girl could take, it wouldn't be a problem to anyone except her gynecologist. But the brutal truth of the matter is that the really out-there chicks are after something much harder to acquire: the pure, uncut alpha.

I'm all for C-sections if it is the safer route (emergency, mother is HIV+, baby physically wont fit through mothers pelvis, etc), but in a healthy pregnant woman, it is safer to deliver vaginally.

C-sections come with much longer recovery time, prolonged pain, greater physical restrictions ordered by your MD (no lifting over a gallon of milk, no driving, etc), incresed risk of infection, other surgical complications like reaction to anesthesia, bleeding out, blood clots that can lead to PE or stoke, and many more terrible unnecessary things you don't want to have to worry about when trying to take care of your brand new baby.

IndependentBoof,changemyview,1388985371.0,"That's a significant step back from your earlier claim, but that's fair enough if you wish to revise your argument.

Marijuana -- like any drug -- will have side effects. Ultimately, the measurement of whether it is ""harmful"" is whether or not it can be used safely where its benefits outweigh its detriments. There are no studies that suggest significant long-term effects from moderate use. Meanwhile, there are studies that have found meaningful medical use in treating muscle spasms, nausea, loss of appetite, seizures, and Crohn's disease. Currently, it is hard to make the case that in those situations, when used as treatment, that it is ""harmful.""

Some may argue that more research needs to be done to determine if there are potential long-term effects of moderate (or seldom) use. However, until that research has been done and sufficient evidence is shown, it is premature to suggest that it is harmful to use marijuana as a medical treatment or even in moderation by recreation."

Katterin,cheatatmathhomework,1388985411.0,"For any amount of food A that you purchase, you can calculate the nutrients that you still need:

P = 9 - 3A    
C = 11 - 5A    
F = 8 - A

And the amount of Food B that it would take to satisfy those requirements:

Bp = 9 - 3A    
Bc = (11 - 5A)/2    
Bf = (8-A)/3    

The minimum amount of B you need to purchase is the maximum of (0, Bp, Bc, Bf).

Once one of Bp, Bc, or Bf falls below zero, we don't need to consider it anymore.  This happens at the following values:

Bp is negative when A &gt; 3    
Bc is negative when A &gt; 2.2    
Bf is negative when A &gt; 8    

We can also set Bp &gt; Bc, or 9 - 3A &gt; (11-5A)/2.  This solves to A &gt; 7.  At values of A &gt; 7, both Bp and Bc are negative - so neither one can be the max value of (0, Bp, Bc, Bf) that we are looking for.

At values below 7, we now know that Bp will always be greater than Bc.  So, Bc will never be the max value of (0, Bp, Bc, Bf), as at least one of (0, Bp) will always be greater than Bc.

Now let's compare Bp and Bf:
Bp &gt; Bf    
9 - 3A &gt; (8 - A)/3    
A &lt; 2.375    

We know that for A &lt; 3, Bp &gt; 0 and Bp &gt; Bc.  Now we also know that for A &lt; 2.375, Bp &gt; Bf.  So, for 0 &lt; A &lt; 2.375, Bp must be the max of (0, Bp, Bc, Bf).

For 2.375 &lt; A &lt; 8, we know that Bf &gt; 0, Bf &gt; Bp, and Bp &gt; Bc which implies Bf &gt; Bc.  So for 2.375 &lt; A &lt; 8, the max value of (0, Bp, Bc, Bf) must be Bf.

So given A, the amount of B needed is:

9 - 3A, if 0 &lt; A &lt; 2.375    
(8 - A)/3, if 2.375 &lt; A &lt; 8    
0, if 8 &lt;= A    

Substituting these values for B in cost = 9A + 5B, we get the following for the total cost:

45 - 6A, if 0 &lt; A &lt; 2.375    
(22A + 40) / 3, if 2.375 &lt; A &lt; 8    
9A, if 8 &lt; A    

Looking at the slope of each segment, we see that the cost is decreasing from 0 to 2.375, then increasing for all values greater than 2.375.  So, the minimum cost must be at A = 2.375, and B = 9 - 3(2.375) = 1.875."

If she was just joking about it, then there would be a serious reaction. She could then tell them that she was joking and it was actually an accident. There still might be some who don't believe her and call the police, so if that's the case, then there would be some harm done.

thebumm,offmychest,1388985524.0,"It was some video of a stand-up comedian on Upworthy, which usually has decent stuff, that set me off. He was misusing it, to mean black comedians (he was Middle Eastern, I believe - I listened on mobile) saying white jokes and he was discussing his white friends saying that's reverse racism. That minorities can joke about whites is reverse racism. Which is misusing the term, but either way, it's bull.


I think it's dumb that a white dude making a joke is racist but a minority can get away with it. Either no one makes the joke or everyone should. The term ""nigger"" chaps my ass too, because I'm white, I won't say it, I respect that. But black guys can call me honky and cracker and cockroach and none of those are bleeped or ""racist"".

And this guy went *off* about this, about how whites oppressed and this and that, and sure, yes they did, overall and some still do. But some black guys are still more racist than most white people. A lot of black guys are more affluent now than a lot of white people. The slavery and oppression that he's siting is in the past and the quicker people move on from it the more people can be comfortable being around other races and cultures. I don't need to be reminded (and especially not guilt tripped) that people that had a similar pigment as me did horrid things to people with darker skin. I get it, it happened. I had nothing to do with it, though, and why someone would resent and mock me over that, that happened with people I have never known, is atrocious.


I hold my own sense of humor, and really sense of self, above all that crap. And I believe his ""friends"" that he talks about have a good point. Most of the time people complaining about racism are the ones perpetuating the ideas and stereotypes, rather than the ones looking for a solution.


It *really* ticked me off to see it on the same site I saw a great video about the same idea, a hidden camera-type gag with a black girl ragging on a white girl for dating a black guy and watching as strangers, other black people, defend interracial relationships. *That's* inspiring, *that's* good, not just dragging all white people through the mud. Especially since, historically, America isn't the only place with slaves in its history, blacks weren't the only race enslaved, and slaves still exist elsewhere, while America has abolished it.

Thjoth,ar15,1388985539.0,"Because any relevant experience regarding firearms (military/LE/hunting/target/etc) that you're going to gain in your life, will have almost entirely been gained by the time you're in your 30s.  On top of that, just because the people talking are older doesn't mean they have the slightest clue what they're actually talking about (see:  Fudds when talking about anything that isn't a bolt action) and I've found that older guys tend to be stuck about 20 years behind everyone else when giving out gun advice (eg. ""Colt is the best manufacturer of AR-15s,"" yeah, maybe in the 80s before the AR boom, gun shop guy, but I think KAC, LWRC, Noveske, and LMT have something to say here).

So you take all of that and combine it with the baseless hostility and general disregard for younger customers that most display, and the rather disturbing number of them (at least here locally) who are tryhard posers that dodged the draft for Vietnam, and I don't have a ton of automatic age-based respect for the local gunshop owner.  He needs to show me that he actually has a clue before I listen to anything he has to say.

Incidentally, one of the best LGS owners in my area is a guy who's in his 60s I guess, who volunteered for the USMC at the beginning of Vietnam.  He's kept up on modern gun technology, technique, and competition, as well as his experience in Vietnam and he really knows his shit.  Beyond him, I go to the trendy younger gun shop because they also know what they're talking about and don't treat me like some dumb kid who's never handled a gun in his life."

&gt;That's the difference between ""rents"" and rental services.

Under this logic, how is renting a house or apartment different from renting a backhoe or jackhammer?

edit: for clarification I think that women on reddit can sometimes forget to turn off ultra-defensive mode, because we deal with blatant sexism a lot... so think of it not as downvoting the comment ""girls are selfie-obsessed"" but the attitude surrounding it... but again, *SHRUG* totally spectating here. /ramble

Natsume, the main character, is genuinely a nice guy who tries to help out others but finds it hard to trust because of his past, while Madara (""Nyanko-sensei"") toes the line between jerk and good-guy. It's a very heartwarming series with a lot of feels.

[Dennou Coil](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2164/Dennou_Coil) is a step up in the action department, although there isn't any gore at all.

CrabCow,Warthunder,1388985871.0,"The problem with the air combat that I have is indeed the damage. If anyone saw I posted an image of a bomber somehow still intact and flying despite unloading 100% of my ammunition in my BF-109 F-4. While all of them didn't hit, I am confident I landed at least 40 20mm shells onto that plane. There's no way it'd be intact after that.

Now, I am a huge flight sim fan and I can't live without my IL-2 Sturmovik 1946. Damage was correct. If I hit the son of a bitch with two 30mm cannons in the ME-163 Komet, you're damn right that wing ain't staying on that plane. (EDIT: 163, not 183...)

Interestingly enough, my father who enjoys taking turns flying with me on War Thunder and IL-2 Sturmovik 1946, has told me that Gaijin has purchased the intellectual property of IL-2 Sturmovik. So let me ask you this, Gaijin.

**Why do you attempt to fix something that is not broken?** The game was fine, I would be okay with a simple re-skin of it with the system War Thunder had in 1.35 or earlier. The exp and level system was good. RP? A bit flawed in places. (Four tier IV planes just for a jet? You're not getting anything else after that mistake of throwing $25 at you all)

Matchmaking makes no sense? Tiers don't make sense, levels don't make sense. You know what DOES make sense? Years. Every time a new plane came out, other nations had to counter. If you did a tier for every year (1942 planes for example?) with appropriate nations fighting each other (America vs. Russia in 1940 planes my ass) that would end significantly better than whatever we have now.

Bots are a problem as well, which my proposed change to matchmaking could solve. I love me some good flying but 4 players and **6 bots**? Come on.

I cannot believe I defended 1.37's release at the start. After all of this, even I have had enough Gaijin.

We already invented the wheel, there is no need to reinvent it."

On the bright side, when I first heard this advice, ways to expose yourself as a writer such as by using blogs and self-publishing didn't exist. Nowadays, you have options!

[Here's my favourite guide](http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2013/08/13/25-steps-to-being-a-traditionally-published-author-lazy-bastard-edition/) on how to become a published author. Ultimately, you have to find a way of writing that works for you. There are no right ways or wrong ways, only what you find works in your case and whatever that is might be totally wrong for somebody else.

Keep browsing these forums for resources and feel free to ask questions. Information can be difficult to come by, but here it is plentiful. And if you can write a complete book, then give yourself a round of congratulations no matter how good or bad you think it is. Because that IS a big deal and is not something that just anybody can do.

Best of luck!"

GeeJo,europe,1388985924.0,"* [Trollhunter](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740707/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), a ""found footage""-style monster flick, with a documentary film crew stumbling across one of the last government-sponsored troll-hunters in rural Norway. Sort of like Cloverfield, only without quite as much nausea-inducing shaky-cam (still a little, but not as much).

* [The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc-Sec](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179025/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) is something of a French version of Lemony Snicket. Typically Luc Besson.

* [Beautiful Lies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1529569/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) A hairdresser re-mails an anonymous love letter sent to her to her mother in the hopes of perking her up. It works a little too well - she wants more of them. Funny and endearing.

* [Monsters](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1470827/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) An interesting, slightly eerie film. What happens when you just give up fighting the alien monsters and just wall them off where they won't bother you any more? Don't go in thinking it's Pacific Rim, that's not the point of it.

* [The Intouchables](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/?ref_=nv_sr_1). If you haven't seen this, go out and get it *right now*. There's a reason that it's the second-best-selling French language film of all time.

* [[Rec]](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1038988/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3), another ""found footage"" film, this time a straight horror. One of the better zombie movies I've seen recently. If you've seen the American remake, you don't really need to see this - it's quite similar (though the original is a bit more *raw*).

* [Rust and Bone](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2053425/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) is a slow-burning drama / slice of life film. It's not going to get you majorly excited or worked up, but it's a solid all-round film.

If you're looking for series, [Attack on Titan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) is probably one of the most Western-accessible anime series of the past few years. Drawing heavily on the traditions of war movies and horror tropes for the plotline, it has some gorgeous animation going on and a fantastic soundtrack.

it's high school. Things are going to change a lot, by senior year I doubt you will remember why you were even friends with her. Honestly, back off her and let her grow. Don't tell her who to hang out with/what to do, always be accepting of everyone even if they make choices you wouldn't."

(Probably best not to tell her that last bit, it was just for the sake of the argument.)

Jealousy is a natural feeling but from your post, I think it's unjustified here. You are not that person anymore and if you break up the next girl won't be getting free meals, flowers and whatever it is you don't do anymore. On the other hand, if you really like her, maybe you can take into account that some of that stuff would make her happy so you could try to compromise a bit?

ernestborgnine2013,BodyAcceptance,1388985985.0,"I was in Spain years ago and I saw a young, chubby Spanish woman with stretch marks in the same places as me (which is pretty much everything from my waist to my mid thigh).  I remember thinking how beautiful and original this girl was. She was laying mostly naked on the beach, as Europeans often do. A few minutes later I saw a crowd of North Americans. The girls were wearing full bikinis and had pasty, boyish bodies. It wasn't their body shape that made them awkward, but their obvious discomfort in a crowd of half naked Spaniards. Anyway, that girl with stretch marks made me feel so much better. She rolled around on her blanket looking very comfortable being virtually naked in public.

Before that though, I remember seeing an arty fashion magazine in the 90s where a few models were shown in swimsuits. They looked great and on closer inspection, I could make out stretch marks on the one model's hips and upper legs (which is where I got them deep and big in my teens). I thought it made her look more real, and quite exotic. 

For me, it really helped seeing these examples of other women with stretch marks. 

I don't love my tiger stripes, but I don't see them as flaws any more than how I would see a large birthmark. They are like natural tattoos. "

As for criminals profiting, the free market could completely run them out of business without taxation or the criminal organizations would simply become legal entities just like the mafia did post prohibition when they moved to labor unions where they remain to this day."

flyingcatpotato,AskWomen,1388986094.0,"Having been cheated on by a guy who told all his side pieces we were over or i was frigid or we had an open marriage, i just don't sleep with married men because most of what they tell women to get them into bed is lies.  I would never take a guy's word for it that his marriage is open or poly. My best friend is in a relationship with a guy in an open marriage, but this guy has a long history which is publicly available, so we know he isn't lying to anyone.

I would potentially, if i were single, sleep with a guy in a confirmed poly or open relationship if it were completely on-board, i could talk to the wife, and no drama.  However, given my history, i'm not in the emotional place right now to be ok with a poly or open relationship. 

For those of you who say, ""it isn't my marriage, they need to work out their issues themselves"" i have to say that i was completely in the dark about my husband's affairs and finding out almost killed me. It takes two to tango but i would have appreciated that the women sleeping with him have the common decency to dump him when they found out that our marriage was neither open nor poly. They didn't, they continued to sleep with him. I think it is selfish to continue a relationship where you know someone else is getting hurt just for you to get off, which is why i was just as mad at his mistresses as i was at him.  It is really uncool to continue something like that just to get laid or because you think it is love or something. 

The only one who wins in a cheating situation is the cheater who gets laid all the time.  The spouse and the lover just get crumbs of love depending on who he feels like being with that day.

SpagNMeatball,BBQ,1388986133.0,"I have a bias because I am a Big Green Egg owner. Once you get one, you will never grill or smoke on anything else.

1. That depends on the grill/smoker and your setup. With the Egg, its not about how much charcoal you have but the airflow across it. I can create the same temp with a small pile or a large one, it will just last longer with more. Most regular charcoal grills are not sealed as well so airflow is harder to control and therefore the temp. I can fill the firebox on my egg, set the vents and let it go for 18 hours without looking at it. Webers and others need charcoal added regularly. 

2. I have not used an electric so I can't comment. In an Egg (or any kamodo) you should be able to set it and forget it. While I'm sure the electrics make good food, you are not a man if you don't cook with fire. 

3. Depends on the smoker. My Egg can go 18+ hours at 250 without touching it. I have heard that some of the webers and other metal smokers need charcoal added during a cook. 


4. Sure, if you can manage the temp and keep the heat indirect. Add a little smoker box and you should be able to get good results. I think the natural charcoal (never briquettes) adds some flavor, but you can get 95% there with a gas grill.  

If you are thinking about a Kamodo style, go look at the [Big Green Egg](http://www.biggreenegg.com), they are top of the line, have a quality product and a huge following. The Primos are very good as well.

Radius is the distance between the two center of masses

edit: This is assuming that OP is asking if the mass is doubled, the above is incorrect if OP means actual radius of the moon, the resulting mass would be far more than double the original mass"

I also struggled with this since I spent most of my life not liking vegetables, and frankly, I'm still not a fan of many raw vegetables. 

Here's my trick. I chop up vegetables quite small (got a food processor recently which makes it easier). And I put them in whatever I am cooking. Sausage, chicken, beef, i throw some vegetables into the pan along with it. (my go to's are spinach and mushrooms, although I eat alot of avocado too, but that's harder to cook in because its mushy. 

The good part about vegetables is they absorb alot of the flavor it you cook it with the meat, particularly if you cook it right when the meat starts to cook, as it will cook in the fat of the meat. It gets to the point where you barely even taste the vegetables.

Also, cauliflower rice really absorbs other flavors well too.

Hope this helps, and Keto on!"

They'll accept it as a personal quirk.

From a pragmatic point of view, if you're that high-functioning, I think people will be more accepting of your behavior if you don't attribute it to Asperger's.  It's one of those situations where for some people, any explanation amounts to an excuse.  If you offer Asperger's as a reason, they will hear Asperger's as an excuse.

GeoffreyArnold,short,1388986754.0,"&gt;Do you think short people are more inclined to develop empathy or social awareness, maybe as a response to a world that doesn't treat them as fairly? I don't, but maybe at least part of what you observed could indicate that and I think it might be a line of thought worth pursuing if only to rule it out.

No. I think short men are socialized into less competitive venues because experience has taught them that their efforts are less likely to be recognized. Likewise, I don't think the pretty girls are more empathetic than homely girls. I think that the pretty girls are free to help others because they know (on some level) that they are unlikely to ever **need** to work. (Don't kill the messenger). "

screech_owl_kachina,truegaming,1388986960.0,"To command the price some of these EA firms are asking for they really need to offer a mostly feature complete product from the jump otherwise I'm not buying. Kerbal Space Program and Dwarf Fortress (which is free) are the only two alpha/betagames I know of that I would be happy with as they stand. That's really what I'm buying from them, anything more is done merely on their honor.


If they have a slapped together alpha or nothing at all, the price needs to be way lower because of the risk involved. This is why bonds from Greece for example command higher interest rates, there's a chance you'll never see your money again. We could have tiered buy-ins like KSP or Minecraft did where people pay more as the game matures. We could even have a gate system where you only buy in to the alpha and then upgrade to beta and final to secure against risk.


Tl;dr

* Have a game that stands on its own and charge a fair price for that, or 

* Have a much lower price to account for the risk you may be unable or unwilling to continue making the game."

blergyblergy,ILiveIn,1388986962.0,"I live north of the Loop, in the main shopping/entertainment area. It's fun because there's never really a shortage of things to do. Many of the top restaurants, bars, and even clubs (slight shudder) are in this part of the city, and this is also right near where the El lines connect (hence the term of ""the loop""). Many hotels you'd find are in this area as well. So is Michigan Avenue, the primary shopping area, though it's made for tourists and is worlds away from - and more expensive than - local boutiques and all that jazz.

A few important questions - with whom are you traveling? Where are you originally from/have you been here before? How much time do you have? What are your hobbies/interests and favorite types of food?

This is gonna be a bit general, but I wanted to get some stuff out there...:)
What sorts of things do you like to do? Museum visits? If so, go to the Museum of Science and Industry (taxi, car, or bus) in Hyde Park, and while you're there, check out/pay extra for the tour of the captured German U-boat from WWII. It's incredible. Also, while in Hyde Park, check out the gorgeous University of Chicago campus - its ivy-lined quads and brutalist buildings make quite a contrasting pair. The Field Museum is pretty cool, and it's on the same beautiful manmade peninsula as the huge Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium. Do NOT miss the views you get from here of the entire city! Still fills me with childlike wonder every time...sniffle...

Chicago has a storied past as the central hub for meatpacking in the US. You are spoiled for choice when it comes to steakhouses. Your wallet won't be thrilled, but one of these does the trick - you definitely don't have to make fancy steakhouses an everyday occurrence during this trip. Gibson's/Hugo's and Morton's are tops when it comes to old-school, and Joe's is similar in the classy supper club aspect. Newer-school steakhouses are just as incredible here, and the most common choices (I think) are Chicago Cut, Mastro's, Benny's, etc. Chicago Magazine did a feature on the best steakhouses recently, and I don't agree with all of their rankings, but, hey, they know the game better than I do. 

I have always loved improv. Chicago has been a launching pad for many famous comedians, such as Tina Fey, Chris Farley, Amy Poehler, Mike Myers, and pretty much anyone who's hilarious (not kidding). Second City is the main draw because it's the most famous - and for good reason! Remember that many of their shows are scripted and not improv, but there is some good sketch comedy to be had. Improv Olympic, aka iO, is a quick hop off the red line and located in fun-if-fratty Wrigleyville. iO is massively underrated and cheaper than Second City (I have never paid over $20, and rarely $15). I have had difficulty breathing from the hilarity of their shows, which feature long form improv, some short form improv, and amazing specialized shows like the Improvised Shakespeare Company. Comedy Sportz is ""clean,"" but I've always laughed there, dick jokes or no dick jokes. I have a soft spot for Comedy Sportz because I took short form improv classes there in high school and they are awesome teachers and hilarious.

You'll be here in April which is great timing, because there might be some chill, but spring will be starting to bloom and such. Who doesn't like a beautiful lakefront in the spring? (Crazy people, that's who.)

I'd say that Chicago is a very friendly city as well - if you need directions, you won't find much difficulty getting your questions answered. Chicago is a bit ignored when it comes to ~*~World class cities~*~, but IMHO it combines the best of Midwestern hospitality and charm with actual cosmopolitan city life and an overabundance of things to do, see, eat, and drink. :)

My goal was to turn her on just enough to make her think about sex, then back off. After a couple weeks of this she was receptive when I initiated and so far things are better.

They can, technically, and there's not much you can really do about it. If they only exist in your mind that doesn't mean much. As Billy Bob Thorton once said in Bad Santa, ""wish in one hand, **** in the other, see what fills up first."" 

&gt; but the only thing you have in this world is your body and spirit.

Define ""spirit""...I don't believe in the supernatural btw...which might be a major reason i have an issue with the concept of rights...they seem to be an extension of divine command theory.

&gt; you are exercising your individual rights by staying alive and free from harm, nobody can ""guarantee"" that you remain alive because that's impossible, but they can infringe on your ability to stay alive and seek freedom.

This is where things get murky...what EXACTLY do you mean by rights? Define a ""right"". And explain why they're so important in your own words. Because it's quite clear my concept of rights IS a lot different than yours, since it DOES require on social recognition."

If it is one on one, I have to be able to prove my life was in danger, otherwise it is murder. If I shoot someone in the back, it is murder, regardless if they're armed or not. 

I don't have a license to be a cop. I have a license to defend myself and my own. Anything else is not permitted. I highly doubt your state is any different. "

The fact is that you have a problem because she feels like she is missing out on things and not being treated as well as your ex. So that leaves you with 3 options (that I can think of):

1- Breakup 

2- Compromise

3 -Stick to your guns while trying to make her understand that you're the same person she fell in love with in the first place. This one failing, choose between 1 and 2.

Good luck"

I challenged her to a few rounds of Mario Kart 64, after which she said ""why are we playing this? The graphics are shitty, the controls feel terrible and everything is just so much more polished on the Wii version."" (she said pretty much exactly that but with more words). I explained to her that the only reason we have MKWii or Super Mario galaxy or LOZ: Twilight Princess is because games like MK64, SM64 and OOT broke new ground and set the precedent for excellent successors to the same or similar formulae. Some games, like the first Legend of Zelda or Metroid games on NES, (I grew up on Nintendo, okay?) aren't really ""good""* by today's standards anymore. People still play them, though, because they're significant to the development of their genres. So yes, I think it is possible to be well-gamed.

Yes, everyone is human and makes judgements, you're right about that.

Live and let live, I think. If he's telling white jokes, he sure as hell can't get mad at a Muslim joke. If a homophobe is trying to block gay rights because of his beliefs, he sure as hell can't get pissed at a gay guy fighting for his own.



But, just because he's dark skinned and have a microphone doesn't give him the right to spout lies. Just irks me to no end.

It was introduced back in the 50s as a sugar substitute. When it was introduced, people flipped their lid because it was an artificial sweetener and would give you cancer. So the FDA did tests. Nothing.

But people weren't convinced. Someone would make a fuss, people would freak out, and more tests would be done. 1960s - shit flipped, more tests, nothing. 1970s, shit flipped, still nothing. 1980s, 90s, 2000s - nothing. In 50 years of testing, there hasn't been a scrap of data that links aspartame to health risks in anything but a coincidence of lifestyle (folks drinking 20 diet sodas a day don't generally don't make the best health decisions overall).

Aspartame, as a food additive, is one of the most heavily researched and scrutinized chemicals currently in use, and despite all of the scares and tests and studies there's no evidence of it being dangerous. And that's looking beyond the fact that, from a chemical perspective, it *physically has no interaction* with the body once it's past your tongue - it breaks down into a nonreactive compound that's flushed out a few hours later in your piss.

That's exactly the point.  ""Taxpayers"" are not a monolithic anonymous group, and some members of the public find funding abortion to be a repugnant use of their contributions.  In the US it's not a small group of people who feel that way.  It's why we've had a moratorium on public funding for abortions in the US for ages.  It's essentially forcing people to be party to a system that violates their religious principles.

Sparkade,stunfisk,1388987530.0,"Tentacruel is one of my favorites. I run two.  
  
* Calm
* 252HP/252SpDef/6Speed
* Black Sludge  
* Substitute
* Ice Beam
* Scald
* SludgeBomb/Venoshock (Depending on whether or not I have Toxic Spikes up, usually not.)  
  
This is a special tank made to handle physical attackers with a burn, take down ground types, and whittle away at fairy tanks.  It's not that great because it's the moveset I made while playing the game (My Tentacruel was the first level 100 Pokemon in my Y version)  
  
* Timid
* 252SpAtk/252Speed/6HP
* Black Sludge
* Scald
* Ice Beam
* Sludge Bomb (Used to be Toxic Spikes)
* Dazzling Gleam (Used to be Hex/Venoshock)  
  
This is a good all-around offensive threat with some special tanking capabilities. Throw on a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs and you have yourself a pretty serious revenge killer.  
  
Now, for Ferrothorn, I have a couple sets I use in BW but I haven't really used anything serious in XY. 

* Sassy Nature
* 252Def/252SpDef
* Leftovers
* Curse
* Substitute
* Leech Seed
* Shadow Claw/PayBack  
  
I used to run 252HP/252SpDef on lolumadbro, my first Ferrothorn, but honestly setting up with Curse isn't that great without Defense, and Leech Seed really doesn't do as much if your health is optimal. "

JonWood007,buildapc,1388987565.0,"Well the point of a lot of those builds is to show you can build a PC equal to a console at the price. Although I do agree they cut corners and are dishonest. Like those Athlon IIs they use? Basically similar to phenom IIs, and lemme tell you, phenom IIs are not the best at running next gen games. COnsoles probably do offer slightly better performance, and it's likely gonna go downhill from here. I know, I know, a lot of this is because the devs working on next gen games are very lazy in making the PC ports, but still, when your CPU runs the game at 45 FPS and the console does it at 60, then the PC is weaker even if the hardware is technically superior. I always was annoyed by people leaving out windows. 

KB/M is a bit less important to include though. You can just use what you have now. Won't be the best and you might wanna eventually upgrade, but it's not that important. A $10 e-3lue cobra will have you set as far as mice go and any old keyboard will do."

calexanderj,AskMen,1388987640.0,"&gt; I want you to explain ""false advertising"" and whether it is upsetting because the girl is actually ugly or she is insecure.

False advertising is making a guy expect one thing and then delivering another. Some guys prefer big boobs, some guys prefer small boobs, some guys have no preference.  It's probably fair to say that if a guy expresses disappointment when he learns you are wearing a padded bra, he probably prefers bigger boobs.  But that doesn't mean he doesn't find you attractive overall or that most guys wouldn't find your boobs attractive.

I think more guys would be less disappointed by big boobs in a minimizer than small boobs that were padded, but again it depends. There are a lot of factors that go into the attractiveness of boobs, but for the most part it's usually just nice to see a pair."

But out loud I said ""I wonder how that works"" With some hand movements and everyone thought I questioning the physics of the interactions.... Yeah no amount of digging got me out of that one.

But to the original question, how does it work, are there guys who prefer certain statue, do you prefer tall guys?

screenmagnet,sex,1388987852.0,"I get what you are saying and there are no easy answers to make you feel better. It really sucks to be in your position. The reality is that most people don't want to get involved with someone who has a chronic illness or disability. Most people with limitations such as yours find partners by slowly getting to know someone first as a friend, rather than through hooking up at a club. Or they meet other people with illnesses or disabilities through support groups or specialized online dating sites. I know it's not fair, but that's the reality.

If your sex drive is really bothering you, you could consider suppressing it with medication. I know that's not an ideal option, but it may help you keep your sanity until you meet someone who is interested in you.

I am in the medical field and I have seen people struggle with the feelings that you are struggling with. My heart goes out to you. It really sucks. I'm sorry that you were dealt such a shitty hand in life."

rawkstarr,AskReddit,1388987876.0,"In grade 12 I was a HUGE procrastinator, I barely did any big assignments, and handed in stuff late all the time. Sometimes I don't even know how I passed. Anyways, I started college this year, in a program that I'm still not sure if I really like, and realized that my parents are paying for this and I'm not going to put it to waste.

I found a friend to be partners with on every assignment and we got shit done waaay in advance. I ended up getting honour roll with a 90% average in my first semester. And seeing those high marks throughout the semester really motivated me. 

I decided my programs by how much they interested me and also about how many jobs are available for those fields. I want to be happy with my future career, but I also want to get a job quickly after I graduate college. But as I said above, I'm still not sure about this program.

All I can say is look at pretty much everything each college has to offer, and choose the ones that are most interesting to you. Also try www.careercruising.com and do the quizzes they have on there and research some careers that seem interesting to you. Good luck! :)"

Sexual education at school is mandatory (unless its a faith school) consultation with a doctor or sexual heath nurse is free, you don't even need ID, nobody has to know you are seeing a doctor, nobody has to know you are having sex.

Here's the thing about these builds. While they are roughly the same as console hardware, and while they do produce graphics as good as PS4, for instance (roughly), the CPU is a bottleneck, and will result in a slightly lower/less consistent framerate than consoles offer. Try playing BF4, or planetside 2, or COD Ghosts on that. You're not gonna get a constant 60 FPS on that (maybe on ghosts with enough tweaking). Probably closer to 45-50 average.

After the first year or two, i wouldnt have confidence that such a build will continue to adequately play games. It does the job now, but the CPU in particular is, like, just enough power to run games decently any more."

* [Attack on Titan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin) (well animated and quite serious/dark)
* [Eden of the East](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5630/Higashi_no_Eden) (has a good blend of action, mystery, comedy, and sci-fi
* [Claymore](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1818/Claymore) (another darker series, rather violent and bloody if you're ok with it)
* [Cowboy Bebop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1/Cowboy_Bebop) (considered a classic and many people's first introduction to anime directed at adult audiences)
* [Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass) (if you've ever seen the film Minority Report, this is conceptually similar)
* [Bleach](http://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach) (people might shoot me down for this, but honestly, I genuinely believe it has a good story until the end of the Soul Society Arc, around episode 62 or 63; it goes downhill after that, though, and falls prey to stupid and repetitive plots)"

I think ""on"" is more natural for physical places and things. You're on an island, you're on a bridge, but you're in a neighborhood. 


edit: rough google test: 

* ""on the upper west side"": About 20,900,000 results (1.03 seconds)

* ""in the upper west side"": About 22,000,000 results (0.47 seconds) 

* ""on the upper east side"": About 20,900,000 results (1.03 seconds)

* ""in the upper east side"": About 23,400,000 results (1.04 seconds) 


Close to a tie, but 'in' beats 'on'. Keeping in mind that the number of google search results is just an approximation, the order of magnitude tells you something and that's there is no clear winner. 


edit2: change it to ""I'm in the upper east side"" vs ""I'm on the upper east side"" and the results are orders of magnitude better for ""in"". I think you're totally wrong. "

There are MANY terms in betting but some are

* odds = the chance that what you pick will happen. it is usually written like  this 10/1 or 100/1 or 15/2. Odds will ALWAYS be in whole numbers and rounded down to the lowest whole fraction. the higher the fraction, the less chance that the person offering the odds believes it will happen. eg evens (1/1) will probably happen and if as likely as a heads in a coin toss. 100/1 will only happen once in every 100 tries.

* evens = a 1 to 1 odds on a bet. eg red or black, odd or even, high or low etc

* to place = a bet made ""to place"" is like saying you think your horse will come in 1st 2nd OR 3rd. If you bet this way you obviously get lower odds. If the odds are 10/1 for a win then you'll probably get 9/1 if it places 1st, 5/1 fir 2nd and 1/1 fro third

* push =  to leave your winnings in for another round of bets

* parlay =  the language of the bookies. they have a sign language combined with simple words to convey odds to each other. only HARDENED gamblers learn this and I see no reason too.

if you have any specific things you'd like defining then feel free to ask away."

I'm only playing devil's advocate here, but copyright infringement laws and censorship are two things which are fairly unrelated.

viewless25,NYYankees,1388988217.0,"I like this discussion, but there are a lot of mislead points. That rotation isn't hopeless at the end. Its essentially two prospects on any other team competing for the 5th spot if Tanaka goes to the Yankees. Which is exactly what Phelps and Pineda need to progress (as far as I see it). If you have concerns in the bullpen, let the loser of the competition at the fifth spot go to the bullpen and work and be a day to day relief pitcher. I believe A-rod misses most of this season, which opens the door to Tanaka, but creates issues at 3rd. Throw Kelly Johnson at third, Roberts at second and call it a day there.  They might get criticized for some of this, but they need to tune out the noise.

There was a good point (mislead as it may be) about attendance at Yankee Stadium. Although I didn't like the comment about Yankee fans being ""Victory Crackheads"". Its not that the fans don't love the team even as it falls short of the playoffs, its that the games aren't worth what the organization is making it cost. Its true that attendance plummeted this season and although its related to the mediocre performance, that isn't the cause.  Yankee stadium is a pain in the ass. Its in the Bronx, costs a limb, has overpriced food and merchandise, and is a generally inconvenient stadium. If they fix some of these issues, (mainly the pricing) they can definitely get fans in those seats. We understand that what Girardi did with this roster this season was amazing and would have been Manager of the Year caliber if they had made the playoffs. We understand that winning more than 1/4 of World Series that happened throughout this team's existence is unheard of. I know they'd get We'd still love our Yankees if they did undergo rebuilding. We *do* love our Yankees. But the process of seeing them in Yankee Stadium is too much for a barely .500 team. So either win World Series, lower the prices, or accept embarrassingly poor attendance.  Notice how you still see the Yankee fans at Angels games, Mariners games, Royals games, and Marlins games. Its not the fans not being loyal. Its the convenience factor of going to the game.  If the lower their prices Yankees acquire Tanaka, let either Phelps or Pineda move to the pen, and rebuild their infield without a-rod, they'll really have something.

tangerinelion,intj,1388988232.0,"Look, this kind of fluffy MBTI stuff is more similar to a horoscope anyway.  What matters are your functions - are you Ni-Te-Fi-Se or Ti-Ne-Si-Fe?  INTJ and INTP simply are labels to describe those function sets.

What gets me is when people think that because you are some type X you can never show a behavior counter to your type.  Or in functional terms, if you're Ni-Te you will never let Fi show through your Te.  Or, even better, if you're Ni-Te you will never do something that comes from Fe, Ti, or Ne.  Everyone has all 8 functions, they are simply in a *preferred* order that differs with each type.  INTJ prefer Ni over Te, but we use a fucking lot of Te, don't we?  We prefer Te over Fi, but it's Fi that gives us a set of morals.

My point is you're overthinking the questions.  ""I feel comfortable around people.""  You hypothesize a situation involving a cute barista to show that you're not opposed to smalltalk but then say you default to hesitation.  The question WANTS you to answer what your default, preferred response is.

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1388988324.0,"&gt;I think these guys have only the most attractive women in mind when they think of ""women.""

Nope. Any woman always has a significant advantage over an equally attractive man.

&gt;Hardly any women would be single or going through dry spells if they had hordes of men approaching them constantly.

Several reasons for this...

1) women have low testosterone (obviously) which is a large contributing factor in risk aversion (aka, women won't approach men)

2) women squander their privilege because they are unaware of how  rigged the game is in their favour. 

3) women's sexual role is to pick from the roster of men they collect at any given time. Many women have high standards in relation to their SMV, and therefore, hold on for extended periods of time until a man meets that standard.

&gt; Some of my friends and I never get flirted with or asked out and none of us are straight-up ugly.

fffangold,Morrowind,1388988453.0,"Personally, I think Skyrim is the pinnacle of the series, because it took what was great about Morrowind and Oblivion and blended it together into an incredible game.

Morrowind had a great story, casting you as a hero (though you had to earn it), and the quest put you into contact with a variety of different cultures. In fact, I will say that this variety of cultures is where Morrowind shines the most.

On the other hand, Morrowind has the worst navigation of the series. It's true it's more immersive when you are given real directions that direct you around landmarks and signs to point out the correct path, but this immersion comes at too high a cost in getting on with the questing for me. I actually never finished Morrowind until I got a mod that let me teleport to major plot points, approximating the fast travel added to later games in the series.

Oblivion, on the other hand, had great navigation, fast travel, and let you easily get wherever you need to go. Questing was a breeze, and it's easy to get into.

But Oblivion is just so bland. The Oblivion gates all feel the same, and there's very little variation of culture between the different cities of Cyrodil. This may make sense from a standpoint of lore, but it's kinda boring in that regard.

[On top of that, you aren't even the real hero. I mean, you do most of the work, but in the end, it's all about Martin Septim, who actually saves the empire, even if it was you who made it possible. I found this utterly unsatisfying, and wanted to actually fight the demon at the end of the game.](/spoiler)

Skyrim has more culture variation than Oblivion, though not as much as Morrowind admittedly. Skyrim has an epic story that actually casts you as the hero, Dragonborn, and your role is central to the story, unlike Oblivion. Skyrim also directs you easily from quest to quest, has a fast travel system to make Oblivion proud, and though it's a bit on the snowy side for my tastes, still has a reasonable variation of environments.

Being a newer game, it also has shinier graphics (minor in the grand scheme of things, but still a plus unless they make your computer cry). The far simpler system of leveling is also something I see as a plus, as it does away with concepts like ""efficient leveling"" and indeed, lets you just play the game and handles leveling up based entirely on how you play, so you don't have to agonize about the best way to build your character.

CR00KS,MMFB,1388988459.0,"&gt; But everyone knows that a business degree is useless unless it's a graduate degree.

As a business student myself (CIS) that has internship experience, I don't think I can agree with this. There are plenty of people with only business undergrad degrees working their 9-5 salary job. I've got a whole mix of advice for you so I'll just put it in a fancy bullet format so I don't bombard you with paragraphs.

* I'm not sure what business school you go to, but speak to a career center or your advisor for some assistance. They not only help reduce any stress but also provide you with some good career resources and even job openings. 

* Have you applied to any jobs yet? You are about to graduate with a degree that requires specific skills and is in demand. An internship is nice but it's never 100% necessary. There are dozens of ways you can relate your current waitress job to a bank or financial firm (I'm in the food service field myself). Are you accurate? Are you quick? Do you collaborate well in a team environment? Can you communicate efficiently between your coworkers? Can you use Excel beyond a basic knowledge? All of these skills are great in any office environment and will look good if you put them on your resume.

* Although you had a lack of internships, is there anything else you can make it up with? School projects? A high GPA? Dean's list? A special scholarship? A combination of these can be great replacements for an internship. 

* Connect and network with colleagues and friends on Linkedin.

* Again have you actually started the process of applying for jobs? A lot of places are hire in the fall for spring graduates. You may have missed the deadline for the big names like E&amp;Y, Deloitte, etc, but you can't be too picky for your first full time job if you don't have an amazing background. Apply everywhere!

* Use /r/resumes or /r/resume for resume assistance or feel free to send it my way. 

I hope I didn't stress you out more than made you feel better. Above all else though, know that a finance degree is no walk in the park and you should feel proud of your self. Your degree is useful for companies and is in demand, you just gotta show them that you can provide the necessary skills.

They will most likely make fun of you more than good and normal friends because they know that your relationship is stronger.

There are also things the federal government does an absolute shit job at and recognizing the difference between the two doesn't mean that the federal government needs to stop doing the few things it does well.  It just means that we need to find other alternatives to federal intervention in the cases where it doesn't do an acceptable job.

BuildMyPaperHeart,Warframe,1388988585.0,"&gt; Where's the best place to farm fusion cores?

Survivals and Wave/Mobile Defenses are pretty good places to nab a bunch of cores.

&gt; Also, how can I read/learn more about Warframe's lore? I'm usually not too huge on the lore of a game, but I'm super fascinated in it. I've read everything the wiki has. 

There isn't much else confirmed outside of what the Codex entries say or what's on the Wiki. Everything else is speculation. As for Dark Sector's relation to Warframe, here's the story as paraphrased from DE in their Livestreams:

Dark Sector was originally WARFRAME in development, but had to be changed up quite a bit to meet publisher standards. As a result, their vision for the game was skewed and they ended up releasing a mediocre-reviewed third-person shooter in the vein of Resident Evil 4. 

With the emergence of the Free-to-Play model, and an invigorated team, they decided to try again and carry out their original vision. Since some of the ideas for Warframe they used in Dark Sector, they made a few links to their previous title as tribute, and potentially something more!

Specifically, DE has stated that Warframe takes place ""thousands of years"" into the future of Dark Sector. While elements exist that may be results of the ending of Dark Sector, such as Hayden Tenno's enduring legacy in the Tenno, and the Technocyte virus, there are currently no *direct linkages* between the characters or events depicted in Dark Sector in Warframe at this time. Future implementation of lore is still incoming."

Prairie_Pete,Anarchism,1388988694.0,"No it most certainly does not. That being said, it supports the possibility that these may be true. I'm not trying to pass off spiritual beliefs as science, but what I'm saying is that as science improves, we're discovering there's a lot of things that can't solely be explained by our materialist worldview. Quantum entanglement opens the door for things to be connected on a level far greater than we understand. Same with the work done at the Heart Math Institute. And personality =/= consciousness by any means. I'm not trying to claim mystical or spiritual beliefs as scientifically valid, but the direction science is heading seems to support them, if at least not rule them out. 

Now if I may offer a counterpoint to your second point. Anarchism's biggest strength, I believe, is its diversity. Diversity of viewpoints, of ways of relating to one another and of ways of relating to our universe is crucially important. The whole point is to bring out opposing views. Maybe pixie home worries are silly, and if they are then the community will decide as much. But personally I think having a group of people who believe the Earth is one being would be a really good addition to any community. Not harming the Earth is a pretty sound viewpoint any way you cut it. It is by hearing different viewpoints and evaluating them that the community will reach the best conclusions. "

Gamernamerjj,MorbidReality,1388988818.0,"Living in a household where a lot of yelling goes down (my father has anger problems and my little brother has Asperger's), I can tell you how poisonous of a situation these can be. Sure, my situation is not nearly as bad, but I feel myself blocking out the rest of my family when that's going on and isolating myself from them. I have a little brother who is 6. He gets scared and cries sometimes when the fighting is going on. It's not a healthy situation to be in. And, if you accidentally start the fight... The guilt is immense. Like I said, my situation pales into comparison to this. There are occasional swears thrown around, but little to no insults and blaming, etc. It's not that my brother needs to be taken away, because it's not so serious. But in this situation... It can be so scaring to be the bystander. It's scary. You learn to block things out. ... This may lead to bottling up emotions, which, as evidenced by this video, is not good. It leads to some major damage down the road. Plus, at her age, she probably doesn't fully understand. 

In a house so full of anger and with parents that can't control themselves... She may very well have been the new target with Evan gone.

Then you've got the standard Search and Destroy, Last Man Standing, Capture the Flag, Free for All. 

Best of all, it's free! But it is pay to win, and the servers are plauged by those pay to win types, and hackers are a common problem, but it's easy to get rid of them. Or rather there's not much protection against hacking in the first place, but it's easy to ban a hacker from your game by vote. 

Great game, lots of potential, but a terrible business model and annoying community. So, weigh the pros and cons.


2: Obligatory TF2 plug. You wont find a more teamwork oriented FPS. Also free. Very polished, great community, no pay to win, only pay to look snazzy. It's got a different art style than most shooters, and that really turns some people off, but it is a genuinely great game. I whole heartedly recommend it. 

3: Arma is so team based it's annoying. They remove the power of the player and make it the power of the team. You're a pro at shooters? Gonna go in the enemy base guns blazing? You might get one or two enemies, but three noobs will take you down. (I haven't played Arma III yet, but if it's anything like the second one...)"

citadel_lewis,DebateReligion,1388988995.0,"&gt;If you believe something without good evidence, or more importantly with evidence that contradicts it, THAT should be called faith. It's a meaningful distinction instead of applying it to everyone.

Okay, but you have to admit that even with this distinction there are examples of theists and atheists whose beliefs are guided by faith. 

&gt;I don't have problems with people claiming to ""know"" mutually exclusive things, because it's less absurd than saying we can never know anything.

That is a false dichotomy - I wasn't saying that people can either know mutually exclusive things or they can not know anything. 

&gt;Clearly we CAN know things if there are justified true beliefs, we just don't know who is correct. 

But that is not knowledge. Maybe I'm being philosophically pedantic, but I believe we must be.

&gt;The justification is thus the bit that is something we can actually analyze and when someone says ""I know"", then ""how they know"" is what we can discuss meaningfully. 

That's fine, and is how someone who believes in God can show that their belief is not based on faith, but reason. It's the same with atheists, in my opinion, but they desperately deny it because of the negative associations they have applied to it.

TwirlySocrates,changemyview,1388989207.0,"We're a product of nature blah blah, we're related to apes, Biologists say so, etc etc. I agree. That's out of the way. Good.

But! Humans are very different to animals, and it isn't just because of the scale of what we do.

* When a biochemist is discussing the process of DNA transcription and protein translation, will they do so in the language of quantum field theory? DNA transcription is just the interaction of lots of fundamental particles, right?

* When an ecologist is discussing the population dynamics of cheetahs and antelopes, will they do so in the language of biochemistry? Cheetahs and antelopes are just the product of biochemistry, right?

* Likewise, when a developmental psychologist is discussing the needs of a kindergarten student, will they do so in the language of human physiology? If you have lots of meat and lots of bones, you get a child, right?

Even though you technically can say ""yes"" to any of those questions, the answer is usually ""no"". My point in asking the above questions is that when you scale up a system (say, the difference between one hydrogen atom and an ocean of water), you start dealing with completely new phenomena which can't be adequately described in terms of its elementary processes.

Oceanographers generally don't worry about the fact that oceans contain zillions of hydrogen atoms. No, they're worrying about estuarine flow patterns, benthic denitrification, and the Coriolis effect. These are properties of the system which only become apparent at large scales, and require a completely new language for us to discuss and understand.

A human brain isn't just a scaled up squirrel brain. It's wiring is vastly more complex, and our behaviors are like nothing else of earth. Squirrels don't impeach their political leaders on the grounds of moral misconduct. Squirrels don't worry about the distinction between 3/4 time and 6/8 time in musical notation. Squirrels don't build satellites, or hold a conference call between 4 continents. Human behavior has created entirely new systems which can only be properly understood when your descriptive vocabulary of humanity expands to include words outside the realm of zoology.

**tldr: Scale doesn't account for all the differences between stick-wielding apes, and internet-trolling humans.**

You want something coarse, still, going finer is really only going to speed up the process and increases the chance of your filter clogging.  Speeding it up is essentially what you want, though, since you're telling us that in the time it takes you to brew a batch (36 hr) you've drank the last batch.  Which also tells us you use about 2/3lb coffee per day, which is about 5700mg of caffeine.  This is inhuman.

Please tell us what information you left out (like you're brewing for a family of 4), or if I simply have the wrong size for the T2 jug.

But really, do not try to concentrate the coldbrew.  This does nothing but make it taste bad - I wouldn't even microwave it.  The alternative solution is to create more space in your refrigerator and get other carafes to store your coldbrew in while you constantly remake more.

Two ways to look at this:

* The diagonal asymptote is there because as x increases, the overall expression basically becomes -x. For when x increases, the number 1 is swallowed up into relative insignificance, and the ratio of -x^(2)/x practically becomes just -x. Hence the hyperbola will descend down on the line y = -x as x increases in the positive direction - and *mutatis mutandis* will rise up under that line as x runs off in the negative direction.

* Do the polynomial long division problem (-x^(2) + 1) ÷ x and you will get a quotient -x + (1/x); since the degree of the numerator is exactly one more than that of the denominator, then the polynomial part of the quotient, here just -x, indicates that the asymptote is y = -x."

naturalveg,vegan,1388989447.0,"I'll follow the format used in the article, and raise a question related to your comment: 

Do you think anti-slavery leafleters were referred to by slavery supporters in the 17 and 1800s as ""pushy"" (or the contemporary equivalent)? If they were, does it even matter?

Here's my favorite quote of all time:

""Animal agriculture takes a small hit whenever somebody becomes vegetarian or vegan, but the loss of one customer is something the industry can live with. What the industry won't be able to endure is a steady stream of new activists seeking to put an end to animal agriculture."" - Erik Marcus, Meat Market

Animals need us to speak for them and tell the world that they are suffering. People genuinely don't know. If that gains us some negative PR, so be it. Not doing it hurts the animals more. Letting people who would definitely change their behavior if they knew what was really happening continue to be unaware hurts the animals more.

You can only know what the reception to leafleting is after you've spent a good amount of time leafleting. Most people pass you by and don't take a leaflet and have no idea what you're handing out. Many people take one and likely never read it. Many people take one and have a few glances and throw it out. Some people read it. Some people read it and absorb the message and make changes. Some people read it and go to the site on the back of the booklet and request more info. Most of the people who stop to talk to leafleters show their appreciation for what we're doing and ask questions. MANY people say that they've never heard about this issue before and they didn't know it was like this. Its very rare to get someone who is angry at us for giving out information. I would say even the most frequent leafleters can hand out thousands of leaflets without encountering even *one* of those people. The reception is heavily weighted in the positive direction.

Personally, I think the ""preachy vegan"" image comes more from the screaming protesters and paint-throwers than from leafleters. I've never heard of anyone referring to leafleting when talking about vegan preaching."

EGrshm,acappella,1388989527.0,"I've posted this comment before, so I'll just copypasta.

&gt; My A Cappella group just finished our 5th CD. It has been one of the most amazing, frustrating, and rewarding experiences of my collegiate career. Granted our CD ended up being a $12,000 project, but IMO it was worth it.
There's definitely a main points I'd like to make. Check out the internet, it was my best resource while looking for rates on recording studios and how-tis on producing an album. Be prepared! It's a huge task.

&gt;**Raising money**: This was definitely the harder thing for my group to do. Trying to get musicians to raise money was like herding cats. Musicians are generally great when it comes to music and performance, but consistently calling people, selling presales and post-production CDs was hard for them to manage. I'd recommend setting specific sales goals, timelines and deadlines, and having ""selling parties,"" where the whole group meets, hangs out, and just calls people for an entire night. The presale ""selling parties"" were what made us the most money. We made the rest from singing at paid gigs in the area. Sell presales, hype it up, tell people that you're making an album, give them a (realistic) release date (aside: this is important, it took us almost a year and a half to finish, just because of money issues) and ask them to buy a pre-ordered album for $15-$20. This will help you fundraise.

&gt;**Committing members**: Make sure everyone is committed! THIS IS ESSENTIAL. Otherwise, people will bail, or complain the whole time. It sounds like people are hesitant to begin, which is normal, but getting everyone to commit is going to smooth out the whole process. Make them aware that the project will involve actively selling presales, production (which is a blast but definitely taxing), and actively promoting the CD afterwards.

&gt;**Timing**: Get the CD done. Set deadlines and stick to them. If you don't finish the album fast enough, the music will be outdated and your members will graduate before they can promote the CD. This happened to my group.
Practicing: Without this, the album will be shit. I won't lie. Don't create a shit product, invest in it - EVEN if it's more than $3000. Otherwise no one will invest in your 2nd (and 3rd, and 4th, etc.) albums. It's worth the extra investment. And if you sell enough presales - consider them investments - you won't pay out of pocket. Trust me on this, it's worth the extra money.
Recording: Unless anyone in your group has any recording, editing, mixing, or mastering experience and is REALLY GOOD, I would recommend finding a studio to record in or hiring and recording engineer. They know infinitely more than you or I - and I know a damn lot - about A Cappella recording. Depending on your area, there are some good studios. We recorded in a group-member's bedroom, taped blankets all over the walls, and recorded in groups of 2 or individually. Our project was edited by Ben Liebermann, and mixed and mastered through Liquid 5th studios in Raleigh, NC by Carl Taylor. We printed the CDs ourselves.

&gt;PM me for more info, I might have some more sources for you. Good luck, don't be scared, and get excited! :)

&gt;EDIT 2: Here's a pretty kickass manual[1] I got from a local Recording Engineer. Check it out!

I have a friend. She attended a pricey private college and amassed $120,000 in student loan debt without finishing (she's an internship shy of completing her degree).

In bitterness (or spite) of not completing school, she has neglected to pay her loans (Federal and private). Instead, she let them lapse into the hands of the co-signer, her mother [who recently re-married ~1 yr ago]. The loans, at my last asking, have ballooned up to ~$250,000.

She was working a contract position and had saved somewhere in the ball-park of $5,000 at a bank where the holders of the loans couldn't immediately take the money out of her account. She recently told me that she's paying $500/month in loans at her mother's insistence.

**My Question:** What can she do to help herself pay back the loans? She has insisted that every avenue she has gone down, she has faced rejection upon rejection for help.

Ultimately she has claimed that she wants to file for bankruptcy to wipe out her loans so she can get an apartment (^no, ^no, ^no, ^no ^x ^infinity ^not ^with ^me ^hell ^no) and move out of her moms' place. "

Luckily, it was a phone call, not a meeting. When it happens, I am already suspicious. I can't remember how I got suspicious. Anyway, the call starts and they ask everyone to say their name and where they are calling from. I decided I wouldn't say anything, just listen. The callers one by one introduce themselves and they all sound super excited (like cult members I imagine would sound). There weren't that many of them. There seemed to be a lot of dead air between people. Eventually, there was dead air again for a long time and I realized there were on other callers. That's when I knew it was a MLM. Just from the way people introduced themselves, I got the impression that everyone on that call was already ""working"" for the company and now they were waiting for me to announce myself. I finally gave in and said my name because the silence was awkward. I sounded like I was in mourning compared to the other callers.

Which is basically what racial profiling is, giving you extra attention.  The whole point was to give an analogy not involving race to help understand *why* this would be wrong.

As for the morality issue, the view was ""there is nothing **wrong** with police racial profiling.""  Wrong implies morality, not whether the act is legal or effective.

everyonelikesnoodles,AskReddit,1388990256.0,"I actually think reddit has a strong chance at longevity. The user-generated content is so incredibly diverse and has something for everyone ('hey guys, i think my testicles are infected', cats!, ELI5 questions surrounding the nature and composition of the universe, oh, and porn.gifs for days among thousands of other subreddits). There are so many different content paths to go down with reddit and the ability to self-curate the content without automated personalization is a phenomenal feature. Finally, reddit was ahead of the curve by remaining behind the times. In the days when AOL dominated, no one actually self-identified online. Very few, if any people ever actually used their real names. Once that began, the chilling effect of how and what we say online entered into it, for better or worse. Reddit, or more accurately, redditors kept it anonymous by use of creative account names, which has a direct impact on the incredible ecosystem of content and content types that just keep coming. So, I'm actually optimistic about the longevity of reddit for those reasons. My only apprehension is a user-funded application without ads. Yes, I love it but I have to wonder how long they can exist with 'giliding' as a source of revenue. "

I identify as a bisexual woman -- I am fairly evenly attracted to both men and women, BUT... historically, I've only dated men, so people are usually surprised when I tell them I'm bisexual. It's not that I care about gender, it's just that I found male partners and not female partners at those points in my life. Maybe it's just that men openly hit on me often, and women rarely do, so I'm never sure when it's okay for me to approach another woman. 

Anyway. I definitely feel that I'm a little 'shut out' of the LGBT community. Firstly, being bisexual already puts me in an awkward spot (neither in nor out) and then on top of that, not having any HERE LOOK AT THIS proof is unacceptable for a lot of people out there. 

I know logically that if I'm bi, I'm bi. I've had sexual experiences with women and men, and I want sexual experiences with women and men, end of story. But most people just assume I'm straight, and to go around correcting everyone seems so presumptous. "

I can handle her just fine, I'm 6'7 and exercise regularly and I can still feel just how powerful she is. Their strength is amazing for their size as you already know. I think about 10 ft or 40lbs will be when I start to require multiple people with my snake. She weighs a little over 20 right now.

All of that said, there are times that I can tell she is mad/hungry when I open the cage by how ""interested"" she is in my hand (read jerky/sudden movements). She has never bit me (4 yrs so far) but I've never pushed it either. If she doesn't seem content with my hand in the cage I leave her alone and try the next day. I could probably get her out without incident but if she's uneasy I don't want to hold her and possibly put her in a situation where I have to find out just how many people it does take to control her. 

I guess I don't have a direct answer, I'm hoping you can draw one from my info and other's. I think that if you handle a snake enough (with others around) you will feel how strong they are and you can make your judgement then if you're comfortable holding it alone."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388990722.0,"And to me, this seems very shaky in general, and doesn't resonate well with me.

I know when you take God out of the equation, rights are hard to justify. And no offense, but I just don't think you've done so adequately. They exist and should be respected, but aren't always respected. It sounds like they exist, according to you, in some abstract sense, but practically speaking, they're very questionable IMO.

Let me explain to you MY way of doing things. I start not with the concept of rights, but the social contract. While yes, we start out with life, and with liberty, such a life really isn't that great. Thomas Hobbes called it ""nasty, brutish, and short"". You don't last very long on your own, and life generally isn't very pleasant. It's full of pain, and hunger, and fear, and death.

In order to increase our chances of survival and increase our qualify of life, we form communities, and these communities can become large societies. However, for the benefits that such communities bring, there are rules. You have to GIVE UP some of your LIBERTY, for a level of security, to protect and enhance your LIFE.

That being said, I think the primary function of government and morality, is to preserve life. I believe it's second goal is to use its power for good to improve our lives. How it accomplishes these things is debatable, and I don't necessarily think there is one answer. However, I think when measured against the goal, some answers can be determined better and more effective than others. 

Libertarians, in addition to life, like to go on about negative rights, and seem particularly obsessed with the idea of property. I wanna discuss this a little bit. Property is a very useful concept, and is probably necessary for societies beyond the most basic tribal units. However, taken to an extreme, do property rights used in the way libertarians use them, REALLY enhance human well being? I'd say no. If you've been looking around lately, income inequality is growing, property rights are used to justify this inequality, and provide the illusion that the rich earned their wealth, even though the societal structures indicate a rigged game. Many, many people are losing their living standards, and are doing worse. We're working longer, for less money, and it's deemed okay because applying libertarianism in a legalistic way, it's deemed that such transactions are voluntary...even though society is structured in a way to favor the very rich. So basically, we have a problem where our current approach to property HARMS the larger human well being, since only a few are prospering from it, at the expense of everyone else. That being said, I have absolutely zero problem with a certain level of wealth redistribution in the form of basic income. It retains the capitalist system that creates wealth, and protects property rights, mostly, but it evens the playing field a little bit, raising living standards where the private sector is not, and makes sure all of society benefits. Libertarianism seems to promote the idea that everyone is an island unto themselves, that when you earn the fruits of your labor, you did it all yourself, but that's not true. The largest successes are done with masses of people under you, and IMO, they're entitled to a cut. We're interdependent. And when the rich succeed, we should all succeed. Now, I don't take this to the extreme. I don't believe in socialism/communism, in which everyone is equal, yada yada, but I believe there is a balance between such ideas and our concept of a meritocracy. My goal isn't to make everyone equal, as if everyone is a cookie cutter model, but it's to make sure everyone succeeds. This stagnates economies and destroys the incentive to work. Basic income ensures everyone can meet a decent living standard while at the same time maintaining our current capitalist system, which, in its best moments, acts as a meritocracy.

But yeah, going back to the concept of rights. Within the system I described, rights are rules or goals for government to follow in...governing. When we establish a right to privacy, for example, we are saying that government shouldn't spy on us, and that this is good for us, and good for society. When we say everyone should have freedom of speech, we say it because we tried censorship in Europe, and it wasn't good, so it's good for society everyone should have a voice. Rights are constructs through which we accomplish the two goals I told you about...to guarantee life and enhance human well being. 

Now, I recognize that government doesnt always do these things, but when it doesn't, it's corrupt and should be brought within compliance of such imperatives.

My ideas are loosely based on Jean Jacques Rousseau's version of the social contract theory, which indicates that people submit to governance because it is beneficial for them. In theory at least, the relationship becomes dissolved (or in modern societies where there is not dissolving, alienated) when government doesn't accomplish such goals, and you're simply yielding to force, rather than actually believing in what the government is doing, and might doesnt necessarily equal right.

Libertarians have a very negative view here...that government in itself is inherently evil and is just a bunch of men with guns...that's a very skewed outlook. Government, in theory at least, should represent the interests of the people, and preserve and enhance their lives. While it doesnt always do these things, and can become corrupted (this is something to worry about, admittedly), that doesn't mean that we should be inherently anti government...we just need to make sure government represents the right interests...which are those of the people, not of themselves and not of the elites (although elites should have some say, they are people after all, just not a disproportionate say). At best, the government is the servant of the people. 

Honestly, I think this is a better approach than simply relying on abstract notions of rights. Rights, especially when taken to the extreme, seem to be a very clunky way of serving humanity. I guess it's better than nothing, but it falls into the same pitfalls divine command theory does....follow these ideas no matter their merit, no matter their cost, and treat them as moral absolutes even if this can cause problems. For me, the imperatives of human life and human well being come first, since without such things you're literally acting against the very purposes of having morality and government in the first place, and rights come forth from this as structures to enhance such purposes."
lynn,ADHD,1388990724.0,"I did do my phone calls, laundry, and sidecarring the crib. It may have taken more than 1 day though, and the phone calls did not resolve the issues. So I'll have to finish that on Monday.

Every day:

- Take daughter to YMCA play if she's not showing signs of illness (she can't possibly be contagious anymore, but she's still sometimes got a runny nose and a cough). First day back, maybe stop in at the pool to show off the new baby. [2.5 hours including travel time]
- Work on a page from daughter's preschool workbook, or some other school-like activity. [15 min]
- Record morning weight and daily food intake on MyFitnessPal app. [a few seconds here and there]
- Dishes [15 min]
- Find a place for any object [edit: meaning one thing per day, at least] that has no home. [5 min]
- Bedtime is directly after last evening baby feeding between 9 and 11. 11 is too late! 10 is preferred.

Monday: 

- ~~call the pediatrician to add my daughter to my son's visit which I need to try to move to earlier in the week~~
- ~~now that the office is open, make dentist appointment for cracked tooth [Edit: computers are down; they'll call me back] [2 min]~~
- knit square for friend's baby blanket collaboration [an hour or two after daughter goes to bed]
- ~~get wipes and possibly diapers (if they're on sale) from Target. The boy is a big one, but he's not quite ready for size 2. Also look at shoes for daughter, though they probably won't have any that fit [2 hours including travel time and baby feeding]~~
- if I get to it, text or call my friend to set up regular play-dates [5 min, maybe, spread out over the day]
- also if I get to it, rearrange monitors (again) [30 min]
- Remaining stuff for Monday: workbook with daughter; dinner; find a place for something; knit square. Oo, an episode of Sherlock while knitting, if daughter is in bed by 8:30. Good thing she doesn't need a bath. [Edit: yeah...none of that happened. I seemed to be out of willpower by evening and the lure of Reddit was too strong.]

Tuesday:

- ~~YMCA even if she's coughing a little in the morning again.~~ She's not contagious and it's been nearly a month. She needs social time. Get out of the apartment by 11 am at the very latest. Prefer 10:30. Bring knitting!
- Get to breastfeeding support group right at 2 pm (leave at 1:30) so I can get my questions answered and be out of there by 3 [1.5 hours]. Might skip this -- the issues seem to have resolved themselves, or they're nearly resolved -- and do workbook page with daughter during this time instead. [Should've gone...had lunch instead.]
- ~~Take daughter to much-needed tumbling class at 3:30.~~ This will continue weekly. While there, look at other classes/activities to enroll her in. [1.5 hours probably, maybe 2]

Wednesday:

- ~~Find new shoes for daughter. Also a belt. [2 hours, probably]~~ [shoes done on Monday...where the fuck do you find belts for 3-year-olds???]
- ~~11 am dentist appointment. Pick up husband at 10:45 to look after kids...that means I have to leave by 10:20, which means I have to start leaving at 9:50, which means shower by 9:15 which means set alarm for 9 am....Done.~~
- ~~1:45 doc appointment for daughter, followed by son's appointment. [2 hours]~~
- Bring daughter to play at the other YMCA? because she left willingly yesterday even though she was very tired and really wanted to stay. Could get there by...3 maybe? 3:30?

Thursday:

- ~~First thing in the morning: get her prescription filled (ear infection)~~
- Schedule visits to local kids' museums and zoos on calendar [15-30 min]
- Visit educational store hours before the school day ends, so that daughter can play and the line won't be 10 people long. [several hours]
- ~~IKEA store visit?~~ nevermind, that's not going to happen
- ~~Tumbling class at 3:30, since it turns out there's a Thursday one too. Home by 5~~ [Nope, she's sick]
- ~~Laundry [2 hours]~~

Friday:

- ~~tend sick daughter -- medicine 2x/day~~
- mail stuff (FIL's sunglasses, BIL's hard drive)
- put laundry away
- figure out dinners and make grocery list. Costco?
- Attack daughter's toys. Organize, somehow. [several hours, spread out across the day]
- [edit: fuck this day. I finally left home at 4 pm for the post office (still getting used to having 2 kids...aw who am I kidding, I put the older one in front of the TV and slept in with the baby, but in my defense I really did need the sleep (nevermind that I'm typing this after midnight), and then I was on Reddit too long after baby feedings when I should have put him down and gotten a shower hours before). Anyway, I slashed one of my tires on a curb on the way there, so I made it to neither the post office nor costco. And now I have to get new tires tomorrow. Or maybe I'll wait till Monday so we have a car this weekend. Got an errand or two to run tomorrow anyway].

Saturday/Sunday:

- daughter's medicine 2x/day
- Tires
- Have husband take daughter out for 2+ hours; organize her toys. Write down categories and approximate measurements for each.
- Determine storage solution for toys.
- Toys may wait till Monday."

I'm thrilled that you are making so many conscientious choices. The animals appreciate each and every vegan meal you eat.

But you aren't vegan because you're only against animal exploitation when you feel like it, and other times you participate in their exploitation because you feel like it. That's not how veganism works. Sorry. But thanks for your conscientiousness. Someday you'll get over indulging your momentary whims and realize that no 10 second taste bud experience is worth the suffering of a sentient being, no matter how badly you want it to be.

SublethalDose,aspergers,1388990921.0,"&gt; I feel like this is holding my whole life back. The whole thing interrupts my focus. Trying to ignore it just makes it come back a week later twice as strong.

You speak with a clarity that I only gained in hindsight.  I was struck with the same distraction when I was around your age, and my attempts to ignore it just resulted in wasted time.  You might as well concentrate on this problem right now, because it won't let you concentrate on anything else.

&gt; I just want to get the monkey off of my back get on with the rest of my life.

Virginity isn't really a thing.  It's a completely made-up idea invented thousands of years ago to regulate the sexual behavior of women and measure their marriage value.  If you just have sex and there's nothing else to it, the monkey won't come off your back.  You'll be sixty seconds more sexually experienced than you are now, nothing more.  It might be worth your time to just pay for sex and see what I mean.  (Standard disclaimer:  Assuming prostitution is legal where you live, of course.)

&gt; I tried asking the people around me what I was doing wrong and they won't give me straight honest answers. They either say there is noting wrong or avoid answering the question at all.

They're being as honest as they know how.  This all worked out for them naturally, so naturally, they think that's how it's supposed to work out for you.  Completely unhelpful.  Ignore them.

You have a much longer road ahead of you than you realize.  Get curious about why people do the things they do.  Why do women have sex?  What emotions drive them and inhibit them?  People talk about relationships all the time; what the hell is a relationship?  (Not just the capital-R ""Relationship"" than a boyfriend and girlfriend are ""In"" but the little-r relationships that exist between all people just like all massive particles have gravitational interactions.)  How do relationships develop between men and women?  How do the intentions and emotions of one person affect the intentions and emotions of another person?  How do people signal intentions and emotions?  How do people feel about other people's feelings?  Don't trust any angry or reductionist answers.  

The purpose of all that curiosity and learning is to put flesh on the bones of the following narrative:

* People have sexual desires.  Two people meet each other.  They find each other sexually attractive.  They develop an emotional connection that creates a favorable context for fulfilling their sexual desires.  They have sex.

That's the basic narrative.  Fleshing it out is one of the most complicated things humans do, but you have a lot of examples to learn from.  The PUA way of fleshing it out was never going to work for you, by the way.  I mean, if Asperger's is really your problem, you aren't going to score with a girl whose greatest sexual turn-on is to be socially outwitted and emotionally manipulated.  That just isn't your strong suit.  You're going to score with a girl who sees who you are, sees your feelings towards her, sees your feelings towards yourself, sees your intentions, and sees something of value for herself in the interaction.

The mirena doesn't have long-lasting effects on your period, so if you chose to have it removed, or once the 5 years is up and you get it removed, within a few months your periods will return and you can try another BC method or start a family if you wish.

What you are experiencing is totally normal and very common, however its understandably frustrating. sadly there is not much that can be done other than to consider a different BC method. The good news is that you are protected from pregnancy and your mirena is not causing any physical harm."

There is a strong cultural wariness of outsiders in this country that boasts a mostly homogenous natural born Japanese population. This leads to things like foreigners having trouble finding apartments to live in, foreigners not being allowed in hot springs in certain places, and public demonstrations where men stand on top of black vans shouting about how the foreigners should go home. These cases don't represent the entire population, of course, but many expats deal with those very interactions. And it's racism.

neekz0r,explainlikeimfive,1388991419.0,"IITT: People who don't understand ISPs.

Torrents work by taking a file, and splitting it up into pieces that it doles out. When you first start out, your torrent software says ""I need *these* pieces"", and the other torrenters that have it allow you to download it. In return, other torrenters connect up to your computer and download the pieces of file that you have. Once you have 100% of the file, you are now seeding the file. 

&gt; why is this a concept that ISPs are able to track, 

A few different ways. Usually they can track unencrypted torrents by looking at the data that is sent through them. Other times, they can track by common ports. Finally, they can track aggressively by connecting to a torrent port on your computer.


&gt; and why does an internet connection degrade significantly if a torrent client is running?

Most people are connected by cable modems. As such, their upload bandwidht is significantly smaller than their download bandwidth. When you are providing pieces of the torrent file (or the full thing if you are a seed) it is likely saturating your upload. This can have a degraded affect on nearly everything. Other times, if your upload and download speed is equal, it affects both and again, your bandwidth is degraded.

mundabit,birthcontrol,1388991639.0,"Different formulations of pills are more notorious than others for side effects, and some women will get side effects with one formulation but not with others. Don't be afraid of the pill due to side effects, but do take note of ""deal breaker"" side effects and what formulation of pill you are taking, and what formulation you have yet to try and don't be afraid to tell your HCP that the current pill is not ideal, and you want a diffrent one.

For example I was on 3000 µg drospirenone, 20 µg ethinyl estradiol when I first started taking the pill. I experianced non-stop bleeding, weight gain and vomiting, Those were deal breakers, so I tried a pill with 150 µg levonorgestrel 30 µg ethinyl estradiol and I did not have the same side effects, In fact that pill worked very well for me and I had no negative side effects at all. (my breasts grew, I lost weight, my skin got clearer!)

I have a veru similar cycle to you without the pill, I would bleed during ovulation, bleeding would last 2-3 days and be accompanied by stabbing pain on one side. a week  and a half later I would start my period, It would last 8-12 days and be very heavy, on the first 5 days I physically can not move for pain, I use crutches to get around on days I can, My legs are non-responsive and I throw up 3-7 times a day no matter what I eat. I have menstrual migraine syndrome too. The pill was the best thing I ever did for my cycle, Sure the first pill I took wasn't great. but with trail and effort I found what I consider my ""miracle cure to periods"" it was amazing. I had shorter, less painful periods that were regular, and because I was taking a combination pill I had *no* ovulation pain or bleeding.

I only wish my pill was still legally available to me in my country, no other method has worked quite as well.

simply put, your problems will benefit from some kind of hormonal management like birth control, there are many methods to chose from, but the pill is generally the first one you should try, don;t be nervous, if it doesn't work out, the side effects are reversible, and you can try again with another method."

Well, we're not really worried about collateral damage, considering the nature of what we face. This isn't some guerilla insurgency, or some some militia. This is *giant fucking horrifying monsters that regenerate and are made using corpses of what they ate.* No one would give two shits about collateral damage. 

You're changing the fight in order to favor one side. 

First scenario, 2 million normal titans spread out through the country are much easier to kill than 2 million titans in a wave. Humans win.

Scenario, the US nukes the area because 2 million titans attacking in a wave is probably the biggest threat to humanity that has ever existed. 

The only threat that the military would have trouble with is the female titan, due to her armor. If she just protects the back of her neck, conventional military weapons would have difficulty dealing with her. If there was an army of female titans with those powers, that would do some damage. A nuke would generate enough heat to cook her nervous system, so all two million in a clump would be a bad idea. They would deal the most damage by spreading out, as in the first scenario you listed. That being said, abnormals tend to de-titanify (it's late) when they get tired, and she can't protect her entire body. It would be a much more difficult win, but due to the armor only ever appearing in one place at the time the military would be blasting limbs off of the things and bombarding them when they're rendered immobile."

Beastafer,relationships,1388991712.0,"OP,

You and me, let's talk real quick.

1) I find it very weird that she would take a random pill while alone at a party.

Sure, people can downvote me to hell, but if my GF took a pill while she was without me at a party I would be extremely upset. If she got raped, sure, we would definitely talk about that, but the biggest issue I would have is ""Hey, why the fuck did you put yourself in this situation?""

This isn't ""blaming the victim"" like SRS would want you to think, but if you got blacked out and walked through a horrible part of your town, would you not think something might happen to you?

2) Do you believe her?

You honestly don't have to. It might make you seem like a dick to other guys, but her argument is ""Hey, I went to a party alone, took a pill, and got raped"" then I would say ""1) Why do you go to a party alone 2) Why did you take a random pill.""  I'm not being an asshole, I'm just wondering why a person who should know better would put themselves in that situation.

3) Do you think you can move on from this?

It seems a little suspect to me. 

I'll be honest: I'm very 50/50 on the whole ""rape"" thing. Sure, the pill might have been a rape-pill, and if that's the case then she should have gotten tested the day after. If you go to your local pharmacy you can easily get a test that will show if you have date-rape chemicals in your body. If she didn't get tested for that, or if she didn't tell me about this whole incident sooner, well no offense to her but I would think ""Why didn't you tell me all this the day after?""

Furthermore: What the fuck? I would really question why the fuck she put herself in that situation. If she got her drink spiked then that's completely different, but that doesn't seem the case.

OP, go ahead and PM me if you have anymore questions. I'm not assuming your GF did anything bad, but I'm a good sounding-board that won't downvote you simply because you have a differing opinion than the sheeple of /r/SRS and tumblr."

WeaponsGradeHumanity,WTF,1388991760.0,"&gt;Just because an entity is in the moment, ill-suited for a different environment, doesn't mean that it's not an individual entity.  

This is a disgustingly deceptive way of putting it.  A foetus isn't just ""ill-suited for a different environment"", it is completely dependent on the mother.  The mother's womb is the only place it can survive at all and without spending a significant amount of time in that womb it cannot ever become suited for any other type of environment at all.  A foetus is part of the mother because it is *inseperable* from that mother.  

&gt;Generally speaking [...] at that time.  

A foetus is not an individual.  A foetus is not a person.  A foetus does not have volition.  A foetus doesn't even have any of the body parts necessary for volition to be an option.

dirfarg,bodybuilding,1388991859.0,"Most people will see more mass gain on programs like allpro for the exact reason you mentioned. The literature shows a particular ""sweetspot"" for rep ranges as too little won't provide enough stimulus and too much leads to

 1) too long of a recovery with no further gain

 2) excess glycogen depletion which can interfere with hypertrophy

As for what that sweetspot is, it depends on what meta analysis or coach you ask. My favorite is the Wernborn meta that found 40-60 reps **per body part** in one session (optimally twice a week). That means in one week per body part for hypertrophy, you'd need anywhere from 80-120 reps. Starting strength doesn't come even close with a whopping 15 reps/session for each bodypart. It gets a bit more complicated when you start talking about fiber recruitment since starting strength calls for high intensity (often 80+ RM) and this will lead to full fiber recruitment and thus ""effective reps"" for hypertrophy but taking this into account still leaves a pretty big gap in volume. 

Now you may say ""wait a minute if volume leads to better hypertrophy why not just make starting strength 5x5 or 7x5 to meet the volume requirements?"". And it turns out that programs that are 5x5 are indeed better for hypertrophy. The drawback is that strength gains slow down faster on programs like that. 3x5 will keep you making linear gains for longer than 5x5 (which is why many 5x5 programs will taper down after you reach enough plateaus). And in the end, that's what starting strength is meant to do. It's meant to get you stronger. You'll get bigger for sure, but it's not anywhere near optimal and why people report more gains on programs like all pros."

Ozzimo,NoStupidQuestions,1388991887.0,"The big thing to know when it comes to teacher pay is that it's incredibly hard to measure the impact one teacher is having on their students. We've all had good and bad teachers as well as hated and loved teachers. They good ones weren't always our favorites and the bad ones weren't always terrible to be around. Test scores only show how well the teacher prepared you for the test. Also it's always possible that the older you get, the more teachers had a hand in teaching you. So this compounds the issue.

All of the leads to the Teacher's Union agreeing to only increase pay by years served as opposed to ""tests passed."" or the like. It's the most fair way to generalize the skill of the teacher (while still being wrong a lot of the time.)

So it's possible that one day we'll find ways to adequately pass ""All-Star"" teachers but the metric for designating that teacher as an All-Star needs to be discovered first.

TheGuyWhoDoesThings,AskReddit,1388991900.0,"Actually no, in fact if anything the elevator would fall slower since it has slightly more friction due to the guide beams in the actual shaft part. The car only has wind resistance, the elevator has the friction of guide beams AND wind resistance. Mass has nothing to do with how things fall. Ever seen the classic hammer vs feather drop on the moon? If not, look it up. They drop and hit the ground at the same time. Mass has nothing to do with the drop rate, only friction forces (such as wind resistance).

I mentioned inertia earlier and how it would affect how much upward force you'll be able to exert. Here's an example of inertia, you kick a soccer ball (very light) and kick a bowling ball (heavy) with the same force. You can get the soccer ball to go faster because it has less mass. They will still retain the same force however. 

Here's a GREAT example actually. Watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLuI118nhzc
You can in fact achieve the same affect with a falling object. The cannon is apply the same force on the car as it is on the soccer ball. So even though you really can't measure it (since it's so slight in this case), the cannon is also acceleration/speeding up the car as it's speeding up the soccer ball.

No idea, that's a good question. If you're only able to jump at 3 mph max, it won't do that much of a difference when you're traveling at 50mph downwards. But if it's in the very first moment of free fall, when you're maybe going 5ish mph you could reduce impact noticeably."

tangerinelion,Coffee,1388992258.0,"AP is very versatile, the fact you used an AP to brew the coffee tells you almost nothing about what the coffee is like :)

I use it more like a french press, really, taking advantage of the paper filter to get a cup with practically no silt even with a fine grind.  Which is good, because the hand grinder I have (Hario Mini) is consistent enough at fine settings for this to work, and work well, while on coarse settings it's really not consistent (but luckily FPs are also forgiving of an inconsistent grind so the result works - provided you wait between plunging and pouring as you have some fines in the result.)

But you can also use it to make a coffee concentrate (it will never make espresso).  That's simply due to it being a full-immersion method, unlike pour over &amp; drip.  A FP also works to do this, but you have a minimum capacity that's greater than the AP due to the different plunger mechanism and how a FP always leaves behind a certain amount."

Furthermore, what about (heterosexual) men who are already perfectly satisfied with women? If he is already golden in that area, why would he want to change what he does? Same goes for men who do not desire to seduce women or specifically hope *not* to, such as unichs or those sworn to celibacy.

I don't think it happens in *every* hospital, and I'm certain that the dr's aren't pushing for malicious reasons or not caring about the women, but there has been a lot of cases where womens birthing process was fine, but taking too long.

Omega037,changemyview,1388992289.0,"I'm not surprised that you are confused because the ""null hypothesis"" argument is common one when arguing about theism, and it is often parroted without understanding.  

The point is that something existing or not existing is irrelevant to the question.  Setting the null hypothesis is about testing assumptions, regardless of what those assumptions are.

If your goal is to prove god exists, you must reject the null hypothesis that god does not exist.

If you goal is to prove god does not exist, you must reject the null hypothesis that god does exist.

Perhaps if I reword the assumptions, it might be easier to understand.  Instead of saying ""god exists"" or ""god doesn't exist"", what if I worded it as ""a godless universe doesn't exist"" or ""a godless universe does exist"".

This has the same exact meaning as the original assumptions, but according to your definition, the one that is ""doesn't exist"" must be the null hypothesis.  Thus, ""a godless universe doesn't exist"" is now the null hypothesis."

jubbergun,TumblrInAction,1388992446.0,"&gt; Clearly there are degrees of thuggery, genocide and the smithsonian are clearly not comparable, yet are you trying to argue that using general tax revenue to fund a series of museums (which aren't without controversy) is social thuggery?

Yes, though I wasn't aware anyone looked upon the Smithsonian as controversial.  The National Endowment for the Arts, on the other hand, falls squarely into that territory.  I would gladly contribute some of my own personal funds to funding something like the Smithsonian if it weren't a publicly funded institution.  I'm sure I'm not alone in that.  I think there are enough people who would volunteer to support such an institution that we don't need to force others into supporting it with their tax dollars.

&gt; The frustrating thing when debating most libertarians (or similar) is that very few actually acknowledge that not everything a government does is truly awful.

Well, to be fair, there are a lot of liberal/progressives who are loathe to concede that the government does a poor job at anything.  Both engage in this denial for the same reason, which is that they'd rather not give ground to those who oppose their views for the sake of being reasonable.  I realize government is a necessary evil, and while some libertarians choose to focus on the ""evil"" and some progressives choose to focus on the ""necessary,"" I try to find a balance between the two.  It doesn't always work.  I'm as prone to knee-jerk reactions as the next guy.

&gt; Arguments to do with the social contract don't really work if any problems would be solved by decentralisation/single payer/better administration.

I'd be willing to agree with this if not for the fact that, especially here in the US, we've been trying pretty much the same approach to every social problem for anywhere from 40-80 years.  We never try a new solution, we simply toss greater sums of money into the same programs expecting a better result, generally with disappointing results.  I don't think we can really say that our problems wouldn't be solved by new solutions until we resolve to stop doing what isn't working (or isn't working well enough) and try new approaches."

Bullshit. While tall people are often seen as more powerful, the back side of this is that it's MUCH easier for tall people(especially men) to be seen as aggressive and thus a danger.

Yea, if you consider the inability to comfortably travel with ANY public transportation, the inability to (in many cases) get stylish clothes that actually fit properly, and the above mentioned ""danger tag"" a minor inconvenience, then sure.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388992656.0,"Well here's the thing, once again, libertarianism seems to think of people as islands unto themselves. We live in a VERY interconnected society, your actions affect others, and as a result, yes, the government has a right to step in and say what is best.

And no, we'll always have force, yet another concept i don't think ancaps in particular understand well. Government, theoretically leads to that minimal force though. Back in the olden days, people sought justice on others through violence. The reason the state does it now is to act as an impartial mediator that comes to better conclusions.

There's a lot of things government does better than individuals do, quite frankly. I mean, sure, you COULD try this consensual agreements bullcrap, but in my observation, they're nowhere as consensual as they sound (ie, it's one side with a lot of bargaining power imposing their will on the other that has little....you need to keep in mind government power isn't the only power that exists)."

I was up in mid-Ibaraki during the big old earthquake, lost power, occupied myself somehow through the rest of one day, then went out looking for food the next morning. I ended up at a restaurant near my apartment that had an interior that served traditional stuff, and an outdoor section that was just a yakitoriya with food service from inside if you sat at their little picnic tables. The guy was open, I think because the fridge wasn't working, but their fires were, so they were serving all comers.

I sat down with my yakitori, my beer, and entered into the ""in-group"" of people who had experienced the earthquake. There were several older Japanese men, a youngish couple with pregnant wife, and myself. One of the old men bought basically everything I ate after the yakitori, and bought beer for everyone. We chatted, we laughed, he fed me raw whale, which was delicious.

Then he sat back and started crying, swelling with pride that his country had brought these people together. He was elated the girl was pregnant, he was apparently happy I was there (foreigner, teaching English), and was so happy to be sharing.

poryphria,kpop,1388993178.0,"Let me just say that I've fallen in love with the CD cover.  If you know anything about classical coins, I think putting TVXQ's faces on it was kind of awesome/hilarious at the same time.  Emperors of K-Pop indeed.  Also, some of the links don't work (SM was fast this time), so I had to improvise.

**1. Ten Years** has some interesting lyrics.  Nice way to start off the album.  4/5

**2. Something** is really freaking good.  5/5

**3. Your Man** didn't stick with me after my first play-through.  Right now it's one of my least favorites.  2.5/5

**4. Moonlight Fantasy** has a great chorus (and I mean a great chorus), but it does suffer from boring verses.  4/5

**5. Beside** is a lower-key song that I love.  4.5/5

**6. Double Trouble** is another great track.  4.5/5

**7. Off Road** was one of the songs that stuck out when I listened to the teaser.  It's not as amazing as I thought it would be, but it's one of the better songs on the album.  4/5

**8. Smoky Heart**  Why are there so many slower songs on this album?  Besides the vocals, there's nothing special about this song.  3/5

**9. Love Again** isn't a bad song, but like most ballads, I'm not going to listen to it more than twice. 3/5

**10. Steppin'** is giving me 2008 DBSK vibes.  4/5

**11. Rise...** is *the* obligatory ballad.  It has the instrumental of every OST ballad in every single corny Korean drama, and I can't believe SM used this composition.  TVXQ deserves better, and with a title like ""Rise..."", you'd think it'd be a great song.  2.5/5

**12. 항상 곁에 있을게** is a good choice for the ending track; finally, something a little more upbeat!  4.5/5

**3.9/5!**

I've been a DBSK/TVXQ fan for almost 7 years now (7 years in March!), so I've been through their greatest years and their worst.  This album is a total 180 from Catch Me, and it didn't meet my expectations (too many slower songs!!!), but the good songs made up for the bad (or boring) songs.  Happy 10 years, TVXQ!"

&gt;Where did you get the idea that I thought we must decrease funding for women's health?

The idea is apparent when you compare women and men's health funding and declare that the disparity itself is a problem. 

The fact is that women's health awareness and funding was sought on the basis of women's health being an issue.

Instead of merit, you are basing the conclusion men's health needs more funding on how *women's health issues get more funding*.

I would like to think men's health issues could raise awareness without taking a stab at how successful women's health groups have been at raising money and awareness. Perhaps men's groups devoted to raising the life expectancy of men on merit, rather than focusing on the concept that ""funding should be equal"".

Not to mention, funding != success. Perhaps less money is necessary to do the research to increase the life expectancy of men? I'm personally under the impression that some of the breast cancer awareness non-profits such as Susan G. Komen are just money sucking entities that have actual little interest in solving the real problem.

Cashflow is not a guarantee for solutions, so saying that having equal funding to women's health is misleading because it might not actually solve anything."

First of all lets examine your girlfriends motives. Shes trying to shame you for your past relationship in an effort to extract material wealth via guilt. That's a pretty shitty/ immature thing to do. Now alot of the comments here are going to tell you to cave in and have this girl fist you in the place where it hurts the most: the wallet.

There are two ways to play the game. The first is to not play the game and dump her for being a manipulative bitch.

The second is to say yes I did do these things for my ex girlfriend but she did alot of things for me that you don't do. I have nothing against you for it but me and my ex had a much more **reciprocal** relationship. I like our relationship too but we are more independent of one another. Then shes going to go absolute batshit what do you mean reciprocal? Shell get all jelous and moody and insecure. This is when you strike.
Well sometimes my girlfriend would do my laundry. Sometimes she would wake up early and cook me breakfast. She realy didnt like it in the butt but she would do it for me. She brought a girl over for a threesome on my birthday. Some of these can be lies its okay. What your doing at this point is renegotiating the terms of your relationship. She wants you to buy her shit, thats cool. But relationships are a give and take. What is she willing to give in exchange for what she wants?"

Before I saw it I read someone say that Elsa's curse was a great metaphor for anxiety or depression. I watched with that in mind and oh my gosh. It's just so perfect. Like, there's these intense feelings. Sometimes feeling things intensely can be beautiful in a way, but if you expel it outward it can hurt people. She has some line about ""tame the storm within"" and the whole ""conceal, don't feel"" lines. Her parents tell her just don't let it show. Control it. They do that because it seems like the right thing, not out of malice, but the more she tries to shove it down the more out of control it gets. There's that one scene with Anna outside going ""just let me in"" and zoom up so on one side there's Anna in the colors (though muted) and Elsa alone in a frozen up room. She wants to let her in, but can't. 

The music is so beautiful. The vocals are spectacular. They're catchy and sometimes heartbreaking. You can hear the emotions be they happy or whimsical or fearful.

Then, while I must say I've never minded the Disney romantic formula, I was blown away by the act of true love at the end. I don't have a sibling, but I just think it's great that they showed true love isn't just romantic love. It's love of family too.  I also loved that while Anna gets engaged in, like, an hour no one else in the movie backs this decision. They all go ""wut? no.""  

I like that Anna is clumsy. I like that she's so excitable and she feels like a whole character. I like that her bad decisions don't actually work out in that fairy tale way. 

I like that Sven is an animal character that doesn't talk, but instead Kristoff does this too cute for words voice over because it just reminds me of how some people will have both sides of a conversation with their pets. I think Kristoff in general is just great. He's not the charming prince. He's kinda goofy,  yet incredibly endearing. 

It's a fantastic movie. I just have so much love for it on so many levels. "

sockalicious,changemyview,1388994162.0,"I was sorry to hear about your illness.

That's because you're a human and I'm a human.  I'm partial to you, even knowing nothing else about you but that. Knowing that you have a spinal disease, to me, means that you are experiencing a very certain kind of suffering.  You're one of mine and that means my heart goes out to you.  You're part of a special group; a group from which I select all my friends, all my lovers, and in fact most of my enemies. 

If you were just a monkey, I'd quickly adjudge you unfit to be my pet and I'd put you down.  But you're a human.  That makes you special to me.

Technology has allowed our species - yours and mine - to expand to a population of over 6 billion, far over our ideal carrying capacity - and to expand to every habitat, climate and biome on Earth.  Technology has enabled us to totally trash a lot of those biomes; technology has assisted us to wage global mechanized and nuclear wars, slaughtering millions of our own kind.  No other species does those things; nature is red in tooth and claw but She doesn't wage wars and She rarely scorches the Earth the way our species seems to do as a matter of habit.

Those are the two reasons for our human exceptionalism; one is simply that we draw our friends, lovers and enemies from our own kind; another is that we do negative things on grand, un-Natural scales.  The former will probably never change (the furries may disagree); the latter is something we better be thinking about if we want to not go the way of the dodo.  

Luckily, humans are capable of introspection, time-binding, prediction of the future, and altering our individual and collective behaviors to achieve goals, even if those goals are to be met after all of our individual deaths.  Those are other things that animals can't do and it's why our species is going to remain special and exceptional far into the future."

I'll admit that seeing things like that a lot will put a real damper on you and I mean, this is an Internet forum, there is no lack of shit anywhere. And while I really don't like posts that don't really add to the discussion, calling someone out on being an irrational whiner seems necessary sometimes. I'll be the first to admit that it could be done better in 90% of the cases but still.

I also think there are many, many conflicting experiences and resulting world-views here also. Sometimes I can't believe I live on the same planet as many descriptions I have read on here, and vice versa."
GayLubeOil,TheRedPill,1388994297.0,From your post history I can tell you're a woman. You've probably never dated a woman you've probably never tried to sleep with a woman. Unless your a lesbian which is statistically unlikely. Women are attracted to cocky dickish behavior. They like it when men tease them and tell them what to do. They like it when men set boundaries. Now you can sit here all day and say im a misogynist and that I have outdated world views. Or you can pretend to be a lesbian try to court women and figure out what strategies are most successful. What you will find is that what most women are attracted to isn't politically correct.

savoytruffle,AskReddit,1388994837.0,"In America it's mainly regarding the [US 14th Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution).

The gist is this:

     All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

This was intended to be one of three amendments to the constitution to outlaw slavery, but its liberal wording makes it pretty wild for any liberal purpose even nowadays.

It's been yrs but since then I've made it a goal in my life to never make the same mistakes again. I challenged myself to be the best person I can be and start living for myself. Perhaps it was the best thing that ever happened to be but at the same time it's hard to say that I wouldn't have been happy had we stayed together.

blackboxstar,Parenting,1388995110.0,"I've had to force feed a child medicine.  It sucks and it isn't for the faint of heart.

 Sit in a chair with your left ankle resting on your right knee.  Seat your child on your lap so that her legs go to your right.  

Using your left arm reach around her body and securely pin her left arm down with your hand.  Her right arm should be firmly but securely pinned against your body. 

Lean her back so that her head is resting on your bent knee.  My experience is that the tantrum begins here.

Wait until an exhaling scream and squirt 1/4 tsp or about 2ml of medicin into her mouth.  It has to be small especially if they fight it.  Wait.  Expect gurgling, attempts at spitting, pitiful looks, well placed gymnast kicks to the face, and coughing.

Once she swallows immediately allow her to sit up.  Give her a moment to get her bearings rinse and repeat.

You might find it easier to sit normally and seat her straddling your lap then lean her back over both knees.  My experience is this leaves them more room to kick and fight and its harder to stop them from turning their heads to spit the medicine out.

You might also ask your doctor about pills.  She's young, but if she hates liquid medicine that much it might be easier to teach her to swallow a pill than fight her at every dose."

citadel_lewis,DebateReligion,1388995665.0,"&gt;&gt;Okay, but you have to admit that even with this distinction there are examples of theists and atheists whose beliefs are guided by faith.

&gt;But the issue here is that there is an attempt to equivocate what that means. Faith suddenly becomes another way to say ""The belief that god doesn't exist without justification"". I don't deny that SOME atheists certainly have faith in some forms, but the idea listed is that atheism does not *require* faith as pointed out in the OP.

You're the one equivocating. You'll say anything and change meanings just to avoid the fact that not all theists base their belief on faith and not all atheists base their beliefs in reason. *You actually admit that some atheists use faith but then for some reason ask me further down to accept they don't*.

&gt;&gt;That is a false dichotomy - I wasn't saying that people can either know mutually exclusive things or they can not know anything.

&gt;It's not a false dichotomy, it's just a misunderstanding of what has been said. 

It *was* a false dichotomy. Based on a misunderstanding.

&gt;Two different people can be said (under the way I use know in a way that we can actually obtain ""knowledge"") to hold different and mutually exclusive things. They can have beliefs that are reasonably justified *even if you don't agree*. Not every issue is clearly cut. But if knowledge is in the realm of the absolute, we cannot ever actually obtain knowledge. You didn't say it, I said it and I didn't set it up as a dichotomy, I said ""this is better than that"" not ""These are the only two options"".

Please read up on what constitutes a justified, true belief (ie knowledge). It isn't the all or nothing thing that you portray, but there is certainly more needed than what you claim. There really is no point continuing until you get this. It is a basic foundation of epistemology and you can't just dismiss it because it doesn't suit your purposes.

&gt;&gt;But that is not knowledge. Maybe I'm being philosophically pedantic, but I believe we must be.

&gt;If knowledge is as you stated, a justified true belief, then clearly we can have knowledge, but we simply cannot actually obtain that we have knowledge (Can't know what we know). 

No, please read up on knowledge in the sense of a justified, true belief. You can't just go against a whole academic discipline to suit your own purposes.

&gt;I'm sure you can agree that we can:

&gt; *  Have beliefs
 * Justify those beliefs (Well, hopefully)
 * That some of those beliefs might even accurately reflect reality (be true)

&gt;If this is the case then we CAN (potentially) have justified true beliefs, because nothing in the epistemological understanding of that actually requires that we know what is true, only that we believe it justifiably. 

No, once again, this is not how it goes. If you want to talk about knowledge, these are the basics.

&gt;One objection to that would be to claim that our beliefs can never accurately reflect reality, which is again absurd because (as you brought up dichotomies earlier and that some are false) surely you agree that some dichotomies can be true? As there are people that fall on two sides of an issue that can only be true or false (relevant: God's existence) then obviously there are at least SOME people who believe both of these things, at least some of them are justified in that belief and it MUST be true for one of them, thus that objection cannot apply.

**But neither one knows their belief is true, therefore it is not knowledge but a belief**. Again, please research justified, true beliefs.

&gt;&gt;That's fine, and is how someone who believes in God can show that their belief is not based on faith, but reason. It's the same with atheists, in my opinion, but they desperately deny it because of the negative associations they have applied to it.

&gt;I don't deny that SOME atheists have faith under some definitions, but NOT the one in question here. Again, it is also as OP pointed out, not a requirement for atheism as much as it is for most forms of theism.

It is not a requirement at all for theism. I am a theist, yet I have no faith in God. I base my beliefs in reason.

&gt; ""I don't believe you"" is not faith ""I don't believe you for reasons x, y, and z"" are also not faith. ""I don't believe you even though you've demonstrated that you are correct, or that my methodology is faulty in regards to your claim about deities"" would perhaps be faith, depending on whether or not it was about doctrine or a direct point about the deity's qualities.

You're only presenting an atheist responding to a theist's claims. Are you saying atheists don't make claims of their own? They do. 

&gt;&gt;Thanks for debating me civilly, without questioning my intelligence or insulting me. I really respect that. I don't think we're going to entirely agree but I acknowledge that you have sound reasoning.

Omega037,changemyview,1388995933.0,"The key here is to understand that there are not just two states, but four:

1. I believe God exists

2. I do not believe God exists

3. I believe God does not exist

4. I do not believe God does not exist

All four are distinct possibilities that are very different from each other.  If we replace ""God exists"" with X, it may be easier to see why they are distinct.

The problem with your most recent argument is that it basically implies that state 1 is the same as 4 and 2 is the same as 3.  However, it should be obvious that ""I believe X"" is not the same as ""I do not believe not X"".  The first shows a strong, positive conviction in believing X, while the second merely states a lack of information about not X.

Thus, states 1 and 3 are considered positive (or affirmative) beliefs that can be the alternative hypothesis, while 2 and 4 would be their null hypotheses respectively.

This is done with your hands and they can go in a lot of places depending on the tempo and the type of song, how close you are to your partner, (romantic, friend/family?), the height difference between the two of you and I can go more into specifics if you wish. 

But anyways, leading your partner, and the basics are the same for everything you will just gently push and pull with your hands to let your partner know which direction you are going in so they can follow. 

So I'm just going to give you a description of the most general and honestly most fun way to two step. It's a fast two step, it's spontaneous, fun, generally one hand on the hip, the other is holding her hand, fingers intertwined, off to your side and you face that direction and typically move in that direction. 

Taking a step in the direction you are facing. Always start with the foot in that direction (right foot when going right), you can move your lead  hand in small circles to the beat of the song, (your lead hand is the one you're holding her hand with) and you can gently push on her waist in the direction you want to go in.

Turning towards your partner, push gently with your lead hand in the direction of travel and pull her waist towards you. Lead with the same foot as before (the one in the direction of your lead hand) You can turn as sharp as wish. You should indicate the sharpness of your turn to your partner with the strength of your hands. Remember to be gentle.

If you want to change directions, switch hands. Remember, don't just move in small circles around the dance floor. Move around the dance floor! Have fun, and communicate with your partner. Good communication will lead to a better, more pleasurable experience for you both.

steve496,49ers,1388996169.0,"Honestly, I kind of debate the fundamental assertion.  What was working at the beginning game was actually the passing game.  On the first drive, we had 4 nice completions to move down the field while Gore netted 1 yard on 2 runs.  The pass game was working, so we stuck with it... only to have 3 incompletions in a row that caused us to kick a field goal.  Similarly, second drive we had positive plays in both the running and passing game (Gore had a run of 9 yards and a couple 4s, and Kap had completions for 9 and 12 yards)... but at the end of the drive, we tried 2 runs and a pass and only netted 4 yards.  Its not that we abruptly shifted our focus... its just that, sometimes things don't work.

Across the game as a whole, the running backs in general and Gore in particular had a mediocre game (22 runs for 70 yards, a meager 3.2 yards per attempt), and we did most of our damage with Kap throwing and scrambling - which comprised almost 2/3 of the plays we ran, a pretty healthy ratio.

I could nitpick a couple of plays in particular - for instance, the fact that we always just do power runs on 2nd and short instead of occasionally taking shots downfield drives me nuts - but on the whole I don't think there was a lot to complain about in terms of playcalling today."

SublethalDose,aspergers,1388996252.0,"Everything you said fits right into the ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" cliché, so it's a little weird to approach it as a question about Asperger's.  

&gt; I'm still learning what are aspie traits that may come off as rude/uncaring.

He needs to learn, too.  I mean...

&gt; may disappear when we have plans

Asperger's does not prevent someone from learning that this is rude.  It's a simple rule.  

&gt; How can I be a better girlfriend? (I react very emotionally to some things.)

Learn to consciously understand and articulate the things that he's getting wrong that make you emotional.   Example:  you come home and complain about being stressed out by a problem at work.  He responds by telling you how to solve the problem.  This pisses you off.  Okay, natural reaction, but not very constructive.  Try to explain to him *why* his response is counterproductive.  ""Hey, what I really need is to tell this story to a sympathetic ear.  That's why I'm telling you this.  I don't need any advice, and the last thing I want to do right now is think about how to solve the problem, because that's what I was doing all day, and that's why I'm miserable and exhausted and stressed out.""  You should cut him a lot of slack on his ability to intuit things like that in real time.  Just don't cut him any slack on flaking off on plans without telling you.

If he objects to the concept of having a conversation whose only point is emotion, tell him that handling emotions is an important practical aspect of life for you, that emotions can cause problems (I'm sure he will appreciate that point) and can bring pleasure (he can probably appreciate that as well) and that therefore you invest time and effort in tending them just like you would tend a garden.  Tell him that it matters to you how he reacts emotionally to you just like it matters to him whether you love him and care about him.  That's something he can grasp intellectually, and while it may be hard for him to recognize situations that are driven by emotional needs, he will hopefully trust you enough to let you teach him to act more appropriately.  

Don't abuse that trust, though.  Don't tell him he's being socially inappropriate over normal couple's conflicts like how often he needs to text you and how often he should answer the phone when you call him at work.  Other couples negotiate compromises over those things, and it wouldn't be fair for you to get your way 100% just because he can't effectively negotiate for himself.

Basically, if you filter out ther crap (and there is a lot of crap) this is more or less what you're left with. So well done :).

The most credible info we have is the testimony of ex military and civil officials, and although none of them have the whole story I believe that they give enough credible evidence to prove the existence of UFO's - whether they are piloted or controlled by ET/ED's is harder to ascertain. However, this foundation leads me to be unable to entirely dismiss the rest of the narrative.

if the life or long term health of the mother is at risk, then abortion is okay, but if the mother is unlikely to suffer long term health problems (death included) and the baby can be cared for in a state system(adoption/foster care) then abortion is not okay. the second case includes rape-children and high probability of disability in the child, these are not adequate excuses for abortion IMHO only when them other is at risk is it acceptable in my opinion.

ultimately it comes down to the fact that in a normal pregnancy, yes it does effect the mother, and that is unfortunate and i am not trying to downplay the possibly health/mental issues surrounding child-birth. but honestly the child in my opinion has rights as well..."

runningsalami,sweden,1388996853.0,"Att folk har avvikande åsikter och vill argumentera (som vi gör) betyder inte att man vill begränsa din rätt att uttrycka dom, så länge du inte diskriminerar folk.

Det tycks som att du verkar tro att ökad respekt för t.ex. mörkhyade eller kvinnor går på bekostnad av män/vita. Så är det inte. Inte heller är män/kvinnor eller vita/mörkhyade motsatser av varandra, vi är alla människor som har rätt till samma behandling.

När en viss politisk åsikt, som nazism, anser att man bör dela in människovärdet baserat på folkgrupp så tycker jag att det är högst angeläget att koppla politiska åsikter till männidkovärde. 

Själv är jag vit man, men också antirasist och feminist och jag ser inga motsägelser där. Antirasist definieras av att man är mot alla former av särbehandling på grund av etniskt ursprung, inte bara mot ""invandrare"". Samma sak gäller feminismen, den kämpar för att kvinnor ska ha samma möjligheter och ställning som män i samhället.

Kallar man sig antirasist men har rasistiska åsikter mot t.ex. vita, så ljuger man för sig själv. Samma sak med feminism, är du för att kvinnor ska stå över männen i könshierarkin så är du kvinnochauvinist och inte feminist.

Man ska kalla saker vid deras rätta namn, som Olof Palme en gång sa. Man bör tolka folk välvilligt, samtidigt som Internet är ett öppet forum. Bara för att du får mothugg på exempelvis Sweddit och det kan vara jobbigt, så innebär det inte att vi ska särbehandla dig och bara samtycka hela tiden. Om vi gör det får vi ett frukansvärt tråkigt debattklimat.

mundabit,birthcontrol,1388997155.0,"ok, lets make sure I have this straight. Your wife is on a Multi-phasic combination pill containing 2 or more different doses of hormones. She missed all 7 days of the lowest dose. 

so, last month she took her pills as normal and just started placebo week, you had sex, she started her period, placebo week ended, Her period ended, then she forgot to start taking the active pills again (the low dose is at the start of the pack) 

After 14 days with no hormones (placebo week being 7 days, then missing 7 days) she starts taking the second level dosage of pills *then* she realises she missed week 1. At this point she *should* of taken a total of 14 pills (7 low dose, 7 medium) but she has only taken her 7 medium (second week pills)

First off, emergency contraception is only going to be effective if taken within 72 hours, or a Copper IUD within 5 days. 

But it sounds like the last time you had sex was *before* her period, in which case the sperm would of died before she even finished her period. It is incredibly rare to ovulate *while* shedding,  and even more rare for that egg to be fertilised and embed while still shedding. If this is the sex you are concerned about, being 2 weeks ago the pregnancy test your wife took this morning should be valid.

I can offer more advice or give more specific details if you know the brand of pill your wife is taking, Its very hard to tell the timeline from your post, My best advice is to talk to a doctor about a long-term method of birth control that is more fool-proof, multi-phasic pills can be tough to navigate if you lead a busy life, pills in general are hard to keep track of in that regard."

Takuya-san,LearnJapanese,1388997213.0,"If you can't afford RTK and have moral qualms about pirating it until you have a better job, it's worth noting that the website ""Reviewing the Kanji"" has everything you need for RTK without needing the textbook. The textbook is simply useful because it gives very good guidance on the memory principles involved.  
  
I'm also a STEM student (Mechatronics Engineering) so I can definitely understand being short on time. That said, one of the awesome things about RTK's simplicity is that you can study it using your phone whenever you're on a bus, toilet, or waiting in a line.   
  
&amp;gt;the first year covers both volumes of Genki for instance   
  
Genki is a brilliant textbook, not denying that, but the problem with textbooks in general is that they involve a lot of time investment for not that much gain. You could easily be absorbing much more material in a shorter time with an SRS.   
  
Since you're doing the classes and obviously need to know the material to get decent marks, I recommend ""mining"" your textbook for phrases and vocab and popping them in Anki. Then use the extra time after studying the mined information to study RTK - set a reasonable goal like 20 RTK kanji per day (should take around 10 minutes + 15-20 minutes for reviewing previously studied kanji).  
  
Once you've reached 2000 kanji (takes around 3 months if you're doing 20 per day), you can slow down to 10 per day and focus more on other aspects of Japanese study.  
  
These are all recommendations based on my experience, of course, you're free to call me an idiot and move on with your day ;)"

Paula sent the threatening emails to Jill from the same Gmail account that she used to correspond with Petraeus. So it probably was very easy for the FBI to find out what was going on, and didn't have anything to do with unencrypted drafts.

IndieLady,videos,1388997632.0,"I think sometimes when you see content that is out-and-out misogynistic, you just kind of roll your eyes and move on. 

But there is something particularly interesting about this video in particular. As I said, so many women have said to me, ""I don't know, it's just creepy, do you think it's creepy?"" For me, I suppose because, aptly, it addresses the blurred lines between sexual assertion and creepiness (pretty much what you'll see in any Reddit thread about Red Pill theory, outside TRP and seddit). 

The fact that we are at this point - that a video that isn't outrageously revolting can be a central part of public discourse about the representation of gender - is interesting and fantastic. Five years ago, public discourse about this video and song would have been dismissed as feminazis getting their knickers in a knot (and in some places I'm sure it still is). But the fact that we can talk about the nuance and subtleties of these things, identifying how certain representations of gender and sexuality can be problematic, is great. More often than not, things aren't good or bad, so having a more detailed discussions about the grey areas is important too I think."

But after Warner retired, he never got the QB position fixed. He signed a free agent, who did nothing. Had decently placed  draft picks, and that didn't get them anyone (in the 2011 draft, he passed on Locker, Dalton, Kaepernick, I may even throw Ponder in there). Gave up a 2nd round pick and a pro-bowl corner in a trade, and that was a bust. The position just never panned out, and severly hurt the team.

Sure, his teams were tremendously hurt by not having a good QB, but that's something he should had fixed, but never did. He's doing good in SD, but Rivers always had alot of talent and I'm not sure if how much that lies on McCoy (Peytons OC in Den last year) over Wisenhunt.

When my mum found out when I was 11 there was a period of ~5 years when I was 11-16 where every night was some kind of argument (pretty typically started by him..) There have been physical encounters between my dad and I too, but it has never been me acting out against him. Either he was unhappy with something I did at school, I wasn't playing soccer well enough or I was standing up for my sister or my mum when he would be yelling at them. Once he pinned me down on a bed and threw me at a wall..

It's made me a very quiet guy, shy, but actually pretty out-going with friends once we get to know each other. I really dislike conflict and I will do anything and everything in my power to make people happy. I love seeing people smile. It just makes my day when something I was a part of helped someone else. In the end...I think it may have actually made me a better person. I see all the things he's said and done to me and my mum and sister and am very conscious about making the same mistakes with those in my life. 

It's also deeply effected my view on relationships...I really dislike one night stands and random hook ups. I love the idea of having someone close who you can be very personal with, but I have a very hard time actually meeting girls. I like relationships, and I can honestly say I can just never cheat on a girlfriend. I just cant after seeing what it did to my mum.

Now we have a pretty professional relationship..talking about work when I see him. For some reason my family sweeps our past under the metaphorical rug and just lives in the moment. But I remember the things he's said and done, and I definitely have learned from them. I've pretty much given up trying to fix myself and my problems haha..I much prefer being involved with my friends and helping them. It helps me forget how I feel about myself."

ernestborgnine2013,AskWomen,1388998090.0,"Yes. I tried group therapy first, and I don't remember anything about it. I was in my late teens. I thought I was depressed but it was nothing like what you described. I had a lot of suppressed anger I think. Group therapy was a free medical service is how I remember it.

Second time was about 10 years later. That time I wasn't depressed but I was stuck in a rut in my life and having big difficulties in my relationships. The therapist was a friend of mine's mom. It worked out well. She got me to come often (at least once a week). She said it would go faster if I came to see her more often. And it did. I changed my life soon after. She helped me quit my job and deal with some relationship stuff. Eventually I got angry with her and stopped going, but I read this is natural. When you first go to therapy, you need help, but once that help is given, you reach a stage where you want to regain ownership over your thoughts and plans. You don't need that other person's input anymore. That's how I knew I should stop going. She didn't push for more sessions either, though I don't really remember what we said at the end. Point is, going to therapy doesn't mean you are going there for years and years.

By the way, I was very ready for therapy the second time. I knew I needed help.

Hope this helps you."

BuildMyPaperHeart,Warframe,1388998254.0,"&gt; The description on the wiki makes it seem that it cycles through the last 20 enemies I killed.

If I killed a Heavy Gunner on top of those 20 dead Grineer, will Shadows of the Dead spawn the Bombard or Heavy Gunner? The wording of 'last 20' is a bit confusing to me.

The last 20 refers to the last 20 you've killed from your most recent kill. Fairly simple. In your example, once you've killed the Heavy Gunner, then you would spawn the 19 Lancers and a Heavy Gunner. The Bombard was your 1st kill, but you spawn the *most recent* 20 kills, and you have 21 kills. So the Bombard is out.

TL;DR: The list starts from the end (most recent kill) when spawning enemies with SotD"

kicker7955,changemyview,1388998429.0,"&gt;One does not simply rebuild their belief system , i cant just forget this and the way it makes me feel. 

precisely you don't forget, you deconstruct and rebuild on solid foundations.

Theism is very accessible, that is why you where drawn to it. Start by judging every aspect in which you currently believe there is a form of interventionism(everyday life stuff, metaphysics don't matter and don't conflict with regular existence). experiment with it, turn whatever causality you think there is on its head and analyse the results.

In parallel I would recommend reading some philosophy(start no early than Hume and Descartes, try to find modern day books on them for ease of reading and a concentration on method rather than ideas),  to see how ""the pros"" approach intangible issues. 

Aproach everyday reality with naivete and build upon it, construct you model by deduction, from specific to general:

*A;B are ideas
1,2,3 are real life events.*


 If 1 and 2 happen then a and b are true and x'z is still unproven, 

never try: I believe Z what case from 5 to 34 prove me right.

again this is what pertains to real life, you don't touch the metaphysics, only limit its involvement if you come across the proper examples.

Never be certain, embrace surprises, sometimes 1,2 and 3 happen at the same time this makes x plausible, but x'z still unproven. 

I would say you're not a nihilist(you can't really be one if you have a theist belief system(at least i can't possibly imagine it), its like mountenbiking with training wheels, something is going to break), at best your theism is being poisoned by existentialism(it shall pass when you're to busy to think about it, but will resurface in your 30's).

 If it makes you feel better you where never invincible, you where just shielded from emptiness and futility, and this means your parents did a decent job.

P.S. when it comes to mental sanity people don't have good judgement. existentialism is like the flu it's easy to catch and most people have a weak immune system because of their sheltered upbringing. So if you sneeze people will mislabel you, try alternative medicines or even quarantine you for fear of contagion."

mukhabar,Israel,1388998466.0,"You're resorting to a Revisionist version of Israeli history. Whether or not the motives exist (they're irrelevant), it is impossible to deny that Israel succeeded in executing Plan Dalet and ethnically cleansing the Palestinian majority from the lands given to them by the partition plan. 700,000 people lost their homes, and you're going to blame every last one of those losses on the people who were ostensibly fighting for them to keep those homes, rather than the people who were trying to capture them? You cannot ""logic"" your way in to the idea that the Israelis would have happily accepted being a minority in charge of their own state when Herzl knew and warned that such a state of affairs would severely undermine Israel's stability and longevity. Your idea that Herzl's contemporaries did not consider the massive body of work on the matter of ""transfer"" during the formation of Israel (while simultaneously exalting him as their progenitor, no less) is attributing to them such an extreme degree of naivete that it would only reasonably follow that the Israelis were too stupid to achieve as lofty a goal as building an entire nation from scratch.  
  
The lands given to the Jewish minority of mandatory Palestine were roughly 70% Arab in 1947. That's quite a bit more than the 20% today, so yes, the ethnic cleansing was at least partially successful. Despite the fact that the Jews owned only 7% of the land in mandatory Palestine, 56% of it was allocated to them, including the most fertile parts of the country in the north, along the coast, and surrounding Lake Tiberias, as well as major Arab population centers like Haifa and Jaffa. The tired old slogan that ""The Jews graciously accepted it, the Arabs rejected it, it's the Arabs' fault"" does not take that majority into account. If a bunch of foreign diplomats ten worlds removed from your homeland declared that you would have to give half of it up to a minority population of mostly recent and illegal immigrants, in a deal that was so clearly stacked in their favor as detailed above, would you not reject that as well? Your hasbara slogan further suffers from a historical bias wherein you can look back already knowing what happened and say what a bad decision it was to fight a superior force that would have gladly taken less from them, if only they had surrendered without a fight.  
  
I really don't want to have to deal with common talking points like these at anymore, I've had this particular discussion a hundred times. You probably won't believe me no matter what I show you because points revolving around a dead generation's intentions or lack thereof are based in emotional reasoning that compels you to assume the best of your kin.  
  
The rest of what you've wrote is once again just apologism, seeking to make excuses for the deplorable state of race relations in Israel. The observable realities of being a Palestinian inside Israel or under Israeli military rule are not made better by the claims that some Arabs are treated better than others, that Arabs are made complicit in their own disenfranchisement, that some Israelis don't support racism, or that they all deserve it because some commit violent acts against their rulers. None of that really changes the fact that race-based collective punishment is written into modern IDF policy. The loyalty oath and modern transfer initiatives may not have succeeded, but they exemplify the atmosphere of fear and hatred projected towards Palestinians in Israel."

As someone who needs quiet rather than loud stimulation, NYC just drove me insane - sure, it was cool to live in the city and do fun city things, but it was impossible to have a nice quiet day out. (Also, NYC is kinda... gross. At some point I got habituated and was able to wear flip flops when it was warm, but now I don't think I can do it.) It's a fun place to visit, but being too cramped (both in terms of physical and mental space) really did me in.

CaptainBlicero,psychology,1388998653.0,"Would you feel confident in saying the same about Asperger's or OCD and why or why not? Also, what kind of frame of mind should someone with ADD have?

 I'm sorry but it is a very ignorant thing to say that someone with any mental illness can just simply change their frame of mind. It simply does not work that way. The symptoms people with ADD have are largely due to the low amounts of dopamine and possibly other neurotransmitters responsible for reward. The perceived laziness and inability to focus is because there is no dopamine to serve as an incentive to do things that are not interesting or stimulating. This is how stimulants work. They block dopamine re-uptake pumps which allow dopamine to accumulate in the synapse. People with ADD can focus just fine in things that are interesting to them which often leads them to hyper focus. Anyone proficient in the workings of the brain can tell you that this is typical of people that suffer from damage to the prefrontal cortex. There are a multitude of other symptoms that vary from minor things such as being stubborn and loquacious to more severe things such as suffering from depression and anxiety. No matter how hard many have tried they cannot just rid of their ADD by forcing themselves to change their frame of mind. That's like telling someone in a wheelchair to change his outlook on life and simply start walking. It is ridiculous. 

The more people take mental health as seriously as they do with conditions affecting other parts of the body, the better and easier it'll be for people who suffer from mental illnesses to progress further in society. "

People tell me, ""Oh, just take a 20 minute nap!"" like I can just fall asleep just like that and wake up 20 minutes when my alarm goes off. It takes me normally around 40 minutes for me to actually fall asleep, though sometimes it takes 15 and sometimes it takes an hour. How do you plan for a 20 minute nap around that? 

And it *sucks* because sometimes you're just dead-dog tired at 4pm and you know you don't have anything else to do for a while, but you know if you try to nap you'll be useless for the rest of the day but it's far too early to go to bed.

&gt;Are there any fields that need a bit more workers? 

Well... 250000 jobless, 50000 open jobs in general. Jobs in high demand are engineering, informatics, nurses.

&gt;How are EU citizens treated when it comes to jobs? Anything else that is important and needs to be addressed?

The job market in Belgium regrettably is still very informal. 2/3 of people are recruited through their network of acquaintances.

In the north Dutch, in the South French, in Brussels both. English will be sufficient to get started in the north and Brussels, can be trickier in the south.

&gt;Do most people ride bicycles, drive cars or use public transportation?

While people here complain about the public transportation, I've heard foreigners characterize it as very good.

SublethalDose,aspergers,1388999402.0,"&gt; Why do NTs consistently put up with people who are so horrible, just because they are family?

The goal in managing relations with horrible people is to minimize the total amount of horribleness.  NTs do consider the full gamut of options for dealing with relatives.  Read some advice columns and you'll see discussions about whether to cut people off, how to keep people at arm's length, and how complicated it is to try to exclude unpleasant relatives from a wedding.  Typically, not everyone in the family agrees on who is horrible and how horrible they are, so if you try to exclude the horrible people entirely or be horrible back to them, suddenly you have a lot more people being horrible to you than you originally did.  

&gt; But yet, it seems, that Im supposed to love these people anyways. 

Loving people is a religious obligation for some, but the only social obligation is civility.  Just remember that civility is not a denial of hostile feelings and judgments.  If you are gracious and civil to someone, people will not assume that you like and approve of that person.  They will just assume you are a gracious and civil person.

&gt; Also why is it that NTs are so concearned with appearences and hygiene? 

That's a question for anthropologists and psychologists.  I'm sure you can find plenty to read about the question, but I don't think that's really the question you want answered.  

&gt; I'd ask them why, but they'd just expect me to know why, like Im an NT.

It's because they do not think about why.  Why people care has no practical importance.  The fact that they do care has immense practical importance.  If it didn't, you wouldn't be here asking about it.  I know, it's not a very satisfying answer.  If you really want to change a custom, unfortunately, you have to prove yourself a master of it first.  Make yourself into a dandy, use skin cream, condition your hair, and *then* people will eat it up when you preach the benefits of taking  *sans douche* days.  No, I am not making that up.

Shalaiyn,wow,1389000427.0,"I'm one of the highest ranked arcane mages going by proraiders.com (FrontPage arcane) and this is my rule of thumb:

Immerseus: Mage armour with living bomb, frost armour feasible on normal

Protectors: Mage armour with nether tempest

Norushen: MA with LB

Sha of Pride: MA with LB; frost armour feasible on 25 man normal

Galakras: MA, bomb is a choice: LB for better boss damage, NT to pad on adds. You could switch to FA when boss lands and all trash is dead.

Juggernaut: FA with LB

Shamans: MA with NT, MA with LB on separate-HC-tanking strat.

Nazgrim: MA with LB

Malkorok: FA with LB on normal, either armour works on HC

Spoils: MA with NT, obviously

Thok: FA with LB, you can choose to go MA with bats on HC but you really need the 7% haste to splice in casts without meta gem proc at high shout stacks. I personally don't see room for glyph of armours and stick to FA though, bats are not an issue.

Siege: MA or FA with LB, MA if you let mines spawn on HC

Klaxxi: this is the funny bit, MA with LB/NT. Both will produce the same single target DPS ultimately (with NT winning out with good RNG) but using NT will probably incur shit from fellow raiders since it looks like you're padding, however: NT will work as if you have two bombs on one target when three are together - and more importantly, you can fish for arcane missiles procs by applying NT to the other two bosses which will lead to overall higher effective single rather DPS, ESPECIALLY if you don't use the 4set (though this is choice-driven).

Garrosh: MA with LB, switch to FA for HC p4.

tl;dr: Mage armour will win out once there's more than one target out for an extended period of time. That being said, the difference is ultra-minimal and you're looking at a difference of 0.5% DPS (which admittedly is still 1.5-2k DPs) on single target fights. 

FA is more forgiving if you fuck up your rotation.

ZeamiEnnosuke,AskReddit,1389000675.0,"I don't have anything against the Israeli people. I think they just want what everybody else want peace and safety. However I don't like the way their government wants to achieve it and I think that there are powers in the government who don't even want peace, because they would loose their power.

The settlements for example are something that needs to be stopped and for what an agreement needs to be found. Taking the land forcefully because they have the military power to do so is not right. Never was and never will.

I also think that there are people in Israel who are fascists and sadly I think a few of them are in positions of power. That's something that needs to be cleared.

From what I see and hear about Israel it currently seems like they are war raging and they want it to escalate, because they would most likely win the war and thus get rid of their problem once for all (at least that's what they think I assume).

I've never seen a reason for a Jewish state. Yeah sure there was a Jewish/Israeli nation back a few hundreds or thousands of years, but that does not mean that there is a need for a new state. In addition I don't think there should be any state around which takes part of it definition from religion. Another point is that I often here that the Nazis killed many Israelis, but, in my opinion, that's not true. The Jews killed by the Nazis were Polish, French, Austrian, Belgian, Dutch or German for the most part. They were Jews sure, that's true, but that doesn't make them Israeli.

All in all I think the situation needs to be cleared and only Israel has the power to do so, but it doesn't look like it will be cleared any time soon. I just hope that we don't see a war.

mundabit,birthcontrol,1389000974.0,"Ok, let me start by saying that after reading this, your chance of pregnancy is so low, I was beginning to think you were a troll.

Nexplanon is effective immediately provided you have not ovulated or started ovulating, this is normally guaranteed by having nexplanon inserted while on your period. But don't fret, just because you weren't exactlt on your period doesn't mean its not effective. The IUD and the pill will of prevented ovulation right up to the point you got the Implant, at which time the implant would take effect.

Now, precum very rarely contains live sperm, if a man has urinated that day prior to releasing precum, it wont contain sperm. on top of that, sperm can not survive outside the body more than 2 hours without proper cryogenic refrigeration, once sperm dries it is dead, and drying can occur sooner than 2 hours. Sperm needs a medium to swim through for the entire leg of its journey from male urethra to the egg, it would of been a very rough journey for any sperm to travel through layers of fabric, into the vaginal entrance, through the canal, into the cervix, through the womb (that may of still been hostile due to the only recent removal of the IUD) and into the fallopian tubes to find an egg that probably isn't even there.

**Your implant is effective and has been effective since the day it went in due to your circumstances involving the pill and IUD.**

**The sexual act you are concerned about rarely results in pregnancy even in women who are not using birth control.**

Nexplanon sounds like a very good method for you considering it will be much less hassle than your pill, and hopefully you will preffer it to your IUD."

You can get an IUD as long as you are old enough to menstruate. My GYN was suggesting mirena to me when I was 12. I eventually got it at 15. some GYN's take issue with it as nulliparous women tend to expell them more often or have pain-related side effects. But age itself is not a big enough factor to deny someone birthcontrol that will suit their lifestyle.

If anything IUDs, Implants and so on are better than pills when it comes to young people, once its in and taken effect, its near-impossible to fall pregnant based on user-error. If you are naive when it comes to sex, a fool-proof Implant is exactly what you need. well, Primarily you need education on fertility and the human body, but failing that, and implant works too."

But even if that is true, it's not like this woman is cheating the system or is getting something she shouldn't by taking advantage of this scheme (I'm assuming she has actually bought the flat and the whole thing isn't a set up). The scheme is open to anyone, regardless of income. You, me or a female estate agent from Southampton can all apply to buy a house using it, however much we earn.

The Tory PR team should have chosen someone who doesn't work in the property industry, because it all smells fishier than it probably is. Estate agents buy properties for themselves through their own agencies all the time for obvious reasons - they see them first and they can negotiate with the buyer without anyone else putting in offers. As long as they disclose to the seller that they work for the estate agency that the seller has engaged (this is usually pretty obvious), they haven't broken any rules. It's up to the seller whether they accept that person's offer or whether they want to market it publicly.

If the woman had worked for a bank, or a chain of hairdressers, or a local authority etc, this would be a non-story. It is a non-story. And I say that as someone who can't stand Cameron or the Tories."

IndieLady,videos,1389001737.0,"I understand that and can certainly see why that's how many people interpret it. 

But to me, it's just a kind of tricky area, and one that can be very problematic. As I said, I don't think it's an issue of consent, I think it's about a man telling a woman what she wants, and personally I find that a little creepy. 

I can't speak for other women but there is something that makes me intrinsically uncomfortable about a man telling me ""you know you want it"" and encouraging me to be sexual. I've had dudes tell me ""I want it"" and I definitely didn't. Perhaps something old-fashioned about the entire concept, that I'm some blushing coquette that needs permission, or encouragement, to get it on. 

Maybe because there were so many threads about it in the last few days so I've got it on my mind, but there has recently been so much discussion on Reddit about theredpill and if men should push women's boundaries, to get them to ""give in"". This song reminds me of that. To me, it just feels a little unhealthy.

I would love to hear what other Redditors think, do they need men to encourage them to act on their sexual desires? Do they feel they should be seem mellow and tame about sex? Or do they feel comfortable expressing it? It just seems very outdated."

That pretty much sums up my performance in primary school. It was my protest against the fact that no teacher had ever provided me with work that was worth doing. Kind of ironic, since that is also the author's main point. Instead, I chose to spend my time in class reading books that were waaaaaay above my grade level. Every once in awhile I'd write an A essay or do some math problems or fill in a lab report. 

&gt;The attention is turned on me, the teacher, who is criticized, evaluated, and penalized for the fleeting wills of adolescents.

I wouldn't say it was a fleeting protest, though, since I'd been doing it from the first grade through sophomore year when I finally was allowed to leave high school.

The ideal feminine is much more unforgiving than the ideal masculine: if you're a dude, so long as you eat right and have something resembling developed musculature, you'll be considered attractive enough in the body department, and I think it's reflected in most masculine looks-related goals.  

If you're female, though, you're all wrapped up in filling this weird contradictory set of physical expectations that aren't even achievable for most people.  Your butt has to be well-developed but not too muscular, your thighs can't touch, your tits have to be the 'right' size and self-supporting, your stomach has to be perfectly flat, but without defined abs, and your arms can't be 'too masculine'.  I think a lot of women go into dieting thinking that they'll end up looking like a VS model at the end of it, and then end up beating themselves up and falling off the wagon when such things don't happen, because VS models are extreme outliers.

carmensiandiego,travel,1389002193.0,From what I can see on those two links is that the top prices are for completely different routings and airlines so you will likely get very different prices.

I had to email them for a few requests and got a response within 24 hours so you could definitely try contacting them if you're not sure. There shouldn't really be a mistake with their pricing though so I wouldn't feel that risky buying it. Otherwise find a local travel agent who offers pricing beating and take that in to them or the airline should be able to book it for you over the phone.

prarastas,AskReddit,1389002326.0,"Perhaps I can draw a comparison: it's very similar to the [Scared-Straight problem](https://www.ncjrs.gov/html/ojjdp/news_at_glance/234084/topstory.html). I'll sum up the article here but there are linked studies attached to the page I've linked: Scared Straight programs have actually been shown to have a negative effect, in that crime rates increase after the program.

The only thing that's changed when they leave the program is the fact that they went through the program, and other people know they went through the program. This leads to Scared Straight kids acting extra tough or performing more illegal acts in an effort to impress their friends and demonstrate that the program didn't change them. Also, as suggested by [Psychology Today](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/redirect/201203/scared-crooked) (you can take this at whatever value you wish, I'm citing it primarily for a single quote), it also can be what I call the ""don't touch the stove"" effect. If you keep warning someone about how dangerous or bad something is, they're eventually going to want to see for themselves, and do the drugs, join the gangs, commit the crimes, etc.

I think it's the same with DARE. The kids are taught so much about how bad the drugs are, and nothing educational or objective about the drugs themselves. They're bound to be curious and since DARE isn't answering those curiosities, they're going to try and learn through experience. On top of that, they're probably more likely to try the drugs they were DAREd not to do because it'll make them look high school cool to their friends -- *see, guys?! DARE can't change me, I'm still hard, #YOLO #420blazeit*"

Prohibition of alcohol in the US in the 20's led to massive amounts of organised crime (Al Capone et al) 

Prohibition of Cocaine, Heroine, Marijuana ect have led to massive cartels that are too powerful to fight without an all out war. 

If drugs were decriminalised, produced properly and distributed responsibility the benefits would be monumental. The money made from tax is an argument by itself. 

The ""war on drugs"" has shown that no matter how illegal something is, people will still use it, so why not make money off of their bad decisions?

By nature, philosophy is going to look deeper into what many consider mundane matters. So in society, philosophical discussion is always going to be an outlier. So don't pose this as a means to change how this board is perceived (idle musings aside), just pose questions for those interested and the pureness of philosophical debate, inquiry, and advancement of ideas."

dHUMANb,summonerschool,1389002623.0,"Renekton is naturally a bully at early levels. Rengar has better sustain than him though so just keep tossing out snares to mess with his last hitting while avoiding his bread and butter combos and his Q poke. Any time he uses his abilities on minions is an opportunity to jump on him for a quick trade. If he always saves his abilities then that's good for you because it means you can both free farm and you'll just scale better than him.

You have to learn each top champion's power spikes and work around them. Riven and Garen for example, are stronger than almost anybody at lvl2. Their QE combos are so strong. So either bait out their cds and then go back in, or just don't trade til later levels. Renek lvl3? Don't stand near your minions or he'll land his whole combo on you with E&gt;AA&gt;W&gt;AA&gt;Q&gt;AA&gt;E away. Darius lvl3 is going to try to hook you and land an AA&gt;W&gt;Q and let the bleed do the work.

Another huge thing people always forget is minion damage. Don't fight for too long if their wave is larger than yours. Also don't fight in the middle of their minion wave, because then their melee and caster minions will be hitting you while only your caster minions will hit him. Always try and drag the duel back towards your wave. Singed is actually deceptively good at that with his fling.

Very rarely will you ever want to duel face to face. You almost always want to wait until a valuable cooldown is wasted on their side. Also, even if they're stronger they can't fight you if they're low health. Dueling is only half the battle in top lane."

The other angle I'd have for this is that you visit him at various points in his life.  Maybe something happens and he rejects you completely, and you aren't able to ""return"" to his life until a few years later when he's at a low-point psychologically.  Maybe he's started a family while you were 'away"" but things are starting to unravel... and suddenly you appear in his life again, beginning to take control.

Science shows us how reality works, but it doesn't necessarily provide the emotional/intellectual tools that the average, nonscientific person needs to ""live **in** reality"". Religion is one of the many things that can. 

One of Nietzsche's aphorisms is relevant (paraphrasing from memory): *what good does it do the drowning man to know that the chemical composition of water is H2O?*

Religion doesn't teach us about how reality works, but it does provide a lot of people with the tools they need to live in reality.

Soogoodok248,AskReddit,1389003217.0,"To clarify further, Tylenol+opiates is bad over the long term as it causes major liver damage. This ends in a slow, painful death that takes place over many months/years.

Opiates on the other hand, especially when potentiated (made more accessible by the brain) with things like grapefruit juice, promethazine, nicotine, or antihistamines, have a tendency to slow breathing. Alcohol slows breathing on its own as well, but to a lesser extent. Antihitstamines have a multiplicative effect on the strength of opiates, and alcohol has an additive one due to how each affects brain chemistry. When all of these effects are combined, we see things like people asphyxiating in their sleep.

woensdag333,AskWomen,1389003297.0,"To start a conversation in Dutch with a stranger it is pretty smart to be polite. 

In Dutch we use ""u"" to indicate a person politely, and ""uw"" is a possession of them, for example: ""Bent u Mr. de Vries? Uw auto is gestolen."" = ""Are you Mr. de Vries? Your car has been stolen.""

And the informal way is ""jij"" to indicate someone, and ""jouw"" or ""je"" is their possession, for example: ""Jij bent toch gevallen met de fiets? Hoe is het met je knie?"" = *You fell from your bike, didn't you? How is your knee?""

So a basic conversation with a friend could go like:

* Person 1: ""Hey Laura""
* Person 2: ""Hoi Eline."" (Hoi, Hallo and Hey can be used as a greeting.)
* P1: ""Hoe gaat het (met je)?"" (How are you?)
* P2: ""Ja alles gaat goed, met jou dan?"" (I'm fine, what about you?""
* P1: ""Ook alles goed. Heb je nog wat beleefd?"" (I'm fine too. Have you done anything fun recently?)

Teaching abroad is great for the recent college graduate or recently retired empty-nester wanting experience and adventure, but hardly an option for a struggling single parent."
flashmedallion,Gaming4Gamers,1389003313.0,"Take it to a further level - you design your blades visually.  A novice Smith is able to add one vertex to the lowest grade of steel - basically a stick.  As you improve your skill, you'll be able to make more vertices - once you're at three you'll therefore be able to add a ""point"" to the end of your weapon.

The shape of the weapon is used to procedurally create its stats - so you can play with weight, balance, damage etc. as you are able to make more complicated designs.  The area of the weapon determines the amount of resources needed to craft.  

The number of vertices you can add is a function of your skill and the alloy you are smithing with.  So you might be at the point where you can add four vertices to a bronze blade, but only one to iron.  

All of this is handled procedurally.  Hell, as a Smith you could make your own alloys - ten percent of this, twenty percent of that - the final composition determines the base stats for the material as well as its ""difficulty"", which is calculated against your Forging skill to determine how many vertices you can create.  

As your Smithing increases, your precision of alloying increases - originally you can only use increments of 100% for Bronze, but at higher levels you can eventually use 10% increments of bronze, 20% increments of iron, and 50% increments of titanium (or fantasy equivalent), for example.

Full creative, procedural generation of your weapons.  You could stick to making blunt weapons and focus on mastering the heaviest and softest materials (lead) , or gain finesse with lighter, harder materials (refined or folded steels) eventually making a trident or anything you can think of, and the procedural system generates stats appropriate to the materials and shape.

You're always able to make simple weapons at the top of your skill range for a steel, and as your skills improve you are able to make more and more intricate (specialised) weapons with less powerful steel.

A similar logic could apply to ""drawing"" runes as an enchanter."

ohgeronimo,Buddhism,1389003322.0,"Potential being is probably the best way I could describe it. It's the other side of the being, the part that I'm ignorant of when attempting to describe it. It is that it is in just the same way that being is that it is. Anytime you try to nail it down you feel like you're on the edge of knowing, but knowing is simultaneous with being. Well, that is if you're trying to know it via concepts, as something distinct and not that.

Like planting seeds, when they sprout you see what has been sown. Or you dig them up, but ya do that and then you've got a chance of missing your planting window and they go bad and boom no nice corn to munch on. Priorities, ya know? But how do you see the potential being of the seed without knowing the being of the sprout or being of the seed as is? And how do you see it without seeing it as anything other than that which by definition would make it part of that which is in entirety that. So it's nothing. But it's that too. But it is nothing. And that's the closest concept I can think of without being too false to imply the truth from. You kind of need to just observe and find out."

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1389004090.0,"**Why men can be studs, and women shouldn’t**

Let’s first look at what drives a man and a woman towards sex: To attract a woman, you need to seduce her. To seduce her you have to ignite her emotions -- she needs the full package. When a woman goes home with a guy for a one night stand, it’s entirely different than why a man would. The guy doesn’t necessarily need to be LTR material, but he needs to turn her on. That requires a degree of confidence, mystery, suave, humor, and masculinity. It requires a full package. This is why you don’t see many female 7s running around having one night stands with guys with a lower SMV. Guys with a lower SMV simply aren’t capable of igniting her emotions. It just can’t happen, especially when there are other men of higher SMV that can. Why choose the lower guy when she is really turned on by the other guy? Afterall, you aren’t seeing hotties taking home a good looking guy that’s boring, annoying, nervous, and just generally beta. No, she’s looking for the alpha cock to run off with that turns her emotions on.

Then there are men. It’s a little different as you can imagine. For the most part, we don’t need her ignite our emotions, we need her to ignite our dick, and you know what that takes? Being hot and manageable to be around. We don’t have high standards. We just want to fuck something that looks good. How many times have you been drunk and thought, “Uggg this chick is annoying, obnoxious, boring, annoying, and stupid, but she’s cute.” And then not opt to go fuck her if you can? I’m guessing it’s not that often. If it’s just a one night stand, you don’t need her riviting personality to give you a boner, just a cute ass and pretty smile. 

Investment: 

Much of the reasoning behind this is completely bio, it roots from our primal brains. Women, to remain successful MUST be highly selective of their mates. They need to be picky. They can’t just have some loser beta boy knocking her up and expect him to help provide and protect her. No, she always has to be seeking high SMV men to ensure that her potential child will have a providing man around. On the flipside, men don’t have the responsibility of child birth. We don’t have to stick around. You can line 20 women up against the wall, and I can get every one of them pregnant that day, leave, and never have to deal with the consequences. So naturally, as a man, I don’t have to be too picky with who I fuck. So it makes sense that I can fuck down on the SMV. Meanwhile, line 20 men up against the wall, that woman can fuck every single one of them that day, but only get pregnant once. It makes sense that she should want the highest SMV guy to be the one that gets her pregnant. The consequences of sex between the genders are vastly different.

If a woman simply sleeps with whomever comes around. What does that say about her character? She’s risky, she’s unloyal, she doesn’t value her treasure. To her she’s willing to fuck the first guy that makes her tingle without even considering the ramifications. She’s a hedonist, just looking for pleasure, not concerned with the ramifications -- men don’t want this when looking for a long term partner. However, for a quick fuck, yes, that’s exactly what we want. But, again, we aren’t going to date you. We have the ability to get our dick wet and disappear. We’ll fuck you if we can, but don’t act shocked when I choose not to stick around.

IcarusCrashing,depression,1389004104.0,"I'm so weird. I crave compliments but I absolutely hate most of them. I guess I just like the ones that feel sincere. Hearing something nice can completely turn around someone's day. Because of this I try to give out genuine compliments all the time. Even though I gate them, it kind of crushes me that I give out sui many but rarely get any back.

As I said, I like compliments when they feel sincere and genuine, but my problem is that they rarely feel that way. Usually I feel like the person is being sarcastic and its some sick joke. The more specific the compliment is, the easier it is to handle. ""You look nice"" feels like the person is trying to rub in how shitty I look, and its too much for me. The person's actions after the compliment also impact how sincere I feel it is. For example, if you say ""you look nice, babe"" and then grab me and Kiss me, that's alot different than saying just saying ""you look nice"" and walking away. Also, I'd rather hear, "" I like that dress""  than ""that dress looks nice on you"" . To me it's just easier to handle because it's easier to believe.

 I want to get to a point where I can handle/believe compliments, but I don't really know how."

gualdhar,ffxiv,1389004162.0,"Something you need to remember is the mechanics of FFXI allowed for very specialized gear. People could make macros to change gear for each spell (and with the aid of Windower you could change your entire gear set). For example, as RDM I had sets for mnd/enfeebling, int/enfeebling, mnd/refresh, mnd/healing, int/elemental, and so on, and could switch to each elemental staff or a wand as appropriate, for each spell.

Here, gear can't be changed in combat. So of course they're going to go with more generalized stats. Why would it make sense to choose a piece of gear that's only useful for a small fraction of your abilities? Maybe eventually they'll throw in some useful additional effects that help all of your abilities, but you're not going to ever see FFXI levels of gear customization."

My typical day is pretty boring. I sit in front of my computer and work on the tickets assigned to me. Normally I have a fair amount of idle time, which is caused by compiling or trying to understand the code I or a coworker wrote a few days ago.

My crappiest day seems pretty boring, but when I sit there and am searching a bug for a few hours and can't find it, it bothers the hell out of me. I'm getting angry at the code and at everything. I start cursing and then I need to take a break from it otherwise I would punch somebody. After all it's still an boring day.

Do some degree yes, as a developer you have to be creative in someway. But more than that you have to be able to admit that you make mistakes. And you have to love it, even when it seems boring or annoying you have to love it, if you don't love don't even consider doing a job like this. Oh and also kiss goodbye to your own little projects most likely you won't touch them after work, because you can't stand the sight of code anymore ;)

TaylorS1986,science,1389004583.0,"The crazy thing is that there is not even consensus about which Mesozoic gymnosperm group flowering plants evolved from. One that I see suggested often is an obscure group of extinct broadleaved gymnosperms called the Caytoniales.

I suspect that angiosperms evolved in wet densely forested highlands in the southern hemisphere. Such an environment would be relatively lacking in wind in the forest understory (the earliest flowering plants were shrubs and small trees), necessitating novel methods of pollination, in the case of the earliest angiosperms that seems to have been beetles. Additionally, such an environment is not conductive to fossilization, which is why angiosperms seemed to appear suddenly without obvious antecedents."

I moved abroad and while I like my work friends, we just hang out at work. My friends from home have dwindled to 2, and we only speak about twice a year and meet up once or twice when I'm back on holidays. Aside from that, I hang out with my boyfriend and his friends, although he's got a lot of acquaintances rather than close friends so it's either not weird or it's weird for both of us. 

As for new friends I've tried meetups (the groups around here are really just one group of extremely boring, unhappy immigrants), the gym, language classes and language cafes. I'm going to carry on with the language cafes and try with a new hobby. 

A lot of the time I've felt like shit, if I'm honest. But part of the solution is to take the pressure off... don't focus on getting friends, focus on enjoying yourself. 

Exercise, even if alone, to get your mood up. Talk to anyone and everyone with the intention of making *their* day better, and that's it. Try new groups or hobbies to try new things and have fun, not to meet people.

silverionmox,PoliticalDiscussion,1389004634.0,"&gt; Wow, you really don't give a shit about anything other than putting your dick in a vagina, do you? How old are you?

Sexist.

&gt;Before we started going after men who just wanted to play, kids had it a lot fucking worse.

Men have always been held responsible with no appeal for children, and in a time when abortion was not an option that was entirely reasonable, because the same practice applied to women. Running away was their only option, and it still is: the current practice doesn't change that. It's not making a difference, and the links I supplied show that single parenthood, with or without child support, is bad in itself.

&gt;Yes, when we're talking about violent videogames. In this case, we're talking about you abandoning your children.

It's exactly the same: an appeal to emotion, used to shut down rationality. The fact that you've devolved into ad hominems, as if I'm on trial personally, just illustrates that.

&gt;You just want the same privileges as women, without ever taking the same risks.

No, the man would still not be able to choose parenthood, because it's not acceptable to force someone to give birth. He just gets the same right to opt out as the woman has, because it comes with a consequence for him: parenthood, which is a serious responsibility, whatever form it takes.

But I'm glad you at least recognize that the women do have privileges in this situation.

&gt;But, I'm not unreasonable. Tell me, what you think of this compromise? Every guy who wants a financial abortion must legally register their desire to avoid fatherhood in advance, and inform their partner before they have sex.

It gives support when contraception fails and the couple disagrees about what to do then, against previous agreements, that's good. I don't think the registration is strictly necessary: the usage of contraception can be considered a declaration of intent already, though when it becomes a problem you inevitably end up with a word against word situation, so it's certainly useful.

I'll throw in a few things too: the option should not be available for married couples. Declining parenthood should cost as much as an abortion, the proceeds of which could go to family planning campaigns, single parent support, lowering the price of abortion or similar goals.

I consider that a decent compromise."

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1389004815.0,"Both Enoch and Farage are clowns. People integrate and do so pretty well even from far places in the world. Obviously not all of them integrate fully but this is a place where government should simply do more. There can be hundreds of new things which could be introduced which would boost integration - most recent, obligatory ESOL course with citizenship test for some types of new British naturalisations (used to be ESOL with citizenship as enough).

Also, as Enoch was against any immigration Farage attacks mainly EU and its immigrants. It's well known that EU migrants have more in common with Britons and in general integrate even quicker and better than non-EU migrants.

Farage is a coward who rather than improve and change the system wants to simply abandon it. I wouldn't be surprised if he was to get death penalty to UK back (if UK were to quit EU that would be possible). As if someone is in jail, what's the point in an attempt to fix him, better get rid off him, right?

Red_White_and_Blonde,summonerschool,1389004819.0,"As you said, Thornmail specifically counters AD, but its passive seems a waste on ADC. Your job is sustained damage, and in all likelihood it's a high amount. Thornmail's unique passive isn't going to come close to your damage from autoattacks alone and while the high armor is nice, the other armor-heavy defensive item, Randuins, provides almost the same thing except tailored better for the role.

Randuins gives health and armor, both useful for AD heavy comps, but the health also gives an edge against AP which generally will be in your game. Yet the biggest thing Randuin has over Thornmail is the active. The passive is okay, but it's the AoE slow allowing you to kite incredibly well that makes it amazing. I think you get what you pay for in this case. You're a ranged AD Carry and positioning is one of your higher priorities. Randuin's Omen helps do that for you, and is also great against those AD heavy comps and then some.

I'll skip to writing about Guardian Angel next since you seem to dislike it. I also prefer not buying it because I hate planning on dying and having it take a spot when the res is actually down (I'm a Scimitar fan mostly, followed by Randuin's then Banshee's). However, sometimes I have to suck it up and admit that *I am going to die*. When the enemy team has multiple fed assassins with gap closers, or even mages, chances are you're dead even with your God mechanics. This is when a GA is literally a life saver. Once you're dead (it was inevitable, it's okay) the assassin is stuck in the thick of your team, and will allow you to come back into the fight slightly safer and with enough health and lifesteal to kill the now-weakened assassins.

Tl;dr, I don't like Thornmail."

I had hoped that the *molten gold poured all over the bloody dragon* would do something, at least make him fly lower so he's in the range of Bard's shooting or something. That's what I would have done.

Oh, and that bit when Thorin taunts Smaug to breathe fire into the forges? It was weird, they should have burned behind these iron bars anyway, just from the fire streaming past.

Or do they have her cast it immediately after the votes are counted? Would be interesting to see how they do that for TV. In any case, I REALLY wish they had kept it as a F3 because that jury vote would have been the craziest ever.

The bit about Ozzy is almost too good to be true. For anyone to come on Survivor and think that someone owes them an apology for playing the game is absurd. ""You put a price on our friendship"" -- as if anyone comes to play Survivor so that they can leave as a friend of Ozzy. "

Sure, they're aggressive and different this time, but where's the challenge in a police force that's easy to hide from? Your wanted level isn't even that hard to lose. Sure, the cops are quite a bit of a chore but that makes total sense.

&gt; 1.) They blast you to pieces after minor offences

They don't shoot you at *. They start shooting at ** when you try to evade arrest.

&gt; 2.) I'm not saying all of these should be fixed, but the spawning system is a mistake that was made at development.

Deal with it. The system the game is available on is 8 years old. Plus, you obviously haven't tried using a police cruiser to get up Mt. Chiliad. You should've showed up at the Rockstar North Studio and volunteered to re-do the code for the police AI if you think you can do a better job at it.

&gt; 3.) I NEVER EVER said they shouldn't use weapons. I said they should not use weapons after a small offence like car theft compared to murder where the same actions are done.

Car theft is a small offence? Where in the world do you live?

Sure, you get shot at. Who cares? You have weapons of your own. Retaliate!

&gt; 4.) Helicopters often spawn at one star. Go get in a police chase a couple times and watch the radar. So you're saying if I accidentally knock over a cop's coffee, I deserve a helicopter on me?

I have seen this happen. Helicopters show up on the radar if they are nearby but they won't go after you.

If you see a chopper nearby, why would you go in the direction of the chopper anyway?

&gt; 5.) No, I wouldn't like that. But they don't have to smash into every car ever and pulverize the streets to arrest me. Side swiping or violent tactics should be used after more serious levels like 3+

Again, go to Rockstar North and volunteer to do the coding. Now if you want the realism factor, collateral damage and civilian casualties are the major risks in a high-speed chase. Plus, they're lumps of pixels for crying out loud.

&gt; 6.) I have played and owned every Grand Theft Auto game since San Andreas

Then you should know better.

Secondly, one of the things that gets thrown around on MFA a lot is that fit is the most important thing. It's hard to judge what's good or bad in your wardrobe without seeing pictures of you in them. Post in the Simple Questions and Outfit Feedback threads to get some advice (look in the sidebar for when those happen).

That said, assuming that they all fit you fairly well, you've got some nice pieces. The shirts in 1 and 3 are all really usable. Some of the brighter polos/collared shirts/shorts are much harder to pull off for a beginner, though.

Again, fit is the most important thing. Look in the sidebar for the basics of a wardrobe, learn how they're supposed to fit, and start from there.

AnJu91,trees,1389005819.0,"Here's my 2 cents for what it's worth, please note I'm not judging or criticizing in any way, I'm an avid supporter of marijuana becoming normalized in our society, but it has to be done properly:
 
Marijuana is a great drug with many benefits due to its psychoactive properties, but the same psychoactive properties also have side effects.
 
I'm very glad to hear you've been able to balance out your usage and integrate it into a healthy lifestyle, but I want to emphasize that marijuana on your age is something you should *seriously* be cautious with. I'm not saying this because some people see it as some gateway drug, but because your brain is in a very sensitive phase in life, and any psychoactive substances might cause your brain to develop suboptimally.
 
The exact mechanics of marijuana's psychoactive constituents aren't fully known yet, but the fact that one should be cautious with psychoactive substances during this *crucial* time for the brain holds in general. Therefore some headers:
 
* Remember that the benefits of marijuana only hold when you use it in moderation. More marijuana isn't better, the substance isn't inherently positive, it's simply a tool that greatly aids mental (and physical) health if used sensibly. Be strict with yourself when it comes to usage and habit.
 
* Don't make it too normal, don't smoke it too casually, never forget that it *is* a psychoactive drug. The moment you notice a sense of dependency (like urges to blaze it up whenever bored, or finding the most stupid excuses to grant yourself a hit etc), remind yourself of the aforementioned things and ease down. 
 
* Don't associate your successes with marijuana, but your ability to use resources and create a healthy lifestyle. Marijuana can be part of your lifestyle, but it shouldn't be the center of it! This is what goes wrong with most of the bad apples in stoner community. They overpraise and overvalue marijuana as a response to the criticism and taboo of the general public, and think it's some wonder drug that inherently betters their life. It's just as stupid as people who overcelebrate drinking. 

Smoke sensibly, not just for yourself but also for the community and society, it will aid the integration of marijuana in society. We're on the verge of a revolution in drug policy, especially with marijuana, it's our responsibility to make sure this goes smoothly and adequately!"

They don't have to wrap things up really.


I love Sherlock, but to claim that it's basically 4.5 hours of top quality film every two years is really overselling, or underselling film-making as  a craft. Moffat and Gatiss are great, but they're not ""better than almost all screenwriters today"" great. "

DragonFireKai,TumblrInAction,1389006143.0,"BMI becomes increasingly inaccurate as height increases beyond the average, it's because BMI increases on a squared exponent with respect to height, whereas weight is more closely related to volume, which if you were to idealize a person as a cylinder, increases with a cubed exponent. So as you increase height, the gap between the weight required to maintain the same BMI as a shorter individual and the weight required to maintain the same proportions with respect to height, becomes more pronounced. 

For example, Yao Ming, who looked quite lean during his playing days in the NBA, weighed 310 lbs, borderline obese by BMI. This wasn't a case of ""muscle weighs more"" as is often cited when comparing the BMI of athletes with more traditional heights, it was simply a matter of the BMI formula breaking down. BMI is a bad measurement to use with anyone over 6'4"". It just gets more and more inaccurate."

So the focus of my family is practical: what needs to be done? When do the children need looking after? Do they need help with cooking, cleaning?  Then also, what procedures are ahead? What happens, what is the impact on my sister-in-law? How will she feel? What about work?

Personally I'm trying not to panic or cry about it. The tests have come back as best they could and really all you can do is hope for the best and keep your head down and do what you can to help. I don't want to be a distraction by getting all teary and upset, I just want to help."

ManInTheMirage,fatlogic,1389006537.0,"&gt; Many years ago, my school nurse told us a general rule about healthy weight; it's a simple formula: If you are 5 foot tall, start with a hundred pounds, then for every inch past that, add 5 pounds, then give or take five pounds, and that's your healthy weight estimate.
So, if you were 5 foot 5 inches...you start with the hundred, then do 5 times 5 (25) and your healthy weight answer is 125, give or take 5 pounds, meaning, anywhere between 120 and 130.
I find it to be a simple, but very accurate little formula. Oh, and at the time (this was late Eighties) the modeling world used the same formula but with three pounds. So then, at 5'5'', the model would be 100 plus 3 times 5 inches= 115 give or take three pounds, so between 112 and 118.

Flex_Plexico,australia,1389006543.0,"your original question? I assume you mean:
&gt; So you believe that the life of an unborn child, outweighs the right to life of a woman who has already grown, had a taste of life, love and is a part of the fabric of human experience?

NO, i have already said in a different post (perhaps not to you) that in the event that the mother is at high risk of death or significant risk of harm, abortion is okay, but the thing about this issue is 100% of aborted foetuses die and only 7 in 100'000 women die during birth or in the following 42 days as a result of the birth (this is a figure for my specific country).

in response to whether my viewpoint should have any impact on what happens... I hold very dear the rights of others and i will defend the rights of others as long as i can because giving a shit is part of who i am, i am not ignoring the rights of the women and i would never condemn a person who sought an abortion, but somebody has to defend the rights of those children and it is (in my opinion) a bigger violation of someone's rights to be denied life than to have to put up with 9 months of a decreased quality of life...

so to summarise I AM staunchly opposed to abortion in most situations but it is not about ignoring the rights of the women, or being misogynistic. it is simply this, in such an unfortunate situation as one where an abortion is being considered SOMEBODY's rights are violated, either the mothers or the child's and you have to do a bit of a ramifications balance. the death is infinitely worse than 9+ months of emotional and physical stress... and as such in my view the baby gains priority unless the woman is faced with death or significant health ramifications moving beyond the pregnancy, only then does this carry heavier weight than the ramifications of the child's death.

and yes if I was to persecute you for a lifestyle choice then i would be in the wrong, the issue is that to me it's not a personal lifestyle choice it's not a question of women's rights it's about HUMAN RIGHTS and it's not just you, its the child also who has to be considered and given a voice..."

RaineyDays,AskWomen,1389006559.0,"It can be good to see a therapist, but you have to be comfortable with them for it to work. If you don't feel completely comfortable and able to open up for any reason then don't be afraid to find another, because it just won't get you the results you're looking for.

I saw 4 different therapists over a 3 year period. The first one, I went to my GP and told him how I was feeling and he referred me to the local unit. The woman I ended up seeing reminded me of my mum though, and it was just too hard to really open up to her so I ended it.

After that I spoke to someone at school and they referred me to someone else at a different unit. She was really good. Someone to talk to about stuff, but also worked on lots of coping strategies for when I wasn't seeing her. However, the whole unit she worked out of was only intended to be short term help, so she in turn referred me to two other therapists. Liked one, wasn't too keen on the other.

It can work, but you also have to be willing to out in the effort to make it work as well."

ctesibius,Fixxit,1389006913.0,"I've just got a bike back on the road after 11 years under a cover out of doors. 5 years in a garage shouldn't be a problem. However if you are doing it for sale, don't over-do the work. You need it running and road legal, not more than that. So for example the chain is probably rusty. Clean it and grease it, but unless it's dangerous, don't replace it. Probably no need to change the oil either, just take it out for a good run to get the condensed water out of it.

Main points: 

* Drain the tank and carb. If you didn't turn the petrol tap off, you're probably going to have to clean the carb and it's probably worth replacing the pilot jet as it's small and tends to gum up easily. It's cheap.
* New battery - the old one will certainly be dead. Charge it, then try to start the bike.
* Check for corrosion damage on the forks and chain. Rust on the chain will cause it to wear faster, but unless the links are corroded to the point where they won't flex, or the chain is just worn too much, it doesn't require an immediate replacement. 
* Fork pitting is more serious and fixing it will really impact your profit margin. The only permanent fix is to replace the stanchions (the chromed tubes). Some people have tried filling the pits with a tiny amount of epoxy glue (e.g. Araldite), letting it set for 48h and then smoothing it with fine emery paper. This can work for a while, but the problem will recur. Also there is a risk that the epoxy is not completely set, and gums up your suspension the first time you ride the bike."

Berean_Katz,DebateAChristian,1389006934.0,"In two words: it doesn't.
The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is a failure on God's part, because he can't stand the sight of sin and yet he still thinks it's a good idea to create a tree that would essentially cause original sin to exist.
   
Another failure on God's part is the fact that he is omniscient and yet he fails to predict that Adam and Eve would disobey him. True, the disobedience could've been anything God wanted it to be (thou shalt not eat dinosaurs), but regardless of *what* the disobedient action was, God should have seen  it coming.
  
Going back to what you said about how Adam and Eve could know it was good to follow God's command without knowledge of good and evil in the first place, I hear all kinds of responses from fundamentalist apologists: ""The point is, it doesn't really matter whether they knew what good and evil was, the point is being obedient,"" they might say. Regardless of whether that even makes sense, that doesn't answer why God didn't see it coming (being omniscient). 
  
Another interesting point is how God can't stand the sight of sin, but he allows Satan to roam around his perfect garden (which he describes as ""good""). If Satan is a fallen angel, I'm pretty sure he fits the definition of *sin personified.* If God is omniscient and omnipotent, why didn't he kick Satan out of the garden? If he wanted to test if Adam and Eve would listen to Satan, we again go back to our growing doubts of whether God really is as omniscient as he claims to be. He should know what Adam and Eve would choose to do, Satan or not. I still wonder how Satan can even roam around *anywhere*, considering he's supposed to be imprisoned in Hell. If he can break out of hell whenever he wants, then that must be part of God's plan, because God is omnipotent and therefore perfectly within the capability of keeping Satan locked up. 
  
Therefore, one can conclude that God *wanted* Adam and Eve to eat the fruit. Think about it: He made the tree, he didn't exactly place it in an inconspicuous location, he let Satan roam the garden to whisper in Eve's ear.... One has to wonder what exactly would happen if Adam and Eve never actually ate the fruit. THAT is the question that I'm curious to being answered.

In conclusion, the Book of Genesis is probably just a metaphorical book. Don't take it literally. Also, I'm an atheist, so sorry if my response sounds a little...well, un-Christian. It's all in good fun. :)"

French or its precursor has been the language of the ruling elite of France for about a millenium, while Dutch wasn't even on equal level in Belgium as recently as a century ago.

As for the French language policy, they do the same things that are decried as narrowminded by French speakers in Belgium: 

&gt;The Toubon Law (full name: law 94-665 of 4 August 1994 relating to usage of the French language), is a law of the French government mandating the use of the French language in official government publications, in all advertisements, in all workplaces, in commercial contracts, in some other commercial communication contexts, in all government-financed schools, and some other contexts."

Abilities: Chaos is most important. Absorb and Mind Control are also very nice to have. Chaos is probably the skill you're going to use most of the time. Just imagine a large wave of enemies, hit that button once and they're suddenly attacking each other. 

Absorb I mainly use as a panic button when my shield/health gets low. It's also nice to draw aggro from a defense mission for example. Also, I went with a maxed Absorb which lasts 10 seconds. It happens quite often you draw all aggro and people mass murder everything before you even finish absorbing :(

Mind Control isn't all that great because everyone can still kill the controlled target. However, if there's a strong enemy, with a simple MC you'll basicly get a free pass to shoot the guy. Also, I did a Def mission yesterday and the pods health dropped to 15% because I got downed and couldn't use Chaos soon enough. There was 1 enemy left that was going for the pod, so I just kept using MC and waited for the pods health to return.

thepapacy,politics,1389007024.0,"Valuing the power people give to personal wealth and status symbols as a measurement of being ""superior"" to someone else is a subjective personal preference. Believing you're superior to someone else because of the social utility you believe other people believe you possess is a defense mechanism to avoid pain and not accept that everything and everyone is impermanent.  As Jimi Hendrix would say, ""And so castles made of sand melts into the sea, eventually"" 


I think when those who are dependent on status seeking such as wealth hoarders are looked at through the lens of behaving like an addict afraid of losing their fix, their possessions and displays of status become less enviable and more a reflection of internal suffering and emotional emptiness. The current ""system"" encourages the mindset because it allows itself to have stability and be replicated which is a selling point to validate the necessity of the idea of an aristocratic minority who benefit from manipulating others into viewing them as ""superior"" instead of just other people with an unequal amount of power, and comfortable with training their ""inferiors"" to be subjugated to that power so they can train other ""inferiors"" to be too which is played out on the local level including the family unit level. The family-community-state relationship in power training is reflexive so they teach each other.

In these events I might have appeared cold even though I did my best not to, I tried hugging and staying close, providing tissues etc. Often though she did not seem to want closeness at those times.

I would just do as any logical person would and try to reason with her, asking her why she was upset and try to break down the logic behind why she was upset. If it didn't make any sense then she wouldn't be upset... or so I thought. Usually these events would last for hours because of this.

Years in the relationship I realized it was better to just sit by quietly and at most just say ""and why is that?"" most of the time and she seemed to recover much quicker. The fact that I was listening was more help than actually helping.


For you I will give you this advice: Try to imagine you don't have feelings. ... Can't? Well as someone who is very emotionless I can say it is very difficult for me to imagine feelings as well. Use words to describe your emotions in an as emotionless way as possible.

It's not like Americans are inherently bad, it's more a symptom of having a crappy economy - GDP may be high, but a majority of Americans aren't exactly feeling that - most of the money goes to the military and rich people, which in many cases are the same thing.

Drict,AskReddit,1389007788.0,"The best, and most accurate can be claimed on all drugs.

1* Tax Dollars; ""Sin tax"", future business dollars, and other taxable items and services (also increasing and bolstering the economy.

This is by far the best answer ever. The United States is rather blind to easy revenue sources due to specific 'moral' requirements. Imagine if instead of going to someone that is supporting a gang, is under control by a gang, getting used to doing illegal things/doing illegal things, you can instead go to a legally run store, supported and protected by the government, creating tons of service jobs (income gets taxed), creating tons of factory jobs (taxed yet again), additional distribution, etc.

2* Re-analyzing/Restructuring of the intention of Enforcement

Imagine that all of the money that is spent on the 'War on Drugs' was instead funneled into resolving issues, paying for hospitals, preventing death, getting people back on their feet, helping people that are self-medicating with the illegal(s), and any number of other beneficial things that could be attained. Imagine when walking down the street, emotionally upset DRUNK, instead of going to a drunk tank, you are checked on by medical personal, given assistance to where-ever you are going, and the officer makes sure you aren't going to get mugged?


What if high on Cocaine? With a little on your nose... instead of going to jail for 5 years, you are brought to a 'drunk' tank (free of fines/charges?)


This also stands with how police treat the ""inferiority groupings"", they have only reason to arrest someone if they are stealing, assaulting someone, murder, etc. Versus going after a drug? Police forces would be trained TOTALLY differently.


3* This allows people to self medicate or use drugs as they please recreationally; without fear of yet again, police.


The US is called a 'free' country, yet we can't do something so simple as adjust our own thinking, or perspective of the world, without fear of having their door broken down, and being shot/arrested.


4* More money;

Think of all the things that people are going to try and pull attention, advertisement, etc. For example over a million dollars PUSHED into the economy in Colorado... That money goes to the owner of the stores? Don't they support their families? Buy new things for their homes? Grow their businesses? Higher more employees?



ALL of the arguments made from either side can be made for each drug, Marijuana, Cocaine, Crystal Meth, LSD, Alcohol, Puffing, or w/e we come up with. People are going to do the drug regardless of it being illegal or not, the question is how we want to treat the individuals that are doing it. If we treat them with the intention of inquiry for WHY they are, assisting them through w/e issue they may have OR realize they are a capable competent individual and is using for pleasure and therefore we have no reason to interfere with their personal decision that effects only themselves (and their families that they are responsible for, which if the family members are young and wish not to associate with them, have a place to, HOORAY FOR TAXING THE DRUGS)


The issue that should be addressed is that people care about what others do that don't affect them aside from a visual issue, and if it does affect them in any other way (such as a broken window or stolen property) should be resolved through the legal system OR through insurance as it currently does, with a stream lining of the systems so that the issues can be inspected and resolved without as much red tape. This can make it so it is possible. This is an ideological issue that many people, can't or won't come to a similar conclusion that I have. The problems are 'getting better', in some respects, but will get FAR worse long term.


As of right now according to **FEDERAL LAW** (you know the stuff that is above state based laws, and can be enforced and overturn the state law, says that Marijuana is still illegal, unless you have a piece of paper giving you permission. So, no, Marijuana is not legal, you are just far less likely to get arrested for it. You would need a federal agent to do so, rather than a state or local officer, but it is STILL illegal.

**MARIJUANA IS STILL ILLEGAL** (read the above paragraph)

TL;DR- All of the illegal substances (or inversed, the legal substances) have the same arguments, the question is merely popular support, based around the majority of the people. They all should be legal on all levels of the government and should all be taxed with profits going to support public works, AND helping those that need it, because of said drugs. The extra 'profits' should be used to resolve the nations debates and reducing taxes in the long run."

I'm sorry for the ad hominem. You were saying that we should *decree* that an EU-state is the goal and do what is necessary to get there... but that's totally contrary to the premise of the project. Everybody needs to agree every step of the way. Not respecting that would make it fail instantly.

&gt;The European Union needs to slow down, stop expanding so fast and actually negotiate what it is and agree on it's future. Those treaties arn't effective, the treaties are what is promulgating authority.

That would *reduce* the amount of agreement we are having, because we only get to negotiate once. ""Everything is decided in Brussels in non-transparant ways"" is one of the biggest criticisms vs. the EU at this point. How would making one big decision in Brussels that eliminates every room to weigh in except for the details for the next century going to make that better?

&gt;This is evident. The common European citizen, educated citizens, barely understand how the government structure of the European Union works. This, at least for me, is solidified by the fact that many subscribers on this very subreddit don't understand that the European Parliament doesn't have a legislative mandate. Many barely understand the difference between the Commission and the Council, and I for one, see them as simply two groups that mirror each other except for semantics.

I agree, there's a lack of transparency.

&gt;And you know why they feel like this? Because the European Union has a shitty fucking PR department. And this is because they have a identity crisis. It doesn't know what it wants to be, a consolidated supranational union which emulates a nation-state, or a loose confederation of nations. Because of this institutional confusion, the citizens are confused, which means they feel disconnected. This leads to BIG problems down the road.

While I do agree that there's a PR problem, it's not caused by an identity problem: the EU is an open-ended project, it's in its nature. The problem is an unclear distribution of competences, allowing different institutions to blame each other.

Setting in stone what the end goal is of the project is easier said than done. There *is* no agreement in Europe where the EU should end, we can hardly manufacture it, can we?"

Berean_Katz,DebateAChristian,1389008639.0,"&gt;The question then becomes whether God can issue an immoral command

Christian Answer: Something is moral because God commands it.

Atheist Response: Therefore, when God commanded the Israelites to slaughter the heathens around them (including women and male children) and take the virgin daughters for themselves (**Numbers 31**), that's moral because God says it is? How in the world is that sense of morality superior to secular ethics and humanism?

Christian counter-response: CONTEXT!

Atheist cc-response: What possible context is it OK to kill an entire civilization of people (including women and children) and take the virgin daughters to own for yourself? If it's part of God's ultimate plan, that fails to take into account that God is omnipotent and omniscient, meaning he should be absolutely capable of doing his work *without* killing a bunch of people. Once again we wonder: if God is so omniscient, why does he even get surprised when the Jews fail him so many times, and why does he get mad when the Midianites act ""sinful""? AND why can't he just come down and *teach* the ""heathens"" how to act as opposed to just killing practically everyone except the female virgins? Questions, questions, questions."

Getting hit with an axe is far worse than being pounced on and that's how they started the attack.

Also, ""Ms Kauser, 18, and her brother turned on the gunmen, killing one and injuring two more. Police praised their courage."" If only one guy was killed, but the commander was shot to death (which is supported by ""The militants are not going to leave us after this embarrassment in which a top commander was killed."") then neither her nor her brother killed anyone with an axe.

SublethalDose,aspergers,1389009570.0,"I wish my parents had taken the time to think seriously about the questions I had and discuss basic social interactions with me.  I think they never had to think analytically about the basics of social interactions, so to them it seemed like thinking about social skills WAS my problem, and if I just stopped thinking and worrying, it would all come out okay.  If they couldn't answer a question, and they were fine, obviously I was on the wrong track in asking the question.  

In other words, what I really wanted was not advice or reassurances but actual social *coaching* — I wanted my parents to take up the challenge of helping me improve and learn and perform socially, just like an athletic coach forms a partnership with a player to promote the player's performance.  My dad was actually a great athletic coach.  He could adjust my batting stance by a quarter of an inch and tell me to shoot a mid-range jumper off the glass, but he could barely tell me a single useful thing about interacting with people.  All he could do was tell me I was doing fine and shouldn't worry.  The contrast between his social unhelpfulness and his sports coaching was stark.  My physical gifts were nearly as limited as my social gifts, but I was frequently an all-star player in youth sports leagues thanks to my dad's coaching.  It was awesome to have an experienced, thoughtful person on my side who dedicated his knowledge to helping me succeed.  I had a dad who devised batting drills for me and threw buckets of balls to me while other kids had parents whose sole contribution was to sit in the stands and yell, ""YAY!  YOU CAN DO IT!"" and then ""IT'S OKAY!"" after their kid struck out.  Really?  Is it really okay that your kid strikes out every time?  You might want to check with him about that.  He doesn't look okay with it.  I know *I* didn't feel okay about my social failures no matter how much my parents tried to convince me that everything was okay and normal and I should just not worry about anything.

I think the coaching analogy is strengthened by the fact that coaching a sport is generally known and acknowledged to be a different skill from playing the sport.  My dad knew that just being good at a sport and talking to me about how he experienced being good at it would not necessarily be helpful to me.  Part of his job as a coach was to understand what was going on in my head so he could frame things in a way that made sense to me.  People do not always show this level of respect when attempting to teach another person, especially when there is a relationship of authority, but it's the only effective way.

So, what would it mean for you to be a social coach for your son?  First of all, it means you should be an ally and a resource for your son in his social development.  He should know that your knowledge, experience, and attention are at his disposal when he is facing social challenges, and that you won't use these assets as bargaining chips to force him to accept your point of view, not even for his own good.  They're his unconditionally (within reasonable limits vis-a-vis the amount of time you can spend, of course.)  Second of all, your next order of business is to understand how your son sees his social challenges.  I don't think you're used to thinking this way, because your post gives a pretty good idea of how your son looks from the outside, but no insight into how he sees himself.  Does he realize he has social limitations?  Is he frustrated and disappointed with his lack of friends?  It's striking that you left this information out, because at this point in his life, only he can be the driving force.  You can persuade him, help him understand things in new ways, and assist him in furthering his interests as he sees them, but he's the boss.  You should try to know his mind as well as a servant knows his master's mind, which is to say, better than he does.

If that sounds scary to you as a parent, let me assure you that it is a powerful way to exercise influence.  When I was doing sports with my dad, I was the boss from the very beginning, when I was barely more than a toddler.  If I wanted to practice fielding, we practiced fielding.  If I wanted to practice batting, we practiced batting.  If I wanted to stay home and read instead, that's what we did.  And always, he took it for granted that whatever he wanted me to do, the burden was on him to figure out how to persuade me that it was a good idea.  If he couldn't, we did it my way.  As a result, sports was the area where I trusted and followed my dad more than any other.  

&gt; 'hobbies'

On a final note, the quotes used here make me assume his ""hobbies"" are really lame and embarrassing.  One of your son's goals is to earn the respect of other people, and here you are undermining him!  Tsk tsk!  Being an ally means standing shoulder to shoulder, not attempting to help from a comfortable distance.

ta1901,AskMen,1389009944.0,"Below is how to be a good person in general while dating. 

What matters in a girl who is relationship material (or any person)

* They treat me like an equal, understand and care about my feelings and needs, and pay for some dates. 
* They can talk about problems like a rational adult so we can work them out together. 
* They have clear communication. I can't read minds, so this is essential. 
* They are sex-positive. 
* They are compatible with me and at least some of my interests and attitudes. (I prefer positive girls who achieve their goals.)
* They do not try to fill the void in her soul with material things. While material gifts is one of the [love languages,](http://www.5lovelanguages.com/) a shopping addiction can kill a relationship. 
* They pull their weight in the relationship. Not all men want to pay for all dates. Don't assume things, ask him. 
* I like a girl that has the confidence to do her own thing, be her own person. Be spontaneous, and quirky. She might dye her hair a neon color, dress her own style, and just be herself. 
* They should be attractive. That does not mean I'm looking for a Barbie doll. Even a 5 out of 10 has a certain attractiveness. 
* She should be an asset not a liability. 
* Don't be crazy. She should deal with her emotional and medical issues. 
* They should not have any addictions, including addiction to shopping, internet, Facebook, etc. 
* They should know how to manage money so they understand why I do the things I do. 
* She should know and understand her needs and know which is her [love language.](http://www.5lovelanguages.com/)
* She should have good communication. A girl that keeps me guessing what she wants is not relationship material. 
* She should be able to take care of herself, that means a full time job. I don't want another dependent. 
* She should understand that men are not women with a penis. Men and women might have similar goals, but they often have different ways of getting there. They also communicate differently. Know the differences. 
* She should have realistic expectations for the relationship, not some Disney-esque fantasy. 



*****
**Being a good girl/boyfriend in an LTR**

1. Don't be crazy. Don't over react to things. Talk things out calmly like an adult. If you need reassurance, say that you need reassurance. People don't always pick up on the needs of others, so you have to tell them your needs.
2. If you have emotional issues, consult a professional and deal with them. An adult fixes problems, a child just ignores them. 
3. Never assume something about a person. Gather facts, verify the facts, and then make a decision based on facts. 
4. Communicate clearly. Never assume. If you want to stay home, say so. If you want Chinese food, say so. 
5. I like to share emotions but let's be appropriate about what we share and when. 
6. Don't give them your heart until they prove they are worth it. 
7. Don't over think things. This is similar to assuming. Over thinking will just feed your insecurities. Don't do it. 
8. Women need to do more in asking out men on dates, and initiating in bed. ""Lazy"" is not the same as ""submissive"". 
9. If someone won't have sex before marriage, tell them that by the second date. You have the right to say no, they have the right to find someone compatible.

So, for instance, he never really pushed me to get into sports. And I never really learned how to play them. I could play a game of basketball, but I'd have trouble with baseball and I have no idea what's going on in football. Now that I'm an adult, I feel really stupid asking people how to play sports, so if I'm ever around and people start wanting to play, I usually try to stay out of it. It's too embarrassing to admit that I don't know how to play. 

When I was a teenager, he never really pushed me to date. I don't know if that would have made a difference, but he didn't talk to me about women and he didn't ever suggest that I go out with them.

You miss out on a lot of the freedoms and fun you'd expect from leaving high school - heck, I can't even own a car for another two years, or even have a fridge in my room - and the daily life is... restrictive, to say the least. Add on top of that an academic load rivalling a postgrad college (16 semester hour *minimum*) and ""Embrace the suck"" becomes more literal than you'd ever want to know.

If you go into it knowing ""It's going to *suck* for four years, but what I learn and the career that follows is what I'm after,"" then pursue a SA. But if you had any semblance of a desire for a ""normal"" college experience - the freedom of choice, not having a 0600-2000 full schedule, not having to worry about whether your bed's hospital corners are perfect 45*... then run like hell and find a ROTC program or something."

Because all you've given us to go on is ""There's a leak... somewhere. I don't know enough about the system to describe it better.""

Doesn't really give us much information, nor does it inspire much confidence in your abilities. HVAC can be complicated. With the information given, there's just no way for us to know what's wrong, or even begin to describe a repair procedure.

Another thing - since this is an apartment, there's a good chance that one system serves multiple apartments. So theres a good chance that you flat out don't have access to parts of the system that need to be accessed."

Whenever something is too difficult for me to repair though, I'll ask my mom to give it to a friend of hers who is really good at it, but small stuff I'll do myself.

I once blew the mind of my friend's aunt with that too. I was at her place, and she's a really Christian woman, who believes in strict gender roles. Something was wrong with my jacket and I asked if she had needle and thread. She told me she would fix it for me, and I gently declined the offer and told her I prefer fixing my own stuff. The entire time I was fixing my jacket she was just wandering around confused and not really knowing what to do. It was just so odd to her that I, a guy, was fixing his jacket with needle and thread, and wouldn't let a woman take care of it."

Don't taxes pay for both? If the cost of firefighting was large enough, like 5% of the total tax income of the state, I would consider volunteering for 5% of my time and getting a tax break. But as it is right now, the training would be longer than the time I would have to volunteer.

&gt; You have to have paid enough tax for someones welfare before receiving it yourself.

The chronological relation is exactly the reverse. And... don't you have to be actively looking for a job to receive any welfare already? Because that would be essentially the same.

There is absolutely no guarantee that someone looking for a job will actually get one (and pay back the welfare in taxes). But applying for X number of positions gives it a chance.

undergroundmonorail,TruePokemon,1389011115.0,"Agreed. I had done some reading before discovering him, so I understood the very basics of competitive play, but watching Shofu helped me out a lot early on. Things like knowing how much risk to take and when/how hard to predict are best learned through experience, but failing that, watching someone else play a real, actual game isn't a horrible substitute. Because of how active he is, you also get to see what threats are prominent right now, whereas articles could get you prepared for threats that just don't exist any more.

None of this is specific to Shofu, really, but he's my favourite. :P

After a while of playing, you start to develop your own playstyle (for example, I honestly think Shofu predicts too hard in a lot of cases, and in his shoes I'd be playing more safely a lot of the time), but it's beneficial to get an idea of how *someone* plays, even if it's not you."

Cue ""holy shit we're not alone"" and ""wait so we were seeded by this thing?"" and so much mo- oh wait.  No more of the obvious and interesting sci-fi implications - nope, the rest of the book is about how it affects religion and how it causes otherwise rational and previously militantly atheistic characters to find God.  And how crazy cults spring up around it (which, to be fair, they would), and eventually are sneaky enough to set up enough bombs in the military-controlled town that built itself around the ship to destroy it in a single hit, while simultaneously performing suicide bombings ALL OVER THE WORLD.

Either that or drinking to forget. Being drunk only makes you forget the present, not the past and only distracts by making it harder to walk to the bathroom. If you aren't distracted (e.g., your ""tolerance"" is high from a lot of nights of this, or you're just really hyperfocused on what you want to forget because you can't remember anything else being so drunk), it may be tempting to keep drinking in this false hope you'll forget eventually. Still boils down to drinking too much too fast before realizing you're dying."

to

Most men aren't capable of warding off a full-force attack (not the stand-off, fists raised honor-fighting after some drunk shenanigans, but a real ""I am going to cripple and/or kill you""-attack), so as a women, it's a lot smarter to try and NEVER engage unless forced.

Just because someone is liberal and open minded doesn't mean he/she will shag everything with a pulse. The same applies to alcohol btw. Just because we think its fine doesn't mean we do it everywhere and all the time and with anyone. 

Also, open minded doesn't mean laissez faire. One of the main reasons I won't recommend my sister to have sex is because society will judge her and treat her differently. They will think she is worthless because of a hymen between her legs (or lack thereof). She is a human being, she can do whatever she wants but in our sexually repressed culture there are consequences and I can only warn her against them. 

Conservative muslims like yourself are so fucking obsessed with sex its ridiculous.

The original concept is from John Wick and his Wicked Fantasy collaborator Gillian Fraser provided the mechanics. Each artifact has certain powers that fall into 10 different skill trees. The player  next to you plays the hero that wields you. You need to negotiate with your hero to try to persuade them to accomplish your goals, if the hero chooses to put you down well congratulations you are now a lump of metal and not going anywhere anytime soon.

Features: Quick and painless combat system where players physically signal actions in 2 rounds with players allowed to alter between ""attack "", ""defend"" and ""magic"". No initiative (although magic takes priority) other wise everything is resolved after the 2 rounds. simultaneously. 

Difficulty goes from 1 to 5 - easy to impossible:

1. Climbing a ladder

2. Climbing a ladder and someone is shooting you

3. Climbing a ladder and someone is shooting you and you are carrying someone

4. Climbing a ladder and someone is shooting you and you are carrying someone and the ladder is on fire

5. Climbing a ladder and someone is shooting you and you are carrying someone and the ladder is on fire and you are shooting back

Level 5 is only accomplish-able  with the use of magic.

reginaidiotarum,TumblrInAction,1389011807.0,"Some post-modernist thinkers have some really great idea. Freeing yourself from the limits of narrative structures allows for a level of higher thinking about pieces, and, in return, higher thinking about reality. From a philosophical standpoint it's freeing to not limit yourself by judgement of others.

However, these people treat Po-Mo like they do feminism. Rather than acknowledging that all narratives are lies, even the ones we find ourselves clinging to, they damn everyone that does not agree with their collective narrative. Post Modernism was the existentialist's answer to Nietzsche a la Pascal's Wager. ""Sure religion and science won't actually provide the answers to all of our questions, sure we live a lie. Why is that bad?""

Now, of course, we can see why individuals that don't currently like the grand narratives of Science and Religion would gravitate to this way of thinking. Smart people that were creative and expressive, but mad at the world. Well, this, and the fact that early post-modernists expressed this lack of grand narrative structure by re-writing it from the perspectives of the disenfranchised. They became the rulers of these domains, and, as Karl Marx would predict, the lower class became the upper class and started imposing their will on the new lower class.

Geohump,psychology,1389011875.0,"Actually the claim that is made is that ADHD is not a single disease, but instead, is a cluster of symptoms.

Thats nearly 100% different than saying ADHD doesn't exist.

We know ADHD exists (no matter if its a single disease or a cluster of symptoms) because we can see it!  

Take a look at this picture, [see the difference between the first two brains?](http://i0.wp.com/iconnectdots.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/brains-4.jpg?resize=600%2C245)

That's the actual difference between a brain with no ADHD and  a brain with ADHD.

See the third brain?  That's the second brain after its been medicated.

So, yes ADHD exists, its very real. The biggest problem is that FMRI brain scans are not being used as part of the diagnostic path, which is malpractice. You can't really diagnose ADHD in a differentiable way from depression, and anxiety (and other comorbidities) without a FMRI brain scan.  So if you do the diagnosis without the brain scan, you are very likely to end up treating the wrong problem.

silverionmox,PoliticalDiscussion,1389011970.0,"&gt;I think you don't understand what sexism is.

1. *prejudice or discrimination based on sex*: you refuse to give one person the same opportunities than another one in the same situation, because they have a different sex.

2. *behavior, conditions, or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex*: You use ""being a man is"": what else but an appeal to common stereotypes is that?

&gt; Sexism is not acknowledging and understanding the responsibilities that a man has to his family

The question of the thread is: how far do these responsbilities go?

&gt;that is just doing what is right.

You're just saying ""I'm right, you're wrong"" now.

&gt;Crying sexism here means you acknowledge that you lost the argument

Making statements about who ""won"" or ""lost"" an argument is a hallmark of maturity, naturally.

&gt;You might as well call me a racist, bigot, and homophobe while you are at it.

I have no reason to call you that.

&gt;Abortion IS killing a person, opting out of a pregnancy is not but it seriously hurts the child's life forever.
Parenthood IS a life changing event, but it is also not an option when it occurs. There is no turning back once you conceive. Again I believe both people already made their choices once conception has occurred. 

You could have said right away that you're not pro-choice. Obviously, if women can't opt out, then men shouldn't be able either. And women only get it as a side effect of abortion.

&gt;This means that for a man to be called a man

That's not a meaningful statement for people who have different conceptions of a gender role. In this case, people who don't think being a man means being forced to suffer the consequences of decisions taken by other people.

Any way, we're discussing whether a man should get the same chance do decline his parental responsibilities like a woman does."
Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389011983.0,"Right, assassination is the wrong word.  Let's call it ""the plot to kill Che Guevara"" instead.  Here, check out [this](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB5/) page.  It's links to a bunch of declassified documents that demonstrate that the CIA used Green Berets to train Bolivian soldiers as part of an effort to capture and kill Guevara.  While I don't have any rock solid evidence, my dad was a Green Beret with the 8th at the time of these operations, and insinuated on several occasions that he had been involved with that mission, so it's my belief that he was likely one of those Green Berets mentioned in those documents.  

When he was on his deathbed, he wrote me several pages of notes detailing his military career (which he'd always been evasive about, but had promised to tell me ""someday"").  On one of the pages is a outline of what he wanted to write about -- like a table of contents for the rest of the notes -- and one of them is ""Explain the CIA thing with Guevara"".  Unfortunately, there is no further explanation.  He was in the late stages of pancreatic cancer and on a lot of medication and was not entirely lucid, so the notes aren't always entirely clear, he repeats himself a lot, and some of the entries are things like ""Tell [my name] about that thing with the thing.""  It's actually kind of painful to read, as he was clearly coming apart mentally at the end.  "

As for a mass gain each year, I think you should take a look at this article:

[How Much Muscle Can You Build Naturally?](http://www.muscleforlife.com/how-much-muscle-can-you-build-naturally)

The thing is, your potential for growth does diminish the longer you're training, hence ""noob-gainz"" and that mantra. 

While this is all good information, whatever you do, don't set your bar low. These so-called calculators/potential generators are all based on *ideal conditions*, which pretty much no one has. Just get in there, lift hard, eat right, sleep well, and see what *you* can gain.

Hirosakamoto,funny,1389012151.0,"Episode 1 had no real main character for us to give a fuck about. Should have focused more on obi-wan and have maul live to give him some motivation. They can keep all of the jarjar stuff in if they want, but if they are going into the city to not draw attention, leave his dumbass behind. Also who brings a damned kid to a war zone? The pacing of the movie was horrid, and a lot of the logic behind the characters decisions was non-existent. 

Episode 2 is better, but only a bit more so. If Obi-wan and anakin are such great friends, show them actually being friends instead of telling us they are in one elevator scene. Have maul fuck up some diplomatic event that would have stopped the war, get obi-wan pissed and have anakin witness the fight to introduce him to rage fueled fights. Maybe bring in a few of the other smaller yet important characters into light like the Organas and Mon Martha or something.

Episode 3 Was the best of the 3, but holy crap did we not need 40 minutes of anakin and obi-wan fighting over over-done CGI areas. If they are so skilled then what would ever compel you to jump on some of the shit around you instead of just doing what they did at the end and jump on the land. Show anakin more rage-induced instead of emo/sad over shit. Also the actor for anakin should NEVER have gotten that part. 

Honestly the only good things in the prequals was seeing palpatines rise to power. Most of the fights were pretty lame and unnecessarily long, the actors were pretty god damn bad for the most part.

If they had just had people to challenge Lucas and be like, ""Hey, do you REALLY need some of this shit in there?"" and make him try to condense, streamline, and edit the movie differently they could have just kept EVERYTHING the same. Cut out some of the War scenes, the 10938120312903 people on screen fighting...this isn't lord of the rings. The fights were just a clusterfuck with all of the blasterbolts and lightsabers all over the damned place, just too busy.

Even in the games we lost, Clarke was always experimenting and rarely made negative decisions. Rather than spread the field when we're behind, he'll risk an early loss by setting an aggressive field.

I appreciate my job, but it's not what I wanted. I have a degree, almost completed an MA, and then my chronic illness finally went too far and I had to give up on my dream of a PhD. It was crushing - there was a space for me on the program even before I handed in my Thesis. They really wanted me, and I would have been the first PhD candidate to operate in that area in my Uni. The opportunity is long gone. They were sad for me too, which was heartwarming.

I'm currently on leave from the job I didn't ever envision having because of the same illness, feeling horrible, and your comment cheered me up a lot.

Lightroom, while powerful, I believe tends to dumb down the user, and creates an echo chamber of 'like' photography because of the overuse of presets/actions built in. 

It's kind of a like a bigger version of instagram.

Just my Opinion. I know some folks get touchy about these things.

I use 'The Gimp' along with Corel's Paintshop pro and Nikon's Capture NX2 for editing and ViewNX2 ( a freebie ) for file browsing, exif tags etc...

The Gimp is free, very capable... there are tons of youtube tutorials. It's as close to Photoshop as I think you can get... and costs nothing.

Corel's Paintshop pro, depending on which version or bundle is also highly capable and comes with some neat features, HDR capability, photo-merge, alignment tools etc... It's around $60 or so.

Nikon's Capture NX2 is about $100 or so... Is a fantastic RAW editor (at least for Nikon) has some fantastic features... the control point editing is just awesome, but lacks a couple of things that should be in any editing program... like a real clone tool.

tsunamishadow,tf2,1389012333.0,"Okay first, if you're just learning Spy don't learn trickstabs first! Trickstabs are largely desperation moves that are rarely, if at all, used in a game, it's generally better to just run away if you are in a problem.

Here are some main points:

* Never think that your disguise or cloak is foolproof, while the worst players may not notice you bumping into them, the best players will just see right though you and kill you. Spies don't fare too well in a fair fight.

* How you behave when disguised is also a giveaway, an Engineer on the front line is suspicious, maintaining eye contact with a 'teammate' is suspicious, moving in the wrong direction is suspicious. They will get you quickly killed.

* Due to the absence of Friendly Fire, there's no reason for a 'teammate' not to spycheck you, so disguises can only go so far. Being invisible is much better.

* If you bump into someone, it's best to assume they've just found you, you are going to need to switch what you are doing if you want to get anywhere.

* An effective spy will plan their attack. Being able to 'trade' with the Medic is still a plan as you have just traded the least important class on your team - yourself - for their most important class. Most common plans attack with a known escape route. A run-and-stab spy is fun, but barely ever works.

* The same spy especially beginner spies can get very predictable, one of my server buddies is a very good spy, but rarely gets an opening to kill me because I know what she'll do. If you are constantly screwing up a game the same way as a spy, just cool off and switch to another class.

* Each watch differs how the spy approaches a situation.

Billtodamax,fireemblem,1389012709.0,"Alright, before I launch into the next chapter I'm gonna get everyone to level 11 in the tower. It's kinda fun just shitting all over statistically inferior enemies, but boy does it burn through weapon usages. Especially if you get Ewan to solo levels which I do because I find that hilarious and I want S-rank dark.

CHAPTER 20: There's only 1 stone intact (thanks Eirika) so we're going to need some bad dudes to take out the evil demon guy. Luckily I have just the squad of bad dudes. Also holy shit, is there really a lovecraft reference in this game? Sweet.

I'm not sure how Lyon knows about Myrrh cause I've never onced used her. 

Wow you can take way too many fucking units on this map. Alright so The wonder twins and Tana will haul their little support triangle north, with back up from RossxEwan, LutexArtur, JoshuaxL'Arachel, FranzxAmelia, and MarisaxGerik. Cormag and Vanessa who have not been able to swing any supports will fly over the mountains and start fucking shit up with a couple of awesome spears.

Incidentally, now's a good time to share where all the fun weapons have gone. Brave lance to Cormag, Vidofnir to Vanessa, Aura and Latona to L'Arachel, Brave Sword to Amelia, Franz gets a bunch of killer and silver weapons, Ewan gets all the dark tomes and Fimbulvetr, Gerik gets the Brave Axe, Marisa gets Audhulma, Joshua gets a, uh, Runesword I guess, Ross gets Garm, Tana gets a Silver lance and a Runesword I guess, Eirika gets Sieglinde and her Rapier, Ephraim gets Siedmund and Reginleif, Artur gets Ivaldi, and finally Lute gets Bolting and Excalibur.

Gerik's wearing the boots.

At the split in the path I send GerikxMarisa, LutexArtur, and RossxEwan up. Everyone else goes down. You may have noticed that everyone else is entirely horse mounted except for Joshua (who is at the back) and Tana (who runs off ahead). Apparently they can all get through the mountains one square at a time, which is annoying, but they had the short route anyway.

Uh.

Somewhere in there Cormag brave lanced Riev to death then was physic'd by L'Arachel, who is just hurling those things all around the map.

Now the boss ignores defense, so he one-shots L'Arachel, Artur, and Vanessa. I gave Amelia a Dragon Axe though, so I figure that'll work. She leaves Morva on exactly 2 health, so Franz wanders over and bonks him with a spear.

I break the hammerne repairing the Vidofnir (Vanessa is *loving* it) then seize without dicking around with supports for what must be the first time ever. I'm so confused.

CHAPTER THE ONE AFTER THE PREVIOUS ONE: Did we really, *really* need another flashback. Aw jeez now I have way too few units available. I'm gonna sit out Vanessa, Joshua, and Cormag. Vanessa and Cormag because they aren't in supports, and Joshua because he's my weakest link, goodbye.

It's honestly a lot easier pushing everyone down one side, so that's what I'm going to do. Gerik and Marisa will take the lead with the Brave Axe and Audhulma. Amelia and Franz will follow up, and the wonder twins + Tana will bring up the rear. Ross and all of my magic damage will be lagging even further back, slinging heals, and dealing with anything that circles around. It's gonna be a pretty balls to the walls affair, so I'm just charging Gerik and Marisa up as far as they can go and killing any enemies that are there, with their buddies cleaning up anything smart enough not to attack me. The dragon gets crit down by Audhulma.

I push up on the boss and have a scary moment where Gerik is caught outside his support range and almost killed by like, 3 50% shots when I get up to the shadow shot gorgons, but I can kill one next turn along with all the regular gorgons, so they are hardly even a threat.

Artur lures the dragon over on the right and murders the shit out of him with Ivaldi, while Ross stands next to the boss, is dropped to 2 health, and in return garms him twice without critting. I want my money back, some berserker you are.

I just garm him again instead of dealing with the rest of the enemies, because I like my weapon uses.

CHAPTER THE NEXT ONE THAT'S SORTA THE SAME ONE I GUESS: Last time there was apparently a mountain of corpses. This time Eirika and Ephraim use their bullshit super weapons to drop him to 26 then are instantly healed to full by L'Arachel's Fortify, while everyone else tries in vain to get to the boss before he's gibbed. He summons in enemies to try and cut me off, but it's way, way too late for that. I kill the fucker with Ephraim.

GGNORE SACRED STONES.

This playthrough was interesting in two ways: I got to use a good Vanessa, which is a first, and I played in Hard. Beyond that it was mostly godly units in other playthroughs disappointing me in this one - I've had Tanas with 5 more strength and max skill and speed, mine had seriously 14 skill. I've had cormags who rammed straight into the strength and defense caps, my current one is just sorta mediocre. I've had Rosses who fucking rocked shit, whereas the current one can't dodge and can't take a hit. I guess I also used supports a shit ton more than in normal and holy shit, they are broken as hell.

Most of my units were pretty disappointing to be honest - not bad, per se, but not great. MVP will have to go to two units, each part of different pairings. These mvp awards are honestly mostly for the A-rank supports as a unit, but they go to the stronger unit in each support.

First up is Lute: Ever since I got her she was probably the best unit on my team. Ramming hard into her magic cap in tier one, she also got a shitton of luck and speed, so she dodge-tanked all day every day. Artur as support was just awesome, I could basically send them out to stand on a couple forests and have them mend each other while any enemy in the game that didn't have a long bow was counter-killed to death. Artur's magic disappointed me though, so much so that as I was running through the tower, his effective hits on monsters were often only a point of damage more than lute's normal hits using the same tome (Shine).

The next MVP award goes to Marisa. This was a tough one to give - Gerik was great too - but Marisa's ability to dodge absolutely everything including magic and poison weapons meant she was usually the one healthiest after all was said and done. They saved my shit in chapter 19, and were always consistent. I might have been worried putting Lute/Artur in against waves of enemies just because they could get knicked down - I was never worried about Gerik and Marisa.

I would have liked to give an mvp to L'Arachel - she was pretty great after I trained her up on the metis tome, and I badly needed a good staff user at that point to use Latona - but her best pairing option, Ephraim, was already taken by Tana. I paired her up with Joshua, but he didn't get enough strength to impress, so she was always held back by that.

The epilogues are generally pretty bland, although a fun game to play is seeing how many countries you can get Eirika and Ephraim to be in charge of. Generally 3 is the max, with L'Arachel Ephraim and Eirika Innes.

I'd like to talk a bit about dark magic in sacred stones, and more generally how fucking awful it is compared to anima and especially light. For anima mages you have: Lute, who is a great unit, Artur, who is a great unit, L'Arachel, who is a great unit, Ewan, who is a great unit, Saleh, who isn't bad for a prepromote, and probably a couple others I'm forgetting right now. They're all basically awesome, and the tomes they use are light and relatively high-damaging. Really good all game. For light magic, you get fucking bishops. Bishops are the most broken shit in Sacred stones because all of their magical bullshit books deal effective damage against all endgame enemies. Artur is awesome, Moulder and Natasha can both also be awesome.

Dark magic you get 2 guys. You can use Knoll, who I believe is actually the example the oxford english dictionary uses when you look up both bland and mediocre; or you can use Ewan, who has a con of 5. This isn't so bad for Ewan normally - Anima books are pretty light, as are light tomes. Dark tomes are heavy as shit. This means if you want to double someone at all speedy, you use flux. Ewan is basically married to the body ring from the desert if he's a druid and wants to use his tomes at all effectively. 

To top it all off, when you start getting the magical bullshit weapons and it comes to Grado's contribution you get what I think is the best one (Garm, giving axe users who love it that sweet, sweet +5 speed) and what is clearly the worst one - Gleipnir, which weighs fucking 20 and *isn't even effective against endgame enemies, like literally every other S rank weapon*. It gives you skill plus five but what it should give you is fucking con plus 5, and weigh half as much. And be effective.

If you want a good dark magic user, the best thing to do, easily, is to use the enemy control glitch to get Moulder a bunch of Stones from gorgons in that one forgettable map where you bust eggs, and train him up to D dark magic on that map. Then you get a dark magic user that deals effective damage with Gleipnir and has the con to not take -16 AS from using the damn thing.

Also, they nerfed the shit out of Luna (hello 50 hit). Nosferatu is basically all dark magic has going for it, and you know what? It weighs 14. /rant

Anyway this is a pretty great game. Not as great as FE7 was but that's a high fucking benchmark to set. Definitely one of my favourites."

carolinecupcake,MakeupAddiction,1389012875.0,"It looks like a white-ish color, beige-y, gray and a dark-gray-almost-black-shimmer, right? There's several things you can do with this palette, and it's a great starter palette. 

-Depending on your skin tone you could use one of the lighter two colors as a brow bone highlight and/or a base color. 

-I like to use a beige color with darker grays in my crease for a smoky look that's also subtle enough to day (probably my favorite look)

-Use the gray as your lid color and black as the crease

-White in the inner corner and fade to the gray/black

-Simple look with all over lightest color and beige in the crease

-highlight with first color, lid with 2nd, inner corner gray and blend to dark gray


These are just a few ideas to get started. I know when I got my first palette it was really overwhelming and I had no idea where to start. The best advice I have is maybe start with a few of these looks and then experiment with different techniques and combinations. Check out some YouTube videos for different looks but just use your colors instead to get a feel for the shadows. Good luck!!!

Megaross,AdviceAnimals,1389012957.0,"&gt; Lets be totally honest here -- you don't get cirrhosis of the liver from casual alcohol use at parties. It comes from regular, heavy, repeated abuse. You said yourself you drank heavily for a decade. You can deny it is self-medication all you like, but a decade of alcohol abuse is self-medicating. Its not just 'being a teenager'. 

How is drinking every weekend when you're young alcohol abuse? Literally everyone does that, I don't know anyone who didn't drink and do drugs when they were young.

Yeah I drank a little more than some, and experimented a lot with drugs but it hardly qualifies as alcohol abuse, it's just going out drinking with the band, or going to a house party, or a good session down the pub. 

It's not sitting around miserable drinking to solve a problem, that is where you're going wrong, you assume a lot.

Also, mild cirrhosis, note, mild.

&gt;But like I said, to each his own. Its your life to ruin. Just don't try to drag everyone else down with you, nor act as if anyone who has chosen to be happy and positive is somehow lesser than you, stupid, or delusional. Those moments are rare for you because you've chosen to be a negative, bitter person. /shrug

People who are happy all the time just simply do not understand or do not care about all the problems in the world today. The world is awash with huge social issues and flaws, corruption, pain and death all exist in massive amounts larger than their counterparts. People waft through life, never thinking, just focused on their own selfish needs.

If you cannot see that, you are delusional. I mean most people don't even think about the fact right now tyranical dictators are murdering their own people to achieve some backwards ideology, or that most of the wealth in the developed world is developed on the back of sweatshops and near slave labour, but they get upset about the most fucking menial shit things. Ignorance is bliss, whether you choose to believe it or not, then again, maybe your general level of happiness tied in with that speaks volumes.

What have you done recently that was good for the world, do tell?"

wordserious,AskReddit,1389013061.0,"&gt; A remake doesn't mean the original disappears. 

No, but it means other original movies never get made. Studios have limited budgets and only produce a certain number of movies per year. Doing remakes means less money available for original projects. To help you understand how I feel, I'll show you a list of movies I saw in the theater and liked, year by year, during my early 20s:

. 1985: Goonies, Back to the Future, Breakfast Club, Weird Science, Brazil by Terry Gilliam, The Color Purple.

. 1986: Stand by Me, Top Gun, Aliens, Ferris Bueller, Labyrinth, Platoon, Highlander, Blue Velvet.

. 1987: Full Metal Jacket, Predator, Empire of the Sun, Robcop, Spaceballs, Dirty Dancing, The Lost Boys, Plains Trains and Automobiles,.

. 1988: Die Hard, Coming to America, Big, Beetlejuice, Rain Man, Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

. 1989: Indiana Jones and the Last Cruzade, Back to the Future Part II, Dead Poets Society.

And these are just *American* movies, I'm not counting other nationalities and at that time I used to watch a lot of European and independent movies. Just the first 5 years of my 20s. Just the movies I saw and liked. And it used to be like this also when I was growing up and in my teenage years, all through the 70s and early 80s too, and it continued into the 90s and up to 2000. Then the remake craze and the unending serials began in earnest and still haven't ended.

This is a lovely game set in the world famous Portobello Market area of London in the early 1900's. You are a shopkeeper building stalls around the market, but you can only build where the police (the Bobby!) is located, so you've got to move him where you want him - but your opponent is trying to do the same.

It's an elegant, simple system of building lines of market stalls, similar in the vein of *Thurn &amp; Taxis* or perhaps *Ticket To Ride*. It was published in 2007 and hasn't been reprinted since, so I'm not sure how easy it is to find... but it's one that's worth nabbing if you do!"

Intigo,GuildWars2Builds,1389013845.0,"A few things:

* That Food is terrible, use something else.

* Your Sigils don't work together. All Sigils with a cooldown will share their cooldown, Blood should be Force.

* All your Exotic Jewelry Upgrades should include Critical Damage because it's the best Critical Damage ratio ingame.

* Your Power is so low that you should be using Sharpening Stones instead of Maintenance Oil. See http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1li5q3/breakeven_points_of_power_vs_precision_mathtable/

* I am not a fan of Celestial Jewelry. You have enough Celestial, focus on beefening up your primary stats. I know this may not be something you like hearing seeing as you may already have bought the Celestial pieces in your build. Here's some info: http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1tawyu/psa_the_order_to_add_ascended_celestial_gear_for/

tl;dr: Celestial is great on most Armor + Weapons, not so good for Jewelry. Those stats are for Ascended, but they're fairly close to the Exotic stats.

Here's an alternate version: 

http://gw2skills.net/editor/?fEEQJAoYlEGCO2cQ5Af9AA5hLmwiowDlH5MjNA-jUDBoeBkEBgKAM5bQjJQJtMMsVXBp8KaqaBRvATXK1qYQeDa1SBonyI-w

The alternate version I would replace the Celestial Ascended Jewelry (and Exotic, as you upgrade) with some form of Crit Damage Jewelry. That means, Cavalier / Berserker / BerserkerValk are all good choices. That will lower your overall health a bit but improve your Toughness and offensive stats by a large amount.

Here's what I run solo/small scale:

http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?fEAQJAoYhMmkbwx5gjDAkHuYCLiCPUekzM2A-jEEBYgAYjgkIgUBAJfCiZPKrlhRs6KZlXBVbDT5CV7CWFTIyIGzaeI1G0QyAoPGA-w

Note that all Ascended Jewelry has Critical Damage on it and that none of it is Celestial. Also, the ""Regen when crit"" trait is very good when running solo, but I'm too lazy to change it."

Hopefully in a few years you'll realize that you weren't as mature as you thought you were at 16. After high school, it's about you and virtually 0% your friends. After I graduated, I was still immature according to myself now, but myself then was then was mature. After freshmen year of college is when I believe I realized that I needed to grow the fuck up. I had no money, hardly any plans, and so did most of my high school ""friends"". My close friends were and still are in the military. One got deployed to Afghanistan a few months into college and I'm not sure when or if I'll ever see him again. My other friend joined the navy after his freshmen year of college and he's been successful with his life. Maturity is not about intelligence or even so much as to how you act in comparison to other people.

Sir_Fancy_Pants,AskReddit,1389014072.0,"I was in the Choir and my Choir master asked me to stay behind one evening to help work out which hymns we were going to perform at the upcoming harvest festival.

He started asking me about girlfriends and how i felt about girls and women and if i was seeing anyone in school (i was only 11), he was a very community based man, who was always trying to do good or be seen as trying to do good, and apparently was helping loads of other students through issues and personal dilema's etc.

Anyway after a long chat about love and girls and how it related to Christ he said he wanted to show me something that would help me realise gods love and experience to new level, i was confused but curious. 

He lead me into a small room in the church used for storing church plates and books etc (i think it was his study), everyone had gone home by now and it was dark and I was rather scared, he opened the door and showed me something that instantly changed my life.

If was his daughter! , she was also my age and had a huge crush on me, he asked if i was interested in hanging out and dating her, which i did, 10 years later we married and i had consensual intercourse with her, where i lost my virginity.

Tuala08,AskWomen,1389014133.0,"There is a big difference between what I do for the day and what I do for a night out.  
I go to university and I value my sleep much more than how I look everyday so most days it's shower, brush teeth, lip balm, deodorant, whatever clothes seem acceptably clean and leave.  If I happen to have woken up a bit earlier naturally, I might comb my hair, put on a little under eye concealer and mascara but nothing else. 
That being said, I do lots of other stuff to maintain a good fresh face so I do not have to do lots of makeup, at night I will moisturize and I sometime put masques in my hair so I don't have to brush it everyday.  
A night out is different and since it does take so much work, I don't really enjoy going 'out'.

silverionmox,philosophy,1389014201.0,"&gt;That's the method; not the subject. The scientific method is rigorous. The subject, however, is not ""rigidly limited"" as it includes just about the entire universe.

But not at once, that would be like saying ""there is breathable air on planet earth, therefore I there's breathable air everywhere"".

&gt;Which is why you have people making things up as they go along.

For example ""nothing but material reality exists"".

&gt;So science has nothing to say about the nature of reality, because it can't answer an incoherent question? The reason science doesn't answer ""why"", is because ""why"" is a question that requires purpose, and there's no reason to believe that the universe has a purpose. There is, however, a reason why humans feel the need to ask ""why"", but that's completely understandable from the materialist position.

It's easy to claim universality if you can dismiss questions you don't like because they don't fit in your framework."

If one of the wildcards this year makes it to the superbowl and looses, that percentage drops to 66%. When a single result changes the percentage so much, your data universe is too small to be meaningful.

If your example went to court and you told teh truth you would be prosecuted, because unlike a stranger in the car, you knew this man gave him a lift, and struck him because he repeatedly asked or demanded your passport, your got out your car and challenged him.

all these things point to the fact it was not self defence.

icicle_,MakeupAddiction,1389014639.0,"Review: 
Note: The first photo is taken with natural light, second two are artificial. Colours are MUCH more shimmery IRL!

I ordered this palette online for I think around $12.00 AUD plus $3.10 shipping from the Sleek website in early November.. and can I just say I am very impressed with the pigmentation for a $12 palette! 

Originally I was tossing up between a few similarly themed palettes, however decided it would be much more friendly for my uni-student lifestyle if I bought this one... No regrets. The colours in the pan are fairly pigmented, the formulas for the shadows are SO soft, minimal fallout and colour payoff is wonderful especially for the shimmers. The one thing I kinda disliked was how the blues were a bit duller in real life than in the pan. However may have just been the base I used."

I dug up some dirt on some of the girls and confronted them with it. Caused them to cry and break down in the middle of the school yard. They left me the fuck alone after that.

The attempts at bullying kept coming as the years went by, but it wasn't bullying anymore as it was teasing. The 'popular' kids used me as some sort of vent when they needed to blow of some steam. They knew I didn't give a fucking shit about what they said or thought about me, so when they felt like it, they'd just throw insults at me, which would be quickly met with comebacks that were usually better than whatever the fuck they sent my way to begin with.

Cykuta,movies,1389014729.0,"I think the whole point of the ""method"" is that it works for the people who use it. I don't think they go method because of some philosophical views or because they think they will get a higher salary if they do (ok, maybe they actually do *that*, I dunno) or to brag. I think it's just a way for them to get the best job done.

Richard Armitage describes himself as a method actor, but he doesn't pretend it makes him somehow better than the people who don't do it. On the contrary, he once said that method acting is ""cheating"", because if he makes himself believe he is the character, all the elements click into place naturally, whereas if you are ""just"" acting, it's a conscious effort to portray a character. He also said that it's kept him apart on sets (as Thorin, who's broody and detached, or as Guy of Gisborne who's a miserable psycho) and he got an undeserved reputation for being antisocial. I think if he could act as good as he can without those side effects, he wouldn't have bothered with ""method acting."""

Think of Madoff or the Albanian pyramid scheme of the 90s - many people did really well there too and made millions. But the vast majority lost everything.

I don't agree with it. The woman would be in the same situation if she'd gotten knocked up by a guy she'd never see again, so it's obviously not a ""right"" for a child to have two paying parents, nor is it fair to put that burden on a man who has nothing to do with it.

Well, we kept the guns up on a shelf just above shoulder height, above a table that has two assembly areas (one on each side). We usually had a few spare canisters of the sauce for when rush hour hit stored next to the guns, when one time I was reaching up to go grab a canister with someone else working on the other side.

I accidentally tipped one of his spare canisters over while grabbing mine (it was mayonnaise, aka. ""McChicken Sauce""), when it fell on his hand just at the right time when he was reaching up for a spare canister. He knocked it backwards, behind him, in a quick reflex deflection, causing the sealed, slightly pressurised container of mayo to land in the 450 degree deep fryer.

It almost instantly exploded, sending mayo all over the place, including on the faces of some of the girls working the ""Fry Station"", and one girl working cash.

&gt;Do you think the fifth of the world's population living in absolute poverty would accept a massive economic slowdown so as to let a bunch of rich white people feel good about ""saving the planet""? No way in hell.

That poor fifth didn't have a say in the decisions to begin with, or they wouldn't be poor. Secondly, they'll be the biggest victims of drought and reduced crop yields if we do get the climate disturbance we're begging for, so I'd quit trying to wave the issue aways as a feelgood project if I were you.

&gt;What do you mean by this? Nuclear power is still far from being fully developed, Generation IV reactor designs show massive promise.

Just like fusion. They said that would be ready by the year 2000 too, and what happened? We can't rely on promises anymore. Nuclear has been lavishly funded in the last decades. At least give renewables the same funding and let them catch up, and let the best win. I'll bet there'll be solar panels on half the roofs of the planet before we've got a workhorse generation IV reactor.

cawkstrangla,AskMen,1389015792.0,"Reasonable context would be someone relating a story where they were called a bitch or a cunt.  I've seen posts be deleted because of that.  Yet, a week or so ago, when I followed a crosspost from /r/Askwomen that was on here, there was blatant use of calling people dicks.  Apparently it is ok when the male gendered slurs are used.  You'll probably come back and say something along the lines of ""dick"" being common language or that it doesn't put men down the same way ""cunt"" does for a woman.  If that is your guideline, then maybe you should ban the word ""creep"" because labeling a guy as a ""creep"" is just as damaging as calling a girl a ""cunt"".

What it comes down to, and why I unsubbed, is that the moderation style on /r/Askwomen made the sub feel artificial.  I went there looking for real answers and free conversation from and amongst women.  The vast majority of women I have met in real life, even those who are normally PC Feminists, don't shy away from people who use gendered slurs.  When I talk to them in a group, they don't all magically seem to come up with the most PC, feel-good, answers to questions.  This is what it feels like browsing that subreddit, and I can't help but think that part of that is because controversial language and beliefs are censored by the moderation.  Hell, there have been guys who unsubbed or who were banned for just arguing/debating women's opinions on there.  That is absurd.  Is no one allowed to feel uncomfortable or made to question their beliefs anymore?

I'm sure as a moderator you have heard these arguments 1000 times from this sub and elsewhere and have no intention to change, so whatever."

I volunteer at a local low-income middle and high school, teaching graphic and web design to kids in an after school program. We partner with local companies to help them build up their portfolios, get laptops into the hands of those who need it most, and eventually apply for scholarships and internships when they're old enough. Its not earth shattering, but a lot of these kids wouldnt otherwise have these kinds of opportunities and they are all just so awesomely eager to learn. One of the kids I worked with last year will be graduating in June and has been offered a job with the design company we helped him get an internship with. These are kids whose families likely wouldn't be able to afford college and many don't have computers at home, so this is huge. I'm so, so proud of him. 

I certainly wouldnt be doing these kids any favors with your defeatist attitude -- they've been hammered with the idea that the world is against them and that they'll never get out of the projects, because so many around them got trapped in the same cycle -- teen pregnancy, drugs, absent parents, etc. Terrible shit occurs everywhere, every day.

screenmagnet,sex,1389016095.0,"Drink a TON of water right after sex. Like 2L. Drink so much that is feels uncomfortable. Then pee it all out. In theory this should flush out the bacteria. What I do is sit on the toilet with a giant bottle of water and drink and pee at the same time (you need to drink it relatively quickly).

Clean your vulva and his penis/balls and all hands both before and after sex. You can even use chlorhexidine or iodine wipes before and after to disinfect, if you want to go the extra mile. In theory this will reduce the amount of bacteria on your and his skin. Sex-related UTIs are caused when the friction pushes bacteria on the skin up the urethra. So reducing the amount of bacteria on the skin should in theory help.

If that doesn't work, you may need post-coital antibiotic prophylaxis. Basically you take a single dose of an antibiotic right after you have sex. This works very well, but obviously you will need to see your doctor for this.

I am like you, trying every preventative measure under the sun without success. But I would still get UTIs basically every time I had sex (which meant I basically always had a UTI). The only thing that helped me was antibiotic prophylaxis.

Other things you can try: daily cranberry extract pills (helps make your urethra less 'sticky' for bacteria). Daily vitamin C to acidify your urine.

First, talk to your partner in a non-sexual context, letting him know that you feel like you never initiate and that you want to, but you're not sure how (or that you're shy and not ready to all out initiate). 

1) Explain to him that when you light this one particular candle, that it means you want to get it on and that you'd feel better if he initiated from there. Then he'd know you're in the mood and could get things rolling from there.

2) Kiss his neck and run a hand over his chest/shoulders. (It works for me.) Or something similar that your SO seemingly enjoys.

3) Sit on his lap and kiss him. I don't mean give him a little peck, I mean make out with him.

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389016714.0,"Profoundly.  My father was very much a larger-than-life figure who really embodied the best and worst of traditional masculinity, and growing up in his shadow in a world that was asking men to redefine masculinity was...interesting.

My dad was upper middle class, white, blond, blue eyed, 6'2"", and both handsome and charismatic.  His father was a captain in the Army and later a defense contractor, his mother was an heiress.  He grew up in Texas and Germany, and was a star football player who went to college on a football scholarship.  In 1963, at the age of 18, he was everything a man was expected to be in American society.  He was a literal poster boy for the All American Male, and the world was handed to him on a plate.  His life seemed perfect.

There were problems hiding under the surface however.  His parents hated each other -- they had been married just before granddad shipped off for WW2, where he fell in love with another woman. Grandmother refused to allow him a divorce, and had my father to force my grandfather to stay.  She resented and hated her own son as a result, and was an emotionally abusive narcissist who was incapable of love.

Grandfather, on the other hand, took his patriotism to nigh fanatical levels and was obsessed with the family's military traditions -- the Depression had ruined his family, lead his father to commit suicide, and the military had been his salvation and lead him to the promised life.  Service against the Nazi Menace had only cemented his belief that American military power was the most noble force for good in the world. With no hope of having his mother's love, my father was driven to earn and keep his father's affection -- the only emotional support he was given.

When the Vietnam war began, my father dropped out of college and enlisted.  As a model of American masculinity, he was able to write his own ticket and choose his own career path.  Driven to please his father and excel, he pursued the most difficult path he could -- Airborne Rangers into the Green Berets.

But Vietnam wasn't like World War 2, and his experiences were a far cry from what his father had lead him to believe war was.  He was subjected to psychological experiments designed to unleash killer instincts, he was recruited into CIA wetworks missions that involved violations of international law and gave him a terrifying close look at how international realpolitik works.  He murdered people and was nearly killed multiple times.  He developed intense post-traumatic stress.

Upon returning to civilian life, he turned to a life of crime and became a cat burglar.  He began drinking heavily.  He got caught, but due to his record of exemplary service and great lawyer walked away with probation.  Desiring to retreat for civilization, he went to work with the Park Service, but with his criminal record could never graduate to full time ranger.  feeling defeated, he returned to the private sector.  

He met my mom, tried to settle down.  Family life didn't suit him, he couldn't control his drinking or violence, and so he fell back into working for the CIA as an undercover operative in Africa.  My parents divorced.  A few years later he married an heiress, and effectively retired to live off her money and drink.

And I grew up in the shadow of all that. It was...strange.  In one way it was quite liberating, because it was obvious at a very young age that I was **never** going to be as macho as my dad.  There was zero chance of ever measuring up against that. I mean fuck -- He took a fucking knife to the throat and lived!  You don't top that.  That's a game-winning card in any contest of manliness.

More than that though, everyone perceived my father as the model of masculinity, even after the war.  he was still a handsome, charismatic man who could tell hilarious stories and make new friends easily.  People loved him.  Women wanted to be with him, men wanted to be him.  But they didn't see the other side that I saw, the black hole of self-hatred and existential despair that came from wearing his human face and pretending he wasn't the monster that the war had shown him was his real face.  So I knew it was an illusion, that being a Manly Man wasn't the win condition for life.

It's why I've always refused to be a man on anyone's terms but my own, and why I feel totally secure in my masculinity even though I'm into tons of ""unmasculine"" things (just get me talking about fashion or interior decorating sometime).  Because it was just obvious to me that being a macho, ultra-masculine dude does not make you happy.  And I want to be happy.

But yeah, my relationship with my father has helped to define my life in many ways.  Like anyone who recognizes my username from these forums probably knows me as a guy who talks shit about feminism a lot; well I got into feminism originally in the hopes that it would help me understand my dad -- back in the late 80s, it often seemed feminists were the only people talking about domestic violence.  And it was the complete inability of feminism to explain why my dad beat up my mother and I that first caused me to question feminism (my dad didn't beat us up because he hated women and kids, he beat us up because *he hated himself*).

It also profoundly affected my relationships with women.  My dad was not a good role model for how to be a man in a relationship, not with the constantly getting drunk and lashing out violently.  And he never really had any advice for me; when we talked about relationships, it was mostly just him expressing his deep sense of failure as a man and father because he couldn't not be abusive.  No surprise I turned out to be a white-knighting male feminist who put women on a pedestal in my youth.

**TL;DR:** Yes."

Bonus: alcohol dries FAST so you don't have to wait around long to let them dry! It can dry out your brushes, though, but I think it's totally worth it. As for the old/unsanitary- all makeup has an expiration date on them that states how long its good FROM OPENING. So if you have blush for 6 years but never broke the seal it's good. But if you opened it it says something like ""6M"", which means 6 months, with a pic of a compact next to it (it's really small, but its there). That's how long you have before you need to throw it away. Of course, I use some things longer (blush, powder) past the date because I'm the only user.

aren't vocational positions easy to replace by machines that have significantly better efficiency, productivity and reliability ? 

don't vocational sectors have an increased specialisation entrance point that makes changing jobs difficult?

aren't industrial positions on the decline for the last 200-300 years?

Same with the nepotism. Some companies who still have the same leadership from when they were small act and function as if they're still small where nepotism has any benefit.  Once they're medium to large the policies and behaviors of a small company really are an anchor.

cbslurp,nostalgia,1389016986.0,"&gt; At the same time, I don't see the kind of childhood attachment and nostalgia 90s kids exhibit out of older folks who grew up in the 80s, 70s etc. I take it this may just be my subjective take on this type of thing.

My guess is that eighties and nineties kids were extremely, extremely heavily marketed toward in comparison to previous generations, so we have more iconography to point at and go ""awww yeaaah"" to each other about.  For example, nostalgia based on ""oh man I remember teenage mutant ninja turtles and i'm thinking about that because they're making new movies and video games oh also Dunkaroos existed"" seems a lot easier to refer to specifically and have triggered than ""hey Muriel remember playing with sticks and eating sandwiches.""  Of course if you somehow made Muriel's Childhood Sandwich and set it in front of her, she'd be awash with nostalgia, but that's a personal thing that's harder to reminisce specifically about with others than, say, those hideous desert pizza Lunchables.  

I think it's a combination of specificity and marketing.  All of our shit was named and standardized and presented loudly and regularly as The Best Thing On Earth, and so we remember the names and the associated feelings and can easily bring them up and share in that nostalgia."

One of their team's students finds being at a moderate distance from the wall, and setting the power to hit the top of the ball's arc behind the scoring wall, give lots of ""wiggle room"" in terms of power and distance required to keep scoring into the top goal.

They did it out of purely racist reasons. Nothing more, nothing less. Stop pretending you know anything about bullying and stop being an apologetic asshole.

I also never bullied them. Bullying implies recurring patterns, that never happened with me. I was just fed up with their stupid shit one day, discovered some dirt on all of them and went to town the next time they picked on me. The spearhead of the bullies were 3 girls, and I targeted them one time. I threw all the shit I knew about them in their face, for all their friends and the bystanders to hear. They started crying on the spot and ran away to the girls bathroom. All 3 of them got into a severe depression and changed schools the next year.

I didn't adapt myself. I just got tired of their retarded shit and broke them. Also because they mainly picked on my brother.

Also, the 'bullying' never stopped after that. Other people still picked on me. But like I said, it wasn't anything severe, and it didn't bother me. They knew I was strong enough to withstand their stupid shit, so they kept throwing it at me.

I agree with you stating that Bronies are not the equivalent of in the closet paedophiles, but there must be some sort of psychological link between those that fixate on a show which is for children and their potential sexual fantasies (Yes I enjoy some kids shows myself but I do not decorate my life to express how much that show is a part of my life) I think it is eerily weird to the extent of which the ""Bronies"" obsess and defend a show which was intended to be nothing more than a bit of friendly entertainment for little girls. 

But that might be where the problem lies. If it was or is intended for little girls and big boys are watching it, is it our society that are judging these guys for fetishising this show because they're males interested in something for females?

cawkstrangla,AskMen,1389017843.0,"Well you can ignore this comment, because I'm not going to bother to go back and look for the thread from a week or so ago.  However I am 100% sure, that there was blatant use of ""dick"" as an insult, not deleted,  in the same thread where there were deleted comments with mod messages under them explaining they were deleted due to gendered slurs (I am going to assume they were female gendered slurs).  

I remember this because I hadn't really browsed through the sub in a while, and followed a cross post from here.  When I noticed that, I made a conscious note of the hypocrisy to reaffirm why I unsubbed, and went on with my browsing.  Maybe those posts were deleted later on, I doubt it because it was an older thread, but maybe.

In the end it doesn't matter.  I don't care enough about an internet forum to lobby it's moderators to change their style of moderation.

Necron_Overlord,Feminism,1389018271.0,"&gt;I don't think rape jokes have necessarily been increasing. They are becoming more transgressive because attitudes to it have changed. That is not the same thing.

I was really confused by this comment at first, but I think I've just had an insight that clarifies something for me that I've been very confused about.

I think there is a very real difference between rape jokes that assume rape is funny, such as the example you gave from the sitcom, and rape jokes that assume rape is terrible.  That is, there is a difference between *rape as comedy* and *rape as black comedy*.

I've never understood the reddit feminist community's complaints about rape jokes on reddit, because the jokes are always clearly in the vein of black comedy and those making the jokes and those laughing at the jokes understand that this is very dark humor and that rape is actually quite terrible.

But now I get it.  You (by which I mean the community in general) don't see the difference between comedy and black comedy, so you attempt to suppress both, but the arguments that you make against *rape as comedy* don't make sense to people who are treating rape as black comedy.

That really explains a lot of the fights that break out around this topic."
i_lick_telephones,AskWomen,1389018277.0,"Sure, let me list some that I really enjoyed that are on Netflix:

**A Place at the Table**--This is a favorite of mine. It discusses poverty and hunger in the United States. It's very poignant, and it really makes me cry. Bonus: Jeff Bridges does a lot of the commentary in it. I highly recommend it, I've seen it 3 times now.

**Miss Representation**--Talks about media portrayal of women. I watched this one with my boyfriend, and he really got a lot out of it and took a lot of the issues discussed to heart, even though he's not a woman. 

**Unborn in the USA**--A documentary discussing abortion positions and the arguments used. It's a lot of just raw footage; not a lot of commentary. It really forces the viewer to figure it out themselves how they feel, which made me a bit confused, because I was expecting the documentary to take a position when it never did. It just showed both sides. It made me cry, it made me upset, and it made me angry. I'd give it a watch if you can. Though looking at the wiki for it now, it *seems* like it was made as a documentary to show pro-life activists ""winning"" the war on abortion. Which might explain why it instilled such emotions in me!

**Jesus Camp**--I like it but goddamn is it something else. Just look it up if you haven't seen already.

**The Interrupters**--Gang violence in Chicago and a group set out to stop it.

Those are just the ones that stick out in my head. If you're looking for a certain genre in a documentary, I'm sure I could help you out.

Some ones to avoid (in my opinion):

**Religulous**--I'm an atheist, and I generally like Bill Maher but this is just not-so-subtle bullying caught on film. Funny parts, and some parts make you see the stupidity of some things and the ignorance in some, but it doesn't sit right with me, seeking out religious people just to patronize and mock them.

**Hungry for a Change**--It's like a vegan/health food documentary but it seems incredibly loaded.

I also really, really enjoy documentaries on drugs, criminality, prison systems, the structure of our criminal justice system, etc., but find PBS Frontline is better for that kind of thing. If you're looking for something in that direction, I have a few I can recommend. "

And I've only just realised that this is not being posted in r/minecraft. A little bit of faith restored for that community there then. Either way, the two guys on this are megacunts."
GeoffreyArnold,short,1389018398.0,"This makes perfect sense. But, I was talking about a mindset and not necessarily mere attraction. Also, your example is different than having a future with someone and perhaps having children with them.  So, what if she said ""I don't date Jews"", and luckily you're not Jewish. Well, that's O.K. From an attraction standpoint. But, it would also be OK for you not to want to have kids with her or enter into a long term thing with her because you two don't share the same values about Jews, even though you're not Jewish. 

I'm just saying, a woman who harbors noxious views about short people isn't the person I'd want to hang around for long, even if I met her height requirement. We wouldn't share the same values.  That's not to say I wouldn't be attracted to her and want to have sex. But nothing long-term. "

he is poz, so i'm sure he's had this happen before (thus the reason he may not have disclosed up to that point.) however, don't let the fact that he is positive keep you from having a relationship if you think he is someone you can have a relationship with. best of luck."

Get a MyFitnessPal to track your food intake every day. It helps a ton when you're starting out to see your macros. As you continue, it helps count your calories. 

As far as photos - good call. I take my weight, measurements and progress photos every Saturday morning. It really is quite the motivation.

As for bread - you learn not to miss it. And, if you do, look into Flatout Light flatbreads. Only 7net carbs, so you can make an occasional 'sandwich' when you're really craving one. I make a bacon, egg and cheese wrap or use it as a hamburger bun maybe once a week. The Italian kind is also really good as a pizza crust. Just load that thing with reduced sugar tomato sauce and a ton of meat and cheese.

You will wake up one morning in a week or two, go to log into Reddit, see your replies to this troll account... and suddenly those replies wont give you the satisfaction they used to. You'll look up in the mirror whilst brushing your teeth, and see those empty eyes staring back... nothing makes you feel anything any more, not even intentionally riling people up on the internet.

As you spit toothpaste residue into the sink, your head will lull for a second longer than it should, as you close your eyes and wish you had anything in your life worth living for... a job you're passionate about, a lover to keep you warm... hell, even a friend who understood why you do what you do.

You'll wash the spots of toothpaste off you hands, and regrettably slide over to your dirty PC desk, covered in the remnants of last nights meal. You'll glumly recall the minor satisfaction you had after a heated 10-minute troll session with some poor kid... as you tab open /r/gonewild and start jerking off to pictures of girls you dream about making laugh, making smile. But those girls don't look at you like you look at them. They don't see you at all, and when they do... they quickly look away, or nervously laugh you off.

As you cum into an empty crisp packet, you'll feel something... an immense wave of sadness wash over you. Why didn't you study harder? You could have been a doctor! Why didn't you listen to your parents? They only tried their best. Why did you say that thing to that girl? She could have been the one!

No job, no friends, no partner... hell, even Breaking Bad is off the air now. You tab open your many failed troll accounts via RES, and the cycle begins again. Bring on the downvotes, internet! I want them! I want you to hate me, because to hate me is to recognise me, to see me! Your mild annoyance at my actions are themselves an act of recognition!

beefcakez,naturalbodybuilding,1389019037.0,"Just a little help. I use it when I'm planning my contest preps so I can generally calculate how long I should cut based on an average fat loss per week. 

**Anyway, if you don't want to click the link here's the formula:**

* Lean Body Mass = Your Body Weight – (Your Body Weight x Your Current Body Fat Percentage)

* Goal Body Weight = Lean Body Mass/(1 – Desired Body Fat Percentage)

**Example**

Current stats: 185 lbs @ 17% bf

LBM = 185 lbs - (185 x 0.17) = 153.55 lbs

We'll assume a goal of 9% bodyfat 

Goal BodyWeight (@9% bf) = 153.55 lbs/(1-.09) = **168.7 lbs**

So, you need to lose (185-168.7) = 16.3 lbs of bodyfat (whilst retaining all your lean mass) to hit your target. 

Assuming 1.5 lbs/week of fat loss (between 1.0-2.0 lbs/week max), that means:

16.3 lbs/1.5 lbs/week = ~11 weeks of prep

However, at the end of this, you probably won't exactly weigh 168.7 lbs, but this gives you a good baseline to start from.

I feel for you man. I was in this situation not even a month ago, minus the snooping her messages part; I just confronted her after seeing her snapchat top favorite was her old fuck buddy she'd already agreed not to have any contact with.

Last night, I found an email I had received from his ex-wife about a year after we started dating, wherein she described a few things she hopes he is able to overcome in his relationship with me. (""Hope he is less stubborn, hope he is more affectionate,"" etc.) 

It made me realize that the things we were fighting about two weeks ago are the same damn things he fought with his wife about ten years ago. 

People don't change unless they WANT to change. You give him absolutely no incentive by staying in the relationship. 

You need to stand up for yourself and leave. If you matter enough to him, he will take the initiative and seek counseling for his destructive communication habits, or ask you to seek counseling together. By staying, you eliminate all the consequences of his behavior. Sure, you're mad after a fight, but you're still there, so why should he have to do anything differently? 

You deserve respect. Whether he chooses to respect you or someone else chooses to respect you in a relationship, you deserve nothing less than absolute respect. Your fiancé is incredibly disrespectful. "

holliewood,MakeupAddiction,1389019390.0,"You can definitely pull off blush, even with redness! With your current foundation routine, I'm sure you cover enough of your natural redness that you can add some back to your skin selectively. You've just got to give it a shot! I always thought that blush was unnecessary until I really started trying it out. It really can make a big difference! And again, it's easier to pull off than you would think. I'm pale with dark brunette hair like you, and I tend to go for shades such as peach, mauve, and rosey pinks -- I tend to stay away from stark reds and dark plums. But no matter what shade I use, I always apply it with a light hand so that I can build it if I want more color. Dip a brush in the powder (or you could even opt for a cream! Those can be especially nice and forgiving on pale skin), buff it on the cheekbones and you're good to go-- Easy peasy! :)

As for contour, personally, I just go for whatever shade looks right. Like if it's marketed as a blush or eyeshadow or whatever, so what! If it looks similar to the shade you're after, grab it. For whatever reason, it's hard to find products marketed specifically for contouring. Blushes are usually too pink, bronzers are usually too orange and shimmery. So sometimes it's easiest to think outside of the box and look in different sections for the color/type of product you're looking for..if that makes any sense? I know E.L.F's studio line has a nice blush/contour duo, but that might be hard to find in stores too. Hm, maybe try looking at Revlon, Wet n' Wild, or NYC? I know I've seen some decent pressed powders (labelled as a blush or bronzer) within these brands that should work! This is probably largely unhelpful, but the point is that contour colors are actually pretty easy to find/use, so don't feel constricted to using NYX Taupe! Like blush, contour colors are actually a lot more easy to use and blend than one would think. A lot of people use shades MUCH darker than their foundation and it still ends up looking awesome. So don't be afraid to experiment! You might even have something currently on hand that you can try!"

I told him in detail everything wrong with that comment: how he was giving our friend an excuse to not take my feelings into account even more, how he was discrediting me/my gender and how the whole thing was generally extremely sexist (there was more, but I've forgotten most of it). After which, he sat down and apologised for the comment he made, while working through with himself why it was wrong and understanding the problem, rather than just reacting to how I felt. 

So yeah, it's a lovely thing to know about one's SO. Keep having those sorts of conversations!"

myrrlyn,teslore,1389019670.0,"&gt;However, I plan to make the main character an Orc

You, my dear, have made an excellent choice. :D

1. ~60 years. Malacath as Orkey cursed men with short lives (previously men lived as Elves did) and Shor got pissed and made sure to include the Orcs in the curse as well. MY OWN HYPOTHESIS: Orcs mature rapidly by necessity and are considered adults in their middle teens.

2. I believe that Orcs have a small malus to raw intellect, however, they still have their intellectuals (CoW librarian) and fools just as every group distribution does. That said, alchemy is a trade practiced in the Strongholds and therefore something that most Orcs know in some level. I would say that they are best at learning smithing, alchemy, and fighting, and somewhat slower at picking up ""finer"" subjects.

3. Orcs are expected to leave the Stronghold for a time to prove themselves against the world; however, the Chief-line children are expected to return, since the Stronghold will have use for them. A Chief-son leaving on his own and not returning would likely cause a disownment (certainly ugly feelings), but full banishment-on-pain-of-death from a Stronghold is rare. 

4. I would very much hope so, but the in-game examples re: player character are disappointing. That said, Nords tend to be highly meritocratic and Nords and Orcs are well matched in terms of physical prowess and the Nords certainly respect their metalwork: ""Orcish gear, eh? Strong but ugly, like them that made it.""

5. [Yes, actually. I wrote one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1mw7f5/on_orsimeri_family_life/) Other than that, I can't think of any. Cross-racial mixing with Orcs is by no means forbidden, though it tends to have stigmas (especially for humans in the Iliac region). I tend to write Orcs as being highly sexual (after all, they are a very physical culture) and have them treat sex with more or less the same codes of ethics that they treat fighting. If you fight with everyone you meet you're an ass, and if you sleep with everyone you meet you're crass. So IMO an Orc/Dunmer pairing would actually be a great idea.

I'm more than happy to answer any further questions you have on the matter."

For example the scene where they're trying to break through the embassy all the muslim men who we're led to believe each have a back pack under their robes (The news and Hollywood has done that for us) and that they then stormed the embassy. Apparently there weren't even half as many as the film states and they were all young students?

Animals don't get existential crises. Animals don't philosophize on their place in the universe, or even know what an universe is. Animals don't understand the concept of illusion, delusion, culture or religion.

I have the feeling that you are a tad angry about this. You shouldn't. We are animals in the biological sense - but we are much, much more than animals in the intellectual, philosophical sense. Sure, we don't like to use the word ""animal"" to describe ourselves, but only because we tend to use it in a pejorative manner.

An ""animal"" wouldn't go through what you're going right now."

Medicaid won't care at all, and it'll probly be easier to keep it if he's not involved. When the baby's born, since you aren't married, if your state is like mine you will get a letter in the mail (or you can start the process yourself) asking if you want to go for child support. In my state it's called the child support enforcement agency. Fill out some paperwork and they will track dad down. If he agrees he's the father, bam, child support. If he denies paternity they will order a DNA test. If its his, he has to pay afterward. Not only will they order child support, even if he's never worked a day in his life, they will most likely order him to provide insurance for the child thru his job. If he is unemployed or his job won't offer it baby still gets Medicaid. My daughters bio whatever had never worked before CSE caught up with him. They didn't figure the amount based on his actual income, they based it on what an able bodied man of his age SHOULD be able to pay. If he doesn't pay for a long enough time they will garnish his wages if he has a job, take away his driver license, garnish bank account, put a lien on any property he owns such as house or car or boat. If none of that stuff works they will issue a warrant. Not the kind to where every cop is out searching, but the kind where if he happens to get pulled over he will sit I jail.

Yes this may be the case in the two quotes or so they managed to find. But people's main complaint of him since he's been at United is that he's too positive so I don't understand how it's relevant.


They're all too happy to say that Martinez is now getting the best out of his players because they're happy and have higher goals now. But it fails to mention that all the players they're praising, Barkley, Coleman, Baines, became the players they are because of the development given to them by **Moyes** not Martinez. It's just as easy to argue that Martinez is living off the work of Moyes.


It's also completely irrelevant for them to compare United struggling to Everton thriving. Moyes is trying to deal with the hangover of the greatest manager that lived retiring, and trying to get the club to work after that.  Martinez has taken over a ready made Everton side, with some astute/lucky loan signings from himself and made them play nice football, and because of teams like United and Spurs struggling Everton look in a better position than they were in last season, when in reality they're in the same place. 


It's also far too early to judge whether Martinez will be a selling manager like Moyes was. It's not his decision for a start, but just because he won't sell Barkley in January and made an inane statement about £50 million not being enough for a loan, people seem to think this means he won't sell any players. Well I need more evidence personally.

syberphunk,secretsanta,1389020647.0,"""so many people are jumping to the conclusion that they've been shafted""

There are two points here.

1. In cases there's zero communication from the SecretSanta
2. In some countries, it really doesn't take 3 weeks for a package to ship within the country.

For example in the UK, if you're sending a parcel or item of mail by first class. It doesn't take longer than 4 days to get to its destination.

At the time of the SecretSanta deadline for example, people should have received their gifts by the following Monday or at least soon after when the mail started up again.

So for the case of my friend, both my friend and their Secret Santa were in the UK, as the SS claimed they sent the parcel by Royal Mail.

""I plan to sign up for rematching, but I'm nervous I'll get matched to someone who couldn't wait 3 weeks for a package to ship around the holidays.""

Communication is the key here. The first thing you should do is tell your rematchee that this is the case.

There is also no (strict) deadline for sending out a parcel when you're re-matched.

Also, make sure that your giftee knows to say they've received the parcel from /you/ not their original Santa.

And, I think this should be a must to all parcels sent via SecretSanta, try to send it by some form of tracking or recorded delivery."

Anyway, one episode focused on a poultergeist, scared the hell out of me I can tell you.

One bit I especially remember, was that the woman of the house went into the bedroom to tell the kids off for running around, only for them to protest their innocence.

As she turned away, the heavy chest of drawers 'moved itself' in front of the door. The camera then zoomed into this womans face, and the look on her face scared the sweet bejesus out of me. (Oh come on, I was only about 8 at the time)

So anyway, I had nightmares for days, and finally admitted what had me so scared to my Dad. He promised me that he'd sort the ghosts out for me, and so I went to bed a little less scared than the night before. When I woke up, something had moved me and my brothers bunk beds into the middle of the room, without waking us!

I was suitably terrified for a long time, had nightmares for a good while, on and off.

It wasn't until my 14th/15th birthday when the family were all sat round reminiscing, that my eldest brother laughed and said ""Hey, remember the time we all moved Nathan's bed to scare him?""

Was not best pleased I can tell you. Turned out that my Dad had tucked me into bed, then gone and told the other 5 kids of his great idea, and as a family activity had decided to move my bed, then after it was done sent my brother to bed in his bunk.

dunnoyabassa,INTP,1389020846.0,"&gt;I'm too immature for that kind of relationship.

The way this kind of thing goes away is through having relationships.  I don't personally see this as a valid reason to avoid any kind of relationship, because it will ensure the self-defeating quality NEVER goes away.

that said, i dated my ex's best friend the summer before we both went off to separate colleges hundreds of miles apart.  it ended poorly, but i met my fiance a month after the break up.

moral of the story:  you won't learn to be mature enough to handle complicated relationships if you constantly avoid them.  all things considered, this does sound like a challenging relationship to keep permanently, but if you're as open and honest as possible (""hey INFJ, my feelings for you are almost at Biblical magnitudes, however I'm worried our relationship could fail because xyz"") and if the two of you communicate well, you might choose to view this potentially impermanent relationships as an opportunity to succeed and learn instead of an opportunity to fail and be hurt."

Cygnus_X,Bitcoin,1389020943.0,"I read about Bitcoin either late in 2009 or early 2010.  I thought it would be awesome to get a few while they were dirt cheap in hopes they would one day become valuable, although, at the time, I knew nothing about it.  I installed the mining software blissfully unaware of what I was doing.  However, things turned when I actually started running the software.  The sound my PC started to make was cringe worthy.  I thought I had been tricked into setting up a spam mail server.  I figured my computer was sitting there sending out millions of viagra emails an hour, so I promptly uninstalled.  I was scared I had purposefully installed a virus.  Nothing really added up in my mind though as the software uninstalled so easily, but I soon forgot about it as my PC continued to work, and I moved on.

A few months after uninstalling, I read about a pizza being sold for Bitcoin.  I still didn't take the time to learn what Bitcoin was, and based on previous experiences, I just brushed over the news.  In my mind, a digital currency just wasn't feasible and this pizza was just a novelty purchase.  I had read you could generate an account ID while offline, and that was just too bizarre for me to conceive.  The idea, in my mind, was not practical, and would never take flight.

In September of 2012, I still didn't know what Bitcoin was, but I had read just enough over the years to know it was neat.  I was having difficulty with google's adwords, so I started running coinurl ads on my website.  It paid in BTC.  I soon gained my first full coin.  I figured if BTC really did take off, that 1 coin would be worth something.

In 2013, when the price hit $250, I was shocked.  The price escalation was just crazy.  This forced me to read further, and really began to open my mind about what Bitcoin is.

I had considered investing more in early 2013.  I remember distinctly speaking with a friend about investing $5K when the price was below $100.  But, when I read silk road was being shut down and that the owner's BTC funds were seized, it made me nervous.  I couldn't predict how this would effect future pricing, so I continued running ads, but never really bought in.  Also, market cap at that time was 100M, which I just couldn't justify.  

It wasn't until late 2013 when the price spiked again, and I read BTC could be converted into USD for a 1% fee, and I realized that the market cap was only 1/15 the size of facebook that I decided to really put some funds into it.  Looking back, I wish I had read more before reaching any of the conclusions that I had.  Moving forward, I can easily see a 150B market cap within the next few years.

myrrlyn,teslore,1389020982.0,"&gt;  If there were multiple sons, would they have to fight amongst themselves for the right to challenge their father?

[I actually wrote a piece that touched on this as well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1u4b55/mortal/) One does not necessarily need to kill their father, should he die by other means, but allowing a Chief to die of old age is seen as disgraceful. Furthermore, the required patricide (or fratricide, if you're trying to cut in line) serves as a forge of character. Those who do it with respect and regret, but do it anyway because it is needed, but it is not a task in which one should take glee or disrespect the dead. Malacath would not be unduly upset about that.

Comment of the day goes to you, man. You do have a valid point. And yes, whilst you say you can't just call it pop, I agree. My point being that you can't just call it punk however in my previous comment I was hitting at my hatred towards it being referred to as pop-punk but to me, anything that gets into the Top 40 charts is pop. Makes no difference if it's House, Dubstep, Rock, Indie or whatever if you've been less than 20 chart positions away from a Lady Gaga or Niki Minge song then you're a pop act.

wittyb,electronic_cigarette,1389021059.0,"I'm curious to know what kind of tank you are vaping from, and if you're a ""tipper""? (Do you tip the e-cig much beyond vertical when inhaling.)

I've noticed that many tank style atomizers have a ""drip catching"" cup beneath the drip tip, designed to funnel condensation back into the tank as it accrues.  I could see this failing if you are a chain vaper, toking on the thing for a minute or more at a time, with a big draw.  This wouldn't allow the cup to function, as you would be constantly drawing the condensate back towards your mouth.

If your drip tip base is too long, it could encompass all of the volume in the condensate reservoir, causing the same symptoms.

I'd think about changing tips, see if you can find something that has a shorter length on the bottom, or is longer overall.  I'm shooting in the dark, though, since I don't know what you're vaping on."

Drunken_Black_Belt,AskReddit,1389021217.0,"Not a ""basic"" feature, but let me tell you the 18 month saga of beating a boss in Metal Gear Solid.

In Metal Gear Solid, there is a boss named Psycho Mantis. He is, as his name implies, psychic.  He reads your memory card, commenting on your saves and other games you have played.  He even make the controller ""move"" by using the rumble feature.  Cute tricks, but the one that will infuriate you forever is the fact that he uses his psychic ability to dodge damn near every attack you throw at him.  Bullets, grenades, kick and punches?  Maybe you'll catch him and chip off a small chunk of health.  Oh, and did I mention that he even makes your screen go blank at random points, making it look like you changed channels on your tv?  While you're fumbling around attempting to figure out how to get back to the game, he's there kicking your ass.

18 months.....

18 months it took me to beat him.  10 year old me loved the game, but rage quit so much, after SO many hours battling that bastard. I thought I sucked.  I thought the game cheated.  I thought it was maybe impossible to beat and the whole game was a joke.  So many times I came so close, only to get killed before I could land the last few hits.  It didn't help that I was constantly interrupted by the CODEC calls, beeping and flashing on screen with pointless information.

One day I beat him, I had done it.  I was so proud.  I went to school and told my friends.  And they laughed.  Oh how they laughed.  Turns out, when the screen goes blank, you're supposed to put your PS controller into slot #2, and then he wouldn't be able to read your mind....

I was crushed, defeated.  I didn't want to believe them.  So i went home, started a new save file that day, made my way to Mantis, and sure enough, my friends were right."

When I was younger(ninja edit:actually still now) when we would be in a social setting at a soccer party, family reunion,etc. my NDad would always say ""Tell Julie about how school is going."" or ""Tell Aunt Becky about that goal you scored last weekend."" always ""Tell X about Y."" And if I didn't tell the story the way he wanted me to, he would intervene with questions he already knew the answer to, just to get me to talk, like ""Didn't you score the goal with your left foot?"" So now I have no idea how to start conversations. I'm college it's a little easier because you have the easy questions that literally everybody starts with, What's your major? Where are you staying? Where did you live before here? But at my new internship people will come up to me and introduce themselves and I have no idea how to talk to them.

I also can't make eye contact. I've been friends with my best friend for 10 years and I can't even look her in the eyes when we talk.

I can't bring myself to talk on the phone either, if we order pizza I either do it online or my friend orders for us(it's awesome that she understands!).

LionelOu,AskHistorians,1389021466.0,"It's impossible to link these changes to any one specific person, or even a specific place. As with so many other changes it's more of a general shift. It depended on many different factors and changes in society. There have been countless attempts to explain why it happened and why at this specific time. 

For instance, the concept of magic was alive in the minds of people, even if the church denied its existence. In many places Christianity blended seamlessly with ""magic"" for the local people. Christianity dealt with ideas like the soul, death, and afterlife while local traditions dealt with the harvest, weather, and other such things. The concept of maleficarum, meaning dealing harm with magic, was alive in local courts. You needed proof of actual harm being done though, so in a sense it was more of a catch-all for dealing with trouble makers.

These were also the times of reformation and counter reformation and the catholic church was both trying to reign in heresy (as they saw it) and stamp out local pagan beliefs. Meanwhile protestants (and others) were busy trying to remove as much catholic influence as they could. 

Then you have a trend of centralization and of replacing local courts, headed by local people, with centrally educated law men. It moved a lot of the power and possibility of dealing with problems into the hands of ""outsiders"". In older times what might have been dealt with in terms of fines were moved to harsher punishments as deterrents.

There's also the problem with gender ratios. In the 15th-17th century Europe had several quite disruptive war. It shifted the gender ratios around when many of the local men were killed, meaning lots of unwed young women. On the other hand, some of the accused were well off, married women.

It also meant that rule of law broke down in certain areas. Many of the largest witch-hunts in Germany took place during the 30 years war, for instance.

Even such things as the invention of the printing press helped to form this climate, since it made it easier to distribute books and pamphlets with anti-witchcraft themes in them.

None of these were the sole reason for witch hunts to begin. They helped bring it about, in varying degrees. Some of them both helped form it and resolve it. The centralization of courts meant that actual evidence was needed for outrageous claims and some areas (such as England and Scandinavia) banned the use of torture. Which predictably meant that conviction rates plummeted. 

In the end, it's impossible to point to any one specific reason why. Even the reasons I listed here are disputed and debated. "

Anyway, I read an article a couple years ago regarding how the human eyes work and how we judge physiques based on the convex and concave surfaces they have. (I'll try to find it, but I'm at work now). 

Anyway, it basically goes to say that the eyes move from the shoulders downward to the hips. The greater the change, the more appealing it is. 

From a reproductive standpoint, this is desired because it has been shown that shoulders have high androgen receptor concentration and high testosterone causes shoulders to grow. 

So, wide and thick shoulders are an indication of high testosterone (hence why AAS users have massive delts). 

It's also a general saying that ""For every 1"" of width on the shoulders, your waist shrinks by 1"", and vice versa. This is only in a visual respect, not factual. Your waist *looks* like it's gotten smaller when you have wider shoulders, etc. 

Anyway, I've digressed from the point. Here's a good representation:

[Lee Labrada competed at 5'5'' (or 5'6'') weighing 175 lbs](http://www.ifbbcaribbean.com/images/LeeLabrada2.jpg) and was 2nd in the Mr. O competition 2-3 times! Note, there was no under-202 class back then. 

If you were to look at him by himself, he looks like he's comparable to guys like Yates who are much taller and weigh significantly more. He has huge shoulders and a narrow waist. 

It's all about how you build the physique. However, I believe this has been lost in modern bodybuilding. . . .  Again, I digress. . ..

There was no description of what we're seeing until several hours after being prompted. It was merely a poor picture posted without and explanation other than ""Zombie Apocalypse Remedy"", which is no description at all. Sometimes, even a junky photo with a great description can be meaningful.

You trot out an overused construct- the zombie apocalypse. Generally speaking, this sub is focused on ak47/74 and their various iterations and less on SHTF setups. It's a more (but not completely) serious sub. As mentioned by /u/Bristico, people are sorta fed up with that.

Necron_Overlord,Feminism,1389021799.0,"&gt;I don't think men who understand how often women face physically threatening situations forced by an overly persistent man do find these ""jokes"" funny.

I think it would be more accurate to say that men don't empathize with the outrage and offense that some feminists take at these jokes.  Given that these jokes tend to be the milieu of people who are generally pretty bitter about life, a lack of empathy is -- at the very least -- not shocking.

&gt;There are ways to joke about these things, but they involve ""punching up"" at those who abuse their power, not ""punching down"" at those who suffer the abuse.

I don't want to get into an argument on that topic in /r/Feminism because I like my karma, but suffice to say I think its easy to (mis)interpret that argument as being very self-righteous.  I know that I personally find it troubling how often I see this ""punching up/down"" argument being made by people who have no qualms about mocking overweight, unmasculine and low social status men who are subject to tremendous abuse from their peers (male and female) already.

It can be hard to tell if this line or argument is being made in good faith, or if its being made because it just happens to let you make fun of me, while I can't make fun of you.  That's a hard pill for me to swallow, and I hope you can understand that.

In basically every culture people are taught from a young age that if they are genetically related to someone,  then they should have a social relationship with that person. This is essentially pragmatism, if we take this statement at a purely logical level it's nonsense.

For the *vast* majority of people out there, this works on a practical level, and people end up with this idea embedded deep in their mental 'blueprint' of the world around them. The kind of people you see on this sub or websites like it are exceptions to this rule.

Note that if a rule works 95% of the time, being in the losing 5% doesn't mean you don't believe it. Many people who share their stories on this sub, for example, have spent years hating the way they're treated but accept it because the abuser was family. One of the most intellectually difficult processes is criticizing or analyzing your 'blueprint' of the world, since that 'blueprint' is also the lens you see everything through.

I think no matter what, you're going to have to make peace with the fact that there will be very few people who will approve of this decision. I'm only in my 20's but I'm convinced /u/Lungano is right, that it will be something you deal with for life. With individuals you have to make a decision to either challenge or not challenge their beliefs. If you don't challenge their beliefs on the matter you're going to just have to discount any advice which is based on those beliefs."

incogito_ergo,financialindependence,1389021869.0,"RE is the best performing asset class during periods of inflation, particularly when leveraged.  Stocks tend to more or less 'ignore' inflation  (i.e. a stock that returns 8% during periods of 2% inflation will return 10% during periods of 4% inflations).  As Enphuego said below, that's a gross oversimplification, but the stock market performs OK during inflationary periods.

FWIW the rule of thumb for an inflationary environment is that the best performing asset classes are (in order):

1) Real Estate

2) Commodities/Precious Metals

3) Equities

4) Bonds

5) Cash

(with bonds and cash possibly switching places based upon current interest rate trends... i.e. rising rates hammer bond prices)

One of the reasons I love RE so much is that the only environment it is not a top performer in is in the event of significant deflation (in which case it is undoubtedly the worst asset class to be in, particularly leveraged).  All signs indicate that the powers that be are going to keep printing money to ensure an inflationary environment, so long-term downside risk in RE is minimal when compared to other asset classes.

bryntheskits,gaming,1389021887.0,"&gt; DayZ is going to die while it languishes in 12 year old Arma2 engine

&gt;Are you implying that the tech they're using for this game isn't hopelessly archaic?

DayZ uses a highly modified version of the Real Virtuality 3 engine, what your saying is like saying the current Source engine is the same as the original one released a decade ago because it has the same name, and is highly misleading.

&gt;Rocket's been spending 2 years getting his shoe-degradation algorithm.

If you had actually been following anything to do with the standalone, you would know that they have rebuilt the server and client architecture from the ground up to be more suited for the MMO-style of gameplay needed for DayZ to work properly, which is why it is taking so long. Some of his developers being in jail overseas probably put a dent into plans as well.

&gt;As opposed to the insightful and informative rebuttal you just provided?

You and your views are highly bias towards this game and show you have done little to no research on your own accord, and because of that I don't even think anything I could say would get through to you, which is why I didn't even try in my previous post. In fact, anyone that has even the slightest idea about how the current standalone works would laugh in your face if you started spouting the bullshit you currently post, since you obviously know nothing about the game or it's current state, developmental or otherwise."

Que bien que no te arrestaron la neta, buena onda el gerente que no le importó porque si le hubiera pedido a los oficiales que te arrestaran para proteger su propiedad, y hubieran llevado el caso a una corte, hubieras estado encarcelado.

No estás pagando impuestos por ""negligencia"" e ""injusticia"" estás pagando impuestos porque los padres de México están tan poco educados que les compran a sus hijos todo tipo de comida chatarra a diario, y causan que nuestro país tenga de los peores casos de obesidad infantil y adulta a nivel mundial. Es más, es aquí en México donde todos y cada unos conocemos la llamada ""panza chelera"" por eso le subieron el impuesto a  la comida chatarra, y sólo a la comida chatarra, cito al periódico mural:

*Cabe señalar que también a partir de 1 de enero entró en vigor el nuevo Impuesto Especial Sobre Producción y Servicios (IEPS) de un peso al litro de bebidas saborizadas y azucaradas (refrescos); y de 8% a alimentos chatarra.*

*El IEPS también se aplicará a los jarabes, extractos, esencias y polvos que contengan cualquier tipo de azúcares añadidos y sirvan para preparar bebidas saborizadas. Mientras que el aplicado a comida chatarra grava dulces, confites, bombones, chocolates, nieves y helados.*

Y ahora de CNN México:

*La reforma grava con un Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios (IEPS) de 5% a los alimentos de alto contenido calórico como frituras, dulces, gelatinas o chocolates y de 10% a la enajenación e importación de algunos productos cuya ingesta se encuentra presuntamente relacionada con el sobrepeso y la obesidad.*

Ah, y se llama IEPS no IVA.

Deberíamos de preocuparnos por cosas más importantes, educación, salud, el problema del narcotráfico, decidir que vamos a hacer con la legalización de las drogas, derechos humanos fundamentales. Pero no, estamos atascados en tonterías infantiles de ""acción ciudadana"" y ""desobediencia civil"" creyéndonos los revolucionarios porque decidimos ser unos negligentes con el problema de la obesidad en México nosotros mismos. ¡Ay del que salga con una jalada como que la obesidad y diabetes en mexico son ficticias, o con que la [Nutella no es un alimento chatarra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Z6KzE3z-E) Neta, hacen quedar mal al país.

Los impuestos no son la solución, están mal, se debería de arreglar esto con educación, pero llevamos años ""educando"" y lo único que hemos logrado es que ahora que los maestros no trabajan, al menos la mayoría siga dando clases.

GeoffreyArnold,short,1389021999.0,"&gt;I don't think the jew example is very good because not liking jews would be caused by not being ok with something about their religion or a set of traits she attributed to all jews everywhere. So it's not really rejecting someone for shallow reasons but for religious/prejudiced reasons. Which would be red flags at best and instant dealbreakers at worst.

No, it's the same thing. If a woman says ""I don't date Jews"" then it might be for physical reasons or it might be for religious intolerance reasons. We can't know by that single statement.  Maybe she just doesn't like the look of Jewish men. You'd have to ask follow up questions to know her motivations - and in all likelihood, even she doesn't know her motivations. So, it's the same thing as ""I don't date short men"". Maybe it's for purely physical reasons, or maybe it's because of a prejudice. You can't know from that statement alone. 

So, you shouldn't mind getting married to a woman who says ""I don't date Jews"" if you meet her requirement of not bring Jewish. Until you ask follow up questions (whose responses will probably just be a form of after-the-fact rationalizations), that requirement is the same as a height requirement. 

Edit: for the record...I wouldn't enter into a long term relationship with a woman who verbalized ""I don't date short men, so luckily you meet my requirement"", nor would I with someone saying ""I don't date Jews, so luckily you meet my requirement"".  That person wouldn't share my values. "

Either a deal works, or it doesn't.  Seller's opinions/desires are not relevant... they will either sell you the property at a number that works for you, or you will not be doing business with them (don't take this as carte blanche to be rude... explain, if you can, that you have a specific set of numbers you need to meet in order to ensure you don't lose money, and that if the seller's circumstances change and they decide to reevaluate your offer that you are always looking to buy properties for numbers that work for you).

Dealing with investors is always harder than dealing with non-investors: they know the market, they know what their properties are worth, and they are going to value them at the HIGHER of their market value based on comps and their market value based on cashflow (especially for duplexes/4-plexes... comparable sales approach may not be relevant to a seller if their ""$50k"" place is netting $15k/yr).

Can you demonstrate that the first cause must be immaterial, timeless, omnipotent, omniscient, a single entity, etc.? Can you even demonstrate that the first cause must be a being? You're early premise is based on a lot of presupposition.

Until you can sufficiently support premise 4, I see no reason to address any of the ones after it, though I see some big issues with them too."
Sunfried,pics,1389022168.0,"I've seen the first series of Count Arthur Strong, and it's really funny.  Linehan just cowrote the TV series, but the series creator Steve Delaney (and who stars as Arthur Strong) has been doing that show on the radio for 7 series. Linehan has a lot of TV-writing experience, though, so he probably aided in the reboot (apparently it has a lot of original characters), and the show has some of the same sense of madcap comic surreality that Linehan's previous shows do.

You may also enjoy the new Matt Berry comedy ""Toast of London,"" which is even more surreal. His character, famed awful actor Steven Toast, is not far removed from his character as Douglas Reynholm."

Even taking the industrial revolution time frame into account it's very hard to deal with the noise in data.

The dip/increase in temperatures may very well be independent of the revolution.

Right now majority of the studies, for and against, are unfounded--or created by agencies that have an agenda. Rather than 3rd parties...

Edit: What being a chemical engineer means I have no background in statistical models or DOE?... *sigh*

All products and services deliberately overstate their ""value"" but they do so without outright deception.

If you are genuinely incapable at looking after yourself and being responsible enough to understand how money works you are mentally disabled (and there are people like that, who are legally incapable of signing a contract etc)

People who blame the companies for their own failings really piss me off. take some responsibility or alleviate yourself of all responsiblity.

if you are incapable of making informed responsible decisions thats ok, but you should equally be given no responsibility of power over anything such as children pets or voting."

i_lick_telephones,MakeupAddiction,1389022728.0,"I'm sorry, but your concerns seem to be self-centered and not thinking about how other people use this subreddit and how their experiences differ from yours.

I used to agree with you--what's the point taking the time to post a big thing if no one even seems to look at my posts or care? However:

1. FOTD's I think add nothing to the sub if products aren't listed. If the only reason you're posting is so we can see a pretty face with makeup on it, then we can go to a magazine for that. I'm all for just showing off your makeup, but I think you should have to provide the products you used. How can we replicate it if we have no idea what you used? Certain products also differ greatly depending on which brand you use, so it's always helpful to list which one worked best for you. Additionally, CC is impossible with a product list. I need to know beforehand if you used a primer or not to give you criticism on your eyeshadow being faint and creasing. If I know you used one, I know that there's another factor at play. I don't want to play a game of ask and answer when I just want to give someone feedback efficiently and effectively.

2. Again, are we here to look at pretty pictures? No, we are here to rave about products, share technique, ask for help, and so on. You should consider that even if no one comments, it's a possibility someone might like something you did, check the comments, and if you posted a product list, be able to look up what you used and buy it themselves. You would never know if this happened.

3. Sorry, but there's no way you monitor every thread on here and are able to accurately say it rarely happens. Just because it doesn't happen in your experience, doesn't mean it rarely happens. It happens to me quite a lot, and I'm sure it does for other people. It's very frustrating.

4. I use a shitton of products daily too. I find it easier to copy and paste a product list I posted from an earlier submission, and then change out what is needed. This takes maybe 2 minutes if that, and is much easier.

5. I think if you don't have time to make a proper full submission, then it's better to wait than to make a half-assed one. Making submissions aren't really supposed to be convenient. You should be prepared to follow the subreddits guidelines, and take the 5 minutes to ensure your post is complete. It's like doing an IAMA. It would be frustrating for someone to post their IAMA, but say they didn't have the time or the convenience to answer the questions now because they're at work and they'll answer later when they can. Post when you'll have the time to add a product list also. This way people won't have to keep monitoring your post to see if you'll post a product list. They'll have it right off the bat."

Marlise Munoz died the week after Thanksgiving.

Doctors believe she suffered a pulmonary embolism -- a blood clot to the lungs -- that cut off her oxygen. When her husband, Erick, found Marlise in their Tarrant County home, she wasn’t breathing and had no pulse.

She was gone.

If there is any mercy in the sudden loss of this happy young wife and mother, it’s that she doesn’t know she has since lingered in a hopeless twilight, her respiration artificially supported by machines.

She made it clear she didn’t want this. Her grieving husband and parents don’t want it either. But a not-very-well known statute under state law says Marlise, 33, doesn’t have the same right to a peaceful, natural death as other Texans because she is pregnant.

“All we want is to let her rest, to let her go to sleep,” said Marlise’s 60-year-old father, Ernest Machado of Azle. “What they’re doing serves no purpose.”

Marlise and Erick Munoz, the parents of a young son, both worked as paramedics for the town of Crowley. Because their jobs brought them into routine contact with sudden death and suffering families, they had conversations about their end-of-life wishes.

Marlise had made it clear she would never want to be kept artificially alive with no hope of recovery.

“Being active paramedics and knowing the facts, they know that people who have this happen to them don’t come out of this very well,” said Crowley Fire Department Lt. Tim Whetstone, a member of the town’s firefighters association that has rallied around the Munoz family.

Erick found Marlise at home Nov. 26. He performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation and called for an ambulance, and Marlise was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth.

Electric shocks and drugs started her heart again and it continued beating with mechanical support, but her brain waves were completely flat. She had gone without breathing for too long to ever recover.

But when the heartbroken family was ready to say goodbye, hospital officials said they could not legally disconnect Marlise from life support. At the time she collapsed, she was 14 weeks’ pregnant.

And because doctors could still detect a fetal heartbeat, state law says Marlise Munoz’s body -- against her own and her family’s wishes -- must be maintained as an unwilling incubator.

“That poor fetus had the same lack of oxygen, the same electric shocks, the same chemicals that got her heart going again,” Machado said. “For all we know, it’s in the same condition that Marlise is in.”

Because of the fetus’ poor prognosis, the family has said publicly that they want to allow it to die peacefully, along with its mother.

But after the bewildered family protested the fine print in the law during television interviews shortly before Christmas, the case exploded into an online argument between vehement anti-abortion and abortion-rights factions.

Some of the posted comments were vicious, accusing Erick Munoz -- a grief-stricken father and husband -- of wanting to “pull the plug” and “get rid” of his wife and baby.

Others -- strangers who don’t know these people -- claim Marlise “might wake up” or cling to slim odds that the oxygen-deprived fetus might be miraculously healthy.

“It turned into a right or left argument,” Whetstone said, explaining that Munoz has declined public comment on the case since reading some of the more vitriolic online comments. “That’s not really how the family sees this.”

Hospital authorities have declined all comment, other than to say they have no choice but to follow state law.

According to a 2012 report by the Center for Women Policy Studies, laws governing end-of-life preferences for pregnant women vary by state. Texas is one of 12 that automatically invalidates a woman’s legal prerogative if she “is diagnosed with pregnancy.”

“These are the most restrictive of the pregnancy exclusion statutes, stating that, regardless of the progression of the pregnancy, a woman must remain on life-sustaining treatment until she gives birth,” the report says.

Marlise’s mother has said publicly that the family is “in hell.” Erick, exhausted, has said he wants to shield the couple’s toddler son, Mateo, from the savage debate.

Machado said the family is hoping to find an attorney willing to challenge the statute.

“This very emotional and personal crisis for the family is their responsibility,” he wrote in an online posting a few weeks ago, trying to answer some of the more uninformed critics.

He’s right, of course. What the state of Texas is doing to this family is unconscionable.

“This isn’t about pro-life or pro-choice,” Machado said Friday. He apologized for crying as we spoke.

“We want to say goodbye. We want to let them rest.”

iIsMe95,gaming,1389022757.0,"Politics =/= strong narrative

Can it?  Of course, look at Game of Thrones.  Does that mean it always is?  No.  Politics is probably one of the hardest things to base a strong narrative around because of how complicated it is.  Since we have all these people arguing over politics, it felt to me that it was, ""The Story of the 2nd Battle of Hoover Damn, in which hundreds of brave men and women meet their fates and died heroically!  Also, there was a courier or something, I don't know.""  Personal stories often lose significance in big war stories, as wars most often come down to how well soldiers work together as opposed to how awesome the hero unit is.

In Fallout 3, however, the isolation and general lack of people make your journey all the more significant.  You get mentioned in person on the radio, people will say they've heard of you, and you not only save one city, you save an entire flood basin.  It feels like, ""The Storty of the Lone Wanderer, who brought the waters of life to the people of the wastes!  And the Brotherhood of Steel was there too.""  You are the focus, you are the savior, and not just a tacked on note in a bigger war.

14h0urs,selfharm,1389022770.0,"I'm 22 myself, but I work in a coffee shop. I used to work in a couple of bars but that was never a problem because most of the people I worked with had scars too and it was dark. 

In my coffee shop I have to wear a t-shirt, however I stopped hurting all of my arm when I was 16 so the scars are the colour of my skin, just slightly raised. I'd hurt myself under an armband (or my legs) so I've got a 3 inch thick band of scars around my left arm. I cover this up with a mesh of bracelets I wear permanently. 

My advice is wear a long sleeved shirt/blouse for the interview and then find out what your uniform or expected attire is for the job. You may not have anything to worry about. If you have to wear a t-shirt you could always wear a long sleeved one underneath. 

You'll find though, people don't pay as much attention to other people as you think, especially if they're busy working. Even those who are close to you. I recently hurt myself (it's vary rare these days) and I was in such a state I hurt my arm, which I haven't touched in years. I was in bed with the love of my life two nights ago and I was just in a tanktop. I kept seeing my scar in the corner of my eye when my arm was above the quilt and I kept panicking, but I realised that I hadn't looked at his forearm once the entire time we'd be in bed, so why would he be looking at mine? It's just because I know it's there. 

But think of it this way, once you've got the job, what are the scars getting in the way of? If someone notices, they most likely won't ask about them. If someone judges you for it and you lose out on work friendships, well so fucking what, would you want to be friends with a person so unaccepting anyway? "

If I were to try and describe the closest I think I've ever been to love...it was just a connection where it was instantaneous and obvious.

GeoffreyArnold,short,1389023503.0,"&gt;Buying into the idea that ""jewish"" is a race and that all jews have similar physical traits that seperate them physically from other races

In the United States, Jews are considered an ethnic group and a religion. Normally, when people talk about ""Jews"", they are talking about the ethnic group. It really has nothing to do with believing in a God or religious traditions. Most people characterize Jewish men as having relatively large noses and curly hair. These are physical features and I've actually heard women say that they ""don't like"" Jewish men, and mean it in a purely physical way. 

It's the same thing as saying ""I don't date short men"".

The hookup side of me is more than happy to use someone's forearm to illustrate and warn about the size of my cock in order to get laid.

woefulwank,AskReddit,1389023604.0,"Humans at an early age are the most fragile beings on the planet. Our emotions run deeper, our thoughts are more likely to interpret and elicit internal and external pain than any other mammal. How we experience the negative sensations of our birth (within the uterus;pre-birth) and post-birth; (infancy) decides our emotional capabilities later in life. 

I myself was within my mother's womb when my dad first started beating and verbally abusing my mother. A mother's emotional spectrum whilst you remain in her during pregnancy sends signals to the baby and there begins the development of bad neurological function/traits encoded throughout their DNA…most of which is brimming with overloaded cortisol levels (stress hormones). I then was born, and throughout my first year on Earth he continued to get more violent, more abusive, more fucked up and I soaked up all of this. 
And so do a large number of unlucky souls. 

That's why having fucked up parents determines the future potential of that child. How they grow to deal with stress, how their brains comprehend social situations, the list goes on and on. It is a deeply troubling experience as a child learning to grow with what is going on in your mind; when you are having to depend on these ill-fated,hollow- hearted and erroneous beings as your carers. And given the fact that most intrusive and damaging thoughts often integrate into a child's consciousness at an early stage, they are essentially paving way for a challenging life ahead. And that's just in terms of how that person has learned and picked up social cues from their broken family units. It has been proven that negative experience/habitual patterns formed within our parents' neurology are embedded within our genetic code and passed down. *Here is some research into Epigenetics and mice, and how their parents pass down bad memories and how there can be triggered within the next generation of mice: http://discovermagazine.com/2013/may/13-grandmas-experiences-leave-epigenetic-mark-on-your-genes. 

We are literal manifestations of our parents will, intent or lack of it to bring about a positive life experience for their children. You might think fuck…that's a lot of responsibility. Yes, yes it is. And many people who shoot inside a person  do not consider the potential hell that can brought about in a another human's life, and so they should of thought very, very carefully."

Sir_Fancy_Pants,AskReddit,1389023607.0,"its a question of balance, while what you write is true what i write is also true.

The key difference is how essential that ""life skill"" is, its unreasonable for someone to have specialist medical knowledge to know if a certain vitamin supplement is a ""scam"" or not. so rightly so we have regulations to protect the average consumer.

Likewise the terms of law etc don't honour billion year contracts or terms and conditions that are deemed ""unfair"" but transparent. (such as waiving the right to sue for negligence during a bungee jump, something i signed once knowing it was invalid)

But the point is being able to understand basic maths and how money at its most simple level works is hardly ""specialist knowledge"" to be a non mentally impaired adult you are expected and should know this as a basic requirement to be a functioning human.

People who complain about the companies should be stripped of their power to be legally responsible for themselves.

As in the case of the drug dealer, absolutely i blame consumers over dealers every single time. (morally and logistically) as a point of principle responsible and intelligent adults should be free to make an informed decision and have access to any drug they wish."

If you think you qualify on all three counts or don't give a damn about them, go right ahead. You get out what you put in though.

Proper research on their use is a definite must. Anabolic and androgenic steroids are extremely potent drugs and you need to treat them with the concomitant respect, and whenever possible err on the side of conservatism with dosing.

The ethics of PED use depends on the competition's rules and prevailing standards. Do they ban them? Is testing so lax that everyone uses them anyway? Are you simply using this as an excuse to justify your own cheating? Or do they not give a fuck?

SCphotog,photography,1389023690.0,"I agree that it's very powerful. In the right hands a fantastic tool, but I believe that a great number of lightroom users (maybe most), do not ""learn lightroom"" but instead only or mostly use the presets, filters.

I see a lot of images... from forums, user groups, photography seminars etc... and, as you stated I see lots of trends fomented by the use of Lightroom. It is the go to software for mom-tographers, and weekend wedding shooters.

It is certainly, much more than Instagram but I think that's how it is used by a hell of a lot of people that think that's all that you do with a photograph. ie... pick a ""look"" and you're done. 

I'm not disagreeing with the power or potential of the software, but more how it gets used by a seeming majority. I'll add that I think you can do as much or more with other softwares, for less or no money. 

For me personally, I find it aggravating that the software inhibits its use an 'just' an editor, trying to force me into ""allowing"" it to catalog my images. 

It can be done, but its geared to make it difficult. I feel like Adobe uses the catalog feature to lock the user into their paradigm. Even if you don't like it... it's difficult to stop using it once you're in.

I purchased lightroom in the hopes of using its lens distortion correction feature... but mostly gave up because of the catalog issue. It's inordinately difficult to simply open a single image, edit, save and then exit."

Wiltron,AskReddit,1389023696.0,"With any work out, it's all about intake vs. output.

If you intake 3000 kcal every day, you need to be burning at least 1500 of that in raw output. You had better be running a marathon every day, as the average desk jockey burns only 500 kcal sitting on their ass all day, give or take.

Drop your intake to 1200 kcal a day, easily done if you're willing to do it. I eat a single serving of maple brown sugar oatmeal for breakfast with an XL coffee, two cream, no sugar. The coffee speeds up my digestive system so for the most part, I poop out the oatmeal along with last nights' dinner, before lunch.

I then have a single serving mixed yogurt around 10 with a Fiber1 granola bar. For lunch it's some fruit, usually pineapple and some carrots, no dips or anything. 2PM it's a bit of carbs with some mixed greens and pasta, and then a chicken breast around 5pm.

I mix green and white teas throughout the day, as the warm liquids tend to be good for the digestive system, as well as fill my hydration intake. Get a good loose leaf tea and learn to love it. It's hard, but worth it.

Lastly, a walk with my dog for 20min or more after work.

I have a standing desk at work, and try to remain standing all day, which helps posture, as well as strengthen muscles. I have boasa ball I sit on when required, which helps strengthen abs and ass.

**Exercising**

Don't waste money on a gym membership unless you're going to power lifting, or are training for high-output sports. 90% of all exercise you can do at home. At my home gym, I have this half boasa ball, half saucer type thing my friend gave me. I stand on it and try to keep my balance using only my abs and legs. I then use resistive bands (big elastic bands with handles on each end) to stretch out and endurance stretch my uppers (arms, shoulders, etc), while trying to keep balanced on a ball. Very hard to do, sounds easy when written.

Other Notes:

You WILL be hungry for the first few days to a week. Power through it. **There is no such thing as a cheat day.** You can have a Big Mac and large fries, but remember that if you intake that much, you're severely limiting yourself to what you can eat the rest of the day. Eating a ton of veggies and then binging on a big mac isn't healthy either.

You will have runny poop for the first few days as your body adjusts. This is normal. Greenish tint is also normal if you're coming from a heavy fatty diet of frequent fast food. That is excess bile that your body is used to producing to help break down fats. It will go away with time. Yellow poop can be a sign of digestive distress and bacteria imbalance. Keep an eye on it, especially if it smells like sulfur. That is usually your intestinal bacteria adjusting and changing to the different foods.

Multivitamins are useless for most of the population of a 1st world nation. Don't waste your money on them. If you're worried, take magnesium, vitamin C and D. One a day of each, 500mg and 500ui, respectively, are enough for anyone who isn't living in poverty. Magnesium will aid you in feeling full, but may not work well with other daily medications, so be cautious and consult your doctor before taking."
Malcolm_Sex,INTP,1389023697.0,"I really really don't know how to react to compliments.  I feel like a child when someone compliments me.  I don't need your validation!

I also dislike physical contact.  Instead of physically recoiling, I often just freeze, and often in a very uncomfortable position.  Internally, it's excruciating.

Necron_Overlord,Feminism,1389023872.0,"&gt;I'm not sure why you think I am trying to make fun of you?

Ah, I was speaking generally.  As a straight, white, upper-middle class man, the ""punching up/punching down"" argument can often sound like ""everyone can make fun of you, you can't make fun of anyone.""

Some self-identified feminists (who often have Tumblr accounts) use the ""punching"" argument as an excuse to be very rude and belittling to others, treating them without courtesy or dignity, which is why a lot of people see feminist as a whole as self-righetous hypocrites.

For example, Chanty Binx is a feminist blogger (prominent on Tumblr, helps define ""Tumblr feminist"") who leads demonstrations in Toronto (maybe she doesn't lead them, I don't know - she shows up with a megaphone and people [assume she's a leader](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BavarianFireDrill)), and does distasteful things like screaming ""Shut the fuck up!"" at people (men and women) through megaphones for trying to a have a conversation with her while she's haranguing them.  She's the best propaganda machine an anti-feminist could ask for.

On her blog, she routinely justifies treating people -- who are trying to have a polite conversation with her -- in such a contemptuous manner by citing the ""punching up/punching down"" argument.  The reality is that she's just a narcissist with poor personal skills and no media saavy at all, but because she makes herself prominent and hides behind arguments like this, there are a lot of people who automatically associate that form of defense with being a self-righteous hypocrite.

fitnerd21,AskMen,1389023877.0,"Seeing as how the other aspects of the relationship are going well (He likes talking to you, opens up to you, and is mildly jealous of your affection), I'd talk more about the sex thing.  It may not be that he only wants sex, but it's a big component in a relationship for him.  Being with you exclusively would mean doing without for some indeterminate time.

Other than that, continue to openly communicate your feelings: 

""I want a long term relationship with someone of like mind, that will work with me to give the relationship the best chance of succeeding.  If that's you, great.  If not, I think it's best if we both move on. And by that, I mean you have stop getting jealous any time I talk about a guy."""

I don't know about your school but mine requires an advising appointment to make sure we know where we stand and what classes we still need to take to finish our degree; the advisor will also tell us what classes remain in the ""pre-law track"", but it is up to us to decide if we want to take those classes or not. Obviously if you're wanting to go to Law School you should take them, as they are designed to educate you such that you can score well on the LSAT, but it's entirely up to you.

soafraidofbees,OkCupid,1389024100.0,"I can totally get why you'd be frustrated after this repeated experience, but I don't think you're ""fucking up"" and I don't think these women are ""leading you on."" A back-and-forth of 8 messages feels significant when so many messages never get a reply, but imagine if you'd had the same conversation with each of these women at a party. It would've taken like 5 minutes to do the whole back-and-forth contained in all your messages, right? And then if she'd kind of wandered off to talk to her friends after chatting with you for a few minutes, you wouldn't think ""I FUCKED EVERYTHING UP!"" or ""THAT GIRL WAS LEADING ME ON!"" It's just what happens when there's a huge group of people all interacting at once. The only difference is that on OKC you can't see all the other people at the ""party"" that these women are chatting with. Not to mention, sometimes they'll start a conversation on OKC but then have something in their real life come up that takes their focus away from online dating. 

I think you're doing the right thing by asking women to meet after a couple of messages. Some people on OKC are not interested in actually following through with dates, they just use it to kill time and troll for attention. If you're chatting with one of these people, it's best to find out early. But there's nothing you can do with an OKC message to get them to completely change their pattern and agree to meet you. Just keep trying until you hit it off with somebody who responds to a couple of good messages with ""Hey, we should continue this conversation over drinks."" We are out there, I promise."
EGrshm,acappella,1389024100.0,"Sure, that's fine with me. I found that the fundraising/selling has been the hardest part of the process, but that's probably because I was doing most of the work/organization. Trying to get artists to raise money feels like herding cats.

In regards to info... I'm part of a group at Loyola University of Chicago called Loyolacappella. The past few years, we had drifted away from producing CDs and I tried to get us back to that. It took us a long time, but we finally finished our [5th CD, Lo#YOLOcappella.](http://imgur.com/G5d0HwF)

In regards to bedroom recording... It was practically a studio. We pick a room with nice acoustics, duct taped blankets to the walls, and hired a recording engineer from the Chicago area that specifically does A Cappella (Ben Libermann, he was good, but a bit of an asshole. It's not really his job to be nice though). We recorded the parts individually and I'd say we're happy with the results! It was definitely cheaper than traveling to a studio (the closest A Cappella recording studio is about a 45 minute drive north). We finished recording in roughly 52 hours. Carl Taylor out of Raleigh, NC mixed, edited, and mastered the album.

EDIT: [Here's a video about our production](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVJFzcEw8cY). We never did anything BOCA worth, but then again we never submitted anything to BOCA haha. Any feedback on the album would be appreciated. "

frsp,Anarcho_Capitalism,1389024110.0,"Let's be honest here: If you support Keynesianism you really have not read much about economic science. You may think you have, based on reading the latest paranoid fantasies from sensationalists like Piers Morgan or fictional works about social-democratic utopias from nutters like Michael Moore. But you certainly haven't read Mises and Rothbard...or even the works of Luis de Molina for that matter.
How do I know this? Because I did read them. I surely do not agree with all they have to say, but I simply could not imagine myself claiming to have an opinion on something so critical without at least reading the basics. Yet despite the raw passion I see in Keynesians, social-democrats, Marxists and so on...I have yet to find one that can answer even basic questions just to prove they've read the major works of top economists.
It seems obvious your opinions are being controlled. Keynesian people are exploiting the combination of your ignorance of economics and your rights to vote and to speak publicly. They rely on your passion for righteousness and use emotion-words like ""aggregate demand"" and ""economic stimulus"" to bypass your brain's rational defenses against their lies. This is propaganda 101, for it is always easier and more profitable to make someone believe what they want to believe than to help them accept unpleasant or unfamiliar truth.
Keynesianism is a bad idea. To praise it blindly without reading what is said either by its critics (or even its founders and proponents) is a worse idea. But the worst idea of all is to take what is already bad and make it exponentially worse by central planning. This is what you are doing. You hate child labor. You want to build roads. People are suffering and even dying all over the world, and all because you can't admit you are unqualified to promote any form of economics...and that you are merely latching onto what is popular or makes you ""feel good"".
I invite you one and all to refute me. Prove to me you are qualified to offer an objective and learned opinion on economics, THEN try to defend the Keynesian system. For I have searched low &amp; high and cannot find anyone who could do so...or who would want to after reading even the most basic works of economic science.
With one hand I now drop the mic...and with the other I have thrown down the gauntlet.

How'd I do?"

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1389024384.0,"I've been in abusive relationships previously, so whenever this topic comes up I'm usually the first to say that metta begins with yourself. A person should have compassion for themselves by escaping the situation (as you rightly said). I do believe this shows compassion for the abuser as well because then you are doing everything in your power to remove at least one seed of that person's negative karma by causing them to harm one less person, which would be you in this case. Also, facing consequences like prison time can be the cause of their repentance and reformation (**you still have to remove yourself from the equation though**). 

I honestly do not think it is healthy to tell people that they must ""forgive"" their previous abuser because it has the connotation of the abused person letting that abuser into their emotional boundaries again. **This is never a good idea**. If the abuser was truly reformed they would understand that there is too much of a power imbalance to salvage a healthy relationship with the abused person. 

So in the case of the past abuser, I think it's healthier to think in terms of self-preservation rather than accommodating the needs of the abuser through reconciliation. **The fact that the victim can be more concerned about the abuser's well-being than his or her own is a reflection of the power the abuser had over the victim in the first place**. Self-preservation would include not letting what they did to you dictate who you are or your worth as a person. 

Saying that, I understand that escaping is *hard* and the pull to return to the abusive situation is strong. This is often forgotten when people call the victim ""stupid"" or ""weak"" for returning to the abusive situation. If I were you I wouldn't get caught up in labels like ""weak"" or ""strong"" that place moral values on your decision to stay or go. They can be self-defeating--you may be tricked into thinking that you aren't worth saving if you believe that you are ""weak"". Instead, like I said above, it's a matter of self-preservation, not how ""good"" or ""bad"" you are."

I didn't realize it was a joke, and the next few encounters I had with self-identified MRAs did more to corroborate that definition than contradict it, to the extent that I believed these people were simply unironically referring to themselves as rape apologists because they felt that strongly about the perceived epidemic of false rape accusations.

wraith313,relationships,1389024677.0,"A couple of things: If you like her so much but don't think itll work, cut off all ties.

If she is touching your hand etc then she is probably into you.

You are in a relationship. If you like this chick more than your girlfriend you need to break up with your girlfriend BEFORE you make a move or anything. Because it isn't right to be in a relationship with somebody and harboring feelings for someone else.

Finally: She isn't perfect. She is just another person. You need to realize that and take her off the pedestal. She isn't ""the one for you"" or ""the only girl in the world"". She is just ""a girl"" and there will be others. Weigh it. You have a gf, you have these friends, etc. It's not good to be in a relationship you arent fully invested in and its not good to be putting the eyes on your friends girlfriend (and you have done this, apparently, 2 or more times so far).

Boundaries. You shouldnt be hanging out with her solo and touching her hands and stuff anyway. I assume you guys were alone, because idk why your friend would let you have your hands on his gf.

You're emotionally cheating on your gf right now, so you need to just end that if you can't stop. You are, arguably, going on dates with this girl behind your friends back and your girlfriends back. And you are texting back and forth. These are all HUGE boundaries you are crossing. You need to get your priorities in order. At the very least, either quit talking to and hanging out with this girl or break up with your girlfriend. 

Edit: In light of the fact that OP is single now, take all my gf advice and replace it with ""you are going on dates with your friends girlfriend behind his back""."

I read the book some time ago, so other input would be nice, but I remember thinking it to be more a way of saying that your actions live on and affect others far away in time and space, but not necessarily a reincarnation.) is intermingled with the idea that time is non-linear.

WraithPDX,worldnews,1389024732.0,"Couple things here:

* Minke Whales are allowable for whaling [under the Special Permit granted by the IWC.](http://iwc.int/permits) Up to 850 in fact. They are also designated as ""Least Concern"" with [Natureserve rating them as ""Stable.""](http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchSciOrCommonName=minke+whale&amp;x=0&amp;y=0)

* Like it or not, the Japanese whaling fleets are working within the quotas set upon them by the IWC. [The last objectionable kill they had was in 1987/88.](http://iwc.int/table_objection)

* Even the New Zealand government, who condemned the whaling, is saying that it isn't occurring in their territorial waters.

Sea Shephard has a very obvious agenda and they are going to sensationalize every single kill that the Japanese do. Note that they focus less on the objectionable kills that Norway seems to do every single year. Every press release they do should be read with a very large grain of salt.

Because there has been a load of questions directed towards me on this I'm going to put some more information out here.

Yes, the IWC has petitioned Japan to stop their lethal sampling methods, as noted in the 2005 and 2007 IWC resolutions.

&gt;*2005 Resolution Conclusion* - STRONGLY URGES the Government of Japan to withdraw its JARPA II proposal or to revise it so that any information needed to meet the stated objectives of the proposal is obtained using non-lethal means.

&gt; *2007 Resolution Conclusion* - CALLS UPON the Government of Japan to address the 31 recommendations listed in Appendix 4 of Annex O of the Scientific Committee report relating to the December 2006 review of the JARPA I programme to the satisfaction of the Scientific Committee; FURTHER CALLS UPON the Government of Japan to suspend indefinitely the lethal aspects of JARPA II conducted within the **Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.**

The Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary brings up a problem: The legality has been called into question, since the creation of a sanctuary has to meet certain criteria as outlined in the [original 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling](http://iwc.int/cache/downloads/1r2jdhu5xtuswws0ocw04wgcw/convention.pdf). It's been argued that the IWC violated it's own charter when adopting it by failing to meet certain criteria:

&gt; These amendments of the Schedule (a) shall be such as are necessary to carry out the objectives and purposes of this Convention and to provide for the conservation, development, and optimum utilization of the whale resources; (b) **shall be based on scientific findings**; (c) shall not involve restrictions on the number or nationality of factory ships or land stations, nor allocate specific quotas to any factory ship or land station or to any group of factory ships or land stations; and (d) **shall take into consideration the interests of the consumers of whale products and the whaling industry.**

Yes, Japan hunts more than just minke whales. In the first link, the quotas are clearly defined:

&gt; The 2004/05 Antarctic season was the final year of the 16-year 'JARPA' programme, following a 2-year feasibility study. After completion of the JARPA programme, Japan initiated a JARPA II programme, initially as a 2-year feasibility study, for 850±10% and 10 fin whales in the Antarctic. In 2009/10, the full JARPA II programme commenced and the current permit has been for **850±10% Antarctic minke whales, 50 fin whales and 50 humpback whales annually.** To date, Japan has refrained from taking humpback whales.

No, I do not work for the Japanese government or the Institute of Cetacean Research. I do not support Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, but I understand their frustrations.

EDIT: Also, for anti-whaling people, I suggest following the case of [Australia v. Japan in the International Court of Justice.](http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=1&amp;case=148) Public hearings were concluded in July, though I haven't heard any word yet on deliberations, nor do I know when a ruling will come out.

Please stop watching TV. There is no such thing as climate scientists...

My engineering background excels at design and implementation of experiments as well as data collection. I judge and comment how studies are performed in regards to their data collection. If I can find fallacies in their collection of data it makes their conclusions unfounded.

I'm not engineering parts for vehicles, I'm engineering methods to determine how X, Y, and Z will turn out when we input 1, 2, and 3 with mathematical models. Which are in direct use today.

Sir_Fancy_Pants,AskReddit,1389024897.0,"absolutely not,

The very nature of responsibility is directly related to the level of influence and control you have over the situation.

Unless a drug dealer actively spikes or injects the person unknowingly the burden of all responsibilities of what goes into your body is yours.

Claiming the people who are ""weak"" or ""incapable of making choices etc"" is a two way street, its rather hypocritical that you forgive the consumer because ""How are they to know"" but blame the dealer ""as if they know"" what's to stop the dealer claiming they ""dont know any better either"".

The entire premise of your view is that you actually deny people their own individual liberty and responsiblity, now that is actually fine and valid, but you cant tailor it randomly, you either accept as a model that people are responsible and capable to make informed decisions and thereby remove the limitations, or you don't and you protect them by introducing limitations and restrictions.

Responsibility for your actions and choices are always yours, because you have greatest control and power over what you do.

Also, if you're using a clay bowl as opposed to ceramic, I believe it's a little harder to get heat evenly distributed through the bowl, as it's less conductive than ceramic and may not bake the shisha properly unless you have enough coals on.

T3chnopsycho,explainlikeimfive,1389025232.0,"It had to do with what it would cost and what would be gained in return. 

There would have been a lot of difficulties. If Hitler had started to conquer Switzerland the Swiss army had the plan of going into the Réduit. This was basically giving up a large part of the country and going to hiding in the mountains. Sounds maybe stupid (giving up all your cities) but the strategically most important part of Switzerland are all the passes over and the tunnels going through the mountains (e.g. [the Gotthard tunnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthard_Tunnel)) These are very important passages to travel north - south in Europe. By hiding in bunkers throughout the Alps we could have still guarded these passages.

And to add to that there were plans to destroy these tunnels which would have basically made any conquering more or less meaningless.

Also it is rather difficult to fight an enemy in the mountains especially when that is their home territory. 

The next point is that the axis powers wouldn't have gained that much from conquering Switzerland as they didn't really depend on having those geographical points. 

Also noting the Swiss military was at that time quite large (proportional to the number of citizens) which has to do with our military system (every man has to do military service and is in sort of reserve after that service so if we would mobilize we could effectively more than double our numbers in rather a short time.)

And the last point (which some Swiss people dislike to admit) is that we also held diplomatic relations with all sides of the war. We did hold a lot of the money of all contenders and we also didn't (at least openly) support either side of the war. So no party had a reason to attack us. Last thing was that we also really held ourselves out of the war and just secured our country. Even though some of our cities were bombed we didn't threaten anyone nor did we declare war. 

Add to that that we have always been rather a bit ~~isolationist~~ non-interventionist (like not joining any big country groups or alliances and thus didn't have any reason nor obligation to join the war.

I have to say I cannot guarantee that this is all 100% correct. I'm Swiss and this is also a topic that interests me a lot. And I've also discussed this a lot of times before. 

 I also have some other reasons but for those I'm really not sure if they are just speculation or have valid proof so I'll leave them out.

The dress code is a funny topic. On one hand, many of us will complain about the lack of formality, but on the other hand, we are quick to remind each other that we should be more concerned with a man's internal qualities. Not long ago there was a national discussion on this when pictures of some new MMs were circulating the internet, showing all of them in jeans and t-shirts.

&gt;Secondly, mathematics is not discovered by humans through empirical means. Nor would it be impossible for young kids to master their first language in such a short space of time if all we did was empirical learning, like animals. It takes adults decades to learn what young kids can can in a few years. Both language and mathematics show strong evidence of relying on some manner of knowledge that is not sourced from sense experience, and knowledge discovery that relies on innate knowledge and concepts

The majority of people acquire these skills through observation and learning. Language wouldn't even exist if there was only one human that existed, and without a meaningful way to refer to things I don't think that mathematics would exist either.

&gt;If this was actually true for human knowledge then no knowledge would exist because nothing in nature can justify any inductive inference or probabilistic prediction humans make. How we come up with scientific theories has nothing to do with what we observe

This is simply not true. Most of our scientific theories are framed around things that we observe (i.e. evolution) , or are you conflating the common definition of theory with that of the scientific field?

&gt;You are presupposing empiricism and also assuming scientific discovery relies on direct empirical observations. We do not or at least this is something you need to argue for.

* The public key is mathematically determined from the private key

* Moving Bitcoin's from your account is done via sending a message to the network

* This message + the private key makes an encrypted message

* The encrypted message + the public key unencrypts the message

* If you give the message, the encrypted message, and the public key to the network, you prove you own the private key and, thus, you can move any funds associated with the public key.  The network never sees your private key.

lightswitch05,forhire,1389025503.0," - Are the results of this app shared across the multiple devices?

If so, your going to need a server, some sort of authentication, and a domain. All this comes with monthly maintenance fees. Not only that, but now you need synchronization logic, user &amp; group logic, and perhaps permission logic to prevent people from just saying they won a bunch of games. All this is going to take a decent amount of designing and testing - which could end up taking a lot time depending on the experience level of whoever you hire.

If sharing results cross-device is a requirement, then you could save a little bit of time &amp; money by just making it a mobile-friendly website and not worry about all the extra app code. But you'll still have the monthly hosting fees, no way to get around that if you want results to be shared.

- If results are not shared cross-device

you can keep it as an app, and you won't have any monthly hosting fees. But not having stats shared across multiple devices/people could make your idea worthless depending on your needs.

- More advice

Make a detailed list of the features you want, then separate then into 3 groups: ""Required"", ""Wanted"", and ""Nice to have"". Most ideas start out simple, but they often grow out of control. Setting a rigid scope will help make it manageable for your budget and your developer.

It might also help you figure out the features your wanting (getting the app out of your head) by drawing potential screens on paper, don't worry about making them look good. Having a general layout of the most important screens is a huge step in requirement gathering. **If your goal is to hire a less experienced developer, then you need very clear and detailed requirements.** An experienced developer would be able to spot poorly defined requirements and work with you to figure out what exactly it is that you want rather than giving you an end product that doesn't meet your needs, but of course that doesn't come cheap either.

Good luck!"

Also, you said she has a history of cheating, a history of feeling restricted in monogamous relationships, and that she agrees it would be unrealistic to remain faithful for over a year of LDR. If you're out sexing other girls, I'm sure it would be even harder for her to stay monogamous...really, what motivation would she have to remain faithful? She's already admitted it would be hard for her to remain faithful, you seeing other girls would just make it even harder. 

Also, what would you even tell these hypothetical other girls? Would you be honest and tell them you're just using them to get some notches on your belt so you can eventually commit to your gf? 

If she wants an open relationship, I say just go for that and deal with the jealousy. If you're really stuck on the idea of a monogamous relationship, then try that out, and don't be so hung up on the fact that your ""number"" is lower than hers. But I don't think a one-way open relationship would work at all, or be fair to anyone involved. "

Every few months I'd go to the dermatologist and get my ear vacuumed out, I bust a nut everytime it felt that good. It's gone now, but now eczema appeared around my nose. Steroids don't work for me anymore :(

* The writers did a great job writing the Beckett character.  She is tough but feminine with a tragic past that is not over the top or cheesy and Stana Katic perfectly executes the character.
* The mysteries are fun and always have a good plot twist
* The bromance between Castle, Esposito, and Ryan is funny and totally believable

One thing that's getting old though is the ""will they or won't they"" between Beckett and Castle.  It doesn't feel believable.  I don't see any reason why a character like Castle would be so hopelessly puppy dog in love with a character like Beckett.  However I'm catching up through DVD's on Netflix, so I don't know if that relationship evolves in any way in the newer seasons.

One of the things that first put me off of the show was the insanely hot super model cop, but she plays it perfectly and makes it believable.  I didn't watch it until my friends kept telling me it was an excellent show, so I finally gave it a shot and it's really good."

The fight comes to how you gather those taxes, libertarians view income tax as theft, forcefully taking part of your income. Where as sales tax is perfectly acceptable, it is a voluntary act of buying goods(although it is a necessity). There are several things libertarians are divided over, a social safety net is one and abortion are the two big ones. Some label a social safety net as a redistribution of wealth, which to an extent is correct if you run off an income tax system. Though while I think we should have a social safety net others may not agree. However a social safety net is designed as a temporary measure which is needed in any economy since economies are not always stable and go through ups and downs. If you want to run any sort of economy designed on capital you must provide a social safety net, we live in a society and it is immoral to say fuck anyone who doesn't have a job because it could be the economies fault and thus societies fault. Libertarian should also be against mega corps and corporate involvement in government, corporate interest does not translate to individualism, protecting the populous as a whole protects more individual rights than protecting corporate interests, something many libertarians don't seem to grasp.

alienkcc451,AskReddit,1389026240.0,"I virtually never remember my dreams - in my whole life I have ever remembered 4.  So few I still recall all of them. Two of them are strange enough to answer your question. 

1- I was in a serious 2 1/2 year relationship with one woman, and had a *very* vivid sexual encounter with a different chick that was a huge crush of mine in HS/college. The dream was so vivid that I woke up the next morning and felt guilty for cheating on my GF, even though it was only in a dream. I had to talk myself down from confessing to her… 

2- This is a bit stranger, I was walking through my hometown and realized I didn't have my keys, which I distinctly remembered locking in my apartment, so I couldn't get home.  I called my parents, who live about 20 min away, so they could bring me my spare car keys.  My mother was on the phone and she told me they didn't have my spare keys but they were in my apartment.  But she'd come get me and take me home. The next thing I know my mother is there and we are talking face to face.  She asked where my keys were and I told her I locked them in my apartment, then I realized the absurdity of that statement.  I realized in my dream that I was dreaming because my car keys and apartment keys are always on the same ring and I could not have locked the door to my apartment with the keys inside.  My brain logically deduced it was a dream and then I just thought to myself about waking up and I did and laughed IRL.

tl;dr 1 - sex dream so vivid that I felt I needed to tell my GF I cheated
tl'dr 2 - brain logically deduced it was dreaming due to factual errors. "

While it has tools for creating glyphs in-application, the good thing is that you can actually create all your glyphs in AI and import them... [bookmark this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOTLwmmrv8s) if you decide to give it a shot. Since you're already comfortable with AI's vector-manipulation tools, Fontlab's tools will probably seem somewhat unwieldy, so that video and the accompanying template should help a lot. Starting off, you'll pretty much only be using Fontlab to copy/paste your glyphs and to adjust your kerning.

If you're up for it, there are also tutorials on how to code your own ligatures. I'd suggest starting with a mono-spaced typeface if you're just getting familiarized with the application, though."

Dantilli,socialskills,1389026462.0,"The best advice I have is to slow down. Speak slower and think about the words coming out of your mouth. If you speak fast then watching what you say is really hard but if you slow down it becomes almost effortless. 

Before you think that you'll sound strange if you speak slower, trust me, you won't. If you listen to other people speak I bet you'll find plenty of people that speak much slower than you do.

The easiest way of getting rid of a habit is to replace it with another habit. Sometimes this is a good idea sometimes it isn't. Maybe in your case you can substitute ""like"" with a pause. Again it won't sound odd, many people pause when speaking to give the listener time to comprehend what they're saying and to compose their own thoughts.

As for the jokes, slowing down is the most important thing. Make sure to breathe properly, maybe take a few nice deep breaths when you feel the nervousness coming on, and speak much slower than normal. If you take things slow and calm the urge to fil every silence with a joke should be much less powerful. If you do feel that almost hysterical urge, just take a deep breath. If after the deep breath you still want to say it, then do, just remember to breathe first. Don't get so worried that you don't say any jokes though, if you stay nice and calm you shouldn't need to monitor it too much. Calming the nervousness is more important than whether you're going to say a joke or not."

rhymes_with_chicken,granturismo,1389026510.0,"absolutely *HATE* this advice. If you like driving, the experience of the game is completely different with a handheld controller. Yes, I have plenty of friends who can still whip me with a controller vs. me with my wheel. But, I actually feel like I'm driving.

ok, put another way--I specifically bought my PS3 for GT5 when it was released. i don't really play any other games. the price for everything for a great driving sim was worth it. the system, the game, and the logitech driving force GT wheel came home in the same bag. this was the setup they had running at fry's and it was love at first drive.

i think i put blisters on my hands for 48 hours straight. it was nirvana in racing game form. then, for giggles i thought i'd try the controller. I hated it. I even gave it an hour's worth of play to see if any good could come from it. about the only benefit is being able to go lock-to-lock in an instant. but, then that's not a realistic simulation then, is it?

nope, if you want to play the game I'd say get a wheel out of the gate. i have nothing but good things to say about my driving force GT wheel. it is on the lower end of the force feedback wheels (force feedback is absolutely mandatory--otherwise don't bother with the game at all)---picked it up for an even $100 from fry's. but, it is durable and solid feeling. nothing cheap or plasticy about it--and i've put 1000s and 1000s of miles on the thing since december of '10.

i'll also mention that GT6 feels like an update of GT5 rather than a full version bump. it feels like they just fully rendered out some of the GT4 cars from GT5 up to GT5 levels, and added some tracks. Not complaining--especially since i got GT6 on sale for $40 i'd have spent more than that for the DLC in GT5. I'm just saying if you like GT6, you may want to pick up GT5 as well when the price drops for a slightly varied racing experience."

For instance, once I'm at work in the morning, I'll give myself 20 minutes of screw around time, then commit to working straight-on until 11:45. My to-do lists are made up of options so I'll work on my most high-priority task, but have other things I can select from if I get stuck on that high priority item. If I complete ""enough"" (by a somewhat arbitrary gauge that lines up with my deadlines), I get to dick around on the internet or whatever for a bit. I rinse and repeat for the afternoon. The point is to commit to working for those three plus hours, even if I have to switch tasks up in order to maintain focus. When I get home in the evening, I give myself 15 minutes to unwind and smoke my brains out, then give the sprogs undivided attention, get dishes done, get cooking done, etc. My meds make me pretty sleepy, so I'm usually mentally exhausted by 9, which is a good time to walk the dog and daydream and stuff."

You still want to meet eventually but he will already have seen pictures of you and the both of you will have gotten to know each other and you could even talk on the phone on skype.  technology is awesome for those that don't do great with face to face meet and great situations"

Heck, you should really understand all of these things if you want to be an effective human. ;)

Dweebl,Drugs,1389026558.0,"I was swimming in the public pool across the street from my house with a bag of weed (.5g), 2 bottles of Captain Morgan, and two friends. It was 2:00am and this pool doesn't have any houses around for at least 400 metres because it's in a big field.

We were having a really good time until two (!) squad cars showed up. I guess my neighbour called the cops. So we climb back over the fence all wet and in shorts, and kinda cold. This is a tiny town and the police don't have shit to do so they kept talking to us, and we sort of started mouthing off a bit. I figured they weren't going to process us for swimming in a pool because people do it all the time at this pool. 

After he yelled at us a bunch, the one officer who was acting the most macho and aggressive jumped over the fence to see if we left anything else in there and found my tiny bag of barely any weed. So he hops back over the fence, shoves me to the ground, picks me up and puts me in an arm lock because I am ""under arrest for possession of a controlled substance."" (as if weed makes me a physical threat!) In Canada for that amount I can't be printed or anything, but I can get put in the criminal justice system. 

So anyway he puts us in the car and starts taking our names, as he's increasingly angry with our attitude. Then when he sees my last name, it turns out he knows me and that he's a member of the boat club my family is part of XD

I had to pay a $65 dollar fine, so I guess I wasn't technically under arrest even though he said I was.

The next day at the boat club he won a prize for his pioneer costume, which was hilarious.

The best part of the story is that when I saw him this year (one year after the incident) he was strangely cold and almost shy to talk to me. Then my mom told me that he lost his job because he was caught 4 times over the alcohol limit crossing from the states back into Canada.

I grow my yeast up from plates, slants and slurries so it's important not to contaminate a sample or the contaminant will propagate right through the whole process.

Stir plate can make a big difference if you're growing up starters over 2L and want high cell count, viability and vitality. Recently did an experiment with a 10gal batch split into to separate fermenters, one was pitched with a Wyeast smack pack and the other was pitched with a 2L starter grown up from another smack pack of the same strain. Gravity and CO2 output were measured daily. There was no appreciable difference in fermentation activity, finishing gravity, or user impressions so I'd say at that scale (5gal fermentation, SG 1.060) you don't even need a starter, let alone a stir plate."

If we believe business owners will make choices that bring profit to their business, then we must consider that Bitcoin will succeed because the rational thing for an online merchant to do *today*  is to accept Bitcoin and take additional profits through lowering the transaction costs.

I have found that cotton wicks deliver much more flavor compared to synthetics.  The voltage/wattage you vape at can affect the experience as well.

It sucks that you've had bad experiences with rebuilding.  While I haven't tried it myself, I did read an LPT that said ""Wind around a screw that has the spacing you want for your coils.  I could see this as helping immensely, especially with a ProTank rebuild.  

The second number in a screw size (4-40, or 1/4-24, etc) describes how many turns per inch.  I think if you could find a small diameter screw with a 32-48 turn ratio, you could improve your building experience.  Try at your own risk, as I haven't.

I'd assume you'd just ""unscrew"" the screw out of your coil once you were done building it.

On the second hand, if you're replacing glass, it sounds like you're having durability issues with the way you handle your APV.  Perhaps if you were to find one of the clearomizer clones that had a glass tank ensconced within an aluminum case?  Might be worth it.

Also, in thinking about money:  Most hobbies have an initial start up cost that is much higher than the eventual maintenance cost.  I've probably spent close to 150 bucks in building to my current setup that I'm happy with.  Now that I'm looking to maintain it, I'm anticipating a cost of (at most) 20-30 a month to keep me in juice, wicks and coils.  Most of that cost being in juice, since I've started to be successful at building coils.

That is, until I find the next thing I want to try.

It's a personal choice, but as in all things, you generally get out what you put in.  More effort == more chance for success.  More money ?= a better experience.

0x_,antisrs,1389027043.0,"I think a few of them actively keep alts with which they can bounce into some SRS threads and make their contributions, that much is fair to assume. The fact is they need to, as they are not the hardline types you need to be to survive in the fempire unbenned. They fraternize with the fecalfuhrers and worse.

But there are as many who dont fempire *at all*, im a metaredditor enough to know this for a fact, there are few more still who have *some* views that are opposed to the SRS party line, and so it approaches at least half the mods who can be said to simply not qualify as candidates for fempire shills, at all.

Thats a conservative estimate. Theres a portion of the metasphere, which either by evolution of contrarianism, or just not giving a fuck, has been accepting of fempire members and so its perfectly reasonable to see a lot of the same faces, around a lot of the same places, without them being fempire robots.

I thought this was a magic place, full of guys I could relate to. I , too, wanted to be the life of the party in the cool, slick way . I read The Game and loved it, advocated it to my friends . But then... I started to think about the message of the book. 

All the dudes were complete losers, I wouldn't want to be friends with them, I couldn't be an aircraft captain with that kind of feigned confidence and asshole persona, it's just wrong. The message of the book is very clear once you get it ; You do not want to be *those* guys. It's in fact a great read, it's entertaining and well written and I do admit it's one of the books I've enjoyed the most (Not an avid reader, take it with a grain of salt).

The best thing I did for myself was cut out *all* the superfluous bullshit and theories , start lifting and go out with my friends to bars and nightclubs - Without the emphasis being pussy but being comfortable and get some killer stories to share next morning. One thing I did learn during my ""peak"" is if you want to be a ""ladies killer"" , you need to put a lot of time into it - Hell, even some luck. I once got laid in 30 minutes, because a group of Italian girls found it funny our group of guys was wearing all black shirts and I played my cards right but that will never, *ever* be the norm. It's a trap for misery if you think of it like that.

You're here for the hunt, which is fun. But you are not a pick up artist, and you don't want to be one. You want to be an interesting fun guy with cool hobbies and stories. 

I'm not saying it's a waste, most of you here don't have a lot of contact with potential partners - You're either in a male dominated area, not many friends growing up , mostly dudes in your friend circle , etc. and the answer isn't lying on the boards from dudes wearing fedoras and 'pea-cocking' . The past dates I've been on, I met while walking my dog - I didn't do any 'game', I was dressed in work attire or casual lazy running gear. I just smiled, asked her name, didn't take too long lingering around , and added her Facebook for another chance to talk and meet up .  

In conclusion - gym up , smile a lot and be interesting .

When my little brother was born, I remember the doctor rushing my mom to decide whether she wanted a circumcision or not, saying the doctor who would be performing it was about to leave to go on a long vacation so she only had a few minutes to hurry up and decide, and just generally acting like it was a life-saving procedure that needed to be done immediately. Most doctors that I've met seem to have that mentality that nothing should ever be waited on and everything needs to be done now, now, now, so they push people into things.

Having a baby is ridiculously stressful. You're completely exhausted, already stressed out over everything that just happened, your hormones are all out of whack and going crazy, and usually still a bit drugged up from all the stuff they give you. New mothers are not the best people to make huge life-changing decisions, although they don't know that. I certainly didn't.

stampepk,YAwriters,1389027303.0,"There are a lot of great steps you can take right now to make sure you have a lovely, supportive following by the time you get your book published. 

I would really suggest that everyone be on Twitter. For Twitter, interactions are key- so many people just care about getting followers, but you really want to focus on building relationships with other authors. Start by reaching out to writers of all experience levels from both inside and outside your genre. Follow the ones who provide good content and emulate them. You can also take part in blog contests, or even offer to help look at pitches or chapters for people. There's a wonderful community on Twitter waiting to help you become a better writer and marketer. 

For your personal brand, you need to have a website. It doesn't have to be fancy (mine's http://philstamper.com , and it's about as simple as you can get) but it's a one-stop shop for agents, other writers and publishers to find out more about you. You need to make sure that when someone searches for you, they find what they're looking for.

Tumblr works for many people, though I'm just not a big fan of it, personally. There's a HUGE writing community, and I think /u/elleblair and /u/bethrevis could probably answer any questions you have about that platform. Feel free to explore any option to some extent, but focus on the ones that work best for you. There are robust author communities on all social networks, so if you really enjoy Pinterest, Vine, Instagram, Facebook or whatever else, focus on that. **You don't have to be on everything.**"

Be interested in her life. Are you not curious about how other people live their lives? Do you not wonder what she does at the weekends? Do you not wonder what kind of job she has? Do you not wonder whether she thinks Alsatians are fucking terrifying? The best way to make conversation is to be genuinely interested in the life of the other person you are talking about. Be genuinely interested in other peoples opinions of things.

On a more dating related note, the whole reason you're talking to her is to find out whether you are compatible. To find out whether your values and interests are sufficiently similar that a relationship is worth a shot. So if you're not actually interested in how she sees the world then approaching is pointless (unless you're doing it to get past approach anxiety of course).

Stop thinking ""what should I say?"", start thinking ""who is she?"" and most importantly, **find out** by talking to her."

That said, open relationships seem to be on the rise and I guess they work for some people. What I think may be at play here is her possibly feeling guilty because of her past (the cheating and the fact that her sex partners outnumber yours) and she feels like she should let you ""catch up."" If that is indeed the case, and you yourself would rather be monogamous with her, let her know that you don't want an open relationship, even if it is open only one way to your advantage.

mkhural,nfl,1389027498.0,"You're right. I apologize. Twas having a bad night.
Let me respond to your arguments in a civil manner:

1) We're injured but have been for a while so we have gotten used to it. We play well with the team we have because our injured players are on IR and we don't have to worry about them playing at less than 100%.

2) Your argument is that you guys have luck (haha) which is invalid. That is not an argument. You're basically saying that you guys only win if you get lucky and get a turnover or the like. Literally, you made the assumption that you will be lucky BECAUSE you will win. Invalid induction. 

3) TY Hilton is a problem. We can double him though with Dennard (if healthy) or Arrington and McCourtey (Pro Bowl Safety) in support. He won't be running free. We can put Talib on Fleener and shut him down. I know all about Rogers and I do not believe that he has the mental makeup to be a constant threat. There's a reason why nobody drafted him and it was because of his mentality. Clearly, he is physically gifted. Just because he had one big catch last game, a catch that everyone knows his physicality suits, does not mean that all of a sudden he is a big threat. 

4) No QB likes getting hit but Tom Brady doesn't just fall off the map by getting sacked a few times. He won't be affected by one pass rusher in Mathis. Also, Brady is extraordinarily good at moving around in the pocket. If you cannot get pressure up the center, Brady can handle this. Brady ain't no bitch no matter how much people want to paint that picture. He is one of the greatest competitors in the world. 

5) Our WRs aren't made of glass. Amendola has been fine since his groin injury. K Thompkins is back healthy after only missing a little bit of time. Dobson may have a more serious injury but that doesn't make him injury prone. If he plays though, watch out. He can stretch the field leaving Edelman and Amendola to have a field day. Also, there's no way you can completely shut down Edelman so much that your poor Rush D can stop our multi-pronged rushing attack. REMEMBER Shane Vereen can run as normal and catch from a WR spot. 

My adverse reaction was due to the fact that you oversimplified our team. I respect the colts. I understand that they play with heart and that Luck can change games. I think TY Hilton is a star. Likewise, we are no duds. You literally talked away Tom Brady with Robert Mathis rushing him. There's little to no way that happens. The offenses are going to run wild so it comes down to the defenses to step it up in important moments."

To be honest, I do think Ana (the blogger) overreacted somewhat, but I understand she was peeved for having someone call her wrong about an interpretation (since you can never be wrong about this sort of thing, in a way). Also, the fact he used back story *not in the book* to try and tell her was wrong, was a bit below the belt. Especially since the blog itself doesn't call his books bad, or anything. But it was mostly the aftermath; him getting involved in the later article, then his Twitter fans hurling terrible insults and calling Ana and Thea (who run the Book Smugglers) bullies for 'ganging up' on Ben.

The lady who wrote the Strange Horizons article, too, got some terrible stuff on Twitter, including, I believe, being told that if she didn't shut her mouth some guy would stick his dick in it.

prydek,relationships,1389027570.0,"Here's what I have to offer from a scientific standpoint in the simplest terms:

**How birth control works biologically** is by tricking your body into thinking it's already pregnant. It does this by causing you to release the same hormones that you would if you were pregnant. This is so the egg doesn't attach to the uterine wall (and also why there is a week where you have to take sugar pills, sometimes with added iron). 

**Here's where is gets pretty cool:** 
When a woman is pregnant her chemical make-up changes, AND she is also attracted to men with a different (read: feminine) chemical make-up. This is an evolutionary thing, basically pregnant women look for a feminine male who will want to stick around and help nurture their child. When a woman is NOT pregnant she is attracted to men with a chemical make-up most different from hers, in order to have offspring with the most diverse immune system possible. Cool right?

**Why this sucks for you:**
You were first attracted to your boyfriend when you were ""pregnant"", however now that you're off birth control, your body no longer thinks it's pregnant and wants to get with guys who have COMPLETELY different chemical make-up from your boyfriend. In short, you aren't attracted to him and you aren't GOING to be attracted to him until you're either pregnant or back on birth control, sorry.

**tldr; being off birth control means that on a biological level you're no longer attracted to your boyfriend. You can fix it by either going back on birth control or getting pregnant.**"

Coltonamos,college,1389027621.0,"It depends on the school. My school has an 80% acceptance rate (about) for instate. I was originally going in as a chemistry major and my AP chemistry 2 grades for the first two marking periods were both A's. I slacked off and got F's the last two marking periods. I got a 1 on the AP exam since I didn't study at all and on the final for the class I got 100% (or 98%, can't remember) and ended up with a C for a final grade. Class rank dropped and I ended up switching my major to geography because I was too lazy to want to do chemistry for the rest of my life. I wasn't denied college though and that may have been because of the major change"
InvictusRex,AskMen,1389027625.0,"No, there's a huge point.  You put effort to look good for yourself.  So you feel good.  Dressing good leads to feeling good about yourself which leads to being more confident which leads to better success with women.

thingsgetwhatever,AskWomen,1389027631.0,"Well, fear of attachment is a thing, though I'm not sure it's gender specific.  I had always heard growing up that men were the ones with commitment phobia, but honestly I've never really known any men or women with a fear of attachment.  I know it exists though.

I do think it's important to distinguish between those with actual attachment fears and those who just aren't interested in settling down for one reason or another.  The second group isn't acting out of fear, but just prefer to not be in an attached relationship.

That said, I and a good chunk of those I know have pretty deep abandonment fears which is a whole different issue."

I'll be picking up Blue Moon City, but it's a bit lighter and shorter and seems more in line with the type of abstract game I enjoy... like Ginkgopolis. I'm not opposed to longer abstract games, as long as they are engrossing and still have thematic moments. I'm not a fan of Stefan Feld games, which are filled with bits and numbers and points but not very thematic. 

...would I enjoy Tigris &amp; Euphrates?"

JARPA Program - 1987/88 - 2004/2005
&gt; The stated objectives of the 16-year 'JARPA' programme were:
estimation of biological parameters (especially the natural mortality rate) to improve management;
elucidation of stock structure to improve management;
examination of the role of whales in the Antarctic ecosystem;
examination of the effect of environmental changes on cetaceans.
**Research activity combined a randomised lethal catch (400±10% minke whales each year) with concurrent line-transect sighting surveys.** 

JARPA II Program - 2005/2006 - Present
&gt; JARPA II is focussed on Antarctic minke, humpback and fin whales and possibly other species in the Antarctic ecosystem that are major predators of Antarctic krill. **Annual sample sizes for the proposed full-scale research (lethal sampling) are 850 (with 10% allowance) Antarctic minke whales (Eastern Indian Ocean and Western South Pacific stocks), 50 humpback whales (D and E stocks) and 50 fin whales (Indian Ocean and the Western South Pacific stocks).** The research methods for cetaceans for JARPA II are similar to those for JARPA. The programme also includes non-lethal research components such as sighting surveys, biopsy sampling, acoustic surveys for prey species and the collection of oceanographic data.

That's directly from the International Whaling Commission."

I can't imagine, I go insane if there's a blackout lasting more than 10 minutes."
