Firstly,  ""feminism"" is indeed quite a disparate movement, with much disagreement as to which tools to use to reach gender equality. But I'd say the vast majority of feminists agree upon certain core values, namely that there are hidden structures working to the disadvantage of women and that these structures should be exposed before they can somehow be removed.

Second, I believe that salary discrepancies come from the fact that females have lower status - it has been shown that as soon as a job becomes female-dominated, salaries are lowered and status disappears. A good example is teaching - teaching was male-dominated at the start of last century, and was a high-status occupation in Scandinavia. Now... not so much.

Examples of women having lower status: aforementioned correlation between pay and work, prevalent ideas of females deserving to be humiliated for promiscuity or outspokenness, current modes of dress emphasizing weakness in women (men wear suits and ties to formal events, signaling power, women wear heels and tight-fitting useless dresses), and of course the issue of female submissiveness in fashion and marketing. 

There are many tiny things, like it still being ok to blurt out slurs about female drivers even though it has been proven time and time again (by insurance companies, for instance) that they are safer and more attentive drivers on average. I'm not trying to say that these things add up, I'm saying that there are many of them and they come from somewhere. This ""somewhere"" is quite subtle, and many are inattentive to it. This is, to me, what feminism has at its core regardless of other disagreements within the movement(s)."

I wouldn't be surprised if he turns his life around. He seems like a great guy.

The rest clearly had skewed views on women in general. Rather than merely being ""shy"", it seems these guys have had the idea of the importance of sex/women in masculinity thrust upon them, and thus feel somewhat entitled and angry that things haven't worked out as planned. It seems to have fed itself, leading them into isolation, further anger, and to some extent, delusion. 

As for the others, I was inclined to dislike them because of their views on women, but as the documentary went on, it was easy to see where it all came from, and how easily something like that could progress."

lit-lover,StarWars,1388665145.0,"Haha, I watched episodes IV, V, VI, I, and II today (because no work) and am watching III right now; I think I have an answer for this. I have at least a guess. 

When Anakin comes to visit Padme after slaughtering the younglings, he says, ""I wanted to make sure you and the baby are alright."" (III @ ~1hr 28min) Singular. Padme also uses the singular ""child"" in when trying to convince Anakin to leave with her. This is important to keep in mind. But what other knowledge does Anakin have before he becomes cut off from the explicit information about the aliveness of his children? He obviously knows his wife is about to give birth, and Obi-Wan obviously knows that Anakin is the father (III @ ~1hr 40min). Anakin also knows Obi-Wan knows about how Padme and him are together. Later during his last visit with Padme, he force chokes her, but she is still alive at this point. Vader even confirms this for the viewer once in the suit (III @ ~2hr 8min). However, he loses consciousness when he becomes a burnt tater tot being taken to the medical facility. The jump cuts between the two hospital scenes tell us these things are happening at the same time, but he has to ask Palpatine whether she is alright (III @ ~2hr 8min). Therefore, he didn't feel her die, and, because he was led to believe he killed her, he also unaware that there are two kids let alone one. 

Moving onto Luke and Leia coming onto the world scene and into Vader's life. (Sorry, y'all; I only have the DVDs. Just so ya know.) There are two major questions here: 1) Is a sensitivity to the Force genetic? and 2) When can Vader detect Luke's sensitivity to the Force? The answer to the first question seems to be relatively unkown (sticking to strictly movies here because I don't know many EU details), but it seems like Anakin was a special case of getting Force sensitivity because of how episode I pretty much says Shmi was impregnated by the Force and not a man. What this means is that Anakin's Force powers could be passed down genetically because of how it is a special case and how he has a midi-cholorian count literally over 9000 (20,000 to be exact). 

The second question is a bit more difficult though because the actors didn't know the whole father-son thing during the shooting of episodes IV and V, meaning we should focus on purely what was said and filmic elements (written and directed by Lucas himself) and not the acting. First of all, Vader ""senses"" Obi-Wan's presence on the ship the second he's there because of how close they once were and the latter's great power (IV @ 1 hr 6min). Vader is now gaurded and upset because of the fact that the man who had no problem leaving him for dead the last time they saw each other is close. He's also probably blamed Obi-Wan for the death of Padme after thinking about it for so long, but one thing is for sure here: he is mindful of the feelings he felt when he cut away Anakin and evolved into Vader as well as the length of time. Because it is on his mind, he will be paying careful attention to the Force. Slightly afterwards, this is confirmed (IV @ 1hr 16 mins). ""Ok, so why has he come out of hiding,"" Vader must be thinking. The next time we see Vader is during the battle in which he kills Obi-Wan. Afterwards, he steps on Obi-Wan's robe, and this is where we have to pay careful attention to the details (IV @ 1hr 32mins). A few shots later he is walking away. It cuts to the gang quickly, mainly focusing on Luke in a close shot, but then we see Vader again. He turns around and starts walking towards our heros. HE STILL SENSES SOMEONE THAT SOMEONE WHO IS FORCE SENSITIVE IS STILL IN THE VICINITY. This is why he checks the robe and starts to walk towards the source. And why does the camera focus on  mostly Luke, placing him in the shots by himself with a closer shot than the shots of Leia and Han together? Because, although Vader is aware of everyone who is in the hanger, his attention is on Luke's Force sensitivity. Then, not too much longer later, we find out that Obi-Wan has mastered the art of breaking down the barrier of death and communicating from beyond the grave that Yoda was going to teach him at the end of episode III. This would more than likely light Luke like a Christmas tree in terms of the Force, so we as the viewer can definitely conclude Vader knows exactly who is that sensitive. He sees a boy about the age of how long it has been since ""being betrayed"" by the man he just killed. If that wasn't enough, Vader probably also feels how Obi-Wan's energy has bonded to this kid and, after wondering why this kid means so much to his old master, at the very least becomes suspicious about this kid. 

Obi-Wan resurfaces again while Luke is doing the trench run. At first, Vader tells everyone to simply go to their stations and defend the ship, but this is before Obi-Wan speaks to Luke. Now, Vader knows this kid is ambushing his battle station with the help of his master, much like what happened during the podrace with himself and Qui-Gon. They were both told by their masters to trust their instincts in these moments. And these masters each had a level of confidence in them (young Anakin and Luke) that the young ones didn't have in themselves. The parallels are here to not only show the viewer exactly how tumultuous every person is inside and how easily we can be either good or evil, but also to simply give us the clues to know that Vader must be starting to make these connections himself. Therefore, he wants to start severing any connection he has to his old life, so he jumps in the spacecraft himself to finish the job.  

At exactly 1:55:45, Vader is chasing Luke and says, ""The force is strong with this one."" He then shoots R2-D2 himself. No one would ever forget that sassy little droid, which is the final fact to solidify that this kid is his son. Who else would have the exact same connections as you did when you left off? Someone who couldn't possibly leave of their own voilition and who was raised by those same individuals. Thus, son. I think Lucas confirms this when he then has a shot of Vader tumbling tail over head, thus symbolizing how this man's world has been turned--literally and figuratively--upside-down.

There is one more small detail to take into consideration. If he figures it out on his own, he knows what his own kid's last name would be, thus why he doesn't really refer to him as ""Luke"" but only as ""Skywalker"" in the beginning of episode V.

tl;dr: I go film nerd on the movies because I rewatched today, and I think Vader knows Luke's his son before Chewie gets denied a medal. "

The only way to prevent exploitation is to have a bunch of decent human beings get together. You can't argue that polygamy is a huge issue for exploitation and therefore we shouldn't have it because monogamous relationships have the exact same potential for exploitation. Unless you want to get rid of marriage or relationships altogether this sort of thing will happen. The only way to change it is to change patriarchal attitudes, which a lot of people in modern polyamorous relationships are already doing.

And really you don't have to make tons of extra laws and regulations. Every partner involved in a polygamous marriage would have the same rights as any other married couple."

IMDB's ratings are flawed to a degree, they work for a general public consensus but they aren't a substitute for watching the film yourself and deciding if it is good. 

Some low rated films on IMDB that're 7.0 and below are actually worth seeing. Take VHS, it's a 5.7 but definitely worth watching. It isn't amazing, but it was something new and interesting. Or this years The Counsellor is on a 5.8 and it is far from bad. I thought it was great with a string of great acting from the cast, maybe a bit too philosophical but for Cormac McCarthy's first screenplay, it is great.

WW_D,AskMen,1388665768.0,"In your position, I would ask myself whether I wanted to meet a woman because I'm dissatisfied with my life, or if I am truly looking for a companion. 

If you are trying to get a girl just to feel better about yourself, you are setting up for disaster. The best way to feel better about yourself is to improve yourself in some way. That said, just improving constantly, no matter your success, is not going to net you the girl of your dreams. In most places, you will have to make a move, and you can't do that unless you're searching out looking. Therefore, if you want to meet a woman because of a specific need for female companionship, I think that actively going out looking for women is a decent, and fairly enjoyable way to exert your energy. 

For your specific situation, I personally would focus on school, and wait until you finish the move to your new city before you start seeking out any kind of long-term relationship."

JumpingLove is a detractor using a shaming tactic that *will* influence young minds, no matter how banal it may sound to us. The goal of such language isn't to convince serious MRAs they're doing anything wrong, it's to make us look like fools to people who are clueless about this sub and movement from understanding why they should be fighting for Men's rights. 

Feminism's poisonous weapon is shame. The opinion expressed by this troll sends the message to a young mind that perhaps the reader should not be so quick to take this article seriously. After all, it's just a tasteless pun. I would look overly sensitive if I stick around this sub and comment. I don't want to be associated with a crazy fringe activists group that gets up in arms over nothing. 

Now look at the upvotes compared to downvotes. 21/29. This sub is infiltrated. You have feminists constantly swaying opinions with their shitty shaming language. They are subtle. They are trolls. They pose as men. They use bait and switch tactics to trick you into agreeing with them. 

I can't spell it out any more clearly than this. MensRights is infested with feminist cunts trolling you at every turn. I encourage the admins to take a good long look at the list of shaming tactics outlined at TRP and consider posting them to the sidebar.

My homebrewing stuff is actually at the brewery now so we can knockout a few experiments or pilot batches. We're actually building an electric homebrew rig that the other employees can learn on, before we let them loose on the new 1 Hectolitre pilot system we are getting.

So in short, no I dont hate homebrewing. I do hate brewing at home though. It's so much easier to do homebrew scale brewing at work on a day off. Floor drains, industrial caustic, hot and cold water at the ready, big ass buckets of sanitizer I can fully submerge everything in etc....

FBISurveillanceVan69,AskMen,1388666863.0,"She cheated on you because she was a bitch, like WhimsicalWriter said. There's nothing wrong with being quiet. Some women even find it attractive. If you feel like working on being outgoing is something you should do to help yourself, not because someone said you should, go for it. You're here to do what you want as you see fit. Granted, you should do some things you don't want for your significant other if they show that they're willing to go the stretch for you.

I'm also a quiet guy. When something needs to be said, I say it. Every now and then I have my social moments, but they're far and in-between. It shouldn't affect you at all.

Now are you the quiet, knowledgable type of guy or just people shy? To me, they're completely different.

You don't have to speak much for a woman to see your confidence. They pay more attention to the little things like gait, posture, composure in situations, etc. Of course, the stereotypical ""alpha"" male who is outgoing and sociable gets most of the attention, but being ""alpha"" isn't about either of those things. It's more about doing what you have/want to do when you want to and being confident about it.

My advice: Keep being yourself. Don't worry about the cheating bitch. A lot of women cheat. Eventually, you'll learn women are assholes just like us and shouldn't be put on a pedestal. Conversation will be much easier and casual when you come to that realization. Eventually, you'll run into that girl who just wants to sit at home, watch movies, play video games, and browse the internet. Trust me, they're out there."

buckyVanBuren,progressive,1388666872.0,"From the article:

*The mantra that executives and corporate board members have a duty to maximize shareholder value has become so ingrained that many people assume it must be codified somewhere.*

*But legal experts say there is no statute in state or federal law requiring corporations and executives to maximize shareholder value.*

Having worked in a number of nonprofits over the years, I have seen most, not all, but most corporations definition of ""maximize shareholder value"" is not restricted to the dollar value of the stock share, but includes other non-income related intangibles.

Survey on 2010 contributions( 2010, in the middle of a major recession) , including 63 of the top 100 companies in the FORTUNE 500. The sum of contributions across all respondents totaled over $15.5 billion in cash and product giving. **The median level of giving for these companies is $22.10 million dollars.**

ElDiablo666,changemyview,1388666884.0,"&gt;So, you want to turn media into a public good? I mean, yeah I'd go for free pizza over pizza I'd have to pay for. But that doesn't actually mean anything.

This is nonsense. Nothing is free. We need a system of support for artists and developers so they can concentrate on their work and not worry about taking away people's freedom just to squeeze a buck out of them. You see, I don't believe that it's automatically OK to do something just because it's possible. I'm against murder, for example, even though it is possible for people to do that. So there must be some kind of standard that we have, and we do, it's called liberty, and we have no right to make money off of people and take away their liberty. That much is simply inarguable.

So what do you do? I think we should give Stallman's idea a try to start. Check it out and let me know what you think: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNBMdDaYhZA"

Professionally (i.e work) that's correct you have absolutely no right or expectation to provide input or fairness to issues (excluding relevant laws etc).

If your boss is a jerk, tough, this isn't school you go get a better job etc. your role is to do what your boss/employer pays you to do, and you must meet his criteria for what he wants (he holds all the cards), your issues are not his concern. he has no duty to consider you (although a good boss obviously will)

In virtually everything else, you are entirely in command.

Someone doesn't like what you have done, and doesn't let you explain you can tell them to get fucked and swivel on it, they can do the same to you.

These situations, if read wrong, are frustrating for both sides so I can understand the allure of just dumping the whole thing with a condescending ""woman thinking"" attitude. But it's dumb. If you have a meaningful relationship with someone, most of the time you will know when they want advice and when they want sympathy, and/or they will tell you. 

And if you have a meaningful relationship with someone, you will also know what to vent to them about and what not to vent to them about. My teacher ex would rant about his job to me because it worked for us. But there were other things that his friends were better equipped to deal with. Same with me: I knew I could count on him to support me in many issues, but if I wanted to rant about feeling ugly and too fat and stuff, I would do so to a girl friend who knew what's it like to feel insecure because of the media and photoshop and what have you, and who wouldn't feel she fails to make me feel beautiful and desirable like a partner would.

TheCryptic,E_Cigarette,1388668627.0,"&gt;I have a solid boring dual coil build down on my nimbus (just 3 spins around each side) but I want to try to build some more exciting stuff. So i got myself and ohm reader and looked up some guides and went exploring. 

So using you ohm reader, what is your Nimbus at?  Dual coil with 3 wraps on each side in 28 gauge kanthal should be really low, like scary low with your batteries.

&gt;First thing i couldnt find was what volt my battery is? I guess it's just what reads on my battery? I have a panasonic 18650 and it reads 3.7V. I guess that's it? Can someone confirm me on this so i dont put myself in danger :(

They start at 4.2v and drop from there.  Typically they hover for a bit in the 3.7 to 3.6 range.  Don't drain them much below that, anything less the 3.2 i believe damages the battery.

&gt;Second is that i understand the chart i find online with the ratio for ohm to resistance to voltage but my ohm reader is extremely confusing... I thought i wanted around 1.8-3.5 ohms (according to the chart for 3.7 batteries) but my build ive been doing for some time reads less than 1. Isn't that in the danger zone? 

That chart is for regulated mods running standard clearomizers and the like.  The world changes a lot when you get into mechanical mods and rebuild able atomizers.  The danger zone is all about not overtaxing your battery.  You need to figure out what your amperage draw on the battery is based on your coil resistance and a fresh battery at 4.2 volts.  If you're going subohm then make sure you leave a large safety margin for error...  Unless you're running a professionally calibrated Fluke meter, which I'm sure you're not.

This is a really good question...  What is your vape?

mr_fishy,asexuality,1388668706.0,"For most of my life I didn't know anyone else who was openly asexual, although I wasn't entirely open about it either.

However, when I started college I moved to the only city that (at the time) was the only one in the state that had passed comprehensive anti-discrimination laws for queer people (including trans*, which is still really uncommon). For those of you who live in the U.S., I live in a state that has been red for the last four elections. For everyone else, it's pretty much conservative except in a few major cities.

The result of this legislation, though, is that my city has a comparatively huge population of GRSM people. My school has a large and very active queer student activity center and activism group. And I now know probably 5x as many queer people as I used to in high school, at least.

This has included several ace people. My current roommate and his partner identify as ace or demi, a friend of mine from a school club is ace, and after coming out on facebook I found out that a friend from my high school days is ace as well. We've had a lot of conversations about identity and ace issues, and it's been really great. For my entire childhood I felt isolated and lonely because literally none of my friends knew how I felt. Now, I have people I can turn to that understand how I feel about romance, sex, relationships, etc. without me having to explain a totally new concept to them.

It hasn't always gone well, however. There have still been some people who, after I tell them about my identity, have claimed to feel the same way and then it later turned out they weren't being entirely honest. One person in particular lied to his partner (whom I was good friends with) and said he was asexual merely to avoid having sex with him. When my friend later found out about the lie and told me about it I was pretty upset. This person used my identity as an excuse to get out of something, when telling the truth would have been easier anyway, and then tried to make out like he was the victim. Ugh. It's hard enough to get people to take me seriously when I tell them about asexuality - there are so many who are willing to dismiss me by saying I can't or don't actually feel that way. People like him who fake it just make things so much worse."

That would be entrapment. Active convincing is not required, the only thing that is required is that an option is made available to a person, which normally wouldn't be there. If it is provided by someone, in this case the owner of the server, and that person had the intent of placing it there with the purpose of catching people using it, that is entrapment.

The user's action is a direct result of the setup created by the other person.

It's called ""proof of intent"". It's the most used legal principle in the entire world. If you can prove it was the intent to set someone up, then it is a setup.

The person I originally replied to wrote:

&gt;Someone should make booby trapped hacks. Same idea behind what CIA did during Vietnam and what also is happening in Syria. Give enemy rigged ammo that explodes in their faces. But with Hacks.

And the topic is about a new set of anti-cheat measures which ban players for a year and mark them ""untrusted"".

So, in summary: this is about setting people up to do things that are not allowed by Valve, in order to get them banned.

så over til hvordan bli drita for 15-20 kr - lage vin.

noen steder - slik som [denne bedriften](http://www.vinspesialisten.no/index.php?valg=produkt&amp;produkt_nr=540) selger essens av vin. Denne vinen lagde jeg faktisk selv for 10 år siden, og siden de fremdeles selger den kan vi anta at den har noe for seg (snakk om flashback!:)

De vil si at du trenger mye rart og avansert for å gjøre dette bra. Drit i de - jeg lager egen øl nå for tiden og har masse utstyr, det er fordi jeg skal lage god velsmakende øl. Ønsket her er å lage en vin som er hvit/frukt og smaker som noe fruktsaft/vinsaft. Så lenge du aldri forsøker å lage rødvinsversjonen, så går dette helt greit og det smaker helt ok. Ingen feinsmekker, men helt ok.

Du trenger følgende:

* En plastikk dunk som tar 30 liter
* vannlås
* rensemillel

Det er alt. så trenger du essens pakken og muligens sukker (her står det at det er ferdig sukret). Jeg er ganske sikker på at gjær, gjærstopp og klarning følger med.

Hell opp i dunken, bland med vann og la det stå i tre uker. legg til gjærstopp og klarning i samme dunk (du trenger ikke å bytte til klarningsdunk så lenge du lar dunken stå stille på ett sted)

Bruk hevert eller ta et litersmål og sett på bordet. drit i flasker. 

Min gamle versjon var ikke ferdig sukret, så jeg satt igjen med en saftvin på 15%. 25 liter av dette til 400 kr. man blir grei i farten før man går ut.



Alternatitvt så kan du lage god øl, og bruke penger eller kjøpe tuborg som alle andre....:)

True. 

Not the 'giving a fuck'-part, but mostly underestimating the pressure of society when it comes to physical reversals in dating. Whereas friends will mostly be trying to 'mend' things when a situation occurs, there will be more who'll try to break it up, because it clashes with what they see as ideal. Parents will be less supportive, the media will be all-out ignoring *your* type of partnering, so it's actually you and your partner against the odds, without a backing framework.

That's where most nasty fall-outs come from: both parties getting riled up about the other by bystanders, instead of being reunited by them.

I'm terrified when he starts dating because I don't want his girlfriends to get the wrong impression of me. I don't like that he buys me things. I'm a proud person and having him do it makes me feel weak and needy. But if I deny the gifts he's highly offended. We've gotten in fights over it.

bubbish,AskMen,1388669591.0,"Phew, that was an intense read. You seem to be in a bit of a bind, but not with her - with yourself. All I could think about while absorbing your words were that how can you possibly devote yourself to someone when you don't seem to be devoted to yourself? I'm sorry if that comes across as harsh but you clearly have some issues you need to take care of and I'm not sure struggling for someone else's adoration is the right way to spend your time now. You say that you don't even know why you end up in your stonewalling modes and that is worrying - you should have at least some idea of how your own feelings work.

But I can really understand your feelings toward the girl. I've been there myself and it's very hard - almost inconceivable - to imagine the girl being flawed or treating you bad. But she is, trust me on this, and she is more of an obstacle to yourself than you think. She says she is ""not good with serious"" concerning your feelings for her. If she doesn't take your feelings seriously, how the hell can she claim to even be your friend? I'm sorry but that just sounds horrible the way she evades a matter which is clearly eating you up. Do you take your feelings seriously? I assume you do, otherwise you wouldn't be here. So why shouldn't she?

I'm going to stop here because I'm afraid of assuming too much about you and your relationship with this girl. But all I can say is that I've been in a situation similar to yours twice!

I'll take up arms right next to him if someone tries to take his right to free speech (which I know no one, and I mean **no one** made a realistic effort to take away anyone's rights) because next it'd be me. My people, atheists, had to fight for our right to be openly atheist and I didn't...for that I'm lucky, but back then it was unpopular - far be it from me to try to claim now that I have that right that my opinion, atheism, is the be-all, end-all.

So let's dissect this. Homophobic? No, he has stated **multiple times** he doesn't hate gays. He believes they'll burn for their sins against his deity but that's not him burning them. Whether he enjoys the thought of them burning? Well, I don't know about that. I'd have to give my opinion and I'm nobody it just comes down to us not knowing if he *wants* Yahweh to burn them.

Let's talk about the bestiality claim made by some of the religious. They make claims to other things occurring in the wake of homosexuality, but bestiality sticks out because it, too, is a prosecuted sexual act (for good reason - we can all agree no one should fuck the sheep but like anyone, if he wanted to say ""I want to fuck a sheep,"" just say it, not to shock kids or nothin' but as his political opinion, I'd fight for his right to say it. Wouldn't like it, but I'd fight for it, because he might not otherwise be there to fight for my right to pull my girlfriend's hair and hold her down in a clear rape position...which we enjoy [sex games, don't make that more than it is]). Gotta maintain your freedoms... So, why do the religious bring this up? Well, think of it like you're a manager. You've told your employees not to a: eat at their desk, b: date within the office (if you know shit about management, you know that's a good rule to have - call me a nazi if you want but that isn't the topic at hand) or c: wear headphones. Now...Jenna had a bit of trouble recently, her husband left her for her beautiful daughter that you wanted to bang once she turned 18. Yeah, shit just got real. Ok, back on topic, so Jenna's fucked in the head and you give her leave because she is not work capable. So she comes in, maybe she forgot the rule, maybe she's testing you, doesn't matter - she puts headphones on and begins her work. Now why you made the rule, I don't know, maybe you're a nazi but fuck it, that's the scenario. So, you can take this time to remind her there are in fact three rules or let it slide, she's still probably not fully recovered, that could take years but you don't remind her. You let it slide, at least for now you tell yourself. You fucking pussy. Well, the next day, since the rules have no weight Jenna or hey, fuck it, Steve, brings a soda. Soda spills, computer needs replaced. Now, this is a fucking stupid scenario because any boss would be like ""and that's why we have da rulez"" but in the case of the bible the punishment for a society of sinners is death for the society. If one rule is gone, they're all gone and don't forget that this is a group that often can't comprehend why we Atheists don't pillage and rape everything in our path since we don't have an old cloud guy telling us not to.

His misogynist comments: are actually damn close to the truth. He'd be better off bagging on single mothers in this way but let's face it, best time to find your true love - high school. Not saying marry someone before you graduate, just saying get 'em while they're young. Tactically, it's a good idea. No one's talking about 14, 15 year olds, remember.

He doesn't have islamophobia that's simple xenophobia...if it were true! He stated he loves his neighbor and that extends to the Chinese and Muslims so...what's the problem? Oh, that he believes in the bible? Well...alright, you got him there! He is not an atheist, let's all get him!

Ok, would I rather meet Christians on the road? Absolutely. We got 10 people, carrying something, nothing or specifically, a bible...a bible, man, either they are a new brand of serial killer group or I'm about to walk by peacefully. It simply doesn't happen that a young white male like myself will be maliciously attacked by a group of bible-toting men without some sort of active sin or provocation. In that I didn't recognize them, I can feel safe in that they don't know my sins...so we're good. Now if I was wearing a gay pride shirt, I might feel different but as a young white male that doesn't put political claims on his body, I'mma be fine. I will give the author that any book, realistically, is gonna make me comfortable. Some novels, I'll feel even more safe than bibles, absolutely. But I think the question is more toward would you rather meet a group of guys coming from church or a group of guys objective unknown. It's a cheap statement but it's really not wrong.

No one wake sup and says ""I hate gays, which is unacceptable unless I'm Christian so I'm gonna need a bible,"" no, you become Christian and if you actually read your bible, you believe gays burn. If you actually follow instructions, you'll attack them yourself while not hating them personally and have them killed but make sure no Christian kills anyone because that would be a sin so get a non-Christian so he can kill him in a mercenary-type situation then kill him for not converting without killing him and make sure you love him.

tl;dr quit reaching for ways to attack Christians, the old ways of talking shit on them are still the best."

Talk to the people there, show up to a few meetings, and generally embed yourself until they take you on. There are a lot of political/business/media pressures to close unions down in recent years and the unions have suffered. They often can't afford to take in as many apprentices as they once would so positions are limited.

.

Then there are community colleges and trade schools if the local unions, factories, and companies can't take on apprentices. I always tell people to try for an apprenticeship first, no tuition costs and apprentice training is the best way to gain the skill and experience you need. Make sure it's a good college/trade school program and qualifies for AWS certification tests. Be really careful to avoid for profit colleges. They are springing up like weeds and scalp people for money without really teaching you the necessary skills. I'd be really cautious about wild claims too. For instance I know a local ""trade school"" (it's a for-profit) that promises students will be journeymen pipefitters in 9 months of classes. That's absurd. As an apprentice it takes usually 4 years (or until you reach 8,000 hours of on the job training and in classroom study). 

.

Any place teaching welding will cover lots of stuff. They'll teach you about safety, Personal Protective Equipment, the dos and don'ts, and how to weld in different methods. GMAW, SMAW, GTAW, etc. You'll practice on scrap metal until you can lay a good bead, then you'll make projects, practice in different weld positions, and make something by reading and accurately fulfilling blueprints. You'll then be tested, your welds will be tested, inspected, and sometimes shipped to an AWS facility. In testing your welds will be bent on the face and back side, cut to look for porosity/penetration defects. In higher up welding your welds may be X-Rayed and given specialty tests. "

I used to work at the Costco off 14 mile and M5. After a year of pushing carts I was moved back to the deli but on one random spring day I was asked if I could push carts again.

So while I'm out there and I randomly notice a guy go trucking into the store on a walker, didn't think anything of it. about an hour later I had just brought in a row of carts and that same guy with the walker is coming out of the store and I realize it's Konstantinov. My jaw hits the floor when the lady checking the receipts asks if I can help them take their stuff to their car.

I was loading up their stuff the whole time just shocked and apparently it was pretty obvious because his wife?/nurse? asked if i knew who he was. I said yes and she says ""well thanks for keeping it quiet"". I just asked if I could shake his hand and she checked with him and he said yes. I got to shake his hand and say ""I'm glad to see you are doing so well, you were one of my favorites."" and he nodded and waved.

I just went back into the building to sit by the carts and the receipt lady asks ""hey, did you know that guy or something?"". And I went ""Yeah, that was Vladimir Konstantinov. He used to play defense for the Red Wings"". Word spread and people thought I was an idiot for not trying to get an autograph. I was just excited to see him up and moving around on his own and to get to shake his hand on top of that was amazing enough for me."

I'd say learning the m4 and ak (and the pistols - p2000/usp, glock, p250 - to some extent) is basically the foundation on which you'll start to build everything else.

Personally I'd recommend the m4a4 for newer players. Yes, it's easier to hit with the silencer but you'll also run out of bullets *really* fast as a new player.

Do note that this origin was disputed by Tolkien's later research, and that neither he nor Christopher consider the Elven origin of orcs to be correct. To me, this seems correct. It just raises too many problems for the cosmology as described in the Red Book, chief among them being whether orcs die of old age (primary sources say they do, but an Elven origin would demand they do not, since Melkor cannot change the nature of souls) and whether there's an orcish wing of the Halls of Mandos. Then there's the metaphysical stuff, like whether an orc retains free will to choose good like the Elves do.

&gt;He also created Balrogs

Also, Balrogs are Maiar spirits of fire who follow Melkor. They were not created by him, they're just Maiar followers, like Sauron is.

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1388670963.0,"&gt; I FEAR

That fear is irrational. It was for me.

For me, until college, I had this same irrational fear. Physical size and strength of aggressive men intimidated me even in ordinary conversation. Just a ""shut up for a second"" would literally get me to stfu, because there's this irrational fear that the guy would just kick my ass. Rational thought (""He can't."" / ""We have laws against assault."" / ""We're on school grounds."") didn't enter the equation. It was easy to cut me off.

Lifting helped a bit, but even that wasn't enough. I think I may have naturally been a coward.

This started going away after I took on boxing. It disappeared entirely after joining my college's team. Appropriately enough, being used to getting physically hit translated psychologically to being cool to intimidation.

(I don't know if it's true everywhere, but, outside college, actual boxing gyms were harder for me to find than MMA gyms. I liked MMA as well, but by then it was a more nostalgic endeavour for me than a practical one. So it doesn't have to be boxing specifically. Martial arts in general build character.)

Again, most of it is irrational, so logical thought any of us provide to you might have limited effect."

Arkanta,Android,1388671093.0,"I never said that iOS didn't copy Android. The notification bar is a good example, and I agree. I thought you were one of the ""omg iOS 7's look is totally Android"" guys, not talking about the features themselves.  

But you should stop being so Android-centered, and open your eyes. If anything, it's clearly a feature that Android ripped off.  

Let's have a look at the multitasking on multiple platforms :  
[Android](http://cellphonequick.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ICS-Task-Manager.png)  
[WP 7](http://www.thoughts-on-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/windows-phone-7-multitasking.jpg)  
[WebOS](http://www.thoughts-on-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/webos-multitasking.jpg)  
[iOS 7](http://siliconangle.com/files/2013/10/ios-7-multitasking.jpg) (Notice how iOS shows the homescreen as a card too. Android does not do that and does not even scroll in the same direction).  
[HEY, let's go even wilder and see how Windows **Vista** handles multitasking](http://cyber-knowledge.net/blog/images/thumbs/pics/alt_tab.jpg) (We'll forget the horrible other switcher they had, but it used previews too)

Now let's even go deeper and have a look at how Mobile Safari handles tab switching since *day one* :  
http://www.iphone3gsystem.fr/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/3.png  
Does it ring a bell ? Yeah. *clearly* something Android invented.  

So Android ripped off the multitasking previews, but at the same time they didn't because it was originally Duarte's idea, who ported it over to android. Can we please stop ""Android invented the fucking world"" circlejerk ?  

By the way, Android also copies iOS. Look at the settings, see these ""on/off"" switches for Wifi and bluetooth ? Hello ! They are coming from iOS 1 !  

**You've** *obviously* never used any other operating system than your belowed Android."

azoenophile,AskMen,1388671114.0,"Afraid to leave because he might guilt her != hostage situation. I've had friends leave their partners and call me crying because their man threatened to kill himself if she wouldn't come back. Ultimately, that's not her problem anymore. Would it suck and she feel some guilt? Probably. But his instability is not her fault. If he would threaten something worse than suicide to try and tempt her back, clearly there's something wrong there - with both of them, with the relationship, with boundaries. 

Either there's another dynamic you're unwilling to share that makes this a hostage situation, or you're making excuses for her. No matter what, she needs some time on her own to heal from an abusive relationship. 

Additionally, the advice of no contact after a breakup is there for a reason. If they're living together, she can move out when he's not there. Block his number. Don't drive by his house. It may be emotionally hard, but it's not actually a difficult thing to do. 

If she wants to break up with him, she needs to cut ties entirely. If you want to be supportive, go with her and help her pack her things and get out. Be there when she's having a hard time and encourage her not to respond to him, no matter what he says. And don't try to rush into a relationship. "

And yes the people in it are treated like they are property, using violence, and torture to enforce that ownership.

You are confusing legitimate off-shore -workers who get a raw deal (which happens a lot) with actual human trafficking.  Read on. 

The events that you described is going on in Kuwait etc. have nothing to do with the human trafficking that was described in the National Geographic documentary mentioned above. Human trafficking consists of the kidnapping and slavery of individuals from anywhere on the globe, to anywhere on the globe.



From the opening of the Wikipedia article on human trafficking:


Human trafficking is the trade in humans, most commonly for the purpose of sexual slavery, forced labor or for the extraction of organs or tissues,[1][2] including surrogacy and ova removal.[3] Human trafficking can occur within a country or internationally. Human trafficking is a crime against the person because of the violation of the victim's rights through coercion and exploitation. Victims of human trafficking are generally forced to work for or provide services to the trafficker or others. They are held against their will through acts of coercion. The work or services may include anything from bonded or forced labor to commercialized sexual exploitation.[4][5]

Trafficking is a lucrative industry, representing an estimated $32 billion per year in international trade, compared to the estimated annual $650 billion for all illegal international trade circa 2010.[6]

Trafficing in children:

Trafficking of children involves the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of children for the purpose of exploitation. The commercial sexual exploitation of children can take many forms, including forcing a child into prostitution[18][19] or other forms of sexual activity or child pornography. Child exploitation may also involve forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude, the removal of organs, illicit international adoption, trafficking for early marriage, recruitment as child soldiers, for use in begging or as athletes (such as child camel jockeys or football players), or for recruitment for cults.[20]

IOM statistics indicate that a significant minority (35%) of trafficked persons it assisted in 2011 were less than 18 years of age, which is roughly consistent with estimates from previous years. It was reported in 2010 that Thailand and Brazil were considered to have the worst child sex trafficking records.[21]

Traffickers in children may take advantage of the parents' extreme poverty. Parents may sell children to traffickers in order to pay off debts or gain income, or they may be deceived concerning the prospects of training and a better life for their children. They may sell their children into labor, sex trafficking, or illegal adoptions.

The adoption process, legal and illegal, when abused can sometimes result in cases of trafficking of babies and pregnant women from developing countries to the West.[22] In David M. Smolin’s papers on child trafficking and adoption scandals between India and the United States,[23][24] he presents the systemic vulnerabilities in the inter-country adoption system that makes adoption scandals predictable."

RochelleH,AskMen,1388671488.0,"I certainly don't mean to trivialise changing one's personality, confidence, self-esteem, etc. I know that it's not easy and that confidence waxes and wanes. I do think that feeling good in your skin is the first step, though, but this is just my (female) experience. I compete in martial arts, and when I'm out of my peak period, which is really only 3-4 kilos difference, it totally changes my way of interacting with people and destroys my self esteem. I avoid mirrors, I start eating crap, I feel shy about people looking at me, I sometimes don't even want to leave the house because I feel ""fat"". This is just my experience, but feeling comfortable aesthetically, for me, is the first step in being able to interact confidently with people and transmit confidence.

As for confidence, I agree that low confidence and self esteem are not attractive traits in men. Shyness is OK, though. 

In regards to your standards, I don't know how old you are. Again, a female perspective, but with age, I've found that a guy with six-pack abs and nice biceps has become far less important. With age, I think many of us soften, start to feel warmth from traits other than the physical ones, start to feel attracted to the feelings and sensations that the other person makes us feel instead of physical perfection. I'm not saying you should bang people you're not attracted to, but perhaps your standards will morph over time and make you more open to different kinds of women?

That's a valid concern. I was totally rooting for AAP, even when they were throwing accusations against BJP politicians. That's good.

Not just Batla House and Kashmir, even going to the extent of supporting that guy who issued fatwa against Nasreen. Surely that's cheap politics?

I'm glad they won and formed the government, despite taking Congress's outside support, but I just wish they follow ""true secularism"" unlike other parties.

EDIT: One good thing that came out of this Muslim appeasement from AAP is some of my Muslim friends on Facebook have started supporting them.

another30yovirgin,AskMen,1388671827.0,"I'm so glad someone has said this so eloquently. I get so sick of people saying that I need to just go get some hobbies, go to the gym, learn to dress well, etc. They think that if I start doing that, women will flock to me and my troubles will be over. The problem is, women *don't* flock. Sure, there are some women who will hit on men on occasion, but most are not doing it with the frequency of men and many aren't doing it at all. 

Let me paint a picture of myself here: I'm 32. I'm fairly good looking, have good thick hair, and I wear a suit to work every day. I work in the non-profit field, but nevertheless make a really comfortable amount of money. I have an Ivy League degree. I've been to over 30 countries. I sing in a choir (which, by the way, has a lot of women). I paint. I live in a great neighborhood and have a nice place, which is mostly clean. I can cook. I have good friends--many of whom are women. I consider myself a feminist--and I've got a shelf of books (which I've read) to prove it. I do a lot of volunteer work. I'm talking more than 400 hours in the last two years. I'm overweight--no getting around that--but I have a gym membership that I'm using. Lately, I've been learning to dance, and I really enjoy it. When you say ""start taking up new hobbies that will lead to you meeting women"", I literally don't have time, because I'm too busy with all of the hobbies I have where I meet women.

There are so many men out there that don't have half as much going for them, and I know that. The problem is that I am absolutely terrible at recognizing opportunities and taking them. I am happy with who I am, and I hope that some day, someone will recognize that I'd be a great partner, but I also know that just *being* a good catch isn't good enough for men."

&gt; Nope. There is a literal exchange of energy. When you stand in front of a group of people, they give you energy. Every performer will tell you about this. If you take the time to actually do it, you will experience it yourself. 

I've played music in front of a live audience on several occasions. There is no literal exchange of energy. There is a feeling of connection that can be metaphorically described as an ""exchange of energy"". But it's not a literal exchange of energy. There is a literal exchange of energy in my amplifier, and when I lift up my bass, and when the sound waves travel through the air.

If Coldhands were to be wighted and separated from the Others control through the children of the forrest, or if the children reanimated coldhands in a manner similar to the others, that would explain a lot. Of course when we burn wights they (un)die, and so how would the children have kept Coldhands reanimated if they removed him from the other's control? I don't know.

2) stop barbell squats for a while and do goblet squats with a real emphasis on form-- this will help train your body to keep more upright, back on your heels, etc.

3) when you start doing barbell squats again, drop the weight (forget ego, just do it) and focus on form-- better yet, drop the weight, focus on form, and start doing front-squats. 

Eventually when you've done number 3 for a long time and your form is good and strength is improving, move back to high-back squats, if you want.

Cautiously_Curious,changemyview,1388672352.0,"Before I recommend some sources I'd like to unpack a few of your statements, with the first being that you hate conspiracy theories. 

What do you find so offensive about conspiracy theories in the first place? Secondly, do you distinguish between actual and probable conspiracies, such as Iran-Contra, and evidentially unsupported theories, such as a moon landing hoax? Because not doing so can lead to either overplaying or underplaying the validity of a conspiracy theory.

Another point I want to contest is your assertion that the US was engaged in war in South East Asia for monetary profit. Such a view does not stand up in the face of the evidence that the political and military motivations Korea, Vietnam, etc. were almost entirely ideological; an outgrowth of the Truman Doctrine and blind adherence to the domino theory of communist expansion.

Lastly, if the whole crux of the JFK conspiracy theorist's arguments is how could Oswald possibly carry out such a difficult task alone, then those arguments have a pretty weak foundation indeed. What did Oswald do that was so difficult?

* He got a gun.
* He stood at a window.
* He shot the president.

The only one of these that is remotely difficult is taking the shot itself, which was much eased by Oswald being a highly trained marksman from his military days.

Here are some sources by investigative journalist and skeptic Gerald Posner that I recommend you look into:

* There is a great interview with him on this podcast from a month or so back: http://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/435
* Here is a live interview with him from a 50th anniversary gathering: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTsPpjKhch4

The other problem with saying ""number A is bigger than number B"" is that it doesn't say anything about how well each addresses the expenses they're directed to. Specifically, for the issue of a lack of medical professionals, how many are we lacking? What are projected estimates for how many we will need once the law's changes go into effect? What is the projected expectation for how much faster our educational system will churn out medical students due to the changes I've pointed to?

While the story alone isn't amazing, I think the way in which Bullocks character develops and how the story unfolds is what's tremendous. Also, this isn't a films with just great CGI, it has excellent cinematography and a score that follows the less is more approach. I think Cuarón’s direction really helps create a superb amount of tension and atmosphere.

I think the film does what all films try to do. Put you (the audience) in a situation that you otherwise wouldn't experience and grip you on an emotional and physical level.

To avoid gushing, I just think it is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. It's my #1 of 2013 and I would have it in line for best at the Oscars if 12 Years A Slave and The Wolf of Wallstreet didn't look so good too."

Coffee dates weeds out most freeloaders. I've only done coffee dates since I've been in College over a decade ago, and dramatically improved the quality of the girls I've met while sparing my wallet. Just asking a girl out on a coffee date gives you an early indication of the type of girl you're dealing with and her level of interest. If she looks disappointed and/or insist for something more expensive, you've already got a red flag.

It also has the advantage of keeping a dinner date for a later time. If things get more interesting with a particular girl, that dinner date will be much more exciting. Less awkwardness and nervousness than first dates. So much better set up for awesomer sex."

So the Old Gods were revered by the Ancient Tevinter as real Gods, who created the world and taught them blood magic. Almost everyone in the game will tell you some derivation of the Chantry viewpoint: that they created nothing and merely stole human hearts away from the Maker. Both of these viewpoints are ancient in origin and probably wrong, but the 'truth' has only been hinted to us in little dialogues in the corners of the game.

To specifically answer your questions:

*  Were the Old Gods just talking dragons that got worshipped?

We don't think so. Even the Chantry acknowledges them as 'False Deities' rather than anything lesser, so they are probably special in some way. The Qunari, who are potentially the most accurate (or at least unbiased) source we have, say that *""the Old Gods were like unto dragons, as the first human kings were like unto ordinary men.""*

* Why did they get buried and why are the darkspawn chasing them?

The Chantry teaches that the Old Gods stole the worship of mankind from the Maker, by directly talking to and corrupting the Tevinter Mages - which led some of them to break into 'Heaven' and blacken it. They returned twisted and reformed into darkspawn: see the DA:O intro. The Old Gods themselves were apparently cast down and buried under the earth by the Maker. We don't know why the Old Gods call to the Darkspawn in their slumber, but it's probably something to do with how the Old Gods spoke to the Mages in the past that has embedded in both groups.

* Do these questions actually get resolved?

As you an tell: no, but we are learning more and more answers. Dragon Age 2: Legacy DLC in particular has some new insight, and it looks like Inquisition might have some interesting things to say. Dragon Age is taking it's time revealing it's story, they have a larger arc planned - which is exciting.

* What happens when they run out of old Gods?

No idea. From a storytelling perspective there is almost certainly something that climaxes around the time of the last two blights, linked into the overall story. From what we know right now in lore? Well Awakening tells us that the Darkspawn have the capacity to be intelligent, so that will be the biggest legacy of the blights. Their ability to never quite be wiped out is independent of the calling, which might result in them replacing the endangered Dwarven Empire one day.

Hope this clears things up a little?"

Your body will adjust, and soon enough you won't have too much trouble hitting your caloric target.  Also, just because you can't do something like GOMAD, doesn't mean you can't use milk or other liquid calories to supplement.  Maybe try drinking a quarter of a gallon each day.  Get creative.

One of the tenets of the book is that attention/respect/desire from women is a consequence of a man being respected/better/more powerful than other men.

Thus, most of your energies should be spent on improving yourself and your life according to the metrics judged by other men.

What does ""a lot"" mean? 1 in every 4 college graduates in 2017 is a CS major? Do you have a link to back up this statement? I did a little searching. [Here's an article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/04/students-majoring-in-computer-science-trends_n_4213769.html) written just a little over a month ago that says the number of CS majors are actually decreasing. I've also read a bunch of articles [like this one](http://bangordailynews.com/2013/02/07/business/initiative-hopes-to-double-maine-universities-computer-science-graduates-by-2017/) where schools would **like** to increase the number of CS majors.

However, make no mistake about it, CS is a tough major. Engineering majors are tough. I remember all of the thermodynamics, physics, math and engineering classes I had to take. I simply don't see 1 in 4 college graduates in 2017 having the inclination and/or aptitude to get a CS degree.

ANewMachine615,Games,1388673793.0,"PvE now has another loot tier (Ascended) that requires a mix of many different types of content to get. Basically, Ascended Armor and Weapons are crafted (so, gathering), but some mats required come from open-world boss fights (so, world events), others come from dungeon chests (so, dungeons), some comes from killing champions (so dungeons or open world). Ascended jewelry comes from doing Daily and Monthly Achievements, doing Fractals (a special type of quasi-random dungeon made up of mini-dungeons, with its own progression mechanic), doing Guild Missions (open-world events that require an organized guild to complete), or doing WvW and some combination of the other things.

It's a huge slog, and a relatively small increase (5% stat boost per slot, though I've seen damage increase estimates of as much as 20% for a fully geared Ascended vs. a fully geared Exotic). But I like that it makes you do a lot of different stuff, so I've been casually pursuing ascended gear for my Guardian. My biggest complaint is that you put in a huge amount of time to lock yourself into one gear set, when swapping gear and builds based on patch changes and your context. Dungeons need different gear from WvW. WvW roaming needs different gear than WvW zerging. Organized dungeons use one build, PUG dungeons another. You get the idea, but ANet apparently doesn't, yet.

But yeah, the fight mechanics themselves leave a lot to be desired. Right now the best builds are those with the highest damage, and the highest damage builds use auto-attacks and one other attack on cooldown. Boring. The Fractals are much better-designed fights by and large (Dredge fractal excluded), and their Living Story bosses have been fantastic. They've also added a legitimately challenging open-world fight with the Tequatl the Sunless revamp, which hopefully signals better content to come. They're definitely figuring out how a trinity-less world works, they've just not gone back and fixed it in the older dungeons and lots of events yet. That's apparently been in the works for a while, though."

Dysalot,technology,1388673825.0,"Comparing a Tesla Roadster to a Civic is a ridiculous comparison. A) it was never meant to be practical (sports cars never are). B) It would be better to compare to a Lotus Elise, which I suspect would still come out favorable in your favor.

Also you are ignoring maintenance costs.An ordinary car (ICE) has oil, oil filters, air filters, belts, etc. that need to be replaced that don't in an all electric vehicle. Furthermore the brakes in most electric vehicles I know use regenerative braking for light braking. So the brake pads aren't getting used and wont need replacing near as often.

Lastly, while true that Tesla warrants their batteries for 5 years and 100,000 miles on the roadster. It's 8 years and 125,000 miles on the Model S. Further more their batteries are [lasting longer than expected](http://www.plugincars.com/tesla-roadster-battery-life-study-85-percent-after-100000-miles-127733.html). They expected the Roadster batteries to last about 100,000 miles, but they are still retaining 80-85% charge at the 100,000 mile mark.

Lastly, all electric cars at this point are either not advantageous or just about break even at this point regarding costs (overall including use). But it's all part of a process. Technology doesn't immediately start cost effective. It has to take time to develop, the Roadster and Model S were never meant to be comparable to a Civic. The Model S is closer to a Mercedes S-Class in quality and performance."
Geohump,WTF,1388673830.0,"Wow, just saw this.

Over 50 years ago, the population in the US switched over from rural to urban living. That is to say most Americans now live in cities. That means that they do not have yards, or if they do have a yard it is very small. In most urban regions there are very strict laws against leaving your dog in the yard for more than two hours.

So the reality in America is that most people who have dogs will not have a yard to keep the dog in.

Dogs instinctively like to be in a den. These kennels are something they actually like. Smart owners don't shut the doors on them. They simply tell the dog to go to the Council and the dog does. My background in dogs is that everybody in my extended family has hunting dogs. These are robust ,outdoor. Hard-working animals. And they stay in the homes with the families. Every one of them has a kennel. And every one of them uses their kennel as a safe stress free place to go and rest.

I recently had a roommate who thought they knew everything about dogs because they worked with a rescue league. It turned out they knew almost nothing about dogs. For example this douche bag would give his dog freshwater every three days whether the  dog needed it or not! In other words he only gave the dog freshwater when the tub he filled with water for the dog was dry. so this dog would have about four hours of freshwater, and then for 2 1/2 days would have to drink crap, and then have nothing to drink for about 16 hours.  He would forget to feed the dog. And would dismiss those occasions with a simple, oh she'll be OK. But this douche bag believed he was absolutely devoted to his animal and took great care of it. It turns out he was also sociopath 


Yes there are people who abuse the crate system by keeping the dog locked in the crates for a long periods of time. Most people do not do this, but there are idiots out there who think they know everything they need to know about taking care of an animal and really don't ."

But yes, it's completely possible to install windows after ubuntu. Basically the steps are to create a partition for windows with the ubuntu disk, install windows on that partition, and then fix the boot with boot-repair using the ubuntu disk again.

Or a little more detailed:
- startup from ubuntu liveCD or liveUSB. Use gParted to resize ubuntu partition and create an NTFS partition. Note the ability to use Firefox in case anything goes wrong or you have more questions.  
- Load from windows 8 CD, install to the NTFS partition you created before. Note that windows likes to restart the computer part way through the installation.  
- startup from the ubuntu liveCD/liveUSB again. go to command line and do
     sudo apt-get install boot-repair
Or, if that doesn't work (I don't remember if that's the right command), just look up boot-repair in firefox, and figure out how to install it. Run boot-repair.

And in theory it should work.

hennypen,acne,1388673928.0,"First of all, don't change your diet based on what anyone tells you on the internet.  Nobody here is qualified, because none of us is your doctor.  Have you seen a doctor about your acne?

Some studies and some anecdotal evidence suggest that milk, especially skim milk, can make acne worse.  This isn't proven or understood.  I've also read that eating a diet of foods that cause your blood sugar to have spikes, like simple carbs like ramen or cereal, can lead to inflammation, and can be bad for acne.  I don't know enough about this to really advise you.

In my opinion, adding more vegetables to your diet is good goal.  If you really mostly eat cereal and ramen, cutting milk doesn't sound like a good idea.  You need that to keep growing.  But adding in just a little bit more nutritious food might be a really good idea.  You sound like a picky eater, but a lot of people are and that's something that everyone should work to grow out of.

I'm not familiar with salt water or rubbing ibuprofen on your face (which sounds really weird to me!), but I would suggest you check out /r/skincareaddiction.  I don't think proactiv is a very good product, and they have a helpful sidebar with suggestions for other products.

But please be careful before making any major dietary changes!  Your acne probably won't be bad forever, and you want to make sure you grow healthily!"

mr_fishy,asoiaf,1388674022.0,"Most of the changes that I liked were really small, because I appreciate subtlety. But I think that one of my favorites is probably the alterations to Tyrion and Sansa's wedding.

In the books, we view the wedding from Sansa's POV, so we're getting all of her internal thought processes throughout the ceremony. During the whole affair we read how humiliating and traumatizing this is for her. At one point she was promised to Joffrey, the prince of the kingdom, whom she assumed was as gallant as all the stories made knights out to be. Then he executed her father and viciously abused her, as well as making most of the knights she would have gone to for help complicit in that abuse. She was deemed practically untouchable after her father was declared ""traitor,"" and she ends up being handed off to Tyrion, who is quite possibly the most insulting marriage proposal she could possibly be given. Not only is he a Lannister (therefore an enemy of her family), he is her abuser's uncle (so she will never be rid of him), and to top it all off he's a dwarf (which everyone in the kingdom seems more than happy to ridicule him for).

Understandably, Sansa is not happy about the situation. But she's also made it this far by the fact that she's pretty much gone along with whatever tortures the Lannisters think up for her. If she objects, she could very well be the next to die. But she can't just take it. So she fights back in what little way she can - by refusing to bow to allow Tyrion to cloak her as part of the ceremony. In her mind, she is refusing to debase herself further in an already terrible situation. Eventually, Tyrion is forced to climb on someone's back to finish the cloaking.

However, this scene only works when told from Sansa's POV. If the scene played out the same way in the show, all we would get out of it would be Sansa, for some inexplicable reason, suddenly deciding to be an asshole to Tyrion, a character that everyone seems to like considerably more than her. It would not do well in the show since we don't have access to Sansa's thoughts and reasoning for doing such a thing.

So rather than try to make the scene work as it exists, they changed it for the show, and I think it was a masterful stroke. This time around, Tyrion had a step stool placed so that he could easily reach Sansa's shoulders for the cloaking, but Joffrey being the sadistic scum that he is decides to pull it away at the last second. Then Sansa bows so he can cloak her. I love how they decided to change the scene, because it takes care of all the issues presented by portraying it from an outside rather than first-person perspective while still keeping everyone in character. In the show version we have Joffrey being a dick rather than Sansa being the one who is humiliating Tyrion, which means we don't have people feeling conflicted or irritated with Sansa when they're supposed to be relating to her. Instead, we just hate Joffrey more, which only helps the story along. Plus, we have Sansa witnessing how Joffrey tortures Tyrion just like he tortures her - this is a good setup for their later relationship. Eventually Sansa comes to like and trust Tyrion a little, despite her wariness over his lineage, because she can relate to how he suffers and realizes that he's not nearly as bad as his father, sister, or nephew. By having Joff humiliate Tyrion at the wedding, Sansa can immediately relate to her new husband; this means she's still in character as well, despite the contradicting actions her character takes in the book to movie transition.

I know that I wrote a lot about something so tiny but speaking as someone who loves literature and has studied theater techniques I just really appreciate what they did in the show to this particular scene."

The initial challenge is there as you begin at war on one front but the AI seems to always open up one in the opposite side. I like the geography as almost every culture is in close proximity , Romans to the west, Greeks to the south, barbarians and nomadic north , successors and eastern east. 

The chapter missions do see a bit counter productive, as they have you declaring war on people then out right saying in the description that historically macedon lost and this war was part of their undoing.

Starting diplomacy has you client state or defensive allies with Athens and Sparta, and on bad terms with Epirus .

I distinctly remember recognizing the use of CGI in Aladdin, which came out two years earlier in 1992 (if anyone needs a refresher, it's in the ""escape from the Cave of Wonders"" scene, when they nearly run straight into a rock wall; that wall is CGI). So that type of stuff was already being explored. Did it just take until 1994 for the tech to mature enough to start playing a prominent role in more mainstream movies?

edit: [Here's the shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W-mpUPWSBU#t=1m42s), for the curious.

Diffie-Hellman,HomeImprovement,1388674206.0,"Learn the elements of classical architecture.  This looks more like a midcentury house than a mission revival or arts and crafts house.  The old craftsman houses are my absolute favorite and have a few elements to them such as wide, simple baseboards and casings, tall windows, 9ft ceilings, tongue and groove wainscoting and chair rail, simple cove mouldings, classical elements of plinith blocks, pilasters, capitals, and cornice on doorways, rosettes, etc.  

The historic houses around here are protected by the historic commission of rich people.  They usually dictate what color the house can be, outside features, and I believe bar major interior changes.  One of the greatest things with these old places is usually the original moulding.  It may have layers of paint, but it was all hand crafted and hand installed.  I love it.

Sony, at least, already allows you to play online only free-to-play games without requiring PS+.  
  
Additionally, it's more like a mutually beneficial marketing ploy, if TESO is very successful both of them will want to be the premier console for that game.  Considering how successful Skyrim was on the 360 and PS3, it doesn't seem that farfetched that either company would make that 'sacrifice'.  
  
The idea here isn't that either company would be losing anything by allowing TESO players to not require Gold or PS+, but rather they might stand to gain a lot of players.  It's more of a gamble than a straight up sacrifice.

Ninja Edit:  
  
Let's not forget that every new player for either console this early in the generation is a huge gain for either company.  They're going to bank on new players purchasing games over the lifetime of the console, they're not just looking at this as the impact of one game, but the potential sale of dozens more.

Dajbman22,AskMen,1388674384.0,"The sex robots are way too far off to begin to speculate, since society could shift enough on its own between now and when such technology is commercially viable (and I would put my money on it being 3 or more decades before this point), so I will focus more on the Oculus Rift, which is much closer to widespread commercial production.

First of all, while a major step up from the VR headgear seen in the late 1990s/early 2000s (which has rightly faded away from serious use), Oculus Rift is still stuck in the uncanny valley. This will be fine for a good number of consumers, but not enough to really win over everyone as giving a true virtual experience of ""reality"", especially for the purpose of getting off. 

Let's assume a somewhat near future Oculus Rift-inspired next gen technology is tweaked to an more streamlined experience and priced at a general consumer level (lets say at the price point of a smartphone/tablet with similar incentives commonplace today). The VR would be general use, but able to be used for VR porn functions with attachments fairly easily. 

I say it would have about the similar impacts to human interaction as both the explosion of the internet (first from mainly computer geeks and the affluent to the majority of the ""first"" world to now globally and across all but the lowest international SES's) and the explosion of smartphones with video chat capability. It will change parts of the dynamics of relationships in the younger generations for either a small majority or just a visible, more affluent minority and in the media. Facebook and other social media are a major part in courtship and relationship communication for a lot of people these days. Skype video chats, ""sexting"", facetime, SnapChat, and similar visual (or written) communication platforms are now common parts of sexual exploration between individuals who may or may not have an IRL courtship. Sites like Omegle, Chaturbate, /r/gonewild, /soc/, and the such are hives for people who prefer this sexual interaction with others primarily online (although many at least attempt to make that IRL jump, often unsuccessfuly). That visual stuff is just a continuation of the primairly text-based (with the occasional slow-loading JPG or WMV) IM and chat room fraternization of web 1.0. As more people have access to it, each became more accepted in society as a whole, but they all seemed to fill the same niche, which I feel the VR-based cyber-sex will fill as well. Thus, while it may become slightly more popular, it's just a flashier, more exciting technology filling the same need that people are already filling elsewhere online. People will look back to our time and think ""damn, how did I get off with just staring at a 2-D video chat with a girl with no vaginal attachment in only 1080?!?"" just as many now feel they were using too much imagination going off a text description of oral and a fuzzy shot of a woman in a bikini who may or may not be the person they are typing with.

For those who would primarily use it with 100% virtual programs (not for interacting with a live human on the other side), I feel its still newer, better technology filling an existing niche. Sure some borderline cases where they currently have a waifu pillow with a vibrating fleshlight but sometimes goes out looking for actual interaction may be satiated with a more interactive and immersive   VR. There will also be a few more brought into the fold of using this where they wouldn't have used any technology get off before. In the end, though, it will just be one more, slightly more advanced tool to jack off. People have been using things around them to improve masturbation since the first tools, and society always finds a way to incorporate it. "

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1388674817.0,"This reminded me of a quote from ""The Last Lecture"" by Randy Pausch:

&gt;Do not tell people how to live their lives. Just tell them stories. And they will figure out how those stories apply to them.

I usually like sticking to this when I can - I don't necessarily do that here because it's tough to tell these long stories, but in person, when my friends ask advice, I tend to tell stories.  I think it's less offensive if there's a potential soft spot as well.  For example, I have a friend that basically becomes missing when his girlfriend is around, which sucks.  It might not be that easy to take in if I tell him straight up, but if I explain how it was when I have acted like that in the past, then it's not only easier to digest, but he'll probably understand better and think of it less like an attack.  I'm not saying, ""don't do this"" - I'm saying, ""I've done this before and these were the results.""  If he doesn't like those results, then maybe he'll change his tune.

But to better answer your question, I think people to tend to stick to their ideals.  Ever notice how a lot of people like to say that they're great at giving advice for everyone but themselves?  It's easy to give advice, but it's harder in practice.  

For example, I have a friend who was recently in a position where he REALLY needed to break up with his girlfriend and he knew it.  But he couldn't do it.  Had someone else been in his position, I know for a fact that he would have told them to break up with their SO, but it took him *months.* It's easy to give advice when it doesn't affect you at all, but when making a decision is going to affect your life in some way, then you may end up making very different experiences which don't necessarily line up with your ideals."
IAMTHEDEATHMACHINE,TheRedPill,1388674818.0,"The *idea* behind unicorns is that they're rare -exceedingly rare- hence the monicker.

How do you know you've never met one? You admit that you're still learning RP (as we all are, to a degree). How is it that you're certain that you've been unable to identify the traits in *any* woman that make her a potential unicorn?

They're rare. Also, I think it depends where you're looking. In my opinion, if you're meeting women in clubs/bars, you're probably a lot less likely to find a good girl there. 

&gt;At this point I'm thinking that if there are not many unicorns, then I might just try and make myself homosexual. I already am slightly bi I think, with effort I reckon I could force myself to become gay and therefore no longer have to deal with women.

Dude, what? There's nothing wrong with being gay. But bi or not, you're walking a dangerous line if you think you can ""force"" yourself to ""become"" gay. I think you need to worry less about finding a unicorn and focusing more on which gender you want to stick your dick into. Get that figured out, then start looking for your unicorn."

Drunken_Black_Belt,relationship_advice,1388674902.0,"Sorry to be Tardy to the party, but I went through the exact same thing with my ex.

I am an atheist wtih certain buddhistic leanings.  She is a born again christian.  Things would heat up, then she felt guilty.  She didn't want to dissapoint her God, or family.  I was her first series relationship, and she saw it going all the way. 

Id like to tell you I have answers for you.  In the end, what broke us wasnt the lack of sex, but her being unable/unwilling to talk about the serious issues (including sex).  We broke up just before thanksgiving.  However we've gotten together and talked things through, and with some hard work, I'm hopeful things will get better.  

In the end though, I realized something. Yes, sex if important and fun and great when you're with someone you care about. And that's the main thing. Sex is only important if it's with someone important.  Otherwise it's just masturbating with someone else's body.  And throughout a life with any woman, sex will be there, and at other times it wont.  it happens.  The main thing is to make what you do have important. And that is what you're looking for, same as I was.  It's tough not feeling trusted enough to take someone you care about away for a night or weekend or vacation or what have you.

She also needs to open up.  Sure, God comes first. I get it. But if God is the only person she needs then she can devote her life to the church and forsake men. Obviously that isn't what she wants.  And so she needs to be willing to let you in as well, emotionally and physically.

Talk. Talk to her bout her feelings, wishes, apprehensions, desires.  It's what I'm doing now and everything is going great.  And show her this passage from the bible 1 Corinthians 7:12-14 ""To the rest I say (I, not the Lord) that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her. If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. ""

We survive and prosper, our ability to abstract a part of the reason why. I would argue that it is one of the most important traits of human beings. We couldn't have hunted down larger prey without abstraction, for example. So, as it goes, people who fail to abstract die and those who succeed live. Evolution 101.

mr_fishy,lgbt,1388675097.0,"Honestly, though, the academic discourse isn't even the problem so much as their misapplication of it - the idea that having a penis gives you privilege is true, even in the case of trans women, because for at least some portion of their lives trans women are raised as male. So while they are living as male, they do have privileges women don't. But that changes once they start to transition because people start to perceive them as female. If people assume you have a vagina they will treat you like they treat anyone else with a vagina. And this is what makes it so hard for trans women - they're getting misogyny from people, and if they don't pass well or are outed they have to deal with transmisogyny too.

But for some reason radfems can't see this. Having a penis doesn't mean you are always perceived as male, and unless you are perceived as male by society you won't get the privileges associated with having a penis.

People evicted because of not paying mortgage have their own big part of resposibility, but do not forget that during the real state boom in Spain banks were giving away credits in an absolutely irresponsible way - because they knew they would be going to win in one way or the other. = they are too big to fail.

That in a country with a corruption plague so extended like Spain no banker has ever gone to jail could seem surprising, but when you know that the day one banker was declared guilty and went to jail, a few months later the previous government decreed a pardon for him.

I was tight with my group back in high school, but with divergent career and schooling plans it doesn't feel the same as it used to, and probably never will again. Sometimes, you just have to let it go.

Here's my advice: keep yourself busy with school and club activities. Force yourself to talk to people, observe how to be good at small talk, etc. Learn how to be witty, and being laid back is an option too. It's just something that comes with practice.

Now, you feel lost, right? Here's the thing: you've just walked into an open clearing of sorts, no longer on the worn-out path you trekked on for these past years. You have a multitude of options in front of you, and it's up to you to choose which one you take. The road behind you is closed, now, but you've got to keep going.

More dense food may be needed to start off and you may feel like you are force feeding yourself.  Track all of your calories in, MyFitnessPal.com can help here.  How many calories?  Google ""TDEE Calculator"" and chose an activity level that does not include your exercise or weight lifting, but is accurate to what you do during the day.  Add 500 per day to start.  Make sure to log your weight lifting and exercise into MFP or another calorie tracker and EAT BACK THE CALORIES YOU BURN on top of the 500 surplus over your TDEE.  Not gaining strength?  Go higher.  Gaining weight and looking flabby in the mirror?  Back off some calories.  It is a process of fine tuning."

HE is the one that's making this about her ex (and so are you for that matter).  She's only talking about her life, which is perfectly natural.  *Anyone* would talk about things like what they do for fun, and what she's done for fun in the past 3 years has been affected by her ex, but that doesn't mean she can't talk about those things.  You put ""with her"" in bold, and yet, nothing was brought up by her about the ex.  You're the one unnecessarily expanding here.  

I mean seriously think about it.  Just as an example, something that gets brought up a lot in conversation is travel.  I've traveled a lot, and some of my big trips (and jobs) have been while traveling with an ex.  I don't bring up the ex, I just talk about the travel and the job.  These things are correlated to my ex, are they not?  But I don't see why I shouldn't bring these up.  And I can almost guarantee that not a single person in here would have a problem with these stories, because so long as I don't make them about my ex, it's not a big deal.  Even if she asks if I was there by myself and I said no, I was with an ex, not a big deal, I'm just being honest.  But if somehow a lot of money were involved, and that money came from my ex, everyone would lose their shit.  It makes no sense.  What's the big deal?"

For the vast majority of men, it's not that ""all they want is sex"", it's that ""they all want sex"". Many men are looking for relationships."

And I believe its prohibited by Steam to *sell your account. I don't want to be responsible for you getting banned :P , so my gut says no. 

One could argue that you don't need to sell your account to sell your license. But as we know steam does not provide said functionality. Maybe via a customer service request, but I haven't tried that.

I've also think that steam will not implement it so far, there have been rumours about it but I as far as I know there is no real system going to be implemented for this. Naturally if someone has some info about this feel free to jump in and prove me wrong/right ."

RochelleH,AskMen,1388676051.0,"You're young still. There's nothing wrong with being 25 and shy... Yeah, maybe the women you're currently interested in aren't attracted to shy guys, but do you really want to be with women that shallow, then? Maybe you do now. Maybe you just want to get your end wet, and that's cool too. I'm 30 now, and at 25 I was completely attracted to hot guys. I mean models and 6-packs and all that crap... and most of them, admittedly, were fuckwits. They got a lot of pussy, but they reveled in it and eventually the arrogance is tiring and ugly, and most of them have ended up as total dropkicks as a result of relying on their physical prowess for too long. The loveliest guys I know lived a reasonably ""quiet"", humble, 20s period. They used their time wisely, studied, got hobbies, grew out of their insecurities, and got over their hangups. Physically attractive girls *don't* necessarily just go after the ripped assholey Alphas, but there is a phase in their lives that they do. Don't we all go through that phase, where nothing is more important than bedding someone that's ""hot"" as a first priority?

Seriously, you exercise 6 days a week? That's great! If she said that you shouldn't be shy, I'm pretty sure she was eluding to the fact you've no reason not to be confident with women. Take it as a compliment, although of course it'd suck to have someone want to change you.

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1388676074.0,"Nationality questions will always be hard here. I've been in UK 1/3 of my life meaning I'm getting more British now than Polish. I know however that I was born and brought up there, know my mother tongue better and feel sentimental about Poland. To a question what's my nationality I would say Polish but if I get naturalised in UK I would say I'm both Polish and British. When I come back from a holiday in Poland I feel however that I'm at home now....

I'm pretty sure plenty of Poles already enjoy British culture. I loved a group ""Pet Shop Boys"" since I was a kid and imagine how happy I was when I saw them at O2 last year - too me it was really epic. I think the question here is exactly what the culture is and what particular people enjoy the most. You will see me going to cinemas, concerts and watching a birth of the Prince George but I won't be attending local pubs (if that can be somehow used within culture) nor going to Notting Hill Festival, simply because I don't like such things.

Poles may not be fully engaging with the culture because of different reasons: money (it is very often quite expensive), time (they normally work full times and during days off may prefer more resting than going out somewhere) and language (if you can't understand things it makes it less important to see/read something). I'm more than sure that only very few of them don't enjoy at least partially some aspects of British culture. After all this is a United Kingdom with its Queen and London and famous musicians etc. Being in UK and not seeing at least some things which UK offers is just a sin!"

grillkohle,askscience,1388676162.0,"I agree, it all depends on the environment you are living in.  
In Germany, where PV got a massive boost after Japan 2011, the terms for energy storage are not as bad as probably in the US.  
For homeowners, you can buy a small storage to use energy at night, because it is cheaper to use your own electricity (instead of feeding it into the grid) than to use power from the grid when you need it, or to store energy you can't feed into the grid because of grid limitations. (feed-in tarif for PV nowadays &lt; your standard home-energy contract) (if your grid operator can't remote control your PV, you can only feed 70% of peak power in). Plus you get really cheap loans and maybe subsidy from the government.  
It is a bit difficult to explain here, but there are some reasons to do that.  
On a larger scale, there are many storage research projects here (one I am working on), for different scale storage. Nowadays, the focus is on short-term storage for a day to a week time. In 2030, Germany aims to have &gt; 50% renewables, and then we will need long-term storage for several month as well as short term storage. It is a complex problem but we are working on it.  
While the obvious spots for pump hydro storage are already in use, there are other technologies we explore, for example underground pump-hydro storage in old mines, power-to-gas (in several different ways) or large scale lithium-batteries.

SAMElawrence,learnprogramming,1388676179.0,"The workarounds to physical RAM, I'm assuming are temporarily writing to disk to create more virtual RAM (what happens when your computer slows down). With SSDs, do we really need discrete RAM anymore, and if so, why?

So, if a 32-bit iPhone (or any device) and a 64-bit device share the same amount of physical RAM and all other specs are the same, it seems to me that the 64-bit device would perform more *poorly* than the 32-bit device because every single one of its processes would be forced to using more memory all the time. Yes? No?

It seems like leaping to higher memory architecture requires a necessary increase in hardware power, but maybe I misunderstand something about how those chunks of memory pass through the CPU ( I certainly don't properly understand memory / thread handling, or how CPUs really properly work).

ANewMachine615,AskHistorians,1388676181.0,"I think some greater context would show that you're adding nuance where it's not warranted. The decision to intern the Japanese was actually primarily the decision of a single man: Lt. General John L. DeWitt. Now, it was enabled by Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, but DeWitt was the one who turned what could've been a localized order (excluding the Japanese from specific military bases or sensitive areas) into an order excluding them from the entire West Coast. He felt that the lack of sabotage made sabotage more imminent, not that it demonstrated that it was unlikely. This is mostly from memory, but the [Wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_L._DeWitt#cite_ref-candr_3-0) backs me up.

The fact that the internment might have had a side-effect of protecting the Japanese from racist violence is hardly relevant to the discussion of the considerations, when the sole reasons given by the main architect of the policy are military ones."

**You shouldn't feel guilty. You should feel empathy.**

Many blacks, for example, live in squalor. Chicago is a breeding ground for gun violence and gangs. Many (perhaps most) of the ""culprits"" are black men. They live with practically no good education, high drug use, high gun use, gangs that induct children at young ages, street prostitutuon, and many other heinous facets of the city and its system. 

The big question: **Why are blacks in these awful situations?**

Because your ancestors put them there. 60 years ago, a black person could **not**, I repeat, could **not** gain entrance into white suburbia. So he went to the slums. The civil rights moment kicks in and BAM, literally with one singular court ruling, blacks and whites now must live in co-existence. But is it that easy? Do the black individuals just pick up their things and move into white suburbia?

No, they don't. And they're still there, today, because of policies 60 years ago.

It probably hurt even more because in the same breath you told her you have feelings for her, but still won't give her a shot. Such a mixed message is incredibly confusing and troubling to hear. She may be pulling back because of that.

3. I assume you told her the specific reason *why* you don't want a relationship with her. I fully understand your reasoning to avoid drinking and drinkers, alcoholism is ugly, but is it possible upon telling her, it came across more judgmental than you intended (as well as implying her social drinking is equal to the harm the alcoholics in your history did to themselves and you).

Gertiel,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,1388676325.0,"I'd like to comment that working retail isn't necessarily a bad thing. Some people make a life doing just that. As an example, I have a friend that worked his way up to manager of one of the major big box stores. He makes an extremely good living - I understand the job pays around 70,000 - 80,000 a year if you're decent at it- doing that. And he's great at it. It sounds like maybe that isn't what you want to be doing with your life, and that's fine, just felt like it is a shame people discount obvious possibilities they might enjoy.

Other than that um. Well, I don't really wish to be a negative nelly, but I hear library science isn't something with a lot of opportunities. My information comes from a friend who went into that field oh about 10-12 years ago, and from what she said it was a bit location dependent so maybe you'll have better luck where you are. Just saying you should research into that before you put a lot of effort into it maybe? 

What about a teaching certificate? What with your combo of English and Art and the economic problems schools have been having, maybe they'd hire you to teach some English classes and some art classes? If you don't think you'd like working with people that young, maybe a college teaching job? 

I really don't know about much in the way of opportunities for English or Art majors otherwise outside of possibly getting into commercial writing. A friend's daughter who got her degree in English makes quite a tidy sum writing the manuals that come with certain electronics. Apparently the Engineers who design them aren't really all that great at conveying information about them on the level of your average Joe who buys the stuff. Who'd have thought of that?

Chalkface,dragonage,1388676373.0,"Glad to help. You can learn most of it through just playing the game and taking some time to read the ingame codex entries, but I know that's not preferable for everyone. [There is a very well maintained wiki](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Lore) that even covers what some of the writers have said on the Bioware forums, but be aware that spoilers are rife under those little ""DA:O content ahead!"" paragraph covers.

The reason that no-one else comes to help is down to a few things: 

* Firstly, only the Grey Wardens believe this is a blight, so no-one else is particularly worried. It is stated about the 4th Blight that so many darkspawn were massacred in the final battle, few believed that they would ever return. And that battle was three hundred years ago. Without actually seeing the archdemon, even the Warden groupie King Cailan isn't convinced.

* Next, because of political concerns at Weisshaupt, the First Warden can't micromanage every Warden Commander (Duncan) anymore. Add to this the time taken to get messages sent out from backwater Ferelden, and Duncan is basically on his own until he actively requests help and confirms that the blight is here. He doesn't because Loghain is adamantly against it, and he understands that as a Warden he can't throw his weight around because of the dangerously thin ice that Cailen was walking on at the time politically. He needs every ally he can get.

* Adding to the messages, if you ask Alistair ""Why don't we just find more Wardens and get them to do it?"" he correctly guesses that by the time they reached Montisimmard, the Orlesian Warden HQ, and return with several legions of Wardens and Orlesian Chevaliers, Ferelden will be wiped out. Perhaps they might have managed it if they weren't being actively hunted by the state, but in the circumstances they had to work within Ferelden."

Very interesting that there are established libraries for splitting up very large numbers. Part of my curiosity is because the company I work at has some very old software that I will have to learn over the next 6 months, and some of the encoding is so ancient that a number like ""1985"" has to actually be split up into a ""19"" and an ""85"". They explained it to me once, about how it's all single byte binary, but I still don't fully understand it.

I'll be working on a product, mostly written in C# that has some of these constraints because it interacts with *really* old IBM log data formats, so I will actually have to know how some of this stuff works.

What you said about compiling making the difference makes sense, but since everything I do is in dynamic languages and I never have to compile anything, that's a bit over my head (but I understand the concept).

If I had a dog and I didn't see it for two years, then when I saw the dog again it would be very excited and happy, not angry and confused. This is how Sherlock saw John, not due to lack of respect but due to lack of understanding. He really seemed to believe that seeing him again would erase all of John's pain and that they could be best pals again. This is due to his appearant Autism or awkwardness or whatever you want to attribute it to. 

As far as the bomb goes, I think Sherlock was genuinely terrified until he found the off switch. Then once he knew they were safe he felt he had an opportunity to prove a point, the point that John did miss him and despite his conflicted feelings he's glad to have him back.

citadel_lewis,DebateReligion,1388676605.0,"&gt;The OP has stated that a 15 year old's conception of theism is not relevant. 

He stated that a 15 year old would have a 15 year old's understanding of theism, not that it was irrelevant.

&gt;Of course, this doesn't prevent folks from including 15 year old's in a census of religious belief.

Nor should it. Refer to above.

&gt;In short, the OP seems to be claiming that a 15 yo can be religious for good reasons

What good reasons does he say contribute to a 15 yo being religious? I don't see them.

&gt;but if they're atheist then that's just because of bad theology. 

He said it was ""likely"" to have ""contributed"". A bit different to how you represented it, but still a big stretch logically. I don't think it that likely.

IAMTHEDEATHMACHINE,TheRedPill,1388676621.0,"&gt;I don't really feel attraction to men

If you want to date dudes, I think this will cause a problem for you.

Look, if you think dating men is going to be a picnic compared to dating women, you're wrong. Ask a gay guy. I have gay friends (who are quite RP), who are pretty fed up with their dating pool when it comes to a LTR. [See this post for context.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1u6grf/i_am_a_former_beta_gay_man_who_is_now_an_alpha/)

&gt;I guess I am just having really trouble accepting the fact that women are seemingly incapable on the whole of loving men in the same way we love women.

This is a tough notion, because ""love"" is a huge and confusing concept. Whether or not women can truly love men is up for debate, especially in this community. But I would offer you this challenge: Why do you *need* a woman to love you? Or a man? From what you've said so far, it seems that you're so desperate to be loved by *anyone* that you don't even care at this point if it's a man or woman."

WowMilfy,AskReddit,1388676631.0,";-p Thought it was clear (Aussie men are mostly uncut now, those under 30 or so and women in America have mostly only seen cut dicks, sorry that I didn't make it that explicitly clear before), that I'm in agreeance with you. I'll edit that I'm uncut. She's only really had cut guys before and she didn't really like it, or didn't realise how bad it was until she had me a few times and noticed a difference. She loves foreskin now. She didn't know what she was missing.     

Also, I'm half her age, and she's only been with a few guys younger than her, so that might also be a contributing factor. But the other Younger Men were cut just like her husband.     

Edit: as for 'better lovers'...sex isn't just the mechanics of it, especially for women, it's the emotional connection. So perhaps to be fair, she could be biased, I'm not saying she's lying or that I'm the best thing since sliced bread (no pun), but it all adds up and she's said that the fact that I wasn't cut most likely makes it all that much easier to be better.

Getting any help (especially before 1989) wasn't possible. I'm too young to remember communistic times but from my parents and grandparents heard about stories when you had to ask a lady in a meat shop to leave a peace of meet when it arrives; as a favour for her you will sell here some cigarettes when they arrive in your shop. My my told me that when she got some fruits she was really happy as then she could give them to me.

Even after 1989 it wasn't really good. In fact, it seemed for many like much worse (unemployment rose very high). You could buy many more things.... you just didn't have money for them. So you had to be really operative to make things work, otherwise you wouldn't have anything to put on your plate for dinner.

Thom0,videos,1388677002.0,"Computers are just another tool or medium, composers composed on the piano due to its universal applications. DAW's do the same thing, it works as a unified work station to compose from. Is there a statue of the piano Mozart composed from or the paper he wrote on? Nope, the workstation never replaces the person so even implying that the mouse would take importance over Mozart if he existed in today's age is just stupid.

Has this had a negative effect on the quality of the music being produced? Absolutely and thats the real issue, not the existence of the DAW's themselves. DAW's let people who don't know the technique of an instrument play and record them, a guy who hasn't got the faintest clue of how to physically play a drum kit is going to be very limited in terms of creativity, feel and realism. A guy sitting alone at his computer with basic melodic theory is going to be limited in what he/she can record, its not going to be the same as the real thing unless they develop skills in what ever instrument they are attempted to reproduce or if they work with others who know what they don't know. 

Anyone can tell a mile away the difference between a programmed instrument and an instrument with a proficient player behind it, that us assuming you don't have someone like Pino Palladino, Jojo Mayer or Josh Freese recording. Then its anyone's guess.

Mozart or any other composer had the same issues only they had the luxury of needing an orchestra to perform the piece. Mozart didn't know how to play a trumpet, a violin or a timpani. He had an idea of what he wanted, wrote it then presented it to people who are technically adept to perform. If you don't think Mozart worked through his pieces with his orchestra's then you're mistake.


People who are proficient and have the extra knowledge gain fame and recognition, without DAW's we wouldn't have guys like Jon Hopkins, Trent Reznor, SBTRKT, Trifonic and Bulb (Periphery fame). All of these guys have technical knowledge that extends above and beyond being able to play guitar or piano. They can play what they want to hear to a certain extent or they know what its like to physically perform on that instrument, obviously you can make things in DAW's that otherwise cant be replicated on an analog workstation and that's something incredibly amazing in its own right.

Honestly, I could write a 5000 word essay on why your logic is, respectfully, wrong.


TL;DR: I may of gone off track but making short of long, you're wrong. If you're good, you're good. It doesn't matter if you use a piano or a DAW. If you think Mozart could write NIN stuff then you're a fool, he thought and worked in a different era. That doesn't make him any better or worse than a modern recording artist and using a DAW doesn't make you any worse or better than Mozart."

For the last month, I've been hearing vendors steer people away from the PT3 because of ""bad leaking problems.""  Well, I've had the same thing happen on my 2, so I don't know how much worse the 3 is.  Maybe I'll stick my neck out and try it myself some day.

Now, the PT2 is a solid tank, and once you go through a blister pack of atomizers to find one that doesn't cause you trouble, it's pretty good.  One of these days, I'll supply up and start rebuilding mine.  I hear this makes a magnificent difference.

Couple of things to remember:

Don't crank the tank (510 connector) down tightly to your battery.  You will self-insert airflow and leaking problems.  All you need is electrical contact and enough stability so you feel comfortable with the tank on the battery.

Watch some youtube videos about dry-burning or cleaning your coil.  You will want to do this once or twice a week.  This will greatly extend the life of your atomizer/coil, which is money-saving.

Other maintenance?  Clean it now and then.  Take it apart and soak the tank overnight.  If you prefer pure hits when changing liquid flavors, this is a necessity. If you don't mind mixed hits, just fill the tank up after you've emptied any old liquid out.  It will sort itself out in about 15-60 minutes of vaping.  Also, go after the 510 connector threads and air-holes with a q-tip if they start looking cruddy or black.  

Now, so far as the the iClear, I'm sure the tank is probably about as buggy as any other out there.  It's hard to find the perfect tank, and it probably doesn't exist for everybody.  If you're willing to take some time and learn/figure out some tweaks for it, it will probably work well for you.

TIGit,jobs,1388677239.0,"Talk to people. Approach someone say how much you respect their accomplishments/work and mention how you'd love to hear more about how they got to where they are now. You're not asking for a job, you are in essence asking people to brag about themselves to an eager listener. Almost nobody turns that down, people love to talk about themselves. And it flatters them to have people show respect and wanting to know about their achievements. 

Then sort of sprinkle in this killer ""Can I ask you for some advice?"" People love giving advice, it makes them feel knowledgeable and respected and puts them in a power position. After they say yes then ask away about the industry.

Don't make it about wanting a job, make it about that other person. They'll remember you more fondly if you make the feel good about themselves.

&gt; I feel embarrassed for bringing a girl I was super proud of and really liked a lot to meet my friends for the first time and have her act like that

Everyone should be proud of their SO! There is nothing that suggests he's proud of her because he considered he some kind of status symbol. He also said early in the post how excited he was to spend the New Year with her and his friends together. There is *nothing* in the post that suggests he didn't want to be with her or spend time with her - in fact, part of the problem is that they weren't spending time together: she was sitting along on the couch and refusing to interact.

Also, you're only engaging with certain facets of his response to her. She *was* an inconvenience. She repeatedly lied about her emotional state when he was clearly concerned about her and offered to change the night's plans, bring her home, or adjust in whatever way she needed to feel comfortable. There is nothing about his reputation in his post at all, so I don't know where you got that.

&gt;I keep sitting down and discreetly asking if she is ok, if she needs anything, and she just blankly stares at me and tells me everything is fine, and asks what I’m talking about.

That's really immature behavior. He should have been irritated at that point. Finally, I don't know where you see him repeatedly comforting her, ditching his friends at their party, not going downtown with them, and spending the entire night holding her as ""not a word of compassion"". "

So when you take your 32F and add an extender, you are not changing the cup volume at all.  You're just changing the band length.  No matter what you do to that band, your bra will always have a cup volume of 850cc.  So let's say that your extender adds two inches to the band.  You know that the stretched band length will now be roughly 34 inches, and the volume is still 850cc.  According to [this chart](http://i.imgur.com/6KJjw.png), that means your bra with an extender is effectively a 34E."

At the time we met, he had been single and not dating at all for nearly five years. He'd all but given up, and had therefore spent most of that five years working on improving himself and just generally doing things he enjoyed. Based on this, I wouldn't say you should just forget about women. More like maybe you should just put your focus on pursuing things you enjoy as much as possible, but make sure to do at least one small thing per week where you might meet people. Perhaps a professional organization, or some recreational group related to your hobbies? That way, you keep your toe in the water, so to speak, but mostly focus on yourself. "

After many launch issues with all their games I decided I was going to stop buying EA games after Mass Effect 3(since it was a single player game and I wanted to finish the series). When the new gen came out I thought I give EA a go again. I enjoy the games they publish but they consistently ruin the experience with their servers.

When I first loaded up BF4 I couldn't play for a few weeks then they updated some shit and I was able to get into some games. BF4 is my favorite shooter and I had been thinking about buying premium up until yesterday. I was able to play 3 matches yesterday. I got into a server after a 20 minute wait, played three matches and then the game crashed. I reloaded and saw queues above 70 people. I gave up. 

I really don't know why I thought things would be different this gen but I guess not. The only reason why I decided to give EA a chance again was because Titanfall looks like it's going to be a great game but I may just skip over that one and go back to my no EA game bandwagon. If the division lives up to the hype I will most definitely be skipping Titanfall."

OR be sent to jail and a dark elf will find you and give you a note and she says ""It's from a friend."" and the note will say to go where I told you.

Do so, and wait for orthodox rebels to appear, then allow them to win and accept their demand to switch your state religion to orthodox. You can then reform Byzantium. 

It keeps the Ottoman ideas and troop types. Westernizing gives you the western troops as per usual, but, you'll always keep the Ottoman ideas.

The idea of a guy even hugging me thats not him is digusting. I planned our wedding and couldnt wait to spend forever as his wife.

I wont regret not having sex with others. Because sex without love is pointless. He is all I want in a person.

Now I am moving to a city he was so exicted about moving to with me and talked about building a home together etc etc... im moving alone and I am trying to be happy but I am so damn depressed and lifeless.

Knowing he loves me and I was his best love and he regreted leaving me and I know he wants to get his life together before marrgie and thats awesome. But, i never expect "" I think I think want to date others before marrying because I cant do cretin things when married."" It is hard to qesution life when you trusted everything he said.

I find myself always wondering why I am not good enough. Am I not pretty enough? Even though he once I am the most beautiful and perfect for him. But I feel disgusting and not good enough. I sometimes wonder if our sex life wasnt good enough even though he loved it. I was willing any time of the day or night. I would do anything sexually for him or any fanatsy. But he stopped sex because his addiction. I know it isnt my fault for the break up.

But the person who told me he was going to marry me left and i lost all my confedence  and I feel worthless. I just wanted to please him and make him happy. I know I tried to hard but I just wanted to be his wife like he told me I would.

Im sorry I am going on... crying as I type. I cant stop thinking about it all and how unexpected and horrible it was. 

And now I cant stop thinking about him with other people and it feels like a kinfe to my heart and I feel so lifeless.

He wont give me back my real titaum diamond promise ring I gave him on his brithday, which he teared up for. And he has dozens of writings, stories  love letters, poems, etc etc from me he says he is to scared to read (tho he has read many) because he knows they are wonderful and he will feel quilty and mix feelings and be depressed. He keeps the Pokemon plush i made him on his bed or near it.

Everything I gave him he uses and refuses to give it away or toss it. I know our breakup isnt yours and much different.

I just feel bad for your girlfriend because I know the horrible pain. I am very depressed and I dont feel happy for anything. The best part of my world is gone.

I will stop sorry!

But, you love her but there areproblems. Try explaining the weight gain and sex life to her kindly as possible. And try new things together. Make life fun. And if you feel better stay. Or take a break and dont talk for two months and dont date and see how it feels. 

Whatever you do someone is going to be hurt badly.

Don't cheap out on the monitor- this one is WAAY better. Also razer has shitty quality control and I wouldn't buy anything from them. This is a similar keyboard with cherry MX red keys which are less noisy and better for gaming, IMO. Other than that- changed to an i3 with an appropriate motherboard. It is a solid improvement over the A10 or any other current FM2-socket CPU, thanks to having higher per-core performance. Picked a much better quality case. The corsair PSU is nothing fantastic but is sufficient for this build. An r9-270 is a good video card for this budget, good performance and very power-efficient for graphics. With this case you really shouldn't need any extra fans, either. "

Actual content is harder and harder to come by. It's because the simple stuff needs 1 second to upvote while the better, more in-depth material needs more time to decide if it's upvote-worthy or not. Therefor, more simple stuff on the frontpage. Not always a bad thing, but I feel it is here.

Public suicides are generally sure ways of dying when firearms aren't available, since those who want to end their lives do not want to chance not succeeding if pills/whatever do not work.

But this is because of the culture surrounding suicide. I mean hell, in feudal Japan people were *expected* to take their lives if they brought about any shame. There's nothing that states they would have to do it in front of people, and they could do it in a guaranteed painless fashion.

&gt;With the bipolar thing, I was referring more to the fact that bipolar people may not actually want to commit suicide unless they are in a state in which they are out of their mind, more or less, but if they are undiagnosed they can still technically understand the consequences and etc, but not really want to do it when they are not having one of their manic depressive episodes.

In this instance, you could adopt the strategy they have in Oregon, in which people are screened and request permission for euthanasia, and then they have to ask again 2 weeks later to demonstrate that they are determined and it is not a whim."

I got up, stand next to a door but bus just went by my bus stop. Luckily some grandma was getting off at the next stop so I looked exactly at what magic she was using to have the bus stop :) In Poland buses in my city stopped at each bus stop. I think British solution is better as what's the point for a bus to stop if nobody is there nor anybody goes out of a bus?


Water taps without mixer!!! God, this is the most illogical thing in UK, especially when ""extremely hot"", ""extremely cold"" options of water you have. You don't see it in Poland at all. I still don't understand why people buy, install and use those things. At my current place of living the first thing we did was to switch taps to the ones with mixer. However, a guy didn't change it in basin in the bathroom because of some ""technical problems"" (he wasn't Eastern European but Irish) and I have a pain every day when washing my hands or brushing teeth.


Impression of British people. Generally positive. I however remember a guy, a mechanic, who was originally from Cyprus (I think) who have lived here for many years (like 20 or 30) who told me at the very beginning of my stay in UK that I need to be careful with British people as they say nice things to you to your face but as soon as you turn your back they want to stab you. I haven't experienced anything like that myself but on many occasions felt that for British person being completely sympathetic is just a rarity. I think with Poles, more of them will tell you to your face they don't like you. British person will say something like ""he's ok"" while actually thinking ""I don't like him"". I'm not saying that all but only when compared with people from my country, meaning we are more straightforward with many things, while Brits try to be polite all the time."

Yeah, except the part where you and OP make it about the ex anyway.  None of what she said is about the ex!

&gt;can be taken (rightly so) as belittling, and it stings, however thick your skin is.

Because people have such a warped concept of money, income, economics, whatever.  It is *not* rightly so taken as belittling.  Some jobs make more money than others.  If you happen to have one of those jobs, then chances are your life is going to be different than someone that has a job that makes less than you.  *It's not a big deal.*  People that make it into a big deal are either insecure or have no concept on how things work.

He made millions, and it was relevant to the stories - plus, it's not too hard to figure out when the guy has a ginormous house, huge TVs in every room, luxury cars, whatever.  But who cares?  I don't.  My job doesn't make millions.  Big freakin deal.  It's just money, get over it."

The problem with feminism in the west today is that women assume any trend or choice is the result of oppression, rather than actually accepting that maybe if 80% of women choose to be mothers and housewives given completely free choice, this naturally would result in ""exceptional"" roles and careers being less populated by women simply by virtue of statistics.

Just suck it up, it's natural. Breathe the scent in and force yourself to develop an acquired taste. She's only young, she can't smell that bad from any infections or diseases quite yet.

Dragon Age 2 is kinda iffy yeah, but the writing team is the same so the story is still worth the play if you can stand how rushed the game generally is - just try not to actively compare it to Origins. Watch a few LPs or gameplay videos, avoid Reviews that came out upon launch as they will all be bitter with disappointment. The DLC are both really high quality so I'd recommend getting those to accompany the game if you do.

Mostly I recommend it because for all it's faults it is the perfect primer for the scenario that Dragon Age: Inquisition is set in, taking the themes from DA:O and expanding on them.

My SO and I didn't really like the term MILF, but I kind of stumbled on it after saying that she is so cute and adorable that it's so Milfy. Later for the blog I thought, 'Hot Milfy' but thought that would be for full nudes etc and more sexual, and just wanted to do more M than R rated type blog if that makes sense. And I like those Milfy woman that just 'Wow!' ;-p "
niramu,curlyhair,1388678273.0,"Ooooo whoa, sorry for such a late reply! But better late then never right?

I do my hair myself (with my mum's help) and I have been since I was 12 (however I haven't always been this colour). I use two different dyes to colour my hair, L'Oreal Hicolour Hilights for Dark Hair in RED and Manic Panic in Rock n Roll Red and Pillarbox Red. The L'oreal colour is a one step colour (bleaches while depositing colour) and I use this on my whole head once every 3 months to make sure my roots match my ends. I use the Manic Panic colours between the L'oreal colourings to keep my hair bright and even.

I also use a Davines Red Alchemic Conditioner to keep my hair bright. It's a pigmented conditioner and I find it works a lot better than putting a vegetable based dye (like Manic Panic) in your conditioner and using that. I also take VERY cold showers, avoid direct sunlight on my hair, no shampoo (I've been CG for almost 4 years now), no swimming or getting my hair wet aside from rain and my showers, minimal washing of my hair (I wash my hair like 2 times a week).

For maintaining my curls, minimal product. I found that with all the colouring I have been doing over the last 7 years my hair doesn't take well to styling products because of how porous it is. Instead, I use lots of moisturizing products as well as protein rich products. By keeping my curls so moisturized they clump together nicely with no frizz and I can go longer between washes.

Unfortunately, I'm not willing to give up my hair today. Come back next week!"

As an example, I enjoy taking care of horses. Do you realize what a minority a male is in the equestrian world? Women love watching men take care of things. It's not a free pass to getting all the ladies, it is a free pass to getting to know many of them in a comfortable setting.

dunnoyabassa,INTP,1388678621.0,"i grew up in a pretty basic midwest suburb... the kind that isn't really a suburb of any big city... just a lot of middle-class protestant white people who built up enough applebees and olive gardens to call their home as big a city as the neighboring slightly-more-urban-small-city nearby.  big enough place not to know everyone in my graduating class... small enough to bump into the people you'd rather not all the time.  currently i live in my college town of ann arbor, which is no new york, but it's got a city feel to it; i think of it as a tourist town above anything.

long story short, i don't really have experience living in a big city or a small town, but having traveled a reasonable amount here are my feels about the issue:

most large american cities i have visited are just plain terrible. they are dirty, they are loud, they are stressful, and the people have a tendency to be mean, but that's not really even their biggest problem.  for me, the issue of transportation is what makes cities impossible.  i cannot tolerate the sense of being trapped in such a single confined location.  in cities, the very basics of existence have you trapped.  want to eat?  you can either brave the elements and acquire whatever food is conveniently nearby within walking distance or you can enter the battle of public or private forms of transportation.  for how many ""options"" and for how much ""something is always happening"" in a city, I don't have the money or the patience to take advantage of much.

tourist towns are for tourists.  when you live there you live for the tourists.  is art fair going on in front of your office?  ahaha fuck you trying to get to work on time.  is it move-in season?  ahaha fuck you trying to use roads, these are impromptu parking lots now.  is a football game happening?  ahaha fuck you trying to get a seat at your regular bar.

i don't get the sense of blending in to a city anonymously in the way you describe... people still notice you in cities, but they are usually members of the local homeless population, or angry people seeking an easy target to scream at or flip off.  i also don't share your lack of interest in bush-walking and star-gazing.  mountains and lakes will always trump bridges and skyscrapers in my aesthetic opinion, but that's just different strokes for different folks.

generally my main beef with cities is that i find them to require a huge expenditure of time, money, and effort in order to make them livable, which kinda makes up for the additional level of potential fun and opportunity."

ANewMachine615,conspiratocracy,1388678642.0,"If it was engineered, then it's poorly engineered. It's more deadly than average for a flu strain, but hardly anything like the 1918 pandemic.

Flu shots are hugely effective at reducing the spread of the disease, and preventing its severity. They're a cheap, great public health tool.

Why would FEMA, the CDC, or WHO prepare and release a pandemic agent? I don't see anything that would suggest A.) such a cover-up is possible (since ""compartmentalization"" of this type of project would be nigh-impossible -- you'd need a few hundred genetic engineers/biologists who know they're actively engaged in creating a kick-ass pandemic bug) or B.) that it's happening, or C.) a motivation for any of the proposed agencies to do it.

H1N1 is a particularly debilitating version of the flu. Strains like that develop all the time, and are problematic when they do. H1N1 is, luckily, covered by this year's flu shot. If you want to avoid a few weeks of contagiousness and a few days of pretty awful sickness, the flu shot is your best chance short of total personal isolation."

VoxMeretricis,AskWomen,1388678960.0,"I think misogyny, like many of the issues society faces, has a lot of deeply complex factors. The internet gives men and women (because, let's not forget that women can propagate misogyny as well - you'd be surprised how many women hate other women) an anonymous platform to voice their beliefs, but I don't think there's any significant difference between internet misogyny and real-life misogyny besides the fact it's easier to denigrate women on the internet.

One thing to keep in mind is the term itself: misogyny is the hatred of women. That's a very strict definition to work within. Misogyny isn't the same thing as patriarchy which isn't the same thing as masculinity (despite the fact that all three concepts certainly help construct and influence the others). I don't think most men actually hate women, even on the internet. I think they have deeply held feelings of entitlement to women's attention and bodies, to the validation of masculinity through enforcement of traditional ideas about femininity, and an uneasy relationship with their own power and privilege. There is a real resistance to gender empathy that means, in many cases, men don't critically examine how or why they feel that way about women - they just do. This resistance comes, I believe, from the subconscious knowledge that they do have positions of power and privilege and no one wants to know what it feels like to be disempowered and to be denied privilege. Better to protect that, even at the disadvantage of women, and tell yourself that it's justified because women are inherently somehow lesser than men, in whatever way.

So, my point is that I don't think there's a lot of clear-cut misogyny. It's not just simply hatred, and even when it is about hatred, there's nothing simple about it. Women aren't hated because they have a vagina. It's not biology. Women are hated because they are understood to embody femininity, and femininity is understood as flawed, weak, and inherently and justly subject to male control. Whenever that narrative is challenged, as it must be, there is going to be a wide variety of responses. Many of the men who want to re-establish masculinity as as a power structure don't hate women - they just don't want femininity to be as valued and privileged as masculinity. 

So how is this to be prevented? Well, I think the best way to prevent it doesn't happen in the internet. After all, the internet is a reflection of society, not the other way around, and our understanding of gender is inherently a social construction. It has been and will continue to be a long, slow, and painful road toward establishing equality of genders not just in a legal sense but in a cultural and social sense.

I have one bow instead of spear just because I find it to give me a lot more utility. (spear also gives me mana issues)

I don't have any banisher priests in my own G/W just because of the restrictive mana base (my deck leans G, especially with Evlish Mystic) and usually your last breath/selesnya charms takes care of threats (MoW or Gods). I'd take out time to feed and throw in a couple plummets for their flyers (especially Stormbreath Dragon). I'd sideboard Soldier of Pantheon against BBoV too.

madhjsp,Tennesseetitans,1388678998.0,"If we do draft a QB early, it means we won't be keeping Locker. Think about it: suppose we do draft a QB in the 1st round and keep Locker around to start for a year, then he finally stays healthy all season and has a strong year, maybe leading the team to the playoffs. What do we do then? Do we really discard our successful QB for an unproven younger one which we already sank a first-round pick into?  

Mainly for this reason, I don't think we're going to go QB in the first. Locker is still young and inexpensive, so it doesn't make much financial sense to get rid of him, and there are other, more pressing holes on the team that could be filled with the 11th overall pick. However, I could easily see us picking a QB in the 2nd-4th round, depending on what's available, to serve as a young backup/insurance plan a la Kirk Cousins. "
azayii,Fantasy,1388679000.0,"**The Blade Itself** - Joe Abercrombie: I have owned all of this trilogy since it came out in paperback...and yet only just got to read it! How did that happen?! I don't know, but I'm full of regret now (even more, since I accidentally spoilt a major plot twist for myself in an /r/fantasy thread). I really liked the character of Jezal, and the way his point of view was so skewed according to his ridiculous pretension and his misplaced belief in himself. Wait, what am I talking about? Glokta was fabulous too, and I loved Ninefingers! OH - and West - despite...things! Jeez. I just really loved this book, and am getting onto the next two as soon as I clear space on my TBR pile. I'm so glad I finally got to this. Sure y'all have read it already.

**The Tiny Wife** - Andrew Kaufman: Sweet magical realism. I really loved Kaufman's *All My Friends Are Superheroes*, and this lived up to expectations. At a slim 88 pages, it took maybe two hours to get through, but I tried to savour it. I think Kaufman has a really lovely, soft style that is easy to digest and stupidly easy to read. Recommended.

**Throne of the Crescent Moon** - Saladin Ahmed: Finally! I've heard so many mixed reviews, I've been putting this off for ages! I actually loved it. Being half Arab, a lot of the culture was familiar and made me very sentimental about this book. Just by using an unusual setting, Ahmed managed to add a lot of dimensions to the books that other settings might not allow. While not religious, I thought the religion in this way interesting and well placed for the setting. Loved the end, and can't wait for the next book - I hear it might be out this year!

**A Christmas Carol** - Charles Dickens: This totally counts as fantasy, right?! Ghosts, for goodness sake! Anyway, I've read Great Expectations, which I love, but never got around to this. I thought it was seasonally appropriate. A well-worn story, but still felt fresh upon reading. I love Dickens style, so I expected to enjoy it.

**Vampires in the Lemon Grove** - Karen Russell: Not sure this collection of short stories was so much solely fantasy; it was mostly just all the stories included a speculative element. I liked all but three of the stories, but the ones I did like were incredible, especially the last two. Russell seems to like to have an element of creep in most of these, but one of my favourites was the slightly lighter ""The New Veterans"". Presidents reincarnated stable horses? Just brilliant - and surprisingly touching, too. Highly recommended.

**Love Minus Eighty** - Will McIntosh: It's sci-fi, but I'd like to include it, because I was kind of surprised by this one. I expected it to be fluffy and average, at best. I ended up loving it - the romance wasn't sickly sweet, and there was a lot of grief dealt with in those pages. I loved the way Mira tied in, as well as Lycan. I found Rob to be a little whining in the middle, but he ended up making up for it. Everyone in this book seemed unhappy, and there was a lot of bleakness to be found. Highly recommended."
sturdyliver,Christianity,1388679012.0,"The Catholic Church considers fasting to be one full meal plus two lighter meals not equaling up to a full meal. Typically meat is avoided, although fish may be eaten. This is not the only convention, but it is a good place to start. I can't speak for the Orthodox, but they are the heavy hitters of fasting in modern-day Christianity and I would definitely recommend reading into their fasting traditions if you are interested.

Wednesdays and Fridays are traditional days of fasting for Christians, particularly during Lent. However, fasting that is simply eating less food is not going to be spiritually enriching, so it is important that it is accompanied by added prayer, meditation, and/or works of mercy."

But hear me out. What we need for the next 5 years is Modi. Please let me explain why. During the next 5 years, I want AAP to build their base in several states, keep the pressure on NDA, and become a formidable opponent for the 2019/2020 general elections.

The risk now is, if AAP gets a few seats, which they might after the happenings in Delhi and the constant media attention they are getting, they'll fuck up NDA's chances, and we'll end up with either an unstable and/or a completely farcical and incompetent 3rd/4th front. And that will royally screw up India, especially considering the fuck up that happened with UPA2.

Most of Modi and BJP/NDA supporters are fully aware that NDA is neither corruption free nor super efficient, but they are the ones we need for the next 5 years, because for Modi there's a decent track record and a perceived or real image of him with the corporate world. AAP needs some time for evolving and learning. The growth must be organic.

EDIT: Let me clear my stand further. Someone asked me if I was voting in the Delhi 2013 elections, whether I will vote for AAP or BJP. I said, AAP for assembly and NDA for the centre. Why? Because even if AAP turns out to be a screwup, it's okay to screw it up in a state like Delhi where the damage won't be that big. It will be bad, but it won't be like a disaster that will take Delhi 25 years back. But India is too big to take that kind of a risk."

Reason-and-rhyme,summonerschool,1388679426.0,"Yeah, that's true. And his poke range isn't even that great. It's like half his kit (his W, ulti, and passive) is very on-tank-oriented, and the other half (Q, E, decent AD stats) is poke oriented. But his usefulness in both those roles is crippled by other parts of his kit. The fact that he's ranged means that he obtains no bonus MR per level which is really shitty late game for a tank. His ranged ability is impeded by his godawful attack range. Honestly I think one of the best roles for him is support, but I never see him played that way. He's got decent cc from his W and ult, and can poke enemies at a nice range with his Q to let his adc farm a little more freely. An unexpected ult is a guaranteed kill for his lane, especially if you can put your target under turret. And finally his E reduces armour, making it a lot easier to win damage trades.

I might buy him just to try it out."

KrisJade,AskReddit,1388679502.0,"I've had sleep paralysis since childhood but only came to understand it in the last few years. It had different manifestations when I was a child. Then, it was a small malevolent demon/goblin/drake like creature that tormented me frequently and promised me great things if only I'd say it's name 3 times. It promised to kill people I didn't like. It'd whine and shriek in agitation if I'd ignore it. Terrified me. As a teenager it became more classic SP; the inability to move, blink, scream. Just to stare in horror. It wasn't the little creature anymore, though, but spindly legged alien like things with huge eyes. They moved quickly. From the window, to right up in my unblinking face, then off to a dark corner. Still some inhuman shrieking. I'd also have dreams of these things visiting me in the future and being just as unable to stop them. Only a few times I've managed to snap out of the paralysis while still stuck in the hallucinations and have just screamed bloody murder. Once in a hotel room on vacation with my parents... gave them quite a fright. Other times, now as an adult, with my husband in bed. Most recently the creature has morphed into a giant stick bug like being. I have a deepseated fear of those. It scurries about the room, making this terrible clicking sound, skitters over the bed, goes up to my face...horrifying. I hate it so much.

There are simple bombs and there are complex bombs. In one of my first advanced IED courses, we were all given a one foot square plywood box with a lid on the first day of the course. We were told to design and build a bomb using any of the techniques that we already knew and those that we would learn on the course. There were no explosives used it in it obviously, just an electric buzzer that would sound if the device was ""detonated""

Over the weeks, everybody would work on their ""bomb"" during coffee breaks and at lunch time. I must have re-designed mine half a dozen times as I learnt about different types of anti-tamper methods and triggering devices. (I'm not going to get into the details for obvious reasons)

On the last day of the course, all 12 of us took our ""bombs"" into one of the workshops and armed them. We drew random numbers and were assigned somebody's ""bomb"" and were told to attempt and defuse it. All techniques were open to us including X-Ray, bomb disposal robots, and good old hands on in a bomb suit.

Every single one of us failed. In other words, every ""bomb"" detonated before it was made safe.

The point of the lesson was not lost on us. You will probably never overcome a talented bomb maker that is trying to do you, or other people harm.

It's just an ethnic or religious group can be painted as being different because of their identity, or can choose that identity as a banner for solidarity; when the root causes of the problems lie in the mundane issues that can affect Christian and Muslim peoples equally - poor levels of education, isolation, urban decay, ghettoization, unemployment, lack of role models, broken families, broken links to community, family and self, lack of social mobility, poorly planned urban areas, badly managed immigration policies etc etc. Them being Muslim is an easy blame, and an easy solution for the disadvantaged group. Taking to extreme idea of their self identity is as much a symptom as the turning to right wing politics, alcohol, drugs, crime as seen in disadvantaged groups of all colours and creeds.

I've always focused on relationships, but not necessarily romantic. Talk to a woman as a person, treat her well, if she finds you interesting maybe there's a possibility for something, or maybe not -  the focus on romance upfront can make it difficult to be relaxed and genuine.

Warning: I'm not a biologist, but this is what I have gleaned from The Internet.

The body pushes the warm blood to the outer layers of the skin to transfer the extra heat. This leads to a little more sweating, but the net result is a reduced temperature in slightly less time (that if you had drunk a cold drink, as the warm blood would be brought into the centre of your body to warm up the fluids before they could be digested).

It's a small change (in most folks) and is related to metabolic rate, from what I can tell."

For the second I would just invite him anyhow, but if that wasn't possible then a good compromise could maybe be text him sometimes during the party.

You're losing experience and gold by standing waiting around. Instead, tell your laner to let them push, use your lens to destroy a ward, leave and farm until the enemy laner is a good few steps past halfway in the lane. 

Another thing to address is why boots of mobility are so often a good choice for junglers: it's best if your enemy team SEES you somewhere else and assumes that it is safe to push. If you're speedy enough, you can, for example, enter mid-lane and then exit through the bot bush, path back behind your tower and head top. Enemies will ping ""careful bot"" and the top laner may see that as an opportunity to push. It can be hard to coordinate this stuff if you're not chatting with your teammates on Skype or vent or something, but that's how good teams operate. "

mmp31,politics,1388680640.0,"&gt;That's your opinion, but not everyone thinks so. 

It's not an opinion, it's a fact.  It doesn't say that anywhere in the Constitution. 

If you have a right to cheap healthcare, then I have the right to a cheap big screen TV, and I demand that you subsidize it for me.

&gt;I don't think you understand how expensive modern healthcare is. It's not something that charities can cover. 

I don't think you understand how basic economics works. That's why you focus on getting the costs down instead of socializing the costs onto taxpayers.  That doesn't bring the costs down, it just redistributes wealth and ignores the core of the problem.

&gt;Healthcare was cheap 50 years ago because it was awful. 

LOL. Healthcare was not awful 50 years ago.  The U.S. had the highest quality healthcare in the world at the time.

&gt;Healthcare costs have been going up globally. This isn't a phenomenon isolated to the United States. Better healthcare simply costs far more. 

Improvements in productivity drive costs downward.  That's why computers are better than they've ever been, and yet they are cheaper than ever.  There's not anything magic about healthcare that makes it any radically different or immune to the basic laws of supply and demand.

&gt;I will admit that I did not consider the sizeable population ascribing to the ""I want to die from disease"" view when I formed my opinions. It seems I must have overlooked them somehow... I wonder how that happened...

It doesn't matter how many people ascribe to that mentality.  It could be a million or it could be zero, because the fact is that you are depriving the individual of his freedom to choose that mentality.

&gt;To the degree that it affects them only. Car insurance is mandatory because when someone gets in a car accident the mandatory insurance makes sure both parties are covered financially so that nobody is left with a serious financial burden. Healthcare insurance is required because otherwise people with inadequate or no health insurance put a significant financial burden either onto taxpayers or onto others insured. 

The difference is that people who are driving have made the choice to.  They could choose to not drive, and they wouldn't be required to buy car insurance.  You can't compare that to health insurance, where you're saying that they should be required to purchase it just for being born on accident.  

&gt;Healthcare insurance is required because otherwise people with inadequate or no health insurance put a significant financial burden either onto taxpayers or onto others insured.

Putting a burden onto taxpayers is the price we pay for living in a free society that decides to have a welfare safety net.  As far as the burden being placed onto insurers, that's the price they pay for making the choice of having health insurance.  You don't have the right to cheap prices.

As I said, your solution doesn't actually bring the costs down.  It just redistributes wealth by socializing the losses entirely onto taxpayers, instead of a combination of taxpayers and insurance customers.

And that's not to mention that a lot of people cannot afford to be forced to buy health insurance, which completely invalidates your argument because you're contradicting yourself.

&gt;And no, charity cannot cover healthcare. If you look at the amount of GDP countries spend on healthcare then you'll realize just how expensive healthcare is. The charity idea is absurd.

It was working 50 years ago.  The poor and elderly were being admitted to hospitals at about the same rate they are today.  Health insurance actually functioned as insurance (it was only used to measure risk).  Healthcare costs were so cheap that doctors could afford to provide care to the poor for free, and most people could afford to pay for doctor visits and drugs entirely out of pocket.  Your claim that the charity idea is absurd is an ignorant view of how our country was half a century ago.

The only way to fix the healthcare system is LOW PRICES, and the most efficient way to do that is through free market competition."

I anticipated awkwardness as we had a fair amount of mutual friends, but when she told all of them ""they had to choose"" all of them did and they didn't choose her.  she was quite something.

second:  INTJ.  One of my best girl friends ever... she's far more introverted than I am, so we coexisted really comfortably.  We don't talk or see each other very often, but we still regularly snapchat each other videos of our cats.

third:  woof, challenging.  not positive about her type... probably INFJ?  we were friends prior to living together and still are, but i was wary from the start and really needed a roommate at the time.  all she ever wanted to do was binge-watch bad usa daytime dramas while talking over the show and showing me corresponding youtube videos.  we probably would have gotten along a lot better if she smoked more weed.  our friendship survived by my not being home very often."

callc92,AskReddit,1388680993.0,"I think most people would disagree with you on the food front. We have higher food standards in terms of what is allowed to go into food. I recently visited america for the first time in September and was extremely disappointed with the food, having eaten in 10 restaurants (was there for 10 days) I only found 2 that I would say were as good as what I would get in a similar standard place in the UK. There was a serious lack of vegetables (only about 3 of the places didn't charge extra for vegetables???)and in general the chicken wasn't as good quality (that may have just one particularly bad place but we avoided chicken after that). I think in the UK we have a much bigger attitude that all food should be as fresh as possible and only using the highest quality, *healthiest* ingredients (less fatty food etc). Although saying that ribs with proper American BBQ sauce (that I actually ate in the UK, but it is an American recipe) is one of the best things that I have ever eaten.
I would say the main thing is High Fructose Corn Syrup and some other additives not allowed in the UK affects the taste of food and drinks, all of your fizzy drinks are way too sweet.
Also, roast dinners, fish and chips and a lot of pies all come from the UK.

I don't know much about US higher education, but our education system in general is better. We outperformed the USA in maths, English and science in global tests and we have better controls on what is taught. Even religious schools in the UK are not allowed to teach that the creation theory is correct and that the big bang theory and evolution are wrong. And we don't have a problem with loads of books being banned etc. as seems to be happening in certain areas of America. 

I don't know much about politics but I think we're a bit more open about certain things, e.g we've always had loads of CCTV and the police can ask for phone records in certain situations, and the majority of the population was against invading Iraq from the start as far as I can remember.

But yes I think a lot of it has to do with rivalry and pride. Its a bit of a running joke and I think we just find many aspects of american culture weird. Also most of the America bashing is directed at the south/red necks etc (which you guys seem to do yourselves any way). 

TL,DR British food is better quality, our education system is better (don't really know about how college/university compare though) and America bashing is mostly aimed at red necks."

raziphel,AskReddit,1388681029.0,"This is one of those staples that everyone should know, because everyone needs a good red sauce recipe.  Feel free to tweak it, of course:

**Rustic Italian Red Sauce Pasta**

(note: use a deep, french-style sauce pan for this)

* olive oil
* 1 onion, minced
* 3-4 cloves garlic, chopped (add as much as you want)
* 1 carrot, sliced
* basil, oregano, thyme, 3 bay leaves, salt, pepper, crushed red pepper
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1 large can of peeled tomatoes (san marzano romas if you can find them), or 1 large can of crushed tomatoes.
* 1 can sardines, chopped
* 1 can of tomato paste
* 1 pinch of sugar
* ~ 1/2 box of your favorite pasta (I like penne)
* parmesan to taste

Cook the pasta as directed.  You'll want it a little on the al dente side.

Saute the onion, garlic, and carrot in the olive oil.  add salt, pepper, the green herbs, red pepper flakes, and the sardines.  when the onion is yellow, add the wine and simmer for a few minutes.  once most of the liquid is reduced, add the tomatoes.  If you go with the whole peeled tomatoes, mush them with a spoon (you'll get a better chunky texture that way).  The tomato paste will thicken it up, but feel free to add more diced tomatoes or whatever until you get the consistency you want.  Add the sugar and cinnamon, and simmer for 30-45 minutes.  The longer you simmer it, the smoother the texture will be.  

Add a few spoonfuls of the pasta water to the sauce, and either drain the pasta or scoop it directly into the pan (hence why you need the deep sauce pan).  Stir and let it simmer for ~ 5 minutes.  Pick out the bay leaves and serve with the parmesan.

notes:

The sugar mellows out the acidity of the tomatoes.

The anchovies give it a deeper, umami flavor.  If you're vegetarian, you can do this with a hearty splash of balsamic vinegar added toward the end.  

The cinnamon gives it a slightly curry flavor.

If you want more meat in it, you can use some beef, pancetta, and/or proscuitto.  You may need to pour off some of the grease.  Ground turkey works if you want a milder flavor.

**alternate vodka sauce version** (great for date night.  seriously): replace the red wine with vodka (Stoli-level vodka is best), and add a pint or so of heavy cream to the tomatoes.  Add more cheese and hot sauce to taste, but leave out the meat; use mushrooms, and serve with roasted chicken and veggies."

- a total of 5 cards in your deck of 60 that you can play turn 1 or 2.

- way too few land to support a deck that has 18 cards that cost 4 or more land.

You want to aim at a mana curve that's roughly even at each converted mana cost. Meaning that there are equally many cards that cost 1 as there are those that cost 2,3,4 and so on. And once you go above 4 cards that cost 5 or more, you want to start adding land.

Unfortunately many of Poles don't work here in industries directly related to their higher education... but this also changes, we just need time to settle.

I would seriously consider going back if I had a guaranteed income there or from here.

A loving relationship should *add* to your life. It shouldn't *be* your life.

My advice to you would be to strive to improve yourself and be the best man you can be. Whether you want to seek out male or female partners is up to you and your desires, but don't try to ""force"" your sexuality in a direction. From there, focus on finding the worthwhile people and cutting out the worthless people. You'll find happiness, it just won't come in the form that society told you to expect.

JJEagleHawk,AskReddit,1388681334.0,"Lived in London for a year. Some things I found unusual (as a midwestern American):

(1) It's been said already, but ""You alright?"" as a greeting is something I never really acclimated to.

(2) You don't say hello to strangers. Rare to even even acknowledge them. I thought that was just a big-city (London) thing, because I've definitely seen that in NYC, but that was true everywhere we went in England.
EDIT: Maybe just the few places we went; apparently Northern England (Yorkshire, instance?) is friendlier.

(3) The orderliness of escalators is awesome -- stand on the right, walk on the left -- yet for some reason sidewalks are a disorderly mess.

(4) ""Mate"" has a range of applications, from genuine friends to a sarcastic address to irritating strangers. (Of course, when you refer to that irritating stranger later to one of your mates, you might call him a ""bloke"" or a ""geezer"" to indicate that he wasn't a true mate.)

(5) Tube cars with no tourists on them are deathly quiet -- it's almost like Brits think eye-contact and conversation spreads disease. If you're on the Tube and talking, 8/10 chance you're a tourist, and 9.8/10 if you don't have headphones in.

(6) Charitable giving. It's tough to find people that don't have an automatic debit for a charity -- RSPCA, Bernardos, Cancer Research UK -- and tough to find a high street without a charity shop. I know Americans also give to charities but it seems much less compulsory. People (in Britain) often support charities solely due to a personal connection to the charity, whereas in the U.S. it's more (though not only) for tax reasons. (*H/T to /u/Alexinsfo)

(7) Pub culture -- people take their kids to pubs! Here, bars are lonely places where alcoholics and 20-somethings go to get hammered. There, pubs are merely socializing hubs. I rather like that, actually, and miss it back stateside.

(8) Panto.

(9) Just-barely-below-room-temperature ""real ales"". WTF, guys? EDIT: WOAH, Backlash unanticipated. Note I am not promoting traditional american-style lagers as a superior product.

**(10) Can't believe I forgot this one . . . but pull-string lights in the bathroom. Everywhere else in the house will have light switches, but the bathrooms in a lot of houses still have a pull-string light. (Don't get me started on split taps, either.)

GetOffMyLawn_,Fibromyalgia,1388681456.0,"Somewhere in my tons of Internet research over the years I have found stuff implicating the vagus nerve. Not sure that there is much that can be done for improving the health of it.

&gt; The Vagus Nerve Infection Hypothesis (VNIH) of CFS is as follows: While the sensory vagus nerve normally signals the body to rest when it senses a peripheral infection, that fatigue signal is pathologically exaggerated when an infection is located on the vagus nerve itself. More specifically: Immune cells, including neuroimmune cells called glial cells, sense infection and launch the same basic neuroexcitatory response
regardless of infection type. When the glial cells that envelop the sensitive vagus nerve are activated by any viral or bacterial infection, their neuroexcitatory secretions escalate afferent vagus nerve signaling, which is misinterpreted by the brain as evidence of a severe peripheral infection. The brain then initiates sickness behavior, which includes fatigue and many other CFS symptoms (see Key Terms Table). Because of the way that glial cell activation may persist in a pathological positive feedback loop (as it does in neuropathic pain conditions), these CFS symptoms can persist for many years.[...]

&gt; The study of phenomena – such as sickness behavior – that sit at the intersection of behavior, brain biology, and immunology, is a relatively new field of study known as psychoneuroimmunology [...]  To understand the VNIH, one must understand each part of the connection among behavior (‘‘psycho-’’), the nervous system (‘‘-neuro-’’) and the innate immune system (‘‘-immunology’’).

&gt; The VNIH offers CFS researchers and patients a specific mechanism for explaining symptoms, and it offers testable hypotheses and treatment strategies. According to this hypothesis, the major symptoms experienced by CFS patients represent pathologically exaggerated sickness behavior caused by infection-activated glial signaling somewhere along the afferent vagus nerve system. Several researchers have advanced theories that align with the VNIH of CFS. Many groups have pointed out that CFS symptoms are consistent with viral infection and ongoing immune activation. More specifically, Shapiro theorized that CFS could be caused by the common neurotropic herpes virus varicella-zoster infecting the peripheral nervous system [139]. Maes has pointed out the overlap between inflammation, depression, and CFS [140]. The vagus nerve hypothesis provides an exact mechanism to these hypotheses, as well as an explanation for many of the inconsistencies in the literature.[Med Hypotheses. 2013 Jun 18. Chronic fatigue syndrome from vagus nerve infection: A psychoneuroimmunological hypothesis. Vanelzakker MB.]

Some people get names mixed up and it's not a personal thing, it's just that they have a lot going on in their heads and it gets worse when you are drunk. 

Considering the fact this woman is still in his life, it sounds like an honest and understandable mistake. Think about it like this - the ex is basically a member of his family, even though they aren't in a relationship. So in a way, this is kind of similar to him accidentally calling you his mom's, sister's or other female relative's name. If I were you, I would try to think about it like that, and desexualize the connection to his ex, you know? 

You're allowed to be hurt over this, but I might sit down and consideration the fact that responding with a joke is definitely the best and least painful way of dealing with something like this. "

Use a few drops of olive oil to cleanse damp skin by rubbing in circles for about a minute. Rinse with warm water, then remove with a soft cotton pad or a micrfiber cloth. Don't scrub or strip with a harsh cleanser. Use a tiny drop of olive oil to moisturize, then follow up with sunscreen. Try that for a week and see if it changes your skin texture/water-loss issue. Twice a week use a AHA exfolliator to remove dead skin and smooth the surface of your face.

As far as makeup goes I'd suggest avoiding setting powders as they usually contain large amounts of silica which can cause flashback from cameras. Whatever you use make sure you take a photo in dim light with a flash, you don't want to look like a ghost. The Smashbox primer is notorious for this so avoid it like the plague."

Your husband hasn't changed in 30 years, he's probably not going to now.

My friend's children plead with her to kick him out. She cares so much about him, that she knows he'll die out there. Even her children say, hey we don't want dad to die but if he can't take care of himself, why should you break your back daily to do so?

My friend takes care of all of her family. She helps out her kids by babysitting grandkids when she's able. She also took her of her grandmother til she passed, and now her mom who is going through dementia.

It's too much. I wish she could get rid of that parasite, but she refuses.

PLEASE love yourself more. You are not ugly, nor unwanted. You've let yourself get broken but you can stop that. 

You don't need a companion, however please also remember he's not the only person you can spend the rest of your life with. I know it sounds daunting, but in the process of loving yourself, you might be surprised to see that there are other options out there.

I eventually bought a 2006 DL650 (Vstrom) and it's been a great bike both for city and highway. I wouldn't recommend a sport tourer unless your commute is very long and mostly highway.

Qinella,AskMen,1388681922.0,"If you are trying to decide whether or not to circumcise, I'd recommend reading scholarly articles on the topic. You can try different search terms [here](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=circumcision+health&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C34&amp;as_vis=1). The top study in my search states that the benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks:

&gt; There is substantial evidence that circumcision protects males from HIV infection, penile carcinoma, urinary tract infections, and ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases. We could find little scientific evidence of adverse effects on sexual, psychological, or emotional health. Surgical risks associated with circumcision, particularly bleeding, penile injury, and local infection, as well as the consequences of the pain experienced with neonatal circumcision, are valid concerns that require appropriate responses. 

This is in line with everything I've heard from doctors speaking about circumcision and other articles I've read online. 

In the end, nobody is going to agree, regardless of studies or data. Your best bet is to get as much info as possible. I'm personally circumcised and I'm quite fine with it.

yakovgolyadkin,AskReddit,1388681924.0,"I agree that Bush was terrible, but Reagan arguably laid the groundwork for all conservatives in US politics for the past 30 years. Any of the negative things they do can arguably have some of the blame put on Reagan. Neo-conservatism can trace itself back to him.

Also, Bush Jr. did more than any president before him to combat AIDS in Africa. Reagan INTENTIONALLY ignored AIDS in America for YEARS because it was believed at the time to only effect gay people (it was called GRID - Gay-Related Immune Deficiency). He ignored it early when a strong government response could've had a serious effect on curbing it. Because of his intentional inaction, AIDS BECAME a crisis. On top of all of the problems caused by the conservative movement, one can also place a good amount of blame on Reagan for the AIDS epidemic.

And don't get me started on Iran-Contra. Illegally selling weapons to Iran then given the money from the sales to death-squads in Central America? Oh, and let's not forget that the CIA, under orders from Reagan, was buying cocaine from the Contra rebels, and flying it to LA and selling it, fueling the crack epidemic.

So yeah, modern neo-conservatism, the AIDS epidemic, the crack epidemic, and a massive illegal weapons sale scandal. Bush was bad, but not that bad."

At the end of the day, it's still a game and you need to play how you are comfortable playing.  If you do something you're not comfortable doing, you will play worse than you would otherwise.  Find sometime to practice if you want to work on pet micromanagement.  During an AK run or some other silly easy fight.  Help FC members with content and just practice in there.

I haven't been able to visit my SO yet (legal things and my mom being ridiculous), but I hope to this summer.

First time I ever got to hold his hand, it still gives me butterflies when I think about it.

Was probably the single toughest decision I have made in my life. .

I liken it to having your fingertip cut off with a saw, its painful, it hurts for a long time and even when you have it sewn back on some of the feeling is lost.

That said, you can't let one bad experience rule your life though, you need to learn from what did and did not work and move on. Focus on you, finding what makes you happy and meet your needs."
JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388682232.0,"I'm for individual liberty too, but we cannot guarantee it for all as long as a small minority can exercise their will over the masses because we structure it where that's the only way they can maintain their sustenance. I also don't promote  violence against others, that's what the state is for. It is given the monopoly over violence, so in theory, we don't have to practice it upon each other. And even then, we have an mplicit threat of violence to keep the state in line in our constitution, in the form of the second amendment. 

The reason I'm not concerned about OUR state, aside from this NSA stuff, which I DO NOT approve of by the way, is because it has a pretty good track record of not being tyrannical. We can both say what we want and not have to worry about some government van coming to pick us up to send us to some ""re-education"" camp. We  can both vote. Etc.

But freedom DOES have limits. If you want a life with no limits, you want a life without the social contract and in a state of nature, and as Thomas Hobbes pointed out, such a life is nasty, brutish, and short.

So here's my logic. Our government has been set up to keep itself in check in many ways, we need to focus on the power businesses have to keep THEM in check. They wield A LOT of power over peoples' lives. Especially because we rely on them for our own sustenance. And unlike government, they're interested solely in profit, and will throw you and me under the bus to get it.

I suggest you rethink your priorities as far as business goes, and argue for limitations of their power, presumably like you argue for the limitations of the state. The state and business can both become corrupt, b ut in our society such as ours, I'd argue business is the greater threat."

I respond to you, because you could drop this in the suggestion box.  

1. Develop or market other PV products.  There are already enough eGo clones out there, this is cheap by now.  Buy rights to label one of them.  Market your own pre-filled cartos to attempt to keep your customer base.  Satisfy them, and they will likely stay.
2. Admit the restricted experience of the cigalike on a little card that comes in the box, ""Due to the nature of manufacturing techniques ... but, we offer these higher quality products..."" or something to the like.
3. Profit.

It seems simple to me, and unless Blu is only interested in it's profit margin for this pennies-on-the-dollar (now) contraption, they will eventually fail as the ""one trick pony"" always does, and take their legal department with them."

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1388682302.0,"I actually came here before 2004 (on student visa) and saw completely no discrimination towards me nor other Poles personally since.

Stereotyping, maybe a little but only in things like ""You are a Pole so you must drink vodka"" (I don't enjoy drinking alcohol but I know I'm in general an exception when compared to many citizens of different countries). 

There was once a situation where a (possibly) Indian guy wasn't happy that my mum took line in a queue to a till in a supermarket before I came with a trolley (matter of moments later). He said something ""maybe in your country you can save a place in a queue"" to which I replied ""in your country you don't even have supermarkets"" which pretty much shut him up. He was just an idiot though.

Yes, UK is a big deal as whole EU is. It gives a chance to people who struggle in Poland (obviously not all struggle there!) to go abroad to work, study and visit nice places. Not everybody has enough courage to go abroad and I know it by even looking at some of my friends who came here only to go back few months later. After all you leave all behind and go to a new country and start from a beginning.

I don't think Poles in general have much troubles adjusting. After all UK and whole Europe are very similar in plenty of things. The main adjustment may be with English language, as some may not know it at all while others need to polish it further and it's obviously very problematic if you can't communicate and have to rely on someone else to do translating. Driving on the other side for many is an issue (at the beginning) but after few months of driving you just get used to it."

goundo,CampingandHiking,1388682467.0,"So, I'm wondering what you are going to do with all this. Are you just into the outdoors? Are you planning on dirtbagging? I'd suggest splitting things up by the activities you will use them for. Ex:  
Front country camping gear (big tent, 2 burner stove, 6 of Magic Hat)  
Backcountry camping gear (UL tent, alcohol stove, Long Trail in cans)  
Alpinist gear (4 season tent, Jetboil, bourbon)  
Climbing gear (biners, draws, rope, PBR)

Then, as you practice that activity more, you can develop an idea of what skills and gear you would like to have (or ditch) to improve your wilderness experience. 

If you plan on spending time where there is non-potable water, I'd suggest getting a Sawyer filter. It's $30, lifetime guarantee, and no waiting or iodine taste. Another pretty general thing I didn't see was a stove. Fires are nice now and then, but they impact the environment, and are a pain in the ass to build when you just want to cook dinner and go to sleep. You can make an alcohol stove out of a cat food can, or better, out of two beer cans; but alcohol doesn't work as well when it gets cold - canister stoves or white gas works better.

Oh, and unless you plan on doing some survivalism, ditch the axe and saw as camping gear. If you find a use for them, that use probably isn't LNT."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388682471.0,"&gt; The drug dealers are mostly killing their competition and those that rat them out. They are not oppressing everyone for ideological reasons.

Who says the reasons have to be ideological? Don't they terrorize entire towns? I think I watched somewhere they force people by gun point to pick their crops for them.

&gt;Let's not forget, the drug dealers cant legally murder or oppress you.

Legal, illegal, it's all a matter of perspective. I look at the act, not the legality of the act. Legal by its very definition implies state sanctioned, so you're arguing a tautology here.

&gt;And you have already stated you are going to subjugate the working class, legally steal from them the fruits of their labor, for the poor

Actually, the working class of America has as much to benefit from my plans as the poor. Say you make $50,000 a year. Sure, at 40% tax you pay $20,000 in taxes, but if you recieve $15,000 in basic income TOO (since ALL adults get it), they only pay $5,000 in practice, or 10%. Which is probably less than someone in that situation does now, considering payroll taxes and then income taxes, etc. Middle class either remains the same or benefits because they recieve basic income too, which knocks a lot off of their tax bill alternatively.

I also love hardcore mode where stimpacks only regenerate health over time- no instant heal in the middle of a fight. Playing this way makes you feel like you are not some sort of mutant super-soldier, it seems very realistic, and it is very challenging.

So many people asked ""which Skateland"" I was talking about, so I made an edit saying it was the one in Omaha. A ton of people replied saying they're from Omaha and knew exactly which one I was talking about.

Well, one string of comments with /u/Lije93 started getting pretty personal for a public thread, so we moved it to a PM conversation. Ended up exchanging novel-long PMs getting to know each other, and friended each other on Facebook. Messaged on there almost every day, and eventually met up to get lunch. He's great. We're incredibly similar and have a ton in common. He's married and I have a boyfriend, so no dice in the romantic department.

IndependentBoof,AskReddit,1388682977.0,"I'm not really convinced he deserved it either, but there are so many misconceptions about why he won it. It wasn't for being the first black president, nor was it for anything related to the Iraq/Afghanistan wars. Here is the official explanation:

&gt; The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009 is to be awarded to President Barack Obama for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples. The Committee has attached special importance to Obama's vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons.
&gt;
&gt; Obama has as President created a new climate in international politics. Multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position, with emphasis on the role that the United Nations and other international institutions can play. Dialogue and negotiations are preferred as instruments for resolving even the most difficult international conflicts. The vision of a world free from nuclear arms has powerfully stimulated disarmament and arms control negotiations. Thanks to Obama's initiative, the USA is now playing a more constructive role in meeting the great climatic challenges the world is confronting. Democracy and human rights are to be strengthened.
&gt; 
&gt; Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world's attention and given its people hope for a better future. His diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world's population.
&gt; 
&gt; For 108 years, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has sought to stimulate precisely that international policy and those attitudes for which Obama is now the world's leading spokesman. The Committee endorses Obama's appeal that ""Now is the time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges.""

In short, he was recognized largely for reaching out to Egypt and other of our country's biggest rivals/critics with a humble, apologetic, and constructive vision. He was awarded for his words, not any actions as a President."

This is nonsense.  You can't seriously be claiming that people are taught not to commit murder and theft, but people *aren't* taught not to rape.  That's a truly mind-boggling proposition.

Furthermore, the actions of victims of crime are often questioned.  If a person is mugged, natural questions include ""were you drunk, why did you go down a dark alleyway, etc.""  The primary way we discourage most crimes is by focusing on the victim and what they can do to discourage victimization."

AnimusHerb240,DigitalCartel,1388683035.0,"My younger sister is bipolar and has had trouble keeping a job. I have my reservations about the implications of psychiatric pathology, even though in the evening hours I'm Googling my own mental hangups in an almost hypochondriacal fashion, and she really is a different person when she remembers her meds. Part of me resents that difficulty shifting burden onto my parents. Failure to launch, and all that. But in some cultures it's normal for the family to remain under one roof, amiright? Well, they are 1,800 miles away, and I have enough to worry about with ""my own family."" The non-existent one. The official divorce proceedings were finalized 31oct2012, but the unofficial proceedings...proceed. ""At least you didn't have children,"" is often offered as a consolation.

The main thing I am trying to reconcile these days is this: it seems very, very effortlessly obvious to my mother that there is plenty to live for and be excited about, and that my apocalyptic thinking is unwarranted and silly. She doesn't say ""silly"", but the way she kind of half rolls her eyes and smiles and asks me if I want anything from Starbucks makes me feel silly. I would like to know what switch to flip, what book to read, what Koolaid to drink to get me in on that mindset. She is brilliant and makes six figures in regulatory affairs. Something about her demeanor reminds me of Y.T.'s mom from *Snow Crash*. But something else about her ability to earn the respect of good people and persevere in the face of autoimmune diseases makes her one of the few in my life whose guidance I value.

I remember walking barefoot in the courtyard, and the way the grass felt growing in between uneven cobblestones. White pillars shone so brilliant in the afternoon sun, I would have to squint until I made my way past them into the shady inner cloister already bustling with friends and teachers. But I was born in Sacramento while Tom Brokaw mumbled on the set, something something Walter Mondale something something *Discovery* blah blah blah. Job opportunities brought us to the midwest, where Wendy's, Olive Garden, Best Buy, Wendy's, Olive Garden, Best Buy, Wendy's, Olive Garden, Best Buy. If you have a mind capable of sentimentalizing the trading of a $10 gift card with a logo printed on it for another $10 gift card with a different logo printed on it, I want to have little to do with you or your culture or the things you hold dear.

But this is the worst country, except for all the other ones. And this is the worst system, except for all the other ones. The deterministic cloud of my coming-of-age tale dissipates, and I find myself a moderately successful free-thinking individual in his prime.

Every day I am waiting for that big thing. Aliens landing on the white house lawn. North Korea putting their money where their mouth is. A coup d'état on Capitol Hill. Marissa Mayer declares war on Uruguay. Something. Anything. I refresh my browser tabs convinced ""today's the day."" I see neat TED videos about 3D printing new kidneys and nanobots that will clean our blood, and something about all that seems dubious and unrealistic. Not that we don't have the capability to forge such a future, but somehow I just don't see it happening.

I am missing something. My mindset is unsustainable. There is a certain desperation in my reaching out, there is a certain desperation in every new person encountered. *Maybe this person knows whatever it is I haven't figured out yet.* Nope. They are just as miserable and crazy as I am.

iDrogulus,gaming,1388683090.0,"As far as gameplay, I think 1.1 is more competitive and 1.0 is more chilled out about it.  In 1.0, a CTF match between two clans or groups of people on a private server is typically called a fun war (""fw"" for short), and in 1.1 it's called a ""scrim.""

Also, both versions often use a CTF map for public servers but specifically state to *not* capture the flag so that the server is killing only.  This is because there is not a ""death match"" mode in SWBF2, so we make do with what we have.  1.0 will definitely use this, while some 1.1 servers that I've seen use server mods, allowing conquest game mode with command post capturing disabled, or no flag spawning on CTF mode.

1.1 has some common, popular bot servers from SWGO (as you probably have seen), while some of the more well-known ""pros"" in 1.1 like to make fun of the ""jba players"" (Jedi Battle Arena server players) for playing against bots instead of humans (and generally being seen as ""nooby"").  Well, that actually has changed somewhat now, since the JBA server now only has 2 bots on each team.

1.0 does not have particularly popular servers, since the population is much smaller there.  Saber servers are pretty popular, just like in 1.1, but not almost constantly populated like in 1.1.  American 1.0 servers are *rarely* up, except for one American server that has been put up every Saturday (I mean *every* Saturday) for about the past six years (JS45 Saturday Night Firefight, ""SNFF"" for short).  However, European servers are pretty active every day, just not during the night hours for Americans (though they sometimes still are).  Turning on ""Search all regions"" under the online game options makes the place not look so dead."

dog_in_the_vent,AskReddit,1388683122.0,"I've experienced sleep paralysis twice, but both times didn't involve a ""demon.""

The first time I was sleeping on an air mattress after moving into a new place.  I couldn't move a muscle.  Nothing is restraining you, but your mind just can't make your body move, it's weird.  My eyes were open and there was motion near the door to my room.  It was opening, but it wasn't moving (also very weird).  My heart rate was racing, I was trying to scream.  I thought ""so this is what it's like to see a ghost"".  Eventually I willed myself awake, then lay there breathless for a while before going back to sleep with a light on.

The second time I was in another new apartment, but I had been living here longer than the first time.  I remember dreaming about walking around with a group of friends that I don't recognize.  I distinctly remember it was night time, there was a full moon, and we were walking down a dirt road.  As we're walking, I hear their voices growing louder and louder, as well as footsteps in gravel (crunch-crunch-crunch) getting louder.  They get so loud it wakes me up, but again I can't move a muscle.  The footsteps and voices keep getting louder, they sound like they're right outside my door.  This is when I realize what's happening to me.  ""It's sleep paralysis again.  There's no gravel outside my door and there's nobody there either.""  As soon as that thought went through my head I woke up fully.  It took a few minutes to calm down, and I went back to bed.

Now, neither of those occurrences involved a demon.  I've always been terrified of demons and the like.  Movies like the Exorcist and Paranormal Activity will fuck me up for weeks, and I avoid them as much as I can.  A few years ago I was consistently terrified of demons/ghosts.  I would imagine them standing at the foot of my bed as I slept, and I would open my eyes every few seconds to make sure nothing was there before I fell asleep.  I never saw anything, but the fear was enough to keep me from getting good sleep.  Then I had my first dream.  I think it's because he was in the movie ""Fallen"" (which involves demons and possession), but I was walking to work and Denzel Washington was walking towards me.  I was afraid at this for some reason.  He grinned and asked me my name.  Unsure of what he wanted, I told him my name.  Then he laughed and disappeared.  I woke up terrified, and continued to be scared for the next few nights.  I'm a religious person and so is my Mom.  I told her about it and she said she would pray for me.  Shortly after she prayed for me I had another dream.  This time my Mom, Denzel, and I were sitting at a table in a room.  Mom and Denzel were arguing about me.  She was telling Denzel that he has to leave me alone and that he couldn't touch me.  Denzel got mad and tried to punch me, but before he could make contact I heard a very loud clap of thunder and woke up.  I saw something dark sitting on top of me, then it jumped off and flew out the window.  At first I was terrified, my heart was racing and I was out of breath.  But in a matter of seconds I felt this calmness come over me.  I had just seen something horrifying, but I could have easily closed my eyes and fallen asleep.  I told my Mom about it and she was very happy to hear it.  I haven't had any problems since.  After this happened I looked up the wikipedia page on [sleep paralysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis).  I couldn't believe my eyes.  That painting and the statue are pretty much exactly what I saw."

so, i did mention that efficiency is a factor but i didn't focus on it, because all i was trying to say is that, essentially, you can make up for small displacement with higher revs.  but i do understand that at some rpm the efficiency starts to go down so much that you can't get any more power out of it.

Clearly you've never been robbed or had your car vandalized.  Generally the police will tell you what you can do differently in the future, and then tell you that there's nothing they can do.

&gt;If you go to a party with alcohol and drugs and get assaulted, the police may question your story. Your friends may wonder behind your back how much of it was your fault. The scenarios are very similar, but the fact that it was sexual makes all the difference.

This is true.  Rape and sexual assault are different than being mugged or robbed, because no one ever goes out and intentionally gets mugged and robbed.  That doesn't really happen.

However, people -- women -- do go out, do drink until their inhibitions fall away, and do engage in consensual sexual intercourse with complete strangers while drunk.  For fun.  And then someone of them lie about it!

So naturally, police have to ask questions.  Wouldn't want to send some guy to jail because some chick got hammered, decided to get laid, and only remember that she has a boyfriend in the morning (one of the leading causes of false accusations)."

goundo,backpacking,1388683532.0,"Now, I've never been on the Camino, and you aren't taking the famous route, but from what I have heard, 40L would be overkill.

From what I have heard, you don't have to camp, and you can stay in hostels every night. Since you don't have to camp, your load drops enormously. If I were to do this sort of hike, I would probably go with just a rain jacket, a fleece, a platy, and lunch. That could fit in a daypack (&lt;10L). However, this is an American perspective. Apparently, many Europeans make up the weight difference with changes of clothes, hygiene products, and other things that are too heavy and infrequently used to be justified on American trails. 

As for a pack, I'd say, get a 60L from Osprey, Granite Gear, or Gregory (those are good brands I know. There are probably other good brands across the pond. Deuter is one I know). 60L is enough for just about any expedition you may do. However, having a pack ""for life"" usually doesn't work out - as you get more into it, you specialize, and you'll want other packs with different functionalities."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1388683534.0,"I could also say that telling someone how to act as if I know best is also self-centered, but I think that's also spinning what was said in order to force a point.  

But anyway, the purpose of the story is to share a personal experience and how it affected me.  Basically, ""here is what I would base my advice off of, but I'm going to let you come to your own conclusions.""  

As an example, let's say you want to meet women, but you have no idea how.  You want to be able to approach someone you don't know, but it makes you nervous and freaks you out a little.  Here is how someone might give straight up advice:

""You just have to let go of your fears and dive right in.  It's really not as scary as you think.  They might not want to talk to you, but that's okay, just move on and try again.  It'll get easier over time, and you might be surprised at how easy it becomes.""

Seems like sound enough advice, and someone might listen, but they might not necessarily believe you from that.  Is that really true?  How do you know?  It seems like it makes sense, but does it really work like that?  But how about this:

""Yeah, I know what you mean.  It seems pretty tough at first, and when I started approaching women I was pretty damn nervous.  I gave it a shot anyway, and surprisingly, it wasn't bad at all.  I got shot down sometimes, but it didn't bother me like I thought it would.  I ended up having some pretty cool conversations and meeting some great people.  It didn't always pan out in the end, but at least I'm not afraid anymore...it's actually pretty easy now.""

This gets the same point across, but shows that there's actual experience behind it without directly telling the person what they should or shouldn't do.  All it says is ""this is what I did and this is how it worked out for me.""  I'd say it's far less self-centered.  I'm not pretending to be an expert, I'm just sharing what worked for me in case it could work for him.  I don't like telling people what they should do because only they know how they want to act or how they really feel.  

Also, like just about everything, this isn't the only solution.  If you don't have a story that applies, or if it's inappropriate to tell one, then don't.

dsklerm,nba,1388683538.0,"I love Paul George &amp; The Pacers, I genuinely think when it's all said and done he can go down as the greatest Pacer ever, can be a consistent top 5 player for years, and that they can win a championship this year etc...

But everything in OP's comment and your own is spot on.  The Pacers may be peaking right now, but Paul George still has room to improve.  He's a fantastic player, but when you're comparing everyone else to LeBron no one stacks up.  It's just not fair, and anyone who wants to pretend they stack up... doesn't.  Durant is a different type of player, and Chris Paul and LMA, and while I appreciate people putting George in  the conversation, and I think because of his defensive value he deserves to be there... but he's just close, he's not there yet. 

He's a star in the making, but this team wasn't built for him to carry the load like that at this point.  Our core stars like him, Hibbert and The 8th Grader all have elite talent, but their consistency is their biggest flaw, their inability to know exactly what you're going to get.  That's why they brought in veterans like West and Hill and later Scola.  I think the best way to put it is this.... they were built in a way that they really only need 4/7 guys to be ""on"" at any given time.  But they have 7 guys capable of 20 points, or 10 boards, or 8 assists.  And as long as 4 of them have good nights, I don't think anyone can beat us because this team has just that much talent.  And a lot of that is dependent on George being that elite, top 5 player... but if he's not hopefully 4 other guys pick up the slack.

mountainunicycler,photography,1388683635.0,"Science makes DSLRs safe. You can capture an image on an APS-C crop body camera through an 20mm lens that is focused from 5' in front of the camera to infinity, then turn around and take a picture that is in focused only between 3.5' and 5', with everything else blurred, with the same lens at the same focal length. 

You can even change the shape of sun stars in your image, because the number of points is twice the number of blades in the aperture. 

And thanks to diffraction, as you increase the number of pixels on tiny camera sensors, you will get blurry pictures until you increase the aperture size to decrease the size of the circle of confusion where the light hits the sensor. 

[This article shows](http://ryanzimmermanphotography.blogspot.com/2013/12/18-55mm-18mm-f22-15s-iso-100-this-is.html?m=1) (down at the end) that a Nikon D50, with only about six megapixels, shoots a sharper image at f/8 then a D7100, with about 24 megapixels, shoots at f/22 through the same lens. A D600 would shoot a sharper picture at f/16 then the D7100, because it has a bigger sensor and bigger pixels than the D7100, even though they have the same resolution. This means that if you make a tiny, 100mp sensor but put it behind too small of an aperture, diffraction limits the potential of that sensor to a laughable fraction of what a larger sensor and lens could do at the same resolution.  

I just picked these examples off the top of my head, without even going into the advantages of switching lenses and other things. "

How someone treats others when they're mildly upset is a glimpse into who they are.  This is how they will treat you when they're mad at you (and why it's important to be polite to servers).

a breakup feels like someone took a mellon baller to your heart and tore out chunks of your soul, and the stronger/better the relationship, the worse it's going to be.  You will heal and the pain will end eventually, but all your memories with that person will be bittersweet, if you're lucky.

**Everything takes effort**.  Relationships take constant maintenance, and complacency will challenge even the best of things.  If things hit the rocks, *take the steps necessary to fix it.*

The chemical love buzz wears off, usually after 18 months to 2 years.  Be ready for it, and have a strong enough relationship to push through it.  If things work really well, you'll never even notice.

How don't they have the ability to decide?  Are they incapacitated?

&gt;The problem here is that you have confused an idealized free market (where issues of inability to evaluate the good, to evaluate the benefit received from the good, and rational action is assumed by default) with a real market where there are information flaws, a lack of rationality, and the inability of the consumer to adequately understand and value the good persists. 

I've done absolutely no such thing.  I'm saying that market distortions are irrelevant to the point because the consumer has the freedom to choose. "

Oh, and she very nearly manages to fuck up several battles and almost the entire war for her side.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Dworkin#Intercourse
&gt;* In the book, she argues that all heterosexual sex in our patriarchal society is coercive and degrading to women, and sexual penetration 
may by its very nature doom women to inferiority and submission, and ""may be immune to reform"".[59]



#

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercourse_(book)

&gt; * the experience of heterosexual intercourse itself becomes a central part of men's subordination of women, experienced as a form of ""occupation""




#


&gt; * This is nihilism, or this is truth. He has to push in past boundaries. There is the outline of a body, distinct, separate, its integrity an illusion, a tragic deception, because unseen there is a slit between the legs, and he has to push into it. There is never a real privacy of the body that can coexist with intercourse: with being entered. The vagina itself is muscled and the muscles have to be pushed apart. The thrusting is persistent invasion. She is opened up, split down the center. She is occupied--physically, internally, in her privacy. ...



#



&gt; * Intercourse is a particular reality for women as an inferior class; and it has, in it, as part of it, violation of boundaries, taking over, occupation, destruction of privacy, all of which are construed to be normal and also fundamental to continuing human existence. 



#


&gt; * The political meaning of intercourse for women is the fundamental question of feminism and freedom: can an occupied people--physically occupied inside, internally invaded--be free; can those with a metaphysically compromised privacy have self-determination; can those without a biologically based physical integrity have self-respect?

JonWood007,changemyview,1388684031.0,"I suggest you read Ibn Khaldun's work. He lived during the 800s I believe? This was a time where the center of the world was the muslim world. He had this strange theory that because his people were brown skinned, they were the best, most civilized people for society. He considered both whites and blacks to be inferior races, because in his time, both Europe and Africa were pretty undeveloped at the time.

The point of bringing this up? Don't conflate race with societal success, it all varies on the time.

Here's a little secret you might not be aware of. But until right after WWII, the white European powers of the world controlled the world. They carved up Africa, enslaved blacks and often shipped them over here to America. South America, same thing. Native peoples were used for slave labor. Asia was also controlled a bit by the British, etc.

So after WWII, colonialism becomes too expensive, and in light of becoming more enlightened due to the holocaust, colonial powers cut their colonies loose. But wait, they were oppressed for hundreds of years, the boundaries are all arbitrarily put together so groups that hate each other end up in the same countries, the people learned brutality from the colonists (belgians used to cut off Africans' hands, for example, now Africans cut off other Africans' hands), etc.

What you're seeing today, is the aftermath of a highly racist (favoring whites) colonial world, and then you wonder why all the rich societies are white. Because they weren't oppressed for the last 5 centuries or so, for starters. 

Point is, it could've easily gone another way. If Muslims, for example, had conquered the world like Europeans did centuries later, people would still accept Ibn Khaldun's philosophy of brown skinned people being superior. Don't confuse race, skin color, with the real factors at work. They play a role, but nowhere near in the capacity you suggest. Being white doesn't automatically make you smarter or magically make you more apt to rule. However, being in a world that once gave whites privilege while oppressing and stunting the growth of everyone else does. Privilege does. Not having your country oppressed and ravaged does. Being educated does. Look at Barack Obama, president of the United States, leader of the free world. Agree or disagree with his politics all you want, but I'd argue he's as good as a president as anyone else. Better than some, worse than others. "

If someone looks like a slob, chances are they live like a slob.

sagradia,infj,1388684123.0,"I quit playing video games recently. You asked if your peer group is broken, and I think you have answered your own question. Men either have interests that improve them as a human being, or else they play games (as boys do) that improve no part in them whatsoever.

You are still in your forties and have no interest in spending your free time on activities that improve yourself or your relationships. Playing video games is a form of escape, a form of escape from the real world of work and relationship challenges, challenges that require active thinking and self-analyzing, and most certainly not **mindless** forms of escape. Your friends are developmentally retarded in the most correct definition of the word.

Hence, they fail at real life. Go find real interests for men, and there you will find like minded men, men who are not interested in actively retarding themselves (again, its correct definition). Go find men. Period. Not boys.

I don't think you should waste anymore time with your boy friends, because growth has to start on the inside, and you can't force it on people who simply are not ready to do what successful people do which is listening to other people's perspectives to continually improve their vantage point.

Or else, show them this and tell your boy friends you are ditching them because they are retarding themselves. Sometimes it takes being embarrassed and looking ridiculous, to break down the ego. And at this point, that might be the only hope for your Neverland boy friends.

I don't think you should force yourself into a relationship because you feel like this is the point in your life where you need to have one because others do. I have found that when you try to force it, you end up with someone who isn't really what you're looking for or settling for a mediocre relationship. Then you set yourself up for a break up from the get-go cause it's not what *you* really wanted. 

Maybe expanding your social circle would be a good option? Just for the purpose of meeting more people and making more significant connections.

Czar-Salesman,SubredditDrama,1388684319.0,"&gt;&gt;I don't see misogyny in western culture cutting down women.

&gt;I dunno, man. There's a lot of disparity between the sexes in business and in politics still. Like, a LOT. 

You may have missed my point, I was being literal when I said cutting down women as in killing them, a comment on the phrase ""misandry hurts feelings, misogyny kills""(or any version of that). 

Of course there are disparities. However women are not the only ones that get the short end of the stick in different aspects of life(for men we see disparities in the justice system, conviction rates and sentences). However neither sex is actually oppressed. 

Women aren't common as power figures in business? Women haven't been allowed to even work very long compared to men, society takes generations to change, we are just currently at a point where a female CEO is not viewed negatively by the majority of society. That will continue to change. Women also haven't been starting businesses nearly as long as men, women haven't been getting the same degrees as long as men and less women are getting those types of degrees even though more women are graduating, its social catch up taking place. You can't look at such disparity and claim oppression just because you don't see equal numbers.

Politics is much the same.

There is no systemic discrimination causing these disparities. "

3.  Pick up a copy of [Quiet](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307352145/ref=dp_proddesc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;n=283155)  

&gt;have a pretty hard time making friends and I think a lot of this is just because I'm not a really social person. I don't want to sound like a hermit, I have some good friends, I go out sometimes and I work in two primary schools, where I have to communicate with people on a regular basis and honestly do enjoy it.  

&gt; I only really knew one of the guys there and they all seemed like very outgoing people  

&gt;I had the opportunity to get 1 on 1 with most of them over the trip when it came to teaching them how to do the basics (Fire, cooking over fire, getting dry wood/clean water, basic safety, etc) where I got to know them all a bit between instructions so I didn't even see that comment coming.  

&gt;I am okay at normal conversation. Not great, but okay. I struggle in groups of people a bit still (keeping track of a bunch of people talking at once is hard for me)

&gt;if I'm not being talked to I only really add to a conversation when I have something to say

All of those quotes are classic hallmarks of introverts.

I would wager that when she said you were quiet it was her realizing something about you, not a judgement.  Before, she wasn't sure about you, you hadn't said much, so she only had an impression of what you looked like and who you were friends with.  Then you opened up a little and for her a light bulb went on.  You were with a group who was either already comfortable with each other or very out going.  Here you are, a new person, and you are different from the group, she was trying to figure out how does this guy fit in... he's different?  Then she ""sees you"" and she realizes, hey this guy is just like us, only quiet.

If you had some good rapport with her I bet you could ask her to introduce you to some of her friends.  Likely she would let the friend know ""quietdudeirl, is really cool, but he prefers talking in small groups or 1on1.""  
I can't tell you how many times at parties in college I tried to find a girl who would duck out to a fire escape or the roof, just so I could talk 1on1 with her.  I heard so many times ""I thought you were kind of weird, until we started talking alone""

Diffie-Hellman,HomeImprovement,1388684516.0,"Your plumber probably saw copper stub outs that were replacements or replaced copper going to the hot water tank and made some assumptions.  All of my plumbing is galvanized.  Will it have to be replaced?  Eventually.  Does it work right now?  Absolutely.

The picture that started this thread has been fixed.  I did it yesterday.  Turns out the only thing on that entire circuit was that light and the switch.  One breaker space taken up to run a single lightbulb.  The laundry room is adjacent to this workroom, so I went ahead and pulled wire over there and rewired the light there.  That was one of the wires going through the air return, so I made a baby step there.

This is in a basement workroom, so I don't care about exposed joists.  

I read up on how to make a simple coffered ceiling, and I've already planned to do this when the basement ceiling is redone.

Worse yet, there were 3 questions that seemed specifically designed to make me shell $40 for the next expansion.  Check out how they did this.

1. How likely are you to pay $39.99 for Warlords of Draenor without a character upgrade (to lvl 90)?

2. How likely are you to pay $**4**9.99 for Warlords of Draenor **with** a character upgrade (to lvl 90)?

3. How likely are you to pay $**3**9.99 for Warlords of Draenor **with** a character upgrade (to lvl 90)?

It is very disproportionate. Ironically enough, Mexican cartels (one in particular) helps fuel Chicago's murders. Chicago is one of the most important transit hubs for drugs going to the Northern United States and Canada. It is so crucial, the DEA nicknamed the Eisenhower Expressway the ""heroine highway. [One cartel controls most of the drug trade](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-17/heroin-pushed-on-chicago-by-cartel-fueling-gang-murders.html), but obviously other cartels and street gangs want their own slice of it. This fighting is what is behind most of Chicago's murders. 

This fighting is concentrated in a few neighborhoods. A University of Chicago Ph.D. student that studied murder trends in North America concluded that in Chicago's safe neighborhoods you're about as likely to get murdered as you are in Toronto. There is a huge disparity depending on the area. "

It was only possible to create in the first place based on previous creations (plastics, software, electronics, etc). If you say that these things are ok because they were licensed to do so you need to realized that not all of them were and that using a licensing system requires a regulating body. That regulating body is the government presiding over whichever country the action is taking place in. In the United States, that is the United States government.

turtlehana,AskWomen,1388684915.0,"&gt;How did your husband come to be so patient and understanding with you? And how did you communicate your issues with him? 

He was just a patient man. I saw how caring he was to his sister and mother. Then he treated my sisters well and animals well. It made me feel like he is good natured. 

I don't know what it was that caused him to be patient and understanding towards me except that he loved me enough to take the bad with the good and wanted to help me get through it/was willing to wait. 

He just wanted to tuck me into a little ball and hold me forever. (I'm 5'3"" and he is 5'11""). 

I told him about them around the time he said he loved me. I think also around this time his cat died and he was crying. He felt so comfortable with me. Not to mention he stood up for me when my sister was being an ass and when my dad was being a jerk. After that they respected him. 

He also didn't judge my situation with my mom. Never once did he make a rude comment. 

&gt;How did you come to trust him - was it a special event or just time? 

Time but evaluating things did help...

I did give him some trust over seven years but I didn't fully trust him until 3.5 years ago. I had been particularly jealous and mean which made him uncomfortable in our home. My libido had also faded away after being on the pill for so long. He was depressed because he felt like I didn't love him. :(

So I saw the doctor and switched birth control and decided it was time that I showed my husband how much he means to me to so worked on improving myself. (By reflecting, getting over jealousy, etc like I mentioned before). 

I talked to him about how I was feeling and he said that he may think another girl is attractive but that does not mean she is more attractive than me not to mention he loves who I am, that I'm the whole package. 

When I started improving he could tell and one day told me that he was proud of me and that he is happier now too. :) 

He learned to share his feeling more than he was.

It is interesting to write about because we have always communicated, laughed together, and enjoyed each other and it is hard to believe that we were able to enhance that by my simply trusting him like how he trusted me.

Me:  What?
Him: What do you have to say for yourself?

Me: Jim, I don't know what your talking about.

Him: My party.

Me: What?  Oh shit!  OMG, I'm so sorry Jim.  I completely forgot.  SO got called into the lab and I went with him.  We completely forgot.

Him:  &lt;Silence&gt;

Him: &lt;Silence&gt;

Me:  Uh, SO wants to apologize too, here he is.

My SO apologizes, they talk nicely for five minutes, I get the phone back, and return to the silent treatment.  We did end up meeting for drinks later that week but it was quite horrible as he spent the whole time ignoring me and talking to my SO only.  

I felt like complete shit for forgetting but I also don't understand why he handled it so immaturely.  It's not like there weren't other people there and it was an honest mistake.

**Alaskan Glazed Salmon**

1/3 c. butter
2/3 c. brown sugar
2 tsp  lemon juice
1 tsp white wine, serve the rest with dinner!

In a pan over **low** heat, (as not to burn the glaze) mix the above ingredients and melt them together, while constantly stirring. When the ingredients are fully melted and mixed, the glaze is done.

Place some aluminum foil around the salmon, spoon the glaze over the salmon and close it loosely. 
Heat your oven to 350 degrees and pop in the salmon.
You want to let it cook for about 8 to 10 minutes.

I usually serve it with some asparagus and stuffed crescent rolls. 

**Crescent Rolls recipe:** Lay out the crescent roll dough, place some shredded spinach and grated Parmesan cheese inside, roll up the dough as you normally would, gently brush the top of the roll with some olive oil and add a bit more grated Parmesan cheese. Bake as normal.)

I made this for my girlfriend for her birthday and she was amazed. The amount of work it actually took was about 15 minutes total, not counting the baking time. It's fast, easy, and delicious. "
sockalicious,personalfinance,1388685016.0,"22K a month is great.

The question is, how much of that money is for *you*?  How much of it are you going to keep for PersuasiveContrarian?

You should make a budget - rent, food, debt payoffs, car payment, insurance (car, health, etc) utilities and other recurring bills, etc.  Budget the max you can for retirement; if an IRA is all you have, consider a SEP/IRA or whatever else you're eligible for; get an idea of your taxes, that's part of the budget - and consider some of the money as mad money to buy a guitar or whatever.  Budget out a hefty e-fund; real estate is feast or famine and the famines can take years to end - you must know that.

There should be a *lot* left over.  How much of that is for you?  How much of it will you devote to the cause of making you, PersuasiveContrarian, a wealthy man?  Make that decision - it's your decision to make - but when you do, bear in mind that any money you *spend* is money that's *not for you* anymore.

Pay yourself by saving money - putting it away where you can't touch the capital and reinvest the income stream it makes.  You're working hard.  You deserve it.

2 things I'd especially consider in your place would be buying a starter condo instead of renting - for the equity-building (forced saving) and the mortgage tax break; and making darn sure that your health insurance is adequate.

No shit.  That doesn't disprove what I said.

&gt;This part especially baffles me:

Next time be more clear when you say things like ""healthcare was awful 50 years ago.""  You didn't indicate whether you were referring to it in absolute or relative terms.  I am not a mind reader.

&gt;Yes it was awful. That's why it cost so little. It was great 50 years ago for its time, but again we're not 50 years ago. We're today. To give you some very, very rough idea of how awful healthcare was back then, the first successful heart transplant was in 1967. These medical practices that seem common today did not exist 50 years ago. The medical field has been completely transformed in the past 50 years. It's nothing like it used to be, and that goes for price as well. 

Advancements in productivity and technology drive prices downward.  You are ignoring the basic laws of economics.  The most expensive healthcare is only the newest and best, which is typically what people want. The same was true in 1960.  There's nothing magical about today's most advanced technology that is causing healthcare to be extremely unaffordable for everybody.  In fact, advancements in technology and productivity should be driving the cost of healthcare downward overall for all but the best of the best, yet we are seeing the exact opposite.  It's clear that the high quality is not part of the cost problem.

&gt;To be honest you sound like someone who has no idea what they're talking about. You're just parroting Libertarian talking points (and rather poorly) with no understanding of just how expensive medicine has become as a result of the revolutionary improvements that medicine has brought us all. Healthcare isn't a tangible product like a computer. It's a service industry, and its costs go up as a result of its increasing complexity. It's getting more expensive globally because we can do things like heart transplants now. If that doesn't come across then I can't make it any clearer than that. 

Absolutely false. The term ""healthcare' encompasses both goods and services. 

To be honest you sound like someone who has no idea what they're talking about. You're just parroting left-wing statist talking points (and rather poorly) with no understanding of just how basic economics works, and hasn't changed since 1960."

Two notes, though:

* Freya bands tend to be on the stretchy side, iirc.  So if/when you decide to try other bras, I'd start on the 34E.
* Why not just give the 34E a try?  There's several websites with free shipping and returns (ASOS, Nordstrom, Amazon but only for Prime Eligible items and if you've got Amazon Prime).  Extenders only cost a buck or two.  Just buy a new bra in both sizes and some extenders, and see which you find more comfortable. Then return the other one."

This is a topic that has been debated countless times and I feel like both sides are talking past each other. It's inexcusable that people do this, but it's not like the rapist isn't condemned for the crime - people *loathe* rapists and there have been cases where rapists have had their teeth kicked in for such a crime. There have also been cases where people doubt the accuser, but I feel this stems from an ""innocent until proven guilty"" mentality.

The problem is that, as you've already stated, we give a disproportionate amount of blame to rape victims as opposed to any other crime. People throw justifications such as clothing and alcohol at women, but on the flip side many people don't even *believe* that men can get raped.

However, I think that people that make these claims of ""preventing rape""  aren't always claiming that *all me* are rapists to be guarded against, but rather that people should prevent rape against *rapists*. Of course, the problem is that many people don't understand the boundaries of consent and that is why we have a problem with drunk sex in the States.

I do lots of slow cooker stuff and then portion it into the jars. There are recipes galore for that. But my favorite trick is actually to bake things right in the jars. After Thanksgiving I made a turkey noodle casserole and baked it right in the jars. Last week I used them for meatloaf. I've also done apple crisps and pies in them for dessert. I usually leave a few in the fridge and put a bunch in the freezer. That way I have a variety of options and don't have to eat the same thing for a week.
  
I also try to find sides that can be made in bulk. For winter, it's been a lot of squash. I'll roast a couple of acorn or butternut squash and then portion it out.

To sum it all up, Guan Yu was a competent and talented general as well as a great fighter with some fatal personality flaws and a lack of diplomatic ability or foresight. He was acknowledged as such by his contemporaries and even the historians who compiled his biography.

In popular Chinese folklore, however, his exploits were magnified by about a thousand. He killed numerous generals in battle (with the Guan Dao, no less; a weapon attributed to him that was invented centuries after his death), struck fear into all he met, and was capable of superhuman feats of strength. His ghost even came back to kill Lü Meng, the general who defeated him and had him executed (never mind that Lü himself was deathly ill during the whole campaign anyway). The folklore version became the basis of people's understanding of Guan Yu, and now, Chinese restaurants have statues of a bearded guy who brought ruin to his lord by being arrogant and alienating his allies."

I have literally no idea of where I would meet anyone else, if ever I wanted anyone else. I work in a maternity setting. I'm alternating between my mum's house and my dad's house, having had to leave the home I shared with my partner. My friends live all over the country.


 At the moment, although I'm feeling desperately alone, heartbroken and pretty hopeless, I still have this feeling that I won't be alone forever.

I can tell you straight up that my friend's dobe/mastiff mix is the boss - she's not violent or agressive, but she enters the house first and leaves the house first. She governs play fighting, she keeps the other dogs from chasing the horses. I don't fully understand what's going on, but it's blatantly obvious that *she's in charge,* the other dogs obey her and defer to her. So I really don't know what people are coming out against when they say that dominance and pack theory is crap, because I see dogs *doing it to each other.*

It was ok, he was just chilling, being like a cute little kid. However, next thing I know he's grabbing for my breasts with one hand and trying to rip my jeans open with the other, and I'm terrified, and I'm struggling underneath him.

I felt myself trying to scream. I was suddenly back in my bed. No goblin or anything on me, throat still tense and gasps escaping. I thought I was awake, but I couldn't move; still struggling beneath the goblin. I felt like I was bound, and as much as I was trying to kick with one leg, it wasn't happening.

I managed to wake up properly. My heart was beating fast and my breath was so shaky. I knew I could move now but I didn't feel like I wanted to for a minute. I started crying.

Once I kind of settled myself, I tried to call my boyfriend but it was the middle of the night and he was fast asleep. So instead I watched videos of cute kittens until I felt safe enough to go back to sleep.

Esoteric_Indulgence,TwoXChromosomes,1388685362.0,"I have a friend who put herself through college and now graduate school via dancing. She has done bikini bars, strip clubs, nightclubs, and casinos and can make a few hundred or almost a thousand per night. So in terms of your first questions, yes it is possible to maintain school and strip at the same time. The money is actually really good, but it is dependent on where you work (you make more at a bikini bar than at a nightclub, you make more at a strip club than at a bikini bar). 

For rules, my friend has said it depends on the venue. It ranges from rules about attire to rules about interaction with guests. You could probably find a place that has rules you feel comfortable with. 

As far as safety, I couldn't really say because I've never talked with my friend on that topic. She has mentioned that if you get involved with strip clubs that you should always stay away from the drug scene that accompanies it. According to her, it's easier to make money and stay out of trouble at strip clubs if you're drug-free.

Another thing to consider that I don't think you mentioned is that these jobs are about manipulation. My friend strongly advised that if you go into this field, you need to be okay with tricking people into believing that you're interested in them. Making people believe that you're attracted to them or that they're attractive and fooling them into spending more money is what makes you money. She has emphasized that the entire thing is just a complete act. 

So in a nutshell, according to my friend, if you're smart about it you'll make off like a bandit. I know she did have a serious relationship with a guy for a long time and it was while she held these types of jobs, so I think it's possible to date if you find a guy who is understanding of what these jobs require.

I apologize that I can't give first hand information, but I hope some of this has helped. I'll be really honest here with my own opinion...I think that when necessity requires it, these jobs are something to seriously consider and they do make good money. So if you think this is what you need to do in order to get from point A to point B, then consider it carefully. It is a valid option."

Yeah, there's no such course of action in NY.  If you can't do the job, you can be fired, even if the reason you can't do the job is because of your comp claim.  We get it all the time - the employers will generally wait about 3 or 4 months and then send a letter saying, ""we have _____ job available, with these work requirements.  If you do not report to work on _____ date (like 7 days out), you will be considered to have abandoned your job.""  Then they fire them.

Like he said, it is seen by the average person as a medical process, which means that they could avoid receiving medical follow-up procedures after receiving the ultrasound.  I'm not saying it's an airtight argument, it's certainly not.  But I think it does have some merit.  I don't imagine that most of these centers tell their clientele not to get further medical treatment, so I don't think it's really that big of a deal from a medical standpoint.  I think the problem lies in the fact that we have no way of knowing whether or not they present these ultrasounds as medical procedures because they don't have to be inspected or regulated, really.

Also, I think it's about providing people with options and scientifically valid information.  Clinics that provide (or provided) abortion are watched like hawks to ensure that they aren't presenting abortion as the only option, and that they make sure people have access to resources for a multitude of abortion alternatives.

silverionmox,TrueAskReddit,1388685483.0,"&gt;From what I understand it seems like geothermal, hydroelectric, and wind are too diffuse and spread out to grow in a significant manner.

Why would that be a problem? Consumption is spread out too. You have to think outside of the box of centralized power generation. A solar panel on every roof, trade the excesses, and then see what gap remains to be filled with traditional big central plants.

Solar energy is within reach of families, wind is within reach of small businesses. That makes their potential adoption rates much, much bigger than those of the centralized plant of your choice.

&gt;With that in mind it seems like it may be a better plan to focus our efforts on adapting to the changes that are to come in stead of fighting the inevitable will become irreversible.

Adapting to the changes, oddly, overlaps with trying to prevent them for a great part: reducing resource consumption, increasing efficiency and letting the population dwindle are useful in both situations.

Get rid of the black and white thinking. Climate change is not a yes or no thing. It can be anything on a scale from manageable to apocalyptic. Any effort to prevent or catch greenhouse gases will push the needle back a bit towards manageable.

Tip: reducing the amount of industrial meat in your diet is the easiest way to do something to reduce greenhouse gases (methane, in this case, 40 times as bad as carbon dioxide), and it's completely under your control."

ebonlance,Warmachine,1388685572.0,"Re: the conclusions you've drawn about the factions:

1) Cygnar - yeah, this is actually pretty spot-on. Their main on-paper strength is shooting but they're really the swiss army knife of factions, and they're above-average in pretty much everything but rarely the best which causes a lot of unnecessary whining on the internet. They're one of the most competitive factions because of their general above-averageness. 

2) Menoth - Fire AoEs are nice but shooting is not why you take Menoth. They're a faction designed around becoming greater than the sum of its parts thanks to numerous and potent buffs and support. Their shooting overall might be the worst in Warmachine.

3) Scyrah - I'd classify them as being the ""tricksy"" faction more than being a shooty one. Granted they do have a lot of shooty tricks (Mage Hunters, oh god) but their main strength is the ability to defy opponents' assumptions by fucking up with their movement and spellcasting.

4) Legion has a reputation for being easy for beginners, but that really only applies to other beginners. Low point games are determined almost exclusively by threat range and who gets the first hit in, and Legion will almost always do that thanks to their ability to ignore almost all hindering effects. As you scale up in points and players get savvy about using tarpits the same tactics don't work, and a lot of newbies get frustrated by that. They're the ultimate glass cannon faction.

5) I can't say much about Skorne because I rarely play against them and don't play them myself, so my opinion is worthless there.

As for the actual questions:

1) This isn't 40k, you don't need to shell out $130 bucks on rulebooks before you can play the game. Each faction comes with quickstart rules that are enough to play the game in their ""battlebox"" which is basically a starter pack at 50 bucks. This has like a 10-12 point army in it, equivalent to about 500 points in 40k. I'd get that first. Once you need an actual you need a the Mk2 Prime book for Warmachine or Mk2 Primal for Hordes. Colossals and Wrath are expansions for Warmachine and Wrath and Gargantuans are expansions for Hordes. There are also Forces of: Faction Name books that are like 40k codices but not necessary for actual playing. Each model comes with a stat card that tells you everything you need to know about playing them, so the books are there to see what those stats are ahead of time and get fluff about the various factions. Most unit descriptions are available online and give you a rough idea of how they play, so the books aren't 100% necessary for a new player but still recommended. Basic unit descriptions for each faction can be found here: http://battlecollege.wikispaces.com/

2) They can be played as separate factions, but you can also add them to existing armies. Certain specific units only work for specific factions though. You can see who works for what at the BattleCollege site, which I heavily recommend: http://battlecollege.wikispaces.com/. 

3) Paint them however you want. There are rules for converting models and kitbashing for official tournaments but I wouldn't worry about that for now.

4) This shouldn't be difficult if you can contact them directly, most PGs I know are extremely enthusiastic about teaching newbies the game.

5) By far the best wargaming community I have ever been a part of. People actually care about playing the game and not just endless bitching about which faction got the latest release like in 40k and WHFB. The game is actually fun and so it draws good players, so the community is strong and continually growing as games like 40k hemorrhage players."

Canuck147,changemyview,1388685612.0,"I hope that's not what you got from my comment because that's not what I meant at all.

In his book *Why the West Rules for Now*, Ian Morris goes to pains to argue that 'The West' was historically in a stronger position that the east (ie. Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome were historically more developed than contemporary Chinese or Indian societies). He argues that it was only with the decline of Rome to war, famine, and disease that the East finally pulled ahead historically.

It is not at all the case that 'white people' invented conquering others. What is the case is that at the time where sufficient human knowledge had been accumulated for an industrial revolution to take place, England - which was one of a small number of societies geographically positioned to take advantage of such a revolution - was incentivized to industrialize to compensate for their relative lack of wealth and power, while China - which was already very wealthy and powerful - had no incentive to alter the status quo.

The rise of western europe is as much a quirk of timing as it was of geography. Had Rome maintained it's strength into the first millennium, it is very possible - if not probable - that Asian societies would had industrialized to better trade with Rome and the world would look very different than it currently does."

Would it be offensive if there was an article, ""Are you more blessed than Paul?"" and taking the same points?

Pretty simple. Don't over-think dates. As a society, we're trained by popular media to think a date involves something overly ubiquitous - movies, meals, etc. And for me, I'd still incorporate a meal. But unless you're just looking for a movie/sex/meal buddy, get out there and do something you both enjoy.

* I have seen the WordAds program, but it seems that Wordpress is already displaying ads on my content (sometimes I see placeholders that say, ""Occasionally, some of your readers may see an advertisement here."") and I don't want to add more.  If I went with WordAds would the ads I'm currently seeing be replaced or added to?
* I understand the conceptual difference between .com and .org, but I still don't really understand how my experience would change.  How would I write a post?  How would I check my stats?  How would I approve comments?  At the moment I do all of these things through the Wordpress dashboard; would I continue to do so?
* When I read about guided transfers it says, ""For those who would prefer the DIY route, we have a full guide on making the move to WordPress.org.""  When I click that link it says, ""If you are moving to a self-hosted blog using the WordPress.org software, you first need to obtain appropriate web hosting and have your WordPress.org blog/site up and running before transferring your content.The content transfer process is similar to that described above (between WordPress.com blogs):  In the old blog, go to Tools → Export and download the XML (WXR) file to your computer.  In the new blog, go to Tools → Import → WordPress and upload the file you downloaded in step 1. Make sure that you choose the option to Download &amp; import file attachments. This option will be available after you upload the file.""  Is that actually the ""full guide""?

lalit008,Texans,1388685710.0,"Once again you're falling into that same trap most NFL fans fall into these days. There are no sure c things in the NFL, let alone in the draft. You say we shouldn't waste a pick on a QB in the first few rounds unless it's a sure thing, but how can you say that about a QB and not every other position? 

What makes Jake Matthews a sure thing while teddy is a risk? 

You also say that the first few rounds involve guys that are riskier than those in the later rounds. It doesn't make sense v to me that you'd think a guy in the 5th or 6th would be a safer choice than a guy in the first two, three, rounds.

As far as those guys you mentioned, we don't know what they can do either. Kirk has like a 5 game sample size, and his stats aren't all that great. Mallet's played in two games, both of them in garbage time. 

Lastly, like I said before, we'd spend more on signing a FA or trading for a QB than we'd be able to. Why would we spend more on guys that are unknown when we can draft a guy, who is basically the same in terms of what we know about them, at a fraction of the cost?

In the first case they're practically invisible to the market, not in the latter case. Countries that experience capitalist growth often do so by shifting non-market production into the market. For example, women who previously did non-market housekeeping entering the job market  in the 20th century in the West.

&gt;Furthermore, the scale of the internal migration is a result of the demographic trends. A disproportional proportion of the migrants are in the 15-59yo range.

Obviously. The thing is that the fluctuation in China's labor supply is caused by a slowing migration to the cities, rather than demographic trends. The magnitude of the first effect is much larger than that of the second."

The last straw was our one year anniversary.  We decided to go out to eat to a place over an hour away.  He chose this up scale restaurant, which really impressed me because he barely showed interest in doing anything for me.  We eat our meal and enjoy ourselves until the bill came.

As I said, tax all forms of income equally. That would automatically include the huge income from property and rents these people would have without the anti-mechanization effects.

Canuck147,changemyview,1388686099.0,"I think it comes down to both geography and incentives. For starters, the Pacific is a much larger and more dangerous ocean than the Atlantic - it was always going to be easier to make an Atlantic journey than a Pacific one. With that in mind, you're going to need a damn good reason to make the trip. The Americas had plenty of silver and lots of land, but if the world is coming to trade with you and you already have incredible productive agriculture you don't have a strong incentive to go through the effort of colonization and exploitation. Consider that it took several hundred years for European colonies to develop into strong societies.

Europeans on the other hand had a big economic incentive to trade with Asia - they had fantastic luxury goods - but you had very little that they wanted and it was difficult to get there. This incentivized you to travel to the Americas and around Africa, and to establish colonies to provide gold and silver that Asian markets wanted.

You have to keep in mind that from the Asian perspective there was very little reason to go the Americas. In hindsight we can see it as a great opportunity for expansion, but the modern world has a much more progressive mindset given how rapidly we've seen the world change."

I learned on a heavy, and relatively small ninja 500, and I'm glad I did because I dropped it the first day. If you've never ridden and get a sport bike that comes close to fitting you size wise, you are going to be scared shitless by the power those things have.

I'm kinda biased because I have it's smaller cousin the z750, but you sit upright on it unless you want to lean forward, because it has handlebars, not the ridiculous clip ons that make you feel like you're dragging your knuckles on the front tire. 

Edit: Even though the z1000/750 aren't fully faired, regular people don't know about that. Most people think I have a crotch rocket, even though I can ride very comfortably for long periods (Chicago to Niagara Falls and back, for example).

And I have used it on reddit before, so it can work, although I agree, it doesn't always.  Like I said, I only tend to use stories when I can, but I never said it was the only way.

I mean really, people should be careful with any method of advice, so I think it's kind of silly to single out one post. What makes stories more objectionable than any other method of advice?  Leading questions are good as well, but I could just as easily say to be careful with that because if you aren't, you can lead people to your own conclusions instead of allowing them to reach their own.

Probably the best course of action is to give the answer about it being personal and say maybe we can discuss it at a later date. If he keeps on it, suggest a different topic that you are comfortable discussing. As others have said, debating will go nowhere. Eventually he'll have to find out about where you stand, but hopefully if you and your boyfriend are still together, that will come out at a time when your relationship is stronger and you're both willing to stand by one another even if his dad throws a fit.

hopewings,infj,1388686235.0,"&gt;Just about everyone I know has fairly big relationship issues. 

Your peers are affecting the way you view the world.  There are lots of good relationships out there, but you aren't seeing them.  The video gaming is not a cause, but a symptom.  My husband and I are both gamers, and we met while playing World of Warcraft (which we don't play anymore, but we continued for a while after we got together).  

Over the almost 5 years we've been together, we've seen lots of different gaming groups, lots of different interpersonal dynamics, and seen gaming buddies come and go.  The couples (both gaming and non-gaming) that we do befriend tend to be low-drama, harmonious and in generally healthy relationships.  The gaming community can be somewhat immature (generalizing of course) and self-reinforcing with regard to unhealthy relationships.

&gt;What ARE communication skills, really? To me it seems to be a way to tell the other person something they don't want to hear, without makin them feel you are 'rolling your eyes at them'. But it also seems to require that the other person has enough self esteem to be able to hear about a flaw of theirs, and not get defensive.

Yep, communication is a two-way street.  It requires two emotionally stable, mature and self-aware adults who are able to see and understand both their own and others' flaws, who strive for improving themselves, who are in control of their own emotions and actions, and who genuinely care about each other.  

&gt;Is this just the way the world works? I have dealt with this with my wife and it has helped (to understand resentment caused by 'rolling your eyes' but honestly if I did not read articles and try to learn... she has no interest in it. No one really seems to have an interest in improving themselves, they just chalk up a failed friendship or relationship to some factor, usually the other person, and think things will be better in the future.

Nope, it's not the way the world works if you choose differently.  I'm not saying this lightly because I used to think the same way as you.  I thought that truly healthy relationships were a pipe dream, and that all relationships were doomed to crappiness, not happiness.  That is, until I met my husband.  It's not so much that individually we would be great partners for anybody out there, but rather that together we mesh extremely well. 

We INFJs are often idealistic and perfectionistic about relationships.  This is not a bad thing.  It just means that we need to have higher standards about them, and not settle for something less.  Regarding your wife, perhaps you can start by finding out what Myers Briggs type she is, try to figure her out more deeply, and approach her perspective with more empathy and understanding.  Depending on her type, she is probably not going to seek this sort of thing out on her own, but you can certainly discuss it with her, which may spark her interest.

Whenever I feel a bit down about other people/the world/etc. I try to remember that we are all interconnected, and that our own actions reverberate out to the rest of the world.  If I can change my own attitude, if I can be more positive, loving and kind to others, and if I can try to help others and reach out to others, then I'm helping to change the overall negativity about relationships and love.  Hopefully I have made you a little bit less pessimistic... if not, I've typed a wall again. :P"

Russian_Surrender,news,1388686371.0,"I'm a bit outside of the typical Reddit demographic: 45 year old male.

I don't ""hate"" the unemployed, but in most cases^+, I don't have a *ton* of sympathy for the long-term unemployed.  I come from a background of being generally poor.  I was the first generation in my family to go to college, and I paid for it on my own by working through school.  My wife is an immigrant whose family came to America 40 years ago with nothing but the clothes on their back.  From my perspective, if *I* could ""make it"", and if my wife's family could ""make it"", then the opportunity is there for most people to ""make it"".

The different perspective I take from you is that I don't just look at the hear and now.  Yes, someone has been out of work for 9 months, is struggling to pay the mortgage on their $200,000 house and is already down to one car because the other one got repossessed.  I have empathy for that person's current situation, but in most cases, the person is in that situation because of choices they have made over a period of years or decades.

Why didn't they stock money away when they did have a job?  Why did they have 2 $20,000 car loans?  Why did they have 3 kids?  What makes them unemployable?  Did they make poor education/career choices?  What choices have they made in the past that makes other individuals more appealing as job candidates?

I've lost 3 jobs in my life.  2 because the company moved (I could have moved with them, but chose not to) and one because it was a dying industry and went out of business.  One job loss was the end of 2001 (right after 9/11).  Another was early 2009 (during the high point of the recession).  I was able to get a new job in less than 3 months every time.  I'm nothing special - certainly not from a special background - so why are some people unable to get a job - any job - for 2 years?  Because of my life experiences, my conclusion is that in most cases, it is because of *them*.  There is something about *them* - their past choices, their current choices, or (most likely) both - that is preventing them from getting a job.

Granted, the *reasons* for their current situation don't really change their current situation.  And I'm certainly not in favor of letting people die in the streets.  But government assistance should be set up to be a *worse* option than getting a job - *any* job.  And too often, that is not the case.  Too often, a person's finances &amp; life balance is better by staying on government assistance than it is to take a job they hate.

And I don't even blame the individual for that.  The problem isn't with individuals who honestly take the government assistance that is available.  If the government wants to give you money - for anything - you should *always* take it, 100% of the time.  The problem is with the system.

You can argue 2 sides of that coin.  You can argue the ""conservative"" side and say that government benefits should be reduced.  Or, you can argue the liberal side and push for a ""living wage"" tha would make getting a job better than staying on public assistance.  But you've got to recognize that there is a problem (and that problem manifests itself with, as you put it, ""Reddit hating the unemployed) when people *choose* to stay on the government dole because it is better for their life than taking a menial job.

^+ I say ""most cases"" to recognized individual circumstances of medical issues, etc.

Hence, ""fuzzy.""  When two women can leave their homes, engage in the exact same set of actions with the exact same set of men, with absolutely no difference between the encounters *except in how they are perceived by the woman*, and one woman can claim to have had a great time and the other can claim to have been raped, then yes, what constitutes rape is certainly less clear than what constitutes robbery or murder."

Overall though, I agree with you.  The thing about MacArthur is that he became a political football, not unlike George McClellan nearly 100 years earlier.  He became the darling and de facto leader of the Midwestern populists, who were decidedly opposed to the Truman administration.  MacArthur's ego, of course fed this phenomenon.

the fact you cant understand the difference between insulting someone as a means of invalidating their argument and as a legit comment observation to inform why the conversation is terminated.

&gt; 
&gt; you do realise the public transport in brussels is worse than most of the big cities in western eu, go to London,Paris and see their public transport and then compare it with belgian

I wouldn't call London and Paris ""most of the big cities"". Sure, public transport needs improvement, whatever you do.

Funding public transport is already under pressure because some lines aren't profitable if you look at it in a strictly commercial way. The best way to improve public transport is to make sure they have a broader customer base.

&gt;then there are poor people who use small cars/motorcycles/scooters. why should they pay more in fuel when already fuel is really expensive.

If they live in the city they can walk or bicycle. If they don't live in the city and can afford a car and the daily commute, they're not really poor, and it's a tax-deductible cost anyway.

&gt;may be the govt should improve the public transport first before punishing people for using private transport.

And round and round we go again. People just really, really like their cars because they're a little bit of private territory they can take along with them. They won't stop using them too much until we make sure the price of using a car adequately reflects its costs in economic dependency, environmental degradation, spatial planning, traffic deaths, noise, and a host of other factors."

Putting more money in the hands of charitable organizations doesn't guarantee that they will do more good. Sometimes there aren't enough volunteers or other factors to make things happen even when there's enough money.

As an example, consider a clothing drive. You collect clothing and give it out to people. You can get clothes by spreading the word about the drive. In an environment like a church, you will probably find a ton of people of all shapes and sizes willing to donate their old lightly used clothing. Then you get some volunteers to collect the clothing, wash it, sort it, and give it out to those in need. None of this requires much of a budget at all, and it probably isn't going to be reflected in the books.

I'm not saying that churches aren't spending too much on salaries, just that it's improper to draw conclusions about charitable efforts by churches based on this data alone."

I suppose this might sound like backtracking from my original comment, but I think it's also probably safe to assume that Belichick's coaching abilities had improved greatly since his time at the helm in Cleveland, enabling him to be better prepared to deal with the loss of his star QB for the season. As a younger, less seasoned coach without a well-established system and hand-picked personnel in place, he might not have fared so well.  

Very seldomly do young first-time head coaches find sustained success without the QB of their choice, and I think that's what happened to Belichick in Cleveland (that, and the team getting torpedoed by news of Modell's plans to move the team). "

Conquestador,badlinguistics,1388687034.0,"The deleted response, for posterity: (from the linked badlinguist)

&gt;Hello friend, I am that Critico-Jargonian you're talking about.

&gt;What I meant to comment on was not linguistic descriptivism in general, but the rhetorical and ideological basis that informs (and, I feel, undermines) the common liberal concept of ""tolerance,"" which basis seems to be embraced by the overwhelming of majority of linguists, especially those wishing to comment and advise on usage1. However, I take it as axiomatic that the question of how any one individual ought to speak and write is not, ultimately, a scientific one, and thus not a linguistic one, since no amount of empirical observation can ever tell you how things ""ought"" to be. It is, however, an important question, I think, since we all have to answer it, if not for others (and probably not), then at least for ourselves.

&gt;I take no issue with ""couching observations of difference,"" but rather with the attempt, through rhetoric, to subsume that difference onto our notion of what is normal or status-quo, rather than to accept it outright, as a thing in and of itself. Through this subsuming, otherness is robbed of everything which makes it other -- that is, the parts of it considered bad are discarded, relegated to some worse, not yet accepted form of otherness, while the parts of it found appealing are used by those doing the subsuming towards their own ends. Almost always this coincides with, and is tied up in, an invitation for those who accept the rhetoric pat themselves on the back for their tolerance and openmindedness, and in this way the worst of these arguments can be read as a mere grab at social and cultural capital on behalf of the arguer.

&gt;The clearest example of this rhetoric in action I can give would be this video. The message here essentially being, surprise, that couple you thought was heterosexual? Nope, they're gay! That's Right Folks, They're Just Like Us! Which is all fine and dandy, except when they're not just like us. I don't imagine this ad being all that successful if it was set in a leather bar, or if one of the characters was transgendered, or if the couple actually met on Grindr.

&gt;Anyways, that's just my opinion, or some of it at least, hopefully rendered in a less heavy handed, smug, or critico-jorgonian manner. I understand you folks disagree, strongly. It seems your sidebar is telling me to ""just leave and never come back."" Yet the same paragraph makes use of the dangerously ideological-sounding ""bigot,"" which is telling, I'd say.

 &gt;   These particular usage-commentators are commonly called ""descriptivists,"" though it seems like in this context the term is often defined solely in opposition to ""prescriptivists,"" and in this way the term is not exactly equivalent to how ""descriptivism"" is used outside of its relation to prescriptivism. Anyways, I'm using the term in the former sense."

Jrodicon,skiing,1388687313.0,"As a reference I've skied Loveland, A-basin, Keystone, Breck, Vail, Beaver Creek, Steamboat, Winterpark, Copper, Telluride, Durango, Wolf Creek, Taos, Santa Fe, Jackson Hole, Grand Targhee, Big Sky, and Bridger Bowl (and some other smaller insignificant places). Haven't skied Utah, but I've heard good things about Alta and Snowbird, and less good things about the other mountains.

Summit County does have full sized mountains though, Breck has the highest altitude lift in north america, and A-basin has the highest altitude inbounds terrain on the east wall (hike to). The geography of the area is such that a lot of the mountains aren't as steep as other mountains in the US, but there are certainly steep big mountain areas like East Wall at a-basin, Lake chutes at Breck, etc. below is a list of reasons why I prefer other places over summit county:

* All of Denver and their mother is there every weekend and so it gets REALLY crowded.
* Overpriced for what you get IMO (unless you have an epic pass)
* Every vail owned mountain (everything on the epic pass) has lots of employees on the mountain pulling passes for a variety of reasons from going too fast to smoking pot discretely in the trees. To be fair, it is against their policy to do these things, but I've never had this problem anywhere else. I've had several friends lose season passes at Breck and Keystone already this year.
* typically less snow than other places (especially Keystone, avoid it if you can, they hardly see any snow even compared to the rest of Summit County, it surprises me that anyone goes there)

I know this is probably more info than you really want but here is a little bit about weather in CO:

There are 2 main weather events which are most common and most predictable for colorado snow. Northwest flow is where the wind blows in from the northwest and it tends to fair pretty well for Summit County (this is what happened yesterday). Steamboat, Winter Park, Vail, and sometimes Breck seem to do best in this kind of wind. The other one is upslope flow, where the wind blows from the plains up the front range to the continental divide. Places along the divide do best here, and Denver and the front range cities typically see some snow. West of the divide usually doesn't do as well. Apart from this sometimes we get storm systems from the southwest which deliver for the San Juan's in southern Colorado. This also works out well for Crested Butte and Aspen. If the storm isn't looking like one of the above, it's pretty unpredictable and anything can happen."

Canuck147,changemyview,1388687325.0,"Uh no. For a few reasons.

First, human race isn't a real thing biologically speaking. Skin tone and facial profiles are misleading - there is more genetic diversity within 'races' than between 'races'. This essentially means that an average white male is more alike an average asian male than with a tall/short/fat/thin white male. Given sufficient time and geographic separation humans could very well evolve into different races, but this hasn't happened. Human beings, in large numbers, are essentially all the same.

Second, you also need to consider that Caucasians are only recently dominant. From about 700 CE to 1700 CE Asians were the dominant societies. Before that various societies of the Mediterranean were far more prosperous and powerful than their cousins on the fringes of Europe. I'd be very surprised if Caucasians continued to be as dominant and influential for another 200 years - in fact you could argue we've already turned that corner. The fact that people are now very actively breeding across ethnic lines suggests that the entire notion of race will be relegated to history sooner than later.

Finally - and related to my second point - there's little reason to suppose that the geography of Western Europe destined its peoples for anything in particular. Western Europeans did not spread like an unstoppabe tide across the whole of Eurasia and Africa. They were simply in a position to take advantage of fortuitous geography and *timing*. If China had been less wealthy, or the Mediterranean more wealthy Western Europe may not have bothered with the Americas at all. If China had avoided plague and invasion in the first millennium they may have industrialized before Europe and we would be living in an Asian hegemony.

Western Europe was in a position where they could industrialize, but it is an accident of history that they did. It could as easily have been the Romans or the Chinese had history run a slightly different course. "

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388687411.0,"&gt;This is a slippery slope. How careful do I have to be before I'm sufficiently relieved of blame?

It's not a slippery slope, this argument is just ridiculous sophistry.

Why do people gather in large crowds, imbibe copious amounts of alcohol, and combine that with dancing and music? Short answer: To get laid. The bacchanalia is as ancient as mankind, and as long as we have had fermented grains, we have combined them with music and dance to get people in the mood to fuck.

What this conversation is really about is woman who go to bacchanals and drink like participants, but then delude themselves into thinking that the entire point of the exercise is something other than encouraging drunken sex. And consequently get hurt. This is problematic because most of the women at such gatherings are actually there to get laid, which does in fact create a general air of consent and permissiveness.

Your argument would only make sense if we assume that you're essentially a very stupid person completely lacking in even a modicum of common sense. A work-related event where alcohol is being served is not a bacchanal, no one is expected to get drunk (and getting drunk at such events is widely considered déclassé). You very well know the difference, and to pretend that you don't is to present yourself as so mentally enfeebled that you might as well insist that others take control of your life away from you, since you're clearly not capable of handling adult responsibility.

I highly doubt the point of this argument is to convince us that you're an idiot who can't tell the difference between a frat party and a work function, so perhaps you should avoid arguments that hinge on us making those sorts of assumptions about you."

Since AHA makes your skin photosensitive, it's best to apply it at night, whereas you can get away with a BHA/VitC in the morning.

GreenGemsOmally,AskReddit,1388687526.0,"Maybe I can just shed some light on why it's important to me and why I follow college football with the intensity that I do.

My whole family is comprised of Notre Dame fans. Both of my parents went to ND/St. Mary's, as well as my two older siblings, and a bunch of aunts, uncles, and cousins. Since I was a child, we grew up watching Notre Dame football on saturdays with my family. It was less about the team and more about the activity that I commonly shared with my family.

A few years ago, I moved to New Orleans to live near my siblings. We make it a tradition that every saturday, my two brothers and I (and my sister, if she wants. She's not as big into football) get together and watch the ND game. 

In July of 2012, my Dad died. It was the hardest period of my life, but one of the things that kept me distracted was that on every saturday during the football season, my brothers and I would get together and watch football. Having ND go through an undefeated regular season and having at least one day a week where I could find something to celebrate helped me deal with the grief. It made me feel like my Dad was still here, because of how passionate he was about his alma mater. It helped bring my family closer together during a time where we all needed it.

Rooting for ND football and following the sport with such intensity is just another way that I remember and appreciate my Dad, and the legacy he created with a family that are so close as friends. It's a common shared activity between the people most important in my life.

I can understand that sports aren't for everybody. My girlfriend could not care less about football, but she understands that it's important to me and makes compromises where she can so that I can enjoy one of my favorite activities surrounded by the people I care about most. "

Menoth in a nutshell. 

EDIT: I should clarify.

Menoth has some of the most potent defensive buffs in the game, especially on their warjacks. Using a Choir of Menoth strips options away from opponents and two of them makes them functionally immune to damage and effects at range. The Choir is so important that it's practically auto-include and all of their jacks need to have the choir in mind when considering their stats. On top of that the Vassal makes it pretty easy to avoid retaliation too, so you can smack a crusader into something and walk away on their turn when they counterattack - most of the time anyway.

The same holds for religion.  It's not that religion makes people kill people.  Its that people who wish to kill get drawn to religion because it gives them the rationality they require to justify their actions.  They can kill in the name of God without feeling guilty about killing.

atrain728,civ,1388687695.0,"Go through the various civilization options. There are many that have war-based bonuses. Additionally, almost any leader's bonuses can be used to win a conquest victory. Any scientific or economic bonus can provide you better units or purchase more units, respectively.

As a general rule in civilization, you want to compound your bonuses. This applies to almost every aspect of the game, but especially to leader selection in a head-to-head. For instance, if you pick Ghengis Khan, he comes with the following bonus:

&gt;Mongol Terror
Combat Strength +30% when fighting City-State units or attacking a City-State itself. All mounted units have +1 Movement.

If you pick Ghengis, you should probably have it in your plans to pick on some City-States to acquire power/resources. You should also have it in your plans that you're going to rely heavily on mounted units. It takes some experience to know the best ways to do such things, but this needs to be your mindset.

In the case of Ghengis, Mongols are also given two Unique Units - an improved great general and the Keshik, which is a really powerful replacement for the Knight. You'll want to make the fullest of the era that the Keshik dominates.

A recommendation: Aztecs and Montezuma

It's hard to overlook Montezuma for a small world / head to head match. He starts with his unique unit and can begin pumping them out from Turn 0. This is one of my favorite civs in the early game conquest phase, but you *have* to make the most of this phase because Monte's utility fades rapidly. This is an ""all-in"" early game assault.

&gt;Sacrificial Captives
Gains 5 Culture for the empire from each enemy unit killed.

Seems simple enough, but making a small army of Jaguars and pounding the barbarian hordes into submission early will allow you to rush through the Honor tree (and upgrade your Jaguars). Your Jaguars already get a compounding bonus by healing 25HP per kill - a perk they keep when upgraded. So building yourself a massive army of Jaguars in the early term is a really powerful strategy. Also, they get bonuses to fighting in forests and jungles. Protip: compound on those with rough terrain bonuses and try to direct your fights to the forests and jungles.

On the other hand, you'll eventually get out-teched by a smart opponent, but that probably won't be your concern. If you don't have a significant point lead by the time you are upgrading past swordsmen, you're probably in for a rough game."

Just because animals do it doesn't make it void of societal expectation. Animals gnaw on peyote plants for the hallucinogen effects. Dolphins eat puffer fish for the hallucinogenic effects.

silverionmox,Economics,1388687742.0,"Yeah, it's a problem. Someone I know would like to start doing independently what he now does in employment. The thing is, he needs an Autocad license that costs several thousands of euros per year. He just can't slide into that gradually, he has to go all the way or he'll never be able to recoup costs of that magnitude. There's very little the government could do to change that; at present the tax system would let him deduct the losses of his side job from his main income, so they're pretty lenient already. There's always a risk involved, that's the thing with operating independently. It's possible to isolate yourself somewhat from the consequences of a failure by setting up separate businesses, but then you practically need to start a new one and play double or nothing to have any hopes to catch up with your debt."

There is no other motivation for you than fear. Fear losing all those days you worked on. At the beginning, 7 days are an achievement and you say ""Ha!, I can do this!"", then 21 days become an achievement and so on...
Once you reached 90 days, you will think two or three times before you actually do it.

Why fear? Because you know how it feels like when you stop! Do you want to lose control to this thing inside you? Do you want to feel anxious about not keeping it up? Don't!

1) Ensure that you have high enough skill to persuade a guard to 'look the other way'.  Amulet of Dibella and other enchants can help with this.  Alternatively, you could bribe the guards if you have the cash and perk.

2) Give yourself a small bounty.  For example, get caught picking a guard's pockets.

3) Persuade the guard to look the other way.  The successful persuasion will increase your speech skill.

4) Run around to other guards and talk to them.  Since you have a bounty, they'll say ""Wait, I know you,"" and they'll try to arrest you.  This gives you the chance to persuade them to let you go.

5) Rinse and repeat with new guards, but make sure not to persuade the same guard twice, or they'll not let you go."

TheDarkHorse83,AskMen,1388687961.0,"I remember we had a post here some time ago written by a male primary school teacher who would be harassed regularly by a mother that didn't even have children at that school. She would watch from the street during recess and yell at him for helping kids up after falling or getting them down out of a tree. Eventually a school administrator got the cops involved and banned her from the property.

Sir_Fancy_Pants,AskReddit,1388687962.0,"so looks like we can add ""doesn't understand ad hominem"" to your long list of failures also.

you see this is exactly why you are stupid, you dont understand principles or concepts and instead argue with no logical consistency, you argue as if you have some kind of ""look up table"" of arguments that arnt applicable or relevant and the fact you use them so incorrectly highlights how challenged you are.

its particularly wonderful how massively blind you are to your own hypocrisy. i mean seriously you should be embarassed you are this stupid.

worked example:

&gt;you just follow up your good points with needless insults. Insults that you, for some reason, deem necessary. They aren't. You're just an asshole. That isn't an insult, it's a fact.

&gt;you just follow up your bad points with incorrect logic. wrong logic that you, for some reason, deem necessary.  You're just an idiot. That isn't an insult, it's a fact.

only in your idiotic brain can you think one argument is perfectly valid and yet criticise the other.

but you know i have repeatedly exposed your hypocrisy, and you just conveniently try and ignore it, but its proof that you cant follow a consistent logical thought process and actually does validate the fact that you are an idiot.

blackinthmiddle,politics,1388687966.0,"&gt;You show up, do some homework, cobble together some IF statements, and four years later you get a piece of paper.

Once again, you're making statements without anything to back up what you're saying. You said 1 in 4 college graduates in 2017 will be a CS major and I asked you to back up that statement and instead of backing it up with actual data, you instead moved on and made another, unsubstantiated statement. 

For your latest unsubstantiated statement, there would be only one objective way to back it up: rates of drop out per major for every school in the country. For example, when I was in engineering school, 70% of initial engineering students dropped out. It would be interesting to see what the drop out rates are in 2013 per major for all schools throughout the country. That would be an *objective* measurement.

&gt;A CS degree at some no-name college is really no harder than any other degree; it's effectively just a participation award.

Again, back up what you're saying with some form of data or you're really just pulling shit out of your ass! Find out what the drop out rates per major for a recent year are. If psychology and CS are roughly the same, that would go a long way to proving your point. My guess is (and again, it's a guess because I don't have any data) the drop out rates for CS are high and will be similar to engineering. Now if you post back again, post with some data to back up what you're saying otherwise we're just wasting time here."

The implicit argument of my post was that contemporary 'white' societies are well organized because of first mover advantage. They industrialized first, they colonized the world, subjugated peoples, developed complex economies, and the power and prestige that Western countries used to become dominant nations.

Much - though certainly not all - of the struggle that contemporary industrializing nations face can be explained back to historical (and contemporary) domination/exploitation by powerful western nations.

Historically, both Rome and China ran very complex and stable societies for hundreds of years. There was no better place to live in than Rome in 100 CE or in China in 1200 CE. The notion that western european societies are better run is a contemporary one and historical context should be taken into account."

afropunk3,blackladies,1388688022.0,"&gt; You must be white, because if you were black, my tone wouldn't seem like anything but a statement of my opinion, and what seems to be an irrefutable fact. 
&gt; 

Your tone is a reflection of your opinion, and your opinion does not constitute irrefutable fact. An opinion is nothing more than an expression of a personal perspective, but an irrefutable fact would have to act as a universal truth that is applicable in all situations. The sidebar on this subreddit states that ""all narratives are welcome;"" since I didn't attempt to challenge your blackness or de-legitimize your opinion, I strongly hope that you will grant me the same treatment in this *civil discussion.* I do not disagree with all of your points, but I still have problems (logical problems, not tone problems) with your ideas.

&gt; Every other race holds their own, and we are the only ones who don't. Instead, we prefer to sleep with the enemy and make excuses for them, while being forced to give up our sovereignty, our history, our communities, and the rights to a comfortable, secure, fulfilling life (and accepting this at face value).
&gt;

These two sentences are artfully phrased to mask the truly offensive nature of their main arguments. You probably despise some of the members of this very community who are involved in/descended from interracial unions, and your classification of *all whites* as ""the enemy"" is a literal form of black-and-white thinking. The truth could never be this simplistic, and your goals are firmly rooted in ""sovereignty""/ethnic nationalism (when, in reality, it would be best to place focus on fighting the racism that exists in our current multicultural society).

&gt; If there was a chance for common ground and building bridges, then I missed it, because as far as I can tell, NOBODY else is interested in doing that with the black community, and we don't do it amongst ourselves. We don't have time any more to keep coddling everyone and trying to ""show them the light"". If someone was continually punching you in the face, would you try to reason with them, or would you punch them in the face?
&gt;

This is an extended version of a strawman argument coupled with a very poor analogy. Obviously, you cannot reach all non-blacks and communicate our message to them, and I never said it was your responsibility to try. Negotiate with those who are willing to listen, and pass by those who are not; make allies whenever that is possible, and ignore those who are opposed to your ethnic interests. Your usage of the categorical negative (i.e. ""NOBODY"" from another racial group is interested in reaching out to the black community) really trivializes your point; non-blacks do not belong to a hive mind, and they do not all think/behave in the same ways. Everyone may be affected by cultural stereotypes, biases, and the strong influences of historical discrimination, but it would be incorrect to assume that ""all"" whites are showing a unified front in their opposition to blacks. 

If you constantly imagine all of your enemies to be devils and all of your opponents to be demons, then you will never make any progress in your goal to defeat them; by elevating anti-black prejudice to the point of a massive global conspiracy, you make our foes seem far more powerful then they actually are. There are tons of racist people in high places, but every person who has anti-black attitudes does not hold a position of power. Racist people may exist in all areas of society, but they do not run the world, and they are not invincible. Decent/moral people of all races can help in the struggle against race prejudice, and I am not ready to reject potential allies off of the grounds that you have submitted so far.

Really can't agree with this more. Hit the nail on the head. If they weren't accepted, they would likely be killed off, just like how the early Homo Sapiens may have killed off the Neanderthals. (Sidenote: Some historians believe that the Neanderthals may have just been bred-in to Homo Sapiens forcibly. Food for thought...) 

&gt;hunted out of novelty

Not sure of this part... If they survived into modern times, surely there would be some kind of civil rights for them, i.e. protection of life by law, equal treatment, etc., or at least movements, just as there were for African Americans in the US.

&gt;desired by scientists to better understand what is happening.

This would be likely, but again, if they survived up to modern day, the populations would be large enough that there would likely be some willing to donate their bodies to science, just as there are in humans today. I guess,  however, if they were exposed to humans since the dawn of civilization, or even any earlier than 400 years ago, they may have been killed off before civilization reached the point it has.

&gt;I would think that all species could mate, including humans, but no interbreeding between species like their feral counterparts.

Not sure if I understand what you are saying here, could you clarify? Would mating between completely different species of furry be viable, such as anthro-wolf + anthro-eagle, or would it be more localized, such as anthro-wolf + anthro-dog? Also, would the human genes allow anthros to mix with all human types too?

&gt;Paw pads that are conducive, similar to human skin, would be a must for them to function in a modern human society.

Well, you're arguing a tautology here, once again. State sanctioned murder is, by its very definition, legal. However, that doesn't suddenly make it objectively morally worse, just more socially acceptable. The medellin drug cartel terrorizing and killing people is no worse than a state doing the same. 

&gt;The commie dictators said that too.

Commie dictators had different solutions to the problem than I do. Once again, stop ****ing strawmanning my position. I think Marx's critique of capitalism was accurate. It's just that his solution was about as unrealistic as your libertarian policies are. Communism doesn't work. Good thing that's not what I'm proposing. I'm proposing a system that works WITH capitalism, and ensures optimal personal freedom for INDIVIDUALS.

Are you aware that in a different time, in the heart of the cold war, in the 60s and 70s, my ideas were actually seriously debated in America? That's right. WHen we we FIGHTING communism, we seriously discussed putting my ideas into practice. Unfortunately they fell out of favor and as a result we ended up with this cluster**** of welfare programs that are only of limited efficacy, and stifled even more work requirements put on them by politicians. My plans eliminate this bureaucracy, something which should be very attractive to you.

GeoffreyArnold,short,1388688179.0,"&gt;You giving ""heightism"" as an excuse for literally everything is like telling a fat person that it's society's fault for them not being happy about being fat...

So, that might be true if I were giving heightism (no need for quotation marks) as an ""excuse"" for ""literally"" everything.  But even then, it wouldn't be exactly the same because having excess weight has health effects which can make one unhappy which have nothing to do with how others treat you.  If a person is unhappy about their height, it is probably due to heightism.  Otherwise, what is it to be unhappy about.  Other than social interactions, what are the negative implications of being short?  I can't think of a single bad thing about being short that hasn't anything to do with social interactions.  I guess you could have trouble reaching things, but that isn't usually cited as a reason for unhappiness.  

&gt;Some people are assholes, some people are ugly and some people are stupid. ""Society"" treating them differently (your definition of ""discrimination"") just because they also happen to be short is a bullshit excuse. 

Does this apply to racism too?  So, assume that a person is treated differently because they happen to be Black, but not because they are Black.  Would this mean that racism didn't exist or that any acknowledgment of it as a social force is ""a bullshit excuse""?  Same for homophobia.  Same for sexism.  Same for _____."

ogSPLICE,thewalkingdead,1388688188.0,"I happened to notice, that in the episode where Daryl and Merle run off, and help the Hispanic people on the bridge,there is some inconsistency with Daryl. 

When Merle rips off Daryls angel wing vest, and exposes the scars that were left from his abusive father, we notice that Daryls tattoos are on his right shoulder, left shoulder bare. In the next frame, when he gets up and walks away to the left, the tattoos are exposed on his left shoulder, leaving his right shoulder bare, and his vest is still ripped.  After Merle calls Glen chinese, and Daryl corrects him, and starts to walk through the woods, We see that Daryl now, only has 1 tattoo, instead of 2, also, on the wrong shoulder (the left) and his angel wing vest is back to being fully intacted, without a single tear down the back. 

This just leads me to believe that these scenes were shot out of order, on different days. Much like the scene were Bob gets shot in the shoulder, but one scene shows bobs bullet wound already there before he gets shot, and the next frame its gone, and the next its back again.  When the shows going at full speed, on release night, you dont notice these tiny things as your sucked into the story. But after watching the episodes, 2, 3, 4, 10 times ,you pick up on these. "

You clearly mentioned a much quieter bar and they are generally not very crowded. Unless you expect hundreds of bar-goers to sit in silence of course.

The differences between clubs, bars and any other similar place is the atmosphere. What you don't seem to grasp is that what you see as too loud, too crowded or too expensive is not a problem to other people, in fact, they may prefer it.

Canuck147,changemyview,1388688571.0,"In *Why the West Rules for Now*, Ian Morris discusses horsemen of the apocalypse which includes disease, famine, ecological disaster, and nomadic migrations as leading to societal collapse.

Many empires have been sundered by nomadic invasions from the Steppe, including the Mongols and the Huns. A strong empire can repel them, but one faced by famine and disease will likely collapse. One of the more important moments in history that is rarely address is the closing of the Steppe by China and Russia in the 1700s with the spread of modern forts and cannons. It's very possible that burgeoning European societies could have been shattered by a nomadic migration attracted by accumulating wealth, but modern technology mitigated that possibility. 

Geography played a huge role in the west's rise. The other major factor was timing. Western Europe began to industrialize at a time where the economic center was on the other side of the world, and when technology had advanced to the point that disease and migration were far less threatening than they had been even 200 years earlier."

021fluff5,learnprogramming,1388688614.0,"So, a couple of issues I noticed (/u/ebol4anthr4x covered everything else I was going to say).

You don't need comments for everything - excessive commenting actually makes your code harder to read. Ideally, you should have a multi-line comment at the top of the class that explains the function of your class. Before each of your methods (with the exception of the main method) write a little comment explaining the function of your method. 

[Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html) has a lot of example code that shows how you should be commenting your programs.

Variable names, method names, class names, and the code itself should be clear and obvious enough that you don't *need* a lot of comments. (In other words, don't call your class ""Class1,"" call it ""HelloUser"" or something more descriptive.)

duffmanhb,Games,1388688625.0,"Not at all. Platform games died because they couldn't evolve. They lived in the days where games had high memory restrictions so their extended play time had to come from increasing the difficulty. The difficulty which came from precision play (landing on small platforms, game speed increasing, more monsters). 

However now it's different. As memory increase, so does the available content. This allows games to evolve in whichever direction that's best. FPSs aren't going anywhere. They've been evolving since Wolfenstein and have been making constant progress since. 

No one is sure what the next generation is going but rumor has it Valve is betting on the MMO integrated concept for FPSs, much like Star Citizen. They've already shown that players like playing with other players, even when it's a campaign mode. So now other titles are starting to incorporate this idea. But like I said, the next gen is probably going to be much more MMO integrated. Campaigns are likely to include tons of cooperating and even competing players. "

And architecture could only be defined to follow an ideology or a cult in the most mundane and shallow terms.  So if due to paintings of saints and angels, you're going to throw the whole architectural practices of Europe prior to the Renaissance under the label of ""Christian"" then you're being very simplistic in your definition.  Yes, there are influences of religion (as you said - Islam banned images of living animals and humans) but that is hardly relevant to the dome structure, columns, architraves and designs of buildings.  [Infact, I believe the colours and shapes of columns you find in Arabic conquered Spain are done to mimic the shape of palm trees.](http://i.imgur.com/04daKm2.jpg)  Absolutely nothing to do with the Islamic cult.  Domes are taken from the Babylonians and minarets from the Persians.

Put all these near each other, and they can cause a lot of interference, which makes your wifi operate slower. So, you can get a router that can also broadcast at 5GHz. For devices that support it (any dual-band device) you will typically see better network throughput (faster wifi) because there's so much less interference. It's not a huge deal if you don't have a lot of things using 2.4GHz, but if you're like us and have a microwave (not as much of a big deal as the others but it can mess up signal in your kitchen when in use, and our kitchen is right by the TV and Roku), cordless phone, wireless headphones and keyboard over 2.4GHz, the Roku itself (plus the remotes on the 2 and 3 use Wi-fi Direct to connect), not to mention a plethora of computers, tablets, and phones all on wifi, 5GHz can be a godsend for devices that support it.

Handyland,bodyweightfitness,1388688819.0,"Wow, lots of people are making a lot of assumptions about what I said.

First off, this is coming out of a book that's probably 15 years old, but is a general training guide for distance running written by someone who was/is pretty well-respected in the sport.  What he said is that you should be, in your training, getting to distances farther than your race distance, at 70% of your target race pace (or thereabouts.  It's been a while).  Maybe for a marathon, double is unnecessary, but the idea was to be going farther by a **solid** margin on your long runs by the time the event is starting to near.

I never said to be hitting this the week before the race.  The week before your target event is always a light week and, like you said, doing something strenuous would be detrimental.

I'll repeat again that this is advice for the competitive runner.  If someone's goal is to finish a marathon, disregard it.  But I'm rather shocked at the suggestion by several people here that, when running competitively, you only do the distance that your event is *on the actual event day*...  That's preposterous.  The people who are going to olympic trials have done marathon distance days and longer as part of their training, or else they weren't training for a marathon."

Cookster997,furry,1388688946.0,"You said poop twice... what about urine?

Seriously though, you are right that all possible furries would have to satisfy the basic needs of life. 

Also, just as Dogs and Cats fight, so do humans... Think about it. We are killing large groups of each other just because we disagree on trivial things, or dislike the appearance of each other. I fear that a furry community would just be another powder keg thrown into that fire that has been burnin' since the world's been turnin' although we didn't necessarily start it...

Halfcore,techsupport,1388688949.0,"This sounds like an easy conversion of your server to a virtual machine. You can then send the image to your provider. Microsoft has disk2vhd for this. VMware has the vCenter converter. Just make sure RDP is open to the server once it is in the cloud and use it like you do now. You stil need to maintain patches and administer the OS. I would upgrade the OS if your software supports Server 2008R2 or 2012. Fast Manager is going to be your weakest link, as it sounds like a small, private software produced by a small, private company. These line-of-business packages usually have slower maintenance cycles to support new OS's.

If this sounds like crazy, I'd get a virtualization expert involved.

As with any move to ""cloud"", please remember that doing this exposes your data to whoever is hosting your server. If you are not worried about privacy, virtualized servers in a hosting plan are fine. If you have sensitive data I would recommend owning your own equipment that your server runs on. Either way, this does not obviate maintenance and administration of the virtual server.

PS. Quickbooks Online would probably eliminate the need to maintain a Quickbooks install on your server, also. Again, privacy concerns should be addressed first."

hopewings,infj,1388688952.0,"Well, being INFJ in itself is being an ""exception,"" since we're pretty rare birds in general.  But I see what you are saying, that gaming is not the problem, people are.  I don't think my husband and I are exceptionally mature either, as we are both admittedly kind of lazy and aren't really as attentive and good with our son as we should be.  

Pregnancy and raising children are no cakewalks, that's for sure.  One thing to keep in mind is that women like to talk among each other about their relationship problems, especially with their female friends, so it can sound like the husband is the bad guy when he's probably not so bad.  I tend to not talk about relationship things in public at all, instead discuss them with my husband privately, and we generally come to a good compromise.  But pregnancy/post-partum and altered hormones can really wreak havoc on even good relationships.  My husband and I had some pretty major issues when I went on birth control pills, so I went off them after a month.

Anyway, one thing to keep in mind is that because we are kind of weirdos/INFJs, what we think of as good may not be what other people think of as good.  Society tends to value the extroversion traits, which involves confidence, action and showmanship, and these can look like ""self-improvement"" such as New Year's resolutions to lose weight, etc.  INFJs tend to value morality, intuition, emotional and intellectual depth, which aren't easily expressed socially, and ""self-improvement"" to us means something much more wholistic than just outward appearances."

pathein_mathein,badhistory,1388688953.0,"Coffee (all stimulants really) are known to interfere in iotan clarity. While originally banned because of its risk of preventing Exaltation, more modern Mormonological research suggests that iotans only deal with navigation through the Dharmaverse. Due to the modern theomonadic standards for God Particle attraction (at the millinoor ever since widespread acceptance of the Chesterton protocols) this really shouldn't matter. You might end up on Jovar as opposed to Venya, which might be an embarrassment but hardly wrong, and a far cry from when you risked a Moldvay injunction. But old habits die hard, and it's easier just to ban things like coffee, race music, and swearing rather than trying to set up a complicated series of rules.

With Romney, though, Mormonism was merely a cover. Romney is actually a sentient Treasury Bond that defected to the Finance industry. Big Banking was able to use technology that Academi brought back from Cydonia to give it a body; why they ended up cloning Rommel to do so is still a point of speculation, but the thought was to create a financier that could avoid coffee to prevent Zionist influence; we all know how *that* worked out..."

My best advice would be to sit down and think through why you are feeling this way and what you can do to change how you feel. Things that are external (like your ex getting married) aren't really going to help/hurt you, but examining how you feel may help to figure out what it is about your life that you need to change to be happier. Don't focus on someone else's life and relationships because it will just divide your attention from your own.

Let's face it - you're not doing this out if consideration for his feelings.  You're doing it so you don't have to see his feelings hurt, and deal with the aftermath.  Do the right thing.

BullsLawDan,legaladvice,1388689140.0,"Neither.  The carrier/self-insured employer gets an Independent Medical Evaluation - a doctor chosen by the carrier.  Then, we litigate which doctor is better.  Takes months.  Every single medical issue - degree of temporary disability, degree of permanent disability, need for treatment, need for surgery, further disability after return to work, *everything*, gets litigated that way.

In 2007, we moved to capped permanent benefits, before that, a permanency rating basically meant lifetime benefits.  But they forgot to finish our new permanency guidelines, so no one can agree on anything as far as permanency ratings, and every single case is litigated.  Literally, judges are trying to determine a % of permanent impairment by pulling numbers out of thin air.

It's one reason why, a few years ago, a company wanted to do a state-by-state evaluation of comp systems, and surveyed to find out how many hearings each state had.  They wound up with a misprint in their book, because they thought they had accidentally put an extra zero on the number for NY.  The NY WCB told them the number was something like 500,000, they thought that couldn't possibly be right, and printed ""50,000"".... Nope, it's really 500,000.

sammiemichelle,relationships,1388689283.0,"I wouldn't trust someone I have been dating for 2 months to be 100% faithful forever. I would stick to condoms to protect yourself just in case.

If you feel comfortable with two methods, then stick to two methods. Just an FYI: I have been taking the pill for 3 years, and have never had an accident. The pill is very reliable if she is taking it correctly, but if you are not ready to be a dad and you know she wouldn't terminate the pregnancy, then by all means stick to two methods! 

If a condom makes sex so bad for her, then that's *her* problem. A condom doesn't change sex that much, and it's supposed to be more than just the feeling of sex when you care for someone. She shouldn't be pressuring you to go without a condom. That's high school crap."

There is also Citadel, which lets you use resources to ""reinforce"" a block. When you reinforce a block, it makes it so you have to break the block multiple times before it is actually destroyed.

You're assuming that the OP is returning the flirtation, which he might be - but I don't see the fact that the bartender propositioned him for sex as something he *should* be telling his wife, especially if it's a nonissue for him which could only escalate into an actual problem.

To tell you the truth, I think Brits are not much different with drinking (especially that well known binge drinking and number of pubs you have) with a difference that Poles possibly drink stronger spirits (thus quicker damage).

&gt; Are you concerned Romanians going to under cut your pay by working cheaper and putting more people in smaller homes?

There is a risk they will do so (cut wages), especially at the beginning but since I think that from whole Eastern Europe didn't come such a lot of people (total 1.5% of UK's population) even if Romanian and Bulgarians were to add another 0.5% it won't be that much noticeable. Also, don't forget that NOBODY wants to work below what others earn in the same type of industry. Being an EU national means that eventually they will want to earn more and be equal with others or just within pricing distance which makes certain work competitive (rather than seriously undercut wages).

&gt; Are the Poles and Romanians going to go to war here?

Why would they do that? My Polish cousin is already dating a Romanian guy whom I have met personally. He looks and talks just like any other normal person. In fact, his English is so good I wouldn't know he came from Eastern Europe."

MightyMackinac,anchorage,1388689442.0,"I moved up from Texas, San Antonio to be exact. So I know exactly how you feel. While I'm not as knowledgeable on the political, I can give you some info on the rest.

Cons: Anchorage is a city of about 300K people, which means that things are kind of crowded in-city. There are very few good restaurants and fast food places. No Chick-fil-a, Sonic, Whataburger, Taco Cabana, Chipotle, etc. We have McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's, Arby's, and some others. And the closest they are is California, so if you get cravings, you will have to travel haha. Roads suck and are constantly being fixed, thanks to frost heaves. Anything you can't buy up here, you have to ship, and that takes forever.

Someone once said, ""We pay property tax, income tax, and shipping charges."" It sucks to ship to Alaska.

Pros: uh...Snow? No Sales Tax in Anchorage. Once you get outside of Anchorage, there is sales tax. Yearly PFD. Absolutely gorgeous views of the mountains that surround the city. Anchorage is a very pretty place to live. Fastest internet in the state.

Most of the crime in Anchorage is usually petty theft, sexual assault, and drunk driving. Generally, if you stay away from Northside, Mountain View, and Downtown, you should be ok. 

If you choose to live in Eagle River, but work in Anchorage, expect lots of traffic on the Glenn Highway as there are hundreds of people who do the same thing. The Glenn Highway is the only highway in or out of Anchorage to the rest of the world. If there is an accident on the Glenn the whole thing shuts down and nobody goes anywhere.

If you love the outdoors, then Alaska is the place for you. There is so much to do outdoors every season, that its your own fault if you are bored. But if you want to stay indoors, you might have a little trouble. There are a couple movie theaters, bowling alleys, and a shitty arcade in the Dimond mall.

Spanish is surprisingly common, but not as much as Texas. Vietnamese is also very popular. 

Word to the Wise: DO NOT expect good mexican food up here. They all suck, compared to the awesome tex-mex that you can get down South. especially, Taco King. DO NOT GO TO TACO KING.

If/When you do get up here, I have a couple other people who moved up from Texas, so we need to have a get together and make some of our favorite missed foods.

This is why some people get spinal fusion, because there is no more cushion and the vertebrae are constantly grinding on each other.  

Your core supports the spine.  In my case, the muscle spasm in my lower back (core) was pulling my spine in a way so the vertebrae were constantly grinding each other, so I had double the pain.  The spasm itself feels like a really bad cramp in your back, the herniated disc pain is just a sharp pain that never goes away.  

I'm not sure how else to describe it.  

&gt; Does ibuprofen work on pain from herniated disk as well? 

No, not at all.  Ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory.  It's best for reducing swelling.  It helped with the muscle spasm, but what helped more was muscle relaxors.  Still, the pain never went away because of the herniated disc.  

I would say if you're having pain from a herniated disc, your best bet would probably be aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol).  For anti-inflammatory medication, I find Sodium-Niacin works best for me (Aleve).  

That said, I had some vicodin available for my worst days, and it didn't really help too much other than put me to sleep and make me feel a bit high.  "

fiat_lux_,asktrp,1388689473.0,"Those images aren't fair to either girl.

One of them has extra lighting and looks like a glamour shot. The other image looks like it was taken off stage.

There's different purposes for makeup.

Stage makeup for theatre/stageplay, for instance, tends to be extra gaudy up close, simply because it's meant to be complement facial features from a distance at multiple angles. It doesn't come with the benefits of airbrushing and special-purpose lighting. I have friends who did theatre, and they looked like clowns up close after a play.

We shouldn't compare our own efforts to that of celebrities. Analyze first what the purpose is.

As to your original question... it varies from guy to guy. I personally find it flattering if a woman puts effort into herself. 

Also, some people seriously need it. I have a friend who suffered from horrible acne. When she finally broke out of her depression and decided she wanted out, she used makeup to hide it while using acutane for a more permanent solution. A lot of people will give us ""feel good"" advice about how all that counts is what's on the inside, but not everyone is perfectly rational. It made her feel good to hide what most people would find aesthetically unpleasant, so more power to her."

So I did this on that flight and the pilot was showing off his new aircraft. Just for grins he changed the destination from CGH (São Paulo - Congonhas) to JFK (New York, or course).

After he keyed in the new destination and pushed a couple of buttons, the plane leaned a bit to the left and started a slow turn. At the same time an alarm started blaring something like ""WARNING - FUEL - WARNING - FUEL"" or some such, indicating we didn't have enough fuel for that destination.

ecclectic,AskReddit,1388689581.0,"Do kegels, it's the single easiest thing you can do.  Flex the muscle that you normally would to stop the flow of urine, practice flexing it, SLOWLY build up how long you can hold it and how hard you can flex it (you can cause damage if you do too much too quickly.) Then learn to control the mucsles of your lower abdomen.  Like then you're trying to piss faster and you flex that muslce?  There's one just under that that you can learn to isolate.  It's half-way between pushing out a deuce and squeezing your bladder.

just before you orgasm, flex both muscles at the same time, it will put pressure on your prostate.  Enjoy.

The other benefit to kegels is if you do the opposite of flexing (it's like a forced relaxing?) you can achieve a 'dry' orgasm and keep on going.  just when you feel that you're about to orgasm, force the PC muscle to relax, stop masturbating for a few seconds and you'll either make a mess or you'll have a dry orgasm. If the former, clean up and try again next time, it takes a bit of practice.  If the latter, have fun and see how many times you can do it.

Truth is, in the middle of the draft, you're going to be picking from a selection of guys that mostly graded out about even. So you probably are going to get to tailor that pick to a position of need a little bit.

Jeffreyrock,changemyview,1388689646.0,"The first thing to note is that this is a matter of perspective-- many ideas that offer solace to some seem wholly ridiculous to others.

The view I hold is that the purpose of life is for us to evolve by self effort towards higher states if consciousness until we ultimately perceive ourselves in perfect unity with God and Nature.  In the Bhagavad Gita it teaches, among other things, that human being is a soul encased by 3 bodies, each more subtle than the next-- an outer gross body of flesh and matter, an astral body of intelligent energy, and a causal body of thought.  Physical death comes when the soul, still encased by the astral and causal bodies, flees the physical body.  

There is no cessation of consciousness or loss of self awareness (they say) when death comes, it is tantamount to the shedding of an old used up garment,or having a rest.  It is true that we don't remember the specifics of each life to the next-- it is said that this is a very fortunate thing, because if each of us remembered all the treachery and sufferings and setbacks of former lives we could have a harder time being motivated to carry on.  Death, in this sense, is a blessing.  What we do carry with us from life to life are our latent personality traits and dispositions-- if you're a bigoted alcoholic in one life, then you will carry this with you as seed tendencies until you deal with them in future lives. 

Also, if we form deep relationships with people, if we happen to meet them in future lives that connection will still be intact, often with a deep, if obscured, sense of comfort and connection when we meet them.  It is written that no spiritual progress once gained is ever lost.  The same is true with our relationships with people.  Death muddies the water a little bit, but ultimately it doesn't take anything of value from us.  It gives us a break, and paves the way for fresh opportunities for growth in the future.  Also, it happens to everyone, good or bad, so it can't be a bad thing."

I don't think anyone is truly ready for it, they just become open to and even excited about the idea of meeting their future offspring. I knew that I was ok with being a father when I was intrigued about the idea of seeing what kind of little person my wife and I could create. And you know what? He's pretty awesome.

The only trick to parenthood is walking into it with your eyes open. You have to walk into it knowing full well that your primary responsibility in life will be to ensure the growth and well-being of a little life that is going to depend on you for virtually *everything.* You can't walk into it thinking that raising a child will be just like your current life, but with a kid.

THe rest I them even in context is just bullshit dribble that every political ideal has.

But that one is genuinely fucked up.

Not only do men and boys lose their uncles, brothers, fathers, grandfathers, and now sometimes significant others, and most importantly *their best friends in front of their own eyes*, but are also carelessly sent to die for someone else's ideals*.

My uncle served in the first gulf war and is still trying to forget what he saw. I hang out at the VFW (veterans bar) and the biggest rule is is don't talk about the war (which one? Any of them). Watching a grown man fall apart emotionally is one of the most painful things to watch.

How has watching sports (as opposed to playing) become associated with what men are *supposed* to do? The fact that you bring this up means you did not understand the definition of “go find interests that **improve** you”. But you enjoy photography, and that is a great first suggestion.

Activities that improve you include things like:

- Learning an instrument.

- Playing sports, which improves your socialization skills while keeping your body fit.

- Fitness training, leading an active lifestyle to improve your body as well as your sense of personal motivation, and expanding that will to accomplish things to other areas of your life.

- Reading and writing, a mix of nonfiction to learn more about how the world works, and classic fiction that inspires and motivates you. (You can use some work on your writing skills, by the way. It is a learned skill to be able to communicate clearly and concisely. Again, you need work in this area.)

- Art, including photography, which allows you to share your experiences and thoughts to other human beings in visual ways. The impact you have on others through your work will only be the result of time intensive tinkering and improving of one's skills. Join a website and open your work to criticism, the better the artist criticizing you, the better the artist you become. Attend a conference, meet others honing their craft, etc.

- And many more.

Personally, after quitting Dota 2, I started using my time exercising, began to tutor English to foreign students starting with one and now two students a week, started re-practicing difficult piano songs I gave up on in highschool, and spend my free time learning about personality types (like MBTI theory) and about socially minded business models (like microcredit). I can say for myself that taking up these challenges has been rewarding and I am learning to experience a higher level of happiness that combines pleasure and growth.

Chocobean,Parenting,1388689844.0,"I celebrated my toddler's second birthday recently, at home. It was a huge success for the following reasons (ymmv).

She has no baby friends. Going to a gymboree would be too expensive with very little gains for all the adult party goers.

The two other babies who attended, and their charges, were only here for two or so hours anyway.

The adults wanted to stick around, hang out and chat. Too expensive outside, and most rental places are either loud or can only be booked for two hours.

Making it special: my girl saw us decorating the day before. The anticipation is half the fun. It also gave us time too explain birthdays, teach her how to say happy birthday, and be excited on cue when we sing the song, instead of looking blankly and confused.

Without having to worry about making it on time, organizing naps and leaving  before sugar crash overload and screaming in the car, she woke from nap finding loved ones outside her bedroom, and went to bed with everyone wishing her a happy birthday and waving byebye.

Fridges and stuff for food much easier to organize.

Birthday artifacts remained in place for a week or two or three afterwards. She'd pass by a balloon, say hapoy birthday, sing the song, and continue with her day. We deflated balloons together, took down streamers together. It's fun that the birthday ""season"" dwindle away slowly instead of being a huge let down when it all magically disappears. 

This may or may not work next year, because her friends will be a factor and the cousins will be mobile. But we wanted a party ""our way"" before succumbing to the inevitable gymboree galas. Check with me next new years day to see how our third went if you like.

Just my exp :)"

etruscan,boardgames,1388689933.0,"I've played innumerous games with my wife (actually, it's probably around 10-15 games), and we've played a couple of three player games. I actually think I might like this one best as a two player.

It's very abstract. I enjoy the utopian city building theme, but it's pretty hidden in Ginkgopolis. Really, this is a puzzle game with a convenient theme attached, but it's a really great puzzle. I like that the tide of the game can seemingly shift wildly every turn, but it never feels like I'm way behind or out of the game even if the other player had a really great turn.

...I'm also never sure how the game will end. Some games you can easily guess who won. Others, like this one, are completely obtuse. It's tough to tell who won until you've done the final tally.

I would call it a medium weight euro game. It's not particularly light (I'm still stumped every time I go to set it up) but it's not really heavy either. I'm a big fan of Xavier Georges... I like his approach to designing games. He's got a very puzzly mind, but he seems to like to tie that to a theme as strongly as possible. With Ginkgopolis, even though it's an abstract puzzle game, that theme is still there. Troyes is another game that's pretty abstract (it's all dice!) but each card is so thematic. 

I just grabbed a copy of Carson City, so I'm excited to see how his vision translates to the wild west."

Nothing, most likely.  Like most games of this type, you don't *have* to buy anything, but you have the option if you want to get things quicker.

&gt; If you want to build something relatively big like a battleground (once PvP tools are implemented), will you have to buy 10+ claims at an unreasonably high price to get enough land for it?

No particular reason to think so.

&gt; Will prices on claims skyrocket when all the cool spots are taken?

In a procedurally generated world, this can never happen.  There will always be an infinite number of untaken cool spots available for those willing to go explore.

That, of course, takes time -- where money comes into games of this sort is from people who have more money than time."

EDIT: Since I always wind up posting the above whenever this thread comes around, I'm going to post a few other top comments to make this slightly different than usual.

Here's my number three comment, at 648 points:

&gt;It's a tactic to use guilt to keep people from killing themselves, adding to their mental anguish, rather than addressing any of the issues they're already having and helping them cope in a healthy manner.

&gt;It treats the person like they're second rate. Rather than ""Don't kill yourself because your problems have solutions and happiness is possible"", it's ""Don't kill yourself because people that love you will be sad and their happiness is more important than your own.""

&gt;Here's a simple counter-argument: If persons A &amp; B meet and become good friends, then if A dies first, B will be sad, but if B dies first, A will be sad. The sadness is guaranteed. It's worth it to have the happiness they had while together, but it's already there. WHEN you die has no effect on it. Therefore, killing oneself is not creating that sadness, it's getting it over with. It was always guaranteed. It is therefore not a selfish act.

&gt;I'm not endorsing suicide... But there are far better methods of helping people than this one.

IngwazK,TumblrInAction,1388690064.0,"This could be something about the movie equestrian girls, but I'm not sure since they're talking about pets.  If its about the episode may the best pet win, one of the characters is having a competition to find the pet that is the most suited to her athletic personality.  A friend suggested a tortoise, and obviously tortoises are naturally slow creatures so the character says no, multiple times.  In the end, the character gets put in a life threatening situation and the tortoise saves her life, earning her respect And showing her that even if personalities don't match perfectly, people can still be friends and look out for each other.  

If its referencing the movie, in the movie, the main character is going to a school dance.  She is asked by her love interest if she would go with him, and then while being asked, realizes there is a massive mistake about something and runs off shouting ""NO!"" repeatedly.  The love interest takes this in stride and accepts it as a rejection.  Later, he sees her before they she enters for the school dance, and says that although he was rejected for a date, he was hoping she'd dance with him once.  Main character explains the confusion of the original rejection saying ""i didn't mean no to you, and spends the dance with him.  

People have been misconstruing the later to mean ""no doesn't actually mean no ever since the movie aired, even though its very clear that you have to remove any context and deliberately twist the meaning in order to arrive at that conclusion.

It has all but died off outside very insular groups like the Amish. However, up until the stigma against all-things German arose during WWI, German was the second most spoken language in America, even with large publication areas of German newspapers.  Up until just the most recent several decades, many people that were born at the cusp of that time would have been speaking German in their homes, which would have led to the later generations of this time still speaking it, albeit in a waning form.

Well some woman are sure, but not a majority, just like I don't think it's a majority of men who are convinced people will see them as pedos. I never really encounter this ""Everyone will think I'm a pedo if I interact with children"" fear outside of Reddit (other than my own pre-teaching fears). If any of the male teachers I've met and worked with shared that concern, they never gave any indication of it.

I've worked with kids in several environments, from volunteering at an after school program in college to teaching at tech camps to visiting my friend's classroom as a guest speaker, and the only time in my life anyone has accused me of being a pedo was when I was in a junior in high school and thought a freshman girl was cute. And this was all in the heart of Chicago, not a small town or suburb.

I get ""no'd"" whenever I want to implement a new policy. My team had real trouble with communicating to staff that we are a service provider to them- so I know first hand what this team is going through. I'm a huge fan of forms and structured systems so I always go to if there's problem communicating and tracking staff- let's create a form they can submit that will give you all the content you need while letting staff feel like they don't have to write their own marketing tactic. 

I also get ""no'd"" when I request a budget plan for any marketing needs. I wanted to create a small Education Card that highlights our trainings that we can leave at the various events staff attend, but was told that it would cost too much money. I asked if we could consider spending a bit of money and take out adds in various places where we could reach potential clients and I'm told we have no money for that.

I want to work with this team, and I totally understand their frustrations with staff communications- yet, I can only complain so much and get frustrated that the team dynamic is so off that any idea of change or criticism sets them into a really negative place. 

Edit: Also- you just opened a whole new world of agile marketing! I have no idea what scrum was/meant and now I've made it a goal of mine to become an expert! Thank you!"

Does he regularly make jokes where he's ""busting"" on you like that? Do you feel like he takes it to far at times? Does he seem to have less respect for ladies who have sex/are sexual? Or is he just generally bad with social cues? Details such as these really change how this situation could be perceived.

I would definitely take a moment and consider what your definition of love is. So you are having ex troubles (I can only assume this ended rather recently) and yet, you are already in love with someone that you aren't actually dating who lives a distance away.

Stop worrying so much about what's going through women's heads and figure out your own.

To demonstrate a point by answering your ""what ifs"" explicitly:

1. Crooked nose? Bad timing? I call that spilled milk. That's life. Move on.
2. Met a great girl but had no money? Spilled milk again. Move on, and maybe get a job, you bum.
3. Some guy is better and more attractive than you in every measurable way, plus certain intangibles? Spilled milk. Move on, and maybe learn from his clearly superior game.

When I met my boyfriend (now fiancé) during Senior year, I blew the fuck up. I gained 40 lbs in a year because I ended up eating as much as he did (he's overweight).

 I got pregnant, and gained 20 lbs (lost it all afterward). I then realized how big I was and figured it was, yes, genetics and slow metabolism. Most of the women on my mothers side got fat after having kids, so I thought that was the fate I was condemned to.

About February or March of 2013, I decided I was going to start losing weight. I was about 190 lbs at that time. I googled ""how to lose weight"" and stuff like that, and read the usual junk that you see ""exercise every day and eat whole grains and fruit juice, etc"". Nothing about calories in, calories out. 

Eventually I stumbled across the myfitnesspal website, made an account (had no idea at this point that it was a calorie counting place) and made a post asking how to lose weight. I asked if decreasing portions sizes would help me lose weight, no matter what I ate. I said that I didn't have a problem with food and that I have a slow metabolism (lol). People did not give me a definite answer, so I was discouraged. I was starting to think that it really was genetics.

Learned about counting calories somewhere, so I started counting them on a piece of paper. It was not accurate, and I still ended up overeating too much and losing no weight. Got more and more discouraged.

Came across the loseit subreddit and somewhere in those posts, I found myfitnesspal again. This time I knew it was about calories. Decided to give counting calories another try. Downloaded the app, started using it, found /r/fatpeoplestories, eventually found /r/fatlogic, and now I'm almost 55 lbs down and 70% happier and more confident."

I'm pretty sure that that's exactly it.  I enjoy podcast jokes being in the series episodes, because we already know that they're actually friends, and the jokes work pretty well if you pretend it's some alternative universe separate from the podcast universe where they say these things not as friends.  I'm not sure if I explained what I mean very well, but the point is that we know they're just acting *anyway*, so there might as well be some... fun?  If that makes any sense?"

I just edited my response, so I'm gonna more or less repost this here, since it's relevant to your other garbage responses.

You apparently are ignorant of history, as many people are, and have fallen for the revisionism of the the far right, but you know, my plans were once very seriously discussed in washington? Milton Friedman, who is not a communist by any means, proposed replacing welfare with a negative income tax, which is similar to my basic income idea. Richard Nixon, that small government republican, proposed a guaranteed annual income, which failed, but was still discussed.

These ideas were being thrown around in CAPITALIST America during the height of the COLD WAR. That's right, ideas similar to my own were discussed and debated while we were FIGHTING communism!

You've fallen into the Reagan paradigm and the libertarian movement which has offshot from it here in the US. You forget our Keynesian past, and chalk it up as a failure even though it was one of the most successful times in American History!!! You blame the government for inefficienies, when they're inefficient because we;'ve chosen inferior solutions and proposed more red tape on welfare because of ideas like yours. 

You're an extremist. Plain and simple. You're a right wing extremist. And thats why you think everyone else is a communist. You have absolutely no sense of the political spectrum, and everything for you is extremism. You're a libertarian nutjob, plain and simple. I wouldnt even be surprised if you're a tool of the Koch brothers or the Mises institute or some other extremist movement. You're brainwashed by the rich and powerful to think that giving them the keys to society is gonna help everyone, and that everything else would be a communist takeover of America.

I pity you and your ignorance and hope you learn."

ronearc,food,1388690286.0,"Pretty standard stuff really. 

For the steak, I used a cast iron skillet. I got my skillet smoking hot - about 5 minutes on high heat in a dry skillet. I didn't add any oil to the skillet, but I did rub both sides of the steak with Avocado Oil. You can probably find it at Whole Foods - it has a very high smoke point. 

I then put the steak (seasoned only with Kosher Salt) into the skillet, and about every 15-20 seconds, I flipped the steak over. When it had a really nice crust, but still wasn't done yet on the inside (about 5 minutes of flipping it every 15-20 seconds), I turned the heat to low, placed the steak at the top of the skillet, added 2 tbsps of salted butter to the bottom of the skillet along with two twigs of Rosemary. 

I then tilted the skillet (with a really good oven mitt, because the handle of that cast iron skillet was crazy hot by then). With the steak at the top of the tilted skillet and the melted butter at the bottom along with the rosemary, I used a large metal spoon and basted the steak in the melted rosemary butter until I reached the desired doneness - maybe another minute or so, depending how thick your steak is. 

I then covered it loosely with foil to let it rest for at least five minutes (more like 10) while I finished off everything else.

For the mushroom risotto, I used about 6 ounces of fresh shiitakes and chanterelles. I coarsely chopped the mushrooms, and then I sweated them down in Olive Oil until they'd released all their water. 

I started a dutch oven on medium heat and added two large garlic cloves, smashed with the flat of my blade and let those cook some. Before they could brown, I transferred the garlic out with a slotted spoon to my stock pot which had 6 cups of chicken broth and 1.5 cups of white wine mixed and simmering. 

I diced two large shallots and sweated those in the dutch oven with garlic-infused olive oil until they were tender and translucent (about 4-5 minutes). I then turned the heat to low, added two cups of arborio rice, and stirred to coat. I kept stirring about 2-3 minutes. 

I then added two cups of the chicken broth/white wine mixture to the rice and kept stirring. Every time it dried out, I added another lade of broth/wine (about 1/2 cup at a time). So basically, every 4 minutes or so, I added another ladle. I kept going until all the liquid was used and absorbed. So about 45 minutes of stirring and adding hot liquid. 

When that was done, I mixed in the mushrooms, stirred well, checked the seasoning, added a bit of salt, and then I added 2 tbsps. of unsalted butter and about 2 ounces of shredded parmesan cheese and stirred that in to melt the butter and cheese, and to thicken the risotto. I then garnished with fresh chives. 

For the scallops. I rinsed them really well, patted them as dry as I could with paper towels and right before they went in the cast iron, I salted them with kosher salt. 

For the cast iron, I put it on high and let it pre-heat for about 4 minutes until it was ""almost smoking"". I then added a fair amount of olive oil (enough to coat the bottom) and about 2 tbsps. of salted butter. Once the butter was melted, the scallops went into the skillet for 3 minutes. At which point I flipped them and cooked them another minute and plated. 

For the asparagus, I just snapped off the woody ends, salted them with kosher salt, put them in a large flat tupperware with a 1/4 cup of water. Put the lid on and microwaved them for 2 minutes and 15 seconds. 

Plate it up, photos, feast. :)"
totosmaster,AdviceAnimals,1388690287.0,"Never thought of that, but no, I didn't allow my kids to put items on the list. But I always thanked them for their good behavior in stores, and fed them well at home, so they were OK. Just talking with them calmly beforehand, and thanking them during and after shopping seemed to do the trick (and I wouldn't guilt-trip them by saying we didn't have any money or anything - just said ""no"" when they asked). On rare occasions, I would allow them to have a treat and they would be sincerely grateful. 

Except they grooved on getting physical rewards at the library. My kids LOVED getting stickers on their book sheets each week for how many ever pages they would read. And they've continued to be voracious readers. 

I haven't been scared of my children's outbursts, and expected better behavior, which they gave. This issue is really, really hard, because there were so many times I just wanted them to be quiet and to give in to their demands, but I'm glad I didn't because for the most part, we've had great relationships.

After I got sufficient with the P90 I switched to sniper rifles for a bit and then onto rifles. 

The reason I went to snipers after the spraytastic P90 was because it forced me to be more accurate. I started aiming for the head with every gun I used and overall it improved my play even though I don't enjoy sniping. 

I would say start with the P90 because it is easy to handle, once you are comfortable with that gun switch to a gun that forces you to improve your play in an area you feel is lacking. "

TheLittleGoodWolf,todayilearned,1388690377.0,"Yes it can. Sexism is defined as ""prejudice or discrimination based on a person's gender or sex."" To reach optimal clarity here, the word prejudice ""refers to prejudgment, or forming an opinion before becoming aware of the relevant facts of a case"" or more commonly ""refers to a positive or negative evaluation of another person based on their perceived group membership.""

In this definition any action taken that discriminates (restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to another group) people based on gender, for whatever reason, is sexist.

Intent does in no way matter in these situations, however intent itself can be *based* on sexism. The intent towards a stranger of a specific gender is *based* on sexism. You have the that specific intent towards the stranger because that person is of a specific gender (and most probably because of your earlier interactions with said gender but that is beside the point). The intent self is not sexist but the reasoning behind the intent is. Any action made because of the intent is also sexist since the action preformed because of the prejudicial notions of the person in regards to the gender. *phew*

This is why I call myself both sexist and prejudicial, and rightly so too. I treat people I perceive to be women in a certain way simply because I perceive them to be women, that makes me sexist and prejudicial. I also treat all people certain ways depending on which societal groups I perceive them to be members of.

All that of course changes once I get to know the person more and treat them more tailored to my perceptions of how they behave, reason, and what abilities they have. I find this to be a quite reasonable approach."

Not much. Aside from age and citizenship requirements, anyone can run. They just aren't likely to get more than a few votes. The majority of people will likely still vote Democrat or Republican.

This isn't really something new. Lots of third party and independent candidates run, they just don't have much support or money so you rarely hear about them.

I inherited really nice Bose speakers so I started with the receiver since I absolutely love music and want the ability to pump quality sound throughout my home. After getting responses to this post  I realized that a 4k compatible system was going to be outside my price range at the moment but I still need a system that I can use for the time being, that can work smoothly with the receiver and file size, but still with the ability to be upgraded later on as I save the money.

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388690652.0,"&gt;It's dangerous to link the wrongness of an outcome of an event to what you assume most women are there for - you don't have perfect knowledge of what attendees are thinking or wanting.

That's true. It's largely irrelevant though. Expecting large throngs of drunk, sexually excited people to display care, forethought and attention to subtle nuances of behavior is a stupid, pig-headed and unreasonable expectation.  

&gt;Sex (or groping, or whatever) should be a consensual act, no matter where it takes place or under what circumstance. A stranger grabbing my breast either is or is not ok - it doesn't ""become ok"" in different circumstances unless I individually consent. An ""air of consent"" is irrelevant unless I consent.

One could argue that you consented by participating in the bacchanal.

&gt;Perhaps your work-related events are not places where you get drunk, but I assure you mine are. I work for a very ""work hard, play hard"" young tech company. Asking whether this ""air of consent"" issue would extend into a work event where people are drinking to excess is certainly a very reasonable question for me to ask - there is drinking, dancing, loud music, etc...

Fair enough, if your work functions are indistinguishable from frat parties, then they should probably be treated as frat parties. However, you must admit that work functions are typically not at all like frat parties, and it's not reasonable for you to assume that everyone knows you work at some outlier company.

&gt;I'm asking what a reasonable precaution would be - if I don't want to be groped by a drunk coworker, do I skip these parties?

Yes. If you don't want to be groped by drunken strangers, don't attend bacchanals.

It's remarkably simple.

&gt;Assuming an ""air of consent"" sets up a situation in which people are going to be violated. Why support an argument that sets people up for sexual assault, even if they are in the small minority?

Hey, you're the one defending the existence of rape culture and women's participation in it. Not me. If you don't want to have wild, out of control sex with relative strangers, then it's reasonable simple to avoid the one activity that people have been engaging in throughout history to facilitate exactly that. Think about that. Only in the last...ten, twenty years has anyone even begun to suggest that there is a purpose to drunken bacchanals other than facilitating sex.

Have you ever considered the possibility that those people are simply stupid? That they just fundamentally don't understand what alcohol does?

&gt;Also... That last bit still reads as kind of rude - ""If you make this argument I will conclude you are a moron,"" is not terribly productive.

If your argument relies on playing dumb -- for example, refusing to recognize the clear differences between drunken bacchanals and social drinking -- then don't be entirely surprised when people conclude that either you are dumb or you think others are dumb.

You know very well that these questions:
&gt;Should I never leave my house? Should I have mace with me every time I go near a bar or restaurant that serves alcohol? Should I quit my job in the tech industry because, as a woman, I'm going to be in the minority at work-related events where there is alcohol?

Are not serious questions.  You ask these questions rhetorically, but you ignore the clear implication of the questions.  Do you really not understand the difference between having a glass of wine at a family gathering and going to a kegger?  Because that is what is implied by your line of questioning, that these extremely different situations are somehow difficult to distinguish from each other.

I think you do understand the differences, and that the lines are nowhere near as confused and blurry as you make them out to be.  Which is why I would frame this argument of yours as an argument predicated in stupidity.  It seems to me that only a very, very stupid person could possibly be *genuinely* confused by the differences between attending bacchanals and *leaving their home*.

Are you a very stupid person?  I assume not.  Then why ask a question that is so clearly ridiculous, even rhetorically?  I can only assume it's because you think *the rest of us* are drooling morons who won't be able to see such facile questions for what they are.

Before you report me *again*, let me make clear:  I don't mean to imply that I think you are stupid in any way.  What I mean to imply is that it seems very clear that you think *the rest of us* are stupid."

For me it was a chronic rotator cuff injury. Added onto that, my muscles around and under the shoulder blades were notably weak because my traps and delt were being recruited in exercises they weren't supposed to be, or compensating for weakness in the injured muscles (rotator cuff and shoulder blades). PT gave me a few exercises and I kept watch on the shoulder and associated muscles from there.

&gt;&gt;You are a non-shy introvert.

Agreed. Going a little further, you probably find thoughts in your head to be more interesting than the people around you.

&gt;&gt;Fortunately, I am not much interested in sex and/or romance, so I don't find my introversion a burden.

&gt;Lucky for you.

Again, see the comment above

&gt;&gt;But if you plan to actually get a girlfriend, please forget about ""just being yourself and love will find you"": it does not happen if you are an introvert man.

&gt;Not exactly true.

&gt;Yes you need to put yourself out there, but you can totally be yourself. It's all about finding the right venue and learning how to approach and present yourself as yourself.

I have found that people don't mind boring people. It is the attitude that makes a person boring that causes all the trouble. 

What attitude you ask? The attitude that makes you not talk to someone because you feel everything that you want to say is pretty obvious and there is no point in saying it. 

Make a habit of talking about the most mundane and pointless things. Learn to be a good story teller, and learn how to turn forgetting your car keys into an entertaining 5 min story. You'll get over the idea that your thoughts are more interesting than the people around you, and you'll stop being the silent guy."

&gt;Anyway, I wondered where in the UK you have settled

Mostly London but also Slough.

&gt;have visited other parts of the UK - in particular the Lake District?

Of course I saw other places! Some only through driving job (like Scotland - I will definitely go there one day to see it properly!). Lake District not yet either. I just need more free time (and of course saved money) for it.

&gt;Also have you had any difficulty understanding the broad range of English accents - i.e. geordie, scouse, cockney, brummie and so on?

Oh yes! You should also add accents of foreigners (like call centres in India). I remember once calling to ask something in a company based in Scotland (it was actually a Council). Main reception - understood without problems. Reception at the department (garage exactly) - a bit of an issue. And then they connected me with someone working there at the garage. Gosh, that was real hard - but I managed.

I have a family in Poland south (they live around place where accent is ""Goralski""). One uncle there was talking something to me (when I was visiting him being a kid-teenager). He said something and I couldn't understand it. I asked to repeat and he did, exactly in the same way as before. I asked again and the same situation. Then I just decided to nod having no clue what he was saying to me.

When I was coming to UK I thought all will be talking with Queen's accent. Oh how was I wrong ;) Anyway, I think in time you can get used to different accents. You just need to listen to them (if there is an opportunity obviously)."

The changes are to try to get more people to go through the apprenticeship program rather than the module system.  I don't think it will work the way they expect, but when has the government ever listened to the people on the ground?

They're eliminating the 'A' level designation and replacing it with an exotic metals specialization endorsement. Level B and C and the non-stainless/aluminum aspects of level A will be rolled into 3 levels, Level 1&amp;2 will be basically 'C' and level three will be 'B' Pressure and unlimited thickness welding certs.

The elimination of the A level designation isn't such a bad thing, for a 2 month course that covers things that most people won't really need, and if you do, it's only 2 months, so you should be able to get it fairly easily if needed.

Pokémon Typing Challenge was the most interesting find. When I was studying abroad in Germany this summer, I found it in the clearance aisle at a heavily reduced price.

With my nephew they put numbing cream on, then somehow attached/clamped a plastic tube that cuts off circulation to the foreskin, and it basically falls off after a week or so. Pretty much the same thing they do with the umbilical cord/belly button. 

Responding to the original question, I am, as are my brothers. I don't think it's particularly better or worse than not having it done, just different.

If I wanted to stratify Mercs and Minions based on the various sub-lists I'd probably put Highborn on the same level as Cygnar and Pigs on the same level as Skorne and Cyriss, with Gators dead last. Of course this is all heavily influenced by what I see locally, and many people will reply differently.

GeoffreyArnold,short,1388691152.0,"&gt; People will still have reasons to not like you. Just because you HAPPEN to be short on top being a massive douche doesn't mean the reason why people wouldn't like you is because of ""heightism"". That's what you do. You blame ""heightism"" 

Nice strawman.  I'm not sure why you're trying to make this topic about me, but it's not about me.  It's a discussion about a social problem which would exist even if I hadn't been born.  

&gt;That's what you do. You blame ""heightism"" 

I blame what on heightism?
&gt;You act all high and mighty like you're trying to educate the masses on ""heightism"" and make us short people feel better like everybody is perfect and would be loved/fucked/given a promotion if only ""heightism"" didn't exist. 

I didn't mean to imply that everyone would be ""loved, fucked, and promoted"" if there were no heightism.  But what I do mean to say is that it would be one less form of irrational prejudice in the world.  It would allow more people to live their lives fully; without an external prejudice which limits opportunity.  People strive against adversity everyday.  Sometimes, it even makes people stronger than they would have been otherwise.  But that doesn't mean that we should tolerate or foster widespread irrational social prejudices.  

&gt;Your wanna try and act like you're doing something to ""educate"" people about ""heightism""? Get your ass off of r/short and go over to r/tall (YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE) and complain about ""heightism"" over there.

Actually no.  The people who need to hear this most is short people.  Many short people are resigned to the idea that nothing can be changed.  And others still see themselves as naturally inferior.  Normally, those people simply rationalize it as ""one flaw"" that can be ignored or balanced out by other factors.  Not even realizing that it's an irrational prejudice which should be directly addressed and not ignored and allowed to fester.  

Also, why are you so upset about this topic?

Trepanated,vim,1388691166.0,"tl;dr:  learn Text Objects, then learn commands that can operate on them, then learn how to create new ones.  Then you will be One with your editor.

I think the way vim tends to be taught is okay for people who will rarely use it, and never very seriously, but need to know how to edit the occasional config file or something.  From what I've seen, people like to teach it bottom up, that is, starting with basic commands and motions in isolation.  I've been using vim (or vi before it) for something like 20 years, so maybe I'm out of touch on this, but I don't think that's a good way to teach someone who will need to make serious use of an editor, and is willing to invest some time in vim to give it a shot at being that editor.  It makes learning seem slow.  Too case by case.  ""Great, so you're telling me there's a nifty motion that would make me more efficient by 2 keystrokes in this super specific situation.  But is it really worth the trouble to spend hours, days and years learning all these motions for all these different cases?""

For serious users, I think the right place to begin is with Text Objects.  Capitalized, because they are Very Important.  If you don't understand Text Objects, you don't understand vim.  So what are they?  For introduction purposes, it will suffice to say they are just blocks of text with a starting point and an ending point.  When you think about it, you spend a lot of time operating on blocks of text with some semantic meaning.  Sentences.  Stuff inside quotes, or parentheses.  Arguments to functions.  Blocks of code.  Files.  vim provides stock access to a lot of these Text Objects, and plugins provide a lot more.

Crucially, commands operate on Text Objects, so when you learn a new one, you don't just learn one thing you can do to it, you instantly know how to run any command you already understand on that Text Object.  That's powerful.

But what if you need to operate on a block of text, and no Text Object exists to select it?  No problem; motions create dynamic, anonymous Text Objects for you to use.

""Dynamic what now?"", I hear you ask.  Recall that we defined a Text Object as a block of text with a starting and ending point.  When you use a motion, conceive of that as an operation that is creating a dynamic Text Object that is delimited by the starting and ending cursor positions.  As a side effect, the cursor is also moved.  Sometimes the side effect is all you want, and that's fine.  But where motions really shine is when you want to do something to a block of text, and can find a motion to move from one end of that block to another.  That motion creates a dynamic Text Object for you, and just like any static Text Object you already know about, it can be used with any command.  Ever lose track of the difference between typing ""diw"" and ""dw""? Well, in this paradigm you can see that ""diw"" is using vim's stock Text Object of a word to find the starting and ending points for you to delete.  Whereas ""dw"" is using a motion to define your own text object to delete, one that begins at the cursor's current location and ends with the place the ""w"" motion moves it to.  And if you understand that, then you automatically know the difference between ""ciw"" and ""cw"".  Etc.

*That*, IMO, is the real motivation for learning all those different motions.  It's the ability to create your own Text Objects with them, and then use them with any command you know.  A motion is not just a shortcut for getting from one part of a buffer to another, it's a way of defining the text you want to work with.  So when you learn a new one, you aren't just getting a slightly more efficient way of moving, you are getting a more precise way to map your editor's workflow to your own workflow.

And that is how I think people who are new to vim but plan to edit a lot of text should think about vim as they learn."

itsmevichet,seduction,1388691183.0,"Let's make a clear distinction here:

A woman ALWAYS chooses the man she's more attracted to. Always.

That said, sometimes, for one or many of a million reasons, a woman is attracted to an asshat who treats her like dog shit. In my experience, the only women I've ever seen do this had a whole list of qualities that were very unattractive to me after discovering them. But, that's neither here nor there.

The bottom line is that when a woman leaves you, she left because she's not attracted enough to stay. Period. End of story.

So, the moral of it all from my perspective is not to be butthurt and try to rationalize a woman emotionally choosing someone else over you. It happens sometimes, and the only thing that should happen when it does is you asking yourself ""how can I be improving my game?""

If your answer to that is ""become a woman beater,"" then I don't think dating advice is what you need.

Get out of the ""rescue the damsel"" mindset. Get into the ""become the prize"" mindset. Focus on you and your game, not any singular woman's choices."

There will always be a bad apple! I'm however quite convinced that most of them are just normal people who do want to integrate.

It's also important to try to describe what integration really means and after how many checked points you can say someone integrated fully or only partially. Language is a must here, if someone isn't keen on learning it, he will have difficulties all the time - meaning most of people do learn English if they don't know it already.

When compared to previous migration of Poles (after II WW) it was different then. Poles didn't have much choice (what, going back to Poland, to live in a communistic state or even be put straight to prison for being a soldier?) so they had to integrate as quickly as possible. Now with EU people may think they will come here for few months or years, won't fully integrate as there is no sense as they will go back (or move somewhere else). After all, even learning a language is a time consuming and not an easy thing (especially for older people)."

I didn't call you any names at all, and I'm being completely respectful, so I really don't understand your complaint here.  All I'm saying is that if you want to split hairs and mince words, I've got better things to do.

Partying means drinking, which leads to drunknesses.  That's clearly what we're talking about.  If you want to argue that the OP said X, and that X doesn't technically mean Y, it only generally implies Y, then yay for you, but I find such pedantic arguments over semantics pointless and frustrating when the meaning is so abundantly clear from context.

&gt;Women don't go to parties with the expectation of being raped.

Most women go to parties with the expectation of having drunken sex with quasi-strangers.  And sometimes they go with entirely different, oddly confused expectations, and end up having drunken sex with quasi-strangers and we call that rape (now, we never did in the past).

The question is, essentially, how much sympathy should we have for women who attend bacchanals for purposes other than bacchanalia, when they get swept up in the bacchanalia and are traumatized by the experience.  As you might guess from my general tone, I have little sympathy for them.

&gt;That is relatively small minority of women who go to parties. 

No, I don't think so.  That's the primary purpose of bacchanals.  I don't think many women are actually confused on that point.  If they are, then perhaps that gross ignorance on the part of women is what we should address.

&gt;Rape =/= orgy. And on that same topic, male on female rape is not a ""common part"" of it either.

A gangrape with consent is an orgy.  Heterosexual hook-ups are exceedingly common at bacchanals.  A rape, in this context, is only heterosexual sex without consent."

If you don't believe me, leave some French fries out for a few days.  They don't really rot as much as mummify. 

A little bit is fine.  If you put a little butter and parmesan on your broccoli and put your leftovers in the pile, that's not a problem. It will just go slower than steamed broccoli.   It's only going to be a problem if you are consistently dumping a lot of greasy foods, or emptying your deep fryer in the pile.

Holding people accountable for what they say is always a good thing, regardless if what they're saying is bad. Even deluded, frothing MRA-haters should be able to see that.

[It doesn't, actually.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism)

&gt;Capitalism is an economic system in which trade, industry and the means of production are controlled by private owners with the goal of making profits in a market economy.

That's what capitalism means. Regulation of any of these aspects doesn't make it magically not capitalism.

I get that *you personally* would prefer a free market without government intervention, but you don't get to just claim that any manifestation of capitalism you don't like isn't *really* capitalism.

wittyb,electronic_cigarette,1388691732.0,"You're on the right track, and if your brother sends you a mod (base) that has variable voltage and/or variable wattage (VV/VW), I think you'd be a whole lot closer to where you want to be.  But even if it's a basic eGo type clone, there are ways to help that out.  Buy a different delivery system.  The Kanger ProTank 2 puts out a good sized tasty cloud on just about anything, and there are thousands of videos about it.  The Vivi Nova or Mini Nova are totally respectable, and have almost 0 leaking issues.  Both are entry level, where you can go into (almost) any store and buy supplies for them, or you can get into rebuilding them to suit you...  The Nova's have plastic tanks, though, which will limit your flavor choices later on.

To get this right, when you say ""eGo starter kit"" did you have to push a button to get it to produce vapor, or did you just inhale?  Button == eGo (or clone), no button == cigalike, which pretty much have a proven track record of failure because of their poor vapor production which leads to weak flavor.

Now, so far as finding a flavor that works for you, that's gonna be a personal journey.  I know that sucks as an answer, but everybody's palate is completely different and there is no one size fits all answer.  Try finding a brick and mortar [store](http://vaporsearchusa.com/index01.html) near you.  If you can't find anything by that link, there are lots of vendors who have their data up on google maps, yelp, etc... edit:  I say find a B&amp;M, because you can usually walk in and taste test a gamut of flavors and walk out with the one or two that you like.  Even if there's nothing you like, most B&amp;M guys are open enough to provide you with recommendations that they've heard are good from the web.

Another issue for taste, is the resistance of your coil/atomizer.  If you want a heavier taste on a one-button eGo, head for a lower resistance.  Be looking into the 1.5-2.0 ohm range.  That will heat the liquid faster/hotter and give you more flavor.  Most tanks come stock with a 2.5-3.0 ohm coil.

With the exception of medical bills, all of the other things you listed are exactly the type of ""poor (financial) life choices"" that put the person in the situation they are in.  Why did they invest poorly (which means they invested ignorantly) and lose a majority of their nest egg?  Why did they choose to get divored (or married to the wrong person in the first place)?  Why did they spend beyond their means and go into debt?  Why did they support another family member before preparing their own life first?  Even medical bills... in many cases (certainly not all), why did they choose to carry insufficient insurance?

That isn't to say anyone who did those things is a ""bad person"".  But the situation they are in is certainly more a result of *their* choices, rather than society's choices.  So while I agree that society should be willing to help out on a limited basis (as I said previously, I'm not in favor of letting people die in the streets), the person who made the decisions that got themselves in a bad financial situation, should be doing everything possible (living with family, using public transit, etc. etc.) to minimize their burdern on society."

NDaveT,DebateAnAtheist,1388691874.0,"&gt; Except for things like freedom, government, justice, love? ...if you have a scientific proof of the existence of a concept such as ""justice"" or ""love"", bring it forth. And let me assure you, love exists. 

Yes, and we can demonstrate it exists using the scientific method.

Freedom, government, and justice are all human constructs, but once we've defined what we mean by them we can use the scientific method to determine if they exist in a certain situation.

Note, however, that God is supposedly **not** a human construct. It's something that, if it exists, exists regardless of whether human beings do or not (unlike freedom and justice). That's why the scientific method is the only method that is applicable to determining if it exists.

&gt; Which I took as ""is a religious belief necessarily at odds with current scientific knowledge""

And the answer is ""yes"" because there is no scientific evidence for any gods.

&gt; Because we(humans) all use other epistemic methods for other aspects of our life (life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness). This includes all atheists and theists alike. None of us uses solely the scientific method as our sole epistemic method. 

But for the question of whether something exists - like a god - we use the scientific method. Some people do use other methods for those questions, and they get wrong answers.

&gt; What argument do I have to tell someone who wishes to hold theistic beliefs, not based on rational evidence, but based on personal choices? (a clear case here is pantheist and associated ilk). 

Your argument would be that it's irrational to use personal choices to determine whether something exists. 

&gt; So the question for me is, if someone holds a religious belief, not at odds with current scientific knowledge, how is it different from the other beliefs we (atheists) hold based on these ""other epistemic methods"".

I don't know about you, but the only beliefs I hold on whether things exist are based on the scientific method. If they weren't, I would be a fool.

shankrabbit,glutenfree,1388691899.0,"Maybe I'm just getting stuck on the semantics here. Your join pain is not *caused* by gluten. It, in itself, is not that reason that your joints hurt you. 

Your joints hurt due to a number of medical reasons, RH being the most common with SCI. I'm fully aware that gluten CAN exacerbate the problem due to the built in auto-immunological failure response your body is already taking on your joints with the messed up TReg cells. However people, not just you, need to know what the *actual* cause is *before* removing gluten from their diet. 

Removing gluten from a diet should be a medical need, not a cure. Even with celiac disease... there is no cure... just a medical need to remove it.

The reason I get so up in arms about this issue is because if people attribute gluten to the *cause* of the disease or the disease itself, then they very well could be masking a much larger issue. RH, for example, also leads to high risk in cardio vascular issues - which I assure you, no amount of reducing gluten will help with.

Like I've said this entire thread, if people want to hit a GF diet just to be on the diet, awesome! I'll try and help out wherever I can. But when people hit a GF diet to pray they find a miracle cure for their pain, I get worried... because without a medical mandate from a doctor who knows what the cause of pain is, someone could be masking a larger issue that needs addressing.

There are no more fast corners, and surely Williams bears some of the blame if their steering column broke, and the FIA bears some for banning the electronic aids the car was meant to rely on. After that, we got back to making progress in car speed for another 10 years.

Then they started trying to change F1 to appeal to the people who didn't like what it was about: the fastest cars on earth. They made the engine smaller and started the quest to become a NASCAR-like pass-fest (never mind if the passes are completely meaningless). They also tried to go green for the people who hated it, and who still aren't going to like it even though we've gone from V10s to V6s.. 

Anyway you're kidding yourself if you think these changes have made it death-proof. Massa almost died in spite of it all. Alonso could have died in turn 1 at Spa last year if he'd been more unlucky.

For instance, in 2070, the game will focus on a strategy based on building for one to three factions that build differently and will often have attributes that can augment other factions that you have chosen to play with (e.g. Researchers can give another faction upgrades for their settlements).  Environmental degradation plays a factor in that industry causes the modifier to reduce which causes agricultural output to also reduce.  One faction plays the environmentalist role (with lower industrial output) and another faction plays the opposite.

This is in contrast to earlier titles (Dawn of Discovery for instance) that focus on a single faction that can build different settlements based on the environment of the island, each of which produce different goods and work in a slightly different way.

Anno games can be great fun but require patience to get into.  Much of the game revolves around [puzzling together buildings into the smallest space possible](http://anno2070.wikia.com/wiki/Eco_Production_Layouts) (as all land is limited in the game) and the efficiency gained here is a key way to win the game for many players.  If you enjoy this type of puzzle, Anno games can be great fun.

On the flipside, if you're a gamer that enjoys a good economy in game and wants to focus on trade, the Anno series is light here in my opinion both in terms of the economy as well as the amount of time working with trade routes (it's really pretty set it and forget it).

If you don't know if this game will be right for you or not, $7.50 isn't a bad price to pay and you'll certainly get plenty out of it."

A server grade CPU is not meant to used for video games and word processing, it's made for creating games and making the word processor. There are other bits in a Xeon CPU that a i5 or i7 don't have that make it perform better when trying to calculate complex equations.

Look at your link again, and go to the 64-bit multi core tab... That's what I'm talking about. That kind of work flys on a Xeon. Consumer apps aren't always set up for a multi core 64-bit CPU but business app are."

Cykuta,AskReddit,1388692129.0,"I'm with you. A lot of things are ""natural"", for example pissing where you stand or killing off your grandpa because food is wasted on his old incapacitated ass.

While this is a classic straw argument (may also count as ""slippery slope"" I guess?), I think it works well to point out it's important to encourage control of basic urges in humans. After all, you want your baby to learn not to piss itself and all that stuff, right? So I think it should be able to wait half an hour for feeding, then. I certainly could as an infant, from what my Mum tells me. 

I understand that the public breastfeeding thing is supposed to save nursing mothers from being imprisoned in their own homes, and that's a worthy goal. But I think some sort of compromise is necessary, if only to avoid a reality where having a child exempts you from things like manners and consideration."

MyPoopIsHere,relationships,1388692143.0,"On the matter of divorce and kids, my poor daughter has seen me go through 2 of them, although the first she was about a year and a half old.

She has no memory of her mother and I together.  It's been 5 years and she and I have become friends and we co-parent very effectively.  This only works because both of us have put aside our personal differences for our daughter.

I remarried a little more than 2 years ago.  This ex had a daughter that was only 8 months older than my daughter.  We divorced in august of 2012 for reasons I won't go into.  This was harder on my daughter because she lost a sister, although she never really did take to my ex.  She still claims to miss both of them from time to time, but more so she misses having a sister.

The thing you need to understand is that even in a divorce where the assets are handled and the couple is very amicable, it can take time.  My first one took over a year and a half to complete and we had our assets split before we even went to the attorneys.  Your son is already 3.5.  He is likely already going to remember bits and pieces of this time, so I think you are probably too late on trying to minimize his impact based on his age.

I think you are going about this very practically, but at some point you will need to make a choice on whether you can and want to rebuild that trust with her.  This isn't a gray area.  It's black or white; either you trust her again or you never trust her.  A relationship without trust never works well.  

If the day comes that you decide you have had enough, make sure that you put your son first in all of your choices and yourself second.  You should be speaking to an attorney now, even if you are not sure if you want a divorce, simply to protect yourself.  Remember one very important fact of the world in which we live - When it comes to parental, reproductive, and marriage rights, women have the upper hand.  Even if you never end up pulling the trigger on the divorce, get an attorney now just to make sure that legally you are not making any missteps.

As for who to confide in, I would stick to the people you have been talking with for now, unless your couples therapist feels it is a good idea for you both to put her actions out into the open.  I can see validity both sides, but once you say something you can't unsay it, which is why I would keep it to just a few close friends and relatives for now.

One last thing.  remember, she is the one who stepped out on your marriage.  She needs to earn her way back in.  I would leave it to your therapist to determine what methodologies will suit you for rebuilding that trust.  Also, she should not be going to any more conferences for a long while.  That is where this whole thing started, and I am a firm believer in ""Don't be there"" - a philosophy where if you don't want something to happen, do not put yourself in a situation where it can happen."

OP is asking for us to change is fear of death, /u/rular is simply telling him that it is OK and natural to fear death.

In that regard, it is a very nice analogy. How do you keep missing the point of stuff so much?"

Suddenly I heard a deep, throaty, demon-like voice say ""Now I can finish what I started!"" And then I woke up entirely and could get up and move, to my greatest relief! 

Another time since then, the sleep paralysis started out the same with me waking up in my mind but not being able to open my eyes or move.

Just pure afk farming, which is unrealistic in a real game. The 100 in 10 was meant for last hitting practice in custom games where your only focus lies on the last hits. No enemies, no bots, just last hitting. 

If you're able to constantly get around 75-80 in the first ten minutes while trading/harassing the enemy you're on a very good way. 200 in 20 is a bit more realistic to reach, but still rarely accomplished.

Samen28,gaming,1388692691.0,"I'm surprised this hasn't been mentioned yet, but if you don't already own a solid PC, or just for when you inevitably need to upgrade, I highly recommend checking out /r/buildapc. It's a great sub!

Otherwise, if you want to transition over, it should be pretty smooth. Just keep in mind you'll largely be playing the same games / same kinds of games, they'll just look prettier. That said, there's a metric shitload of PC exclusive experiences you wont be able to get anywhere else, so have fun exploring that!

As far as ease of use goes, you can get a lot of mileage out of digital-distribution shops like Steam or GoG, but even in a fully integrated experience like Steam you'll never quite have as smooth of an experience as a dedicated gaming console. 

The good news on controllers is that 360 pads are natively supported by Windows, and other controllers are pretty easy to set up. However, it is up to the individual game how they choose to implement controller support, if at all, so don't expect games to just support it right out of the box! Steam tends to do a very good job of labeling which games do and do not support controllers, but even then some games still do it better than others. 

So, if you're looking for a pro / cons list, I'd say:

Pros:

Widest possible library

Potentially much performance compared to console (assuming a good computer)

Cons:

User experience will never be as simple, straightforward as console

Controller support is still somewhat uneven (though big budget action games tend to be a given). 

Cost is really debatable between console and PC, as with console you spend less on hardware but more on games (typically). Consoles also usually required some kind of paid online service outside like LIVE or PSN, which can add up over time. "

Not really, no. Sometimes it's possible to cancel the auto even AFTER the projectile has been fired. This one really is an experience thing.

Yes. Both the wind-up time and the cooldowns of your autoattack change with AS.

if a person feels i must pay tribute or respect to a non living entity and just a concept or idea (a flag) while people pledge allegience to it like some kind of god. i would rather you took offence than non offence.

expecting someone to respect your flag is offensive and unfriendly, anyone who thinks because i don't kowtow or bend to something that is not a part of me or a living person, can rightly be offended. and i hope they are.  

if we were in a bar and we drank to the queen, (not in her prescene) i wouldn't be offended or feel rude that you werent taking part, becuase it would be most improper to expect you to conform and ""worship"" or pay ""respect"" to something you didn't wish to.

Orsinium has existed on and off since the late Merethic Era; reports in the First treat it as if it were common knowledge and pre-existing. The first notable sack of the city took thirty years and resulted in the death of Gaiden Shinji, one of the most notable blademasters and the source of the quote ""The best techniques are passed on by the survivors."" Given that the Orcs a) killed him and b) have existed despite enduring constant harassment and high death tolls for millennia since then, I'd say he's absolutely correct. ^^Eat ^^me, ^^Yoku-lovers. Orsinium may or may not have been rebuilt every time in the exact same place (one should never underestimate Orcish stubbornness), but it has stayed in generally the same part of the Wrothgarian mountains since then in a continuous cycle of building and burning as the Bretons and Orcs fought back and forth. The only known ceasefire before the Fourth Era was during the Second Era's Interregnum, when the Trilliance War brought Orsinium into the Daggerfall Covenant. After the war ended, the cycle resumed. The events of *Daggerfall* culminated in the establishment of Orsinium as a permanent city and the Orcs as an Imperially-recognized people, but this didn't stop the Breton/Redguard alliance. Sometime around 4E40, as cataloged in the Keyes books, Orsinium was sacked one final time, and this one was reported to be truly devastating. The Legions escorted the Orcish survivors out of High Rock, and Nova Orsinium was established on the Hammerfell-Skyrim border, though exactly where was not stated. Given that two cities exist on the triple-point of Hammerfell/Skyrim/Cyrodiil, it is unlikely that the Orcs settled there, and the wide expanse in the mountains between Skyrim and Hammerfell offer a likely settlement between Markarth/Dragonstar and Falkreath/Elinhir. Furthermore, this location is close to the Stronghold of Dushnikh Yal, allowing for easy transportation from the new city to an established settlement.

Blacksheep01,AskReddit,1388693034.0,"You aren't grumpy today, this is how you really feel, don't hide it. I've felt like this most of my life. Even when I was in high school and didn't have a real job yet, I didn't want to have a day job that ate up all the activities I really enjoy doing, but that's what happened. I've found my way over to /r/futurology because of it, there we talk about a future in which automation replaces half or more of all human workers (its partially happening now) and people would then receive a basic incomes not to work, but that point in time is 30 - 100+ years out (depending on advancements).

I shouldn't complain, I have a great paying job that isn't stressful, but it takes up most of my day. I work full time in a professional career and am finishing up part time grad school (writing MA thesis now), so my days are work 9-5, drive home, cook, eat and relax for an hour. Now it's 7 p.m., work on thesis until midnight, watch TV for another hour or two, bed, repeat. I love the thesis actually, but I wish that were my day job for now instead of my actual job.

I also train in Olympic recurve archery, play the guitar, I've got two books I've been working on but have slowed to a crawl because of work + thesis. I have a stage play I want to write but don't have the time to start and I've let my art skills slip into non-existence (this really bothers me). I  build my own computers and servers and I enjoy woodworking (novice level), but I don't have the time to do most of this anymore, or with regularity. I just took a week off work over Christmas and built myself a new computer and server, caught up with family and friends, worked on my thesis, worked on my archery and researched plans for a new bedroom dresser I want to build alongside a ton of other activities that occupied my days from 1 p.m. until 4 a.m., every day (I have an screwed up circadian rhythm). I literally had no moments of boredom or down time and was so busy working on my projects that I had to force myself to sleep before sunrise every night. I loved every moment of it and hated going back to work more than usual. 

My wife recently got a better paying job than me and loves it, so I am starting to wonder if we could live just on her salary? I've really had it, I want work on the things I love, maybe make money off some of them, maybe not, but just do those things. This modern 9-5 working world is not for me, never has been, and I need to get out."

Now regarding if it's wrong or right to be in a clique. I believe that if a clique doesn't exclude, or bully anyone because they're different, then it's completely fine.

Zexks,feedthebeast,1388693117.0,"Yeah but a line has to be drawn when dealing with things that spawn in magically out of thin air. I think vanilla handled this pretty well, by limiting the number of spawns and making it player dependent. I would imagine they did this specifically to avoid the OP'ness invoked by SS v1. We can still make decently efficient farms in vanilla with this mechanic, but the big prize is in locating several spawners close enough that you can be in range of all of them. At the very least SS lets you compact that and set it up where ever you want.

Besides everyone has a 'crafting area' of their base where they spend a significant amount of time just standing around looking at GUI's and crafting things. If you just set up a spawning area above or below that area and leave it on, you'll get more than enough drops while you're doing other things. Since the only real commodity in minecraft is time, forcing a player to be in a specific area for a spawner to work is really the best way to impost a cost on the ability.

Don't get me wrong, I love that folks are moving here from all over the place: Seattle's a great fucking city, and I'm thankful that other folks appreciate it as well.

Cautiously_Curious,AskMen,1388693245.0,"This, along with it being easier to advise than to practice, appears to be why a lot of people find it easier to advise others than to find a solution for themselves."
JonnyRichter,Anarcho_Capitalism,1388693246.0,"The equilibrium is where the employee receives their marginal revenue product. This is something, of course, that would have to be measured from person to person, as even some customer service reps bring more revenue in than others. 

You're right, though. The calculation is certainly more complicated than the binary *having-a-job vs. not-having-a-job*, but somehow, this concept was picked up somewhere and has been the main talking point for the arguments for and against the minimum wage. But anyone who's received one lesson on price floors knows that inefficiencies are measured algebraically in *dollar amounts.* That's to say, there is less cash flowing in the transactions because of this. 

A perfect analogy would be a food purchase. Some foods cost more than others because those foods are more satisfying; they provide you more benefit. So if the government stepped in and said ""all food must be sold at *at least $5*, you wouldn't stop eating, right? Instead, you would stop buying food you valued at less than $5, which means that food would be purchased less. Some of the foods that are worth exactly, or a little more than, $5 would also increase in price, meaning you would be buying less food altogether. 

In this case, unskilled workers are the food worth less than $5. They find it harder to get a job that will employ them for as many hours as an employee who is worth more. "

Meanwhile, go to a mall and start cold approaching girls there. You really gotta get them to your town and see them outside your house if your parents aren't too open with that. "
RiverSong42,SingleParents,1388693251.0,"&gt;I have been a single parent since I was like six weeks pregnant (I guess I wasn't technically a parent then, but whatever).  I told my son's father that I couldn't go through with the abortion we had planned on and I kept our baby.  
I know that he didn't want the baby, and so **he isn't responsible for him at all...**

What? Sex makes babies. Even protected sex can make a baby. If he is having sex, it should be with the understanding that it can make a baby. He is responsible to help care for his child.

IAMTHEDEATHMACHINE,TheRedPill,1388693259.0,"I think you're confused about what the red pill means.

It doesn't mean that men are inherently better than women. The red pill is about accepting (and acting on) the *truths* that men and women are different physically, mentally, and emotionally.

You can respect women while being RP. You just can't agree with the retarded feminist notion that we're all the same and women can do everything men can.

I can't help you any further.

Read two books: *The Way of Men* by Jack Donovan and *Models* by Mark Manson.

The former is about masculinity and what ""being a man"" really means. In my opinion, this is one of the most important books ever written for me. It's red pill to a T. The latter is an excellent book by a pickup artist turned general life coach. Both will help give you some answers."

Also, why was the leap from 8 to 32 not that significant, but the leap to 64 is enormous? Is 64-bit handling from 0 - 2^64 ? That is a huge number, if so.

Why are higher order CPUs more expensive to manufacture and why are the results diminishing? It seems like they'd be logarithmic in their improvement?

lynn,Parenting,1388693623.0,"WTF, ADHD medication for introversion? That's ridiculous, and I'm an introvert with ADD (no hyperactivity).

How old is your son exactly? My daughter is 3 and very introverted, a bit shy, and rather protective of her personal space. Over the last year or so she's really come out of her shell, and I think it's the childcare at the YMCA that's had the biggest effect. I take her there 4-5 times a week for an hour and a half each time. When she started, she was really shy and only played by herself, but that could have been mostly because she was 2 and not developmentally ready. Now she still takes a minute or so to warm up but she's playing with other kids very quickly.

I'm the same way as she is, so I basically just do what I would have wanted adults to do for me. 

I encourage her to use her words, to say ""stop"" or ""no"" when she wants someone to stop touching her. I tell her this right in front of people when she's curling up as they're tickling her or otherwise touching her. We also require her to ask for things she wants -- we don't guess, usually, or give it to her when she won't ask but we know what it is that she wants.

I let her hang back if she wants and never force her to do anything she doesn't want to do, socially speaking (unless it's necessary, of course). I do push her a bit but if she really doesn't want to, I let it go. I don't make her hug anybody or anything like that.

IMO a lot of the problems associated with introversion are mostly due to pressuring them to act like extroverts. But it's easier to say ""let them be introverted"" than to identify the things we try and get kids to do that are traits of extroverts."

boolean_sledgehammer,AskMen,1388693661.0,"The person with the most power in a relationship is generally the one who needs the other the least.

Your partner wants to have sex with other people. This is otherwise known as a consequence of being alive. 

If you have to negotiate sex, then they don't want to fuck you.

You probably are never going to find someone who loves you the way you expect to be loved, and you are never going to recreate that unconditional love that you either did or did not experience from your parents.

Most of a person's core personality is set in stone. That being said, people do change. They don't always change for the better.

If you go into a relationship thinking of your partner as a fixer-upper, I can almost guarantee you it will fail.

A relationship should *never* define you.

If they cheated with you, they will probably cheat on you.

Paying attention to what they do will tell you more about a person than listening to what they say.

""Staying friends"" is usually a bad idea.

Your relationship should never be a barrier to your mission in life.

People will naturally take advantage of your time and effort. Act accordingly.

The only person on earth who can truly take care of your needs is *yourself.*

No, if I go to a fucking club, it's because it is a hugely fun bonding experience to go out and dance with my friends. I say no to guys who want to dance. Girls talk ALL THE TIME, it's about doing something fun and energizing and different. 

If they want to look pretty, and that happens to get them attention, what is the huge fucking problem?? As long as she isn't going home with some random club guy, the amount of attention she gets from others is a moot point.

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1388693772.0,"I want to clarify something here:

&gt;We also have receptors specifically for marijuana called endocannabinoid receptors.

This is a misconception. We have endocannabinoid receptors for *endocannabinoids*. Endo is a prefix short for *endogenous*, which means created within the body. Marijuana's exogenous cannabinoids can bind to these receptors, but the receptors are not meant ""specifically for marijuana""."

davebu,magicTCG,1388693773.0,"I would recommend not playing cards like unflinching courage because they force you to go all in (it is a fantastic sideboard card though).  That makes fabled hero weaker, and I would replace that with loxodon smiter.  I would also suggest dropping 1 land, 2 thunes, and the 2 hydras, as they may look like they will be awesome, but they are slow and clunky and are easily removed.  You can also remove call of the conclave.

I would go up to 4 mystics and 4 advents, and 2 scavenging ooze.

I would also drop 2 or 3 last breath into the deck, as master of waves is a huge problem, and having an out to a turn 2 pack rat is always good.

As for the sideboard itself, 3 mistcutter, 3 skylasher is a good package as you can use them against monoblue and control (60% of the meta!).  You can move the unflinching courage here to help you fight against aggro, and I also keep a plummet or two here so you can deal with stormbreath and desecration demon decks.  celestial flare is also a good option.

sitapixie1,AskWomen,1388693840.0,"I hate to echo everyone else but 24 is super young. If I was living my life now (currently 37 soon to 38) with how I thought I would be happy as at 24... I'd be pretty unhappy. I thought I'd be going out clubbing all the time and living the ""crazy single life"" with my girlfriends ala ""Sex and the City""

When I was a little younger than you are currently, I had a boyfriend of 2 years break up with me. I thought I'd never find anyone that could *stand* to be with me, that'd I'd be the crazy lady living alone, and that no one would ever want to be with me.  *queue the violin music*

At 24 (ish), I was living with my boyfriend who I married at 30. When I met him I would joke that he ruined everything because I was just starting to be happy, enjoying being single, and not caring if I was going to be ""forever alone"".

We are together (14 years and still counting) and we are now talking about taking trips around the country to see what we've missed from living in the same state for most of our lives and eventually start more international travel after that. The last two years we've started discovering neat areas in our state so we've decided to branch out a bit. :)

You may find someone in a few years that you decide is worth ""settling down with"". You may find out that you really don't want to be ""tied down"" with anyone and continue travelling in a few years. You might find someone who loves traveling and decides to go along with your travel plans. You never know. 

Growing up, one of my aunts lived alone for all most of her life  (she moved in later with my mom to help my mom be able to afford a house) and as far as I know didn't have a dating life at all. I would say she was quite happy with her choice. From her words: she had a job where she could travel around the state for (she loved exploring WA), she'd see her nieces and nephews almost every weekend or more (or less) if she wanted, she had tons of friends from work and outside of work, and she kept busy with her own projects. 

She may have been single and chose a bit of a solitary life (I can't say that for sure though since I was so much younger than her she didn't talk to me about her social life :) ) but I definitely couldn't describe her as alone. 

She had an extremely active and seemingly fulfilling life until she passed away from cancer 4 years ago. She was really awesome and was the one ""voice of reason"" example from all the messages I got (from famiily, friends, media, society,ect) that I wouldn't be happy if I didn't have a partner and the worst thing that could happen is to stay single all my life."
scottperezfox,AskNYC,1388693848.0,"My opinion is that you should not try to live in NYC from loans/savings alone. If you are able to reduced tuition, and work part-time for a generally scruffy existence, then it's another story. But to take monstrous loans against future earnings is dangerous. 

You could argue the general case about education being ""worth"" the cost. Generally, it still is, but the additional costs of NYC vs. the rest of the country do not add up under any math known to man. Everything is more expensive here, sometimes by as much as 100% (such as in the case of housing.) True, salaries are also higher, but unless you're working on Wall St., you won't find a financial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

Have you considered attending school in Michigan (or somewhere else) but spending summers and other breaks in NYC to try and meet people? I know that no matter what industry you're in, you don't have to be here every day. If you attend a few key conferences and some meetups, it will almost appear as if you live just around the corner.

**TL;DR** go to school somewhere else and ""commute"" for professional events."

This was necessary after we had a guy would would just revolve his whole game plan around Mike + Trike.

This allows for quicker combos without ruining the whole game. This way, the table has more chances to respond, and if they can't in that time, knowing the combo is about to happen again, then no one feels bad when you pick them off one by one."

Granted that Francis has to fight against an absolutely insane amount of inertia.  He's the head of a billion-member bigoted, misogynist, greedy and corrupt organization that isn't going to change overnight.  So we can't expect miracles from him.

While the pay is low, there is a good reason Chinese farmers are flooding into the cities for these low pay factory jobs. 

Yes, while it's a crap wage and living by our standards, it puts them on the first rung of economic development. It allows for economies to slowly develop as these workers have a newfound disposable budget. This leads to small changes, such as getting bikes which allow for further travel, and infrastructures for trade. Many of these nations are actually ASKING to have these sweatshops built because it's the only way they can start developing their economy. They need that money to come in. "

Third, and this is a bit unorthodox, but try marijuana. The reason there's no mainstream Viagra for women is that there is already pot. It will help you relax both physically and mentally, and may be able to break the cycle in which it hurts, so you tense up, so it hurts more, so you tense more, etc.

As others have mentioned, and I'll echo / elaborate:

If you are a remote worker for a company, coworking spaces provide structure to your day and remove distractions.

I work from home, but my employer is based out of CA, MD and a few international locations.

Although I have a spare room dedicated to my work, some days are still difficult.  When my cats are feeling particularly needy, or there's work being done outside (I'm right next to an alley by a Walgreens, awesome!), or when I just need a change of scenery from my home because I'm here ALL. THE. TIME. - a coworking space has an appeal.

There's also the issue of the lack of structure that working from home brings. Some can deal with it, some can't.

It's really weird having no ""flow"" to your day.  You wake up, you go into the other room and do work, you take breaks - and those breaks take place in your home... then you're ""done with work"" but where do you go?  The other room. Nothing changes.

It's weird, and it takes more getting used to than you might think.

Some people just can't hack it at all, and are not suited to working from home."

JustWordsInYourHead,relationships,1388694315.0,"Here's your 8-steps program:

Step 1: Get an annulment if possible. Divorce if annulment is not possible. 

Step 2: Discuss with him how you will transfer the money back to him. Make sure he foots the bill for any administrative fees for money transfers. 

Step 3: Stay where you are for a few months, around family, to finish your studies and save up your own money for the inter-State move that you are planning. Brush up on IT skills if you're already out of school. I'm in the IT field as well, new shit is always coming out so we never really stop learning. 

Step 4: Spend time researching IT companies that you would want to work at. There's a pretty awesome IT company in Austin, Texas that I've had my eye on for a while. Silicon Valley isn't really our only option anymore. 

Step 5: Once you have a few places you want to go, research internships and employment opportunities. Research the living costs and moving expenses of each of these cities and get a general idea of how much $$ you will need to save before the move. 

Step 6: Save $$ for 6 to 8 months while you are getting all these items in order. If your estimated budget is $5000 and you didn't get to that mark, ask your family for a loan. 

Step 7: Apply to these internships and jobs before you make the move. Ensure that you've developed employer interest before actually making the move. Plan for having to fly over for face-to-face interviews (although more and more IT companies are doing Skype interviews now). Get a job lined up before actually uprooting yourself and moving. 

Step 8: Get movin! 

--------

Bonus Step: A couple of my IT friends actually work in small American towns. They get their contracts through the municipal government. Perhaps look into doing an internship in your local city government for an IT position?  "

Ostrololo,asoiaf,1388694431.0,"Unless a prophecy has a role to play *within* a series's universe, I consider it just a literary tool used by the writer to add some flourish to the series.

For example, the Red Wedding prophecy from the Ghost of High Heart serves no purpose from the point of view of the characters. Nobody tries to interpret it, nobody tries to stop it, nobody tries to exploit it. It's purpose is purely literary; it's a ""treat"" the writer put in the story for readers to go ""Ohhhhhhhh"" during a reread, or to foment ~~tinfoil~~ discussion among fans.

Meanwhile, something like the ""three betrayals will you know"" prophecy or Cersei's downfall prophecy actually affect the plot, since characters decide their actions based on knowledge of the prophecy.

The problem with mixing driver sizes is the way the amplifier will ""see"" the load.  Assuming cabinets of equal impedance and a connection in parallel, each cabinet will receive 1/2 the amplifier's output.  The individual drivers in the 410 will each only receive 1/8th of the power, while the single 15 will get the entire other half to itself.  With today's high powered amps, the 15 is maxed out pretty quick.

Which brings up the other issue.  Yes, displacement-wise, a 210 is a much better match to the 115 than a 410.  18's aren't used a whole lot anymore for bass amplification and I can't really speak to them.

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388694545.0,"&gt;It isn't exactly respectful to call someone ""willfully obtuse""

No, it's disrespectful to call someone *obtuse*, which is a synonym for stupid.  Telling someone you won't continue arguing with them if they insist on being *willfully obtuse* -- i.e. *playing* dumb so as to avoid acknowledging another's point -- is enitrely different.  I am simply saying that if you refuse to respect my intelligence, you can argue with yourself.  I for one am not being dragged into a pointless and pedantic argument over whether ""partying,"" ""drinking"" and ""getting drunk"" are meaningfully different from each other.

&gt;That is quite the claim.

Not really.  It's standard weekend behavior for tens of millions of young adults.

&gt; I've had many close female friends that like to go to parties often and not a single one go to each one looking for casual sex. Sometimes yes but certainly not the majority. In fact many of the girls I know have never had a casual hook up at a party despite going to them frequently.

Then your friends are kind of dumb, in my opinion.

&gt;Who calls consensual sex between two adults rape?

::headdesk::  Are you kidding me?  This is not hard to understand.

&gt;So woman going to parties but not wanting to have sex is a bad thing? I don't understand. So instead of telling men not to have sex with unconscious girls we are telling girls to just expect to get fucked if you go to a party, whether or not they want to?

Who said anything about *unconscious* girls?  

Most women who get raped while drunk are *not* unconscious, they just don't remember what happened.  Because there is a huge gulf between stone cold sober and passed out drunk, and in that merry land we call ""drunkeness,"" people act out on desires they normally inhibit.  Sometimes they wake up in the morning and decide they didn't mean to do all those things they did when they were drunk, and they call it rape.

What we should tell girls is that if you go and drink a bunch in mixed company, you may very well wake up in the morning not entirely sure what happened the night before.  And that calling a drunken hook-up that you regret ""rape"" is kind of bullshit, and that you should take some fucking responsibility for your own actions.

You know why there are so many unreported rapes?  Because a lot of these so-called ""victims"" who don't report, the ones that get swept up in all those statistics that so cleverly hide the truth, know that they are partially responsible for what happened, and know they can't *truthfully* say they didn't consent.  Because they were *hammered* at the time, and can barely remember what happened.

And women basically fall into two groups:  Women who understand that is the entire *point* of the bacchanal, and thus never get hurt (only occasionally embarrassed by their poor choices in partner while drunk); and women who pig-headedly refuse to acknowledge that alcohol has inhibition-reducing properties that have been well-known since Antiquity, and thus have the audacity to actually be surprised when they go to bacchanals and are (heavens forbid!) exposed to drunken, debauched behaviors.

I have zero sympathy for that second group.  "

noc007,AskReddit,1388694601.0,"Don't know if this is sleep paralysis or something else since I was already awake at the time and hadn't gone to sleep. I've had two other similar experiences that I still remember vividly, but I know I was asleep at the time so I'm only going to cover the times I was awake.

* The first instance I was 7 and at a time of my life that I was already a little freaked out at night and left the light on. As I laid in bed with my eyes open, unable to go to sleep yet again, this ""force"" overcame my whole body. From head to toe was a sensation that I could not describe any other way. I couldn't move most of my body. I could look with my eyes, move my mouth, and move my tongue to articulate words. However, when I tried to scream for help, I could only whisper.
Then the real freaky part happened. I was pulled backwards towards the wall. The covers stayed put, my whole body was moved, and my head got propped up against the wall. This is where I wanted to NOPE the fuck out. I tried to fight it and will myself to run. Instead it was more like an OOBE. It seemed like I could move with this ""force"" still encapsulating me and pulling me to the wall; I bolted from my bed towards my parents' door and when I opened it, I realized I was still in bed being pulled against the wall with my head propped up and partially out of the covers as before post move and hadn't actually escaped. This cycled a few times with the same result until it was gone and I could truly move. Obviously my parents chalked this up to me having a bad dream.

* The second occurrence when I was completely awake happened about five years later in a bed that wasn't mine (long story that I don't think is relevant). I wasn't feeling well and wanted to lay down for a little bit. I laid down to get comfy. After I settled it felt like a set of hands touched my shoulders. If it were real hands, I would have felt my pillow move. No, it touched me like nothing was in its way. It was a distinct eight fingers on the front and two thumbs on the back with palms. I promptly sat up half expecting to turn around and see something. When I looked there was only the pillow and the bed. I tried to dismiss it as nothing, but in the back of my mind I knew what was going to happen next. I laid back down.
Again, this ""force"" envelops my whole body. Again, the OOBE fleeing trickery happens. There was no pull as past times while I laid there, however as I OOBE'd my way out of the bed, I was being pulled to the floor. Each time I got out of bed, I was pulled to the floor to hinder my escape and when I made it out of the room to the hallway while stumbling to get there, I'd find myself back in bed unable to move or call for help. The pulling sensation wasn't a gravitational force. Pulling G's in a centrifuge or on a rollercoaster, I could always feel my skin trying to come off my face and feel my organs pulled in that direction. No, it felt like the enveloping force was pulling me to the ground, but I still stumbled as if the gravity had been turned up. After a few minutes it stopped and I GTFO.

I've felt this sensation before a couple of times as an adult and it stopped when I woke up. I've also had a couple of instances where I woke up paralyzed, but this ""force"" and terror wasn't present; eventually I could feel my body start accepting the commands my brain was sending and progressively regained movement. My mother tells me that she has had these frightening events all her life and they still occur a few times a year for her; she claims it's a demon my great grandmother antagonized with a Ouija board.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I don't see whatever is attacking me. It was an invisible force doing this."

doomrabbit,homeowners,1388694610.0,"I know wells better. The big thing to watch for there is how long between water coming on and the pump starting. If it's very soon, that means your pressure tank probably needs recharging. The pump should not be running for small uses of the tap, and it will burn out sooner if your pressure tank is under inflated.

To get an idea of what this is, the pressure tank contains a bladder (a ballon really)  which gets compressed in the tank by the pump's water. When tank pressure drops, the pump comes on to fix it. In a tank with a deflated bladder, the pump is forcing the water though the system and has to work longer and more often. 

TL;DR if pump comes on right after using the tap, you probably have a pressure tank issue."

If the alternator was bad, you wouldn't have made it five miles, however unless they checked the alternator with a new battery I don't understand how they could diagnose that. At my old dealership, it really frustrated me when they wouldn't let us install batteries as part of checking over the car, so they might just be covering their asses.

Your check engine light is probably on for P0420, so they are saying it needs a new Cat to meet emissions standards. But if it runs OK then deal with it later.

I think that the link I put in the other discussion has some of those (in terms of what newspaper editors and preachers were saying), but I think that the really important point is more of a ""so what?"" argument.

When you say something like ""fighting for their state,"" it more or less means that they felt a greater identification with one particular political unit as opposed to another. I'll suggest that the northerners may have felt similar, or at least had a significant degree of affiliation to the state level that's largely lost on us moderns. So, they thought that their political unit had the legitimate right to divorce itself from other political units, whereas the other side did not believe that to be the case. There are underlying constitutional questions to the war.

darthbarracuda,Christianity,1388694812.0,"No, I do not discredit the number 0 because it was invented by ancient Indians. The fact is that we see that number everywhere in math and science and it is a fundamental part of our understanding of the universe. Similarly, I do not discredit the Pythagorean Theorem just because it was found out a few thousand years ago. It works.

But those aren't claiming the existence of a supernatural deity. A god that wanted to have a solid relationship with humanity wouldn't go through an ancient book written by bronze age, tribal people. As I said before, it's asking for a disaster and many contradictions. He would have at least written it himself, sorta like the Koran. Allah apparently verbally spoke to Muhammad and the prophet wrote it all down. But the Koran is filled with inconsistencies and contradictions, which would make anyone question the validity of it since it is considered the actual word of god. 

Why do you believe in the Bible? And not the Torah, or the Koran? Those are also ancient texts, but you seem to disregard them and assume they are false.

No, I'm not saying the ""best way to get anything across would be just to shout constantly in everyone's ears about what to do."" I'm saying that if god decided, for whatever reason, to put his word into an ancient book, he could have at least made it a little less confusing, contradictory, and easier for people to understand. Followers shouldn't have to go to a bible study for hours to ""analyze"" the text, for everyone knows that analysis of text is subjective. It should be concise, ""set in stone"" (no pun intended), this is this, that is that, no questions or analysis required. It should be completely obvious that it is the word of god. And yet, the bible is not like that. 

Why would god have humanity write a book that is filled with barbarity and cruelty? You could say that I'm ""taking it out of context"" or that it was the culture of the time. But why would god only appeal to the ancient people? Why would he have modern-day people struggle with this? And if you do say that it was culture of the time...doesn't that sound like god was made up by the people since he matches their customs and traditions?

Why would god even put us in the universe in the first place? Was it to fulfill some sort of goal? Why didn't he just snap his metaphorical fingers and achieve that goal? Why did god create the universe? What purpose does it play? Is it that he wants a relationship with us? A relationship that is pretty much ""accept me into your heart or be tortured forever/annihilated?"" There's so many big questions that which the only answer is ""god works in mysterious ways."" It's a cop-out.

Yes, my life becomes infinitely more important when I realize there's no real point to life. That's the reality. I'm an existential nihilist. There is no inherent purpose to our existence. We are born, we live, we die. The universe goes on without care. But that doesn't mean I can't make my own purpose! I can still enjoy a milk shake, for if I couldn't I would be clinically depressed. Food/drink is good. Sleep is great. Later on, sex is awesome. It's a controlled hedonism. I wake up every morning with a purpose, determined to change the universe in some way, even if it is a small change.

Isn't it pretty amazing that we are simply the universe experiencing itself? Shouldn't we make the most of our limited existence? We are nothing more than water, a bunch of proteins, enzymes, and chemical reactions, but that doesn't mean I'm depressed about it. I don't need a god to give me a purpose. I don't need the comfort of an afterlife to keep me going. If there is an afterlife, why are you wearing a seat belt? Why do you look both ways before crossing the street? I wish to live my life in a way that pursues enjoyment and happiness while also helping my fellow humans enjoy their lives as well. I hope that when I die, I'll leave this world in a better place for our offspring, so that they can enjoy it as much as I will."

duffmanhb,worldnews,1388694926.0,"I was just talking about this yesterday. Some conspiracy theorist was trying to tell me something about the New World Order. His proof was that even the US government openly talked about forming a New World Order. Apparently like the US gov wanted to let everyone know that they are going to start secretly forming a satanic alliance. 

The reality is when they refer to the new world order, they mean it literally. Before the 1900s war was more of a game of chess, where the losers would basically respond to a loss with, ""Good fight my good man. You took that village from me now, but I'll be back to take it back some other time! You watch out good friend!"" Neutral nations were able to simply opt out of the game of glory and live their lives perfectly fine. 

Then it started changing in the early 1900s. Up until then, this new type of warfare was completely unique. No one really understood it, and many people were failing to transition into this new game. It was no longer a game of chess. The technology was now so advance, instead of taking over a fort you'd simply just blow it to hell. Warfare was now unbelievably brutal and chaotic. 

Then after Hitler's rise and demise, it was very clear how this new game of war works, and no one wants to play it. Now every state had the capacity to blow the crap out of the other guy's armies. 

So a new world order began to emerge. A world where warfare has lost all its glory. Where warfare was brutal and avoided at all costs. With this new order, all the powerful post war states outside of the iron curtain WANTED to the US to be a superpower. They WANTED us to have a massive military so we could keep the peace while they focused on improving their control. 

This order hasn't changed, nor does it look like it will happen any time soon. "

Say S&amp;D requires 12 wins to capture, you can get those 12 wins and get the CP points, and you can play another around to raise that number to 14 wins and make it harder for other clans to take it from you. You dont get any more CP, just helps hold it for you longer. If you have 10/12 wins, and playing with 4 people, you win, you will capture it with 12 wins and get the CP. You can play another match and win and it will go up to 14, but no higher. Its like added protection against it being taken from you.

I personally would hate if either subreddit became so policed that communications from the opposite sex weren't even considered. As long as it's only the appropriate gender voting on the communications, does it really matter who the text was written by? If a man says something that the vast majority of women agree with it, is that idea wrong because it was a man that expressed it?

I have a proposal that I believe could benefit both sides of this camp: similar to how AskReddit has a serious tag, why not have a gender-exclusive tag for threads in the gendered subreddits? That way the communities have more control over the content and all options are made available."

To control the axes you usually want to move towards the direction you want the axes to land, *before* the axe hits a target. You throw an axe and move towards the enemy. The axe will land in front of you. You throw an axe and move backwards, the axe will land behind you. You throw the axe and move to the left, the axe will land to your left and so on."

If I went the single-sling route then I would have him spec Archery and give him the mounted feats with his base feats.  Point Blank Master would definitely make Sling Flail irrelevant.

He can't use a longbow as he will be mounted.  From what I can tell the difference between a composite shortbow and sling is how expensive the ammunition is and the bows are 1d4 instead of 1d3, but sharpstones will have him dealing more dmg with the sling at early levels.

Please don't. You are confusing introversion with asociality. It is a myth that introverts hate people or that introverts hate interacting with people.

The pure introvert does like interaction with people, just not as much as any other person. We value interaction but we need alone-time as well because social interaction drains us, being alone recharges us. The same thing happens with extraverts, just the other way around. Being alone generally drains them while being in a large group of people buzzes them up and recharges them.

Of course, it is possible that introversy goes hand in hand with things like asocial behaviour, shyness or social anxiety. (This behaviour gets cultivated by the extravert world we live in. Whatever, rant rant rant.)

Sorry for ranting but I would like you to remember this forever. :)
introversion != social anxiety != shyness != asocial behaviour

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1388695420.0,"Guys, you have lots of chances to date a Polish girl. Plenty of them dated, dates and even married all types of foreigners while living here (typical white English man included!). I would say it's not the other way around (polish guys being with foreign girls) that often because of couple of reasons but I'm not sure if you want to hear them all as you asked other question.

How to charm? I'm the opposite of expert but probably beside obvious things which most girls like, regardless of their nationality (politeness, gentleman, clean, caring etc), there may be some extra things. Knowing some polish words and sentences is a good start! Being keen on hearing all things Poland and Polish related may help as well. If you were to learn to cook something Polish and then asked her for a dinner and presented some ""Golabki"" or similar I bet she at least would smile widely - as you have shown interest not only in her but also of her country and traditions. Obviously sometimes there may be exceptions and certain girls may not be impressed by things which many other would.

Things to remember - Poles in general are traditional and family people. Don't leave here all the time on her own just to meet with your mates. Do things together (especially if she is keen). Too much sitting in a pub and leaving her alone may kill any relationship (regardless nationality) but if someone values family it can be an even quicker killer.

While I don't disagree with your overall argument, I have to take issue with this statement.  Just because something is a bodily function doesn't mean you should do it in public.  I mean, I don't go to the park and cum furiously on the trees. We don't piss or shit in public either.  But I agree, breast feeding in public is fine and people should lighten up about it.  At the same time, it's hard to place blame on those people who grow up in a conservative culture that preaches about how bad it is to see a titty day in and day out and tells them to cover up everything or they're going to hell.  I mean, of course they're going to be uncomfortable seeing someone breastfeed.  Unfortunately these days everyone seems to think they have a right to not be uncomfortable or offended which is where the true problem lies.  If you're offended by public breast feeding then turn your darn head, don't make a fucking stink about it ya know?  I feel ya."

Amonette2012,funny,1388695676.0,"A guide to desknapping

In every boring job I've had, there has come a time when I really want to have a little snooze. Unfortunately in today's society, napping in the workplace is generally frowned upon, so you have to be a bit discreet. Some will go for a full-on floor nap, hoping to avoid discovery. Others may try the sitting on the loo leaning against the wall position, or loo nap, which tends to be chilly and punctuated by the sound of people using the facilities. There is also the simple but not to be overlooked wall lean, in which the would-be sleeper locates a wall they can put their chair next to and lean against in an upright position. This is best accompanied by a large document or spreadsheet that one can pretend they were perusing in order to avoid immediate detection. 

I feel pretty lucky in that I have an ideal desknapping situation. I have an office to myself, small though it may be, and can shut the door. This means that people tend to knock before coming in, which gives me that crucial seconds warning. I can hang my scarf from the coat hook behind my desk, providing a pillow that does not look at all pillow like and returns to it's default position of hanging innocently on the wall if my nap is disturbed (this affect can also be achieved in a subtle, wall leaning nap by looping the scarf around your neck, pulling up the ends and folding them to provide head cushioning, but you might have to pretend you have a cold or are trying to launch a new trend). 

The positioning of the nap is also very important. If you have a wall behind your desk, the chair back - feet up position can be adopted, which provides an unparalleled level of comfort that cannot be achieved by either the floor nap or the loo nap. This is further facilitated by the wearing of high heels, which allow you to lock your feet in place over the edge of the desk to avoid the 'chair sliding out from under you' situation that the leaning-back napper must take care to avoid. Nothing says 'that person is having a sneaky nap' like falling off a chair. 

So, chair back, feet locked, head cushioned, I am ready for my little visit to the land of nod. It should be noted, however, that the lean-back desknap is one of the hardest to disguise as a valid work time activity. It requires privacy and at least a seconds warning of imminent discovery. However, a non suspicious upright position can quickly be achieved as long as the chair is not tilted too far back - simply remove your feet from the edge of the desk and you will swing down into an upright position, thus avoiding detection and a bollocking. Practicing a wide awake and attentive look is also crucial to the 'no, I have not been desknapping' deception. 

If you are caught napping, be realistic. It is unlikely that you will be able to deny your unconsciousness. Instead, think of an inventive reason why you did not get enough sleep last night. My favourites include: 

‘I was up all night in casualty with a friend’, which has been true often enough that I don’t feel too guilty 

‘The hamster escaped and woke us up at 4am by trying to nest under the bed’, 

‘The fire alarm in our building has developed a fault and went off four times during the night 

‘Our neighbour has a very noisy new girlfriend’ 

‘I have a headache from staring at this screen for so long and wanted to rest my eyes and see if it went away’ 

‘I read that a 20 minute power nap leads to a 30% increase in afternoon productivity, and felt that it is my duty to the company to take steps to achieve this’ 

Crucial points to remember: 

Do not attempt to desknap when severely hung over. Unless you have a good two hours to yourself you will either feel worse when you wake up or fail to awaken in time, which can lead to discovery. 

Make sure you are nice and warm. Napping is no fun if it is too chilly. 

Sleeping under your desk is also an option, but watch out for those under desk dust balls. Looking as though you have been exploring the attic is not a good work look. 

Be careful with the angle of your chair tilt, as employment tribunals do not usually see falling off a chair while trying to have a sneaky forty winks as an industrial accident. 

Keep it under half an hour, there’s no sense in pushing your luck. 

Good luck, and happy desknapping! zzzzz "

YouSmellOfButterfly,confession,1388695919.0,"No, OP, it isn't black or white like this.

Congrats, you've been in a year long relationship. Now the excitement of being in love tend to wear off, and you begin to focus on the issues and suddenly you feel like you're not happy. You feeling less attracted to him, I think, is really just you becoming more comfortable with him. 

This may be able to be solved with communication, if done right. Maybe tell him you don't like his beard. Is it a full beard? Is he trying to grow it out? Does it look like pubes on his face? I think guys are always into their beards because it makes them feel manly... but unless they have a rockin' full luscious beard going on (which they always think they do), they need to shave. He might just need a wake up call. 

&gt;  He doesn't wash his face (doesn't have acne or anything but I find this kinda weird) and has dry skin and he doesn't take care of it.

Have you considered that he doesn't know how? Most men aren't exactly obsessed with skincare. He may be aware of his issues but feels like everything is overwhelming for him. If he's a redditor maybe stop by /r/skincareaddition ? If not, look at the links on the sidebar... maybe buy him some face wash and good cream?

&gt;rarely exercise or does anything active. I feel so shallow saying this but I think he would really amp up his appearance if he just worked out. He has such amazing handsome features and I think he would just look so great, hot even. Sexy...

This is the biggest issue for me here. You CANNOT want someone to change in a relationship (for your own gain), especially aesthetics wise. I know that sounds tough, because we all think things like ""man, if only my boyfriend did this..."" or whatever, but it is harmful. He won't ever change unless he wants to! With fitness, this is solved easily. Have you tried offering to go on walks with him? Go swimming, ice skating, running, biking, anything? Make it seem like a date. I get the impression your guy is skinny, and I've found that with skinny boys, they're afraid to get moving a little. I don't know why. Sometimes a little clever date outing might inspire him to keep going, or keep going with you.

&gt;He doesn't eat very healthy. he never ever eats vegitables or fruits or anything ""different"" or ""new"" and stays in the same routine for his whole life... This is what is making me feel unattracted to him, his lack of wanting to try new things and how he just acts offended when I suggest we eat healthier.

Sweet baby Jesus I know what you mean. I am a very adventurous person. I love trying new foods, cultures, things, etc. Stick me with someone who is afraid and I will go crazy in like, a week. Your boyfriend is comfortable where he is, and sees no desire to change that. My boyfriend is the same way, it drives me crazy sometimes. Again, that's what I signed up for by dating him! 

Have you brought up new things to do with him? Offered new foods, said you wanted to go to a Japanese restaurant or something? What does he say? Have you offered to take him to things he hasn't seen before?

It sounds like a lot of unnecessary work. But he has snuggled himself in the comfort of his lifestyle. You have to gently pull him into a warmer, snugglier blanket of exploring new things. This takes time. If he is stubborn, even longer, but it is very enriching for the both of you to learn something new together.

&gt; It has even gotten to a point where I am having a little bit of difficulty wanting to do sexual things to him. We share the same kinks and fetishes which is great but I actually often imagine and fantasize a somewhat different image of him in my mind :( 

This is the second largest issue I see here. All the things you have mentioned, can be solved by communication. TELL him you want to do new things, TELL him that you want him to shave his beard. You can't guarantee changes. After a while, if they don't change, it's best to leave. Sexually, things start to get touchy because everyone believes they are doing what's best for their partner. I wouldn't mention the whole ""I imagine a different version of you"" thing, but maybe the ""these things are leading to a lack of physical attraction"" and that may kick him in the butt to do something.

I know things are hard right now. Everyone on Reddit jumps quickly to ""BREAK UP!"" but imagine who the people on Reddit are. If they were in a happy loving relationship would they be sitting there telling you, based on two paragraphs, to break up? So just take everything you get here in stride, including me, should you see it that way. I've been in a relationship for 2 years now. It gets hard sometimes, that's what happens when you adopt another person into your life. But when you do solve these issues you will be reminded again WHY you're stuck around, and keep doing so.

Things almost always get better through communication. No matter how hard it is to say, you will feel such a lift off of your shoulders if you tell him the things you need to tell him. He may have some grievances with you, since maybe your feelings have leaked into other behavior he is noticing. So it will be best for you to just sit down and have a nice talk between you two.

duffmanhb,worldnews,1388695953.0,"Sure you can. Yes, it's far harder to follow the American dream as a poor uneducated person, but it's still very possible. The reason there is less of it is because American's no longer have that drive in them to work hard. Immigrants on the other hand, who are used to being entreprenuel, do come here and follow that dream all the time. They have that spirit and drive.

For example, if you want to become wealthy, all you need to do is teach yourself programming. After a good year of practicing in your spare time, you'll be good enough to get an entry level job making 50k. Which is a decent amount. In a few years you'll be able to have your own home, a car and so on... Then if you want the real bucks, start launching your own startups, and eventually you'll hit one out of the park which will set you for life.

Now, any one is capable of that path. Even poor inner city people. The problem is not that the American Dream is dead, the problem is no one wants to work harder chasing it. With all these advances in technology, all the resources you need are just a google search away. But American's all bitch because they can't have the house and car while they work at McDonalds.

michaelnoir,changemyview,1388695954.0,"Morality cannot come from authority. It has to come from reason. It has to be decided by the people most closely concerned in it and not from some arbitrary monarch or deity. 

What gives a deity the right to decide the rules for us? The usual answer is, because he created us. But, even granting that premise, it doesn't necessarily follow either that he has the right to dictate rules to us, or that we are obligated to follow them. 

Then there's the issue that the rules expressed in the Bible, and the somewhat arbitrary behaviour of the Judeo-Christian God described there, do not match our common standards of morality. 

Ethical rules are best kept to an absolute minimum. Luckily, there is a minimal ethical principle: The golden rule. 

I don't want to be murdered, raped, stolen from, or exploited, and I don't want my loved ones to be either. It logically follows that I should not murder, rape, steal from, or exploit others, since others are like myself. 

It really doesn't have to get any more complicated than that. 

There is disagreement about ethical questions, but there is also a broad moral consensus. It is we who decide this and not any outside deity or force, which would have no right to do so. 
This broad moral consensus is partly expressed, although imperfectly, in a secular system of laws and prisons.

katielady125,DoesAnybodyElse,1388696173.0,"I will do it on purpose sometimes. There are a lot of replies saying how it's unprofessional, a bad habit and it makes you look dumb. However, sometimes I like to pause and give the impression that I am thinking about my answer before I blurt it out. While I don't want to look dumb, I also don't like to ""Hermione"" everyone around me. 

If the person asking is embarrassed that they don't know the answer, it tends to make them feel less dumb if I appear to have to think about it too. It also helps in situations where I know the person asking really wants me to wrack my brain. (Like a customer asking if there is any way to do some impossible thing. 'ummm No, I really can't think of anything else I can do, sorry.') 

It is also useful in an environment where everyone is running around asking questions and making noise. ""Umm"" is a great way to let someone know ""Yes I heard you ask me a question and I'm trying to figure out how to phrase the answer or consider all the possibilities.""

 Yes if you are on a podium speaking about something you have studied for years and trying to look smart and professional, avoid the ""umm"". But it's such a common natural part of human speech that most people don't really notice or care unless you use it twice in every sentence you speak."

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388696183.0,"&gt;The other user has also now interpreted you as calling them--personally--""willfully obtuse.""

Well, yes.  That is the accusation.  It's exactly what they are doing.  They are being willfully obtuse in order to further an argument which has no actual merit.  It's exceptionally easy to never be proven wrong if you simply choose to play dumb and pretend that one cannot understand fairly simple speech.  You can force anyone with a countering opinion into an infinite regress of hair-splitting semantics over what words mean, if your only goal is to frustrate any dissenters into dropping their disagreement.  It's a shitty tactic if you have any actual respect for the people you're arguing with. 

The OP is clearly talking about women (or people) who choose to go out and drink and party, and the OC feigning confusion over what precisely the OP meant isn't productive or advancing the argument, it's just willfully ignoring the OP's clear intent to drag the argument down into pointless semantics.

If he wants to continue that line of argument, it's no insult to accuse him of being willfully obtuse.  *Especially* after the OP has gone to the effort of clarifying his point elsewhere numerous times.

&gt;This sub's purpose and goal is to provide a friendly place for people to get things off their mind, so we are a bit more restrictive than other subs when it comes to language. It's a trade-off to encourage people to bring both deeper-held views and more receptiveness to change them.

Okay, but all you're doing right now is encouraging people to be willfully obtuse.  If you can stymie any argument by playing dumb, and nobody can call you out on it without violating the rules, then you've essentially made being willfully obtuse a favored tactic for derailing solid arguments.

That's entirely counter-productive, because the only real purpose in being willfully obtuse is to protect one's opinion from attacks that might change one's view.  Thus, choosing to argue by being willfully obtuse, or using obfuscating stupidity, is in of itself rude and counter to the spirit of this forum.  Obfuscating stupidity is a tactic only used by people who are more concerned about defending a viewpoint than arriving at the truth, which is a poor attitude to have in a forum called ""change my view"" -- a place where, presumably, we are all open to having our views changed.."

* Resource conservation
* Security
* To allow other programs to have open ports

When a port is opened, that means that somewhere on the computer a program is listening. If a program is listening, then that means it is consuming resources, both via RAM and CPU time.

Secondly, there is a chance that an open port can be exploited. Back in the late 90's, there was something called an OOB attack that was directed to microsoft windows computers. That OOB attack forced windows to blue screen; all because of an open port and bad programming. Good times were had back then. :-)

Finally, if a program opened all the ports on the computer, then that would make it so other programs could not listen on a port (technical note: unless you did an IP per program). "

lendrick,AskReddit,1388696306.0,"&gt; I purposely breast fed my child in public.

Ya know, I think maybe there's some sort of middle ground in between giving people dirty looks for breastfeeding in public and making an effort to be as obvious about it as possible and plastering pictures of it all over facebook.  

It's not ""beautiful"" when I eat.  It's lunch.  If I do happen to be eating in a photo and somebody comes up and comments that it's ""beautiful"", well then, that's really creepy of them.

On the other hand, if I'm in a restaurant and somebody comes up to me and tells me they I shouldn't be eating, they can fuck off.

Babies need to eat too.  It doesn't need to mean any more than that.  When you're extremely and purposely overt about it, a lot of people who fully support your right to breastfeed in public are secretly rolling their eyes.  And just to be clear, I don't think anyone ought to feel obligated to be ""discreet"" about breastfeeding; rather, if you're *purposely* feeding your child in public, then the time your child waits in private so that it can eat in public is going to be a lot longer than the tiny bit of extra time it would take to get a blanket.

absinthevisions,TwoXChromosomes,1388696404.0,"I danced for 8 years and can honestly tell you yes it's possible. I worked with several girls who worked their way though law school, medical school, and other degrees. Most clubs are pretty flexible on scheduling but be up front and honest that you are in school and only have X hours/days to work a week.

However you should note that dancing is still a job. It can be a very fun job but it can be very physically and mentally taxing. You will be expected to dance, do acrobatics, and entertain all while wearing 7 inch heels and taking off your clothes. The majority of people that you will meet will be nice but you will run into people that aren't. Some people will be rude, mean, and degrading. You still have to smile and act like you are having the time of your life. If you can cope with that you're golden.

I've worked all over the US and have never had a major issue with safety. Just be smart and always be aware of your surroundings. You will be grabbed/touched at some point. Usually a firm ""No."" is all it takes. Most clubs have bouncers if anything gets out of line and to walk you to your car. Some even have you call the club when you get home.

Money depends on the area you are working in, the club you are working in, and how good you are at sales. It also depends on what you consider good money. You aren't going to get rich but you can live well. In most places as long as you're making at least $100 after fees and tip out you've done better than you would have at a normal hourly job.

Most clubs have a dress code. Most do not allow face coverings unless it's part of a special show. My advice is to wear a wig, maybe a good fake tattoo, and with the heavy make-up you'll need you likely won't look like yourself. 

I dated, was married, divorced, and dated more while I was dancing. It was never a huge deal.If it was I didn't see them anymore. Pretty much all of mine loved my job or were neutral about it.

You may want to check out stripperweb.com for more info. You may also want to consider becoming a cam girl (this is what I do now) as there is WAY more anonymity. I work with streamate.com and I'm making around $17 an hour and I only work during the day pretty much. If you have any questions feel free to let me know!

Diguiseppimon,AskReddit,1388696452.0,"Honestly, as grateful as I am to women of the past to fight for our rights to be equals and hold jobs, I spend a lot of my time fantasizing about being a housewife. Not barefoot and pregnant, but like, 50's housewife. I'd love to have my perfect little house, with my perfect little garden, and perfect little classic car sitting out front. I want nothing more than my boyfriend to walk through the front door in a nice suit, as I am wearing my twirly dress/apron/heels, pulling a pie out of the oven with dinner on the table. I love that idea. I know married life will probably never be like that, but on the nights when I am home, cooking dinner, cleaning, and he walks through the door, and appreciates all of that, it is such a great feeling. I'd love to do that every day if I weren't so damn tired from work all the time. 

That and, I remember my mom being so incredibly obsessed with redecorating our house, and me being young and bored after spending hours in the department store, helping her pick the perfect shade of green for the walls, looking at new countertops, etc. I find myself looking at houses a lot, and what I want, thinking about how I would decorate it on the inside.

Kaisharga,rpg,1388696456.0,"All people are born werewolves, in half-and-half form, and remain that way until between 7 and 12 years of age. This doesn't become a problem, usually, until their claws sharpen and their limb muscles develop (as well as their control over said muscles), at about 10 months, give or take. Teeth (fangs, really) come later, and the children then become a real and serious problem.

It wasn't always this way. Old people tell stories they heard from their grandparents, about cute, human-looking babies, who could begin to clumsily walk at about the same time as children become Howling Terrors now. Nobody knows what happened, but it has been this way for as long as anyone alive can remember.

Early on in a child's life, the parents care for their baby, doing everything they can to prepare the newborn to survive, and in some cases they try to instill the beginnings of a sense of justice and honor. Not many children take this to heart. When the child simply cannot be allowed near developed humans, it is sent away, though to where varies by the culture--some have large fenced-off areas, entire townships converted into roaming and hunting grounds for the young; others have multitudes of smaller prison-hostels managed by the toughest and most careful of hosts who take care of one to six children at a time; island nations have been known to designate an island or two in their archipelago as land for the prepubescent to run and live and fight and whatever other things they may do.

It's not certain what the children do out there, and nobody emerges from their adolescence with more than shredded remnants of memories, or a general feeling of camaraderie with a few others from the same ""nursery,"" if they live to return to society at all. But when their time comes to leave their wild selves behind, there is one last exhausting and painful transformation into the form we have always known as human. This is when they are most vulnerable, aside possibly from their early days before proper working fangs--other children may seize the opportunity to rip them to shreds if they have not properly socialized in their environment, while they are weakened and gripped by the pain.

If all goes well, the child emerges, ready for teenage years, physically fit and with social acumen, its parents' language absorbed and developed internally into a working, speakable form of communication, though the vocabulary at this point leaves something to be desired, and will rapidly increase over the next few years. The child will be expected to be a fully-functioning citizen of their nation by the time they are 18.

But all does not always go well. Childhood is brutal for some, and they can carry that forward as resentment into their adult lives, and lash out at others. These people do not often live past 30, as they feel too keenly the loss of their childhood physical prowess, leading frequently to depression--suicide is not uncommon for these poor souls.

Additionally, the containment facilities for children are not comprehensive, and imperfect where they do exist--""outbreaks"" of feral children into society are distressingly common. Local authorities the world over are trained by now in handling such events, but the strikes are so swift and ferocious that they are rarely without casualties. There is no shortage of stories of parents mauled by their very children, or older brothers torn apart by their younger siblings. "

Sir_Stumpleton,AskMen,1388696498.0,"'Steroids' seem to have become a blanket-term used to paint performance enhancing substances in a negative light. When it comes down to it though, Hormone Therapy is the use of steroids to improve the hormone profile of a hypogonadal humans to that of an average human being.

The difference between using steroids in medicine and in using steroids for performance enhancement in sport, is in the quantity in which is administered. Hormone Therapy works to raise testosterone levels to that of an average human being, performance enhancement works to elevate testosterone levels above and beyond those levels.

With that in mind, I think it very closed minded to outright reject the idea of using steroids, as their administration (if used correctly) could elevate OP's hormone levels to that of the average male. I won't explain all of the benefits of a normal hormone profile for someone with hypogonadism, but suffice to say OP would most certainly witness physical changes to his body, and maybe even emotional changes as a consequence.

Now my first response is not normally to suggest taking steroids, as they are illegal (possession/distribution/use depending on which country/state you're in), and require a fair amount of research to understand. However it appears that OP has reached dire straits, and ultimately a steroid cycle could improve his situation; with a large amount of research, OP could effectively re-create the hormone therapy which his doctor can offer, for a fraction of the price."

First, that Non Non Biyori did so well. It was great, awesome, relaxing, and an almost perfect show. I just didn't see it as the second best of the year. Elsewhere in the top-ten? Sure. But directly behind AoT? That's a crapton better than I expected.

Second, that Love Live! School Idol Project cracked the top-ten. It was probably just me, but I was extremely disappointed with that show. It was fine for the first half of the show but, just like C3-bu, the plot fell apart just as everything was getting interesting. But Love Live! made the list and C3-bu didn't.

Third was Arpeggio. I honestly didn't see the high attraction of this show. Then again, I probably wasn't in the target market for it.

ElderCunningham,explainlikeimfive,1388696591.0,"Area numbers - The first three numbers originally represented the state in which a person first applied for a social security card. Numbers started in the northeast and moved westward. This meant that people on the east coast had the lowest numbers and those on the west coast had the highest. Since 1972, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has assigned numbers and issued cards based on the ZIP code in the mailing address provided on the original application form. Since the applicant's mailing address doesn't have to be the same as his residence, his area number doesn't necessarily represent the state in which he resides. For many of us who received our SSNs as infants, the area number indicates the state we were born in. You can find out which area numbers go with each state here.

Group numbers - These two middle digits, which range from 01 through 99, are simply used to break all the SSNs with the same area number into smaller blocks to make administration easier. (The SSA says that, for administrative reasons, group numbers issued first consist of the odd numbers from 01 through 09, and then even numbers from 10 through 98, within each area number assigned to a state. After all the numbers in group 98 of a specific area have been issued, the even groups 02 through 08 are used, followed by odd groups 11 through 99.)

If you want a frugal alternative, buy a chemex and do pour over. It's a lot more time consuming, and having to manually manage water temp is a pain. But it's cheap, and makes great coffee. 

Spending $300 on a good grinder (baratza encore) and coffee maker can be frugal if it lets you enjoy coffee without having to spend money at coffee shops (and I don't mean Starbucks). I know mine have paid for themselves several times over. "

AnyelevNokova,TwoXChromosomes,1388696805.0,"One of my boyfriend's friends is like this. 

Ex-marine who got discharged early (he says it was ""thanks, Obama"", but other sources say there were ""issues"" involved.) He lives off his checks from the government and uses them to buy *lots* of weed. Has no interest in getting a job. Recently he broke up with his fiancee (reasons unspecified.) I know she told him that she wanted him to either go to school or at least get a job, because she's in a master's degree program with good prospects and, frankly, *he's a loser.* He *can* be a nice guy, but honestly, he often gets so wrapped up in his entitled bullshit that he revers to selfish asshole. So mess guess is she dumped him because he said he wouldn't get a job. He went on a rant while he was over here last which included the following sample gems:

- ""Nothing personal, but I think all women are hard-wired to snap. It's just a question of when. Like, if you have kids, it puts it off, but if you don't, then you go fucking crazy.""

- ""I hate women. What's the fucking point.""

- ""I think that's why sex feels good: it's the only reason men would tolerate being around women in the first place. We would have died out as a species otherwise.""

- ""It's not worth the grief: women are stupid. I'm going to wait for virtual reality wives to become a thing and just get me a programmed one; real women are too fucking worthless.""

- ""Feminism is woman's excuse to control and subvert men.""

- ""I like how women get mad if we hit on them, but they're the ones wearing skimpy clothes. Um, bitch, you're asking for it. If you don't want my attention, don't dress that way. It's unfair to put yourself out there like that and then get offended when you receive attention for it. Clearly you wanted the attention; otherwise you wouldn't wear it.""

He said *all of this* in a one-on-one conversation with me. I had done absolutely nothing to trigger this; this was all freely offered, albeit under the whole ""no offense"" and ""it's nothing personal"" disclaimers.

Honestly, at this point, we all just smile and nod like we do with some of our more hardcore conservative friends. Uh huh, sure, yep. *Oh, you're absolutely right, us women are just awful creatures. Yep. My only worth is for making you food and bringing you beer; how could I be so misguided? You're absolutely right.* I've learned that arguing with them only leads to more issues. So he sits there spitting off his sexist, entitled drivel, and we all smile and nod until he leaves. Once he does, there's a collective sigh of relief and there's usually a ""wow, really?"" conversation afterwards.

We laugh at his sexism. I could get offended by it, but honestly, it's not worth the effort. He's butthurt about women and has decided to take the low road; arguing with him will just feed him even more. Why should I waste my breath on someone that clearly doesn't want to listen? We could argue with him all day about how he's being a sexist pig, but that won't change his opinion. This is a person who isn't interested in being ""enlightened"", and attempting to do so will just backfire. So we just let him rant on and on until he realizes that he's the only one actually saying anything and awkwardly shuts up. If he starts saying crap that I just can't handle listening to, I excuse myself to the bathroom, try to change the subject (""SO, ABOUT THEM YANKEES"" is my go-to line), or find some chore that jolts me out of the conversation. Usually once one person jumps out of the conversation, the rest will follow."

She may not even fully be aware that her mind is processing that yet but the emotional confusion is still likely at work on her. I wouldn't be surprised if this festers until she can find some kind of closure to assure herself that he will return her level of honesty going forward. 

Also, the fact that he laughed when she was relating something that she was worried could destroy the relationship says something about how he may view her and how he feels about fidelity in general. He seems to be taking this much more lightly than he should. Just because the person she cheated with was a woman does not mean that the sex wasn't just as significant to her as if it had been a man. She likely feels hugely guilty and very concerned for their future and the fact that he does not return that level of concern is likely to be worrisome. 

Also, why did she not bring up her suspicions of his affair when she had them a year ago? It makes me wonder if he might be the type to turn things around on others when it doesn't suit him to be honest. Maybe she was even afraid to ask him about it. "

I'm very worried I won't be able to relate to an introverted child if I have one. It's been extremely difficult to learn to empathize with my husband's introversion over the years.

superior22,summonerschool,1388697133.0,"During laning when you can't kill the enemy right away you throw the axe at him and move backwards so you can catch it in safety. In fights you'll have to attack - move - attack - move. You should do that with every ADC but Draven is extra important on that one. When they're running away right click them for an attack, when the axe is thrown right click in front of you, click them for an attack, click in front of you etc. so you can keep running towards them without missing the axes.

The thing with Draven though, once a fight happens you have to commit to it. No one is able to deal more damage than you in an straight up auto attack trade. Be careful for supports with CC like Thresh, Nami etc. They can see where your axe will land and will probably try to catch you there. That's also the reason why you want the axe to land behind you unless you go all-in. 

Team fights are tricky and not one of Draven's strengths. It is said that team fights separate the good Draven players from the god like Draven players though. A good Draven will get a few axes out before he loses them, a godlike Draven will throw his axes, run towards the enemy and spam the laugh button. On a more serious note, in team fights you want to throw your axes out as much as possible but at the same time manage it so, that the axes always land behind one of your teammates. At first, that's just plain brutal to manage.

You'll need a lot of games just to become comfortable with the axe management. Once you've got it down though it doesn't look that hard anymore. And he's very rewarding. If you're fed, which happens quickly because of his passive, you can legitimately two shot squishy targets. That 10 - 0 Ahri with 2k HP? I took 1.4k of her HP with my first auto attack (crit). "

naughtysnake,PSBF,1388697183.0,"The whole point of the laser sight plus the ergo/ vertical grip is that they, combined, leave the weapon with a total of:

* -25% spread staying still (shooting from the hip)
* -83% spread while moving (shooting from the hip)
* -50% spread while moving (ADS)

Which is perfect for CQC (you really don't need ADS enhancing on this kind of close combats).

Angled/ folding grip works great shooting from mid ranges as it helps with the recoil *but* I believe that you should worry much more about bullet spread instead of recoil because you can always learn to counter it with practice but you can't do anything to avoid spread, so I'd prioritize erasing as much spread as I can.

Talking about compensator/ muzzle brake... well, I don't like either because of what I previously said: they leave you with a weapon that is easy to controll but won't work on mid ranges or will feel different while on CQ battles.

Free wifi is not ubiquitous in ""larger cities"", and it is certainly not ubiquitous in ""smaller cities"". Most fastfood/cafes have one, but it can be overloaded/out of order/paranoid filtered, so I'd not count on that. (Free wifi is free for all, so passing by teenagers theoretically can see some XXX action or drug selling sites, which is a no-no.) BUT. There will be neighbours, and some of those most certainly will have a slightly underused fiber/wifi. I'd not count on that too, but I'd ask about; it generally can be negotiated (may be for a price) if you're being nice. Do your research though; $100 for 1 Mbit/s is waaaay overpriced even on North Pole.

As for cellular, there is no real prepaid as far as I know, only contracts and more contracts (not really expensive, but passport is absolutely required). Finding a store with USB dongles isn't a problem even in smaller ""smaller"" cities, and of course is not a problem in Kazan. Buying one is whole another story. Generally you can't get a cellular service contract without a passport. I'd ask local contacts for buying you a dongle with a contract; it's not a big deal unless you forget to cancel it when it is not needed anymore. Or you can go full official. As far as I know, Megafon deals with foreign citizens, it just needs a shitload of legal papers. There is a page on theirs site about ""Условия подключения"".

Assuming Utopia, disprove Utopia?

Ok, I'll give it a shot.

**Religion:** The human body is held to be sacred by most. Experimentation violates this principle, regardless of consent.

**Philosophically:** Aside from the fact that large scale consent cannot be guaranteed, experimentation dehumanises both those experimented on and those experimenting, reducing them entirely to objects.

**Psychologically:** Anyone who consents to such treatment is likely mentally ill. Moreover, such treatment would likely induce mental illness, so a persons consent would retroactively become void. Consent is continuous.

**Anthropologically:** In certain cultures such as Japan, people may feel culturally pressured to conform and consent en masse.

**Sociologically:** In America, those in prisons tend to be from ill-treated groups along racial, ethnic and class lines. Furthermore, there's the slippery slop argument to contend with, which in this case seems valid.

**Scientifically:** Science and scientists have been struggling over the last few decades to dissociate themselves from past misdeeds and create robust ethical standards. Your proposal would undermine that.

Lastly and most importantly, could people opt out while and experiment is ongoing? If not, then consent is irrelevant and your proposal is immoral. If so, then data is corrupted and your proposal is impractical."

reighbooker,marketing,1388697373.0,"You've made a lot of assumptions, but that's probably because I am a terrible writer.
I am a 29 year old woman, with a long history of management. I've worked in the non-profit sector my entire adult life and I also serve on the board of many other local non-profits. I have an incredible track record of always being positive with a focus on moving forward and I have also given several seminars to young professional in the non-profit sector about remaining positive in ""making it work"". Something non-profits are told to do repeatedly. It's not the lack of tools I'm frustrated with, or the unwillingness to throw money to solve a problem. It's the complete lack of structure this team has. Many teams I work with complain about their issues and then we work together to solve the problem- with track-able goals and feedback opportunities. I feel like this team loves hating their jobs and from an outside perspective, it's no wonder they have a bad reputation with staff. 

Personally, I like to be managed very ""old-school""- strictly with upfront criticisms, so while you're comments hurt me- I think I will keep coming back and reading your comment more than others to learn. I use to manage this way until I realized it just doesn't work for most people- so I've had to cultivate this skill. I was being blunt and honest in my frustrations and that painted a negative whiny image, so I apologize. I'm really a funny, upbeat person- I swear!

And I think many of you're statements, while serve as really good ""keep this mind"" for me- are incorrect. If you're so familiar with non-profits, you should know that every employee wears 50 hats. I believe the more I learn about marketing &amp; communications- the better I will be at my job. I started learning what I could online and reading what I could get my hands on but again, being a non-profit, especially a specialized niche one- all the articles were just not the right fit. So I thought I would talk to my peers who deal with it everyday and bit off more than I could chew. 
I am in charge of several budgets of my own for this organization- and people often come to me for advice. I believe they won't show me any budgets is because they don't have any. Which is crazy, because they are all overhead.
I just wanted some insight on how to have a successful communications team- and also vent my frustrations. Perhaps doing both diluted the original reason for this post. 
While you are correct, I'm not a higher up manager and I think I tend to get more involved than I should/people want me to, I was hoping this would be an added learning opportunity and it's turned into an entire new role for me. One that I'm happy to take, as I found a real interest in this field. I think the team enjoys having me on board, if only to be a sounding board, and want to work in moving forward- but I'm having a hard time getting through to them.

Any other advice you have knowing a little bit more would be helpful. "

Anyway, the results look promising. Only a 17% reduction in work, and that in itself may be overstated due to the fact that they were using a NIT rather than a basic income. 

It seems that most arguments against implementation in the US are the result of values. In the 70s, divorce was evil and blah blah blah, nowadays, no one cares but a small minority of fundamentalists. As it said in the article though, people would prefer welfare with work requirements, and this is something that needs to be worked on in terms of values because we have an entire generation of people to grow up since then that have adopted such a Reagan-esque paradigm.

Eat.

When you are hungry, eat.

When you are full, eat.

When you are bored, eat.

When you are busy, eat.

Eat, eat, eat, eat. Don't worry so much as to WHAT you're eating, just how much of it you're eating. Once you can get used to putting up big caloric numbers, then you can start making sure you're hitting your macros and such. It's all about baby steps.

My plan with a sub was to start without and see how things went.  I may add one at a later date, but figure if it's not necessary then I needn't have to deal with the extra complication.

Visiting a dealer is going to be complicated.  The nearest KEF dealer to me is a ""home integration"" specialist, I'm going to get in touch and see if they have a demo room, but I'm not too hopeful.  Beyond that I'm looking at a nearly 600 mile round trip.  Right now I'm having to fall back on reading as much as I can, and being prepared to take advantage of return policies if things don't work out okay.

With that in mind I'm tempted to order the M1PWRs and LS50s and approach it all as an in-home demo."

Their room considering they were pretty wealthy could have taken up half that floor if it was the penthouse level in a Waldorf or something like it. I am just speculating because I didn't write the movie. But the molding of the ledge Mal is standing on is the exact same as what Cobb is standing on. She left the window open where she wanted Cobb to be, Mal was very thorough with her set-up. She was trying to force Cobb's hand like he had forced her's in their dream world.

PoliticoG,malefashionadvice,1388697517.0,"1. Congrats on getting into the conference. I'm a MUN vet myself. 
2. I'd held if you listed the formalwear you have, including outerwear. 

Aside from that: 
You only NEED one suit for a MUN conference. I'd go black or navy, make sure it fits well. Bring a shirt and tie for each day, though, of vastly differing colors. If it were me, I'd do white, light blue, and a nice patterned shirt. Black, dark blue, and a tie that compliments the pattern nicely. 

If you have one, wear a simple lapel pin of the flag of the nation which you represent. It makes you more identifiable on the first day and during unmods. DO NOT wear ties of that nation's flag, make stupid accents or do ""native dress"". I will bitch slap your noob ass if you do. Kids that do that on my committees do not get award consideration. Same goes for all of my friends that staff. 

On the plane: wear a nice white t shirt, some dark jeans, and comfortable sneakers. I'd also wear the suit jacket over the t. It is generally frowned upon to wear a suit jacket as an odd jacket, but you can get away with it once and it saves you the pain in the ass of folding a suit jacket. That's also your #1 casual outfit. 

For casual #2 outfit, keep the jeans from the plane ride, but add a polo in a solid color. Or do the light blue formal shirt with a sweater over it. 

One pair of dress shoes that go with both the jeans and the suit.

If it were me I'd keep a spare set of clothes: jeans, a t shirt, socks, shoes, a sweater and some Vans, in a trash bag inside of your suitcase. That way if your suitcase finds its way into water for some reason, you're not naked, wet, or cold. That last bit comes from experience. 

Good luck, delegate. Just out of curiosity, what's the committee, topic, and your country assignment?

ActingPower,MLPAnalysis,1388697550.0,"[](/flutterfear-i) While I agree with your first points, I don't agree with your last one. Making the show too fantastic can make the lesson at the end veer into ""Space Whale Aesop"" territory. Besides, some of the most popular episodes are ones like Suited for Success and Sonic Rainboom, episodes which are more slice-of-life and personal than fantastic. 

[](/sp)

[](/hmmm-i) One of the points Digi brought up is that all six of the characters have shown up in every episode (except Flight to the Finish), but they never have anything to do. Daring Don't needed RD and Twi at most, Bats! needed AJ, Fluttershy, and Twi at most, and Castle Mane-ia and Power Ponies were cramped and rushed. (The opener technically needs all six of them, but it really only focuses on Twi and maybe AJ.) This is a symptom of more adventure-driven episodes, but more importantly, it means that valuable screen time that could be used to develop a relationship between two ponies or bolster one pony's characteristics is instead left to gags and quips. 

[](/shiningarmor-i) I guess the way I see it is in a simple summary: the show is called ""Friendship is Magic."" The most important, most interesting, most enjoyable episodes are the ones that show friendships and how they are, in fact, magic."
