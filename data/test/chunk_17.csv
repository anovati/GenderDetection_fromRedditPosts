He could have learned German and Ukrainian as well as English, but why would he if they all spoke English? Sure there were some other Norwegian immigrants around, but unless he only wanted to associate with them, there wasn't much point in his kids learning Norwegian.

You really, really don't understand that when it comes to ease of getting sex, and ease of beginning a relationship, women have to expend literally zero effort.  They get, as you put it ""offers"" on a regular enough basis that they will complain about how annoying it is.

Men don't, and the fact that *some* attractive women have *temporary* spells when they aren't getting offers from *exactly* the men they want does nothing to support this ludicrous notion you have that there is any symmetry in this area.

And the bolts were all interchangeable and love that about Mausers. I'm not afraid to do some work, I spent about 9 hours taking apart and cleaning the Yugo I got because it had an absolutely insane about of cosmoline in it. 
That's really neat you can do that, so that you can use every inch of the original stock the rifle came with. I'm not to that level of skill yet, but maybe one day. What I can do right now is basic repairs and restorations. Like with the Gew98 I'm looking at. 
I'll definitely be keeping my eyes open for a deal, be it sporters or just barreled receivers. I actually found a decent K98 dot barreled receiver, but it doesn't even have the sights on it so it would take several hundreds of dollars to fix up into a proper Mauser. But if I can find cheap stuff like that and get the parts over time I'm sure I could make something decent. 
I'll look into the C&amp;R thing, but I heard once that if you get one the government says that they can come and inspect your guns at any time. Is that true? 
Thank you again so much for all your help and tips. If I am in need of a part I'll be sure to ask you how much you'd sell it for! I understand that once I have a career I'll have more money, but the prices will also go up so its kind of an expensive circle. Get money -&gt; gun price goes up -&gt; get more money -&gt; gun prices goes up again, etc. 
Thanks again for all the help!"

peck i liked but wanted a different jock villager. (rod, though he moved in right next to town hall somehow)

agnes i didn't totally care for (though she gave me her pic at least 3-4 times)

mallary i street passed from a friend, and don't really care for her (id much rather have whitney as a snooty villager)

Slukaj,conspiratard,1389148648.0,"&gt; They knew very well that if they lost power they would lose cooling, and that would lead to a meltdown. 

No fucking shit, *every* reactor does that. Name *one goddamn reactor that doesn't fail catastrophically when it loses power.* 

Conventional reactor safety design necessitates a source of secondary power to keep coolant flowing in the event of a shutdown. Even if you SCRAM a reactor, it can take upwards of *6 months* for a full shutdown to occur. During that time, you *MUST* have backup power running coolant along the fuel rods. 

&gt; They just crossed their fingers and hoped it would never happen.

How in the hell do you engineer a solution that would protect *anything* from the destructive power of the 5th most powerful tsunami on record? 

The *only* valid solution that I will give is that the reactor should've been built further inland and there should have been better backup generator locations. 

You act like a bunch of cowboys looked at the brief, slapped a big-ol-rubber stamp on the thing and called it a day. The reality is that the Tohoku tsunami was the epitome of ""freak occurance"". Everything that could have possibly gone wrong went wrong. Reactors generally have more failsafe systems than the friggin Saturn V rocket did, and for good reason.

But when god wants to shit on your parade, there isn't much we can do to stop him and maybe think about not putting the parade in the same damn place.

&gt; This document explores some of the new possibilities for failure which have been discovered since then.

A failure that can *only* occur after everything else has failed. The heats described in the document are already well beyond the operational temperature of a reactor to begin with. If you hit that heat, something else has probably already failed before then. 

&gt; nuclear reactor to explode

IN A CHEMICAL FUCKING EXPLOSION. *NOT A FISSION EXPLOSION*. SL-1 was a steam over pressure, Chernobyl was a steam over pressure, Fukushima was a hydrogen explosion fueled by electrical dialysis, Three Mile Island did nearly the same thing. 

&gt; nuclear explosions can range in explosive power from a fizzle up to the Tsar Bomb

Do you have any idea what the *actual* name of a nuclear explosion is? *A fission reaction*, the same goddamn thing that reactors use to produce heat. We simulated the first atomic explosion *in a reactor at Chicago Pile-1* in 1942. 

If it helps you understand, nuclear reactors are operating on the same underlying principle as a slow nuclear explosion.

&gt; There is so much nuclear material scattered around Fukushima that nobody knows what could happen if, for instance, the SFP in building 4 collapsed.

Except that the containment in the Daiichi Fukushima plants *have not been breached*. The hydrogen explosions occurred in the building that houses the containment structures themselves. The big damn difference between Chernobyl and Fukushima is that *Fukushima HAS A CONTAINMENT WHILE CHERNOBYL DIDN'T*. The extent of the disaster has already been significantly mitigated just by virtue of being an American/GE design, which are REQUIRED BY LAW to have containment buildings. 

&gt; Let's agree that neither of us wants that to happen.

No goddamn shit. But anyone who A) claims this was the worst nuclear accident ever and B) claims that this was a *nuclear fission explosion* has no goddamn idea what the hell they are talking about. "

I was taught in my upbringing that suicide sends one to Hell, so if I attempt heroism that ends up in my getting murdered, I'd have a better next life to look forward to. (Wouldn't I? It's my death by *someone else's hand.*)

&gt; I mean, if life sucks that bad, imagine it just like it is... but *now you're paralyzed too!*

**Will that new disability discharge my ~$108,000 in student loans?**

I've seen some futurology topics (/r/futurology) about exoskeletons helping people off of wheelchairs, so an exoskeleton could get me back on my feet.

Besides, if my story is reported in a newspaper of my attempting to be a hero and getting wounded in the process, I'd turn into a local celebrity, right? Wouldn't employers be far more interested in hiring me after reading about my attempt to thwart a crime? Employers who like heroes may be more than happy to lend a helping hand and accommodate my new disability, I suppose?

And after anybody in my life who betrayed me awhile ago finds out about these heroics, it may cause them to vindicate / forgive me too, wouldn't it?

Another thing to point out: Of all the homeless people I've seen, *how come none of them are in wheelchairs?* Some kind of support program might ensure I never lose a roof over my head if I'm confined to a wheelchair, right? ^(I've had a phobia about homelessness for years now...)"

- more imagery.  I can't stress this enough in fiction writing: *more imagery.*  I really want to *see* the vaccine-wheeling-gold-loving aliens, not just be *told* about them (showing vs. telling).

- you have yet to find your narrative voice.  It's a bit dry and could use some more personality.  What is the narrator's relationship to the Annunaki?  To the people of Earth?

- The whole idea of doing things for gold is cliche and overdone.  Why would aliens care about a yellow metal?  hell *I* don't even care about gold.  This needs to be either explained more fully or changed completely.

- We need more historical background on all of the various groups mentioned.

- This is good for satire, but I suggest going even more into the crazy zone, a la Swift's ""A Modest Proposal.""  Go full baby-cooking.

Necron_Overlord,OneY,1389149401.0,"&gt;Secretaries used to be a job done by men and a job on a track towards upper management. Once it was done predominantly by women, it became the receptionist we have today.

That's not even remotely true.

The medieval title of Secretary referred originally to a junior adjunct within the office of a Chamberlain, and would correspond to what we would now call an executive.  He often sat at a desk in his master's office (*in a castle*), which was smaller and typically had a closing hutch.  These tables came to be known [secretaries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_desk).

Centuries later, as the modern office environment began to develop, there was a need for personal assistants to handle light clerical work, take dictation, etc.  Often a young, unmarried woman was hired for these kinds of jobs.  Originally, she would sit in her employer's office at her own desk -- a secretary desk! Which is how women who did that job came to be known as [secretaries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary).

I'm not small in my upper body or exceedingly disproportionate as of yet, but I'm addressing the situation before it becomes an issue.  Lately, I've been doing less legs, as to not look asymmetrically bottom-heavy.  I've basically compressed my leg day into 1) squats, 2) calf raises, and 3) bent-leg deadlifts.  I'll go back to normal leg days after a few months of this, but its something I've committed to, for the time being.

If you want my opinion, (and take it with a grain of salt, because we're all different), try doubling the weekly volume of leg exercises and reducing upper body by half.  Make sure you squat and deadlift as heavy as you can with good form.

He will eventually be too tempted and will fly back to his cage voluntarily. Make a big deal out of it when he flys willingly. 

Once he gets comfortable doing this start moving the perch all around, still in view of his cage. Once he freely returns to his cage, put him on his cage and start making the perch attractive the same way you did with his cage originally. It might take some time or he may figure this whole thing out in a day or two without even needing the second step.

Read my other response to the other guy. I've clearly cited multiple reports, studies, anecdotal evidence and quotes directly from Asian cultures showing xenophobia towards others and nationalist-motivated purchasing decisions.

&gt; the Xbox was designed for Americans specifically. 

I'd argue the Xbox was designed for the West in general, but yes, Americans were probably the target. Still, seeing as the west has dictated game development and purchases for the past 20 years or so, it's not that hard of a stretch to imagine that as a good idea to Microsoft.

&gt; Just think about the Xbox controllers and how gargantuan they used to be. Well, Japanese people aren't as large as Americans. So, Xbox controllers would be uncomfortable to them.

Yes, and that's why they created the Xbox Controller S, which debuted in Japan. But, looking back, the original Xbox controller was the same size or smaller than the [Dreamcast's *and* the Saturn 3D control pad. ](http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/110/1100542/2366082-3840011216-contr.jpg)

Besides all that, the [Xbox debuted in Japan with the Controller S](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Controller), which was smaller for Japanese hands, so it's a moot point anyway, since all Japanese Xboxes came with Japanese-sized controllers.

That also doesn't explain why the 360 flopped in Japan, especially when it was designed by a Japanese design agency. In fact, Microsoft went out of its way to appeal to the Japanese market by using Japanese input, making a smaller, slimmer console, making the smaller Xbox 360 controller standard, and securing Japanese developer support for games like the Final Fantasy franchise. 

&gt; [""Microsoft placed special emphasis on appealing to Japanese consumers as it created the
industrial design for Xbox 360.""](http://www.edge-online.com/news/xbox-360-design-saw-japanese-input/)"

It depends on how much they make it sounds like.   If a kid makes more than $5800 a year then he has to file, but few kids make that much.

Whether something is legal or not can come from two approaches: legal unless proven harmful, or illegal until proven harmless.  We take the former approach, because the latter approach is extremely costly, even for the things that're harmless. That cost limits the development of new drugs.

The FDA has had a long list of items that it has banned, time and resources permitting, that were commonly used as medicine.  That's why you don't see Paregoric or Mercurochrome around even though these were common medicines in the past.

Manchester United are also not the best team in their own league, let alone the world. Anyone would take Messi for free but when you're already so much better than your competition, its essentially a vanity purchase.

No team is perfect, but Bayern is easily the closest right about now. When you can handily beat all your opponents and win competitions like they can with their current squad, you don't *need* anyone. They could improve the team even further, sure, but what can that do for them beyond what they can already accomplish?

That's a whole new can of worms but i'll answer it. Did we need him, maybe. Chelsea don't have the best team in the world so any improvements are welcome. Assuming he took the place of KDB and Moses, then perhaps it was the right decision because they've been poor this season. He hasn't been a game-changer exactly, but he has made contributions that our other options may not have made. He also gives us more depth that we really needed before we had all these players in attacking midfield.

Maybe in the US, but such laws have already been (sort of) implemented in other countries. In Japan, for example, if your car is older than around 5 years it becomes prohibitively expensive to ensure that it's held up to yearly inspection standards unless you take great care with your car and know how to maintain it extremely well.

No rioting in Japan when such laws were introduced, because people generally accepted you can't drive a hunk of junk on the road and expect to be safe. If you can't afford a new car in Japan, you move to somewhere with public transport or you walk/ride your bike.

I'd imagine this would be the leadup to an eventual ban - some sort of higher tax on manually driven cars which would be used to fund the health system. And naturally, insurance premiums will be cheaper by default for self-driving cars, providing further economic incentives.

&gt;Another thing issue will be people actually using the self driving feature.

ProffieThrowaway,GirlGamers,1389150370.0,"During my sophomore year (and last year in the dorms because SCREW THAT) we had separate stall showers.... and no hot water. Three floors of the dorm had freezing cold showers 100% of the time, and the school either didn't care to or could not figure out how to fix it. 

Most of us took to showering as little as possible because it was VERY uncomfortable, especially since the school was located in an area where it snowed early and hard and often. We all smelled. The creepiest part was the guys that only started hitting on us when we were at our stinkiest. YEESH.

So yeah, I know the communal showering/showering facilities can really suck, but at the point at which I stop doing in class exercises that involve students moving around the room because I can't stand to stir up the air around them or have them smell more from moving around, something has to give (and yes, that's a thought I've had more than one term). There are other showering options on our campus--like at the gym, for example. Faced with a bad showering situation I did so in friends' rooms/halls, and we treated ourselves (like 4 of us in one room) to a hotel room for part of finals week. The next year I got an apartment--screw that. heh."

I've seen a lot of posts saying how depressing this sub can be for shorter people. I just wanted to pop in and say thank you for opening my eyes.
When I was a teen, I dated a guy who was about a foot shorter than me. We were soooo in love as teens are apt to be. I remember riding around town in his mustang, trying to find a secret spot to make-out, comparing our hand sizes... he loved my long fingers and I loved his strong hands with guitar calluses on the findertips. I never gave a second thought to the whole height disparity... until...

Many of my friends said we looked ""weird"" together. Some guys would claim that I ""could do so much better"". I didn't understand. He was a musician and I was an idealist. We were so happy together. Why would people care about our height?

I never let the comments bother me too much while we dated, but it did subconciously invade my thoughts throughout my 20s. I spent so much of my time considering how the person I chose to date would look to outside observers. I knew from experience that tall girl/short boy combos attracted a lot of undue attention and I actively sought to avoid that. If a man approached me who was shorter than me, I would automatically dismiss them as boyfriend material. I wasn't trying to be mean or discriminatory, I was just trying to stay in the shadows. I am so sorry for that. I can't begin to understand how that made you feel. It was unfair, shallow, and completely shitty of me.
Now that I am 30, single again, and have had my share good and bad relationships, I am once again ready to confront my demons. It's tough being a tallish girl, but I see that it is much more difficult being a short guy.

Like i said at the beginning, thank you for helping me look back and see where my height descrimination began. It's really hard for me to look past what others think of what I do, but I'm going to be much more aware of it now, thanks to this sub. I look forward to seeing things again through the uncorrupted eyes I had before the teasing began. Kids are fucking cruel, man. I'll never be able to allow myself to consider height as a factor in the dating world ever again.

TLDR: Keep up the good fight. This sub may be depressing at times, but it really does make a difference. Knowlege is power!"

Necron_Overlord,OneY,1389150539.0,"Also, the jobs ""traditionally"" done by women generally are seen to have little prestige because before the middle of the 20th century, women's work was either working class drudgery which has mostly been automated and no longer exists as work, or jobs done by young, middle and upper class women between schooling and marriage.

Some of those jobs -- nursing and elementary instruction in particular -- have become actual *careers* in the late 20th century.  Elementary instruction has become a much more serious profession as our demands of the educational system have increased, while nursing had completely changed as medical science had grown dramatically in the last century.  Men are struggling to get into those lines of work, especially as the manufacturing economy disappears.

The few other examples of work that is still ""women's work"" are all low-skill, entry level jobs with limited or no future, such as retail sales and clerical work.  Men aren't seeking these jobs because employer are strongly biased in favor of female applicants, and there is no social support for men whose aspirations are just to get a dead-end job so they can stay afloat.

2nd edit: This mini is a billion (yes, a billion) times better than their previous one.  I like every single song, and Subin gets a solo?  That's actually really good?  With a good rapper (Ilhoon)?  ""Rewind"" is my favorite track, followed by Subin's solo song."

Mostly because Danzo used Izanagi throughout the whole fight even though there are jutsus that do the same thing with much less sacrifice (Sasuke used the Substitution Jutsu just fine right after the fight) and Danzo was supposedly Hokage material, so he should've been able to use more jutsu. On top of that, how did he expect to replace the Sharingan that he had implanted in his arm if he won against Sasuke if most of the Uchiha are dead (which he saw to)? I would've thought that Izanagi was useful as a last resort/trump card, like when Tobi/Obito used it during his fight with Konan, not all at once when other methods of avoiding attacks could've been used."

There's a GIGANTIC text box on the top of your screen that lets you look up pretty much anything you want. And yet for some reason people sit around scratching their heads wishing for a way to know the answer to things that can be found in less than 10 seconds by just typing in two words into that text box.

Normally I wouldn't be so annoyed by this laziness. But that fact that I'm being told to ""take notes, this is how you reference something (AKA encourage laziness)"" really bugs me. &gt;:/ I'm the one who gave those short ""X and Y"" answers! I was walking into class. Didn't have time to fetch you links from Google on my phone in time span of the few seconds that I used to walk into class and sit down. You however were most likely reclined in your comfy computer chair, twiddling your thumbs with nothing else to do. Nothing was stopping you from going to Google for 2 seconds.

Teach a man to fish and fee him for a lifetime! ""X and Y"" is enough to get you looking for the answer. Type in ""Pokemon Ultimate Weapon"" and there will be dozens of videos, wiki articles, forum posts etc etc etc showing and describing what this weapon is. Now that you know how to Google you won't bother people to give you the answers on a silver platter while you sit back and laze around ""wishing"" you had access to some sort of digital information catalog (like the Internet!) So yeah. This is for your own good. I'm teaching you that you never ever have to ever be wondering and wishing you understood a reference when it's literally RIGHT there in front of your face. &gt;:/

Anytime you see a quote, a word, or ANYTHING that makes no sense to you... put little quotes around it... type it in Google and there you go! It's so freaking easy. It takes seconds. I'm am SUPER sorry but..GRRR the fact that I seriously read ""Take notes people! Give me all the answers when I demand them because I'm too lazy to press a couple of keys on the keyboard!""

/End rant 

I fully except downvotes if anyone even sees this. And I'll take them since this wasn't as civil as this could be. But...oh my god.

It's really, really not.

To give just one example, my aunt is the most devout person I've ever met: a daily communicant who is never without a Bible or religious literature of some sort. She volunteers for Catholic charities and is a pro-life activist. Her husband leads the music at Sunday Mass and says grace before every meal. Her daughters (they have no sons) are devout Catholics who are raising their young children in Catholicism.

When she married her husband, he was a non-practising Anglican. Through her unspoken influence, he returned to the Church of England and, after twenty years of seeing how Catholicism enriched and influenced her life and those of their children, he was received into the Church.

I am sorry you had such a rough time of it, and that you think your parents' religious differences were to blame. There are many reasons why two people should not marry each other: religion is usually only one of them, alongside personality clashes, confrontation, stubbornness and callousness, for example.

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1389151264.0,"In general?  Honestly...yes.  I've noticed among my girl friends who aren't in to games and can generally be described as normal, average women....yeah, they see it as a red flag.  Maybe not a deal breaker.  But it says ""proceed with caution"" to my friends, because a number of them HAVE dated a guy (usually during high school or college), who gave them a terrible experience.  They were with hardcore male gamers who picked games over them, refused to go out because of gaming, things like that...situations where gaming took away from relationship time.  It's one thing to have a hobby, but you have to have balance.  I'm a gamer myself, my boyfriend is as well, but he doesn't choose to play a game and cancel hanging out with me.  My ex-boyfriend, however, did choose games over me a number of times.  It's very aggravating, and can be hard to explain to male gamers sometimes - they often don't realize that this hobby has taken over their life and is affecting it aversely. The straw that broke the camel's back with my ex, for instance, was because of one night where I was physically assaulted on the subway.  I called him right after, panicked and nearly crying...and the first thing he says after I finish telling him what happened is, ""I have to get back to my Starcraft game.  I'll talk to you later. *click*.""

I would say that is letting your hobby aversely affect your relationship....and since I play SC as well, I knew 40min later is when he'd call me, when his match ended...made me so mad."

Blacksheep01,buildapc,1389151269.0,"I actually do have a closed loop water cooler in my 130m for the CPU. This version of the case is also better ventilated than earlier incarnations and features lots of air holes and a mesh front that holds a 120mm fan (for the water cooler or air). The GPU, for example, sits directly next to a bunch of openings in the side of the case so air exhausts directly out of the device from the side instead of kicking around inside, even without having a blower style cooler.

Unbelievably, my interior temps (mobo, GPU) are lower in the 130 than in my old mid-tower Raidmax Smilodon. The CPU is cooler also, but I didn't have water cooling in my old case, so that is an unfair comparison.

If so, look at the order he created stuff. Look at the day he created animals, he could have been making them and at the same time some were becoming extinct! Think of all that time between the making of animals and humans. I would say that is plenty of time for a bit of evolution to take place.

keakealani,TrollXChromosomes,1389151337.0,"The best decision I've ever made (or that my life made for me, in some respects) was taking off a year between high school and college. Sure, dropping out at the very last second without having actually applied to any colleges was a big factor, but I learned a LOT about my life by spending that year doing a combination of binge WoW-ing, volunteering at a conservation nonprofit, teaching music, and learning anything and everything I could get my hands on. It taught me a lot, both about what not to do and what to do (spoiler alert: having absolutely no goals isn't actually as fun as it sounds).

Compared to my peers that dove straight into college from high school, I feel really lucky that I had a year to get my shit together, weigh some of my options, and overall give myself a chance to learn and grow. And it definitely informed the major I eventually decided on, which did have a profound effect on my career options. If I hadn't had the time to reflect on what it would mean to major in a ""risky"" (in the sense of relatively low income potential) field, I probably wouldn't have chosen it. But I learned that loving what I do is more important to me than money, and that I can still make enough to live on while doing something I'm passionate about. 

I'm genuinely glad for the folks who made great decisions in their teens about what they want to do with their lives, and I don't want to sound like nobody has that capacity. But I definitely feel that taking another approach can be valuable for many if not most people - a lot of use simply needed a little more time to figure shit out, and I don't understand why that fact is so often overlooked.

Few years ago, Kiddo and I flew from KCI to LAX with a layover in Denver.  My second time on a plane, her first.

Week later, on the return trip, we're at LAX, and I go to pay my luggage fee...and realize it's $20....and I have $19 left on my card. We wind up calling my mom, who gives her CC over the phone, and finally it all gets worked out.  The desk person looks at my ticket, tells me gate Whatever, and we take off speedwalking to make it.  I'm actually DRAGGING the kiddo.   We get to our gate...and realize they told us the wrong gate number.  We rush back to ours, and they've finished boarding.  Now, we can see our plane.  We can see the hallway still attached...but some guy says we can't board, and we're screwed.  They put us on standby, but don't know if we can get out that day.

Drifting in and starting off in the central berth are different kettles of fish because there are different responsibilities and opportunities (and more importantly passing options). 


He's not good enough for a CL side on the wing. It's that simple. So he'll be sold this summer (if we keep Moyes).  I am confident he'll be a sensation back at Dortmund or playing in the hole elsewhere by what I've seen of him. Moyes never committed to experimenting with Kagawa in the hole.

do you care about d1 sports?

I'm honestly not sure.  Look at my posts to /r/knives and look at my comments there.  I was completely baffled when I was banned, and the mod (/u/akrabu) wasn't much help either.  

I messaged him and asked him why I was banned; his response was, ""You know exactly why.""  I told him that I didn't know why and if I could have an explanation... he told me, ""Don't act stupid, you know why.""  I never got a response out of him.

Here's the conversation:

&gt;**akrabu (mod)**

*myself (each line is a message)*

--------------

&gt;you have been banned from posting to /r/knives: Knives and other blade related content.

?

the fuck?

...

Is the ban permanent?

Are you still not going to give me a legit reason why I'm banned?

I got a message yesterday telling me I am banned from r/knives. No reason, no warning, just a ban.

&gt;Spamming

Is it permanent? And when did I spam?

Can you get back to me?
When did I spam... and how long is this ban???

&gt;Your account is banned forever. Don't play dumb. You know why you are banned.

The fuck? Why am I banned?

I've been posting in r/knives for the past 2 months and have never had any of this bullshit.

Hey asshole, are you going to tell me why I'm actually banned?

------------------------------------

Never got a response from him after that, and I guess he does this very often.  He even made a post about him being drunk one time and banning a bunch of people because he got mad.  He's very immature, has an inferiority complex, and he's power-hungry.  He has banned many people, and that is why /r/knifeclub was formed.

girlscout-cookies,AskHistorians,1389152017.0,"One of my favorite museums is the Ulster Museum in Belfast: part history museum, part natural history museum, tiny bit art museum, all in one building and entirely free. It's probably not the best museum in Europe, as much as I love it, but I bring it up because the basement of the Ulster Museum is devoted to the Troubles in Northern Ireland. There aren't any artifacts in this exhibit, a purposeful choice. At first I was skeptical - museums are supposed to have artifacts, right? 

But you walk through it, reading this plain gray text printed on these plain white walls; a few black-and-white photographs are printed on the walls, blown up. If you've been going through the exhibits in order, you've seen the foundation for the Troubles being laid, decade by decade, and then you get to this part and you see its conclusion, the riots and bombings and IRA splinter groups laid in front of you one by one. And I think the plain text, the plainness of the white walls and the simplicity of the exhibit, gives the viewer a chance to consider the events anew, to take everything in. And then at the end there's some paper and pencils and you can write your thoughts. It's this quiet, introspective space, encouraging you to take a moment or two and reflect on the enormity of this very *loud* history. Not just in the museum, but in Belfast itself. 

So there are no artifacts, yet it's an incredibly powerful, thoughtful space. It's in Belfast, the heart of the Troubles (well, not to exclude Derry), it understands its place, and it isn't arguing for anything more. It doesn't need artifacts. I think shoving things in there would only distract you from the introspection that the exhibit is going for. What artifacts it needs are elsewhere in the museum, part and parcel of the long and complicated history that led to the Troubles, the confluences of people and events and ideas that made them happen. 

I think an exhibit that knows what it wants to say, and knows how to say it, is a successful one: one that makes its viewers think, consider something anew, see something in a different way than before. And for that reason, I think the Ulster Museum will always be one of my favorites (that, and Belfast is one of my favorite cities).

Also, if I could design any exhibit or any museum I wanted, it would be a women's history museum. I don't know what I would put in it, but it would have more than dresses and shoes. "

Zel606,RealEstate,1389152023.0,"**Upkeep** - Though you don't live there full time, your nieghbors might.  And even if they don't, they probably also wouldn't want to see your dilapidated property.  That means making sure the grass stays mowed and/or other landscaping is kept presentable.  If you have no neighbors at your chosen location, kudos, else I recommend a secondary set of equipment - lawnmower/weedeater/shovels/and other tools.  Barring that you will be lugging things between the two properties and that can become tedious, especially when you go up there to do a specific task and leave 1 important tool at home, often ruining the day.

Not only that, but the place will need routine repairs, as does any house, though thats not necessarily a hidden expense, it can be frustrating, and at times, even more frequent than a house always lived in, as nature has a way of reclaiming what you aren't using.

**Water** - Our first lake house was only just a little out of the way (and still near a major city) - yet we had to have a well, which takes maintenance and costs more than city water.  To make it worse, the well water wasn't suitable for drinking (only dishes/toilet/shower/etc) so we still had to bring our own bottled water (either from home or the store).  Additionally, the well requires filters, and maintenance can be expensive depending on your location/parts/labor/model and how qualified you are personally to repair it.  Digging a well is a whole other matter entierly and can be very expensive, especially since some lakes are toxic and ruin the groundwater you would wish to drink.

**Dock** - I'm assuming you'll have a dock.  They're not that expensive, but replacing one that dies unexpectedly in a storm or from age can be an unfortunate expense.  You'll also certainly not want to hold onto an untrusty dock too long as it could seriously jeopardize your boat.  I recommend a dock since, at least at all of my lake houses, small fish love to live under it during the summer, making a great place for kids to fish a quick catch, or for you to fish for bait to catch larger fish.  A good dock can easily last you 10-30 years, and paid for over the life of the property isn't so bad.  But when buying an old property with an old dock, many don't realize the cost to replace/upgrade.

**Flood insurance** - Make sure you can get it.  You are very likely in a flood zone being right next to the water (though it depends on where exactly your lakehouse is) you should check it out, but that can be a monthly bill you wouldn't of otherwise entertained.

**Critters** - An empty home is quite an inviting place for nature.  Depending where you live, bugs or other more enterprising animals, (in the USA watch out for squirrels, raccoons, opossums, etc) may find your home warmer and more inviting than nature.  They may also help themselves to food you have stored within.  If you are in the USA, you may also need to worry about bears.  Many lake houses are off the beaten trail, though I've never had many issues besides them rummaging through the trash.

**Winterizing** - A boat must be winterized. The home will also need winterization if you won't be using it (or if it wasn't built for the winter).  Check out the insulation, heating type, quality of construction, possible spots for heat to leak.  Even if you don't plan to use it full time in the winter, the cost to keep it heated to a minimum temperature simply so your belongings don't ruin can be stupid expensive if you don't have a properly constructed edifice.

**Septic** - Many city folk have never had a septic tank before.  If your property will have one, best to research that...

&gt; you want beautiful football, go watch Barcelona, better yet, wait it out a couple years and watch us dominate the league once again, stronger than before.

There is absolutely no guarantee that we'll break from this trend with this manager. Especially as his style seems to be a much more defensive one at its core rather than a balls to the walls throw everything at it to get the points. I think you underplay the importance of style far too much. 

And more  to the point it's even less about the shit football without results to make up for it but the very soul of the team. For a while we looked like we wouldn't have a go at it after we dropped a goal. This game we gave it a go but looked pretty headless after that second goal. Where was the red faced scotsman? Where were the players who needed to prove something jumping on the pitch?

Gobizku,fatpeoplestories,1389152425.0,"&gt;This is what my theory claims to disprove.

Negs are never just straight up insults.  Ever.  They're usually light insults wrapped in a compliment, so as to sound playful, but to also avoid straight up complimenting someone.

Skinny bashing is just an insult.  It's not wrapped in anything, there's no sugar coating, and the whole concept of a neg only works against someone who thinks they the fucking best thing ever anyway.

If you want to actually get into seduction terms, you don't neg a 5 or 6, you'd typically only neg a a 9 or 10 that is use to getting complimented on a regular basis.  Negging a stranger who doesn't have high self esteem comes of as just an insult, and will turn them off immediately.  Furthermore you'd almost never neg someone on their weight because that's a sensitive issue for most people no matter how you dress it up.  It won't come off as playful.  Lastly, negging is typically intentional for most people that do it, very few would naturally do it as part of who they are.  It just so happens that those that did do it, noticed the reaction it got, and were able to repeat it with success.

Skinny bashing is not playful, it's not wrapped in a compliment, and it's hardly a light insult.  It's an insult and any sane person's response to an insult is going to be hostility.  The two are night and day different, and it seems that you may not truly understand what a neg is for, why you would do it, and when it's appropriate."

I was reminded of the teaching of the Dharmakaya and Sambhogakaya from Mahayana sutras, and wasn't too clear as to which is which...

No I haven't. Why did they say it was herectical?

Here's what I remember learning:

The Dharmakaya is the nature of perfect wisdom and perfection, beyond concepts, permeating everything. The Sambhogakaya body is one provisional aspect of the Dharmakaya, also known as the ""bliss bodies"" of Buddhas and Boddhisattvas, and seems to be the bodies they inhabit in their Pureland realms or in visions of advanced practitioners (these bodies are who those monks saw). This leaves the Nirmanakāya body, which is the bodies they manifest in time and space.

I cannot think of an equally silly pop culture reference to go with calling people a dick. When it comes down to it though, I never felt like there was much of a difference between dick and pussy in terms of severity. I did notice a large difference between any male genital slurs and the word cunt though. I do not know the reason that this is seen as so much more severe, but I would imagine there is story similar to ""nigger"", where the word was adopted by people to take ownership of the word in attempts to steal its power.

mysled,AustralianCattleDog,1389153038.0,"If you want a dog that will love all people/dogs, love cuddling, and happily laze about all day (a lot of people's typical idea of a dog), they are not the dog for you. 

If you want a super smart, incredibly loyal, and a little bit aloof dog that wants a good leader and a lot of mental and physical exercise, ACDs are perfect. 

The way I see it, getting an ACD mix was perfectly for me because I wanted to live, breathe, and spend every waking moment communicating, playing, entertaining, and learning with my dog; and she gives all of that back. She doesn't want to say hi to strangers on the street, she's rarely excited to meet new dogs, she has trained us perfectly to always give her a treat at bedtime, and she growls at us if we smother her too much, but we learn and laugh together constantly. 

If you put the effort and energy in, they are the best dogs (IMO). If you don't they can quickly become the worst. 

If she comes to work with me and plays with other dogs, she needs about an hour of off-leash walking. If she stays home, it's about 2 hours. She needs at least one long hike (1.5-3 hours) or bike ride on weekends. And it's all worth it :D"

More seriously:  had severe seasonal allergies when I was younger, still have them but are way less severe (used to have to be stoned on Benadryl for 3/4 of the year, these days I only need it a few days out of the year.)  I also had my sinuses roto-rootered to get out nasal polyps.  Relatedly, chronic, recurring ear infections until my mid teens.  I think I had more than a dozen sets of tubes put in over the course of my childhood.  I've had the ADHD/ADD label tossed at me a lot over the years, and I do have many symptoms convergent with it but what caused me to seek further diagnosis of Aspergers/HFA was that there were symptoms and markers which did not fit into the ADHD profile.  

I also have depression, anxiety and PTSD from some pretty potent trauma over the years which I won't get into here but am getting better at handling it.  Sometimes it knocks me down for a while but I usually manage to get back up without outside help.  I was/am pretty clumsy but after having taken a fair amount of fitness and martial arts classes, studied proper body mechanics; I have much better balance and am pretty graceful when I try, but much of that goes out the window when I'm not specifically focusing on being kinaesthetic... it's another one of those subroutines I have to run in my head, which only occurs with conscious thought and there isn't always room in my brain-pan for it if I'm having to focus on juggling several other things.  I tend heavily toward OCD but have managed to mitigate the more pervasive elements of it over the years and of those left, I give them healthy outlets.

You need to when these verses were revealed, why they were, and if a later verse came and nullified them before you pass judgment. For example, alcohol wasn't forbidden right away. First it was forbidden to be drunk in prayer, but later a verse came and made it forbidden completely. Further, there are verses saying to kill the disbelievers, but these came in a time when the companions of the prophet where being tortured and killed for speaking against the practices of the area, because it was what islam came to right. The then Arabian society was where the strong exploit the weak.  Women, children, orphans and slaves had no rights and little protection. Marriage took various forms and was generally a loose affair. There was no limit to the number of women a man could marry at one time. Divorce was unrestricted. Adultery was common, men took their immoral exploits and some even wrote poems about them. They also glorify in drunkenness and consorting with dancing girls. Women were not normally entitled to inherit property. Anyways, after being tortured and killed, they fled mecca. When the arabs came to finish of the muslims, the verse came down to ""kill the disbelievers where they stand"". Somewhat like if a country was at war for example china, the orders would be to kill any Chinese you see. However, the verse no longer is relevant, like when a war ends.

Buscat,4chan,1389153315.0,"/fit/ and most of the fitness subreddits tend to prefer compound lifting to any kind of isolation exercises, so doing curls is bad enough in their eyes. But to need a machine to do an arm isolation exercise, which is like the simplest thing you can do with a dumbell? That's the epitome of the people they look down on at the gym, always overcomplicating things, being scared of learning and depending on machines..

And they have a point. For any given exercise the free weight version, where available, will be superior to the machine version, for purposes of working a variety of accessory/stabilizer muscles. And machines can restrict your range of motion into one that is unnatural and harmful to you. Gyms tend to prefer them though because people who don't know what they're doing find the free weights intimidating and don't know how to use them, while machines are pretty obvious and have the instructions right on them. People who don't know what they're doing are also less likely to hurt themselves in the short term on machines, causing insurance problems. If they do their muscles long-term damage from shitty machines though, that's lot harder to establish in court, so preferable from an insurance standpoint. "

This has nothing to do with theology. Just because God uses natural law as a tool does not make things meaningless. If anything, it makes it all more meaningful. God lovingly sculpted the universe. God cared enough so that we can be in an environment that is conducive to our living. God make the world work in a way that helps us fight disease because we can study animals with similar genetic codes. We can prolong life because of this. "

FrazAFC94,NBA2k,1389153679.0,"I got drafted to the Pelicans, stupidly, on my current gen career mode. Whilst it was a fun team with Ryno &amp; Eric Gordon hitting three point bombs and Aminu &amp; The Brow finishing off oops, it was a bit of a logjam. The bench was fairly solid but having a 90 rated PG already in Jrue Holiday and then drafting myself (who had spent some VC on upgrading my stats to about 84) just made no sense. I repeatedly asked the GM to trade him in exchange for a valuable SF but nothing ever amounted.

I think a team like Jazz (who I'm with in my Next Gen season) are quite good as you can run effective pick and rolls with Kanter, Favors, Evans and hell even Biedrins occasionally. You will likely start pretty quickly and you can throw crazy alley-oops to athletic freaks like Jeremy Evans or Derrick Favors. Only bad side is that the bench is pretty weak so you will likely need to be a score first PG."

My guess is that whatever you have written tends to lean more towards the former than the latter. You wouldn't get people all up in your shit if you used the more diplomatic method. Everyone is more than welcome to have their preferences for every aspect of a potential partner, but people are sensitive. Being rude and overtly picky is going to turn off the desirable people too. 






Regarding the titular question, it doesn't matter if people who aren't you are also being dickish and picky with their profile language.

-momoyome-,wemetonline,1389153869.0,"No one has that perfect body. We all have to have realistic expectations about our partners. Underneath our clothes we all probably have something the entertainment industry would call ""unsightly"". My boyfriend is a skinny little twig and has some extra weight in places you wouldn't see nor notice if he wasn't naked. I'm covered in excema from the knee to the ankle and I have large patches on my hands/wrists plus overweight. Bit We have an amazing sex life with the imperfections.  We all cannot be 100% all the time in physical appearance either by poor genetics or just not being able to shake off the extra pounds. But it doesn't make us unattractive people! 

We can control how we perceive ourselves though. Treat yourself respectfully and stand up straight. Head up, shoulders back. It makes a world of difference to those around us. I work with a few heavier girls and they can be even more beautiful than the skinnier ones because they own their bodies and know their strengths. A confident overweight woman can be much more attractive to men than a thin girl that keeps her shoulders hunched and head down. Same can go the other way of course too. I've seen some very attractive dudes that were heavier and not that standard dream boat but their confidence and personality made them drop-dead sexy to me. 

We are not the ones to say so-and-so will not find us attractive because we have extra weight or whatever physical thing you aren't liking about yourself. Take care of your body and maybe buy yourself some new clothes that fit better. Doll yourself up with some accessories and own it.  Remember out of everyone he picked you. Chances are he knows what he's gotten himself into and will love your body no matter what. But first you gotta love your own. "

feastsun,Morrowind,1389153994.0,"There's a readme.html file on the mod package file, which is a long description about the mod. I'll try to quote somepart of it for you:  


* Hunger  
  
You need to eat twice a day. Normally you need to eat at 13:00 for lunch and at 21:00 for dinner, but these hours can be configured. You can eat automatically or manually any food you've in your inventory.  
  
If you can't eat, you get several penalties: burden, weakness to common and blight diseases, reduced health recovery, increased sleep gain and more.  
After too much days without eating, you will die of starvation. You receive a warning message when you have only 1-2 days left.  


* Thirst  
  
You need to drink twice a day. Normally you need to drink at 13:00 for lunch and at 21:00 for dinner, but these hours can be configured.You can drink from wells, water pumps, waterfalls, spouts and other water sources through the game world.  
  
If you can't drink, you get several penalties: burden, weakness to fire, reduced magicka recovery, inability to jump and more.  
After too much days without water, you will die of thirst. You receive a warning message when you have only 1-2 days left.  


* Sleep  
  
You need to sleep in a bed, hammock or bedroll at least 6 hours a day. You may need to sleep more if you are hungry or your fatigue drops to 0 often.  
If you don’t sleep, the scripts apply the penalties in real time, as soon as your sleep value raises above a certain level. These penalties include: burden, fatigue drain, random black-outs, random silence and more. Note that you can sleep during the day and stay up at night, so stealth characters will not be disadvantaged: they'll just have different habits.

She did say a lot about how behind-the-times people were when it came to LGBT things in Japan, and how it was interfering with her work and how she didn't feel comfortable going anywhere but work and home.

It was interesting to me, because a lot of my friends fall somewhere on the gender queer spectrum, and she's always been the kind of person I wish I could be: brash and unapologetic. For her to admit that she really didn't feel like dealing with it, I guess it must have been bad. Kind of put how nice we have it in my big, eclectic city here in America in perspective. "

danhakimi,Android,1389154363.0,"Let's be clear: you can do a *lot* without forking Android. You can replace the Play store and all Google services, you can add custom features like most custom roms have while essentially keeping the same code base... You need to do something *fundamentally incompatible with the operating system* to really *fork* Android.

What I'd do is probably rewrite the dialer and SMS to include Free protocols for data messaging, data calling, and video calling by cell phone number. They'd fall back on SMS/regular calling only when they had to--IE, when communicating with a phone OS that did not support these protocols, or when no data was available. But... I'm not sure that would be enough to qualify as a fork.

I'd include a Free software store, where you can upload your own software to your own servers and do your own thing, and we won't charge you a damn cent. We'd crowdsource removal of malicious software from the listings, but otherwise, it would basically be a web browser with its own protocol and its own format. But... again, that ain't no fork.

I'd re-license my new OS under GPLv3, but... I'd need some real changes to have that be relevant, huh?

I'd... seriously upgrade the camera. But I'm not sure how.

I'd improve default launcher customization options -- it'd be better than Nova. I guess I could ask developers to include custom tags in their software to signify whether it was a game, or for news, or for photos, or whatever, so that the launcher could auto-categorize. That'd be sweet.

Ooh! here's a change, and not just an addition! I'd change the theme of the default icons, and set my own icon guidelines that aren't stupid. It's minor, but I guess it makes it a fork, right? Ya. Totally. Now it's a fork.

And I'd totally upgrade the design for Messaging (and make it look more like hangouts or disa). And I'd upgrade the settings menu, too -- white background, maybe multiple columns or something.

I feel like I have one more big thing, but I can't remember what it is."

feastsun,Morrowind,1389154366.0,"There's some conflicts with other mods. I'll try quote that from the readme file for you:  


* **Complete Morrowind:** The conflict is only with part 1 of the Complete Morrowind mod, the cooking one. According to the reports I received, it seems that some objects (casks, rolling pin, …) are modified by both mods; also, the food cooked with Complete Morrowind is not eaten by NoM scripts. To solve the problem, you can use the modular version of Complete Morrowind without the cooking section.  


* **Carnithus armamentarium:** The food shops in Mournhold collide with the shop added by this mod. To solve the problem, you can move one of the buildings to another spot. Don't simply remove the food shops: they're the only place where you can buy raw foods in Mournhold. There's a mod moving Carnithus' shop to Balmora, making it compatible with NoM. I've not tried it, but it should solve the conflict.  


* **Mods modifying fires (Lights 300, …):** All the fires in game have a script attached to allow you to cook. If you use another mod modifying fires you'll lose the ability to cook near them (if you load NoM before it) or the changes made by the other mod (if you load NoM after it).

I've been researching for the past 2 months or so, reading and watching everything I can get my hands on. And like you say, it's an incredibly rewarding experience, I've learnt so much. I agree also, I've seen many questions from people that by reading one of the links on the sidebar, or a simple google search, would give them the answer they need. 

I get the impression that most people don't know about, or are too lazy to read, all the information freely available and right at their fingertips. They'd prefer to just have someone spoon feed them all the info they need. Building a PC, like many people say, is not difficult. But it does require effort and reading to know what you're doing. And people will be better off by putting in that effort and doing all the hard-work themselves. 

From what I've seen, this is an incredibly welcoming and friendly group on this subreddit. I feel people are more likely to answer questions from people that have obviously put in some effort themselves and just want some extra help, or a second opinion, or help troubleshooting etc.

A year later we opened them together and they said things like ""I know were not over"" and ""I still have hope"". During those 10 months he definitely needed to mature and I, become more independent. 3 and a half years later, we're still as in love as if we first met. "

It's just all easier to get away with if she thinks he's attractive, I'll say that. But if a guy who I initially thought was good-looking came up to me and was tactless, obnoxious, annoying, or whatever, he would lose all attractiveness to me.

This is just my personal opinion, but I, in general, don't really like to be approached by strangers when I'm dining. I think it's easier to do it in a college dining hall as a freshman because everyone is new and eager to make friends, but when I was a freshman, I seemed to only be approached by the creepiest dudes who were incredibly eager to get my number.

 2) Conditioner seems to work well at removing any excess build up, dirt and smell that I have, but yeah, sometimes it still needs a good shampooing. 

Fibers, pastes and gels work well with oil, but beard and mustache waxes tend to get diluted by oil, and won't be as effective. 

u/DirtyRobot had a good idea that I use, he mixes the paste with oil and then puts the mix into his beard.

3) Smells are so subjective, and oils in particular can smell differently to different people.

Buscat,4chan,1389155389.0,"Yeah you're pretty much spot on about compound lifts vs isolation. As for the point of isolation, you actually don't need to do them. If you ever hear of Starting Strength or Stronglifts (SS/SL, and /fit/ talks about them constantly so you probably will), they're strength training programs where you do basically nothing but compound lifts with the barbell. You can work almost every muscle on your body with say, the squat, deadlift, bench press, and pull-ups.

So why does anybody do isolation work at all? Well they're simpler for one thing. Compound lifts tend to have more room for error. I see people doing squats horribly wrong all the time at the gym, so it's not surprising people like that feel like they're getting more out of the machines that isolate their quads. Some people are also intimidated by the barbell. It's pretty embarrassing when you have to bail out of a squat and let the rack catch the bar

Even people who follow routines heavy on compound lifts, though, probably do some isolation stuff anyway. Maybe not the absolute purists, but personally I feel like my compound lifts alone won't get my biceps and forearms big enough, so I bust out some curls after I'm done with the barbell. "

The thing is you don't really need to be so card specific. It is class specific though, you can't really rush with Shaman, Druid or Priest. But if you play any of the other class, if you draft normally, you usually get a decent aggro deck. It's all about the playstyle, instead of favoring board control, you take more risks by going to his face, praying he doesn't have effective removal in his hand.

I mean I was on Skype with a friend the whole time, and he was just dumbfounded by how I was able to get 6 wins with that deck, let alone 12. It had bad draw, it had bad cards, it had no lategame. I only won because I just used the five first turns to run them down to 10 hp, then I just tried to stay alive until I top decked something like arcanite reaper + heroic strike for the finishing blow, since there is so little healing in arena, and most of the taunt creatures are pretty low tier."

I've explored many different structured meditation techniques, ranging from abrahamic-based meditation (islam, judaism, christianity) to the eastern stuff (hinduism, buddhism as my main focus, sikhism, and jainism). I call myself a student of Buddhism now, because that is my focus, but I find that understanding all religion and their practices is very helpful.

Thank you for taking the time to respond! I'm really interested to start tying the native and wiccan/pagan meditations now.. do you have any tips on where to find information on how to practice this stuff? Other than the obvious googling and wikipedia-ing of course.

Oh and the way you described vision quest really reminded me of the sort of deep concentration-based ascetic sort of meditation, which is another reason it interests me so much.

Our teacher was a retired architect and he taught us a lot about the basics of designing residential buildings (houses, really), as well as design methods. These were all hardline drawings with ink on mylar and the perspectives rendered with lead pencil on the back--looks really nice. I also built two models during my time there.

Katterin,cheatatmathhomework,1389156046.0,"Be sure to check that the solutions you get to the quadratic equation actually work as solutions to the original equation, however.

In the first equation, for example, substituting y = 3^x results in    
    (m-1) y^2 + (3m+2) y + (2m-1) = 0

To find the values of m that give exactly one real solution for y, we would need to solve the following:    
    b^2 - 4ac = 0    
    (3m+2)^2 - 4(m-1)(2m-1) = 0

Solving this equation, I get m = 0 and - 24.  Plugging in those values of m and solving the resulting equations for y, I get y = 1 and y = -1.4.  These are real solutions for y.  However, we are looking for real solutions to x.

If y = 1, then 3^x = 1 and x = 0.  If y = -1.4, then 3^x = -1.4 and there is no real solution for x.

Edit: /u/orangejake pretty much implied this step by directing OP to substitute and solve for x, but I just wanted to emphasize that you can't just stop after determining the potential values for m from the quadratic, even though the problem didn't actually ask for x.  You still need to go through the extra steps to be sure x is real after you've determined that y is real."

I went to anything he went to and befriended his friends… at the beginning it was border-line obsessive.

Later on when the fights came and the real-life crap happened we had to stop being silly children in love and decide if we were going to work this through, we ended up breaking up for 10 months and then getting back together when we had matured

However, A year ago we fought *a lot* and he ended up talking to another girl, and we had a big blow out then. It took a lot of time forgiving and trust building. Currently he is 950 miles away at college, yet I have truly never felt more in love with him. He is my best friend, my supporter, my safe haven.

During his teens, before coming out as being attracted to women, he took several years trying to clarify who he was attracted to, which is a much less confusing decision, surely.

For transgender men who do not feel a push to present as male, let alone a push toward hormone therapy and gender reassignment, there is obviously something they see as more important to their life than being out and proud - whether it's positive or not to feel that way, or a temporary thing (like it being important to be absolutely sure) - and therefore live, at a physical/superficial level, as a woman.

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1389156427.0,"&gt;But I don't see how it's ""more fair"".

Nothing is fair in life. Fair is more or less a colloquialism for ""less shallow"" in this context. 

&gt;You're using very extreme examples of promiscuity to assert that there is some kind of Universal TruthTM about promiscuious women that justifies having negative opinions of them.

And I don't think someone being 2 inches shorter than another justifies women having negative opinions about the former either, yet they do...

I was demonstrating a point. I don't think making the point more realistic changes anything about the the premise that fairly accurate generalities can be formed. Change 150 to 20, vs 2, and similar dichotomies remain. 

&gt; 1) the same kind of diagnosis can be made about short men

Which is exactly the point. 

&gt;when you look at more realistic and less ""extreme for the sake of making a point on the internet"", it becomes more difficult to say ""all X who Y are Z.""

Well, first, you've missed the point of my point. As I said earlier, change 150 to something more realistic (even though I do know two women who've had over 100 partners...) to 20 or 30, which is perfectly realistic for a young, decently attractive woman who has an active and avid social life, and you can draw the same general conclusions. 

I mean at the end of the day, the point is not even the armchair psych people can pull on sexually active women, it's the idea that a man fine to deny a woman who's been sexually active a chance. 

I find this topic, out of all topics on reddit, probably the most interseting purely because of the effort women go to to attempt to shame men who do not like their partner counts and how forceful they are in their attempts to validate themselves and their life choices while simultaenously ignoring that their sexual preferences, at least espoused on Reddit are even more unreasonable on the whole. 

Asking for women whom have no more than 5 sexual partners is far more a reasonable demand on the opposite sex than eliminating anyone below 6ft in height a chance at earning my affections. "

Esoteric_Indulgence,TwoXChromosomes,1389156562.0,"I think the first semester of college is a little early to be judging your grades just because college takes some time to adjust to. Some of my general education courses were brutal and I hated going to courses that I had no interest in (I was an art major, so the math class I took my freshman year was like pulling teeth). Once you find your work flow and you start getting into your major courses, it gets better because you're studying things you're passionate about and have a true interest in. 

If this advisor is a professor in your field of study, then it might not be a bad idea to stick with him as your main advisor. I had two advisors at my college, one was called an academic advisor and the other was called a major advisor. The academic advisor was just a random student services employee that changed every year and never really knew you...so I never met with them. The major advisor was a professor in my field of study and it was someone I had classes with all the time and was able to talk to about my workload and future goals. I found my major advisor was more useful and empathetic and I could tell him when I was overworked and stressed and he would help me come up with ways of managing things. So even if you think this professor may have a bad opinion of you, it could definitely change the more that he gets to know you. 

Anyway, glad I could help and I hope that things go well from here. :)"

The pilot called in a bit later and said that there was something wrong with the left gear/engine and that's when it got scary. When you're in a metal coffin that may explode at any moment and maybe doesn't have gear it gets scary. I don't think we had much gas because they didn't circle or anything. When we got closer I think they realized it wasn't that bad because the pilot said that you shouldn't worry about the emergency vehicles that you see on/around the runway. Well, we landed (it was really bumpy, but fine) but as soon as we landed the whole airplane was circled by emergency vehicles and they killed the engines and everything.

Not sure how it works in other countries, but in my country you can organise through school to work (for free) for a company, you can miss up to 6 weeks of school per year if you are on approved work experience. Its the best thing you can do, companies rarely refuse free labour, and you get to see first hand what that industry is like to decide if its right for you. If you hate it, good, you found out before it was too late, if you love it, amazing, talk to as many people as possible, ask them how they got into that role, then plan your pathway.

This is what I am doing now through a rehabilitation service which will help me find employment despite my illness.

Now what on Earth is that wikipedia article being cited for?  How is it relevant?  

Does that article hold the key to Robert Gates' thought process?  

Why not go directly to the source on this.  Like, gee....I don't know....an excerpt from the man's memoirs where you got that quote up there?  

He didn't start the war in Iraq, nor did he encourage it.  Of course he was defending things being done there as he had taken the helm.  What did you expect him to do?  Throw his hands up and say, ""This is a big mess people, we can't handle it!  Whaaa...""  

**No! Because he is a god damned professional hired to do a job.**   Part of that job is to maintain an heir of authority, confidence and calm in his public discourse.  He has to answer to a boss (Bush/Obama) and the final buck doesn't stop with him, he has to follow their lead to a certain degree.  

He says this about two paragraphs later, apparently you didn't read that far.  

&gt;I was brought in to help salvage the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan—both going badly when I replaced Donald Rumsfeld in December 2006. When I was sworn in, my goals for both wars were relatively modest, but they seemed nearly unattainable. In Iraq, I hoped we could stabilize the country so that when U.S. forces departed, the war wouldn't be viewed as a strategic defeat for the U.S. or a failure with global consequences; in Afghanistan, I sought an Afghan government and army strong enough to prevent the Taliban from returning to power and al Qaeda from returning to use the country again as a launch pad for terror. Fortunately, I believe my minimalist goals were achieved in Iraq and remain within reach in Afghanistan.

Was there any decisive moment or time when you realized that the chordal ""sawtooth organ"" sound you've become known for was cemented as your sound in your head?

Basically, if you could sum it up in a few words/sentences, where did the influence to produce more chordal songs like Piranha, Redline and Anaconda come from? Most of Weekend in America and your earlier stuff focused more on heavier, more bassline w/lead focused sounds. Was it to cater to the market of the ""EDM Boom"" or was there a moment where you chose to focus on more chordal music?

Along with that, currently who are your favorite producers and/or the people you think are sticking true to what music is about to you?

dakru,AskMen,1389156911.0,You're getting a few downvotes and I suspect it's because this seems like a generic answer but it really is more true than most of us guys realise.

Maybe we shouldn't entrust life altering decisions to 18 year olds?

Or even better, why don't we, you know, try to change society for the better instead of preaching this gospel of self responsibility ripping people for making bad decisions? Seriously, if anything is rubbing me and the others downvoting you the wrong way, it's that you come in here, condemn us for your decisions, and then handwave any willingness to actually FIX the system to something that actually works as a ""half ***ed utopian ideal.""

If I had to guess you're a republican/libertarian right? You sound like one.

Once again, instead of trying to fix the problem, you're part of the problem, so get out of the way and stop being part of the problem by condemning people with your little gospel of personal responsibility.

Not sure how far through the missions you've gotten, but go to the mission select and sort by 'All"".  This arranges the missions in order of unlock progression (numerically is not the actual progression order).  Work your way through them this way.  You'll start getting a lot more plans and other weapons, as well as good recruits.  The five ""Perfect Stealth"" missions are great for R&amp;D and Intel.

Your first order of business should be Bandanna, Carl-Gustav Fulton, and Fulton Mines.  It sounds to me like you came through the story relatively underlevelled - look up some guides on where the best soldiers are and go through those missions.

In another comment I noticed that you're having trouble with Recruitment because you're on PS3 - the system is slightly different.  Every mission that you do *online* boosts your ""Hotspot"" for the beach recruitment level.  Play online lots - versus or co-op, and then go an recruit.  You'll get way better staff.

I'm on PS3 (though my machine only works at night - it's a hot summer here) so I'd be happy to co-op some of the harder missions and S-Rank them with you if you want to get a headstart on the Bandanna or the M37 and we can work out a time.  Add me up on PSN as FlashMedallion."

Of course, lots of people who identify as gay or otherwise queer have had hetero relationships in the past and truly liked the person(s) they were with. But sometimes you just realize that sort of thing isn't what you prefer. That's okay.

FYI, lots of bi people (ace or otherwise) have a preference for one gender. I've known bi people who were physically attracted to one gender and romantically attracted to another, or who preferred one gender but didn't mind dating or having sex with people who weren't that gender. You don't have to like everyone equally to be biromantic. Really though the label is more about what you're comfortable with and what you want to communicate to other people about yourself, so if you're at the point where you don't really want to be with men then identifying as homoromantic is fine."

Hundreds of fake resumes were submitted to job listings in Boston and in Chicago (results in the two cities were similar). I think the most intriguing findings from this particular study were: Firstly, highly-qualified resumes with white-sounding names had an overall 30% callback-rate advantage over resumes with the same names but lower qualifications, while identical high-qualified resumes with black-sounding names had only an 8% callback-rate increase over resumes with the same names but lower qualifications. Also, for resumes with white-sounding names, having a residential address in a more affluent neighborhood gave a significant increase in callback rates, while, for resumes with black-sounding names, having a residential address in a wealthier neighborhood gave no increase in callbacks whatsoever. These findings really get me thinking about how much people use census-type (categorical) information about race **in combination with** other pieces of biographical information to build simplistic and inaccurate narratives about both imaginary and actual human beings.

tl;dr winning a division with a poor record does not in any way imply that a team's division or schedule was tough. "

Unlike sexuality, being passive assigns you a gender, rather than a question mark. Gender ambiguity is something you opt into, whereas you (unless horrible things happen) get time to define your sexuality.

I don't call my roommate a woman, outside of the odd accidental pronoun misuse in speech because I'm rewriting 16 years of brain wiring - which is the main issue for his brother, my fiance, as well (except that it's 24 years for him).

came0,AskWomen,1389157675.0,"To start, I had a crushing feeling around my head and shoulders so I sat down. I then blacked out but during the black out I walked over to the grass (I was outside when it happened). I lost consciousness and woke up a second later on the ground wondering what happened.

My son was outside with me during all this so he tried to help me up but I couldn't get my leg to do what I wanted it to do (get under me, support my weight, and face the right direction). So he helped me lay down in the grass. That's when my mom was going to drive me to the hospital, but I told them to call 911.

About that time is when the pain hit, but I've blocked most of that out. I remember the paramedics showing up and asking questions. They put me in a neck brace and strapped me to a back board. I remember every movement hurt. Then I was at the hospital.

I was in ICU for 3 weeks then regular room for 2 days. I recovered at home for another 8 weeks before being allowed to return to work. I was very lucky. My recovery has been quick and nearly complete.

This all happened in April of 2013. I still have a few minor cognitive issues I notice but tests show my brain working at above average levels so the doctors aren't concerned. I know it's happening though so it's frustrating."

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1389157789.0,"From what I can see, most people don't see much use in this sub for gay men. Namely for two reasons:

One, most people here are straight and discuss intersex relationships.

Two, most people here probably don't even know where to begin. Gay relationships have too many intricacies that most here aren't prepared for. E.g. As a gay guy, your exes can hook up. This doesn't tend to happen to straight men unless they happened to have hooked up with a couple of bisexual girls. Also, while a straight guy might hide his interest for someone out of shyness or lack of confidence (betadom), until a gay guy comes out of the closet and is well-connected within an LGBT community he has a lot more pressure to keep quiet about his sexual interests. He could get called out. He could get disowned. A lot of real shit could come to pass.

Those are just a couple of the many reasons that even I can come up with (but have little experience dealing with).

However, I see it differently. There are deeper underlying philosophies supporting TRP that I can see working for gay guys too. My first introduction to some RP-like thinking actually came from a gay roommate who went through a jaw-dropping transformation. I don't know if it was meds, meditation, an epiphany, whatever, but between high school and college, he completely changed. Stopped giving a fuck. Came out of the closet. Became one of the most popular and loudest people at my college dorms. 

It amazed me (and disgusted me too, at the time, because...): He could be as rude and inconsiderate as all Hell, and people would still love him. I owe a good chunk of my social life in college to him.

Think about many of the shaming that outcast males face. It's often sexual in nature. ""Virgin"". ""Deviant"". The social shaming against gay males is even more so, by nature, sexual. 

Mentally getting over that hurdle is a shared struggle. Coming out of the closet for gays, I've always thought seemed like a big **""fuck you""** to social norms while embracing their sexuality for better or worse. Seems a lot like what many guys here are doing. If you ignore how this embracing of sexuality is actually implemented, there is some similarity there.

So an emphatic ""No"" from me. I don't think TRP and gay people are mutually exclusive. The big problem is that most people here are not gay, and seem very focused on the intersexual aspect, it's harder to frame things in a way that sounds relevant to gay men.

Your individual points:

1.
&gt; If you're gay, you're not targeting women, so do many of the theories of hypergamy, etc. not apply?

This is [hypergamy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergamy): Hypergamy (colloquially referred to as ""marrying up"") is the act or practice of marrying someone of higher caste or status than oneself.

That's all it is. You'll notice that the wiki link even states that it's typically used by social scientists to refer to women marrying higher-status men. This isn't a forgone conclusion, but the results of various studies. 

[Here is one of them, which discusses the socioeconomic mobility of men vs women.](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/cdewp/81-5.pdf) Summarily, men are more likely to experience *occupational mobility* whereas women are more likely to experience *marital mobility*. They cause and compliment each other. 

E.g. Men more likely to advance through occupation than women, so women play catchup by marrying up. Men see that women prefer to marry up, so they struggle to advance further. The cycle continues.

As per the article, like a free market, this ends up balancing out that both sexes end up having roughly equal chances of upwards socioeconomic mobility.

There's not enough to say which is causing the other to a greater degree.

There are many other ways to see hypergamy around the world. Check sex ratios of cosmopolitan metropolises around the world. Check estimated mail-order brides vs mail-order husbands. (Note, I'm not saying which gender is at ""fault"" for this or whether this is ""fair"". That is irrelevant right now.)

None of this makes sense from the context of gay relationships, and it would be significantly more difficult to get good stats for. How would we dichotomize gay men? Bears vs flamers? Where to even begin...

Intersex is a much easier study than intergender, and in turn easier than... intrasex. 

So no, I don't think that in particular applies.

2.
&gt; Alpha/Beta. If you consider yourself to be an Alpha, do you have to pursue Betas?

No clue here. I do personally know some gay men who decry that there aren't enough manly gay men for them. IIRC, a couple bi guys in this sub talked about the same thing. That's about it.

3.
&gt; Long-term relationships? I know they're not generally approved of here, but bear with me. Do you go for the Beta guy? Is there going to be a constant power struggle?

Hard to know how gay people generally handle this here. I don't think LTR's are that frowned upon though."

arcticfox00,AskReddit,1389157811.0,"Honestly, it's not as big a difference as I had imagined.

It's more like, if I act more stereotypically feminine now (smiling, talking to people all happy-like, whatever), the response I get is really warm and everyone is really open to me and whatnot.

I was sorta 'that gay-ish kid' in middle school, and was really ostracised for acting femininely, and I'm just now getting comfortable with it again (in college). People aren't mean to me when I act that way now. Also, I tend to be a lot more afraid of men/older teenage boys (basically my age group). It's not as bad like out in the city in the daytime, but even when I'm with a group of friends at someone's house and there's guys I don't know, I'm a little afraid of them.

reyrey1492,AskMen,1389157813.0,"I do indeed. I met her in early 2010 when I was leading auditions for one of the performing groups at my local renaissance festival. I was 19, she was 15 at the time. When I first met her I thought she was just some other kid I'd have to put up with. 

Well, during the audition process that opinion didn't change a whole lot, but I did get to know her better and found her to be at least tolerable. In May I wound up leaving the group for personal reasons, but all of my roommates at the time were still part of the group. Due to that she was over quite frequently for rehearsals and other various promos and events.

Got to know her better and found she was actually pretty cool and a really talented performer. Fast forward through to fall and the festival season passes by with much sadness for me. At the end of the run she decides she's gonna have a Wii dance party and invites all the people from festival that she knows as well as some friends from her school.

I'm the only one from festival that shows up. From there we decide it was a great idea to have a weekly Glee night. (Shutup, I can be a 12 year old girl if I want) We'd take turns cooking and then watch Glee and hang out every week. It was awesome. We did that for two years before our lives got too busy to be able to meet up every week.

She's halfway through her senior year and deciding on colleges so she's constantly busy. I work full time and have a pretty tight schedule with everything I do after work. It makes me sad that I don't get to see her as regularly or often as I used to. Right now I have that privilege about once a month. Usually I'll go over and cook for her and her mom or take them out to dinner somewhere.

We've always been there for each other and I don't see that changing. She's almost like my little sister and her mom is my second mom. Neither of us really have much of a father figure. It's awesome having someone who I can talk to about anything and everything. There are some subjects I won't bring up yet, though. One of them being exactly how important she is in my life. She is one of the three people I decided to live for when I was *this* close to ending it last year.

She doesn't know about that part yet, but before she goes off to college she will.

She's the best friend anyone could hope to have. Our relationship is weird and hard to really explain, but it works for us. She's family. She's the best."

Strange as it may sound, it seems like that sort of setup may actually work more efficiently if you are using a LESS efficient pellet stove as I think that such designs rely on the mass catching enough heat to make the inside of the exhaust tube hot enough to combust the rest of the combustible gases given off by the burning material.  It's a pot-shot theory but it seems like a lot of the modern 80%+ efficiency rating pellet stoves wouldn't give off enough heat in the exhaust to get it up to critical temperature, however the mass would still absorb and slowly radiate most of whatever heat is left after the initial burn process.  I'm no expert on this though, that's just my two cents.  Upside: you can probably get less-efficient, older-model pellet stoves dirt cheap at the onset of the warmer weather seasons.  I've also seen a couple of videos of some interesting hybrid woodstove/rocket mass systems which worked pretty efficiently but not quite as efficiently as a stove which was made specifically to be rocket-mass only.  I could see dead-fall meeting your needs from 6 acres if you did the rocket-mass thingy but I don't think it would be enough long-term if you stick with a standard wood-stove.  You'd probably be OK for at least a decade or two though.  Last figure I heard was that if one is looking for long-term wood supply for life, it takes about 20 acres of well-managed woodlot to sustain an average-sized household using a standard wood-stove."

macgillweer,Parenting,1389158190.0,"My wife and I have had two miscarriages since our first child was born.  They were horrible. We were bursting to tell everyone, and did.  Having to go back and correct people who thought we were still expecting was bad, seeing the pity and sadness in other people's eyes was worse.  Hearing somebody ask my wife ""How's that baby doin'?"" was heart-wrenching.

Things would go great for about six weeks, then she'd get these terrible cramps and bleeding.  The first one was bad, the second was worse when she realized it was happening again.  Crying jags and trips to the doctor followed, and she got deeply depressed, almost to the point of not wanting to try anymore.

I would tell my family immediately.  Even if its a failed pregnancy, they should know and can help you if things don't work out.  Wait until you see the sonogram before letting the cat out.  In the words of our doctor, ""If you see the heartbeat, there's a 95% survival rate.""

When we finally did see that heartbeat, there were some manly tears in that little room.  Our second son is due in March, and we're already planning what kind of shitty pickup to buy him when he turns 16."

GreatWhite000,trance,1389158239.0,"I've been whipping up an uplifting track the past week, nothing much to it so far, but here's a screenshot of the bassline, made following Gelardi's Uplifting Trance Bassline tutorial: http://i.imgur.com/FdzbC8P.png

You basically have to listen to each bass (and maybe play the kick along with it) and adjust it's volume accordingly so that it doesn't drown out the other sounds (and other basses). I've done that here to the point where I could add in each bass 1 at a time and you would be able to tell when it changes. 

I might also add that to reduce repetitiveness, you'll want to add something in every 8 bars (you probably knew that). And if you want to make a better kick, take multiple nice sounding kick samples (I will add Vengeance Essential Clubsounds Punchy Kick 001 to a lot of other kicks to make something that sounds nice) and just play around with the volume.

Here's my first track. First track I ever mixed, mastered, and spent a great deal of time on. The bass gets a bit muddy at parts, and the track itself can get repetitive, but you eventually have to give up and move on to new projects. :)

I can't run longer developing routes against a blitz so I'm forced to run quick routes which are easy to stop if you know what you're doing or have five people in the general vicinity of where linebackers play. Hooks were a no go, outs were a no go because the CBs had good man coverage all game and buzz zones beat both of the previous routes, slants were a no go because they were entering a fucking hive of defensive players in the middle, streaks were generally a no go unless a certain set of coverages were ran, comebacks were a no go, screens didn't work either, running in general didn't work except like two or three players where Richardson just broke tackles but that ceased pretty quickly when he fumbled, read option was a no go because 9 men in the box leaving one guy dedicated to the QB and one to the HB. Flat routes worked early on but then flat zones were called in conjunction with buzz zones or hook zones.

Yes. It has to fester from inside. Seething, bubbling, brewing. Slowly gaining mass. Little by little it has to fill you up. You have to be so full of it you can taste the bitter bile every time a woman takes out her cell phone. It has to make you so constipated that one day, after some slut dared talking to you like she was your equal, and blinded by how mad that makes you, you just can't help but finally take your inane rambling to an internet forum filled with others like you, and then. Then, fellow pillards, the shit lavine can finally begin. You will have gone off at the deep end. Then you can finally throw up your bitterness in raw quantities. And that's the story of how I became alpha. TRP is such a positive influence.

PS no, what are you talking about, I'm not bitter, I love women^('s holes, AM I RIGHT GUYS)."

Just because he's taking some time to gather his thoughts doesn't mean that he's not ""dealing with it like an adult"". Let him take what comfort he can in booze and cigarettes; as long as he doesn't make it a lifetime habit of it, it's not a big deal. 

Also, the primary/secondary thing works for quite a few poly people. The labels are unfortunate, but regardless of what words are used, it's a functional model for many of us. Not everyone is set up to have multiple primaries; people fit into different parts of our lives. Some people can all live together and make the multiple primary thing work, but not everyone chooses to live that way. It doesn't make it any less valid a relationship choice. "
oldmonty,AskMen,1389158525.0,"I was banned from askwomen for telling a mod I was just trying to help the OP in the thread, who was in the process of freaking out about her boyfriends behavior, and asking why the mod wasnt doing something about the 2-3 people who wanted to hijack the thread to debate game of thrones with me. 

Apparently the mod agreed with their game of thrones opinion.  

I've had several posts/comments censored for arbitrary reasons before that, if it suits them they will quote the most obscure line of their rules which is listed as ""suggested practice"" (its actually listed below ""make sure you use flair"" and I dont see them banning people that dont have flair) and enforce it like its rule #1 and if it suits them they will ignore the rules completely and if you say well I havent broken any rules they will yell at you to not discuss moderation policy within a thread and if you pm them they will all get together to bitch at you about how dare you question their authority or something. That last part I actually heard from a girl who pm'ed them, never having done so myself. Its easy to say they are sexist, and from my point of view it certainly seemed that way, but based on conversations with other female redditors who have had similar experiences I'd say they are just total assholes on a perpetual power-hungry tie raid. Just because they got the most catchy women-answer subreddit name before anyone else and not because they were elected or are in any way qualified to do that job. 

There was one case, for example, where the OP was having trouble with insomnia, a problem I've been dealing with for 10+ years. There were a lot of logically good suggestions like ""drink some tea before bed"" or ""get a better pillow"", the kind of stuff that makes sense in your head and you wont realize how wrong you are until you actually go through it. People have been telling me this kind of stuff the whole time I've had this problem, mind you, but none of it works because it doesnt addresses the root issue. So I started my post like this: ""there are some very good suggestions on here but unfortunately none of these actually work, Ive tried them all and while they make sense when you think about them they dont address the key issue"". 

Apparently I was ""Invalidating a woman's opinion"" and my post was removed, even though my statement wasnt directed at any one person and thats not really a rule. I could have edited my comment but by the time I was notified the thread was so old and crowded my actual solution wouldnt have made it through the slurry of well-intentioned non-solutions. To this day I still worry about that poster and if she actually found a way to do something about her issue. 

Im not in these ""ask and answer"" subs for the karma, I couldnt give less of a shit, but the thought that there's someone somewhere that is dealing with some crap I could help with is motivational to me, if they want me to post its going to be me posting. Im not going to let people censor me and act as if they are doing me a service. The posters on a sub provide the content and the community, the mods are just serving kind of a janitorial function, preventing spam and abuse, they shouldnt dictate how the content is presented. Like when they told me using the phrase ""I dont want to seem like a dick"" was a gendered slurr, when in reality thats just the way I talk. "

evilbrent,confession,1389158878.0,"Guess what?

They've had sex on it too.

And on your couch.

And on the floor of the kitchen.

And in the hall.

And in the shower.

And on your back steps.

And in the car.

And when you were a baby they had sex when you were in the room, in fact they probably stopped mid-coitus to pat you back to sleep. When you were in your mum's belly your dad fucked her and the tip of his penis was banging on your head.

...................... Just trying to say that your parents have been there and done that. They've fucked on THEIR parents bed when they were your age. When they left their teenager alone in the house while they went away they HOPED that their bed wouldn't get fucked in, but they knew that it was a possibility.

If it makes you feel any better they'll just say ""Ew GROSS"" and change the sheets. As long as the first thing you say to them is ""I'm sorry I made a terrible mistake"" it should be ok. I mean - say that they were letting relatives sleep over at their house in the spare room (or using the master bed if they were away or something) there's no way that they would expect that sex wouldn't at least be a possibility: which is another way of saying that they've absolutely changed other people's fucksheets before.

You'll be fine. Come clean. Don't do it again, that's gross. Fuck in the park like normal kids."

sockalicious,changemyview,1389159226.0,"Being prochoice is fine - I happen to be myself.

But getting up on a soapbox about ""control of one's own body"" is a silly way to justify it.

Let's take the hypothetical example you used - a suffering person dying of leukemia, and a fellow with compatible marrow who could save him if he chose to undergo a mildly painful hour long procedure that would do not permanent harm.

Sure.  We don't force the guy with the lifesaving marrow to donate his marrow.

That leaves the guy with leukemia a few more hours, maybe a day or two, to retain control of his body.  Then he spikes a fever of 110 degrees, becomes delirious, lapses into a coma and dies.  After that he has no control of his body whatsoever, for a very long time indeed.  It is almost as devastating as childbirth!

It's all very well and good to say people should always have control over their body, especially if you're 9 years old and believe in flying unicorns.  To you, I suggest that you spend a few dozen hours candy-striping in your local hospital.  You will come away understanding just how tenuous that illusion of control really is.  And then you'll need a better argument to make in favor of the position you've already decided on.

[You are honestly gonna argue that GB is better than SF because of a subjective strength of schedule? Everyone plays 8 homes games and 8 road games. The league schedules are all made equal](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1uo7qk/goodell_on_reseeding_the_playoffs_based_on_record/cek72y2).

It's a reasonable argument: an NFL team is an NFL team, we all play 8 home, 8 road, and there's truly only marginal differences of a play or two per game between good teams and bad teams.

If your tooth was becoming infected you would likely be experiencing fever, hot swelling flesh around the break, and foul breathe.

Its very common to get leakage when coughing if you've been activley coughing for several days. sadly there is no quick fix, Incontinence liners are your only option in the short term, but now you know that you are prone to stress leakage you can start training yoyr pelvic floor to avoid this problem in the future. [here](http://www.continence.org.au/pages/pelvic-floor-muscle-exercises-for-women.html) is some information on pelvic floor strengthening, its important to get the technique right to avoid creating problems like spasm or hyperactive sphincter.

I've seen other people go through it too.

I remember my teacher gave an example of a new stomach medication (I fail to remember what it was but let's say that for now) that passed drug trials and went into common usage but suddenly a few patients started dying from sudden heart stop and it was immedeatly suspended until we knew what was going on. It turns out that in drug trials we can only test the medication on so many people (In the final trials there are usually thousands of patients) and even though we perform exhaustive tests it might be that the 10 000th patient may have a very serious side effect. And from a medical point of view it isn't acceptable to prescribe a drug that seriously hurts or kills 1 in 10 000 patients so there is a lot of careful follow up studies when introducing new drugs.

I understand your frustration. It's hard to see something like that happening and know that other people are going to take it and use it to hold up their own bigotry. The thing you need to remember is that *it doesn't matter* what we do, those kind of people are *never* going to be on our side. Furthermore, I don't see why we should hold ourselves to some unreachable standard of Perfect Minority Representative at all times. 

Let them do them. If you want to make sure that our rights are protected, you have to let them do that. Because to force them to do otherwise is...well, not too different than what the foaming mouthed bigots want to do to us.

I've been really suicidal the last week, and heart issues are in both sides of the family. 

I thought I was dying, so I gritted my teeth, sat down in my recliner and waited to die. Wanting it to be over. Wondering how long it would be before someone would find me. Weeks? Months? When I didn't, it was too late to go to a store and buy a gun, and I'd already tried cutting into myself with a knife, and it hurts too much, and poison never interested me. That left hanging, and as laughable as it is, I can't tie a knot to save my life. All those years in the boy scouts and nothing to show for it. I washed my evening dose of meds with vodka and didn't stop until I was almost incoherent. It's the closest I have to poison. 

It's not the first time I've done this. But last night was the closest I've really hungered for death in a while. There are a lot of times lately I just want to just... stop. I'm just so very very weary. "

I used to save my favorite part of the meal for last. Cereal? Ill save the marshmallows for last. Like the fries? eat the burger first and save the fries for last. 

Now I HAVE to eat what I like first or else, I won't finish the favorite part. Silly I know, but it took some practice to realize it. Also, if I eat my favorite part first, it's easier for me to stop when I am full (but the plate is not empty) than if I ate my favorite part last. If I LOVE rice and dislike corn, if I eat the corn, then the rice, I've eaten my whole plate. If I eat the rice first, then I can stop myself easier once I'm full, if I'm in the middle of eating corn, which I am not to crazy about.

I don't think they would intake a high enough dose of nicotine to kill them from a smoker.  Assuming a blood-nicotine level of 30ng/ml, and a serving size of 0.01ml, you're only looking at about 0.3ng of nicotine being ingested.  

The LD50 of nicotine in mice is 3 mg/kg, or 3 ng/mg.  A mosquito weights, on average, around 2.5mg.  So assuming the LD50 is similar, it would take around 7ng of nicotine to kill it.

The reason you hear people saying its ""less effective"" or ""not working"" is when you talk specifically about birth control as a hormonal treatment. Over time your body can start wavering its natural hormone production or perhaps develop a tolerance or intolerance to the artificial hormones. This can cause a change in side effects or a breakthroigh of pre-existing conditions the pill had once fixed.

At no point does the pill stop working or become less efficuiant as a method of contraception, It will always protect you from pregnancy to its fullest as long as you take it as directed.

But if you are taking the pill in order to manage symptoms like pain or PMS, and after several years you start getting pain again, then its fair to say your pill is ""less efficient"" at what *you* want it to do, and this does happen. Sometimes taking a break from the pill for several months then starting again can help, sometimes swapping to a different progetein component can help, sometimes you need to up the oestrogen dose. Its worth talking to your doctor about if its bothering you.

But in short. The pill does not become less effective as a contraception over time."

I fantasize about quitting work all the time, because I rationalize that it will take away my stress. However, I don't have panic attacks. 

&gt; but a huge contributor to me not even beginning doing something is if I foresee that it won't go exactly right, or that I won't be perfectly prepared for it, I find it much more difficult to motivate myself to do it.

That is exactly how I feel about any and all projects I start. Glad to know I'm not the only one. Also, I know what you mean about the phone issue. I had to pep talk myself to return a simple phone call today. Behaving this way makes me feel lazy and pathetic, yet I can't seem to stop. Do you find that anything that could be the least bit difficult, you just completely avoid until it turns into a worse problem for you? I do this constantly. To top this off, I have ADD and it's hard for me to pinpoint if my lack of motivation is from that or depression. Sorry for rambling, I just feel like I can relate to you."

cunctatrix,AskWomen,1389160508.0,"(Heads up - like in previous posts, I tend to use the ""general you"" a lot; I'm not talking about you personally when I use ""you"".)

I mean, the short answer is that when someone says ""no"" or expresses a desire to be left alone, you have to respect that. No one is entitled to anyone else's time or attention. No one is entitled to get a chance to be known better, or to prove themselves beyond their first impression. It doesn't matter if she doesn't really know who you are, or if she's judging you based on appearances only - that's fully her right to do so. To keep pressing against her wishes disrespects that right and disrespects her.

Yes, there's an information asymmetry, but it works both ways. The woman doesn't know much about who the man is, but he also doesn't really know anything about what she wants in a partner. Chances are, if she's rejecting him even just on the basis of first impressions, she has a reason. And clearly that reason is important enough that she doesn't think it's worth getting to know you - that anything else you could have to offer would not outweigh whatever she's not liking. That reason could be anything. Maybe she just doesn't want a relationship right now. Maybe she doesn't find you physically attractive - and believe me, it's not going to work if there's not some level of mutual attraction there. It could be something like you're wearing a cross necklace and she's an adamant atheist. It might even be something as ""stupid"" as you wearing a tee-shirt from a band she hates. Whatever the reason, *it doesn't matter what it is, or how silly or stupid you might think it is. All that matters is that it's important enough to her that likely nothing else will override it.*

I imagine you might argue that, with something like the band tee, she's being closed-minded and should be able to see that personality compatibility is ultimately more important than music preferences. While I'd agree on that last bit, the thing is that you are not going to be able to change her mind. What we value and seek out is something very personal that takes time to change - someone telling us to change them and look beyond appearances isn't going to make us do an automatic 180. And when you're disregarding someone's clear expression of disinterest and disrespecting their desire to be left alone, you're basically destroying any influence you might have possibly had on them (provided they're well-adjusted, sane people). Besides, for all you know, maybe this girl isn't looking for something serious, maybe all she wants is someone to fuck and cuddle while sharing a love for the same music, and so band preferences really is important to the dynamic she's looking for. You honestly don't know. But if she's rejecting you, then chances are very good - for whatever reason - that it wouldn't work out.

If you're suggesting allowing someone to get to know you in a more passive way, like staying open to contact with them, staying friendly acquaintances, etc, then that's fine if they are also okay with that arrangement. But continuing to hit on someone, ask her on dates, etc when she's said no? That's like the dating equivalent of non-consent; it's obvious she doesn't want it but you (again, *general* you) keep forcing it on her anyway.

Also, when women have ""multiple suitors"" as in multiple guys who want to date them, they don't have to date just one. Dating isn't automatically or necessarily exclusive - even when it leads to relationships, it serves as a more casual, non-committal first step that allows parties to get to know one another. So if a woman really is interested in two guys and wants to get to know them better, she can date both as long as neither is insisting upon exclusivity. Sure, that choice might come up at some point, but you'll still generally have a chance to get to know someone more before you jump right into a exclusive relationship (if you both want to get to know each other more, that is). (Granted, maybe some people want to be exclusive from the first date, and if that's what you want that's valid, just don't be surprised if people turn you down more often because they're not comfortable making that sort of commitment to someone they don't know very well yet).

One last footnote - if someone is expressing disinterest based on a first impression for what you perceive to be ""shallow"" reasons, do you really want to be with them? (Probably not.) It also definitely doesn't feel good to be with anyone who you have to ""convince"" to be with you, or to overlook things about you that you're otherwise totally content with and may even like about yourself... you should be with someone who's able to appreciate all sides of you."

sheenathepunkrocker,TumblrInAction,1389160529.0,"Thank you, that was wonderful! I'm a female fan of the series (ok so maybe just because it was a show my little brother watched that didn't annoy me), and while I did notice a lack of characters with female names, it never bothered me too much because, well they're trains.  Plus I share a name with one of the newer trains, Emily, so I still felt totally included :) I also thought they were good stories, with characters that had flaws that kids could either identify with, or learn from, which in my opinion is better than having an annoying show like Dora the Explorer with a female protagonist.  It is, after all, possible to identify with characters that you don't share the same gender or race with (something that I think SJWs sometimes lose sight of).  The Thomas books are part of the list of books I plan on reading to my future kids, regardless their genders.  

On a somewhat unrelated note, the Thomas the Tank Engine wooden train sets are some of the best toys ever.  My mom and I used to make elaborate tracks with my brother's sets, either on the table we had for that purpose, or on the floor if they got too large.  Then my brother and I would have hours of fun driving his ever-growing collection of engines, cars, coaches and other vehicles around the track."

- Overpriced, old housing. Not many affordable buildings with amenities

- Not much green space, except some small community gardens and Tompkins Sq Park

The person carrying a large knife is more likely to stab you than the person carrying a bag of pasta. (In this metaphor, the knife is a penis. Heh. I'm kind of proud of myself for that.)
B) How many times have you had consensual sex with a stranger in a dark alley and then, whoops! found out she was a minor. Sorry, your argument does not apply in this context. This isn't a statement about women who are afraid of their male acquaintances by virtue of their gender. (And really, is that even a thing?

No, they stay and they work on the people. They're now running 14 or 16 hours into an 8 hour shift. But all the roads are closed. So now they're running 20 hours into an 8 hour shift. They sleep when they can, they work when they have to, and people keep piling in and there's nothing they can do but just sit there and deal with it.

Jobs that are considered ""vital"" are not jobs where you can just say, ""I'm tired, I'm going home."" You work in those professions because you are passionate about what you do. So you are signing up for shit hours and you know it and expect it and you either can handle it or you get the fuck out.

If you're going in for a planned surgery/routine thing you're going to have a well-rested doctor. It's only ER and residents that are that tired.

So yeah, you're going to have tired nurses and doctors from time to time. Shit happens. They can't be prepared for every single outcome. If you have a hospital that normally has an ER staff of 12 and suddenly you are flooded with 50 patients because of some outbreak or disaster, well, that's tough. You're going to have to work and work until you clear that shit out. Even if they call in everyone that's on-call, you're still going to be there for a long time.

kuma_k,todayilearned,1389161127.0,"Unfortunately for Nintendo, their crappy hardware isn't the problem anymore.  The biggest challenge they have to face is they refuse to develop as a 3rd party for other consoles, while all other developers *have* to focus on developing for next-gen (PS4/XB1).  This makes porting over to the WiiU a massive headache.  Usually, *something* has to change in a pretty significant way, more so because of their awful controllers, but their lack of power is plenty important.

The way I see it, Nintendo is only hurting itself by scaring off any 3rd party developers.  Likewise, they also largely reduce their own playerbase, because we have less reason to buy *their* console.  The only reason I can't justify buying a WiiU is because the 2 or 3 games I want for it are not a good enough reason.  Especially being a console, it needs to hold the test of time.  At the very least, it needs to keep me playing for a good 5 years.

Of course, I'm also a huge advocate of Nintendo going 3rd party, rather than exclusive to their own hardware.  Never gonna happen though.  I'm not a doomsayer in the slightest, I don't think Nintendo is going anywhere, especially with their 3DS, I just think their strategy is stupid (for their home consoles anyway).

onionnion,Anxiety,1389161152.0,"It seems the community clinic in my town could help her. Her only concern is her mom finding out, though because absolutely no one knows how she'd respond, but we have an idea: she's ranted in front of her a few times about people who cut, saying how it's ""disgusting"" and all that typical ignorant stuff. The physical abuse is more past (recently it's mostly been constant fighting/yelling inside the house), so more verbal abuse than anything. Coincidentally, her mom (the main abuser; also, her dad is really nice but lives some 2-3 hours away) recently got put on antidepressants for her own depression and I'm hoping this will help the overall situation. However, my girlfriend seems to be almost begging for help at times, and it worries me.

She often sleeps over at her aunt's (who's wonderful) to get away from the issues at home and I'm thinking she could help her. Again, the only concern is about her mom. Would she block any help? Say there's no problem and just say no? Freak out? We don't know.

Also, Child Protection Services in our area is absolutely terrible. There are 3 close people to me (her including) where they've gotten involved and have done absolutely nothing helpful; if anything, they've just put the parent/guardian through a class of ""don't do this, m'kay?"" material. One friend has run away many times with the police not believing her saying her own mother just strangled her and just took her back home, but things have gotten better for her since her parents broke up.

Anyways, thanks for that link, I had no idea that clinic near me had this type of support. I'll probably give them a call tomorrow (Wednesday) and see if/how they can assist."

You can argue that he has no legal right to do so, but that doesn't affect the actual outcome one whit. He felt betrayed by the social contract he was born under and felt no particular obligation to adhere to his end of it after having his life utterly ruined over a triviality. With no legal recourse against a system headed by an unelected absolute monarch, he set out (and succeeded for over a decade) to live his life as an independent agent, albeit one with powerful enemies.

The contract he offered was one between equals, Valjean as his own representative, Javert as a representative of the State. And make no mistake, Javert was empowered to use his discretion on his investigations - he acted relatively independent of higher command throughout the entire fiction. He just chose not to accept Valjean's offer out of personal prejudice and an inflexible approach to bureaucracy. A jobsworth, basically. There was certainly a compromise to be made there - he could volunteer to accompany Valjean on his errand and bring him in afterwards. That would require little trust on his part and only a small delay."

All hormonal birth controls carry a risk of DVT, PE, stroke and Clots. Progesterone-only methods have a much, much lower risk. But sadly this is the price we pay for being reliably child free.

The higher the oestrogen dose, the worse it can be. anything over 35µg is generaly considered a high dose, though some 30µg brands are just as notorious.

My mother was on Nordette, commonly known for its high stroke risk despite being a medium dose. I was also on Nordette. It was a miracle pill for me, it managed my endometriosis and my fibromyalgia and my migraine disorder. in 2011 my mother had a clot in her lower right calf, and PE. She was pulled from her pill, and 6 months later, I was taken off mine, against my will, because I can't legally be prescribed estrogen now that there is a family history.

Personally: I lift weights.  I consider myself above average in attractiveness.  I make a solid effort to take care of my body, and I want the same in a partner.  I don't think it's shallow or asking too much.  Furthermore, I am especially physically attracted to the body type of a guy who also lifts weights (especially 'bearmode', swoon).  I do not care about body fat % or defined abs - I care about strength and having a fun healthy fitness habit in common with a partner.  I want to be able to be tossed around like a rag doll, and since I'm 6' tall and muscular that's hard to come by!

So, you can be a weight lifter and have loose skin.  You're 6'2"" - height is attractive - but 190 sounds on the lighter side of what I find attractive (I like the big boys).  Loose skin is unattractive to a degree - but not on it's own unattractive enough to matter, especially if weighed against someone who otherwise is funny, smart, and I have things in common with.  But if it is something that makes you insecure, that's unattractive.

Then she would start looking for reasons for it not to work out again. After a couple of times, I just told her I needed to focus on getting myself into a better place personally. She was great, and I was very attracted to her, it just became very clear that we were in two very different places in life, and I didn't want to feel like I was pursuing things in my life in hopes of impressing her or trying to keep her around. It was very much the right decision for me, and she didn't get ""boring"", it just came down to asking myself ""is this for me, or is this for her?"", and for the first time in my life, I decided that I needed to be a better person for myself, and not to do it to try to convince someone I was a better person.

AnimusHerb240,occult,1389161808.0,"I have participated in a past life regression/Reiki session.

""Is it '**real**'? Am I really '**remembering**' something from an 'actual' past life?"" Not a helpful/important line of questioning. At the very least one can consider it yet another narrative-avenue for exploring inner space. And don't let the ""yet another"" distinction lend a sense of *arbitrariness-in-the-face-of-infinite-narrative-avenues*, because ""Past Life Regression"" is indeed a very particular point of perspective among a finite number of them that will ever make sense, and it is very accessible.

**Do you get the impression that there may be something to be gained, no matter how meager, by exploring the visions of your own past lives?**

The little needle on your internal yesnometer will wiggle a little bit and tip towards ""Yes"" or tip towards ""No"".

**If it wiggles a little bit towards ""Yes"",** call your attention to your inner film projector screen and behold the flash of a point-of-view image—maybe just a black and white still image, maybe a 2 or 3 second looping animated GIF, maybe a several-minute-long segment of silent film, maybe a vivid 3D IMAX shot complete with smell-o-vision.

What appears in the image will seem oddly foreign and yet familiar at the same time. Can you settle into a real sense of experiencing that POV scene firsthand? Even if only slightly? It may take revisiting the scene several times over the course of days or months to become more familiar with it. If your experience of it is indeed more lucid than passive, take a second to ""look down at your feet."" Are ""you"" remaining still, or in transit to somewhere? What are you doing there? Where are you supposed to be? You may find answers to these questions flash in your mind just as easily as that initial image did, in a similar fashion.

I tend to think of the real truth of reincarnation as a tree of tangential points of consciousness...your own familiar life being the main trunk, with several branches of varying ""thickness"" intertwining, branching off, intersecting at points relevant to your particular situation. You are a five year old girl who dies in a terrorist attack in the year 2044, and that is important because of something someone said to you yesterday. You are a chemosynthetic bacterium navigating the 400°C waters of a hydrothermal vent, and that is relevant to you because of some lesson you are in need of learning to further your career. Or maybe those are for me, and yours are quite different.

This I describe in contrast to the colloquial **""after I die, I'll come back as a""** concept, which falls prey to thinking of birth/death/time in a limited linear fashion, and possibly also to the idea of the whole affair being linked to some form of ""karmic punishment"" (i.e. he was an asshole, so a millisecond after his time of death, his consciousness is teleported into that of a nearby housefly, soon to be munched on by a spider). It is even **Quite Possible** that **I-Was-You** in a past life, for example.

akatokuro,StarWars,1389161821.0,"During the old republic, the Jedi were not well known. They were monastic peacekeepers who settled disputes. People don't know the story of any of them. During the Clone Wars, it was reps vs seps. Jedi as a whole might get credit for successes, and as a whole certainly be blamed for failures. The masses didn't know or care about General Skywalker and his heroics, or the Great Negotiator Obi-Wan Kenobi. With the rise of the empire, they became enemies, information was suppressed, and underground they became myth and legend--as a group.

Following the rebellion and the fall of the empire, Lukes' story is told and becomes public record as a hero of the rebellion. The entire ordeal is once again pieced back together into public record. So his name and fate would be out there at that point.

Owen/Beru were likely told he died in the purge. There had met him and knew him to be impulsive and driven, so made up a new history for him to protect Luke."

xthorgoldx,AdviceAnimals,1389161830.0,"It's a classic case of ""[Seinfeld is Unfunny.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny)"" A creative work - a movie, a song, a character - becomes so ubiquitous and well-entrenched in a genre that, after a period of time, he's mistaken for being cliche. Seriously, read the example for Superman on that page - it describes OP's sentiment exactly.

No, Superman being invincible, superpowerful, and a paragon of truth, justice, and the American way isn't cliche. *He's the first one to do it.* The characters that would make that trope cliche were all based off of Superman - it's only cliche because Superman was so popular that everyone tried to recreate it.

You see the same thing with Batman. ""Oh, boo hoo, his parents died, what a cliche character origin."" **HE DID IT FIRST** (well, there's the whole *Krypton exploding* thing, but Superman didn't angst over it). It's only cliche because you're late to the party!"

So, if no one is requesting anything, keep promoting squads and giving people supply drops. BUT if squad leaders do request things, it's good to keep your asset bar full (Promote, Supply Drop, Rapid Deploy, Vehicle Drop... All available) to assist the squad leaders as fast as possible.

Like /u/Sandman253 said, use your EMPs to block cruise missiles. I always try to have either the Proxy Attack or EMP UAV available when the enemy commander has control of the cruise missile objective. If you get caught in a pickle and have neither, and the other commander knows it and launches a cruise missile... Put down an Evac Order on the impact site. Most people get the picture now to GTFO or get cruised.

Other than that, spam the infantry/vehicle scans, spam the UAV wherever squads are pushing an objective... And give squad leaders orders to take objectives, that way you can find out which squads are the best ones to help throughout the game. :)"

FreedomCow,TrueAskReddit,1389161882.0,"To compare:

In learning about cultures about the Pacific Northwest (specifically ranging from Alaska to central western Washington), we were taught that the tribes of the region were *matrilineal*, but not *matriarchal*. For example, with the Tlingit people of Alaska, everyone belonged to a certain moiety (similar to a clan) of either the Raven or the Eagle (and sometimes Wolf). The moiety you belonged to was the one you inherited from your mother, and you could only marry someone who belonged to the opposite moiety. However, men still definitely lead the tribe, and uncles were very very important figures to their sisters' children. Women had very different and in some ways bigger roles than the white people who would come later by comparison, but it was not a matriarchal society."

I'm still tripping over that line Sherlock drops about having a list of things his mother has to answer for. That in itself I could have brushed off, but then he goes out of his way to say that Mycroft has ""a file"" of things she needs to answer for. The comment and the tone it was given in seriously suggested that Sherlock has some beef with his mother. Maybe it's just your basic nagging-Mum Syndrome, who knows? But maybe not.

Also, didn't Gatiss say in the DVD commentary that Sherlock deduced as a child an affair in his parents marriage (I'm not sure if it was stated which parent was having the affair) that tore the family apart? I never actually heard the audio but remember people talking about it a while back."

Initially, it was said that a Twinkie diet was ridiculous and you can't lose weight on a Twinkie diet because the macros don't work out. I submitted a link to show that apparently at least one person can lose weight on just twinkies.

I then asked if there was any data to support the idea eating at McDonalds generally leads to a balanced diet with healthy macros. If you have data to show that eating fast food promotes health, please share it. 

I have no doubt that at least one person has eaten a healthy diet at McDonald's. I have no doubt that at least one drug user has share needles without contracting a bloodborne disease. I have no doubt that at least one person has had unprotected sex with strangers and not caught an STD. None of these examples means any of this is a good idea.

I don't give a shit about McDonalds or twinkies or any of the other nonsense here. I m just saying that if you want to make a health claim, back it up with data.

kuma_k,AdviceAnimals,1389162192.0,"Not sure what you're alluding to, but in Man of Steel, they would have killed Kal-el to get the ""Kryptonians"" back.  Remember that Jor-el infused him with the ""codex"" of his people, the thing that birthed Kryptonians with a specific purpose and apparently took away free will, to an extent.  I mean, they have free will, but they seem bound to their purpose quite heavily.  Remember Zod kinda loses it because his purpose was to protect his race? After Kal-el made his decision to save humanity because Krypton had ""had its chance"", he loses his shit, learns to fly, then rampages a bit, ultimately forcing Superman's hand with an ultimatum: either killing him, or letting the human family die before him.  (Superman doesn't seem to have a good scope on things, considering he is surrounded in the ruins of Metropolis, along with hundreds of thousands of dead humans anyway)

They could have terra-formed Mars, but they'd still be lacking the people.  And apparently normal reproduction is too icky for Zod.  Well, he calls it ""heresy"" in the movie. lol"

Variance is random. You can't assume variance is always making the division winner look worse. The effect of the variance could just as easily be inflating the record of the division winner with the weaker record, making the scenario even more unfair. What if the 8-8 division winner had a much weaker schedule than the 12-4 wildcard? What if ""variance"" caused an 8-8 division winner to win 8 games when their stats shows they ""should"" have won six? 

Variance doesn't always work in the direction you're hoping it does. So just use record and be done with it... we're not performing detailed statistical analysis to determine playoff seedings at any point, we're just using record. All I'm saying is, use it 1-6 across the board instead of just 1-4, and then artificially doing 5-6 separately."

Now, put some pie dough (get the premade stuff, or a pre-made tin) and put it in a tin, add the apples, then most (not all!) of the syrup, add a top, and brush it gently with the syrup. Bake, and you have pie. That is why you prepare apples."

xthorgoldx,AdviceAnimals,1389162597.0,"What do you mean? It's the codifier for a platformer game. It's as generic as you can get. 

Walk to the right. Don't fall into the bottomless bits, time your jumps and movement so you land on the platforms. Don't get hurt by the enemies. Don't go too slow or you'll run out of time. Collect shinies to get points. Get the highest score possible. Who's Mario? The guy you play. Who's Bowser? The reason you're walking right. What's the Mushroom Kingdom? The background to whatever level you're playing.

Every single Mario game can be summarized as ""Move right, don't fall, don't touch enemies."" There's no puzzling, there's no story, there's no continuity (hence why you can go from World 1 to World 8 without a problem)... it's literally the definition of a platformer, held aloft by its sheer simplicity, nostalgic inertia, and design polish. 

Now, platformers are a bit of a different beast because they're replayable due to their sheer simplicity - someone wants to play a game, a Mario platformer isn't hard to pick up and just chill with, so you don't see people getting bored of the concept. They can play, win, get their dopamine hit from the victory, go on with their daily lives.

At the time my self-esteem was pretty low and I (embarrassingly enough) was wearing an anime tshirt so I assumed he was making fun of me and blew him off. I didn't even realize he was genuine until my friends who were with me gaped at me afterwards :( I'm sorry, random college guy...!

TryUsingScience,changemyview,1389162628.0,"Maybe your life sucks. My life is awesome. I dance and fight and craft cool things and hang out with attractive and intelligent people. But most of the awesome stuff I'm doing right now, I was not doing in high school.

I enjoyed high school, but like you, I lived in a town in the middle of nowhere without much going on and was way too busy to have more than a couple of hobbies at once. And only one adult - one - ever told me that *life just keeps getting better.* People whose best years are high school are to be pitied; college is much better, and being an adult with a decent job is even better than college.

You'll have more free time in college because even if you take 18 credits you'll still be spending fewer hours in class than you do now. The homework is more challenging but not always more time-intensive. Not to mention that if you live on campus your commute time drops to zero. (Computer science is not ""a ton of work,"" by the way. That was my major and I also had two minors and a ton of extracurriculars. You have to remember that CS people tend to all be slackers.)

You don't need to find a life partner before your mid-20s. That sounds terrifying. I'm in my mid-20s and can't imagine settling down any time in the next ten years.

You can have happiness later. Just no longer being in high school will be a major improvement. You can even have happiness now, but it's a little harder than just waiting is. Everyone else's suggestions about hobbies and whatnot are good, but there's also something else you can do without impinging on your free time: practice gratitude. 

It sounds cheesy as hell but it makes a difference. Every night before you go to bed, list all the things that are going *right* for you. Even something as simple as all the things that aren't wrong with your body - don't have a headache, aren't nauseous, no broken bones, no runny nose, etc. Move on to having a nice safe place to sleep, a reliable source of food. Family. Whatever talents or bits of luck you may have. You'll probably fall asleep or get distracted before you run out of things, which is awesome - you have so much going for you that you can't even list it all! "

Spishal_K,lostgeneration,1389162684.0,"That's not quite what I was saying. I'm saying that non-STEM degrees that used to be awash in jobs (Business, certain arts degrees, etc) are now facing heavy competition either from, as you mentioned, the fact everyone has a degree, outsourcing, or simply being phased out altogether. We're entering a world where having a college degree, even a good one, at best barely gets your foot in the door, and at worst doesn't mean jack shit.

Our educational and societal system is built around the idea that college is the route to success, and now that *everyone* is getting a degree, this simply isn't the case, at least not implicitly. You can certainly succeed using the last generation's methods but it takes a lot more work than it did for them and no small amount of luck.

We're looking at what should be a power vacuum, where either highly-specialized or highly experienced labor is being rewarded far beyond what anyone with a degree would get, but we're not really seeing many people pull those jobs in due to the financial or time commitments necessary to reach that level of experience/education. Therefore the middle class is dwindling as the bar for entry is being raised while the steps necessary to take your post-graduation route to a better career are getting more and more difficult. I'm perfectly willing to admit that today's youth are bitchy about the fact that they're not getting good jobs out the college gate, and that it's not always the fault of the economy, but don't pretend like there isn't a crisis going on."

akatokuro,StarWars,1389162987.0,"In a manner, yes. A dark jedi is any being that uses the dark side. A Sith is a culture/religion that a dark jedi adheres to (though can make an argument that one could be a light side sith).

The rule of two came about as a necessity to overtake the Jedi. Dark Jedi crave power, and the Sith cult is no different. The hubris and lust for more makes infighting common, weakening the sith from the inside, allowing Jedi to maintain their dominance. The rule of two concentrates that power, making sure knowledge is retaining and hopefully improved upon with each generation until they have destroyed the Jedi(idea being the apprentice can't kill the master until they have matched or surpassed the master in skill).

Vader was on one to inherit the title and most instruction from Palpatine. The other force sensitive agents were only trained in certain aspects, the thought being they would never become strong enough to pose a threat. Though of course, Palpatine like many Sith before him, assumed he could never die, and indeed found means to resurrect himself for a time. Bane was an outlier in that he realized the only way for Sith advancement was to prepare for your motality and improve the next generation."

Arqueete,web_design,1389163024.0,"I have a related associates degree from a two-year technical college. I don't think the degree itself has much value, but I did get a lot of value from the experience of getting the degree. It forced me to complete projects to meet deadlines and requirements and then get feedback on my work, it introduced me to some technologies and ideas I hadn't previously been familiar with, and it gave me a better understanding of the industry (and helped me get an internship). I entered the program just out of high school and was still trying to figure out what exactly I was looking for in a career, etc.-- it was good for me to have a couple years to focus on learning and building a portfolio, and I was fortunate enough to be in a position to do that. School gave me the structure I needed to do it effectively. If you're already working professionally, I'm not sure school would give you those same benefits.

Would you learn things you would not otherwise learn in internet research? The unfortunate thing about these kinds of college courses is they vary in quality. You hear horror stories about colleges with courses teaching outdated or just plain incorrect information. Ideally, yes, you could get into a class with a teacher who has experience to share, a deep knowledge of the subject, or even would be a valuable connection, and you could get a lot out of the class even if you already knew a lot of the material. You could also waste your time in a class where, for example, you're being taught from a textbook on how to use a piece of software you already know. Be careful of that.

Basically: I think classes definitely have the potential to be valuable, but it's important to be realistic about just what you can get out of them and whether those are the things you need in your life and career right now-- just going to school does guarantee you will gain anything worthwhile."

I was short so I had to hem all my skirts to be the 2"", because too long was also considered unkempt. Sadly with my short torso, 2 inches ""looked"" really skimpy, so I was often getting measured in the corridor and met with a ""oh, huh ..., hmm, well, its 2 inches, on your way Ms Mundabit.""

and that was just the skirt. Thankfully squishing myself into 44B's kept my bust looking average in high school, but I still found myself buying shirts 8x larger and having to take them in, resulting in teachers saying ""mundabit, is that the school shirt? why has it got darts and no one elses does, go get one from the nurse"" and then subsequently ""mundabit, why are you wearing a circus tent?""

Just recently I was helping out at a childcare centre and the superviser called over two of us girls.

There is absolutely zero you can do about their subreddit. At all. Nothing. Zip. You can wail and rage and shake your fists at the heavens, but it's not going to do jack shit. 

Want to know the things you *can* do? Start your own subreddit. Tell people about it. Run things the way you want them to be run. "

I'm doing well and have been dating a non-abusive FANTASTIC man for almost two years now. I never knew how beautiful life could be. Shit, on top of it all, i;ve lost 132 lbs. 

My gripes are small. I wish my daughter's bio-dad visited her more. He and I are on ok terms, but he doesn't make much of an effort to see her, and now that she is four, it's beginning to hurt her. I had way too many friends who idolized their dads and hated their moms because they never met their dads, and resent their their moms for keeping them apart. As much as it hurts my baby, I want the decision to never see her dad again, to be her's. Still, it's hard watching her learn who her daddy really is. 

She also calls my bf daddy, so I;m really happy she has such a great guy to look up to. Still, when my ex cancels and may daughter ends up crying, it hurts my chest. I just want to protect her. She deserves to feel loved. I love her to death. "

There'll be rubber gaskets probably on both sides, and the top part on the roof (where the plastic strainer is) may be joined/sealed right into the roofing.  /u/backpackwayne has mentioned coating the roof and that's not a bad idea, but if you don't fix those gaskets you may not solve anything.

&gt; When playing an original Game Boy game on a later system, the user can choose which color palette is used. This is achieved by pressing certain button combinations, namely either A or B (or neither) and a direction key while the Game Boy logo is displayed on the screen.

&gt; These palettes each contain up to ten colors. **In most games, the four shades displayed on the original Game Boy would translate to different subsets of this 10-color palette, such as by displaying movable sprites in one subset and backgrounds, etc. in another.** The grayscale (Left + B) palette produces an appearance essentially identical to that experienced on the original Game Boy, the inverted colors palette (Right + B) inverts the colors from the Game Boy Color's color palettes.

Emphasis mine.  Maybe that somewhat answers your question."

(I'm not a UU; I'm pagan. But if I weren't, I'd be a UU. [Actually I could still be a UU even while being pagan, I just don't like getting up early on Sundays.])

Their religious education program for kids rotates between all the world's religions so that children know what all their options are. It also includes a comprehensive sex-ed program, among other useful things. It's perfectly okay to be an atheist and a UU, or believe in Jesus as your savior and be UU, or be a Buddhist and UU, or be an atheist Buddhist who views Jesus as an excellent role model. Or anything else you can think of. The UU's coming of age ceremony involves each person getting up and giving a statement of their personal beliefs, whatever those beliefs happen to be. Many interfaith couples end up at UU churches because it's a place they both can be welcome.

UUs tend to be fairly liberal and have nothing against homosexuality, abortion, equal rights for everyone, or any other political issue that it's possible to be on the wrong side of. Their biggest problem is having too many committees. 

With the negatives out of the way, let's focus on the positives. UU congregations engage in acts of charity that better their communities. Belonging to a welcoming religious community has been shown to help people's mental (and by extension, physical) health.

We had amazing chemistry together and I developed a bad crush on him. He went through a list of all these amazing attributes i had but i knew it was coming: the reason why none of this mattered. I was too chunky for him. I was pretty but my weight stopped him from pursuing anything. Now that I'm 26, I think WTF, ya know? 

We could have had a great relationship. Then again, we could have had terrible fights and hated each other. He wasnt the most gorgeous guy and I looked past that but he couldn't. And that made me realize: HE WASNT WORTH WASTING MY ENERGY ON. He was shallow and put beauty ahead of personality or chemistry which, as you get older, you realize thats a red flag. 

I know it hurts and it will for sometime. Someone you held to a higher standard THINKS you are ugly and won't date you because of it. And that is COMPLETELY UNFAIR TO YOU. He is not right for you if his standard of beauty is higher on the list than the person you are.

I've been in a relationship for 4 years now. I'm still friends with the guy from high school. We partied on New Years and while I love him dearly, he is a wreck. He still prefers beauty over personality and wonders why he loses interest so fast and can't find a girl right for him. He values intelligence but won't date a smart girl if she isn't flat chested and tiny. Its his preference and ive mentioned if he changed instead of trying to change the girls hes with, maybe he would find someone to be happy with.

Bottom line is, he missed out and does not deserve your energy or time. You are beautiful and someday you will find a guy thats head over heels hot for your looks and your personality. &lt;3"

Authiel,TumblrInAction,1389164591.0,"I saw your post on Tumblr and reblogged it. (I'm Woodelven.)

Seriously, though, thank you. Someone literally just tried pointing out to me on Tumblr that there are ""canonically black Elves called Moriquendi, but we don't see them in The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit.""

Sigh. I really hate running into this misconception.

Moriquendi are ""dark Elves,"" true -- but they aren't acually BLACK. Moriquendi means that they are literally ""in the dark,"" since those are the Elves who did not see the Two Trees of Valinor. They're actually in the majority of the Elves of the Third Age, and we almost exclusively see them in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, since they include all of the Sindarin and Silvan Elves. If we want to get really specific, Legolas and his father are both Moriquendi.

So, you're absolutely right that all Elves are white. And that makes sense. I've seen a few SJWs trying to deny that M-E is England, but it's England. ""Middle-earth"" is an archaic term for England, as found in Beowulf, the work Tolkien took a tremendous amount of inspiration from. Tolkien felt that England had no proper mythology and that it borrowed too much from the myths of other countries, so he set out to make his own mythology for England.

It's flippin' England."

I was depressed 2 years ago, not extremely bad depression but depression nonetheless. I had friends, I laughed, I cried and I, above all, lived. So why was I depressed you may ask? Well I thought it was because that I didn't have a gf and didn't think of myself as gf material. But this year people started saying things like, ""Dang, TyrantKronos sure has changed for the better this year. I should talk to him to soon."" 

So what the actual fuck made me think that I wasn't worth anybodies time? That was rhetorical OP don't worry, I'll answer it. **My** scumbag head didn't believe I was worth anyone's time. **My** own fucking brain! Now what do you make of that,  your life is so low that even your brain loses confidence. The solution is so simple that even I was flabbergasted when I made sense of it: You are you. Don't believe what anyone else says about you, hell don't believe what your brain says about you. Keep your head up high and look ahead to your target however simple or complex it might be. If you keep two eyes straight ahead then their is no room for worrying about your love life or anything else.

For example, many condominiums pay for the maintenance and repair of everything ""studs out"". There is also a master insurance policy that they are required to carry that will give you additional coverage.

You should see a small menu pop up. Disable running the game in 64-bit mode (32-bit is more stable for me, but do what works best for you), and switch Multithreading to the opposite of whatever it is currently set. By default, this feature should be ENABLED.

JonWood007,lostgeneration,1389164903.0,"Yeah...not really an option really...going back means MORE student loan debt, and in this economy you really DONT have a chance at a job without years of experience. So...easier said than done, which explains a lot of the hostility.

Especially since the pre recession understanding of things is a lot different than the post recession understanding. You need to understand, back in 2006 when I entered college, it was seen as a ticket to an upper class lifestyle, and you're often not adequately informed of the risks going in because so many middle class families just seen it as a ticket to success. Add in the fact of me being religious at the time which TOTALLY destroyed any chance of making a rational decision where I left things to ""God's plan"" (yeah, I was strongly religious until the end of grad school), and it's really no wonder I didn't make good decisions. The whole thing is, it's easy to go on in hindsight about how I could've done things differently, but it's completely unproductive to condemn people for it, which is what you seemed to be doing in this topic. Especially when the economy really IS especially bad statistically, with people working harder for less than our parents did, bad unemployment, new grads in EVERY field being greeted with ""entry level"" positions requiring 2-5 years of experience, etc. But seeing how you are in your 30s, you probably didn't experience a whole lot of that compared to people in their 20s and fresh out of school, did you? Trust me, we really do have it bad, and it's not just bad decisions and the whatnot, our entire society is screwed up at the moment with jobs disappearing and corporate profits at an all time high, and instead of sitting around going on about how its our fault, we should be working for social change to mitigate the problems we face. Trust me, I majored in political science and also have a background in sociology, remember? I've studied these things. "

One Piece because I've never had a show make me become so invested in it emotionally and feel for every character, good and bad, like this one has. Never thought I'd cry over a ship, but it's happened. I even recently rewatched the Arlong park arc and had me crying over Nami's story. It's so good at tugging at just the right way.

Baka and Test because it's an anime that just gets my humor. It fits me perfectly. I've watched it at least three or four time all the way through and I still crack up laughing at it every time. I love it.

Finally, Baccano! The story, the humor, the action, the plot and storyline, the intricacy of weaving all of the characters together like it does. Seriously an awesome anime with a fantastic english voice cast.

Don't try to stop caring, use that negative energy as work out energy and energy to fuel new experiences. If you don't have a job start there, 24 hours a week about and you've started. You're too heavy to work? Get some assistance and get on weight loss.

Just start and don't procrastinate it any longer. It doesn't get any harder than starting the routines you need to be happy. Your body will fight your happiness every step of the way (which is happening now by the sounds of it). You want to do something to change but your mentality of 'why bother' is the resistance you must give it the middle finger and make a small change.

Then after you make some small habits it's really much more smooth from there on out.

Honestly give it a try, I'm rooting for you. :)

Notice how I didn't mention weight? Learn to cook good food and exercise, you get fit enough to do stuff and have a damn good reason to be heavy still. Obligatory 'Chicks love good cooks.'!

Edit - Yes many women will still not want to date you, but guess what, 10's and 9's on the 'scale' date 10's and 9's... if you're having trouble getting anyone you're a ways from there, keep realistic standards. Girls who you may rate lower will surprise you. My best relationships have been with girls that many find average. :)

Edit 2 -  Keep your abnormal habits inside for the first while if you do find a girl and are interested. Love kids shows, Dora, My little pony, ect. just keep that to yourself for now, and talk about your favorite game that is relatable like your favorite mario or shooter like halo or battlefield. Like drawing? Like painting? Like reading?

Passions are passions, that's what's important. You may find yourself surprised at how passionate you can be about things. I genuinely believe you've got potential and should try and fulfill it! Otherwise I wouldn't bother with this, would I? :)"

ADillPickle,AskMen,1389165529.0,"I know this is late, but i would like to get it off my chest. Around April of 2013, i became infatuated with a woman and we hung out, had a lot of the same interests. She was smart and pretty cute but maybe because I was lonely, or maybe because I felt bad for her or maybe because I did actually like her, I ended up spending some time with her and got to know her. She had actually just broken up with her borfreind before I did anything with her, but I was talking to her at that time. It was going well, I had met her family and gotten along well with them. One day, I went to meet her downtown and as soon as I saw her, I thought to myself, ""Why am I here?""

 And that's when i realized that it just fell off. She didn't do anything; I think I was the at fault party for still being around her for a month after I thought that and I feel like i led her on, but I broke it off with her. 

The only explanation was that the honeymoon phase was over and that I realized that she was not what I wanted and that she was too clingy for me and the glass shattered for me. "

Insertion was shitty but quick (also, less painful than either childbirth or an abortion - not to mention quicker! It took about 30 seconds for the painful bit).

Recovery was not as shitty as expected. It was on par with a bad (for me) period, which has always been on everyone else's light-to-middling side.

I could have sex after a week or two without my cervix feeling like it was being stabbed.

I felt weird 'twinges' every once in a while for the first year. My periods were worse (again, still easier than others').

I live with him in a tiny apartment (one bedroom, no door) so it's going to be interesting enough trying to sneak around and make this while he's around.

Boyfriend has a kitchenaid mixer he recently got from his aunt. I suppose I could try to make icing in that. I have no idea how to use it though, and I think he'll notice me turning it on. Maybe I can get a friend to take him out for lunch and give it a go. His favorite cake is carrot, is that hard to make from scratch? I was originally planning on just doing the boxed mix since I'm not a great baker and we have very little kitchen space. It's there a way I can doctor up the box mix? Another idea I had was to ask him if he wants to help make his cake (he likes baking, I don't) and then I will secretly decorate it later. But would that ruin the surprise?

During our afternoon break, they interviewed a friend of mine and they asked us who wanted to sit in the background. I said that I did. They did their interviews and went, I guess they got all the footage they needed.

That evening, the story was broadcast. My mum was so proud that she had a video tape on standby to record that particular segment. We were all sat watching it when suddenly, there I am in the background while my friend is being interviewed.

From a human perspective, something which will live in heaven watching over earth for at least the next ten million years is fairly much a god.

Not to mention that in mahayana, the Dharmakāya is very similar to Brahman in concept. And while it is certainly not monotheistic, it would be odd to not bring it up. And all of that is even not taking into account the strains which believe in adibuddhas which are more or less literal gods in as absolute a way as possible.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389165890.0,"Once again, it depends on the type of criminal. 

Serial killers probably aren't social and vocal about their habits, they hide them if anything. Many don't feel remorse, but actually get pleasure for killing. I guess the closest thing I've heard to a commune of sociopaths would be the manson family...and they were pretty cultish and believed some weird things, you might wanna read up on them.

This is different than your typical street criminal, which is a bit more complicated. In terms of gang violence, I guess it's the same as, say, killing in the military, or something like that. The us vs them mentality. You're the good guy, they're the bad, etc.

A lot of street criminals are also rather disengaged from society. Society is seen to fail them, so they don't even try. This is why a lot of people drop out of school, they see it as a waste of time. Same with legitimate opportunities for success like jobs. Instead they end up doing stuff that's illegal, like stealing or dealing drugs. It's seen as a better option for them than legitimate opportunities. Quite frankly, better addressing poverty and opportunities for these people from a young age might help a bit. 

These are just a few examples, there are many more. As I said, it's pretty complicated for a reddit post. Honestly, you're better off just researching stuff, or taking an elective course in criminology if you're interested."

IndependentBoof,changemyview,1389166193.0,"&gt; There are no downsides

That's not necessarily true. There are possible side effects, including (via [CRC](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm#side-effects)):

&gt; **The flu shot**: The viruses in the flu shot are killed (inactivated), so you cannot get the flu from a flu shot. Some minor side effects that could occur are:
&gt;
&gt; * Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given
&gt; * Fever (low grade)
&gt; * Aches
&gt;
&gt; **The nasal spray**: The viruses in the nasal spray vaccine are weakened and do not cause severe symptoms often associated with influenza illness. In children, side effects from the nasal spray can include:
&gt;
&gt; * Runny nose
&gt; * Wheezing
&gt; * Headache
&gt; * Vomiting
&gt; * Muscle aches
&gt; * Fever
&gt;
&gt; In adults, side effects from the nasal spray vaccine can include
&gt;
&gt; * Runny nose
&gt; * Headache
&gt; * Sore throat
&gt; * Cough

In short, getting the vaccine is a cost/benefit judgment. The risk of not getting it is catching the flu, which is pretty miserable and especially dangerous to those with weakened immune systems. The risk of getting it is a chance of getting minor flu-like symptoms."

lalicat,offbeat,1389166341.0,"Navy guy here, been in almost 11 years. Relatively high up the food chain and I've dealt with a few public affairs cases. We take our oath very seriously. I have my people say the Sailors creed all the time and it starts: 'I am a United States Sailor. I will support and defend the constitution of the United States of America and obey the orders of those appointed over me.'

I doubt you'll find a more patriotic or libertarian leaning segment of the population than in the current active duty and veteran population. The reason we are so libertarian is because we've signed away our rights and have basically no freedom. We don't have the 1st or 4th amendment protections (and 5th to a lesser extent) your average citizen has. 

Public affairs is ridiculously tricky. The military is one of the most image/reputation conscious organizations I've ever seen in my life. It's very important to us that we maintain the image of the stalwart hero defending freedom and democracy while faithfully executing the will of the people as consummate professionals. That being said, any official statement or public release is put under a fuck ton of scrutiny. We are regularly instructed not to comment on even the most mundane things and 'refer anybody asking questions to public affairs' in the war zone we are told 'do not discuss the politics or operations, you will only talk about your family and patriotism' and they have every right to tell us what we can and can't say because we signed the bottom line. 

We've basically become an organization who's shit terrified to speak for fear we might misrepresent the organization. There are also very harsh reprisals for anyone breaking this routine, we are like hungry dogs and will eat our own alive if they make us look bad in any way. It happens all the time, we see some jack ass out in town in uniform with his hands in his pockets and he doesn't look like a recruiting poster you bet your ass someone is going to jack him up about it. This is why I never wear my uniform in public, I hate having to stand up shoulders back and smile at everyone, hold doors for everyone and walk with a purpose. It's exhausting, I'd much rather just be joe sixpack and waltz around with my usual goofy walk and bad posture but once that uniform goes on its a complete different mentality.

These public affairs guys live that all the time and I honestly feel sorry for them. They are not trying to stone wall anyone they are simply manifesting the terror we all feel that we will do or say something stupid especially when we know there will be hell to pay, like I said we eat our own alive and without mercy. I have no doubt this guy has been reprimanded and either fired or basically had his career advancement terminally halted. All because he accidentally attached the wrong file to an email ...."

Russia has constant stomach problems. Russia doesn't care. He realizes that if he dies no one will miss him. His dad died from a Krokodil overdose. Russia didn't cry at his dad's funeral. The walk to work is always hard. Russia used to own a car. America strapped C4 to it. Russia sometimes wishes that he didn't get out at the last minute. Russia passes by the poor on the streets of Vladivostok.  Russia has some spare change. He decided against giving his change. Russia arrives at work at 6:30 am. No one thanks him. His paperwork is hard. But he knows that it doesn't matter. If he died today there would be another sad sap who takes his place. At 7:00 am the other workers arrive. Russia has coffee made for everyone there. No one thanked him. Russia considers putting pain pills into the coffee pot. His mind races with the problems that would be solved. He sits back down after not being able to make up his mind. At 10:00 am the managers walk in. No one enjoys the managers. Everyone knows that they are only there because they kicked the ass of some punks that were on the CEO's lawn. Russia doesn't judge though. He just sighs to himself and wonders if the death penalty is in the new federation. At lunch the groups form up and go off to lunch. Russia is not invited. Russia just eats his sandwich. Russia sees a bug in it. Russia eats it anyways. Russia gets up to throw away his food and passes his coworkers paperwork. None of it is done. Russia sighs and takes the work to his desk. Russia finishes his section's work. Russia puts it back in its right place. No one thanks Russia. Some chew him out for doing parts of it wrong. Most don't care. Russia cleans up his desk and starts to go home. One of the 5 bosses stops him and hands Russia more work. Says its promotion material. Russia isn't buying it. Russia says nothing. Just stuffs it into his bag and nods. The walk home is cold. Russia sees no more homeless. Russia remembers college and what he wanted to do in his life. Russia remembers what his boss said once. Work makes you free. Russia keeps forgetting that for some reason. The security guard at Russia's apartment doesn't even flinch when Russia falls. Russia feels bad for messing up the cities sidewalk. Promises to pay extra taxes for it. Never does. Russia walks up the apartment's stairs. They are broken and Russia feels like he should tell the manager. He never does. Russia unlocks his door and silently thanks god that there was no eviction notice. Russia lies on the couch and sees a message on the machine. Probably mom. Russia deletes it before hearing the message. Russia feels hungry. Hates what he eats. Wants to eat healthy. Orders kebabs. Eats alone. Russia walks into the bath/bedroom. Brushes teeth and lies on the bed. Looks at the ceiling. Sees a spot. Contemplates life. Contemplates killing the person living upstairs. Realizes that he doesn't have the balls. Russia watches TV until early in the morning. Falls asleep. Dreams a dream of sadness and lost potential. Wakes up. Forgets dream. Starts a new day."

I don't know who upvoted this comment but let me simulate it so I can get upvoted too.

After the 1970s computers were mostly used in offices, with a few computers starting to show up in rich kid's houses (ala Wargames).

By the time SNES came out you started to see a big increase in computer sales (mostly driven by games like Commander Keen, a Mario ripoff made by some nerds who would later make millions).

Bill Clinton's secretary of state Al Gore really gave rise to the PC gaming we know today when he invented The MSN Gaming Zone for Microsoft....

... At least I think. I didn't do any research or pay attention to computer history. I just know how to put sentences together that includes phrases like ""PCs are for work""... I've heard of Doom and Quake, but I didn't hear that the team consisted of more than 2 guys. "

When people in the West talk about ""moderates"" Muslims making up the majority, they think they're talking about Muslims who support secularism over Shariah law, are okay with LGBT rights and tolerate free expression. This is simply not true. Most ""moderate"" Muslims want Shariah law (as elections in the Muslim world constantly show), they want homosexuals executed and are more than happy to violently silence any criticism of Islam. The only difference between them and extremists is that they don't want to go on a jihad against the West or Muslims of other sects. However you'll be deluding yourself if you think that most Muslims could be well integrated into modern society. They still have a long way to go."

* Rent. If you have your own place or your flatmates are cool, utilise services such as [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com.au/) to rent out your space when you're not there. Nights that you spend at a partners house or on vacation could be bringing in some extra income.
* Petrol. In the same vein, cars are expensive. Share it when you're not using it, and use the money to cover petrol and repairs. [Car Next Door](http://www.carnextdoor.com.au/) is a service for this.
* Groceries. Share food. Lots of people do leftover swaps with neighbours. Saves you from the monotony of eating the same food over and over, but still allows you to cook in bulk and save that way.
* Rent things instead of buy. While this isn't great for stuff you'll use long-term, it saves once-off purchases. I'm a sucker for kitchen appliances, but I've started renting slushie machines etc. rather than buying when the mood strikes. [Open Shed](http://www.openshed.com.au/) is a service for this.
* Parking. Especially if you work in the city, parking in a bitch. Gumtree has a section where people rent out spare private parking spots. If you don't drive, consider renting out your own parking spot.
* Credit cards. If you have the discipline, credit cards can be a great way to get some extra value. I have a Commbank Awards card. I use it for everything, and then pay it off immediately. I pay no interest, and earn enough rewards points to cover the annual fee, and then earn about the equivalent of a domestic flight per year.

&gt; I believe that because the flu is changing every year, it makes no certainty that I won't get one next year (not that I often get the flu anyway).

Flu vaccines are seasonal vaccines. That is, they make it for particular strains of the flu that they expect to be most prevalent. Consequently, they recommend getting a new one every year.

&gt; Maybe I'm misinformed, but I don't really see a reason to get the flu vaccine, even whilst (obviously) supporting the vaccines for the famous diseases (smallpox and what have you).

Even if you're not worried about catching it yourself, if you have any exposure to people with weakened immune systems (sick, babies, elderly, etc) you risk passing the flu to them. The flu is much more dangerous for those with compromised immune systems than it is for the rest of us.

finalDraft_v012,asianamerican,1389166735.0,"Intro: 2nd generation Chinese in the US; my parents were 2nd gen Chinese in the Philippines (this matters a bit).  Sorry to make this so long, I see you got a lot of good, long responses from others with more interesting stories to share!

**Did your parent's ever try to teach you the language ?**

Sorta.  My mom's side of the family speaks mostly Tagalog, and some of the women know the Min Nan dialect (they're from the Fukien province).  They'd talk to each other in Tagalog, but speak English to me and my older sister.  Supposedly, my mom asked my dad (who is fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, Min Nan, and Tagalog) to speak to us in Mandarin.  They both thought that was the best dialect to learn, but he ended up never doing that.  So me and my sister were only spoken to in English as we grew up.  They had accents themselves, so some of my English can be a little foreign sounding.  My boyfriend keeps saying ""Multipass"" to me like Lilu from *The Fifth Element*, because of my occasional accents.  My sister has mostly white friends and she has zero pronunciation issues in English.

The only time my mom would break from that and unleash Tagalog was when she was angry at us, so we're quite familiar with the more insulting kind of words.  My dad also refers to my maternal uncle as Buk-buk (not sure of spelling, I'm terrible with written Tagalog), which is really, REALLY mean and horrible!  Because he was referring to my uncle as that, I remember coming home and asking my mom about it.  I don't remember if I ever said it to my uncle, but I really hope I didn't.  My parents were divorced since I was born, and my maternal uncle has been like a father to me.

They did send me to Chinese school on Saturdays, but this was a failure when I was a kid.  All the other classmates were fluent in Cantonese and were there mostly to learn how to write...so my writing is pretty good in Mandarin....couldn't speak very well or understand.  I did terrible, I'd get 2/100 on my tests!!!  This changed years later, once I grew up a little.

**Were you put into ESL (English as Second Language), even though you spoke English ?**

Nope!  But my older sister join ESL in college at one point, thinking it would be an easy A.  She soon realized it was too infuriating to listen to people who were bad at English (she went to a great private high school) and eventually switched to normal Literature class.

EDIT: Just remembered...I was borderline failing English in high school.  Got 70-75's, meanwhile all my other grades were 90+.  They offered to assign me an English tutor, but I refused out of...I dunno. Pride?

**Did you learn the language by a learning program (Rosetta Stone) / enrolling in classes ?  Do you understand and can't speak ?**

So currently, I'm conversational and mostly literate in Japanese from taking lessons on weekends during high school.  Did this on my own with my own money from work; my dad hates Japanese.  Also did study abroad in the summer and that helped immensely, since it threw me in to the boondocks.  Rudimentary Chinese I remembered from childhood helped a lot here too.  In college, I took Mandarin on weekends at the local community center, which was all I could afford.  Some teachers were great and helped me a lot.  Did another study summer in Taiwan, which also helped immensely (I'd like to thank KTV), and at my current rate I would say can understand 65% of what people are saying....more if they speak slowly for me.  As you did, OP, I watched a lot of movies and even took notes during them.

Cantonese is terrible, but sometimes I can pick out basic stuff.  Tagalog is awful.  I can understand half of what people are saying but my sentence making skills are non-existant, and I have trouble reading.  It is so frustrating sometimes when people ask you a question in another language, and you understand but don't know how to respond in the same language.  That is often the case for me.

**Have you come across family, wishing you speak fluently ?**

My dad wishes I could speak fluently, and one or two (out of dozens) of uncles and aunts have mentioned I should learn Tagalog/Chinese.  I wish I could too, so I could communicate with them better.  Some of them, especially my dad, have really awful English.  There are times when we visit him, I have to re-translate his Chinglish for my older sister.

**Are you actually fluent but only speak at home ?**

No, I wish!

**Has being able to speak your ancestral language been an asset in your life ?**

Somewhat. I can shop and order some food in Mandarin, so I'll use that and get discounts at retail stores.  I'll bargain, and I'm apparently good enough at mimicking the proper accent AND being minimalist enough with my words that store owners don't guess I'm from the US (if I'm abroad).  So that's come in handy!  I've helped a bunch of elderly Chinese who were lost on the streets of NYC - a few have had papers given to them that say an address, plus ""Please help, I don't speak English"" ... wtf?!  I feel like their son/daughter who wrote that should take better care of them.  The ones with the notes are usually very desperate looking, one that I helped almost cried and another tried to give me reward money for helping.  Anyway, so I've helped some lost old people!  It helps with designing graphics to pull some Chinese language knowledge as well.  Translated some things my boyfriend needed for work, and it felt good to see him proud of me.  I've conversed with Chinese workers at nail salons and have again gotten discounts or freebies thrown in; it's not enough to look Chinese, they won't be extra nice unless they realize you do somewhat know your home tongue.  My crappy Mandarin gets me by. Super wish I could do this with Tagalog, because my mom finds instant friends when we travel and they always help us out (especially if we're lost or don't know where the good local places to eat are).  Many countries have Filipinos working in it, so Tagalog is surprisingly useful.  Oh, occasionally my limited Mandarin affords me extra enjoyment in movies.  Like the final ep of *Louie* in Season 3 - he goes to Beijing and the whole final scenes are purely Mandarin.  You can tell the gist of what is going on without knowing Chinese, but understanding the conversation made it extra cute.

**What are you feelings on your parallel ethnic group not being able to speak/understand your native tongue ?**

I think we should all learn our native tongues, it's important and you will feel less left out of things.  And even if I were a white, 6th gen American, I would still think learning a foreign language is very important.  Cuz we are only a small part of the world, and languages open doors for you in unexpected ways.

**For those who don't speak their native tongue, did you ever ask your parents why didn't you teach me or talk to me in me in the language ?**

Oh, ALL THE TIME!!!  Especially because I feel like my mom and dad sometimes blame me for not already knowing Mandarin and Tagalog, but Mandarin was neeeveeer spoken at home and they'd always switch to English for us.  I wish she even spoke to us using her Min Nan dialect; growing up she said it's a dead language that no one speaks.  Turns out my Taiwanese friends understand it, and there is still a lot of Chinese who speak it in the world...plus it's still something to have a language other than English to speak to your maternal family in.

**Did racism or assimilation in your hometown play more of a factor not speaking your native tongue, or perfecting your English ?**

Honestly, I suspect my mom didn't speak to us in Tagalog or Chinese because she worried it would affect our assimilation.  Because she definitely knew since we were toddlers that my dad was only speaking to us in English as well.  Asian females have it hard, still, even in NYC.  I remember in high school, we had a young Filipina math teacher....and people would constantly make fun of her IN CLASS and to her face for her accent.  People didn't bother our Filipino math teacher for his strong accent, nor our Filipino Physics teacher.  I couldn't make sense of it but it infuriated me.

My mom said she did try to find a school that did dual languages for their classes - English &amp; Mandarin...because that is what her school was like back in the Philippines.  Unfortunately, Chinese wasn't popular here at that time and such things didn't exist in our area.  I hear they do exist now, especially in kindergartens.

EDIT: I wish I had more friends to practice both Mandarin or Tagalog with.  I'm too embarrassed to do that with family!"

Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1389166964.0,"Hey there, FYI, your account appears to have been ghosted. It's a mysterious reddit thingy which happens often to spammers as well as those who use proxies and/or post to controversial subs a lot. This is why your posts are not getting voted up, nobody can see them. The only people who can see them are either you or the mods of the sub you are posting to. You can appeal to reddit admins to have your account reinstated but it rarely works. I used to post as /u/nonsequitur1979 [+10] but got ghosted after I started posting in controversial subs (usually because of collectives of trolls who report you for stupid reasons and reddit's algorithms are rather unforgiving if you end up being the target of unwarranted mass-reporting). Try signing out and viewing your comment history and you'll see what I mean. Sign up with a new account and there's a good chance you'll be OK.

I originally noticed all this when I saw your post caught in the spam-trap. I approved it and others can probably see it now but be aware that all future postings to pretty much all subs are likely to be invisible to all but you and the mods, assuming they check the spam-trap regularly."

kites47,summonerschool,1389167319.0,"1. I am a nineteen year old student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Mechanical Engineering and Theatre Arts with a minor in Mathematics. I'm in a fraternity (Lambda Chi Alpha), am in a Glee Club, and do many shows on campus. I'm also gay (not super interesting, but for some reason I rarely find other gay men who play League).

2. I stop by here a few times every day. I pretty much read every post, though I'll be honest in saying I comment/post myself much less than I lurk.

3. I've been around here for a few months and have only been playing League of Legends since this summer, but I've gotten really into it and am never leaving. (My little brother is a Plat 1 player and got me to start).

4. I'm a student, so I have very odd hours, but I am generally pretty free. I am in the eastern standard time zone and play on the NA server.

5. I love this subreddit! Overall, I think it accomplishes what it strives to.

6. I definitely think there are some quality of life updates that could be made to this subreddit. I think archiving some of the major posts could be very useful, beyond just the FAQs. Further, I think that we should maybe have a tool created for finding people duo buddies. Maybe some form of a google doc (I could probably draft up something pretty easily). I think this'd be better than trying to do a weekly thread, because who wants to wait around all week to find a duo buddy? Haha. Something else I would add is an IRC chat or something similar so that people can talk in person to other people trying to improve their League games, as well as foster a better sense of community within the subreddit. People will start to get to know each other and recognize usernames much easier. Further, it may help with the earlier problem of finding a duo queue buddy.

7. I think that we should reach out to some of the pros (or just general high LP Diamond 1/Challenger players) that frequent the League of Legends subreddit and set up AMAs for people trying to improve their game to pick their brains. This could be a cool event for the subreddit. Beyond this, setting up a few competitions a year could be great for improving the community!

8. I've been in charge of many groups before and held leadership roles in many organizations. Further, as someone newer to the game, I know what I struggled with in coming to get to know the game, so having a fresher player may help with aiding those who are very new to the game. I also just love this game a ton and would love to see a community come out of this subreddit, and I think I could help with that.

9. Pretty much all of the ones I posted above, though obviously it would be after discussion with the other moderators to see their opinions. I have more ideas as well, but I'd have to talk with the current moderators and see where their vision is for subreddit, so I can make sure the changes I'd have in mind would be in line with that. Essentially, creating a community in this subreddit would be my main focus.

10. Other than being a newer player and having fresh eyes on the game, I also have many many IRL friends who play and would definitely get involved if I asked them in helping out this subreddit. I further have access to a ton of incredibly talented computer science majors at my school who would definitely help me out if I asked them to. My school is also very large and has many students who play League of Legends. It's part of the Ivy League, which actually has a strong LoL community, and I could help to bring more collegiate players into a community like this.

11. I would hide the post with a message to the user with the reason it was hidden. If the reason was fixed, then I would reinstate the post. If it was a minor infraction, such as someone had a rage comic at the end of a well-thought-out post that had encouraged a lot of discussion, I would message them asking to remove it, but probably would not take down the post.

12. The attack would most likely be due to a post being hidden. People would think it had to do with the content itself, and not how the content broke the rules. I would consult with the other moderators and draft a very amicable post that detailed how the post broke the rules, but also inquire to the public of the subreddit if they feel that rule is no longer relevant. If so, we could had a community discussion on the rule itself.

Thanks!"

He's even a dodger fan. Maddux helped the development of Billingsley when he was good, and was there for when Kershaw was getting it together... And Petriello just became a writer for fangraphs.

Necron_Overlord,TrollXChromosomes,1389167325.0,"A person who makes this argument is not defending men raping women.  It is not a justification, it is an explanation.  What is left out for brevity, and simply assumed to be understood, is that while some dogs may be trained, others are not.

I personally have no problem with using the analogy of men being dogs. Some dogs are big and tough, others are little and yappy, some dogs think they're still puppies, and some dogs are the product of years of abuse, neglect, and maltreatment.  Full of rage and anger and not in control of themselves.

Hence the ""putting a steak in front of a dog"" analogy.  This response is clever, but the key here is that it's *her* dog that she has trained.  Let's see what happens when she goes out and finds a dog in the streets that doesn't see her as his master and throws that can of peanut butter down."

IndependentBoof,changemyview,1389167498.0,"Many religious adherents share general views with their church but have some disagreements on particular dogma. Instead of looking at Catholic-specific doctrine then, let's specifically consider the accounts of *Jesus'* teaching. 

Matthew 5:27-28 (KJV):
&gt; Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.

In this passage, Jesus condemns not only pre-marital sex (adultery), but even lustful thoughts. What is your response to this? If there are no moral repercussions, then why would he have taught that lustful thoughts are sinful?

One might also look at Jesus' reaction to a group wanting to punish a woman who had committed adultery, as told in John 8:
&gt;  And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,
&gt; They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
&gt; Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?
&gt; This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.
&gt; So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.

Here, he empathizes with the adulterer and leaves her without punishment. However, he also adds:

&gt; When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?
&gt; She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.

In this case, Jesus offers forgiveness, but also directs her to ""sin no more."" It seems from this passage that Jesus is unambiguous about adultery being a sin and consequently suggests you should avoid it, even though he is forgiving of the woman who disobeyed. With that in mind, how do you reconcile your belief that it is not sinful with belief in Jesus who said it was?"

Skyler827,Bitcoin,1389167860.0,"The current law is unenforcable.  It requires people manually account for all of their bitcoin transactions and calculate their tax on their own.  No one is doing that.  Even if they wanted to, no one is even sure how to do that.  No one knows what obligations they may have, no one knows weather to classify it as a capital asset or foreign currency (and consequently what rate to pay), and no one knows how much information the IRS really has, or if they will use it to assert tax obligations.

If legislation like this passed, at least people would know.  Business would know.  Banks would know.  We might not be able to kill the volatility, but the legal uncertainty would go away.  More banks would offer deeper bitcoin integration, and it would become much easier to buy and sell.

As it stands now, only people who are extremely well capitalized and prepared to weather all risks, financial and legal, can afford to trade in bitcoin.  If it stays that way it is now, the bitcoin economy will never grow beyond a certain point (quite possibly very close to its current trade volume), and most of the specualtive value in bitcoin will dissappear."

Oh my gosh yay! I love bragging about my pets! I currently have a Catahoula Leopard Dog who just turned one a week ago. His name is Max! We adopted him from the humane society when he was almost three months old.  The thing we loved the most about him was his coat and how it has the stripes on it. He's a real troublemaker sometimes (he's been known to get out of his little house and basically destroy everything in sight) but we still love him. He's basically the baby of the house. My cat's name is Michi. We're not really sure what kind of cat she is or how she is. My dad ended up bringing her home one day because one of the ladies in the apartment complex where he works at was moving and couldn't keep her. Michi is awesome though. She loves to cuddle. She also really likes to be petted but only when it's on her terms. She basically walks up to you and waits for you to put her hand out and then she'll pet herself with your hand. It's really adorable. We also have two hamsters! Their names are Tick and Tack. They're both girls and REALLY REALLY loud. They squeak soooo much. They love playing but only for a little bit because then they get cranky. The other dog (the black one) in the album is Dexter. He's the same breed as Max but 5 months younger. He's my aunt's dog so we like to call them cousins. He is a real ball of energy. Whenever he gets really excited he doesn't just wag his tail, he wags his whole butt! It's really adorable. Him and Max will spend all day Playing and never get tired! I love all of them so so much.

finalDraft_v012,asianamerican,1389168325.0,"I went to the School of Visual Arts in NYC, and the school was ~40% Asians.  The majority was white, and a minuscule number of blacks and Latinos.  For the Asian demographic, the huge majority were Koreans straight from Korea; apparently they recruit heavily there.  Then there's a small number of Chinese, and really tiny amounts of Japanese, South East Asians, and I don't think I saw a single Indian there during my time.  Some Israelis were there too.

My friends group was pretty diverse, although foreigners (mostly the Koreans) who couldn't speak English really stuck together out of necessity.  It's strange, how do you attend classes when you can't understand the teacher?  Their solution was to get notes in Korean from the ones who *were* fluent in both Korean and English, after class ended.

There was a lot of Asian Americans as well, and everyone was friendly....white, black, Latino, everyone.  It was never weird and I never sensed hostility.  There was definitely some groupings where minorities tended to stick together, however within those groups we were not 100% Asian or anything.

The atmosphere is VERY intense, depending on your department.  I was in Computer Art, and they are very strict about attendance, grades, and you have to really love what you do...or else you will fail, or simply not get a job and end up switching careers anyway.  I think Film and Graphic Design are like that too.  Don't really know what the other majors were like, but when you see Illustration majors cutting out construction paper for their thesis for a few nights...meanwhile you work an entire year and often without showering or sleeping on YOUR thesis....it's hard not to think their major is way easier.  Plus you mix with the more Fine Artsy people during humanities classes (which are a joke) and they're the type that make you wonder if they even passed high school.

TIGit,Automate,1389168392.0,"I see here in /r/automate a lot of students and people removed from ""real"" automation in use right now. I work with automation now, in real factories, in ways that affect real lives of workers. Not a student, not in theory, not conjecture, not some glorified future, not an ideal. The cold fact that is right now automation does replace workers and redistributes wealth to the wealthy. 

The replaced workers often end up unemployed or with worse jobs and conditions than they had before. There may be a breaching point in time when automation makes surplus and we replace a working society with a post scarcity utopia (if ever such a thing can exist), however that is many years from now. 

In the mean time real people will lose their jobs, their houses, their healthcare, their pensions. They will struggle to make ends meet, to feed their children. There will be real pain during such a technological transition and expansion of automation. The short term of transition will last years, decades perhaps. The Industrial Revolution took 60+ years to grow a new society, and it did not include redistribution of wealth and breaking strongly entrenched cultural paradigms which both would be necessary for a post scarcity society to bring proper resources to all people and guarantee basic living conditions. Those who own the means of production will feat on the profits from automation and they will be loathe to render those goods and gains to distribute amongst the dispersed jobless ""freed from labor"" masses.

Again, such a revolution of automation will last long enough to ruin lives. People always shout back, ""But automation creates jobs!"" It does create some, that's true. The coders will code, the engineers will devise new procedures and parameters, the maintenance workers will oil and repair equipment, techs will collect data and oversee the autonomous process. But those jobs will be few- the point of automation is to reduce the necessity of paying people. Automation is only used when it cuts costs and reduces the labor needed to maximize profit. An automation system that is more expensive to build and maintain than workers is never used to ""free workers from labor and give them more time for better activities"". Don't delude yourself. Automation is only used for expanding profit and eliminating labor costs. That's why in China and Bangledesh there are still workers assembling things instead of robots- the workers earn slave wages and implementing automation would be more expensive than paying the worker $0.20 an hour. If automation was really about freeing human potential it would be relieving those workers of their labors as well instead of just ousting the jobs that pay living wages in first world settings.

So less workers will be employed, and those that will be employed around automation will be specialty jobs requiring higher degrees of training and experience. They will be beyond the reach of the people who are generally replaced by such systems. There is the cost of retraining/college, and the time lost. People who have families to feed and mortgages to pay cannot simply spend the time unpaid taking college classes, they will have to find new work instead of adapting their skills to the changing jobs landscape. That time/money for training is a luxury many do not have.

Don't look down on them, I see a lot of demeaning the humanity of low-skill individuals and they often get treated like baggage hampering a system of progress instead of considering them as human beings deserving of respect and empathy. (Engineers, I've found are exceedingly good of such sociopathic thoughts regarding workers as imperfections in their systems). All people should be able to earn a living to provide for themselves and their families. 

Those who talk about adapting these workers have obviously not worked with them. They're usually older folks, less educated, but earnest, honest, and hard  working. They don't learn new things fast, they don't adapt well to change, computers are scary to them and becoming jobless at age fifty years old is a dire sentence to poverty and unemployment do to ageism in hiring practices. The young technologically minded push for automation because they *can* adapt and so they blindly assume everyone is just like them and will also have little difficulty in adapting. Do not assume though that the general population of such workers is just as nimble-witted, technologically capable, and adaptable as yourselves. Sadly it isn't the case.

.

Since I've seen automation displace workers and cause mass unemployment and suffering first hand I always urge caution and empathy in the use of such systems. "

GREGORIOtheLION,college,1389168622.0,"Oh my god.  I was exactly where you are, OP, when I was 25.  The only problem is, I didn't do anything about it until I was 34.

Seriously.  My mother passed away when I was 16, and my dad remarried a few months later, leaving me with a shitty brother and some house taxes forcing me to drop out and start working full time to cover half the bills.  Even to this day (I'm 37) I haven't gone one day without a job since I was 16.

Being on my own since then, also means that I kinda got caught up in living check-to-check and didn't think I could ever get a degree.  It overwhelmed me to think about it, so I didn't.

Then, I met my wife.  I was 33 when I met her, and when I was 34, she pushed me to apply at community college.  It's a little silly to do, because they ""accept"" you immediately.  Once they accept you, you can then go see an advisor.  These people are awesome.  They're usually just as excited that you're planning to attend school as you are.  They'll show you all the programs the school offers.  If you want to get a bachelors degree in something, they'll tell you what kind of an associate's transfers to that.  If you would rather work as an x-ray tech, or AC repair tech, they'll show you what per-requisites you'll need to get into an associates in applied sciences degree (applied usually means a 2-year trade degree, meaning you can start working right after).  Either way, just get your student ID number by applying to the school, see the advisor and bring a notepad with any questions you can think of.  You can tell them your interests, maybe what you do now, and see what kind of degree you'd like.  If you don't have a specific career in mind, but you're really good with science or math, aim for bachelors in engineering, math, biology, etc.  If you're more of a words and/or pictures person, a liberal arts general studies, history, English, or business are fairly diverse.

Unless you're really into math, you might need a developmental math class to re-orient yourself with college algebra.  Do not get frustrated with this.  I did.  I actually waited a semester after my wife urged me to attend school, because I felt like I was looking uphill with 2 developmental math classes in front of me.  All you need is a C in those classes because they'll never affect your final grad point average in college.  They serve to prep you for college level math courses, and they'll be over before you know it (and you can take other stuff while taking them).  One more tip in that realm:  If you must take a ""placer"" test at the community college, and it's computerized, you'll have a writing portion.  The tip is this, if it asks for a short essay between 300-500 words, write 500 words.

Sorry about the length of this.  I'm pretty passionate about school lately.  By the way, I went from being terrified to take developmental math classes, to having logged 60 credit hours towards a degree, keeping a 4.0 GPA while doing it, and I just got accepted into UNT here in Texas.  I'll start there this fall.

tl/dr:  Do NOT wait any longer.  Step 1-apply to a community college and get a student ID number (it'll be in your acceptance email).  Step 2-see an advisor at the school and bring a notepad with questions."

Well, there is no doubt that there are (unknown) risks. Often discussed is a terror attack. Also, Kruemmel already had several incidents prior to Fukushima and was shut down earlier.

IndieLady,videos,1389169275.0,"&gt; Why on earth do you think a grown woman (as the one in the song) is incapable of dealing with overeager attempts to convince her to have sex? Can you honestly imagine someone having sex just to shut someone else up? Why do you think that women are incapable of simply saying ""no"" and ending the conversation?

I have explicitly stated that I feel perfectly capable of dealing with overeager attempts to convince me to have sex. *I stated this in my very first comment in this thread*, that I said no. But that doesn't make his repeated attempts any less uncomfortable (because did he accept my no? Of course not, he kept attempting to convince me). So even when I don't ""give in"", even when I amdealing with someone ""overeager"" and feel comfortable saying no, it's still uncomfortable, still icky. 

Furthermore - and this may shock you - some people do ""give in"" and sleep with someone even when they don't want to. It may be your long term partner and you just want them to shut up and leave you alone. You may be sexually inexperienced and don't know how to assert yourself and clearly say no. You may be deeply insecure or vulnerable and don't want to make someone angry, upset or disapprove of you. You may not want to do it but you want to appease your partner. This is the case for women and men.

You have no sympathy for people who relent and give in. *It's their own fault*, *they made a free choice.* I do have sympathy for them. Yes they made the choice (as I've said over and over again I'm not talking about rape) but that doesn't make it any less creepy that one person had to ""convince"" someone else to sleep with them. Let's put it this way, I would never want to put someone in that position. It seems you don't care.

&gt; Listing reasons why sex would be enjoyable (which, by the way is all he does in the song) or saying ""oh come on, please?"" hardly removes the choice. 

That isn't want this song says. 

Here's a sampling of the lyrics: ""You're a good girl / I know you want it / Can't let it get past me / You the hottest bitch in this place / You wanna hug me / I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two / Nothing like your last guy, he too square for you, he don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that / I'm a nice guy, but don't get it if you get with me""

That's not someone explaining ""why sex would be enjoyable"". It's sexually assertive right to edge of aggressive (no I don't want something that will ""make my arse tear in two""). On top of all of that, the song is even called ""blurred lines"", the protagonist openly acknowledges he's not even sure she ""wants it"". 

As I've said, if this were a sexy subdom thing, fine, I understand kink and have no objection to it. But a reflection of contemporary sexuality, this song ain't. If a guy talked that way to me in a club and said those words (I'm a nice guy, but only if you get with me""), I wouldn't consider it ""convincing"", I'd consider it pretty icky, pretty creepy."

Nycamm,Jazz,1389169291.0,"Personally, I'd go about it a different way. You aren't going to find (many) strong examples of jazz/punk ""fusion"". As it's been pointed out before, they aren't exactly closely linked the way jazz and funk are, or punk and metal, which are two examples of genre mixing that happens frequently. If you really want to get into jazz, and I think everyone should, the best way that I can see is to start expanding your listening more gradually, and based off of what you already enjoy. 
Just from my personal experience, I turned a love of Linkin Park and Korn (I know, I know) and Stevie Ray Vaughan into a love of Jim Hall, Bill Evans and Cannonball. It wasn't a direct line, it was more like I reached out musical feelers in every direction. I started listening to more metal, better metal, stuff that experimented with structure and time signatures. I also started listening to more blues based music. Old British rock 'n' roll, Motown r 'n' b, and eventually Delta blues. I developed a taste for music that was challenging and rewarded close listening, and my ears became more and more exposed to both the blues cliches and African inspired rhythms, two very important aspects of jazz music.
Basically what I'm saying is that, while it's great to try to dive right into jazz, and that may well work for you, instead of trying to draw a straight line from what you listen to now to something you aspire to listen to, try to expand your ears and your palate outwards in every direction. Listen to the bands your favorite artists listen to, keep a notepad of songs you hear on the radio/at the bar/at a buddies house that you find interesting, find out what producer or engineer worked on your favorite album and look through his/her resume. 
The worst case scenario doing this is you find a bunch of music you really enjoy and don't get to jazz ever, BUT the music we listen to doesn't exist in a vacuum. Black Flag and Duke Ellington are connected, even if it's a distant connection. All music is connected, but especially music made by people who are from the same century and live in the same place in the world. Just keep an open mind and explore, maybe you'll find yourself listening to (and most importantly enjoying) jazz AND soul AND country AND hip-hop and so on and so forth. That can only be a good thing as far as I'm concerned.

**Tl;DR   Don't worry about finding some kind of ""punk/jazz fusion"", just explore new music you like and keep an open mind**

P.S. I hate the idea of ""fusion"" music, and genres in general. That kind of thing tends to be really restrictive. It's all music!"

Also, it might behoove you to ask for someone to do a direct observation on your urine- this usually is what patients at my job do when they have a normally low creatinine level.

She was then left blindfolded and suspended while Cameron and Janice had sex together below her...she was tortured and kept locked in a box 23 hours a day...Cameron started raping Stan...she was kept locked in wooden boxes under the matrimonial water bed...Janice gave birth to a second baby on the water bed above Stan...she tried to be a good slave and that due to this she was allowed out to jog, work in the yard, and care for the Hooker children alone in the mobile home. Even with an open door, neighbors, and a telephone, Stan made no attempt to escape; she said that her fear of ""The Company"" kept her from seeking help. Stan was even allowed to visit her family by herself in 1981. While at home, she did not reveal the truth about her situation...Her family thought she must have become involved in a cult...[and] did not want to pressure her fearing she would go away forever. Hooker posed as Stan's boyfriend and returned the next day. Stan's family took a photograph of the pair together, which shows them smiling and happy...Hooker feared he had given his slave too much freedom—he...locked her in the wooden box under his water bed; she remained in the box 23 hours a day for the next three years...the temperatures would swelter to over 100 degrees in her box.

It's incredibly difficult for me to ""pretend"" to be interested in someone's conversation, painfully and cringe worthy, ESPECIALLY when it's bullshit about someone else (gossip). I just have no time for that silliness. Unfortunately it is an essential trait to have to succeed in this world. You ever meet someone more successful than you but realize over time you're more intelligent than they are? They know how to shoot the shit. I've slowly gotten better at feigning interest in situations where it will benefit me (usually my career). It's still very painful to do. Of course the best position to be in is when you've met your goals and don't have to fake being nice anymore. Like Bill Gates.

TryUsingScience,changemyview,1389169848.0,"I've gone my entire life without ever cheating on a test. Or a paper. And I've taken a lot of tests in my life, and written a lot of papers. Important tests and papers that determined my future, and bullshit ones that didn't do anyone any good. I have a lot of opportunities for sex, but I would still guess that they will never add up to the total number of times I've taken tests and written papers.

Why have I never cheated on a test, even though it would have saved me time, maybe improved my future chances, and in many cases not really harmed anyone? Because I am highly ethical. I hold my ethics more valuable than my time, my future opportunities, and my immediate happiness. That's not to say I've never done anything unethical in my life, nor that I never would, but I have never and will never cheat on a test. I can't think of the circumstances when the benefits would be higher than the value I place on my ethics.

I say this not to illustrate that I'm some awesomely virtuous person, but to make a point: it's perfectly reasonable for a person to refrain from a type of unethical behavior if the rewards don't outweigh the guilt they'd feel. If someone isn't incredibly sex-motivated and is motivated to preserve their ethical stands and their monogamous relationship, then the downsides of cheating greatly outweigh the rewards, even if the relationship is going through a rough patch."

PixelOrange,changemyview,1389169914.0,"It depends on the type of relationship.

Swinging generally allows for sex with anyone that is also a swinger.

Open poly relationships allow for freedom of relationships, so long as everyone is aware of your sexual activities so they can properly protect themselves. Honesty is a big deal with poly.

Closed poly relationships allow for sex only with people who have been brought into the group. This is similar to open poly except the group usually agrees ""yeah, this person can be one of us"".

I can limit my point to closed poly relationships and still make my case.

I'm a polyamorous married man. I have my wife and I, from time to time, have girlfriends. Why would I ever feel the need to cheat on my wife if I can simply find a girlfriend? In the last two years I've had a total of one girlfriend who has progressed to the sexual stage (I've dated a few other girls but it never really got very far). That was enough for my urges and my wife was content doing her own thing as well.

On the flip side, my wife is monogamous. She's not a fan of poly. She tried it with me for a little while and decided it wasn't for her. She abhors cheating. To the point where a friendship I had with a girl in the beginning of our relationship was ""cheating"" to her because I was emotionally attached to that girl. I was monogamous for 4 years with my wife before we tried polyamory.

Even if we went back to monogamy, there is no circumstance that I can think of where my wife would ever cheat on me. She would rather divorce me than cheat on me. She has no intention of ever being with anyone else because she doesn't like dating, doesn't like very many people, and before me she didn't even want to get married.

I know this is anecdotal, but I truly believe she would never cheat on me. Ever."

The early 00's, saw powerful, 900bhp machines and from '03 onwards, they had a lot of downforce, culminating in the '07 and '08 cars.

Alongside that, the cars were getting so fast that one of them was going to crash and seriously injure, or kill someone.

Armagetiton,woahdude,1389170392.0,"Well, anyone with the Infinity Gauntlet from the Marvel universe can destroy Goku. The relic pretty much gives anyone who possesses it infinite wishes, you could simply will Goku out of existence, not just his physical form but his very soul too. For example, Thanos literally kills half of all sentient lifeforms in the universe with a snap of his fingers while in possession of the gauntlet in an effort to impress his love interest, Death herself.

&gt;The Infinity Gauntlet was designed to hold six of the 'soul gems', better known as the Infinity Gems. When used in combination their already impressive powers make the wearer able to do anything he/she wants.

Thanos was defeated while in possession of the Infinity Gauntlet solely because of his hubris.

Edit: Also, I can think of at least one character that can defeat Goku off the top of my head. Jesse Custer from Garth Ennis's ""Preacher"" could tell Goku to ""go fucking kill yourself"" and Goku would do it. Nothing is immune to Custer's Word, his power is so great that God himself fears it. Custer's only problem is that he doesn't like to use his power, but he does when he has to."

TryUsingScience,changemyview,1389170546.0,"Those are good points. For your first one, let's compare cheating to a much worse unethical act: rape. I think we can all agree that every decent human being can refrain from rape, right? If you're horny and lonely and slightly tipsy and someone who is now clearly drunker than you has been flirting all night but you know they aren't really interested, and now they're practically passed out in your lap... you still don't rape them, because that is bad. Likewise, if you're horny and lonely and slightly tipsy and someone has been flirting with you all night but you're in a monogamous relationship, you still don't have sex with them because that would be cheating.

Of course, that runs afoul of your second point, because in the latter example your potential partner is trying to convince you to sleep with them. And being influenced by others does make things more difficult to resist. But more difficult is not impossible. There are plenty of things our peers try to pressure us to do that we refrain from doing. There are kids who make it through the worst druggie high schools without drinking or doing drugs. There are people in war-torn nations with horrifically racist policies who take a stand. Humans are capable of resisting peer pressure for the voice of their own internal compass.

To review, people can resist the biological urge to have sex when the circumstances would cause it to be an unethical act. People can also resist peer pressure, sometimes under intense, life-threatening circumstances. So there should be people out there with both those qualities who can resist the urge to cheat."

My goal for this game was just to take over all of the Manchu territory, then expand northward into Siberia while keeping peace with my neighbors. Late-game strategy would be to possibly hop over to Alaska and crawl down the Pacific coast as well.

However, through a combination of lucky alliances and fortunate events, I've become one of the primary powers on the Asian continent, and wars have been remarkably fruitful. In addition to the obvious territory you can see, I also have Taiwan and once province of the Japanese mainland.

This surprise personal union with Ming (my first personal union ever) should really help solidify my standing in the world, but I'm leery about getting involved in the politics of southern and south-east Asia. At least the Zhou really love me-- we've fought a few wars together, and we're far enough apart not to get on each others' nerves.

I'm really happy with how things are progressing, but do any more experienced players have advice? Am I missing anything in the picture here? 

I'm worried about the Oirat Horde, but I don't think there's much I can do beyond containing them with my northward expansion. I've never fought a war against them, but they have claims on four or five of my provinces by this point, and I feel like it's only a matter of time.

Men don't see it as an insult.  Acknowledging that some men are deranged, sociopathic, violent, insane, malignant, evil, etc. is no condemnation of all men.  Men understand that all other men are potential enemies."

She was great in bed and we had good physical chemistry but there was just nothing to actually *say*.   I had one sided conversations, being on the phone with her was just dull.  When she wasn't monosyllabic she was just bland.  She'd talk just day to day chitchat about nothing.  I couldn't understand how her job and her sideline would require her to be engaging and talkative (I presumed) but in her own life she was a mouse.

She was very nice and did nothing wrong.  And at first I didn't care because she is hot and I thought perhaps she was reserved and would open up and be interesting later.  But after a year and a bit nothing... she was the same. It didn't go anywhere because *she* just bored me senseless.  "

- Tax is levied on the nominal profit, anyway, so if the value of the nominal profit decreased, then the value of the tax will be lower also.

- A company isn't taxed during all those years it used its capital to increase its size of operations, only if money leaves the company. So they have been able to make use of the value of the capital during all those years, at the value before inflation.

Not completely skeletal but more options), Dwarf (tattoos for Wildhammer etc.), Night Elves (instead of just tattoos on the face for female Nelfs, why not make body tattoos possible for both sexes? If not then these tattoos could be an option if Blizz ever makes a Demon Hunter class). Perhaps even scars. Just something lore friendly with a nice aesthetic that helps to make the character feel more like my character, i.e. My Orc is a Dragonmaw Orc with a large scar across his shoulder from a pit fight, which would be obvious visually with these tweaks.

For example the other day I had a friend saying that quantum physics proved some crazy theory about the existence of ghosts. I haven't graduated with my physics degree yet, so I'm not an expert on quantum mechanics or anything, but I do probably know more than the average person on the topic. I knew from the get go it was BS but went to check to make sure, and sure enough, quantum physics does not prove the existence of ghosts. I just left it this time and ignored them, but felt a strong urge to try and tell them that they were wrong.

So in this situation is it better for me to just leave it and let them believe, or try and tell them why it's wrong?

I didn't say it was all trans guys, I was specifically speaking about straight trans men, and I was making a hypothetical suggestion about that group, and how they may attempt to rationalise their situation - if you are born female and you're into women, you are already out of the norm without adding gender dysphoria, meaning that you may find it difficult to discern further that the feelings you have are gender based, and not sexuality based.

I have PCOS, Autism, and Bipolar. I'm a woman who has a disorder that was known in some research circles as 'extreme male brain', ovaries that produce over twice the upper limit of 'normal' amounts of male hormone for a woman, and my brain periodically decides whether it wants to be super happy or sad with no real causal link to reality. I think I have probably one of the best chances of anyone who isn't actually born the wrong gender of understanding what it's like to have gender dysphoria - in my case, when I struggled with it, it simply wasn't that I was born the wrong gender, I was just born 'wrong', since all of my conditions (including a blood disorder that prolonged my time without hormone treatment) are genetic."

CalvinDehaze,Screenwriting,1389172926.0,"To elaborate on what /u/urmthrshldknw said, screenwriting is an art, but it's not a painting, it's architecture. You wouldn't design one part of the building, then the next part, then the next part, and hope that they all fit together. You start with the whole building, then work your way into the details.
  
With outlining, cards, or whatever method you choose, make sure that you're starting big. Title, main characters, journey. Then work out your act beats. What happens by page 10, end of act 1, 2, and the ending. Then you work out the story beats, then card out the scenes, then you start writing. It sounds laborious, but everything needs to work before you start writing, or you'll find yourself painting yourself in a corner, or getting blocked. And be prepared to go back a stage. You can know a character as well as your own mom, but even your mom will surprise you every once in a while. Sometimes you'll put your character in that scene, and the character tells you what to write, giving you a new idea that you have to re-structure into your script.

TheHolyFool,batonrouge,1389173014.0,"After having two different car windows smashed in the same year -- both times for someone to steal things of little to no value to anyone but me -- I decided it was a better idea to never leave anything in my car, and simply leave the doors unlocked. If they want to see what they can steal from my car, they can just open the goddamn door instead of breaking a $160 window to steal a bag of dirty laundry and a backpack full of German textbooks.

Both times my car was broken into, I was parked in well-lit parking lots on Perkins Road in the historic merchant's district. One of those times, I was parked there for work, between the hours of 4 and 11pm. The petty criminals in BR have no shame whatsoever, and they are bold. You might want to get in the habit of assuming that anything left in your car for any length of time will be gone when you get back, especially if the doors are unlocked... even if you're only in Albertson's for 20 minutes. If anything of value is visible from the windows and the doors are locked, they'll smash a window.

Eggs: Tofu scramble is an easy way to make ""scrambled eggs.""  Google hundreds of recipes.  Also I have a great quiche recipe if you are interested.  Anyway, if you really like that ""egg taste"" you can use black salt (get the right type: Indian stores) which contains sulfur. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kala_Namak.
Nutritional yeast also adds an eggy/cheese taste to things.

Also there is a GREAT new product coming out: ""Beyond Eggs"" by Hampton Creek.  They have a scrambled egg product coming out.
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/23/beyond-eggs_n_3963845.html

For supplements, Pea Protein is supposed to be great, but I am sure there are others.  

Don't pay for cook books, great websites are: postpunkkitchen, fat free vegan blog, etc.  The Engine 2 diet is a ""manly"" take on veganism, as is Thug Kitchen, though I find it hard to navigate the latter website. There are a gazillion posts on /r/vegan in which people lay out starting shopping lists, starter diets, easy meals, etc.  I think I just saw some up thread.   So please scroll around a bit as you are posting at a slow time.

Also, it is easy to eat MOST places.  Seafood restaurants I find to be the worst.  Easiest is ""ethnic"": Sushi, Thai, Indian (watch for dairy), Pizza (just no cheese), Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Mexican....  Steak places you can usually find steamed or oil-sauteed veggies, baked or french potatoes, salad, artichoke starters, etc.  I just had an AMAZING meal at an upscale steak house.  Burger joints can also be hard.  But in general, depending on where you live... eating out is easy.

Write back if you have any questions on this, I just spit it out quickly!  Good luck!

lalicat,AdviceAnimals,1389173227.0,"I think my wife becoming a mother made her so much sexier to me. Sure she isn't 19 anymore, her breasts don't defy gravity like they used to and she's got some stretch marks on her tummy from having two children. She doesn't wear make up and rarely dresses up anymore. Her hair is frazzled often times and she's starting to look more and more like her mother. 

I still find her irresistible, we don't have time for sex as much as we used to with two kids running around constantly. We try to distract them with tv and sneak a quickie in the next room but often times we're unable to finish what we started because of a toddler that refuses to allow closed doors in the house ... something about the way she reads to the children at bath time or the way she gets such a kick out of our kids doing the littlest things like discovering their own shadow. 

Sure I'll give a longer than I should glance at a youthful 20 something every now and then but I'm immediately tempered by the thought of having to start all over with someone new and give up everything I have here, it's never worth it and if anything it really just makes me appreciate my wife even more.

I like to think those laugh lines on her face are from all the smiles I've given her over the years and I adore them and no matter what I'll always find my wife to be the sexiest creature on the planet."

What's the point of your work success when you don't have anyone to share it with, or without someone to simply accept you for who you are, faults and all?

One way to get over it is by looking at the successes we do have, and understanding that our self worth is defined by ourselves, and not others. He's looking at his successes and he's proud of what he's done. He doesn't need someone to validate his worth anymore, and that's liberating."

Dental insurance, on the other hand, is typically pretty cheap through your employer (if they offer it, many don't). I think I pay something like $5 a week for my insurance since i'm paid weekly.

Well I mean, it kinda totally does change it for me. I read the books when I was still a kid. It gave me a story that I knew and loved. The game made changes to that story and it's just a little upsetting. I think this sorta thing just happens when something gets a new media spin on it's existing story. A common occurrence between books and movies. Like Enders Game, and how things were changed... that just irks me.

For me the tale of reach was tragic because it was a sudden assault on these character's home. The UNSC's hasty defense seemed so dire and important. I think the game subtracts from my previous experience by rewriting a little bit of the canon.. 

I know it's not a huge deal, and I'm not going to fuss anymore more it. I just wanted to put it all out there.

With v-sync off, the rendering and scanout are entirely independent.  The result is tearing at all frame rates. (Or as I prefer to call it, garbage out.)"

porpoiseoflife,Chargers,1389174472.0,"Ever wonder why we keep signing off our posts with ""Fuck The Raiders"", even though we won't be playing Oakland again until next season? Well grab a beer and sit down, because I'm going to fill you in on one thing that most people around here will assume you know already.

The Chargers and the Raiders have been playing each other continuously over the last 52 years. Along with the Broncos and the Chiefs, we in the AFC West are the beneficiaries of the second-longest uninterrupted divisional rivalry in football. Only the fabled NFC North has been together for longer, and they were four of the first teams in all of professional football.

There was also a relatively brief period when the Seattle Seahawks were members of the AFC West, but the league finally punted them into the NFC during the great reorganization of 2002. We only talk about them when they do something special. (Division champs with a 7-9 record? Yeah. That was real special.)

Some of the most controversial plays ever recorded have happened in the AFC West, most particularly the infamous Holy Roller. (The link that /u/shunned_one posted below has a video of that, so I won't belabor the point.) Some of the strangest finishes in football have happened in the West. (Succop? Succop... I just about had a heart attack while that kick was in the air.) This division makes football history, and not a single season goes by without that history deepening yet again.

And we passionately hate each other. 52 years is enough time to develop a lot of hate. And the AFC West knows how to hate. The only thing that any three teams' fans will agree on is that the fourth team sucks. Usually, that is concentrated on the Raiders. 

Don't get me wrong. We hate the Broncos and the Chiefs, too. But the Raiders have a special place in our boiling cauldron of bile and infamy. And it will always be so. This is also found throughout the League. 31 teams will gladly say ""Fuck The Raiders"" at any given opportunity, and with a frequency second only to ""Fuck The Cowboys"". But we in the West have earned well the right to say it, and we exercise our rights as often as humanly possible.

So the best lesson to learn is this: Fuck the Broncos. Fuck the Chiefs. But always, always, always, until the ends of the earth and the heat death of the Universe...

**Fuck The Raiders.**

And welcome to the best damn fans of the best damn team in the best damn division in football."

Now, I realize, as an adult (and vegan), that taking care of your health is a good thing.  I have swayed many people to eating ""plant-based"" for purely health reasons as I am the most in shape person they know (and I never exercise...).  So, to answer your question: I am a SUPER healthy vegan.  I aspire to the Eat to Live type of eating.  My meals for the past couple days are homemade: split pea soup, butternut squash soup, sweet potatoes, eggplant, guacamole, etc.  My vices are coffee with sugar and soy creamer and way too much drinking. 

But it sounds like your initial introduction was through health, so of course that would be your perspective.  If it was purely about animal suffering then, bring on the donuts.

TheOutcast,india,1389174517.0,"&gt; Is it wrong if Modi talks about development? Should he also act as ""Secular"" and talk about relegion?

I'm saying exactly the opposite. Modi is doing the right thing by not playing secular politics (hence my India first point), and they need to stress it. I'm not ruling out a conspiracy. And AAP is known for this dramatist behavior, and they have learned damn well how to play politics from Congress. But BJP needs to tackle this, or file a defamation case in court and screw them if this had got nothing to do with them.

&gt; Even there is no denying that Sheila govt. was involved in corruption. Why does Kejri asks for proof even after repeatedly telling pre election that he has proof against the Shiela govt. himself.

I have criticized that as well here. Why do you think I'm turning a blind eye to that?

&gt; I can't see how you are doing it differently. Even you are choosing to be naive.

See my point on the defamation. BJP should reply strongly to put these accusations to rest. I'm tired of shit like ""RSS blaming"" by Digvijay and their ilk like no one else, but I'm frustrated as to why BJP takes it all. PM called Modi a mass murderer in his press conference. Come on, man.. At least take them to court.

&gt; Bottom line is everyone is playing politics, real dirty politics. One should see whose politics is acceptable according to your POV. Rather than criticising others and forcing other to flip to your side.

Agree with you. And I'm not asking you to switch sides."

Indoors, I aim to shoot at at least 125 s⁻¹, and outdoors I usually use 250 s⁻¹ or higher. Are you using autofocus? With most modern DSLRs, the viewfinders and focusing screens really aren’t large or bright enough for precise focus.

Also, if you don’t mind some free advice: Take advantage of your camera’s automation. For most ordinary lighting scenes, your camera’s matrix metering mode is going to be more accurate than you, and more importantly, it’s much, much quicker. You know what aperture you’d like to shoot, so set your camera to aperture-priority mode (**A**) and let it pick the shutter speed. Also, auto ISO is a really great thing.

When I upgraded from an all-manual film camera, I kept shooting everything in full manual. I thought I knew what I was doing. I can’t tell you how many shots I missed because I was fiddling with my controls (and I knew them quite well), how many shots I ruined by poor metering (*e.g.*, spot-metering on someone’s face and completely destroying some important highlights elsewhere), and how many times I’ve simply had suboptimal settings (*e.g.*, 1000 s⁻¹ with ISO 3200 for a static subject).

You don't get to have it both ways. You either need a man to take care of you or you don't. And personally, I don't think you do. Ultimately, any girl who has the view that guys should pay for more things than girls belies the fact that she thinks the woman is the more valuable partner in the relationship. That is simply untrue. Guys that date you are no more lucky to date you than you are to date them. And by the way, when you end up in a long-term committed relationship (maybe even marriage) the two of you pay for what the two of you need together (and more often than not, the guy kicks in more money)."

This is a ska/punk/hardcore/whatever song I'm working on with the intention of using this recording as a demo for a band I'm hoping to get together. I did this all in about the span of 12 hours. The guitars, bass, and organ are all played by me, while the drums are done via VST (but I tried to be tasteful with the use of velocity and expression to prevent it from sounding to machine-y). I tracked it in Cubase Artist 7 and used EWQL Ministry of Rock 2 for the drums.

As a caveat: I am not a particularly good guitarist or bassist. My primary instrument is trombone. Hence, there are some slight hiccups in the rhythm of those instruments. (I didn't have any issues maintaining my tempo on the organ, though.) I still need to record vocals and a couple horns, probably trombone and trumpet.

Euryleia,KerbalSpaceProgram,1389175904.0,"Cosine loss is basically how much of your thrust you don't actually get when your rocket exhaust isn't pointed straight backwards from your direction of travel.  If your rocket engine was pointed sideways, you can burn it all day long and you won't proceed forward at all.  If it's at an angle between sideways and straight back, you get some, but not all of that thrust moving you forward.  For example, the old NASA Space Shuttle had a lot of cosine loss because its main engines had to be fired at an angle while it was taking off due to the imbalance of the shuttle being on one side of the big tank and boosters with nothing on the other side to counterbalance it.

You probably had ""control from here"" on your rocket in such a way that ""forward"" was not what it normally is, so with the rockets pointing sideways or backwards, MechJeb was telling you you'll get no ""forward"" delta-v at all.  Doing ""control from here"" such that your forward direction once again matches the way your rockets propell you would have shown correct delta-v with cosine loss still checked."

Many of them also sell terrarium kits. With a glass bowl, a little time and a little money you could have the ultimate geek terrarium. The one terrarium piece I couldn't fine was *Doctor Who*...which is surprising given etsy's obsession with everything TARDIS. I did however, find the most awesome [TARDIS in a terrarium print](https://www.etsy.com/listing/120698383/tardis-terrarium-doctor-who-blue-british).

I'm relatively new to RAOA so if you're shared personal info before, I'm not aware. But if you tell us what you do, or how you plan to use your office, we might be able to find more specific niche things.

Half horse is remarkably hard to find. There are a massive tonne of horse bookends, but almost none are split. I did find [this](https://www.etsy.com/listing/118671663/equine-collection-hunter-jumper-horse) though--that's an etsy seller who makes a few different ones, but they're both expensive and not quite the right style, though the seller does do custom pieces.

Not cause and effect and really, but also super cool: [rabbit pushing bookends](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rabbits-Pushing-Books-Bookends-Set-Pair-book-ends-), [star wars at-at bookends](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014XR1XG/).

Oooh, wait though. I managed to track down the [artist who did those two pieces](https://www.etsy.com/shop/KnobCreekMetalArts). They have an etsy store and so many split bookends: [father pushing daughter on the swing](https://www.etsy.com/listing/168890667/swinging-metal-art-bookends-), [sea serpent chasing a ship](https://www.etsy.com/listing/125711387/sea-serpent-metal-art-bookends-free-usa), [UFO abduction/fleeing people](https://www.etsy.com/listing/93673592/ufo-abduction-metal-art-bookends-free), [dog pissing on a fire hydrant](https://www.etsy.com/listing/93597379/fire-hydrant-metal-art-bookends-free-usa), [tentacles attacking a pirate ship](https://www.etsy.com/listing/111045664/tentacle-pirate-ship-attack-bookends), [zombie attack](https://www.etsy.com/listing/94877994/zombie-metal-art-bookends-free-usa) and so many more. No horse leaping, or cowboys, but the artist has a horse in [this one](https://www.etsy.com/listing/100649085/headless-horseman-metal-art-bookends) and they take custom orders. 


Other cool stuff I've found:

Life-in-Death,vegan,1389176562.0,"Edit: All of your questions have definitive, non-speculative answers.  They are below.  
I know this is late, but please read. 

1 . Yes, they have nerve cells, just like we do, and they serve the same functions of the nerves we have.  One of the most primitive sensations is to feel pain, because it is protective.  In my graduate intro neurobio course, we started learning about molluscs (as in snails, not octopi) as simple organism to study pain.  It is completely accepted in the scientific world that molluscs experience pain.  They have the same nerve structures and show the same reaction to negative stimuli.  Very simplistically: in 8th grade we were required to dissect live clams.  They were squirting water at us in defense.  They don't want to be sliced into.  So, don't do it.

&gt;Evidence suggests that nociceptive processes in primary nociceptors are highly conserved across diverse taxa, making molluscs attractive models for biomedical studies of mechanisms that may contribute to pain in humans but also exposing them to procedures that might produce painlike sensations.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21709311

&gt;Slugs and snails posess an opioid receptor system.[56][57] In experiments on different terrestrial snails, morphine prolonged the latency of the snails' raising their foot in response to being placed on a hot (40°C) surface.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_invertebrates

So in short, they suffer when you hurt them, and they have instincts to survive.

2 . 
&gt;Most ""regular"" animals people eat are killed through more instantaneous methods.  

First, PLEASE divorce yourself from this belief.  There are no stealthy ninjas with Phenobarbital sneaking up on pigs.  Animals are shoved in to terrifying pens or transported to slaughterhouses, strung upside down, stunned to stillness then killed.  And that is at the best.  Kosher and Halal meat involve slitting the throat and letting animals bleed out. 

If you have a question about ""how would something affect killing this animal,"" remember that humans are animals too.  Is it better to torture a person less before killing it?  Sure, but, it is still wrong either way.

3 . Where do they fall on the spectrum?  They are animals.  As mammals are.  Cyanobacteria are protists, bacteria are bacteria and yeast is fungus.  They are distinct groups.  Vegans believe you should avoid eating all animals.  The rest are what's for dinner.  If you are looking for a ""where do they fall"" it would be more useful to look at the spectrum of the Animal Kingdom of which they are a part.  It can also be hard to categorize this way as closely related groups can differ widely in sentience and cognition (For example, oysters and octopi are both molluscs).  Yes, I would kill a sponge instead of a pig if I had to choose, but the moral choice is just not to kill either.

4 . I answered most of this question in #1.  But the short answer is:  It looks like they feel pain, they have the same parts that we do that feel pain, so they probably feel pain.  It would be scientifically ridiculous to say: they have nerves like we do, respond to pain medication like we do, respond to the same kinds of pain that we do in the same ways that we do, BUT it is most likely something different.  Functioning systems are conserved in biology.  

Also, the question is if we SUSPECT that they feel pain but we can't know for sure, wouldn't that lead us to the rational action of avoiding possible harm?  If I think this chemical is toxic to a person, but am not positive, the only rational choice is not to give the chemical!

The only reason people fixate on the pain thing is because *we can never know.*  I can never know if my dog feels pain, or if my baby does, or even if you do.  Maybe you are having some other reaction that you just assume is what everyone else calls pain!  Maybe you see yellow when I see blue!  It is freshman metaphysics 101 nonsense.  

If you have ANY questions on any of this, please ask.  And skip the oysters, give the poor guys a break..."

I'd say that yes, sex defiantly gets and feels better with age but a lot of it might just have to do with being comfortable with myself.

Being able to have a healthy relationship with someone is something you need to learn at some point in your life, and not learning it from your parents doesn't necessarily mean you cannot learn it later on.

3. Rick only had one IV bag to live on by the time he woke up, so this only gives us a couple of days.

Of course, it's just a show and we can't expect everything to be medically accurate. I'm a nurse so I'll pick at a few things: He had no feeding tube, no TPN running for nutrition. He had no foley catheter, or any urine collection device, or even any pee stains on his boxers! Super unrealistic!

People act differently when they get around the same crowd as they did in high school. They regress to that high school care-free attitude.

I won't even begin to pretend that I understand anything about why our brains do that, but I do know it's a thing that happens to a lot of people.

Slyfox00,AskReddit,1389177915.0,"It's a reddit thing. I spend time mainly around queer subreddits like /r/lgbt /r/ainbow and /r/actuallesbians

This subject comes up often.

From my experiences the mtf reddit population is more vocal than the reddit ftm population. This is just my observation, and a large simplification of the matter.

Some reasons that seem most probable to me are visual and societal issues. Different groups under the larger queer rainbow umbrella just face specific challenges. One example: I beleive people on reddit that are ftm have a more difficult time being gendered wrong in day to day life, which leads to the higher representation in post volume.

There are tons of factors in play here that i can't hope to understand or explain them all.

In reality the two groups are roughly the same in numbers. There are also other gender minorities that don't fit into those categories.

Even if the representation is a bit skewed here on reddit, needless to say there's still totally a subreddit /r/ftm

Lost_Afropick,reddevils,1389178068.0,"Kagawa is not a center midfielder.  His ideal position supposedly is as a second striker, dropping deep.  We've used him mainly in wide positions.  So he doesn't count.

Fellaini hasn't performed well.  Supposedly we got him as a defensive screen.  To sit in midfield in front of the back four and break up play.  But at Everton he was used as a target man in a more advanced role and that's where he was effective.  Everton knocked balls up to him and he held the ball up and waited for others to join.  This encourcages long ball football which Utd fans don't really want.  So Fellaini and Moyes have pretended the big Belgian is defensive as a player.  He isn't.  He isn't disciplined (prone to cards) and rash in the tackle.  His defensive reading of the game isn't that good either.  He was a buy for the sake of it.  I've no idea how he will fit into a Utd team.  After spending 27 million or whatever, we're stuck with him though.

Jones is a center back.  He's ""done a job"" in midfield and a good one but it's to the detriment of his own natural game and progression.  He should be in defence, especially with the poor performances there from others this year.  Evans has regressed for some reason.  Last year I was a believer in him but now... Lets see if Jones can do better with a good run of games at the back.  The thing is we're playing Jones in mid and not the back because we lack real options in mid.  That's not good for the guy.  

Cleverley is supposedly attacking but actually creates very few chances himself.  He just runs about and hands it off to whoever is near him.  He looks neat and tidy occasionally but doesn't bring any ideas or openings to the party.  He isn't top team quality really.  He could be replaced.

Fletcher has just returned from a long term illness he hasn't quite shaken off.  Whether he could possibly return to the dynamic player he was in his heyday after such a long time and especially at his age now is doubtful.  I hope so but I'm not holding my breath.  Either way he isn't to be called on week in and week out.

Carrick plays defensively very well.  I have no problem with Carrick.  Last season he was probably Utds best player.  I find criticism of him annoying.  He certainly doesn't need replacing.  But he is ageing.  His weakness is when he's under close quarters pressure, he doesn't hold the ball well in tight spaces (as evidenced by two Barca CL finals and Benfica/Bilbao games) but that is a problem only because there is so little quality around him that he tries to hold on to the ball.  With better players Carrick too would shine.

United need both a defensive screen AND a creative force.  And they need them to both be grown up starters with experience and class already.  Not potential youngsters who could become players.  Utd need right now players.

Also the wingers haven't been mentioned much but they're all underperforming too.  I can't remember the last good cross I saw that actually met somebodys head in the box.  Young and Valencia especially need to look at themselves."

&gt;WOTC's business model is finally starting to crumble

Not really, it's always been possible for people to make very, *very* good copies and proxies of cards. The vast majority of people will still gravitate towards buying real cards. That said, if and when the printing process becomes absolutely the same as with WotC's cards, you start to run into a whole new shebang of problems.

Vintage, Legacy and to some extent Modern are suffering from horribly steep entry fees. This will remain a bitter prong in the flesh of people like you *(and me)* who just want to play the game. I'm *locked out of Legacy* because I'd rather not spend thousands of € on cardboard I'd get to use once or twice a year. It's just fucking ridiculous. If Wizards adamantly keeps refusing to print Legacy staples -- even if gold bordered -- it's only a matter of time before *someone* starts to print them. Print shops in China and Russia won't give a shit about American Cease &amp; Desists.

&gt;How many more people would play MtG if the barrier for entry weren't so ridiculous? 

I think you're looking at this the wrong way. You have to remember that the entire business model of Wizards revolves around **people buying booster packs.** Every live broadcast from PTs, every release, every preconstructed product, each &amp; every article on the Mothership and the public personas of Wizards employees is geared to do one thing and one thing only -- **to keep players buying booster packs.** So the thought process would go 'Should we sell singles?' --&gt; 'People would just buy singles and stop buying packs, so no.' 'Should we sell preconstructed Legacy decks?' --&gt; 'People would just buy them, then stop buying Standard-legal cards. No.' it all revolves around that. They're pushing the boundaries on what they do slowly, but it's a long process."

In that case they might simply arrest you on suspicion of committing the crime, or detain you without charge for whatever the maximum is. A few hours I think.

Police tend to use judgement on these issues though, people looking shifty, people who aren't from the area, people running, known faces.

If they just search you without permission or a warrant, that's illegal. The best course of action there is to let it happen then complain.

friendlyDilemma,AskMen,1389178970.0,"My ex, with whom I've spent 5 years, hardly had any friends of her own. The ones she did have, she'd see and talk to on rare occasions. So when it came to going out and partying, I gladly invited her to come with me, and over time ""my friends"" became ""our friends"", because I(We)'d meet with them every week, sometimes even more often.

This situation was pretty cool, though sometimes she'd act pretty clingy (""I'm bored, so you should come see me and abandon your plans""). She'd be upset because I wanted to have a night with just the guys or have a game night or whatnot. However this was not a big problem, as this behaviour didn't occur often. What's worse is what came after we broke up.

Since everyone was ""our friend"" it became a pain for me showing up at common gatherings. Since she was the one who dumped me she was having a pretty good time (at least on the outside), while I was miserable most of the time. I had a few nights where it'd be just the guys and me and it was great, but in any case, she'd refuse to skip a gathering if I was there (and I didn't ask her to, btw). What's even worse, is that a ~month after our break up she started dating one of my (now ex) friends. 

So basically I noped the fuck out of that group, if we take it as whole, and only regularly see 2 maybe 3 people individually out of a bigger circle. I didn't have to do that, of course, I could've just accepted her new relationship, moved on and continued attending gatherings and being miserable, but fuck that, a month after 5 years wasn't enough time for me to do that. 

To answer your question OP: It didn't bother me before, but now I would be very careful to not turn all ""my friends"" into ""our friends"". It's great to have mutual friends/acquaintances, but past experience has made me quite wary.

Death_Urthrese,leagueoflegends,1389179745.0,"- not counting timers on jungle buffs
- if you are a laner it is not the junglers fault you got ganked and died and it's not his job to win your lane.  it is your job as a laner to kill any jungler invading your jungle as those are your buffs he could be taking.
- a jungler doesn't have to gank to be effective, they can spend the whole time farming and be more effective than having a bunch of failed ganks.  
- complaining about ks's.  they died, you didn't, that's all that matters.
- focusing the tanks in teamfights just cause they were caught first, save your abilities for the carries.  if the tank blew their abilities already they aren't as scary
- supports exhausting the enemy support when they initiate, once again the supports abilities are gone, you need to exhaust the one doing damage over time.
- not pushing objectives after getting kills
- not taking every chance you get to damage a tower
- not pushing a lane after a successful jungle gank
- having multiple people push the same lane when one could go to another lane
- not understanding minion waves, lane pressure, how to make large minion waves, and how to freeze them and when to do so.
- level advantages are what win you early game
- not immediately grabbing an ability and level 2 before your enemy and forcing a tough trade on them
- counter picks are not as good as comfort picks
- gank from behind the enemy in lane at mid and not through river
- going back to buy too early and too often when you could spend that time farming more or ganking a lane
- blaming others when you can't carry a game yourself
- pushing the lane with the inhib already down when they should push another lane
- if someone is split pushing just make a play 5v4 and have someone tank the turret
- adc's job is to attack and poke objectives more so than get kills
- ward farther up river so you see the enemy on his way to you and not as he's already there
- grouping up when you have a team that doesn't accent that type of play, ie two assassins on the team.  (you pick someone off then push obj, don't group and push)
- CS is more important than harass
- if you harass and miss CS you miss the point of harassing
- if you just got a triple kill at top and you see the other two on bot, don't recall just because you are low on health. push a tower or objective.  
- creep damage only happens when you auto attack in a creep wave and don't take any extra damage in those waves at early levels
- if you aren't confident you can win lane then just passively farm, it's better than losing lane and feeding
- if you do lose top lane then switch your build to what you need and not just what a site says
- if a team is stacking a resistance like MR early then void staff is more worth your money than rabadons.  that being said void staff and last whisper should be your second (maybe third at the latest) item  usually on your carries.  by the time you finish it they'll have just bought defense items.  
- if your team is behind just farm and you will catch back up
- a kill is worth about as much as 17-20 cs or so.  if you have 1 kill but are down 25 cs you aren't really ahead
- knowing when it's safe to harass and safe to gank.  if you gank mid lane before you bait out fizz's trickster it's not your mid laners fault
- knowing when to leave lane.  if you have 25% health, no pots and your opponent is a burst mage with flash and ignite up, you should probably leave.
- there are a lot here but honestly the most important thing to remember is have fun.  play for yourself and try and see how you can improve.  if someone flames just mute them and keep on playing.  pretend everyone is a bot and you'll feel better in game."
MrVuule,Warframe,1389179786.0,"This was my starter frame and played him for about 30-40 hours before switching. After switching to different frames I never really understood the appeal of Loki. 

But now that I have put in countless hours of extra gameplay and hearing about Loki being able to perma stealth, I might go back to this guy at some point. (Mainly because I really wanted the stealth ninja warframe Ash, and after finally getting Ash, I didn't nearly like him as much as I thought I would.) 30 seconds stealth, low energy cost and a heavy hitting weapon should easily do the trick. And as much as I thought his 4th skill was a bit useless, turning a Corpus/Grineer defense mission into a wannabe Infected mission sounds really nice.

You seem to forget to look at the forest and not concentrate on the trees, we live in a time where markets are mutated by special interests and failure isn't permited. In such flawed conditionts, to advocate non-interventionism to reignite stale markets is retarded.

I will stress that if you apply a slight pressure to an asshole it will gradually expand itself to an remarkable degree and I've actually found anal can often be easier than vaginal because of that! Toys really make a huge difference, fingers do work eventually but a set of butt plugs and a dildo make it so much easier. If you can get your partner to wear a decent sized butt plug for a reasonable amount of time before you even try anything then you might find the experience is transformed. Occasionally nothing will work at all because the guy is too nervous or inexperienced but you'll learn to avoid feeling so frustrated.
  
Being thick can mean we hit guy's prostates easier and at the very least you'll be a memorable fuck :). Just having a thick dick will get you plenty of hookups if you're that way inclined but you will get turned down based on your size too and I've never had a 'proper' blowjob. There's good and bad, you've just got to play with the cards you're dealt.

So until we have an immigration system that works perfectly, the state governments which are not totally capable of removing the illegals need to help mitigate the damage they are doing. One such set of damages they do is driving. Not only are they not taught the rules that our licensed drivers adhere to, they are not insured, so when they do eventually cause a traffic accident, no one is able to pay for damages caused.

Also, Nuvaring, and I love Nuvaring! However the two combined (I think - not a doctor) really lowered my sex drive.
Just out of forgetfullness (and a small desire to not have to ever take medicine) I stopped taking Sertraline a month or so ago. 
And next Monday I'm getting either Mirena or Paragard. I'm leaning toward Paragard because it is non-hormonal. I like being clean off medicine and continuing to eat healthy and exercise as a healthier way of managing my anxiety &amp; depression. 
From there I will evaluate my mental health with my doctor and see if I'm still managing well or if I need to continue Sertraline.

If you are friends with that person, then you still do have an emotional attachment to them. it isn't a relationship, but it is still something that you can savour. HOWEVER, the FWB relationships I have had started out as that, and we were not regular friends beforehand, which probably would make things problematic.

anonlymouse,changemyview,1389180105.0,"At the low end, it's less expensive to be a woman. You can find good clothes in a thrift shop, due to women buying more clothes and donating good as new articles, while men tend to wear out what they have. Food is on average more expensive for men as we are bigger and need to eat more, and this is a recurring cost that you can't get around. It's also much more feasible to find cheap rent as a woman - you can find affordable rooms in a shared apartment or house that are female only. There aren't any male only rooms, and the ones that don't discriminate are more expensive. So if you're trying to be frugal, just for food and rent, men are paying 50%-80% more. If you're on minimum wage, that's the difference between being able to afford to eat out and go on a date once in a while and having to rely on the food bank to not starve. If you're unemployed and on welfare, it's the difference between being able to live in a clean room, versus a vermin infested one to barely be able to afford food.

Once you start moving out of trying to find affordable housing, and are actually going for renting your own apartment, the gap narrows. Rent is equivalent, food expenses are still higher for men. If you're on a date and being fair, you'll end up paying less as a woman because you eat less. Splitting the bill evenly would also be fair, as you still have lower overall living expenses (bras aren't a real recurring cost, sanitary napkins are, but you can stock up on them when they're on sale - they don't take up a lot of space and aren't perishable). Hair cuts aren't any more expensive if you have short hair, and there's nothing stopping you from keeping it short to keep costs down if that's what you're concerned about.

Once we go higher with rent, cost difference flattens out, but by then it doesn't matter, as you're already making enough to not have to worry about getting ahead, and you can easily afford to pay for everything, and if you want to be fair you still split the bill, or simply whoever makes more pays."

I'm not saying anybody should be ill-treating people who are in need. They should be helped. But by saying HELP they need to listen to everything what is told to them by those who try to help. 

You may be a person who really struggled. What about people who ""struggle"" just because they are fucking lazy? They have money for fags and beer but not for bread or milk? It's those who are real problem and those people later make bad opinion for others who may really need actual help.

I was very shy and quite young, meaning this was a big deal to just walk in and ask for a job. Few weeks later I found an advert on Pizza Hut restaurant and just called and left a message. They asked me for an interview and I got the job.... Later in life I was investing in myself and constantly trying to look for other jobs, better paid and less demanding.

Tell me now and I'm not asking you. How many unemployed people would say ""shitty job"" for delivering newspapers or doing kitchen porter or some other low paid but hard work jobs and not even do it to earn money for basic food and shelter but stay in line for benefits from the government?"

rynchpln,AcademicBiblical,1389180732.0,"The word logos was a loaded word at the time which was used by many people. I think it works best to realize that words go through different developments in different locations. It is nearly impossible to pin down the author of the gospel's exact influence as it could have been coming from any number of directions in the Roman Empire. The author I read the other day traced the word from Socrates into Philo's mouth then to John.



&gt; Hellenized Judaism in Alexandria eventually found its greatest teacher in the person of Philo Judeus (c.20 BCE–c.50 CE). Philo was a philosopher who sought to render Jewish thought intelligible to educated Greeks of his day by interpreting the biblical message in ways that were consonant with Greek philosophical concepts. The stories in the Hebrew scriptures were to be understood as allegories, he explained. They represented in symbolic or spiritual form the truths that Greek philosophy grasped through reason. Philo used the Greek concept of the logos (“reason” or “word”) to link the creative work of the God of Israel with the Greek concept of divine reason. In his Timeus, the Greek philosopher Plato had described the logos as a divine principle or pattern found throughout the world. Philo identified this with the word of God that was found in the Hebrew scriptures, thereby building a bridge between Greek philosophy and Jewish thought. It was a bridge that many generations of Christian theologians later walked as well, borrowing Philo's allegorical method as well to interpret the meaning of scriptures.

I think I saw it tried once in a pro game, and the defending team just warded their own jungle and forced the jungler back to the other jungle, instantly winning the lane.

1. Aggressive jungling is easily countered, especially when the other team has three heroes in their safe lane.

2. Chen/Enchantress have weaker lane presence than traditional aggro trilane supports, and make the trilane even weaker because they must occasionally leave the lane to get creeps. Wildkin tornadoes and harpy lightning provide amazing lane harass, but you're gambling if you're expecting to get your hands on one of those. The other neutrals are great for ganking and pushing, but not for lane presence.

3. The point of an aggressive trilane is usually to fight and contest the opposing team's trilane; bringing an easily countered hero with mediocre lane presence who won't even be there all the time is counter to the purpose of an aggressive trilane."

DuneBug,lotro,1389181225.0,"Only real problem is Turbine's lease on the LOTR IP ends sometime soon I believe. Like within the next year or two...

Endgame is really weak right now so you'll miss out on what a lot of people experienced when it was 60, 65, and 75.. Obviously those can still be run, but it's hard to find a group without including some level capped people that will make it too easy.

Having said ALL that... I was trying to describe to my brother how cool it was to run around in the LOTR universe and play around. He was playing SWTOR and I tried that and just didn't feel immersed... But earlier in the game I just enjoyed getting lost in strange areas (like north of bree) while questing just to see what's there, and you end up running across some cool landscapes and scenery.

Some of the later areas don't seem to have that feel to them... Or getting lost will get you killed by some mob meant to be killed by 3-6 people, and that's not much fun. 

Run through levels 1-30... Which should take you around the shire, bree, and into the lone lands (weathertop). When you get to the trollshaws(Rivendell), that area is very pretty, but an absolute pain to quest in... I would avoid it and go to evendim. You might be able to just follow the story line... 

Buy VIP when you get through the lone lands (the last free zone) and continue questing until Moria without having to buy anything else. Alternatively you can buy quest zones with turbine points... But if you don't plan to do many run throughs on different characters i don't know if that would be worth it. 

I think at this point I own every zone except the trollshaws, because i hate them."

Although I agree with the point you are trying to make, the quoted statement is fundamentally wrong. 

*it reinforces false stereotypes*

Firstly a stereotype is based on truth but there are the odd cases where it is a fallacy. But you can't reinforce a false stereotype because then it'd actually be a stereotype that isn't false. 

A better way to put it is that there are a group of shameful and loud mouth Maori that are creating the stereotype and lowering the image of the Maori that function like the humans that they are. "

Now, given that you've flashed your device with ROMs and stuff it's probably rooted but you don't have the application to control it. SuperSU is such an app, it can be found in the appstore [HERE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu). Now, SuperSU should be able to access root just by installing it like that but it doesn't work for all phones (on my HTC One i need to flash it from recovery, this is why i forgot to link this in the first place), but maybe for you it does and it's easiest to try that first since it can't do any damage. 

So, install the app from the playstore and see if it works. If you get an error (something like ""binary not found"" or ""binary out of date"") post here and i'll help you flash it.

Even if everything works i still suggest you head down to xda and read up on all things concerning flashing, roms and roots because it's quite dangerous to not know what you're doing next time when you tinker with your phone. Unfortunately, this side of android is quite hard to ""learn"", even more so if you have no experience with programming, linux and lower-level computer stuff in general.

It's a really sucky situation, and no one can tell you what to do. Any decision you make can be argued as right or wrong. In my situation, I waited a while and my dad ended up figuring it out anyway.

Here's my main point: You need to take care of **you**. Your parents are grown ass adults and it's not your fault they suck at marriage. *It's not your fault.* Don't let this bring you down! Just focus on becoming the best adult you can be.

Once again I'm sorry this happened and hang in there the best you can friend! Feel free to pm me if you ever need to talk."
gerusz,AskReddit,1389181820.0,"Well, there *must* be one person you're the most compatible with.

You'll also probably never meet that person.

And compatibility has a diminishing return. While you might be somewhat happier with someone you're 99% compatible with than with someone you're 90% compatible, the difference won't be as much as, say, between 90% and 81%.

Plus, depending on your and the other person's stability, the same person can be a 95% one day, a 97% on another day and 93% on yet another one.

And as a corollary, the person you're most compatible with can be a different person every time you check.

Hell, there might be some days when you're lucky enough that the person you're with actually is the person you're most compatible with on the planet.

So yeah, while ""the One"" exists, looking for them is pointless. In this case, good enough is good enough.

HumanSockPuppet,TheRedPill,1389181855.0,"I have yet to meet a woman who has willfully subjected herself to any degree of duress for the sake of wealth, power, or social success. It's not that they aren't capable of doing it (in certain fields), but simply that they don't *need* to. Women have more options - easier options - for achieving these things.

**Women play a different game - a safer game.** The rewards are more assured. The male libido puts female sexuality is in greater demand, thereby giving them greater leverage. A young, beautiful woman needn't become an engineer when cam-whoring will pay her just as much, and with much less hassle.

It is also the female aversion to risk which accounts for the great disparity in male and female aptitudes. Male morphology - his superior strength, his greater capacity for logic and abstract thinking, and his will - is the result of nature selecting for those individuals who took risks. Female selectivity drove males to take greater and greater risks, pushing their morphology towards the limits of possibility. Those men who didn't push up against the limits would be passed over for sexual selection. Our battle has, historically, been a genetic battle of necessity.

**People choose the paths that gain them the greatest reward for the least amount of effort. Women will never ""win"", because necessity doesn't require them to.**"

If we agree that religion should be viewed negatively, then the strident calls from some theists to label atheism as a religion is a great example of a [tu quoque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque) fallacy.  Even if atheism were a religion, it would not justify religions to commit the same mistakes.

&gt;I know that when it comes to my religion, Judaism, that the majority of you look at us as a cult in one form or another

I view Judaism as no more of a cult than any other world religion.  The term [cult](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult) can refer simply to a group of people who worship a god.  The term can also refer to a group centered around a charismatic leader.  However, the term is most commonly used by *theists* to create a taboo around novel religious movements.  In that context, I think that referring to any religion as a cult is unproductive.

What do I think? You don't know anything about the game, so the obvious draw would be to see you learn and move around. This should be emphasized with the following:

* Use WASDF+space for movement in addition to the mouse. This is much easier on the eyes and to follow.
* Speed things up. A lot. In the video you spend a lot of time durdling around and doing nothing, you could've taken those bits and speeded them up 1.5x-3x to make your 18-minute video a 10-minute video and much easier and interesting to watch.
* A day in Don't Starve is real life 8 minutes, so you should plan around that. If you can't condense 4 full days to 16 or at least 20 minutes, you're probably doing a lot of boring stuff you could skip over. You should try to find something new every 2-3 minutes of video. I found myself skipping ahead 3-4 minutes because BORED and found you did nothing in that time anyway.
* Get the minimap mod. It makes following you around much easier.

Since you'll probably want to learn things by yourself to make the videos interesting, I'll keep the spoilers to a minimum:

* Cook your food
* You only need light for the DARK part of the clock, ie night *(see upper right corner)*, not dusk *(red part)*.
* Once you die, might want to consider switching to Long Day, it makes starting out and exploring a lot easier. I also personally hate squinting at the screen. Once you hit mid- to endgame it actually starts to be a hindrance since you need dusk/night to do certain things, so don't feel like it's ""cheating"", and for the beginning and learning the game Long Day is really good."

Oh, are we going to pretend that **afros** aren't a reference to black people?

Berean_Katz,DebateReligion,1389183302.0,"Well, as a secular humanist/skeptic, I don't really subscribe to Taosim, but it was still one of the philosophies that really fascinated me as a teenager (yes, you read that right). I think the problem people have is that they just don't understand it. When it says not to value things, for instance, it's not saying that you shouldn't *value* it per se, but rather to recognize that nothing lasts forever. People get hurt too easily because they are too attached to the people and things they love, so we have to learn not to cling too tightly.

Also, when the Tao Te Ching talks about ""not doing,"" I think it's talking about becoming so vanished into whatever you're doing that you don't even have to think about it. Self-consciousness is completely absent and you become natural and free-flowing. Like if you've seen that movie ""Peaceful Warrior,"" when the protagonist was taught to focus on the moment, he was able to perform his gymnastic exercises better than he ever did before. Another more mundane example is if you were eating cereal and you suddenly started to over-think how you coordinate your body to eat, thus making a regular everyday activity become somehow difficult. Basically, don't over-think. It's a philosophy for the self-conscious. I had a problem with this philosophy because it sounded like anti-intellectualism, but I don't think that was Lao Tzu's intent. 

Bruce Lee was also interested in Taosim, and when he talks about ""being like water,"" I believe he got that philosophy from Taosim, though I could be wrong."

And one doesn't wake up and suddenly is an adult. They gradually become more independent, get a job, have their own apartment, pay their own bills. And since people are always growing and learning (well some do), then they are always maturing, thus maturity may not even have a clear end point.

With my best friend(s), the cuddling was organic. We super shared, broke down, hugged it out bro, and then realised that was quite comfy. She isn't even a touchy feely person at all, so that was surprising. My other best friend is a guy, but he has a GF now, and I have a BF, so the cuddles stopped because that might be weird for them. SUPER hugs are still on. We got our cuddle on the exact same way - we were both letting out all our hurt and secrets, and we just *needed* to fucking hug eachother, and then we were like, meh, this is nice, let us do this again and again. 

For me, cuddling is an extension of security. If you have good platonic love, a cuddle is just the physical manifestation of the trust in your friendship. 

Cuddles will most likely stem from emotion, so if you have a female friend you're close to you could even be honest and just say ""it would be nice to be held"" and if she's me, she'll say ""Yeah okay you weirdo, what's up"" and then all the cuddles. But that's just me, and as I said, I never looked for the cuddles to be honest. They came to me.

PixelOrange,AskReddit,1389184427.0,"Yeah, he is a shock jock. Aren't all talk show hosts? Their goal is to get people fired up so they come back, get better ratings, and get paid lots of money.

I remember the first time I heard Rush was when I was a child. My grandfather would listen to him. My grandfather was racist (which was odd because his best friend was black), and definitely angry about the current state of affairs. He wasn't a mouthbreather or a knuckledragger though (and I realize you weren't personally insulting my grandfather).

Fortunately, my grandfather was also able to think for himself and that taught me a lot (because at that young of an age, I was impressionable and could have been won over by Rush). My grandfather would call Rush out when he'd start in with the bullshit. It'd be funny to watch my grandpa listen, think, turn off the radio, and then go into why Rush was being a fucking moron today. But my grandpa was an ultraconservative so he'd still listen. Although I'm sure he listened to democrat shows as well. He was a pretty wise guy for his time and liked to be informed.

Anyway, that's enough about gramps. :) I'm nowhere near the level of conservatism as him. I'm more of a moderate. There's things I care strongly about that are conservative views and things I care strongly about that are liberal views."

Emotional caution is not the same as not intending to have a future together. Doesn't he have reasons to be so cautious? 
Be careful not to assume things without evidence or you could really screw things up. 

&gt; When should I call it quits if he's not willing to give me the security I need? 2 years, 3 years?

Are you saying a wedding ring is the only form of security you understand? 
People can be committed without a wedding these days, you know. This is not the 1950s. 

&gt;  I resent his degree of emotional cautiousness and I would be more willing to give up than to wait.

Not trying to be mean, but think of this. If you are more willing to give up, perhaps it is you with the commitment issues. Perhaps you are desperate for commitment for some reason. If you are willing to give up so easily you are not LTR material. To be fair, this guy does sound like he's not sure what he wants.

I think you also need to pull back from this friendship. He has a right not to be attracted to you, for whatever reason. You are not ugly, and I'm sure that isn't what he said (if he did he isn't as nice as you think). But being around him will hurt your self-esteem, which you need to work on. Focus on your other friendships and draw back, get some space. Consider dating other guys when you feel a bit less raw (don't jump in too soon). If your friend asks what's going on, I'd suggest telling him the truth. You should not have heard what he said, because it wasn't intended for you, but it was still hurtful. If he's a good friend he will understand and give you the space you need to get over this.

Anyways, part of the condition that they would honor existing memberships and keep the golf course open and all that. 

Well the group that ended up buying it agreed to said terms and literally within a week or so of closing the sale announced that they were going to close the country club and course and build houses where the course is. Naturally this pissed a bunch of people off. THe members and Neighbors  sued them for violating the contracts The buyer counter-sued since they snuck some wording in the contract allowing them to do it. and then bam the financial crisis hit. they then cancel all plans for development due to the buyers group going bankrupt. The Neighborhood association has been unable to raise the funds to buy it back and the lawyers or whoever is in charge of this can't find a buyer for heatherwood country club.

During high jump in grade 5, he said his cousin could high jump so good he could jump over the school building. THE TWO. STOREY. SCHOOL. BUILDING.

In grade 6, when he was 10 years old, he tried to convince us that on the weekend he carried a 2 ton fence post from one side of his farm to the other. 

In grade 10 he said that he was 3 metres (10 feet) tall, with true conviction. I'm not tall myself, (about 6 feet tall) but I could easily look down on this guy. He argued with us for 5 minutes, even though we told him that being 3 metres tall would make him the tallest man on earth and that half the guys were taller than him, he wouldn't have it. 

In grade 8, he tried to convince us that everything at his house is cooked on a cement frying pan. A concrete frying pan. Luckily we were in science and the teacher had a heat conductivity website handy. Surprise surprise, cement is nearly at the bottom of the chart and would be useless to cook anything. The teacher was the first one to laugh at him.

But here's the big one. This kid always said he was colour blind. We didn't not believe him but understandably, we didn't believe him fully after his history of bs. So one day we bring up a colour blind test on the internet that has false ones mixed in to weed out liars. Instead, we told him that the real ones were the false ones and the false ones were the real ones. He ended up getting the real ones right, and the false ones (that even a colour blind person could see) wrong. When we called him out on it he told us to shut up and went out of the classroom.
 
Think I'm done? No. This guy. Next day we bring it up to him again, and you know what he says? ""Oh, that wasn't me, it must've been someone that looks like me in the class."" That is literally what he said. It was a class of 7 people, none of us looked anything like him. It was a high school of 40 people were no one at all looked remotely like him.

*Double Indemnity*  - no quote, because if you haven't seen it, it might ruin it. Barbara Stanwyck is amazing in anything she does, and man..... Don't mind, me, I'm jut over here, drooling.

Parts of that sound familiar to me.  They remind me of an abusive relationship I was in some time back.  And there's a reason; you're in an abusive relationship too.  And a *much* worse one than I ever was, you poor sod.

Still, the core issue with my old relationship is that she would promise all sorts of subby things, then when the time came to do them she'd just...refuse.  And not refuse in some sort of fun ""oh no master, *please* don't touch me there"", but in an angry, annoyed, frustrated way.  Ugh, no, of course she didn't want to do that.  But when called on it, she'd agree that yes, okay, she *did* want to do all that stuff, just not now.  Maybe this weekend.  Yes, definitely the weekend.  But when the weekend came, she had firm plans to hang out with friends, but you know, next week would be great.

And so it went; I was in a nominally serious D/s relationship, but no actual D/s ever took place.  Hell, once the initial bloom was off the rose, no actual *sex* took place; just a steady stream of promises that things would be different Real Soon, and absolute refusal to do anything sex or kink-related whatsoever, at all.  And if I tried to push it, she would get quite mad, refuse to be touched in any way shape or form, and in extreme cases, would storm out.

And the thing is that this wasn't *just* a really boring and frustrating relationship (although it was!), it also made me really doubt myself.  You read kinky erotica, or watch kinky porn, or talk to kinky people at munches or on here or on Fetlife, and you get this idea of How D/S Should Work, and then you go talk to your nominally devoted sub, and...none of that seems to apply.  You start to wonder:  Is it you?  Is kink something that actually happens?  Are you just a terrible dom?  What's going on?  Is this just how your life is going to be?

And the answer is no, it's not how things actually are.  Those really nice sub girls you talked to?  They're almost certainly really nice sub girls.  And no, your currently partner is never going to be like that.

In theory, I guess, you could maybe fix things with couples counseling.  But 1) that's really amazingly, super hard, 2) good luck finding a kink-friendly therapist, which you would need and 3) well, not to be harsh, but is she even worth it?

My advice is to just walk away.  Tell her goodbye, if you're living together move out or kick her out, cut all ties, block her on facebook, stop talking to her, and spend a few weeks getting your head on staight.  And then when you're looking for your next relationship, you'll have a wonderful idea of what exactly you are looking to avoid in your next partner.

(Also:  My current partner is a serious brat, but she's also a wonderful, (eventually) obedient girl who is very, very submissive to me.  What you have isn't a brat; I'm not sure you're even dating someone who is submissive in any sense of the word.  What she is, is an abuser.  Don't conflate them.  There's a big difference between someone who simply doesn't care what you want or what you say, and someone who would rather die than disappoint you but *still* likes to skate on the thin line between ""annoying Daddy"" and ""Daddy fetching the hairbrush"".)

TL;DR:  I've kind of been in a similar place to you, and holy shit does it hurt.  But it gets better.  The trick is to figure out what you want, and then find someone who can give it to you.  You've done the first half, I think; now it's time for the second half.  And I really don't think your current partner is it."

For me, physical cheating is not as huge of a deal as emotional cheating. If I had found my boyfriend was talking intimately and sharing his deepest self with another woman I would feel so betrayed. However I feel like there could be reasons he physically cheated. Perhaps he was drunk and confused etc. I don't know. I guess sex to me is important but not as important as an emotional connection, once that is broken I don't think it can be rebuilt. At least for myself.

quick edit: What ages are you? Because I was like that when I was younger. As I've aged I realize what is important to me and what isn't. If I saw my boyfriend holding hands with another girl it wouldn't phase me. I might ask him why he was doing that but I wouldn't be angry.

These guys have so much chemistry and skill that they could make a run at the medals. Robert Kristan in goal is one of the most experienced goaltenders in the tournament, and I think even though they play in tough Group A, they could beat two of the three teams and end up in a good position to make a medal run.

Edit: The defense for Slovenia is absolutely the best it's been for years. Pavlin and Gregorc really can tear it up on defense too, as they've been skating in the Swedish/Czech leagues.  Watch this first line to have a VERY good +/-. The second line shows that they can take a lot of minutes as they were both in the IIHF world championship.

ctesibius,MechanicAdvice,1389185509.0,"No, it's the cold that did it, that and an aging battery. It may be better when it warms up, but a cold battery produces less current. The worst case is if the battery was already almost discharged, as that would make it more likely to freeze, and this could burst it. Probably best to check that there's no leakage of acid , and if there is, remove the battery and flush with lots of water.

As to the lights, /u/derphurr has the right calculation (actually his figures are rather conservative). They don't draw enough current to cause this problem."

Im not drawing conclusions here, im opening up a line of enquiry. What i want to establish, is what the effects of testosterone are, and how they vary by geographical location. The above implication about locations and aggression, recruits locations as evidence of gender being a social construct, i wish to debunk this, using the location/aggression thing *against* that argument not for, and this will involve taking location/aggression ans showing a small percentage of this, would be explained by genetic predisposition to testosterone levels in the local populace.

Its not switching 100% social construct, for a 100% anything else, im trying to show even a fraction of a percent influence of testosterone on aggression by geographical location, would disprove the social construct argument.

Let me clear that up for you :

(a) You're going to need a file browser with root privileges (i recommend [Root Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrummy.root.browserfree))

1. Download video player/music player apks

4. Reboot to recovery
5. Wipe cache, wipe dalvik cache (DO NOT WIPE DATA)

In the last screenshot LiteTouchMedia.iso is for burning onto CD/DVD, the directory Content contains the files needed on a bootable USB (make USB bootable, then copy the CONTENT of Content to the USB, not the directory itself).

Does it make sense? Yes and no. For mass deployments USB and CD/DVD are probably still best, there will probably be network bandwidth issues if you try mass deployments over the network. 

However considering the odd PC that refuses to recognize CD/DVD's or USB's, having WDS gives you another option. The same goes the other way as well.

For the long term, WDS is probably best, or you'll end up with lots of different versions of windows on cd's and usb's (and there is always this intern who doesnt check if he is installing the correct version). WDS makes it alot simpler to guarentee consistent deployments."

Speedzor,AskReddit,1389186432.0,"A small explanation for most of them (except the prolog one):

&gt; There are 10 types of people in this world; those who understand binary, and those who do not.

Binary code has only two values: 0 and 1. The binary system counts using 2^x for each of the intermediate values. 
You can then construct any natural number with the remainder.

2^0 = 1  
2^1 = 2   
2^2 = 4   
2^3 = 8  
2^4 = 16  
etc

We can write this down as such:

8421  
0001  
0010  
0100  
1000  

Only the indices that have a 1 count. 
In the example we have `10` and once I tell you that you read from right to left in binary, you can see that we're talking about the second value: `0010` which translates to `2`.



&gt; An SQL query goes into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, ""Can I join you?""

The joining of datasets in a query basically combines the two sets and groups the data on a specific condition.

&gt; [""hip"",""hip""]
&gt; (hip hip array!)

An array is a datastructure that holds values. Ergo an array of two values ""hip"" and ""hip"" means you've got a ""hip hip array"", wordplay on ""hip hip hooray"".


&gt; int getRandomNumber()
&gt; {
&gt; return 4; // chosen by fair dice roll
&gt;           // guaranteed to be random
&gt; }

What you would expect from a method that claims to return a random number is that each time you call it, you get a random number.
Here it returns the same number each time, but the author claims it is random because he role a dice once and it said 4.
Obviously that is not what we meant.  


&gt; Command line Russian roulette
&gt; [ $[ $RANDOM % 6 ] == 0 ] &amp;&amp; rm -rf / || echo Click

% is the modulus operator. It determines the rest after division by the second parameter (here: '6').
So if a random value (I assume $RANDOM generates a random value) is divisable by 6 (the modulus after division by 6 equals 0) then it will execute the second command which is basically 'wipe my disk'.
If it is not divisible, it will display 'Click', just like Russian roulette.

dHarmonie,polyamory,1389186631.0,":( distance is always really hard and very emotionally charged. I just moved back from a year of living about 4 hours away from my SO and started a new relationship about 6 months into that year. It wasn't an unreasonable distance, but it sure sucked not having them nearby during NRE.

I was a field site for school that had totally crap cell phone reception so I completely understand how it feels to send texts into the void. If your partner has occasional access to internet, maybe send him an email? Write a handwritten letter to him and give it to him when he gets back (if you feel like it. I write a lot of letters I never send just because I re-read them and think 'hmmm maybe not'). Changing the medium of communication can really affect how you perceive the distance. Texts/ calls are instant, and you expect to hear back instantly. Emails have a turn around of hours to days, while handwritten letters have the expected response time of days to weeks to never. I found that writing silly emails or letters to my partners helped me feel closer to them when we couldn't talk, especially when I was dealing with the ups and downs of a new relationship and the stress of school.

Biggest piece of advice is to not feel like these emotional ups and downs are 'wrong' or that you are being unreasonable towards your primary. Distance physically hurts. It'll be over, it'll be done."

I doubt he wants to deal with Samantha and all this nonsense either. He's family too, call him in as backup. I know how things can get with family, and how emotional and irrational people can be. If you think you might want to hand the phone over to someone who won't be guilted, draft him in as your standby. My partner does this for me and it's a huge weight off my mind. "

GeoffreyArnold,short,1389187039.0,"&gt; I never understood this notion of being ""more-confident"". When you're more confident not because you are, but because you are trying, it always comes off as fake no matter what height. Confidence is attractive when it comes from inside because it is associated with a whole bunch of positive attitudes which eventually define masculinity like being in control, taking charge if a situation, or being a leader which all require confidence. When you ""fake"" confidence you're basically being inconfident since you're not confident enough in your own abilities. 

I'd take it even further.  I'd say that ""confidence"" (as it is used in these discussions) is merely a byproduct of social privilege.  People are responding positively to the social privilege, but they ascribe it to ""confidence"".  That's why ""confidence"" from a person with social privilege is deemed genuine, while ""confidence"" from social oppression is deemed ""fake"" or blustering.  "

skfoto,askcarsales,1389187080.0,"LTV means Loan To Value, in this case they're letting you borrow up to 110% of the car's value. For new cars they use invoice (before rebates), for used they use wholesale book value.

If 1% under invoice is $39,500, then invoice should be about $40,000. That means 110% LTV would be $44,000, which is where they'll cap you on the loan. If you're putting $7500 down you'll be well below that limit. 

If your sale price had a rebate in it, you'll need to add it back to the invoice to figure out LTV- i.e. $2000 rebate makes it $42,000, * 110% = $46,200. Not that it matters since you're so far below it anyway."

Do you really not understand how being told your natural hair looks like cake could feel like mockery? Especially to people who get mocked for having ""nappy"" and ""bad"" hair, who constantly get reminded that black hair is not as desired as white (or Japanese) hair.

Did the car smell really strongly of air freshener? Smoke smell can be removed (eventually, takes a long time) but what I'd be more worried about if you suspect they're hiding something is a water leak.

* Why nationality matters here even though a person pays UK taxes and nin?
* If make a change make it equal for all, meaning no CHB even for Brits, whose children currently live abroad;
* Why children cannot get money just because they live abroad? Child Benefit is not a support for housing or earning living (like HB or child and tax credits). It's just a support for a child, wherever it is as long as at least one of his parents works in UK;
* So is it better to ""force"" children to be in UK and this WILL cost much more (other benefits, NHS, housing, schools etc)?

I took a pregnancy test, it came back positive, I told my work the next day. I hadn't even gone to a doctor yet. My boss had to know and had to help me keep my safety at the forefront.

Now...exercising is typically a good thing! But at certain levels, and degrees. If you've already been so active then you should be good to continue regular activity, but at a pace that will be more comfortable to you. Most really good trainers will have a plan in their back pocket for pregnant clients. You might be able to still run the marathon! Just talk to your doctor and trainer and make a good, sound plan.

The thing im more than likely going to find, is that its neither completely one nor the other. There are plenty of genetic traits between races, there is lots of scientifically measured distinction between various races. While at the same time, the division, and subdivision in races, gets bogged down to the point of lending credibility to race being a flawed classification.

I will probably want to finish on whats to be gained and what is to be lost, in the use of either generalisation, and i'll probably try and represent the middle as i always do.

The battle's already lost i'm afraid. DRM is coming to HTML video/audio elements. Apple for one have a massive vested interest in it because they need to build bridges with studios to help gain the publishing rights they need for their next-gen streaming platform. Google will equally have a vested interest here.

Unfortunately, the MPAA are holding all the cards. Vendors need to keep them sweet, else sour the relationships their upcoming streaming platforms will rely on. Netflix is about to get a *lot* of competition and the winner put simply, isn't going to be the most innovative party but the one with the most high-demand content licenses."

sporadically_rabbit,anime,1389188087.0,"The highest number of shows I've ever watched at a time was one season where I had 13 shows going (4 ultra-long shounen [ULS], 2 double-cour second halves, 6 seasonal airing, and 1 backlog), and it was just too much.  These days, I tend to keep it quite a bit lower than that.  For most of this last season, I'd only been watching 5 (2 ULS [the others ended], 1 currently airing, and 2 backlog), but that's gone up to 7 at the moment, but that'll only be for a short while, because I'm specifically trying to get through all the shows from last season that I didn't watch and have deemed worthwhile now that it's over).  It pretty much tends to be the same pattern as this last season (2 ULS + 2 airing + 2 backlog +/-1).

As for episodes/day, I've never really been much of a marathon watcher.  Probably the fastest I've ever gone through was when I was catching up to date with One Piece (the most I ever probably did was about 12 in a day - it took about 3 months all up), and at the end of each of the FMA series (probably watched the last 6 or 7 episodes of each show on their own respective day).  As my E/D count increases, I do tend to find that it's harder to remember details, but there are times when the storyline is interesting enough that you really want to watch it and find out what happens *right now*, and these tend to be harder to forget.  On the other end of the scale was one show (which I've ranted about enough already previously) that I powered through the second half because I felt like I needed to watch it, despite not liking it, and decided to just get it out of the way as fast as possible.

Side anecdote: when I was watching Katanagatari, I resolved to never watch more than one episode of it per day, because A) They're already double-length; B) It's the sort of show that really needed some time to let the implications of character behaviour and development sink in."

Unlike his student Plato, Socrates never actually ran a school, preferring instead to teach in public areas. Understand he didn't really teach lessons in the way we understand, he never held a class. He and his students would wander Athens having detailed discussions about morality and life. When they encountered an outsider, Socrates would likewise critique the beliefs of that person, leading him to be quite an unpopular figure in his city. 

His student Plato, and in turn his student Aristotle, took a more traditional route, running schools and tutoring the sons of powerful Greeks.

If the people calling the shots don't care, the company isn't allowed a stance, if the company isn't allowed a stance then people view it as not caring, which results in nothing.

So, basically, there's not much plot or romance to speak of. Occasionally, there will be very small hints of romance, but they're mostly crushes/unrequited love/infatuated stalkers (in the last instance, it's played for laughs) and it's rarely, if ever, focused on. Plot-wise, as I said, it's mostly episodic but there are a few more serious story arcs that are a few episodes long each, but they're scattered throughout the series.

I know that a lot of people struggle to get into it and don't really like it until several episodes in. For me, at least, it took me about 20 episodes. I was ready to drop it but kept going and found myself enjoying it a lot eventually."

W-Z-R,PurplePillDebate,1389188366.0,"&gt; ""Every girl I know is actively repelled by guys using overly-aggressive approaches and canned stuff"" 

TRP doesn't necessarily encourage canned-lines, however the issue is the perception of overly-aggressive approaches. If you ask any girl of course she will claim to be repelled by ""overly aggressive approaches"" because two out of three of the words in the sentence have very negative connotations. A man could approach the girl who just said that with a lot of confidence and she would very easily frame it as ""confident and self-assured""




Of course some will be made-up but it is highly likely that they are a minority, I mean even at school the deadbeats with serious chutzpah managed to pull shit like that on hot girls all the time, it wasn't even a big deal it happened so much. If it didn't work I would make a sub called /r/flowersanddinnermlady and help men get the girlies using beta game (that is if that's what women responded well too). There is also a selection bias on TBP where the least likely stories are shared more than the most likely ones. Another issue is that if you have a very bluepill mentality, the idea of having a sexual experience with a girl very soon after meeting her might seem very unlikely in itself. I will admit that the times where TRP mentality was used and the guy didn't get the girl are probably not posted and generally forgotten about and it is possible that this stuff only works on a subset of women and that those women might actually be the sort you would want to avoid for long term relationships."

By the end of the 8th season, almost everything that could have been done with the characters had really been done (JD was with Elliot, Turk was head of surgery, Dr. Cox had lost his misery, Kelso's role was basically just spinning wheels) and the only way the show really could have continued without re-treading was with the new set up.

It honestly sounds like you're nice and genuine, so you probably won't do any of this, but just in case... here's some tips for messaging:

* Read profiles. So many times I've had someone ask me something that I've pretty clearly already answered in my profile, and it's an instant no. If you don't have the time to read my profile, I don't have the time for you.
* Furthermore, make conversation. Don't use generic pick-up lines, or just open with ""hi"".  Instead, if I mention liking a TV show that you happen to love, talk about it! Ask open questions.
* Don't move off the dating site too early or too late. Your first message shouldn't be asking for my number, but we shouldn't have to chat for weeks before we meet. In the past I've personally found 3 or 4 messages before exchanging info is good. 

Do try to have a few different photos of you as well. Nothing shirtless (unless appropriate, e.g. a shot of you at the beach), not *too* many shots of you with beautiful women, and try to show off your face and also your body.

Honestly this is all very nitpicky. You sound nice, and even if you had just what you've written above, I'd give you a shot.

Good luck!"

TheEggKing,whowouldwin,1389189144.0,"&gt; Tolkien might have been a genius, but at least in my opinion, he is not a good writer.

I remember trying to read the books when I was around middle school age and just being unbelievably bored by them. It felt like every rock and pebble had three paragraphs of history being laid out, and I found myself silently yelling ""Come on, I get it, the place is fucking pretty/ugly, move oooooon"" way more than one would like. I've long told people that I just couldn't stand how Tolkien wrote, and it's nice to hear I'm not the only one.  

I was also wondering something based on a comment you made above regarding Gandalf versus Saruman.  

&gt;Well, now it was Gandalf the white against Saruman the White and Gandalf fucked him hard. Without even really fighting, Gandalf broke Saruman's staff like a twig. That was the difference in power. That was because he was now less restricted.  

Okay, if the colors are supposed to represent limits on the individual wizards' power, then wouldn't a battle between two White-level wizards be closer to a draw? I'm just thinking that if the color represents their power level then White on White should've been even, shouldn't it?"

No, dude, get real.  The Afro trend in Japan is a form of blackface.  It's definitely associated with black people, and definitely kinda racist as well.

&gt;Japan doesn't exist within the social order of the US. Japan doesn't have a history or memory of black slavery and there's no reason to assume any black people who live there did either.

But Japan has consumed a lot of American culture, and a lot of Japanese pop culture references American pop culture.  You're nuts if you don't think they pick up some of our racist attitudes about blacks.

&gt;There's a possibility that someone could be offended by this, yes. But that exists with almost everything. The chances that this is a product of racism is so close to zero it's not worth having an argument about.

A product of racism?  Man, it's not about whether anyone *intended* to be offensive, it's about if the *ended up* being offensive.

Fuck.  I am so sick and fucking tired of white people's complete inability to have even a fucking **shred** of empathy for black people.

Kaisharga,asexuality,1389189339.0,"What's the common phrase? Bros before hoes? Yeah, that's a common saying because it's a wishful-thinking lie. American culture very much demands that romantic/sexual relationships be held in higher regard and receive greater priority than any other, barring possibly high-level business relationships. So yeah, you're not far off base that way.

But that doesn't mean your friendship with her is worthless. You should talk to her, tell her you feel ignored, and see if you can take a walk with her (maybe wait a day or two when it gets warmer...) to talk about it, have a heart to heart. Nothing will be the way it was before--which you knew already--but she may be able to help you in smaller-but-still-signficant ways. Don't let yourself fester on this; it's important that you talk with her about how you're feeling about your friendship.

Eventually you'll have to move on. Such is life. Find some groups about town that have similar interests--and I don't necessarily mean ""join a club"" or whathaveyou; just go places that have the things you like and do the things you like there. Books? Go to a bookstore and hang out while reading a book you just bought there. Food? Go inside and order instead of doing the drive-thru. The point is to be around people, if only just a little bit, to allow those chance-meetings to occur again like they did with your group of roomies. You gotta have someone close, and your friend doesn't seem to be able to be that for you anymore, so your best interest is in finding someone new to be there for you.

Isis also has interruption cc with her silence, so i don't think she's lacking in crowd control. remember, this also acts as a slow AND steals enemy protections. the issue here is knowing when to wing flap. particularly during her early game, you need all 4 flaps to hit the minions as a priority, which leaves you practically a sitting duck while you channel the ability with only a very slight variation in where you can duck and dive to, so you have to be careful with it until you have the pushing power to make some gutsy plays.

I agree with the spirit ball. even at 50 ping it's very difficult to hit close targets. double tapping the keyboard is sometimes too fast to register and it'll sail on past the target.

My first car was a [1965 mustang](http://i.imgur.com/5zUImNg.jpg) which I eventually sold because it needed body work (rust bubbles starting) and I didn't the time or money to fix it.  I ended up avoiding that problem by going fiberglass with my [1977 Corvette](http://i.imgur.com/xLyVHRG.jpg) .  I've been driving the vette for 3 years now, and it still works great.  Keep in mind, these were my only cars.  I also have a motorcycle to save on gas in the summer.  Sure there are some drawbacks, but I never understood why ANYONE would buy a brand new car.  My mustang was purchased for about $9,000 and years later I sold it for about $6,500.  The Corvette I purchased for $6,500.  Sure, there are drawbacks to owning a classic car, but you can't really find anything to compare to the character/price.  people are paying $15,000 MINIMUM for a brand new bottom-of-the-line car.  I realize that there are some drawbacks to buying classic cars.  My mustang didn't have A.C.  My corvette is not as safe as a modern car.  Still, when it comes time to sell them, they won't depreciate much (especially in contrast to the price I originally paid).  

Not to mention my insurance.  You'd think it'd be insanely high, but my insurance is under $100... FOR 6 MONTHS! (yes, under $20/month.)  I'm sure it varies on your area, record, how far/often you drive, etc.

GeoffreyArnold,short,1389189934.0,"&gt; Yes they are oppressed. These people are still being murdered for these traits, these people are still being thrown out on the street for these traits, still being denied jobs with a clean record more than an unmarginalised person who has a criminal record, still being wrongly accused, still being paid less on average, still being disproportionately more raped than other groups, and still being the victims of hate crimes and violence. There are institutionalised power dynamics which compromise the rights and autonomy of these people. That's fucking oppression.

Short people are likely more likely to be murdered, more likely to be homeless, we are denied jobs with a more impressive record more than tall men with less impressive records, we're still being paid less on average, we still have a disproportionately higher suicide rate than other groups, and still being the victims of social derision and violence.

Also, the framing mattered - the BB arena itself was built very solidly, but at one of the other smaller competitions I attended, the frame holding the Lexan wasn't quite as stiff; one 340lb robot scooped up another, ran the length of the arena, and collided with the wall at full speed, and it warped it enough to pop one of the panels out and drop the bot that was being pushed halfway out the hole.

* studios will try and milk it.

Haha! Wow! If you actually wait for her then I feel really sorry for you. She's doing the most selfish thing imaginable. If she was truly *that* conflicted over the two of you she would take a break from both of you to sort her feelings out.

She's trying to get back together with her ex and see how that goes. If it's successful for her then she's going to forget all about her feelings for you until she hits another lull in her relationship and needs a distraction. If things don't go well she's going to run to you as a consolation prize. 

She majorly screwed you over. She should have either not told you about the feelings originally, cut off all contact, or break up with her ex and give it awhile to reassess her feelings. She liked the attention and the excitement of a new romance. If she cared about *either* of you she wouldn't have handled things the way she did, especially now.

What if you two were getting back together and she just strung her ex along in case things didn't work out? That's not fair to either of you. She's being the shittiest ""friend"" and ""girlfriend"" imaginable.

If that happened, and your bitcoins got mixed with some that were bought at low prices from someone in a country with high tax rates, you could suddenly owe a huge chunk of it in taxes."

If I stab you or beat your brains out I have to be right there and watch the light fade from your eyes.  I have to deal with the fact I just killed a person.  Guns to an extent make that a bit easier because you can be metres away and kill a guy and you're removed.

itsnotgoingtohappen,relationships,1389190513.0,"First: 

&gt;He said that his girlfriend is away and always fights with him, which he finds annoying. 

BIG RED FLAG. Yes. He's a jerk because he is more annoyed than he is understanding. You have insecurities to deal with, and you're 19. That's totally normal. What's not normal, or at least what's not okay, is that he's throwing his hands up in the air about them instead of addressing them with you.

To that end, go work on you. If insecurities are THIS prominent in your relationships, you probably shouldn't be in one. You can't be happy with someone if you can't be happy with yourself. If you NEED a relationship to feel good about yourself, that's an even bigger sign. Relationships should be based on mutual want of each other, not need for personal validation. It seems like that's what he's seeking and to an extent, what you're seeking.

Second:

&gt;It read just like the conversations we used to have when we first liked each other and were excited to be getting to know each other. 

This COULD be a red flag depending on one factor: was he with someone else when you first met? Or was it just the flirtation and excitement of something new that you're referencing here? If it's the former, no wonder you're feeling insecure about the relationship. If you were ""the other woman"" to start with, there has to be a little something in the back of your head saying ""it can happen again,"" and that little voice would be spot on. 

**At the very VERY least, take a break to figure out why you have these insecurities.** Have they only come up with him? Or have they been a consistent factor in each of your previous relationships? 

If it's just him, let it go. Leave the guy and take all your awesomeness with you. It may hurt because you may love him, but there's much better love to be shared if you feel insecure with him. 

If it's not just with him, work your insecurities out on your own for a while. Pick up a hobby that's just for you, that makes you feel empowered and proud of yourself. Do something that makes you feel pretty. Go hang out over at /r/makeupaddiction or /r/randomactsofmakeup and share a B&amp;A - both of those subs are among the kindest, most uplifting spots on the internet, even when constructive criticism is provided (and constructive criticism is almost never provided when it's not requested).

And here's the kicker: once you have confidence behind you, you'll see through this kind of crap before you get really involved and you'll find it easier to say ""Yeahhhh, no, this guy is a jerk and isn't worth my time."" OR you'll feel like you're worried for nothing because you know what you have to offer and that any guy would be lucky to have you (and any guy who would blow it is a moron). Confidence seems to be the key to having a well-tuned ""picker.""

I hope this doesn't come off the wrong way - it's not your fault that he's a jerk, and it's not your fault that you're feeling this way. You have clear evidence that he's at the absolute very least inconsiderate of your feelings and the privacy of your relationship matters. However, you will save yourself so much heartache later on if you put your own happiness first and let the rest follow. "

I'm not sure he's as quite as good as Forte, Charles, or McCoy (he's not quite as versatile), but I have no doubt in my mind that he would thrive as they have if used in a similar fashion - getting him the ball on a variety of carries and passes. This year, it was either inside runs or the occasional screen pass. We almost never saw any designed routes or runs outside the tackles, which you would think would obviously be in the mix for a back who specializes in the open field. And while it makes sense to have Greene handle the goal-line and short-yardage work, I do think CJ has a point about coming off the field for entire series. Sometimes there did not seem to be any rhyme or reason to the rotations employed. These were major reasons why many Titans fans (at least from what I can tell) wanted OC Dowell Loggains gone. 

I've always liked CJ for his honesty, and I respect him for not raising these issues during the season so as to minimize the amount of distractions they would cause.

- There is often more tension than action, as the important parts happen quickly. It's not luck that allows the good players to hit their throws when they do, it's timing and sensitivity--admittedly, these are mostly invisible to spectators, the same way spectators can't see how a batter decides to swing at a pitch until the replay.

- It can be more exciting to watch lower-level players--you never know what's going to happen. People make more interesting mistakes and leave themselves open to more varied techniques. Judges at the lower levels are also more willing to let things play out if they go to the ground sometimes.

Edit: As if to demonstrate my second point, /u/fintip posted [some video of himself in a tournament](http://www.reddit.com/r/judo/comments/1uq8y3/my_last_judo_comp_this_past_november/) with annotations.

chewylewis,veganrecipes,1389190651.0,"My favorite quick and low budget meal is a grilled tomato and basil sandwich.  You can dress it up when you want to splurge by adding some vegan cheese every once in a while.

* 2 slices of thick bread, like sourdough
* 1 roma tomato, sliced
* handful of basil (fresh, or about 2 teaspoons of dried)
* seasonings like dried oregano, salt, pepper
* a splash of balsamic vinegar
* garlic powder
* a pat of vegan butter
* oil for grilling/sautéing

1. Heat oil in a pan (or cast iron skillet) on med-high heat

2. Lightly butter both sides of bread and sprinkle garlic powder on inside of sandwich

3. In heated pan, add seasonings such as oregano, salt and pepper and stir fry for 30 seconds.  Add sliced tomato and basil and sauté for approximately 1 or 2 minutes, until both are heated thoroughly and tomatoes have a nice, crisp edge.  Splash some balsamic vinegar and stir for additional 30 seconds.  Remove from heat.

4. Heat another pan with non-stick cooking spray and build your sandwich there.  Be careful not to touch the pans and burn yourself :P  Once sandwich is built, press down with a spatula like you're making a grilled cheese.  My favorite method is to use a cast iron skillet and place on top of the sandwich with some parchment in between.  Grill for approximately 2 minutes each side on med-high heat.  Serve!

It's so delicious and very filling.  Sometimes, if I want to treat myself, I'll spread some Daiya vegan cream cheese (chive &amp; onion flavor) or Daiya mozzarella before adding the garlic powder to give it a cheesy flavor too.

In the USA, I figure it costs me approximately approximately &lt;$1.50 each sandwich to make."

littlestray,AskReddit,1389190735.0,"Don't attempt to quit smoking until you have resolved to do so for YOURSELF. If you're only doing it to please someone else or to save money, those things won't be strong enough reasons to hold up against withdrawal reasoning: ""It doesn't cost THAT much, if I cut out something else I can make it work"", etc. Each time you attempt to quit and fail will make quitting for good harder and strengthen your excuses. Personally I used to ""justify"" smoking because I have asthma, allergies and a deviated septum...why quit to improve my breathing when my breathing sucks anyway!

I began smoking at 18 and quit May '13 after nine years of smoking. I was showering one day and thinking about how much I've begun to notice the actual physical harm I was causing myself, like having to cough up post-nasal drip in the morning and general lethargy stemming from poor breathing and, related, poor sleep. My entire family also smoked, and indoors, and even though we resolved as a group to all quit I was the only one that succeeded (and even tried, IMO).

I quit cold turkey. I had one last pack I told myself to savor and when it was gone, it was gone. I stocked up on a ton of chewy snacks to replace the physical hand-mouth habit: beef jerky, soft caramels, nuts and seeds, anything that takes awhile to chew (I'm just not a gum type of gal).

Keep track of your progress and BOAST about it. Facebook, Twitter, whatever, post the hours and days and weeks you've gone without smoking. If you cheat, DO NOT TELL ANYONE but don't forgive yourself. If you let other people know you might feel like everyone knows you've failed, and give up. So for example, if after six days you have one smoke (which will taste awful and not feel good because it's no longer so deep in your system; it's actually a pretty good reminding deterrent), keep that six day count but mark something down privately so you don't cheat often enough to simply be underground smoking. Pat yourself on the back, a lot. Rely on other crutches. For me I had a strong association between drinking coffee and having a cigarette, but even though the coffee was a bit of a trigger it was enjoyable enough on its own, too.

Try to avoid other smokers. If someone else lights up, excuse yourself from their presence until they're done. The smell will really make you sick and make you want to light up, too. Feel free to take this time to get a new, better habit. Anything hands on is great, rubik's cubes for the hands, knitting, cooking, gardening, woodcrafting, drawing. Whatever occupies your hands.

Pardon the rambling nature of the post, but I think that about wraps up what advice I've got from my own experience thus far. Oh, and have pain killers handy for the withdrawal aches. Good luck!"

What the darn-diddily-doodily did you just say about me, you little witcharooney? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class at Springfield Bible College, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret mission trips in Capital City, and I have over 300 confirmed baptisms. I am trained in the Old Testament and I’m the top converter in the entire church mission group. You are nothing to me but just another heathen. I will cast your sins out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in Heaven, mark my diddily-iddilly words. You think you can get away with saying that blasphemy to me over the Internet? Think again, friendarino. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of evangelists across Springfield and your IP is being traced by God right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggorino. The storm that wipes out the diddily little thing you call your life of sin. You’re going to Church, kiddily-widdily. Jesus can be anywhere, anytime, and he can turn you to the Gospel in over infinity ways, and that’s just with his bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in preaching to nonbelievers, but I have access to the entire dang- diddily Bible collection of the Springfield Bible College and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your sins away off the face of the continent, you diddily-doo satan-worshipper. If only you could have known what holy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you from the Heavens, maybe you would have held your darn-diddily-fundgearoo tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re clean of all your sins, you widdillo-skiddily neighborino. I will sing hymns of praise all over you and you will drown in the love of Christ. You’re farn-foodily- flank-fiddily reborn, kiddo-diddily."

It's a tough call with Cliff Robinson. I'm not a basketball fan so there's no way I would recognize his face, but it's a relatively famous name and I'm sure that any self-respecting basketball fan would recognize him right away.

TheCat5001,askscience,1389191593.0,"The short answer is: he is correct.

But I think your confusion arises from the idea that stars are the only objects in space that give off light. To see why this isn't so, you need to look at why stars are bright in the first place.

Every piece of ordinary matter in the univserse gives off photons, as a function of its temperature. A high temperature object will give off lots of photons, many of them with high energy. A low temperature object will give off not too many photons, all low energy ones. That's called thermal radiation, or black body radiation. It's the same principle that makes an iron poker glow when you hold it in the fire, as what makes the Sun give off a nice cancer-inducing shine. And provide nearly all life on Earth its much needed energy to stay alive.

The surface of the Sun simmers at a temperature of roughly 6000 K, making it shine fairly broadly across the visible spectrum, into the infrared, and ultraviolet. And it is that temperature that makes it shine, nothing else. Many people seem to think that the nuclear fusion inside the Sun produces light, but it actually only produces heat, and therefore pressure, to keep the star from collapsing. The heat produced in the core is balanced by the heat lost in radiation, so a star will keep a fairly constant surface temperature. (I'm sure any astrophysicists will gladly chime in on this point.)

Now, if we roll back the universe to just after the big bang, the universe was dense and hot. Very hot. So hot that extremely high-energy particles (including photons) were flying around everywhere. But this dense plasma wasn't transparant for photons, they kept getting emitted and reabsorbed. So they were there, but invisible. After about 30000 years, the universe cooled down enough for atoms to form, and the thermal glow that had been bouncing around was now free to escape, and didn't interfere with matter much anymore. (Please correct me if I'm wrong about this.)

This afterglow has been continuously red-shifted over time until it plunged deep into the far infrared. We can still detect this afterglow today as the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, which is currently red-shifted to correspond to a temperature of about 2.7 K. Those are the oldest photons in existence, they have existed long before the first stars formed, and will exist long after the last stars go out."

sturdyliver,Christianity,1389191642.0,"&gt; Do you truly believe that if you were born in a country where 98% of the country is Muslim, that you'd still be a Christian? Odds are just not in your favor.

You're right: had I been born in such an environment to a non-Christian family, odds are high that I wouldn't be a Christian, either. That doesn't mean that I would be condemned to hell or that God loves me less, though. It only means that I have not received the fullness of truth that is the Christian message.

&gt; Why do some people take the Bible more literally, others a lot less literally, and where do you draw the line?

The Bible should be seen as a library, not one big book: it has a mix of poetry, eyewitness accounts, and everything in between. How can we tell which is which? Well, as a Catholic, I believe that the Church came up with the Bible, not the other way around, and as such, the Bible only has authority so far as it is accepted by the Church. Most of the literalism that we see today comes from schools of Biblical scholarship that are less than 200 years old.

&gt; Why do some people cherry pick with the Bible? Example is when Christians are against gay marriage and go with the Leviticus quote, yet ignore almost everything else in Leviticus. How important is the Old Testament to Christians?

Because it's easy to remember parts of it but hard to remember the whole thing. In the case of a lot of the Leviticus stuff, Christians often differentiate between moral law and other forms of law, arguing that the moral law still holds. The first-century Judaizer controversy led to the Church deciding in council that it was not necessary for Christians to hold to the Jewish law as written.

&gt; I know you guys might not be able to answer this one, but why do Jews still exist to this day?

A lot of Jews did convert. In fact, one of the earliest Christian controversies was whether converts to Christianity had to become Jews as well. However, Jesus made it clear that not everyone would accept his message. While he taught among the Jews, he didn't come merely for their sake, either. Jesus offers salvation to all of us, not just Jews.

&gt; What are your thoughts on the ancient religions (a lot older than Christianity, Judaism, etc) that are strikingly similar in story line to the Bible? Is it just a coincidence in your eyes?

As /u/FriendlyCommie pointed out, a lot of that is historical falsehood, especially if you're talking about Horus or Mithras. The ones that follow the account of Jesus most closely can only be traced to a time following Christianity. In terms of ancient teachings that is similar (i.e. Golden Rule variations), this is not surprising, as we believe that mankind's relationship with God is damaged but was never destroyed. As such, many of these truths should be recognizable to us even without Jesus. There's a whole subset of Catholic theology that deals with natural law, and they love to talk about that kind of stuff."

Saying ""I have a boyfriend"" too early is, I imagine, very embarrassing for them if they didn't mean anything like that, but I'm sure everyone can agree that if they're offering to buy you a drink then at least most reasonable people would see that as an advance and so deflecting it, even if it turned out to not be intended that way, would not be rude.

In short yes I think saying ""I have a boyfriend but I'll still accept the drink if you're happy to buy me one knowing that"" is perfectly acceptable; accepting it without saying that is rude."

You and three (or more) friends could have HOURS of fun playing Smash Bros., Mario Kart, Mario Party, and many more, because these games were focused on the group experience. However, PS1 catered more to the single player experience. It didn't have to really worry about having four split screens, so it was able to focus most of its power on the single player. There were plenty of two-player games on PS1 that were great (Twisted Metal, anyone?), but all-in-all, PS1 was a single gamer's system. IMHO."

GetOffMyLawn_,cfs,1389192403.0,"I think I am a little better:

- I started doing the aerobic threshold thing in January.

- I was able to start a walking program in March. I can walk up to 3 miles every other day, although usually I can only do 2.

- The summer I had gotten sick I had planned to take up kayaking as a hobby but couldn't due to being bedridden. After six years of waiting to get better  I was able to paddle my kayak on flat water for up 2 hours many times. My boyfriend is wonderful, he helps me cartop it and get it down to the water's edge, then waits for me onshore while I paddle. It's heaven. I was able to paddle into November. Looking forward to getting out early this year. 

- I did not have my usual fall collapse when the weather turned cold, nor have I collapsed now during the southward extension of the polar vortex.

- Crashes are few and far between. I only had 1 cold this year, but it was doozy, about 4 weeks to get back to normal. 

- My tolerance for caffeine has increased. I take that to mean that my heart is a little stronger now. Previously caffeine made me feel like the alien was ready to jump out of my chest.

On the other hand I have made zero progress on my messy house. It seems I can keep up with only the most basic things, like dishes, laundry, cat boxes, meanwhile entropy increases. Although it only took a week to decorate the Christmas tree this year and I actually got it done before Christmas. I wonder how long it's going to take to get it down."

After i bought a new kickass pc (after 2 years of laptop life) i bought and installed a bunch of games because i could finally play them all.

And then i stumbeld over PS2 and i stoped playing every single one for them for like over a month. I exclusively played PS2 because it was (and is) so god damn much fun. And it still is by far my most played game.

Lets be hornest, mistakes were made, but in a project like this its somehow expected. But while there were some annoyances (Especially as a EU player we also have to deal with the wonky ProSieben. fE we still dont get membership/daily deals since new year.) there were no dealbreakers. At least not for me.

And overall this game is so much fun and im looking forward to many more month of awesome and epic pixel warfare. Thanks guys for you hard work. Vanu smiles upon you."

If I steal one sweater from Target, the loss to each Target shareholder, employee and customer loses several orders of magnitude less than $0.001, the smallest legal US currency denomination.  Thus, since nobody loses anything, there is no harmed party.  Yet it is illegal.

So would you then say that shoplifting is morally acceptable?  Or music piracy, for example?  In fact, in the Napster days, many people convinced themselves that music piracy was justified, because it was victimless.

I thus assert that there is a morality that does not depend on perceived harm, which can justifiably be enforced legally."

tylerpoppe,LifeProTips,1389192494.0,"I think you are right. 

I also think, as a former server, you subconsciously train yourself to become this way because customers are finicky and much like a young child who has just been hurt and looks towards their mother on how they should react. I've seen servers react many different ways to a steak that is not medium rare but is medium, but the veterans all generally respond exactly the same way because if you react to strongly then the customer will mirror and grow their already heightened reaction. 

I dropped a full set of ribs on a woman's back once - she was wearing a silk shirt - and these ribs were smothered in BBQ sauce. She was an older lady so she thought I just bumped her and did not react immediately. Now I could have dropped next to her and started begging for forgiveness and reacting emotionally like I wanted to, but by then I had become weathered by years of serving and I knew I had to react much like a parent who's child had just scrapped his knee. I came up next to her with a calmness and almost sense like I was already handling it and she just hadn't realized it. ""Mam. Ribs fell on your shirt. I need to take it (she was wearing two) so that I can have our people clean it, or if you want you can take it to your dry cleaner of choice and we'll take care of it at no cost. And we already comped your meal today."" There was almost even a little sprinkle of humor to my voice as if it was all something to laugh at, and luckily she reacted perfectly as exactly how we needed her to react. But it could have really gone bad, just like if this server started mimicking the reaction the customers had when the cockroach had fallen on them. "

captain_craptain,Drugs,1389192584.0,"Yes.  16 year olds on the whole are pretty lacking in the basic knowledge that one should have before voting.  I would say that I would allow a 16 year old to vote IF he passed some sort of competency test showing he knows about the political system, who the candidates are, and other issues that are important to know about etc. 

Some are, but most just aren't mature enough yet to be participating in these decisions.  I would argue the same goes for people 18 and up as well, but people get upset when I suggest a competency test in order to register to vote.  I'm not suggesting anything like Jim Crow here, just a test that shows you know certain things.  Like the purpose of the three branches of government, term limits for each, a basic understanding of the constitution and Declaration of Independence and some early US history.  I think the test should also cover the major current events and stay away from testing people on hot button issues that many 1 issue voters latch onto like abortion.  

I think the big difference here before anyone calls me Jim Crow is that when Jim Crow was in effect the African American community was still segregated and their education paled in comparison to white schools.  This is no longer the case and on the whole Black students now have relatively the same opportunities and resources to get an education in our public school system.  All students across the country must pass the constitution test in 8th grade to advance to High School (Right?  Please tell me this isn't just my state...)  So since the playing field has been leveled I think that the test would not be discriminatory towards any race or religion but it would discriminate against ignorance and voters who are simply driven to the polls and told who to vote for.  This I am totally in favor of discriminating against.  After all that was the purpose of the electoral college anyways, they didn't trust the masses (even though women and Blacks weren't included at the time, who they deemed of lesser intelligence)  to make a smart decision.  The Electoral college could be abolished if the popular vote weren't so tainted with zombie voters and people whose heads are stuck so far up their ass that they don't know who is on the ballot."

madhjsp,nfl,1389192611.0,"Yeah, his bloated contract is the only reason this is an issue. His overall production has been sufficient by most NFL standards, but it doesn't come close to matching what the team is paying for. But that is nobody's fault but the team's - it was unrealistic to pay him like they expected him to push 2000 yards every season, and CJ would have been a fool to decline the offer made to him, given that RBs typically only have a few years to really earn their money. It's hard to say whether it would make more financial sense for him to agree to a pay cut or to let the Titans do what they will with him and see what he could make with a different team, but if he feels like he's not going to be used in a way that best suits his playing style, I can't say that I blame him for standing firm.  

As much as I like CJ, I'm not going to be overly bummed if we do decide to go another direction either. Financially, it is the smart decision.

But for 10 grand, you could pay a photographer to go stand in that spot all day and night for a week straight and take photos.

You could get hundreds of copies of the same photo for MUCH less money. Is this just to be patron of the arts or something?

To the person talking about photo editing: All they did was edit out the people and the animals. Any first year college/high school level photographer could *easily* do this in photoshop.

littlestray,AskReddit,1389192742.0,"If it's the test I'm thinking about (the one adapted from human babies where a stranger is subbed in for the mother who leaves the room when the baby isn't looking), I feel like it's set up to display DEPENDENCY, not love or affection. Dogs DEPEND on their owners because they are completely domesticated animals. If you present a dog and a wolf with a puzzle, the wolf will relentlessly try to solve it while the dog will give it a go and then look at a human as if to say, ""tell me how to do this, we can figure it out together"". The wolf doesn't need the human, the dog does.

Cats are half domestic, we never bred them for a ""job"" or for tameness or non-aggression. Cats sort of chose to live with humans who initially allowed them to in return for vermin control and it became a sort of symbiotic relationship. The human interaction a cat gets during the first 8 weeks of life determine whether they'll be feral or domestic, and if ""tamed"" later a feral cat will be more aloof than a socialized one.

TL;DR: cats are independent, they don't rely on humans in order to survive as dogs do. The fact that they choose to hang out with us anyway I think speaks volumes, don't you?"

The first Aldmeri Dominion was formed a long time ago before Talos came to existence, the Thalmor were an group that aimed to bring mer together and their intentions appear to be less evil than the present Thalmor that we see in Skyrim. The Bosmer joined the first Aldmeri Dominion, it's not clear if the Bosmer joined the Dominion out of force or if they looked up to the Thalmor since at the time the Thalmor were playing politics in Valenwood (favoring certain Bosmer of power). 

It's also hinted that Elsweyr might have also been part of the first Aldmeri Dominion (not taking TESO in account), if they did join the. They joined willingly.

The first Dominion was later destroyed by Tiber Septim.

Now the second and present Aldmeri Dominion was formed when the Thalmor came out of the shadows and started playing politics in The Summerset Isles, later the Dominion overthrew the government all together and then went to force Valenwood to join. The Khajiit have a deep respect for the Thalmor and so Elsweyr joined the Dominion willingly.

SetupGuy,relationships,1389192798.0,"&gt; it turns out my ex-husband (36M) isn't a complete monster around our kid (11F)

Honestly, I doubt he ever was to begin with, considering how certain events occur from your point of view:

&gt; I treated him like shit and called him terrible things for putting up with me. I lied to him. I stole from him. I cheated on him. I threatened to tell the cops he was an abuser and a kiddie-fucker. I got him fired. I hit him and kicked him out three months after we signed a lease together, and then I manipulated him into buying me plane tickets to visit my family, changed the locks so he couldn't get in, and kept on stealing from him until he changed his passwords.

No one, male or female, would ever ever ever be defended for these actions. This has nothing to do with you being female, and everything to do with you treating someone in an absolutely deplorable, indefensible way. So please don't ever try to say ""omg you're just hating on me because I'm a woman!""

Then you try to apologize, and he tells you- calmly at this point, it seems like- to leave him the fuck alone. Then you badger him, and he walks away. Then you stop and grab him- you *stop* and *grab* the person you ABUSED and threatened to turn in as a child molestor- and he yells at you amidst the loud NYE party, loud enough for other people to take notice (because it's not too wild to think that you might throw a shitfit first, and try to turn the crowd on him- kind of like a child molestation accusation would). Then for nothing more than giving you a dirty look, you throw a drink at him! And he grumbles, one can only imagine how much frustration he must have felt after putting up with your shit for so long, handling this altercation as best he could, and having an alcohol drenched shirt to show for it, and what do you do? You summarize it on the internet and describe him as a wild animal.. when it was YOU throwing drinks in his face, and grabbing him, and trying to force him to listen.

And to what end? So YOU could feel better about YOURSELF for treating him like shit. You know damn well your apologies aren't going to heal him much, but it would sure do a lot for your own psyche. 

To top it off, listen to how apologetic you are:

&gt; I want to punch out all of his stupid fucking teeth and **find out where he works so I can get him fired from there** **TOO**. [emphasis mine]

--------------------------------------------

Leave him alone, never ever talk to him again. Work on yourself, and on your substance abuse. If I were your ex-husband and I read this, there's no fucking way I'd let an impressionable 11 year old grow up in the same house as the monster you described yourself as above. No fucking way.

Where I am coming from: One of the things that keeps the Patriots consistently winning double digit games is that Tom Brady embraces being coached as hard as anyone on the roster which makes it clear everyone is accountable and held to a high standard.  

There is more than one style of coaching that works in the NFL, but the Lions are in a situation where the talent on the roster seems pretty competetive, but the results are continuously underwhelming.  From my view, it sure looks like what they need is a little more *""everyone on the roster needs to be challenged""* than *""gee i hope we can find a coach that gets along with out slightly above average QB, because we probably more committed to that QB than we will be to our next coach.""*

As an aside, Sony is currently doing exactly what you describe if you own a Vita and a PS4 because in that case you are just playing the copy of the game you bought remotely.

From a business perspective, [Sony paid $340 million dollars for Gaikai](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/07/what-sonys-gaikai-purchase-means-to-playstations-cloud-gaming-future/) and I imagine there are significant infrastructure costs associated with operating the Gaikai servers/functionality.

How many of these whining motherfuckers hear opportunity knock and ignore it because they don't feel they're ready?

How many of them hear it knock and ignore it because they're scared?

How many of them ignore it because it requires more work than they're ready to put in?

How many of them ignore it because they don't feel worthy of it?

Most importantly - how many of them have been diligently preparing themselves for the point at which that knock occurs?
