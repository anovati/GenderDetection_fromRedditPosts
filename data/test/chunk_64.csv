lordfuzzywig,Warthunder,1390364916.0,"Ugh. This hurts my head.

The Data Sheet they're using for the La-5s in particular is still so far detached from reality that I don't see this patch changing any of the problems we've been experiencing. The Gaijin Data Sheet shows the La-5s overperforming orders of magintude by comparison.

The La-5 was little more than a Lagg3+, with a turn time of somewhere around 22 seconds. Still a very, very competent fighter at low altitudes -- and feared by Germans at low altitude, no less -- but far from the 5 minutes to 5000m beast it is about to be in-game. That's actually about one minute too fast, which doesn't sound like much but it's a considerable difference. Even the *late-model* La-5FNs had trouble getting to 5000m in under 5m.

The Gaijin Data Sheet (alt. history data sheet) says the max speed of the La-5 is 600kph at 6000m. That's about 20kph faster than reality. And at 5000m-570kph? It was closer to 560. There is no mention of turn-time or the way the climb rate of the La-5s PLUMMETED above 3000m and it's quite clearly not modeled in-game.

The La-5FN was the first real step in the right direction for the Russians, but even the FN could not compete with the Me109G2. It's infuriating to me to see this ""alternate history"" they're pushing for Russian aircraft in particular.

I know my outcries of evidence and published literature won't be heard on the WT forums so I won't bother, and forgive me for the rant. But there is heaps of evidence that the La-5s in game are on UFO tier and will be staying that way for the foreseeable future.

What bothers me most is that the data sheets are ""supposed to be"" accurate representations of the plane's real-life performance characteristics, but they're quite clearly just not. Using one publication as evidence for a plane's characteristics is just disingenuous. Especially when there are dozens of sites out there that cite 4+ published books that discuss the plane's performance. Hell, I can name over 10 books right now that ALL conflict with the data sheet that Gaijin is using. What a joke."

1. _changes feed:  Mongo doesn't have this.  But you can build one on top of Mongo's oplog, although it's not trivial.  See [this doc](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Oplog-Observe-Driver) for more.
2. List functions:  Nope, Mongo doesn't have this.  Nor any real analogue that I know of, although in some cases you can maybe do something clever with map/reduce.  But it's less powerful and more awkward than doing the same thing in Couch, in my experience.
3. Joins:  Yes, you can simulate them with map/reduce (eg, [as described here](http://blog.knoldus.com/2013/02/03/joins-now-possible-in-mongodb/)).

I guess what I was trying to say about joins and map/reduce is that in my personal experience, trying to do joins against a MongoDB is just too awkward and limited.  It works for simple cases, but falls apart thereafter.  Couch lacks MongoDBs query language entirely, but partly to compensate it has (in my view) much better support for map/reduce, views, list functions, show functions, etc.  But it's not that MongoDB doesn't have the core functionality, as I incorrectly implied."

MeMyselfandBi,AskReddit,1390365232.0,"But if you define your life by your lack of successes than you are painting yourself into a corner. He may be successful in your eyes and you may compare your experiences to him but if you define life as a game in which there is this ultimate ""win goal"", you're just defining life as a win/lose situation, in which you surely will lose.

What you need to understand is that everybody has limits, regardless of who they are, and to see limits as an act of losing is to define life as a game that can be lost. 

I'm not trying to say that life is wonderful and honkey dory because it sure as hell ain't but if you can latch onto things you desire (that are realistic) and pursue things that bring you happiness, then you don't have to win. Nobody has to be a billionaire to ""beat"" life. ""Happiness"" isn't even ""winning"" either. Life is a paradox of sorts, an anomaly of consciousness that wishes to perceive life from as high a point as it can but without any real finish line. 

You don't have to be happy with where you are. You just need to define life in a way in which it isn't about winning. Some people are content with the simplest of things but just because some people are doesn't mean you have to be. You can have aspirations and you don't necessarily need to achieve them. You just do what you want to do within the limitations you have at this time. You don't need to be anything to anyone if that goes against what you desire with the slice of existence given to you. If you want to do more, then start small. If you want to feel more, than do something different. If you want to achieve more, than make a small change in your life. "

It turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made, but that's the kind of person I am--turned on by Oxford commas. I find it hard to get hot for frequently misplaced ""your"" and ""you're""'s.

But at the same time, I recognize that that's just my personal preference. I've seen plenty of people hit it off when neither partner was a grammarian of any particular note, and that's great! It's easy for grammar types to look skeptically at people who aren't up on their semicolons, but hey, not everyone needs the AP stylebook to get them going.

That said, I think truly atrocious grammar is a turn-off for many simply because it's hard to understand; you want the words to flow through your partner, spiraling right to that point in their stomach or the base of their neck that makes them shiver. Hard to do that when you're unintelligible. But that said, in turn, good grammar doesn't necessarily get you laid.

In the end, I'd prefer someone with good grammar *and* an interesting turn of phrase, but I'd rather have the interesting turn of phrase than the grammar if it came to that. "

Because of this, I think it's quite a commendable achievement when women sympathise with men on the level of gender issues.

it is now possible to determine fatherhood of children easily, why does this reason still apply? 

&gt; Men also have a leadership role within the family

how does polyandry prevent men from leading their family? why must a family be lead by men?

EDIT: Forgot about the fact. Here it is:

According to popular culture, most pirates had a strict code that they adhered to with a set of rules and other things such as how the loot would be divided between the pirates. This is true, pirates did follow these ""pirate codes"" very strictly. This is an example of a surviving pirate code: 

The Captain is to have two full Shares; the Master is to have one share and a half; the Doctor, Mate, Gunner &amp; Boatswain, one Share and a quarter.
He that shall be found Guilty of taking up any unlawful Weapon on Board the Privateer, or any Prize, by us taken, so as to strike or abuse one another, in any regard, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and Majority of the Company shall think fit.
He that shall be found Guilty of Cowardice, in the Time of Engagement, shall suffer what punishment the Captain and Majority shall think fit.
If any Gold, Jewels, Silver, &amp;c. be found on Board of any Prizes, to the value of a Piece of Eight ; &amp; the Finder do not deliver it to the Quarter-Master, in the Space of 24 Hours, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and Majority shall think fit.
He that is found Guilty of Gaming, or Defrauding another to the Value of a Shilling, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and Majority of the Company shall think fit.

I've always thought there was something really beautiful about ""out of many, one"".  It is a very important part of the American culture and I don't think it's a bad one. I don't think nationalism and humanitarianism are opposite ends of the spectrum.  Obama's reelection speech mentions what you brought up, about our need to a cohesive identity because of our diverse origins:

&gt; What makes America exceptional are the bonds that hold together the most diverse nation on Earth, the belief that our destiny is shared, that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism. That’s what makes America great. 

Obama politics aside, I do think this is a very important part of our identity as a nation, and can be used for immense good. I think this is beautiful money, but I agree it's European money.

 I also have a personal preference for the old fashioned look of American money. We are such a young nation. Europe has hundreds of years of history all around them, the US does not. There is a restaurant near me that has a plaque on it saying ""Since 1989"", trying to imply it's well established. I like that money is one of the few old fashioned things we still use everyday. I understand why a designer would want a newer look. But in a country where we don't have history staring us in the face wherever we look, I like that money sort of takes up that role.

It's the same idea with Pontius Pilate, for example, as Procurator, having the authority to deal with crimes and punishments in Judea, instead of the whole Roman world depending on Caesar himself to adjudicate all disputes.

Besides, it redounds to the power of a king to discharge certain kingly duties to a minister. A professor has his Teaching Assistants grade tests, for example, and a doctor has his secretary handle appointments.

And in general, one of the features of Christianity is that God gets real people involved in the work of redemption in tangible ways. For example, God has discharged to us the responsibility of spreading the gospel and casting out demons, when he could have written it in big letters on the moon for all to see or snapped his fingers and made the world devil-free."

Professors can vary, but all of mine have been great at individual attention. Office doors are usually open. Profs go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. The legal writing professors are the most approachable and let you have mini breakdowns in their offices, or just come in to talk.

Internship opportunities are plentiful - depending on what you're looking for. I am into public interest work (hopefully public defense). Last summer I was really proactive at searching and got several internship offers. For next summer, I've had a position secured since November. Many of my friends also have part-time internships during the school year. The hard part is finding funding. There are some grants, but many students (myself included) have to take the internships for credit so that we can live off of our loans. While it sucks to pay to work, the upside is you can graduate a quarter early that way!"

We were going to be the old people in the prescription drug commercials jogging along the beach instead of the frazzled parent trying to make sure our kid doesn't miss the bus while we get ready for work.

Of course changing your diet will make you healthier (assuming you move to a healthier, balanced diet.) You'll get more vitamins, minerals, and other essentials. Whether or not you notice a difference (more energy, better sleep, higher sex drive, better muscle recovery, etc.) is debatable. But providing your body with better food will certainly help you long term, if not also short term. I'm not really sure how you could argue otherwise."
fnredditacct,changemyview,1390366037.0,"While it is true that one guy will message many, many women *(no idea how many, dozens? hundreds?)* it is still only a minority of the messages I receive. Maaaaybe 10%, 15% ? Not as many as 1 in 5. And they are less frequent than they were when I first posted a profile. At first they are relentless, quite possibly a majority, then taper off. *(at least for me)*

My play partners believe this is because I am not single, and list myself as married. I think that likely makes a huge difference. 

In fact, I know that my husband's size and strength protect me to a **large** degree. I am not, in all honesty, completely safe from harm doing what I do. But I would be **very** at risk from those I meet, if it were not for him, and more importantly, their knowledge of him and my protection under him. *(Obligatory: I really don't care if that sounds anti feminist. I am certain it is true. I don't resent his ability, as a very large strong person, to protect me, a very small person. Nor does he resent me for using my gifts to help him.)*

Something I want to emphasize again: These types of messages, oddly, don't usually solicit contact. They usually don't want to discuss anything past the sex/fetish drama they wrote. They aren't actually looking to meet up with me, or talk with me. This very well could be because I am not looking for intercourse partners, but instead kinky-act partners. Maybe if I said I just wanted to fuck, they'd hit me right back.

It's not that I expect all strangers to care about *me* fnredditacct. But I do expect that someone that contacts me to get to know me, *especially* to get intimate with me, *wants* to get to know me. 

You are probably right that people can use strangers more easily than those they know.

But I caution against the idea that knowing a person prevents someone from using them. People don't have contact with strangers nearly as much as they do people they know. If they want to use someone, strangers are not is as abundant supply.

I do believe, (based on my own small experiences, and experiences of friends and random women that like to confide in me), that it is very easy for men to rationalize using women's bodies when they can get away with it. I know more women that have been raped or assaulted than I do women who haven't confided in me that they have.

*(BIG NOTE: I don't personally generalize this to male rapists/ female victims. Women can be equally cruel, using, and dehumanizing to get what they want, though their methods are usually different. But your post is gender based, so I'm continuing that.)* 
These messages are actually, to me, more stupid than scary. But that doesn't stop them from being scary. Not because of the actually danger posed by the men messaging.

But because, every time I have to see one, I have to think again, about all the situations I know of men using women's bodies. Of how seemingly easy it is to do. Of how easily, they brush off the woman's distress. ""It wasn't that bad."" The disdain of their rationalizations. ""I know you love me."" ""I know you liked that."" ""You don't have anyone else.""

The using nature of these messages make me think again, about how easily I could be used in person. How many men would do so if they could.

I re-evaluate the men I interact with. How well do I really know them? Who am I sure I am safe with alone? Who can I name that, if I didn't have my husband, I would never be alone with again?

It is not that these messages in particular are scary.

It is that I am unable to keep from thinking about these scary implications after exposure to them."

At $50k a year, you'll pay $21,000 in taxes, but then you'll also get the $15,000 basic income. So deducting that, you actually only pay $6,000, or 12%. 

So with your other rates, you'd only be paying a grand total of 25% with the state and sales tax. 

Only people who make TONS of money actually pay anywhere near the 42% rate. Middle class would largely be looking at a cut.

That's on a single earner btw. A married couple would recieve 2 checks because 2 people, so their UBI would equal $30,000. So a HOUSEHOLD making $50,000 would pay the same $21,000, but get the $30,000 back, so they'd come ahead $9,000. And then with state and sales tax they'll pay very close to nothing in effect."

Second perhaps you should try to look at the entirety of history and perhaps a larger portion of the world because arbitrarily limiting your time and place to the time and place where the intelligensia was basically the church might skew your results. A lot of enlightenment ideas were based on ancient greek philosophy and a lot of it spread to Europe via Muslim scholars because they unlike the Christians of the time valued knowledge.

Thirdly just because some were clergymen and natural philosophers does not mean that they reconciled modern science with faith in their god. I would argue that what came out of the enlightenment was a science that was divorced from faith because it was incompatible."

My impression from looking at the websites is that they're trying to definite it as a separate category that requires action, but not necessarily as sexual harassment as defined with the law. 

I get the impression that there's ambiguity that comes in when sexual harassment in a legally actionable sense is confused with, well,  harassment which is sexual. I think this contributes to misunderstandings because, well, from the point of view of the potential harasser (i.e. a man), you're threatening to invoke criminal and civil legal sanction. Put bluntly, sexual harassment from this perspective is first and foremost something you can get into deep shit for. To me this seems excessive and paternalistic (it sort of reminds me of stop-and-frisk in NYC) , but I can't really tell if it's what the organizations in question are calling for i.e. as opposed to an awareness campaign.

The mantra of 'transition or suicide' obscures the fact that a considerable number of trans-identifying people grow out of their dysphoria, or channel their feelings into something else, or attempt/commit suicide even as they're transitioning, or after their transition, or decide to stop their transition process partway through, or transition through to the point of bottom surgery then decide to attempt to reverse just that part of it, or take testosterone before coming to the realization that they're most comfortable being butch, or have a bad experience with some part of tge transition process that makes them question the procedure in a way they might not have had things gone more the way they expected.

InfinitelyThirsting,AskWomen,1390366442.0,"The very best female athlete, in a lot of sports (not all of them, but the most physically trying) will probably never beat any of even the twenty five best men. If she did, she would be a historical and rare aberration, much like how a human being *can* get over eight feet tall, but it's exceedingly rare. The point isn't about *one* woman in six billion being able to do it, it's about how women in general would never be able to participate in professional sports. That's what a statistical fluke *is*. You can't get huffy about something that is a literal fact, just like 8'+ humans are flukes.

We're talking about *professional sports*. That's why I'm only counting the very best male athletes, because that's who the professionals are. There would be almost no women at all in professional sports if they weren't segregated.

But you seem to be in stubborn denial of both biology and statistics. No, we aren't talking about one woman representing all women--we are talking about *amongst all women, all of the very best women, none of them have ever even come close to beating men* in the most physical sports."

He wants you to hit him, not because he wants to hit you back (i.e. Courtland Finnegan) but so he can look at the ref like ""wtf this guy just hit me!"" or he can go on TV saying he was just saying ""good game"" and trying to shake his hand but the other guy responded violently. "

finalDraft_v012,asianamerican,1390366467.0,"Oh hey, that's my comment!  Like I said in the comment you linked, we had words, and he saw where he was being illogical.  I could speculate a lot on why he said that.  I could say we were drinking, which is true, I could say he gets wrapped up in emotion sometimes, which is true. I also know that he responds really well to logic, that he took a step back and realized what he said was horrible.  And it isn't what he believes inside.

When I wrote that comment, we had just talked about it and I was not confident with whether it was resolved only for that occasion or it was really resolved.  And in a way, I can only 100% say that it's a non-issue once I not only have a son but have seen them interact with each other over a few years.  But it's been a while since then and I do feel confident in saying he's not racist and wouldn't be like that if we had a son.  I've since seen him with kids as well (one of those best Asian male friends of his had a kid) and he's great with them, which also really settled my worries.  I guess you'll just have to take my word on this, because I know him better than you would.

I can't speak for the other guys who hate Asian men and love Asian women.  I do think there really are guys out there who may be taken aback by it...and perhaps this is the optimist in me, but I think most parents...both the man and the woman....don't hate their kids based on race.  At least it seems that way from the mixed children I see around here.  They have other problems with their kids, like them being unruly or messy or looking at porn at school, haha.  Then again the guys and self-hating women who look down on Asian men are not people I respect so...maybe it's good they get an Asian-looking son?  Maybe it'll change their perception?  I'm just streaming thoughts here at this point. Was just thinking, I know this guy who was a huge, shady womanizer (ex-coworker of mine).  Once he had a daughter by accident, it seemed like karma; his attitude changed and he takes a different stance on womens' issues now.  That was interesting to see.

But in reality maybe they should just not have kids :x"

The book has many interesting facts about ""the rich"".

A few that stuck out in my mind are:

* 80% of them are the first person in their family to have over $1 million in assets
* Scottish and Russian ancestry are the most wealthy ancestry groups in the United States (Jewish is 3rd)
* Most millionaires have modest houses and modest cars
* Most millionaires do skilled and unskilled labor such as carpentry, tool and die making, tree trimming, etc, except they own their own businesses

Euryleia,EQNext,1390366540.0,"&gt; yes, all MMOs technically can be 'pay 2 win'

Technically, most MMOs cannot be ""pay to win"".  ""Pay to win"" is a specific payment model, and not all games use it.

Shortcutting a character's progression doesn't make something pay to win; when level 80 characters meet in the Arena, the one who paid money instead of time to get to be level 80 has no advantage at all whatsoever.

In a pay to win game, the player who didn't pay money cannot compete with the one who did, because the one who paid received exclusive benefits that can only be got by paying.  That's what ""pay to win"" means.  It's an payment model used in some games, where paying for the game isn't meant to be optional; those games are not really ""free to play"" -- they are free to try, but you must pay to really play competitively.

Most MMOs either have a subscription or are truly free to play, and thus no matter how much money you spend, you can't gain any exclusive advantage, at best you become equal to everyone else in a shorter amount of time.  You still win or lose as much as you would have if you hadn't."

The ability of the La aircraft to turn well, dive well, and climb well at all altitudes is the *single* contributing factor to their ability to even get hits on you in the first place.

In reality (and I've read manuals given to Russian pilots on this), they clearly acknowledged the deficiencies of the La aircraft and in no uncertain terms stated that your best bet -- your ONLY bet -- is to not try to chase at all but to capitalize on the mistakes of the enemy by staying high and staying in formation with top cover at all times. If Las were dived on, they were supposed to immediately go for the ground (where they would outperfom 109s). They were so greatly outperformed at 3km. If that was modeled, they wouldn't be able to get hits on your pilot except with snap-shots just like every other plane.

With all that knowledge, compare that to how the La-5s perform in-game. It's no wonder the ShVAKs are pilot headshot machines. Even .50cal MGs could be that way if the planes performed like the Las do."

Essentially, she started in with her normal verbal, emotional and psychological bull. 

My foster mother not only stated that as I was in their care, they got to say what I deserved or didn't deserve but she said that she wasn't going to sit there and allow her to treat me like garbage because I deserved better than that. 

After years of feeling so worthless, so unloved and so hated, this woman, who hadn't known me long not only was treating me like a human but actually proving how much she cared about me. 

That was the start. I did have some back slips, there were certain habits that were hard for me to fully give up. But the turn around happened because of the support of my foster parents.

Have you ever been in fear for your life in a back alley or a dark street? Like, actually, positive that you would not be physically strong enough to fight off someone if you were to be attacked? Have you ever wondered how loud you'd be able to scream if you needed help? 
 
Now, imagine you need to be on your guard like that at all times. From the second you walk out the door, you're judged on your looks first. Your fuckability measures your self worth and if you do meet men's standards, they can't WAIT to tell you about how hard they want to ram you. How they want to ""destroy"" you. You become reduced to orifices and lumps of fat that sit on your chest and hips. SHOW ME YOUR TITS, BITCH you hear yelled from a car as soon as you step out of your apartment in a sensible sweater. On your subway commute, a man twice your size gropes your ass and growls ""choke on my cock"" into your ear before running off at the next stop. Work is uneventful. Your boss stands way too close when he talks, as usual. You're not sure if he's trying to push physical boundaries or if that's just how he talks, but you're wary after the morning you've had. You decline drinks with a coworker because last month when you went out, a cab driver grabbed your neck and tried to lock you in but you kicked your way out. You try to make it home before 10 now. You get home and jump online to check your okcupid account. You've got 25 messages. 20% of them are from men 15+ years or older than your age limit. 25% dick pics. 40% start off with a negging attempt or demanding nudes. 5% rape threats/rape ""erotica"". 5% normal sounding guys. 

Would you still assume these men are stupid?"

WeaklyDominant,TrueReddit,1390366816.0,"Your post raises some interesting points. Here's what I think:

Yes, I agree it is potentially valid to dislike Richard Sherman on non-racial terms. I think the issue is that *isn't* what's happening with lots of people. A lot of their comments aren't as race-neutral as you might think e.g. ""ugh athletes have no class"" just seems to smack a different way in this situation. And don't even get me started about all the tweets about him, plenty of which are just clearly vitriolic.

I don't think the point about Ali is about whether he's a good racial figure so much as whether his persona was calculated as a psychological tactic, and whether it's effective. That's part of the broader point about Sherman--yes, being so 'self-promotional' might come off as douchey, but if it rattles his opponents and seems to have an effect on them, then maybe it's worth it. And maybe critics should be less hard on him."

He was always well rested and I think as long as he was getting enough sleep the times didn't really matter much.

 Eventually we had to adjust for school and we did slowly over a month. Now he is an early riser and has never had an issue with his 6:30am wake up for Kindergarten.

 But think about it. Your a dad. And you hear a voice in your daughters room. You knock and your daughter says ""Dont come in we are naked"". You already think its a boy. What would your response be? 

If you dont act like this then you do not care about your daughter getting fucked in your house. And that is fine. But my fear about my daughter getting fucked is more about pre mature pregnancy, like all fathers, than anything else. And my immediate response can cut into premature relationships. I personally got laid at 16 and I regret it. Others might be different but I believe its too young. For numerous reasons. But I would act the same way. 

Edit: dont know why Im downvoted. Its only by anyone who has never been a father or ever seriously thought about being a father. The fear of their daughter getting fucked comes from their own fear. They know the kind of scumbags they can be at a young age and dont want their daughters with men that are the same way, and subsequently think the same way they did in the past. Which is scummy. Thats also why they mellow out over time. Because they recognise men mellow out over time and arent the sex monkeys they used to be in high school. Allowing for deeper relationships. 

Tldr: men are douchebags in high school. And I would beat my daughters bf's ass in hs. Men mature after HS and can handle things better. But fuck HS boys. "

7thDRXN,asktransgender,1390367151.0,"It can help just to write things out.  Oh, which totally reminds me of something else that has helped me in the past.  Writing things out.

When thoughts are in your head, they circle and loop in so many interconnected ways it's hard to tease out any realizations/solutions/connections, because it's so convoluted.  Writing is by nature a very linear activity, so sometimes things that have circled around for awhile can come out in writing as some very profound A-&gt;B links that are easier to ponder.

So maybe before you go to bed, rather than just sit with these thoughts endlessly circling, just write a few pages of diary material, and hopefully that will loosen the charge these have and give you an outlet of some kind.  A great exercise in The Artist's Way series, which really could help everyone, I think, is ""morning pages"" - where you keep paper by your bed and as soon as you wake up, turn off the alarm, just immediately grab that and start writing.  It's something like your right, rational brain hasn't fully kicked in yet and sometimes profound realizations can leak through this stream of consciousness as you write.  A lot of times I don't even remember writing what I wrote and looked at later.

Anyhow.  I hope you find something to ease the pressure. &lt;3"

Plus, I also think that because I *knew* what was happening was wrong, that gave me an edge. Many people never get a chance to even realize that. I had a handful of good years, and years of therapy that taught me what was ""right"" and what was ""wrong"". 

And finally, I think it can be credited to who I am: my personality, will and strength of character. 

I didn't *want* to be a victim anymore. And I realized that if I didn't pull myself out of where I was, I was going to remain a victim. 

As to why I never turned to suicide. That was spite. My adoptive mother loved to tell me that I should just kill myself because I wasn't worth anything and other such nonsense. I seriously considered it when I was about 14, after some long thought on it I realized that if I did in fact kill myself she would win. I couldn't let her win, even though I was miserable and I hate my life and I thought I would never get out--I couldn't kill myself because that would make her happy. "

But this post defined the genders, and i was working within that definition.

It is not that I think these men ""would rape me if the law wasn't there to stop them.""

As far as the dating website, I'm using fetlife, not okcupid, just for clarity, although I'm not sure it matters at all. And the messages I'm referring to actually aren't looking to meet up with me. They just lay out a sexual/kinky drama. They say things they *would do* or that I *could do* but don't look for contact with me. (that is, don't ask questions about me, or offer information about themselves, or even offer to meet up for sex. just tell the little drama they unfold.)

I do not think that all men are this way. Or even that all people are this way.

I do not generalize this to masculinity. 

What I am trying to say, is that by reading these things, and feeling the way they use me, it necessarily forces me to think about being used.

And that feels uncomfortable, and unsettling. And then I think about how easily I could be used.

Not because I think all men will, or would want to, or even would if they could.

But because it has just happened, even though just a little. Even though through the internet.

I don't mind so much 'being used non consensually to get off."" I understand that the profile I wrote is public and be used by anyone who comes across it to create whatever fantasy they want.  I don't really mind that. It is when I am *contacted* in a way that *does not want contact from me*, that is the upsetting part.

If every message was, ""hey, I'd like to fuck you. Let me know if you're interested.""  That'd be fine. I (probably) wouldn't be interested, but those messages are not what I'm talking about at all.

The ones I mean are more like, *(I'm going to un-kinky this so as not to possibly offend people),* ""I'd take your clothes off, lick you from toes to ass, tongue your ass, pinch your nipples, ...."" and so on, sometimes short. Sometimes long. But don't even end in a ""if you like the sound of that, let me know."" Just...the drama.

I am just trying to explain the root of the upset over these messages.

*it occurs to me now that I could be talking about a completely different kind of message than OP meant....*

It could potentially teach the child wrong ideas about sexual boundaries and appropriateness. All kids are sexually curious, but there is a time and place, and more appropriate partners to engage with. Your family members not being in that group.

It also creates a bad situation for the child should they ever want to stop. There is an uneven power dynamic, and if they want to stop but feel bad because the mother enjoys it, then it could lead to a very confusing and damaging situation for the child.

This can carry into their adult sex life, where they might have problems establishing healthy boundaries and power dynamics, sacrificing their own comfort and needs for the sake of their partners. Or in a more extreme case, believing they exist only to fulfill another partner's sexual needs.

-First start eating clean.  Don't have crappy food in the house.  Fill your fridge with stuff like chicken breast, beans, broccoli, almonds, fish, etc.  If it doesn't require preparation, it probably isn't ""clean eating"".

-Eat as much as you feel like, but not all at once.  Make a small plate, eat it, and then no food for an hour.  If you are hungry then, have another small plate.

-However much you exercise, do just a little more.  If you don't exercise, start with just 20 minutes of walking or jogging a day, whatever you are comfortable with.

-Once you have a routine down and the empty calorie cravings (sweets, white carbs, beverages with calories) have gone away, then you can start counting calories if you like.

-Have a cheat day every week or two, but only if you have stuck to your strategy.  Keep a log of any and all cravings you have, and work them all in at once.

Stick with it.  Nothing tastes as good as being fit and sexy feels.

gualdhar,technology,1390367470.0,"This is exactly the same argument the Luddites were making in the Industrial Revolution. Mechanized looms and such were faster and required less skilled workers, displacing relatively higher paid artisans in the same field. It was a major shake up at the time, leading to higher unemployment especially in the former middle class. But eventually things settle down, and new fields opened up to offset the loss of jobs.

Personally I don't think 20 years is enough time to completely remove the face-to-face interaction people look for at retail positions, so the guy that makes your coffee probably won't go away for a while. But the guys at the distribution warehouse that delivers all that coffee are probably going away in 10 years, if that.

I think the government is going to have to look into doing something like the Swiss were considering before. If efficiency gets so high that people can't find employment even though the economy is otherwise healthy, they're going to pay people a base salary if they can't find work. If not that, at least increase aid to people going back to college or picking up a desirable trade in the new market.

Unemployment can't stay high for long. If it did, there's wouldn't be enough money flowing through the economy to keep demand up. As rich as the top 0.1% of the country is, they don't spend a large enough percentage of their wealth to sustain the economy. They actually need the rest of us."

I started playing around 2nd edition.  I'm assuming THAC0 was something that carried over from first ed.  When we picked up 3rd ed, I was a bit surprised that THAC0 was gone, but then it occurred to me that the idea of a base attack bonus and armor class going *up* as armor got better actually made things a lot simpler to figure out while not having any discernible limitations over the THAC0 system.  

Why does AC in 1st and 2nd edition get better as it goes down?  Was there some context in which it made sense in some early game, or was it always just an odd design decision?"

On the other hand, my wife's parents are not as helpful, though they have visited a few times.  So I think it depends a lot on the grandparent.

JonWood007,Shitstatistssay,1390367694.0,"Before I begin, I'm gonna come clean and say that I'm a ""statist"" who decided to post here on SSS because I'm a basic income supporter and perhaps you guys would benefit from hearing these perspectives straight from the horse's mouth.

First of all, I'm gonna ask that by implying that people wouldn't clean toilets if they didn't ""have to"", you're basically saying if you did not hold peoples' very livelihoods over their heads they wouldn't do such degrading jobs, correct? That the only way toilets would get cleaned is if you're literally motivating to do it because their alternative is starvation, correct? Because I just wanna say, that sounds like a form of exploitation or slavery, which is what basic income is supposed to, you know, fix. To make work more voluntary, to make people less vulnerable to such exploitation.

Anyway, if it makes you feel better, there's no evidence that basic income would severely reduce the work force. I think one study done here in the US in the 70s indicated that it would only reduce working hours by only 17%, and this might be overblown because the study was done on a form of negative income tax that rewarded people more if they did not work, therefore possibly causing some people to fudge their numbers (if this is true, this would not necessarily be bad considering the unemployment rate and crap). A study done in canada with the mincome pilot program indicated only new mothers and teenagers did not work as often. other studies done in the third world actually saw an increase in productivity if anything, so the idea that people wouldn't work is kinda baseless. The amount is too small to eliminate the work incentive. It might actually increase incentive because people will no longer lose benefits due to the welfare trap being eliminated...which is why there's a 40-45% flat tax rate even on the poor...it's meant to act as a method of clawing back the benefits. Quite frankly, most people should see similar or lower effective tax rates (with a lot of people getting effectively negative ones, meaning they get more from UBI than they pay in taxes) in practice. Only the top quintile would actually see their taxes go up.

But say I'm wrong. Say people wouldn't clean toilets. Well, that just means the market would have to adapt. people would have to actually pay people a dignified wage to get people to willingly clean toilets, or, maybe the owner of the business can get out of his board room once in a while and do it himself. Would be a nice change of pace to see a CEO do the dirty work.

Or, since the original post was in r/futurology...maybe they're assuming they'll have self cleaning toilets by then or some crap...or robots that can clean toilets. Normally when basic income is brought up in the context of futurology, it's talking about a world in which a ton of jobs are eliminated and none are created to replace them, causing mass unemployment."

funkalunatic,WTF,1390367818.0,"&gt; the context was humanity in general.

Humanity *in general* doesn't need to eat meat to survive. A few living in certain climates and conditions do, but *in general*, most meating is a luxury activity undertaken by those with disposable means, living on a greater-than-subsistence lifestyle, whereas *in general*, those living hand-to-mouth in third world countries and indigenous situations don't get a lot of meat, though not for lack of want. Now if you want to talk about what the Earth can sustain, I guarantee you it isn't a burger and some bacon every day for everybody and all the land needed to support that.

Now if you want to talk about what's *natural*, that's a load of horseshit. Nothing you do is ""natural."" Your morality isn't ""natural."" If you insist on worshipping that natural, as many do, then the fact of the matter is that whale hunting is far more natural than what goes into bacon.

ruta_skadi,AskWomen,1390367945.0,"I strongly disagree. It is not possible for someone to be in love with me when they've never even talked to me. There is no comparison between ""that girl over there is really cute, I'm interested in her"" and ""I am in love with my girlfriend who I am in a deep, committed relationship with"". Calling the former ""love"" does a disservice to the latter and diminishes the meaning of the word. I mean, based on your own list, how could a stranger ""adore"" me when they haven't a clue about my personality? How can they ""trust"" me when I could be a serial killer, KKK member, or pedophile for all they know? How can they be ""devoted"" to me when we have absolutely no relationship or connection? Love is not the same thing as ""romantic interest"" and there is a reason we have two separate terms for those. Someone piquing your interest isn't love. It could lead to love someday in the future, but it isn't love. 

&gt; If I met a girl who I felt this way about, I would probably not feel comfortable talking to her or getting to know her, because I would have to do so while hiding my feelings.

Well, I'm sorry but it's not society's fault that you can't contain yourself and act appropriately and feel you need to not talk to her at all. But plenty of people do, it's extremely common to approach someone based on looks, especially in bars, clubs, etc. I mean, there's no reason you have to pretend you aren't *interested* in her. But you can do so without going so far as to say ""I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU, LET'S GET MARRIED RIGHT NOW AND BE TOGETHER FOREVER!!!"" The reason it's not appropriate to say that isn't because society's unfair and wants to punish romantics, it's because it is *totally* out of line with your level of familiarity. 

Frankly, if you are capable of just walking away without talking to her because it would uncomfortable, I think that already tells you that it's not love. I can't imagine letting a moment of discomfort keep me away from someone I was *actually* in love with.

Even you are still convinced that you go around falling in love with girls just by their looks, it's still *not* sad that it's inappropriate to tell them so. I'll reiterate that it doesn't stop you from talking to them, just make *normal* conversation and don't scare them off with grandiose declarations. And why is it sad that there is a norm that prevents people from doing things that would be uncomfortable, or even frightening, to the recipient? If a stranger says something like this to me it creeps me the fuck out and makes me very uncomfortable. Is this person gonna be obsessed with me and stalk me? Kidnap me? Worse? Are they mentally ill? If they're so bad at that boundary, what other boundaries might they violate? I don't see how it's ""sad"" that you are expected to take another person's feelings into account before you act. "

Also, you don't even need it to flow into the eyes. The goal is to hit sensitive membranes such as the upper-lip (nostrils) and around the eyes. Imagine, if you will, the subject is wearing sunglasses. You wouldn't aim for the eyes. You'd aim pretty much everywhere but the eyes. It will generally not ""flow down"" into the eyes. But the particulate will aggravate the eyes despite remaining dry. The reasons are numerous (splashing etc.), but really, your goal should not necessarily be to hit the eyes.

Lower concentrations of OC are just as much reeeeeeeeeeeeally aggravating skin irritants as they are hot/blinding. The higher concentrations actually don't aggravate the skin at all.

If you are tired and stressed, but lash out when you are tired and stressed...you're going to have a hard time getting along with an SO.  You will have to put effort in to making things work, so that your future girlfriend doesn't feel like she is always the one bending over for you.  That can be in little things.  Like, don't forget her birthday (which my ex-boyfriend who was a med school student did), or try to plan for special occasions like that.  This all depends also on having a girlfriend who understands you will be stressed, and she will have to have her own life, hobbies, and friends to fall back on for when she can't be with you...that way she doesn't feel so lonely.

Personally, I don't think I would date another doctor/med student.  While long distance was actually good for us...he *was* the type who would lash out.  And I thought that was weird because his career will only bring him more stress, so he needed to deal with his bad emotions.  I'd also worry a lot about nurses and other women throwing themselves at him.  I'm sure your future girlfriend/wife would appreciate reassurance that won't happen (unless it does..?)!"

Orelle,infj,1390368168.0,"Being chameleonic, plus wonkiness under stress, is why I began exploring MBTI. It's helped me embrace the weaknesses and quirks of my personality, but also be assertive when I see something that isn't me (i.e. the Socionics ""romance style"" link here last week). 

I think it's good to be uncomfortable sometimes, especially when you're trying something for the first time, but it can also be a good indicator of when you're not being true to your true self. When you feel discomfort and dislike, with little payoff. Like when people try to pull you into gossiping. People seldom try that around me anymore. 

I don't have advice so much as I have questions. What if, instead of worrying about being distinct, you try to act authentically? If you're someone who has a different relationship with everyone, who makes people comfortable as they are — albeit flexible, isn't that 'identity' an OK place to start? And what might have happened if you *had* opened up last weekend? 

Sometimes you're at a party, and there's music on but no one's dancing. If you bravely take the floor, chances are you won't be alone for long. 

Be fearlessly untimid. You can catch others' moods, but you can give them yours, too. There are times to be influenced, and times to be influential.

As far as moving the cursor around in text: you should see a little arrow when you place your cursor inside the text. You can click and drag this icon.

At this point in my life and relationship, I have no reason to think that my marriage won't last a lifetime either, but, I know that there are things in life that are completely out of my control and therefore it is possible my marriage could end at some point even if I don't not want it to. It is no different to anything else in life."

chowler,WritingPrompts,1390368516.0,"Morning. About 7:30 or so. Mel was standing by the vanity getting ready for work. You still remember the night you met her almost a decade ago at some Columbia bar in the Upper West Side on New Years Eve during your Sophomore year at Hunter. She came with a classmate but left in your taxi. You'd never say it to her, but she is the the only thing keeping you in this gloomy claustrophobic grey lined concrete city called New York. Been 13 years together and married for 7 of them and you'd relive them all over again. Even with law school and all those long nights away from her spent with books and case studies at NYU and those long walks down Washington Square at night wondering if all this was worth it, it was morning like this, spending those 40 or so minutes with her only made every sacrifice worth it.

You've grown fond of the sound of the comb scratching through her wild brown hair. She smelled like mandarin and honey. The sun shone through her shirt and revealed every inch of her body that she hides and you crave. Her hair draped down to her mid back. Threads of browns, reds, and golds cascading all around her.

Her hair always looked like this every morning and even when coming out of water, just like when you two spent those 8 unforgettable days in waters of Bali after you finally proposed to her against all those arguments about commitment and if ""you really want all this"". 

You had to wait though. Law school demanded to much time and attention, you couldn't commit to her even though your desires and wants called you to, goals needed to be reached. Graduation, landing a job at Stark &amp; Stark Law Firm, starting your own firm, setting your future right. It was three long years of hating yourself almost as much you loved her. Everything about her. The freckled right cheek and smooth left. How she furrows her eyebrows when she tries to watch hockey. Her love for the Jets and that ratty old Namath jersey of hers even though you can't stand the team. When her leg begins shaking if shes late while on the train or bus. The chipped tooth she never got around to fixing. The scar over her eye you gave her when you dropped her while spinning her around like the final scene of *Dirty Dancing*. Everything. Even the way her fingers dance and twirl when she spins a forkful of pasta. 

You finally asked her to spend the rest of your lives together when the Ball dropped bringing in 2007. The smile, the silent scream, the dancing, the whole moment stills feels tactile, still feels real even against all these years. You told her as you dropped to one knee ""Six years ago I met the woman who I can't live without. Does she has feel the same?""

She is everything you bled for and everything and anything you could have imagined in the woman you love.

She turned around while combing her hair and screamed. The brush fell to the ground and shattered into pieces and a splash of water. Her face twisted into this mask you've never seen. 

""Doctor!"" *I'm a lawyer, what doctor?*

A man in scrubs came rushing into your bed room with a look of utter amazement.

""Where's Mel?"" you demand.

""Oh my God. He's finally awake,"" he ignored you, or didn't hear you. Did you call for her? Your mind thought the sound but did your mouth create it? The light from the windows morphed into florescent lights hanging over head. Mel always hated them. 

""What should I do?"" *Mel*

""Get Dr. Holt, ASAP,"" *Mel! Where's Mel!* Beige wallpaper and sandy carpet melts into glass windows and blue tile.

""Mr. Williams, can you hear me?"" the man asked. You nod. ""Good, good. I'm so happy for you to make it out of this nightmare."" *Nightmare? What happened to me? To Mel? To everything?*

""Mel?"" you croak out. The man turns his eyes to meet yours. He looks at his nurse and gives her a nod. She runs out of the room and closes the door behind her.

""Mr. Williams. I don't know how to tell you this, but you have been in a coma,""

""What? How?""

""A car accident. Drunk driver.""

""Where's Melanie? My wife!"" His eyes danced away from yours.

""I'm very sorry Mr. Williams, but this will not be easy. She died in the accident that night.""

""When? What night?""

""New Years Eve, sir.""

*The proposal* you thought out loud.

""Excuse me, Mr. Williams?""

""I proposed to her that night years ago in '07,"" you solemnly told him. 

""Again, I'm very sorry to do this, but what year is it?""

""2014"" you said without missing a beat.

""It's 2003. You've been in a coma for two years,""

Then it hit you. The past 13 years vanish from you into nothing. NYU, the all nighters,  Hunter, Mel, Columbia, the hair, honey, brown threads of hair, Mel, meeting her parents, starting the firm, finding out your a father, Mel. All gone. 

*Everything. I've lost Everything.*"

sockalicious,personalfinance,1390368537.0,"1)  Do you make it to work on time every day?  If so, ask for a raise.  Don't say why.  Worst that can happen is they say no.

2)  Turn your 401(k) contribution down to the minimum needed to get the full match.  I am tempted to tell you to turn it down to 0 until the CC bills are paid off, but that's really robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Still, it might be worth considering.  People will holler about 100% returns that you're missing but the fact is, you are stuck right now and no amount of matching of 401(k) money helps you get unstuck.  

3)  Call the place that has the medical bill on tap and see if they'll give you a discount.  A 30% discount for immediate over the phone payment is standard.  You may even qualify for a hardship write-off - I'd give you one.  Can't hurt to ask.

4)  Don't ignore the IRS; screw up your courage, call them, and let them know that you are aware of your debt but can't pay the full amount because you don't have it.  They often will help you by writing off some of the debt and setting up a payment plan for the rest.

5) Remember that creditors can't get at your retirement assets, no matter what, so don't volunteer to use them to pay any debt.  Just don't even think about doing that.

6)  Abandon the idea of buying a house.  No way you'll get a mortgage with a tax lien and maxed out CC's.  Even after that, getting a mortgage is costly in terms of fees - inspection, title search, termite inspection, foundation check, credit check, loan origination fees, who knows what else.  Utilities are costly - all of them: gas, electric, water, sewer, Internet, garbage.  (phone? cable?)  Home maintenance and repairs are costly and a lot of things - busted toilet, busted pipe, busted water heater - can't be put off.  Fire insurance is costly.  Flood insurance is costly.  Landscaping and tree surgery is costly but sometimes those things are actually necessary expenses that can't be deferred.  PMI, which you would certainly have to have, is costly and not included in most handy online loan calculators.  Property tax ain't cheap.  If you really want to move, find a cheaper apartment.

You don't need to jump off a bridge.  You're in the soup but you will be able to make your way out of it eventually."

- how much space each plan offers

- how many computers

- how much per additional computer

- if there's support for backing up NAS drives, because many backup companies exclude those.


Yes, I found what I was looking for, but my first instinct was NOT to click on ""how it works"" to find that.  Furthermore, there doesn't seem to be mention of space on that page. is it unlimited like the business plan is? [link for reference](http://www.backblaze.com/internet-backup.html).

then I click ""for business"" to compare -- i can't compare... business is $50/machine instead of $50 base + $5/machine... okay, but what more do I get over the personal plan?

From the moment I got into hockey though it was all LA. I don't really know why, but since I first played an NHL video game I played as the Kings and have never looked back.

As for baseball, I went with Minnesota when my mate got into baseball because before then I'd never had much MLB exposure and supporting the same team sounded fun. But the Dodgers have always been my NL team because they played on ESPN the most, and I developed a connection with them."

I'm not clear on whether it had ever been done to me in order to try and gain *more* attention from me.  But perhaps my reactions are not ideal to getting guys of that nature to keep talking to me, so it's self-selection in that sense?

If I'm the one showing a lot of attention and he responds scarcely: I think he is not interested in talking to me, I feel like I am bothering him and I stop. I have other people I can jabber to.

I like constant attention. I feel closer to people who put an effort in reaching out to me, because sometimes I feel like I'm the one always reaching out to others..and that gets tiring.  It offers more chances for us to get to know each others' personalities better, to see whether we can let the conversation ""flow"" better than with other people I know.

It's easy to say that we should just feed them in separate rooms, but when you feed them as part of a morning routine, if they haven't finished their food before we leave, we can't keep them cooped up in a room all day.  It's also difficult to make them eat less because overweight kitties are more at risk for feline anorexia.  Both of my big babies stopped being interested in food all the sudden and I thought it was a good thing.

I really don't like HTC Sense at all, so it's nice to be able to not have to deal with it. I flashed OneDroid, which is CM11. My phone is fast and all around awesome. I can do cool things now, like turning on my flashlight by merely holding down the lock button on my lockscreen. One of the biggest things for me was being able to block ads from anywhere on my device, whether it be on my browser, or in Youtube.

There's a lot of random little tweaks that I use, but I can't name them off of the top of my head to be honest. I rooted my phone pretty much instantly after getting it, because I hated Sense so much.

kempff,Catholicism,1390369396.0,"Fasting is justified in the Bible. How the Coptic Orthodox form their own policy for their faithful is their business, but in principle the Bible is all about fasting - and the document you referenced already lists most of the verses I have in mind.

Is switching to Coptic Catholic an option? I mean I don't know if they have the same fasting rules or not, but you would be coming out of schism so you'd have that going for you which is nice.

But you always have a right to say. I mean look at the Kings of Judah and Israel - they went back and forth generation after generation adopting and abandoning Judaism or some other religion more often that Liberace changing costumes in concert. But then again consider Naomi, Naaman, the Bereans, the Ethiopian Eunuch, and the minority believers in Athens - they all came from cultures and religions where converting would have been an exciting fulfillment of hope or an awkward and delicate affair depending on the circumstances, and in each case there was a unique settlement that satisfied the consciences of each one. So, think about it and do what you know you can live with.

Now as for purgatory, I'm just going to unload some sources on you and let you take it from there.

* Baltimore Catechism: https://archive.org/stream/baltimorecatechi14554gut/14554.txt (sorry, it's the full text file on one page, but you can use your browser to search for the keyword ""purgatory"", and the major reference is at the end, in Lesson 37, starting with Question 414.

**Approx Cost:** $800

**Sample List:** [Mine](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/sneak-and-breach-25-10-13-1/), no one said they had to be tournaments...

**Pros:** Cheap in comparison to other decks in Legacy.  Resembles a better deck (Sneak and Show) that it can eventually be converted into.  Teaches you the weaknesses of the threats that are run therein.  Contains staples such as Emrakul, Griselbrand, Chalice of the Void and City of Traitors.  Very linear and simple.

**Cons:** Not a top tier deck.  Particularly weak to Force of Will (before  board).  Very draw dependent and without the cantrips and filtering that blue has.

**Description:** This deck is a slightly faster, much more fragile version of the combo that Sneak and Show runs.  It ramps up it's mana and then pushes out a fatty to beat it's opponent's face.  While this is easily disrupted, the deck also runs counter disruption like Chalice of the Void, showing the new player that counterspells aren't the only way to win in Legacy.

Chrys7,asoiaf,1390369550.0,"I don't think Varys was the one who started the War of the Five Kings at all, I think he wanted to wait for a while longer.

Littlefinger on the other hand is pretty much the binding root of all the trouble. He assassinates Jon Arryn (via Lysa) and given the chance betrays Ned Stark as well.

Now here's the thing, Littlefinger knows that Tywin is a capable commander capable of fighting both the North and the Riverlands for a while (especially since both he and Tywin didn't think Robb Stark would be a good commander). He also knows Renly's ambitions as well as Stannis's general personality, he knows those two won't cooperate with each other ever and he also knows that Lysa won't move a finger since she's pretty much his puppet.

Varys isn't required to kick off the War of the Five Kings, he might've just made adjustments to his plans because of the circumstances.

As far as Tywin goes, the Baratheon brothers weren't even expected to come into play since neither of them is particularly attached to the Starks or the Tullys so they probably never even came across his mind until they actually came into the war.

As far as taking arms against the North and the Riverlands (with the possibility of the Vale supporting them), I think Tywin is arrogant enough to think he can outwit Robb Stark, Lysa Arryn, a very sick Hoster Tully and his Son. 

Overall the Westerlands can match the force of those three kingdoms as far as I'm aware since he sends Jaime to Riverrun with a sizable host (25 thousand if I recall) whereas he takes the other half of his forces to the Green Fork and we know from later events that they're still capable of raising a third whereas the North mustered around 20 thousand men and the Riverlands could maybe join up with 15 thousand more, we don't know how many the Vale could've provided but in all likelihood they would have enough to match them 1:1 in manpower but from Tywin's point of view he has better commanders and doesn't have to overextend his armies whereas the North does.

Do keep in mind that it isn't clear that the Baratheon brothers will rebel since Tywin doesn't know that Joffrey is illegitimate and he doesn't know that Stannis knows either. He also probably didn't predict that Renly would make a move regardless backed by the Tyrells and by the time that happened he was already in a position that he couldn't easily back away from."

Specifically, the act of laughing releases endorphins in the brain, a specific type of chemical that causes the ""feel-good effect.""

So why does laughing often beget more laughing? To some extent, it depends on the social context. Laughing in the presence of others can make you more at ease around them, and it builds a certain type of social hum/ambiance within the group that lends itself to more laughter. The article uses the example of a dinner party with different-language speakers where somebody says something hilarious-sounding but incomprehensible, and it kind of builds off itself because of the comfort/feedback loop, rather than because of objective humor of what is said.

In terms of laughter being contagious when other people are laughing, [this other article](http://www.livescience.com/9430-study-laughter-contagious.html) writes about how people's muscles prep to laugh when you simply observe other people laughing. This is related to [mirror neuron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron) phenomena, in which humans essentially respond to observed stimuli as if they were the ones directly experiencing the stimulus (e.g. they simulate what it's like to have it actually happen to them). Through this process, you're more inclined to laugh when you see somebody else laughing, and that's part of how the feedback loop grows."

MIL kept on giving us bullshit advice (give tea to a 3 month old who is nursing) and pushing us to get vaccinations outside of the schedule that the doctor was recommending.

Sure enough we came home one day and found that she'd gone against our specific wishes and administered a vaccination that our doctor had been planning for months later.  Luckily nothing bad came of it but the trust had been broken and we never let her baby sit again.  "

gyrorobo,gaming,1390369795.0,"If you want a full list that you'll probably get confused by, [here is the full list](http://serenesforest.net/fe13/skills.html)

Your beginner classes get the first skill at level 1 and second skill at level 10. At level 10 you can choose to ""prestige"" into the advanced version of the class or an advanced version of a similar class. (mage can turn into Dark mage, but mage can also turn into sorcerer if you want those abilities instead). When you ""prestige"" into this second tier of classes, you get your next ability at level 5 and the final ability at level 15. The nice thing is that once you have an ability, you can switch to a different similar class and still keep all your old skills.

As far as actual abilities, a lot of them are procs based on your stats as a character. For example the ability ""Lethality"" lets you instantly kill anybody if it triggers... that includes bosses. The percentage of proc is you skill level divided by 4. So say you have 60 skill (which is insanely high.. but it is possible) you have a 15% to instantly kill the person you're fighting.

There's also A LOT of buffs and resistance skills that I don't usually use. There are skills that grant your character another move if they kill someone (Galeforce). Which is a very powerful skill (in campaign) that you should always pass to the child if you can. (Counter) is another pretty good one that deals the same amount of damage you take back to the giver as long as the attack isn't powerful enough to kill you.

Here are a few quick copy and pasted popular ones

Pavise - Halves damage from swords, lances, axes (includes magical variants) and beaststones (triggers based on skill %)

Luna - Your attack ignores half the enemy's Defence or Resistance (based on skill %)

Vantage - When HP under half, always attack first during the enemy's Turn

Sol - Recover HP equal to half the damage dealt to the enemy (based on skill %)

There isn't really any gear besides weapons, and if you become really proficient in swords then switch to a class that can't use them, you are shit outta luck.

It's a pretty damn good game, and if you have a 3DS I would definitely recommend it because it's one of the better games on the system."

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1390369805.0,"Age does matter to me.  There may be future exceptions, but I guess it's sorta like a standardized test score...it's an easy way to weed out people I probably won't have anything in common with.  I don't want to date anyone who is more than 2 years younger than myself.  Aside from the fact that they'd be just getting out of college and may not understand what it's like to pay bills and have responsibilities (I'm 26), I've tried talking with people younger than me before...and it's rare for us to get along.  It turns out I make a lot of pop culture references that are interwoven with my generation; certain cartoons and certain video games that are dear to me will go over their  head.  I can usually still find other things to talk about, but I'd rather be with someone whom I can talk to freely about those interests.

As for someone older, 4 years is pushing it.  My boyfriend right now is 4 years older, and he's great!  We have a lot in common and a lot of when I grew up with, he grew up with too.  I think anything more than 5 years and it'll be out of range....like, I can't talk to him about Pokemon because that's something his age group was too old for when the Red &amp; Blue games were released.  But that's okay, we have so many other things to relate to each other with.  And that forms an instant connection, when you can commiserate about stuff from childhood.  I'm sure it helps that my sister is the same age as my boyfriend, so I'm familiar with that generation's interests and issues.  I recall that my boss, who is 6 years older than me, called me an ""old soul"" once.  We were just chatting at a company party over wine, reminiscing about old video games and other borderline-crochety stuff, like how the Food Network used to be."

2) Last year, 3-day passes sold out within 3 hours of it going on-sale. 1-day GA and VIP passes sold out within a couple hours a week later.

4) I stayed at the [HI Chicago](http://hichicago.org/) hostel last year and it was pretty safe in general. It's about a block away from the park gates so it's a great location. If you're planning on going to any aftershows, just be aware of your surroundings and it should be fine. Rates are $49/night per person for a dorm style room (4 sets of bunk beds) and $129/night per person for a private room (1 bed). Alternative hostels include [Getaway Hostel](http://www.getawayhostel.com/), [Urban Holiday Lofts](http://urbanholidaylofts.com), and [IHSP Chicago](http://ihspusa.com).

My reasoning for staying in a hostel vs. a hotel is usually since it's a lot cheaper and I only really need it as a place to sleep for the night. It basically comes down to cost vs. comfort and convenience. If you can find a hotel near O'Hare, it might be cheaper per person per night but you still have to take the CTA (subway) in before/after the festival every day.

Especially in the southern US, where things like keeping the cold out isn't something that's seen as important in the housing code. That inadvertently has an effect on the types of materials used, air space in walls and roofs etc. 

To give a short example - many states in the US have a lower mandate for how much heat is allowed to be dissipated through walls than what is expected from the standard implementation of windows over here. So while I'm sitting in a building with walls made of several layers of brick and concrete a foot thick, I'm currently talking to an American friend who's walls consist of little more than glorified cardboard stapled to wooden beams. 

In terms of houses functioning as housing, this isn't an issue. But when fire starts wooden houses that make little to no use of fire retardant insulation will and do burn a lot faster. And at that point, requirements for fire extinguishers, specific layouts and the like isn't something that makes enough of a difference."

rising_son,Guitar,1390370223.0,"I find it hard to believe that think the Roland Cube amp lacking in distortion, doesn't it have some very high gain models built into it? Strat's aren't typically ""metal"" guitars but you could retrofit a new pickup to it. It sounds like a full size humbucker is what you need, but there are a variety of ""singlecoil sized"" humbuckers from DiMarzio, Seymour Duncan and other brands. These would be a good replacement if you do not want to buy a new scratch plate and just want to swap out the pickup.

Someone else mentioned the JB Jr. from Duncan, so won't say much about that, there are similar pickups from DiMarzio that use pretty much the same idea, except they use 2 parallel rails instead of individual poles. I have these in 2 of my guitars, a Fast Track in my Telecaster (makes Tele sound metal as fuck with the gain turned up) there is a strat version of this pickup as well. (can hear the sound of it in [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lmrtAnJ8gk) video, it's a sound demo I did, metal sound clip is at the end if you want to skip to it, not trying to plug my shit, just haven't seen many decent demos of this pickup before.

I have the DiMarzio cruiser (also singlecoil size humbucker) in the bridge position of another guitar, but it is a more refined sound, less output and sounds smoother overall, wound for lower output but still sounds good with high gain, but less bite than the Fast Track.

There are various other pickups from DiMarzio and Duncan that use the same concept, Duncan makes both Hotrails, and Cool Rails you can find them on [THIS](http://www.seymourduncan.com/products/electric/stratocaster/high-output/) page, and there are several other [DiMarzio](http://www.dimarzio.com/pickups/strat/hum-canceling-strat) ones too. On eBay there are some similar pickups by lesser-known brands, but I haven't tried any of these so can't really say much about them. As for the Duncan ones, I have played my mate's Strat that had a JB Jr, and in another strat, and liked the way it sounded, can't speak for the Cool Rails or Hot Rails though. I'm sure if you scour youtube you can find some good videos demonstrating how they sound."

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,DesignPorn,1390370230.0,"&gt; My requirements were to fulfill the role of currency not maintain the current illusioned iconic hegemony of symbols that are meant to pacify our urge to evolve as a society.

That's a cop out. If you were trying to play with updated currency, why even use bills? Why not mess with beads that can be worn on a string? Or a universal credit card?  

&gt; US National currency is only 150 years old and many of lordofnarf's bulletpoints are simply done because tradition...and no one is sure why, just that anyone who would change it must be a flag burnin' commie.

I've mentioned in a different comment that the US's relationship with history is extremely different than Europe. We are an very young country and unless you are native american you are not born knowing your family have lived here generation upon generation. Many of our countrymen are still first or second generation american. Europeans are much more secure in how they fit in their country, how their country fits into role in the world and world's history. You can wander down the street a actually see history. We don't have that as much or to as much depth as you. Therefore tradition symbols give us that foundation, gives us those ties to the beginning of our country and to ancestors who may not be our bloodline, but by becoming a citizen are now your ancestors too. Having a reminder of our history could be seen as a grounding and progressive thing and not pacifying our urge to to evolve as a society. It doesn't sound like to took our young history or how the is different in the american pysche instead of European. into consideration.


I'm starting to fall asleep so I only managed to write a barely coherent statement. It just feels that you did not make a currency for The United States, but make made it for the United States how you with them to be. You seem to almost have a disdain for the actual people who you are designing this for, and it comes across. The vagueness of the pictures you picked, the fact the even though humanitarianism seems to be the key goal there is not one human on the bills (maybe Astronaut could count). It doesn't seem like you attempted to get a feeling of america and of what makes us tick. The American is missing.

Wavooka,asktransgender,1390370248.0,"These aren't universal, but some principles that my doctor laid out when I asked her about how she treats trans patients are:

1. Always be compassionate and considerate. Use intake forms that allow a person state personal preferences and differentiate between legal/personal information. A trans woman may have a 'male' legal name, but chooses to go by a different 'female' in person. Your office should be capable of using the legal name where appropriate, and the personal one otherwise. 

2. Be truthful and direct. Also, don't act as though you're uncomfortable or sketchy towards your patient. If they need a sex-specific procedure, simply tell them that 'x' needs to be done. Avoid using terms (inappropriately) like: 'for a man/woman of your age' or 'as a male/female.'

I mean the great Dark Lord Belichek has certainly led a sketchy career that mars his good record, but Brady hasn't really done much except his job. You'll find just as many instances of Manning yelling at offensive linemen or receivers due to mistakes, but in both if you look at the tape they criticize themselves just as harshly. Brady doesn't even take himself that seriously; you can tell from his appearances in Family Guy or Entourage. The difference between him an Manning (who I choose as a comparison due to his high popularity despite similar career performance) is that he is wayyyy more awkward. Missing high-fives, dancing awkwardly... Nobody likes a handsome, successful loser. He gets hate solely because he performs on the field and doesn't outside of that.

When you are hungry, foods taste stronger because your body is more aware of sweet and/or salty sensations that usually signal edibility. Because the flavors are amplified/received more strongly, you often find that the food tastes better.

Interestingly enough, the study found that bitter foods do *not* taste stronger under these circumstances, and that they aren't prone to the same tasting better effect--most likely because bitterness usually signals *in*edibility."

SirJefferE,Showerthoughts,1390370486.0,"Not only that, but it increases their sales.

Pretend a lottery company has a 90% return rate. You pay $1 for a ticket and the average prize is worth 90 cents. But say instead they had a 1% chance of winning $50, a 40% chance of winning $1, and a 59% chance of getting nothing.

Say the average lottery player spends $5 a week on tickets. If there were one high prize and no low ones, the amount gained per person would be 50 cents per week, and the $4.50 extra would go to the top prize.

Now with lower prizes, as in my above example, the average player is going to spend $5 initially, but when he 'wins' $1 instead of pocketing it, he is *far* more likely to invest it in another ticket, and then another, and another, until he either wins bigger, or loses. It's very rare that somebody wins a dollar and walks away with it.

With $5 spent he will on average win another $2 in small prizes. When he invests his $2 he will on average another $.80 cents, which he will then probably lose. I could go further but I forget the proper way to figure it out.

Now instead of spending $5 a week on the lottery, by reinvesting the small winnings he's actually spending $7.80.

The lottery company can pretty reliable assume that they will make back a large percentage of the small prizes, and so they *really* only have to pay out the larger prize. This allows them to say things like, ""90% return!"" When in reality, most people playing won't see anything like that and only the large winners come out ahead.

As a small note, I don't know if I've ever seen a lottery company with as high a return as that."

But I mean, I don't think he's actually been that helpful towards the Lannisters, it's just that the circumstances seem much worse if you think back.

You brought up the Tyrells just allying with whomever is winning but there were no reasons to think that the war was gonna escalate at the start. It started off with Tywin harassing the Riverlands because they kidnapped Tyrion and the North joined because of the arrest of Ned Stark but there was no reason to believe that a much larger scale war was gonna break out.

Had Robert Baratheon not died (and keep in mind that this war technically started before he was dead), the war wouldn't have lasted long.

Had Stannis not known about Joffrey's illegitimate status or had Renly not been so terribly power-hungry, the war probably wouldn't have escalated more than a skirmish between the Riverlands and the North versus the Lannisters."

In Japan I find you get what you very correctly deemed ""painfully courteous"" across the board, but warm and friendly? That is another thing completely. 

I've come to the conclusion that Japan is a very much ""masked"" society. On the surface they are brilliant at customer service, making sure you need anything and everything you could possibly ask for, but is it genuine? From what I've experienced, most of the time, no. It's not. Making friends in Japan outside the ex-pat and foreign studies students circles is extremely difficult. They just aren't open...especially to foreigners. Okinawa and, a lot of the times, Osaka are the exceptions from what I can tell. 

Okinawa is easily explained. You have a small island that wasn't originally Japanese in the first place. So you have the original Okinawan culture still running through the society and of course the heavy American population there.

codayus,webdev,1390370703.0,"Okay, first question:  Is this meant to be a desktop app, mobile app, SPA webapp, or traditional webapp?

The desktop app (and *maybe* the SPA and mobile app) options I'd probably expect some sort of architecture like this:

**1. Version check:** On initial load, send a check to a central server with a hash (or date) of your card DB.  ""Hey, I've got the 2014-01-22T18:35:04+13:00 version of the DB; got anything newer for me?"".  If yes, goto 2, otherwise goto 3.

**2. Load DB:** If you don't have an initial DB (or have an outdated DB) you want the client to suck down an update, delivered (probably) in the form of a massive JSON blob of data (probably excluding images, maybe including thumbnails base64 encoded as strings).  The update should be stored locally; SQLite for a desktop app, IndexedDB in a SPA, or appropriate native data store in a mobile app.  How should these JSON blobs be stored and delivered?  Well, honestly, store them as plain text and deliver them via S3 is honestly best.  They're unchanging except for when WoTC releases new cards or errata, so why involve a DB at all at this step?

**3. Init:**  Now that you know you have the latest card DB, go ahead an init your app and deck builder interface.  For a crude solution, just load all the cards into memory; for a more complicated solution you can query the local DB they're stored in.

**4. Deck building:** As the users builds a date, you can store a simple representation in memory.  A list of card ids is probably enough, although you could *potentially* do something clever where you store a hash of ids and quantities, so if he has 40 swamps you store [..., {id: 'swampUUID', quantity: 40}, ...] and not [..., 'swampUUID', 'swampUUID', ... 'swampUUID', ...].  As for images, you probably want to fetch them from S3 as needed, and optionally cache them locally.

**5. Deck saving:**  Some local cacheing is desirable, probably alongside the main card DB.  But eventually you'll want to save them to the cloud.  Should you denormalise them and store a full card doc for every card in every deck for every user?  Unless you **NEED** it (for, eg, some sort of searching or something), then fuck no.  Store the same list of card IDs you use in RAM, along with some meta data about date created, date edited, owner, etc.  Simple.

**6. Deck loading:**  On load (and periodically thereafter) query the server to see if there's any deck updates you don't have.  If so, grab them.  Could check for main card DB updates too.  Could have a manual ""please check"" button.  Could check for app updates too.  :)


In short, I'd imagine a client-server architecture where the client runs a simple DB (maybe just an in-memory store) like IndexDB, LevelDB, SQLite), and caches the main card DB, and also stores the minimal representation of the various decks.  On the server, I'd probably store the card DB on disk as JSON blobs, although in principle there's no problem with storing it in Mongo if you don't exceed the size constraints.  But this is sort of an ideal use for a file system.  :)  Storing decks is a good use for MongoDB, so that's fine.  But I wouldn't bother with any fancy denormalization or joins or map/reduce; you basically just need to be able to query to find out if there are new/updated decks your client doesn't have, retrieve them if necessary, and save new/updated decks as required.

The next question is search; search will be much faster if it's done clientside, but search is a hard problem, and for best results you probably want to feed your card DB into elasticsearch or something.  Either way, search is probably going to be implemented seperately from the rest of the app.  Helpfully, I don't see any reason you need to search decks, just the main card DB, so you basically can index that whenever it changes, and then just proceed from there.


If you're going for a traditional webapp (and maybe a mobile or SPA app, depending on design), then it's all a bit different; you don't have a client as such, just a server.  This is pretty standard so I won't go into details, but basically every action will end up hitting the DB.  User searches for cards stoarting for ""for"", user adds 3 forests to his deck, user wants to see the flavour text of the ""wooly mammoth"" card; each one would be a round trip to the server.  Pretty basic stuff, so I won't go into any real depth.


Basically, what it comes down to is this:  You have some *SUPER* static data in the form of the main card DB; you probably need it to be searchable, but it doesn't really need to be editable.  Storing it in Mongo is kind of optional; it would work as a static file.  You also have some very dynamic deck data (which is a good use case for Mongo, honestly), but it doesn't seem like you need to denormalize it.  (Or do you?  If you want to be able to search for, eg, all decks containing a card with type knight, then you either needs joins or denormalization.  If you only want to display the cards during deck building, then you probably don't.)"

HigherSocietyTDM,Psychonaut,1390370931.0," I always think of there being a kind of line that's drawn between those things that are animate, spiritual, knowing, feeling and the purely physical. To me, the universe is the largest and the all-encompassing physical unit. It's comprised of varying forms of matter: Galaxies Stars, planets, atoms, and smaller particles. It has given rise to all these things throughout it's history. On the other side of the line is the spirit world. Living things are squarely on the line. We are not purely physical. Unlike purely physical things we don't swing aimlessly, randomly through the universe like the stars and planets. We are bound by the laws of physics, because we came out of the physical universe. However, we can make our own decisions. We can learn. We can see and understand. We can walk uphill, instead of merely falling downward like rocks from a mountaintop. What you're saying doesn't sound crazy, but in my mind it seems a bit misguided. The universe is infused with animate beings, but it is not itself animate. More like a tool used to create vehicles to carry souls to maturity, so that when the physical shell expires, they don't merely dissipate, but live forever."

nerowasframed,AskReddit,1390371215.0,"I can't stand St Louis style barbecue. That's all we really have in the northeast. Sweet Baby Ray's and KC Masterpiece. If you go to a restaurant or if you're have a barbecue where the sauce is homemade, it's always modeled after St Louis style barbecue sauce. And I can't stand it. It's super thick, super sweet nasty ass shit. I feel like it overpowers the taste of the meat. You might as well just be drinking the barbecue sauce like a milkshake. When I do my own barbecues, I like just a nice spicy dry rub. That's it. The dry rub adds a nice spicy kick without hiding any natural flavor of the meat.

I've had barbecue down in Tennessee, and the sauce was very thin and vinegar-y. I've also had barbecue in South Carolina where the sauce was a mustard sauce. They were both delicious. I can't understand how the sweet St Louis style is more popular than either of those types or even just a basic dry rub."

Then he turns around a gives a 9.8 to Balotelli (who has 80 agility). If bad agility can kill the score for one player, why does it not for another? Also he changes his standards for a lot of players. Another nitpick: on some of them ""3 star skills"" or ""High/High workrates"" will be a weakness and others it won't be for seemingly no reason at all other than he wanted to add more fluff to his review.

Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1390371370.0,"Not exactly on topic, but you mentioned that you picked up some cheap software. More people should be made aware of this: Adobe Photoshop CS2 is available *technically* free. More accurately, Adobe stopped running their authentication servers (which made it impossible for legit copies to run), so instead of outright ceasing support of the software, they made it freely available without any sort of authentication.

[Check out this article for more information](http://gizmodo.com/5973730/grab-photoshop-and-cs2-for-absolutely-free-right-here).

CS2 contains more than enough for someone paint digitally (I started Photoshop 7, before they even started the CS line). It won't make you paint better, but having a decent application with which to paint wouldn't hurt.

As for how to start, open up the program, grab the hard round brush, make sure its opacity is set to be controlled by Pen Pressure (you'll find this under Window&gt;Brush, and within that palette where the 'Opacity Jitter' option is). Then pick a VERY SIMPLE photograph, perhaps one of a single, simple fruit (an apple, an orange) and attempt to paint what you see.

Don't get caught up in the detail, focus purely on large masses of colour.

Some good extra reading would be [my critique (along with the included paintover to get a better idea of what I mean)](http://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalPainting/comments/1vjeoh/complete_art_beginner_looking_for_advicecritique/ceswyp3) of the fruit still-life /u/cactuas did."

In a relationship I will have sex often, and I dont know about you, but I dont care for having bad sex often. If youre cool with condom sex, then congratulations, I hate it. It takes away too much of the pleasure for me. If Im in a relationship and she refuses to go on the pill, then I wont sacrifice my pleasure forever with her, its not happening. It wont work.

Also, the only reason I use a condom with a ONS is to avoid STDs. As far as masturbating and having sex with a condom, I am not sure how you can really comment on that on my behalf. I enjoy masturbating far more than condom-sex. We all need intimacy tho at times, so when the need arises, a ONS covers it."

When teaching the the form, my friend told me to curve (opposite way of round) my back as much as possible to protect my back.

redwhiskeredbubul,postpunk,1390371591.0,"My main observation is that this is a great basis for a great playlist or mixtape, but gives a weird sense of the relative importance of bands. For example, you have the Lemon Kittens record on here (really obscure) but not the X-Ray Spex (not all that obscure). Maybe a product of youtube?  

1.) Because it's albums by bands, you miss out on comps. _No New York_, the _Wanna Buy a Bridge_ Rough Trade comp, and the C86 comp, (since you mention twee/jangle pop) are all really key. 

2.) Some key bands that aren't here, and funny representation of labels and scenes: The Swell Maps, Gary Numan, Alternative TV, Josef K,  The Electric Eels (if we're going to Cleveland), The Cocteau Twins (the only 4AD record is the Rema Rema record) Section 25, A Certain Ratio (the one Factory records band is Joy Division)   The Buzzcocks (but you have Magazine) The Minutemen (no SST), Cabaret Voltaire, etc.  

3.) overall it's heavy on the post- and light on the -punk. So if you look at the Wanna Buy a Bridge comp, there's a stiff little fingers song.  If you've seen the Urgh! video, there's the Dead Kennedys on there along with Klaus Nomi and the Au Pairs.

PatHeist,news,1390371795.0,"Yes, gypsum based drywall is very good at preventing heat convection between rooms and to load bearing elements. Until the water has boiled out, the drywall disintegrates, and the insulation free space inside of the walls exposes all load bearing elements completely, and allows for very good air flow. Also, dry wall used thinly, in single layers, is terrible at preventing fire spread in terms of total time before collapse.

The walls do perform well in earthquakes, though. There's no denying that - and they often exist in conditions where this is a requirement. There are other things though, like extreme wind conditions, where US building code is woefully inadequate. 

In many cases, it's not bad because the code is bad, but because the building code was written very well for the materials and techniques around a long time ago - when most of the building codes were written. But with new materials and new construction techniques, there have come new ways in which one can meet the building codes without actually producing functionally good buildings. In an unfortunate and ironic way, strong early standards are working disfavorably today.

It is, very much, a subject of things that weren't necessarily overlooked, but antiqued codes that would have been written better today. Where else than the US does everyone cover their floors entirely with (potentially) very flammable carpets? Where else can houses be both mass produced and placed easily in a large portion of the country without a need for laying a deep foundation? How many places have extreme winds, the technology to build very light houses, and no issue with damp ocean winds or high rain conditions? These are all things that affect how buildings perform, but that didn't need to be addressed when the currently applied building codes were written."

whitneyface,neopets,1390372152.0,"People would probably love to get the value in all Gift Box Capsules, because the boxes that come from them are at such a premium for traders. On that note, you can't just send someone a GBC, you have to send them one GBC per gift box, which you can either get when you redeem NC cards (1 box per $5 on the card) or from the GBCs themselves (1-4 boxes with the possibility of one additional Limited Edition box, I believe). So that would be ~12 (I don't know the precise value of NY in Faerieland since Filligrees is a bit out of date) boxes, plus that many GBCs.

If you don't have that many boxes, I would suggest waiting until there is an NC mall event with a big ticket item you can trade one or two of (maybe some kind of daily event with ten- or twenty-packs of whatever the event is about, in Christmas it was stockings) so you spend fewer boxes sending the items, or wait until the Birthday Mystery Capsules are back in the mall (not sure of the time of year here, someone help me out?) and either buy a bunch of caps and try your luck (possible but risky) or try trading then, when there will potentially be more on the market.

I hope this helps! Others know more, but I know a little. Good luck!

Nausved,BuyItForLife,1390372215.0,"My boyfriend and I have had three $30-70 blenders, and they *all* broke after less than 25 uses each (and two of them after *much* less than 25 uses, including the $70 one). They also took a long time with lots of starting and stopping (to tamp the fruit down with a spoon), and they were a bitch to clean. We ended up making smoothies only 2-4 times a month—until they broke.

I'd love to know what blender you're using. It sounds like a great brand.

In the meantime, my boyfriend received an OmniBlend V as a present, which is a high-grade blender like Vitamix and Blendtec. It is zippy, it doesn't have to be stopped for tamping, it is self-cleaning, and it shuts itself off if it gets too hot (so we don't worry about burning out the motor like we did with our old blenders). We use it pretty much every day, sometimes several times a day. 

It's so pleasant to use and clean that we've started using it for non-smoothie activities, too, like mixing batter and grinding rice flour. It's cheaper (albeit somewhat less powerful) than a Vitamix or Blendtec, and similarly durable. It has definitely made cooking much less of a chore."

Wavooka,TumblrInAction,1390372402.0,"&gt; I think it's SJWish to be so fucking stubborn about things like that with friends, coworkers, etc..

I'm a trans girl that is fairly stubborn about my pronouns. I can see both sides of the issue. I've had friends transition/change their pronouns on me, and it was difficult to adapt. But no one was upset, because it was understood that slipping on a pronoun was simply that- slipping up. 

I think the reason that some are so stubborn is because we have people in our lives who misgender us consistently, without regard to actually making an attempt to be respectful. 

I started transitioning when I was 19 (&gt;2 years ago) and I still have people who consistently use the wrong pronoun. *At some point it ceases to be an issue of 'ingrained habits' instead of 'general asshole behavior.'*"

I'm a gay male.  Granted, I'm white and I'm 'straight-acting' in that I don't have stereotypical mannerisms, so I don't deal with systemic issues personally, but I live in a very liberal area that attracts a lot of people who otherwise would and in some cases still do deal with systemic issues, people that I care about.  I'm very much in favor of the core ideas of social justice and I'm even in favor of talking about them and discussing them, but a part of engaging in a public dialogue means coming at it from the point of an adult.

What I make fun of on here tend to be people who have jumped onto the bandwagon of social justice basically as a game.  Take a look at, say, otherkin, or that post the other day by someone who was, what was it?  ""Queer platonic?""  It's people like that who I make fun of, people who are basically playing around with subjects that legitimately impact people's lives, as if moral outrage was a fun pasttime for them to engage in, as if they're jealous that they can't act hurt and oppressed, too.  That's bullshit and it's damaging to people who are trying to get actual work done and to bridge real gaps.

I'm not about to respect or lend credence to the opinions of someone who thinks that 'queer' includes out-and-out heterosexuals basically because they want to be special, or that, say, being of a religion other than the prevailing faith of your culture constitutes cultural appropriation, and as someone who actually does try to work for a better and more just society for groups who have been putting up with actual bullshit for a really long time, it's really frustrating to have a bunch of loud voices on the internet trying to speak for you in the most alienating way possible.

Ok, so there's more to it than that - it appeals to us on many different levels.  It shows we're being civilised without making a huge song &amp; dance about it.  It allows us to partake in the national sport of grumbling and low-level complaining.  When the bus is late, or equivalent, we can share a glance with our fellow queue person and, without speaking, communicate that far-reaching idea of 'Typical!  This again, huh?'

And it allows us to feel morally superior to other nationalities who either cannot or will not queue in an orderly way.  When we see other people bump and push their way through the door we can sigh and tut and wish everyone knew of the calm, resigned aspect of an orderly queue.  ""We're all in this together, folks!"" ought to be the motto.  But we don't need to say it.  Some things do not need to be said.  Some things just 'are'.

Plus, there is the innate curiosity of the British.  We didn't invent so much stuff by not being curious.  And when we see an existing queue we need to join it - what's at the front of the queue?  Who knows, but it must be good, otherwise why is everyone else queuing?

I was working under the assumption that we, the supers, were basically average individuals granted powers therefore we don't actually have a lot of resources at our disposal other than what we would normally have. 

If you however also had huge resources at your disposal then that makes things a lot easier. I mean, that's basically batman level with superpowers. But, I'd say that even with that, it would still prove difficult for a lot of people. Invisibility doesn't cover sound so enemies could hear you sneak up on them. That would be risky but if it works it would be really effective. Combining that with mental assault would probably work.

I'm not too sure on about the rules regarding telepathy. If you can simply hear surface thoughts of people around without having to target them that would help in avoiding attacks directed at you as you can hear them thinking about attacking you. I imagine delving into other people's mind would require a fair bit of concentration so in active combat that could be risky. Illusions would work well as psychological attacks/distractions though. 

If you're against enemies that you are prepared for then there's not much they can do to stop you. If you were against random enemies it becomes much harder to dominate against them although the tides would still be in your favor. 

Anubis's power only works on possession that they value. I'm not sure people really puts a lot of value into mere bullets. I'd say only mementos or anything of similar worth would count. And even then I can't say how effective that would be in the middle of combat. It would give you an advantage for sure though."

I generally try to buy time, I clear my throat, start out saying complete nonsense like ""Well... What you have to understand is... What... The thing is..."" other nonsense like that. 

More time for thinking. 

I especially hate when this happens in class when I've not got anything interesting to say because I haven't finished thinking it through, and my professor just picks me because I don't talk much.

On a less ""right this second"" scale, I try to quickly pick one aspect to focus heavily on. I focus on that, I come back to it, I use it as an example, it becomes sort of a general theme of my speech/discussion. And I pray that no one calls me on my generalizations or oversimplifications. If they do, which does sometimes happen, I usually say that I'm aware of that but for the sake of time didn't want to dive into it. Which is true, from a certain point of view.

For something like an unexpected phone call, I have my mini panic attack, and then focus on slowing down or drawing out the conversation while I get a handle on things. I prioritize what needs to be known, said, remembered, asked, and written down. 

I used to be really bad at phone conversations, I still am on a personal level, but more formal conversations became a breeze when I realized it's not the end of the world if I ask them to repeat themselves, or ask what I might consider a ""stupid"" question."

Lady_of_Shalott,raisedbynarcissists,1390372797.0,"Hi, I've mentioned this before but I'm a student studying psychology (among other things).

Although it is common belief that traumatic memories might be repressed, research tends to conflict with this belief. In fact, many victims of trauma *cannot* forget (e.g., PTSD). And there's a lot of data that suggests that false memories can be easily created, even including false memories of impossible events (e.g., meeting Bugs Bunny at Disneyland). Misinformation can produce false memories of trauma, such as would be the case if your Nmom is lying to you. Your memories of being afraid of your uncle could very well be confirmation bias at work after your Nmom planted the seed of worry in your brain.

In conclusion: Unless you remembered this before your Nmom ever planted the idea in your head, there is nothing to suggest you were actually molested. **It's far more likely that she's doing her Nmom thing, and actively trying to sabotage your mental health.**

My other aunt, 62 this year, just paid a surrogate to have a baby to her husband because she is also childless but 'wants one of her own' What *that* aunt is doing disgusts me.

- honestly, a guy who reacts negatively to receiving flowers from you should probably be examined more closely in terms of his relationship with you.  the absolute worst case acceptable scenario where this guy likes you and isn't into flowers is a polite ""thank you"" and him avoiding faking too much enthusiasm over something he's not that into.

They're to make sure the other person isn't a psychopath and that there's at least enough chemistry to start out with.  You're seeing if a first date is worth going on.  In my experience, if there's going to be a date, it's discussed on the first meeting.  I remember one time, the conversation wasn't awful, we hung out for a couple hours, and then we never saw each other again.  There just wasn't anything there - we both knew it, there was no reason to waste each other's time.

Otherwise, I always end the date with something like ""we should do something again soon"" or ""got anything going on next Friday?""  or ""I know a cool restaurant if you want to try checking it out next week.""  I HATE leaving something like that up in the air.  At the end of the date or whatever you want to call it, it should always be clear that there will be another if you want another."

RJ815,truegaming,1390373622.0,"If I had to use one word, I'd probably say: conservative... which is a weird thing to say considering that they've probably pushed gimmicks the most out of any console company, to varying degrees of success. But if you exclude the hardware gimmick factor, first party game design seems to be pretty conservative, not changing a whole lot since the 80's and 90's. And even if things do change from time-to-time, it's usually within an established IP rather than something new. I feel this conservatism has both good and bad results. On one hand, Nintendo games are often nostalgia fuel incarnate, allowing people to relive childhood memories and even share similar experiences with their children. This conservatism has also mostly prevented them from joining in on the many bad habits of the modern game industry like horrid microtransactions, DLC issues, DRM bullshit, and the ""fuck it, fix it with patches later"" mentality. On the other hand, Nintendo seems to have underemphasized the benefits that modern technology offers, like improved graphics and processing capabilities, not to mention the various capabilities that more online connectivity affords. So, they have good aspects, but I think it's fair to say that they're behind the times and that they've certainly beaten certain franchises to a bloody pulp in terms of sequels and spin-offs."

Once you leave that territory, however, 1-2g of rehydrated dry yeast per gallon of must is common. Sometimes you'll hear 1g per gallon for normal gravity musts (around the gravity of grape wine), and 1.25g per gallon for higher gravity musts.

1. It's really unfair that he gets upset that you have prior sexual experience. He's welcome to ask you not to discuss certain topics with him, but he cannot tell you what you can and cannot talk about with other people (except if he's saying, ""don't talk about [insert topic that has to do with him or your personal relationship] for privacy""). Everyone has some type of past. That's life. He should accept it.

2. Your boyfriend should not be controlling about the way you dress or your self-expression through piercings. If he doesn't like your piercings, he should find a girl without piercings.

3. This is the biggest one. Your guy friends are exactly that: *friends*. His jealousy and controlling nature, via constantly texting you and asking you when you are coming home, is concerning. It sounds like he's a puddle jump away from telling you not to hang out with them at all.

Actually, I think the biggest red flag is that you feel ashamed. Your boyfriend should not make you feel ashamed for any part of your personality. He doesn't trust you around other guys, he says, because he wants to control who you hang out with. If you don't feel comfortable talking to your own boyfriend, it's a serious sign that things need to end, IMO."

I just reread your post, and I really think that including what you want to do with him after the break up will help him (light at the end of the tunnel sorta). Whether he wants to/you want to help him find a new long term girlfriend, or take him to a bar and get him laid, or something in between.

Have empathy for others who are struggling. Don't think you need to jump in with suggestions based on what worked for you.

One thing I find successful guys do with me is try to fix me by giving out unsolicited advice and suggestions. I had to cut many of them out of my life because I felt uncomfortable being told how to live my life by someone who hasn't had the same challenges. In some cases, I thought I was doing fine before they started advising me on how I could improve. I would rather they just empathized and asked me if I wanted their advice.

Remember some of us were not raised to feel we would rise to become leaders of industry. Trying to convince someone otherwise might not be the best idea, even if you believe they are capable.

This is actually what I plan on doing, but in real-time with real people as opposed to videos. My plan is to -- again, since I had done it on DayZ mod -- get a group of guys and train them up to where they need to be with basic infantry tactics and manuevers. I think that the videos of us using the tactics would interest enough people to make it worthwhile even if they don't understand the ""why"" things are done certain ways.

I just haven't yet decided if I want to stick with DayZ mod or switch to DayZ SA. The system for changing weapons concerns me. In the mod, I just used the key I already had bound to rapidly switch to secondary. So far, it's not looking like that is an option in SA which is a real concern for me. Rapidly switching to secondary weapons is integral to my gunplay.

Anyway. If I end up creating some videos (first person only is mandatory IMO), I'll be sure to post them on the sub."

Liberals like government because they don't believe that an absence thereof provides good results. We believe that, for example, if you eliminated all social safety nets, that people would literally DIE. We believe that if you eliminated regulations people would be forced to work 14 hour days, 7 days a week, in unsafe conditions or starve. That the world would be polluted because there's no environmental regulations, etc. Quite frankly, we support government programs and safety nets because they provide people with a sense of economic security and help make the world a better place for millions of people. We dont like to tax people for the sake of taxing people, but the money for these programs has to come from somewhere obviously.

As for the federal vs state issues, it's just the fact that the feds have a better track record of looking out for people. The feds had to step in to stop the states from enslaving people, and a century later had to go in and force them to recognize blacks as equals, for example. 6 or so states nominally ban atheists from holding public office, while the federal government provides freedom of religion. The feds just have a better record, historically.

We support a smaller military because we spend more than the next 20 countries combined.

We support less energy production and more focus on renewables due pollution and global warming.

We support gun control because thousands of people die from guns each year (although I'm mixed on the issue and have a conservative slant to it due to the constitution). "

mundabit,ChronicPain,1390374967.0,"I'm in a polyamorous relationship. Its what's right for me as an individual, Its something I always wanted. But its just happened to also be the best thing for my pain too. having a third person in the relationship means my partner has someone to turn to when he needs to vent about me. He has someone who is active and able to take on real dates and have fun with. She fills the gaps I can't, and I fill the gaps she can't, and as a team we have all the bases covered. Its sound a bit wrong to think about it like that, don't get me wrong my relationship started and formed around attraction and emotions, But I'm breaking in down to explain it online.

on a fundamental level relationships are about give and take. Giving needs to make you feel good just as much as receiving makes you feel good. But I just can't give as much as a healthy person, and that makes me sad. I can't have sex or go out a lot, so my partner is unable to give as much as he wants. The solution is to give to someone else, and to let them give to us, so that we all give and receive as much as we want and need to feel satisfied. 

I ws already dating my partner (male) when I started to get really ill. He knew that I had medical issues before we started dating, we had been friends for a while. We were in highschool (different ones) and he and I were both virgins in all senses, we agreed to be in an open LDR, to see where it lead us, after a few years we realised it was leading some place good, it was fun, it felt right, so we decided to be exclusive. I moved in as soon as I graduated, and our state now recognises us as a married couple, we consider that a good representation of our relationship. 

He got me into body building and I taught him how to hike and camp. But I started getting sicker and sicker, and he started getting more depressed that our weekly hikes became weekly 'watch youtube from my bed' nights instead. Initially I was very sexual, typical horny teenager. But vulvodynia and endometriosis took an obvious toll on my ability to have sex, while fatigue and joint pain effected other sexual activities. A barrage of medication killed what was left of my sex drive. I kept reinforcing my opinions on monogomy, making sure he knew that he was free to get anything he wanted from places outside our relationship, after a few months, we had a serious discussion on this because there was a girl at work he fancied.  We went out to dinner with her so she could get to know me too. It was about 2 months before she understood what it is we were looking for and felt she could be a part of that, she's going to be moving in with us when we move to our new place and I'm really looking forward to having someone else to cook for and care for (I hate kids, but I still like being a homemaker) and she's looking forward to having the next best thing to a sister.

Compared to our friends, our relationship feels pretty stable. You obviously need a lot of communication and honesty to make this work. This has made it really easy to deal with chronic pain in my relationship, because its just expected that you speak your mind, any and all emotions get laid on the table and sorted through daily. We all know where we stand. To an outsider we probably all seem a little autistic the way we talk about our feelings. But hey, 8 years and counting, its working so far. We've had hiccups. Homelessness, bankruptcy, medical emergencies, relocations, long distance, dead bedroom, and so on, Communication really is key, and a lack of compromise is the lock.

I had it easy, having a partner before you get sick is like playing in cheat mode. I'm really sorry you are struggling to find someone because of your pain, I feel like there should be a website for people with chronic pain trying to find love. Finding someone who is also in pain is one way to know they wont leave you just because of yours, but something else to consider is that some people have a strong calling to caring for others, and having a partner with pain might make them feel complete."

I'd say my aim isn't actually death of people. More like wide spread chaos enough that the city is unable to function stably. Pretty much breaking down the social structure. Mark of Morrigan to starts up riots, and hallucinogens to drive people crazy.

We don't know how detailed the precog ability is. If it's just vauge general events then I should be safe. If it shows every vital information that they choose to see then They would have to have prior knowledge of what they want to see. I wouldn't count on a precog to see that detailed into the future.

Like if I continue to do small attacks, would they think that I was planning a big one too? They probably wouldn't and so they wouldn't think about looking for it. If they could see a large attack coming, they might know who and when, but that wouldn't exactly tell them all the how. 

Generally speaking, I'm hoping to cause enough havoc to to keep heros preoccupied. Heros can only do so much. Starting a riot is easy; stopping one is a lot harder. Contaminating drinking water is simple; purifying it isn't. It's easy to try to focus on the culprit but are they going to chase me while all of this is going on?

I will say while I'm not certain, I do think they wanted to provoke the situation.

I know Churchill made 'looking after the jews' rather synonymous with crushing the third reich while they were still in the process of being put into ghettoes, long before anyone planned putting them into labour/concentration camps.

One thing we hear a lot about are all the people resisting the start of the 'communist war' as they called it to begin with; after all, communism was a big thing (not majority, but still a fair bit of traction) before the war. As it turned out, the vast majority didn't stand up for it, but a lot did. What we don't hear about so much is that a bigger percentage of the US protested the war; mostly on a general anti-war basis.

If you got an american textbook view of history, every war (since and including the revolutioinary war) before the vietnam war except for the one against mexico and the trail of tears (the only ones against non-whites, how convenient) were totally morally justified, and every war after and including the vietnam war were totally terrible. (Iraq and Vietnam are disputed, but there's still a big majority against them) Except for the one in Kosovo, which again, was against white people.

PatHeist,buildapc,1390375972.0,"What?

AMD's GPU department is stretched to its limits. They're not even profitable. AMD is literally mainly around because Intel and Nvidia would be monopolies otherwise. They've even gone out to warn shareholders that they're only temporarily profitable at the moment because of holiday console sales, and that over time that might not show up as a profitable move for them. Hopefully they can hold on to their profitability status with their progression in APUs and the laptop market, though. But at the moment, it's all loss mitigation in trying to catch up to Nvidia and Intel *and* then be able to be properly profitable.

The AMD GPUs and CPUs both need significantly more cores and higher clock speeds to keep up with their Intel and Nvidia counterparts. So much so that they've had significant heat issues time and time again. Right now they have a consumer CPU out that can overheat to the point of throttling itself when *idle* if you have the audacity to fit the cooler that generally comes as stock to it. And their GPU line is one of leaf blowers.

Also, you probably remember when they released their new GPUs, and Nvidia practically laughed at them, massively price slashing the 770 and 780? Before releasing a card that's up to and above 25% more powerful than AMD's top of the line card in both gaming and synthetic benchmarks. With a better stock cooler, massive overclocking headroom, and an encoding chip on board.

Some of the AMD GPUs are better price/fps at the moment, but they fall behind a lot of the time on even that. 

They did get their crossfire and microstuttering under control, though, which is wonderful."

Even if it *were* true, there is *no possible good* that can come out of dwelling on your Nmom's claim, only mental anguish.

I'm quite enjoying studying psychology, although I admit when I first started college I kinda had this idea in my head that it would have ""all the answers"" and I'd come out of it with the ability to always know the right thing to say or do, and understand why the traumatic elements of my past happened the way I did and be able to be at peace with them. I think I looked to it as a sort of religion, haha.

But in reality, it really depends on what you intend to do with it. A lot of people sign up for psych thinking they'll become a therapist someday, but at my uni, the psychology program is pretty heavily research/academics-oriented and light on the clinical. And if you major in just psych you should probably be prepared to go to grad school afterward, because there aren't a lot of jobs in the field for BAs.

I have a 2nd major (basically focusing on community mental health and substance abuse services) that is far more applied and career-training in nature but I'm under the impression the program is specific to my school. You can probably find something similar elsewhere if you look, though. Or maybe other schools have more clinically-focused psych programs. I didn't really look around at other school's programs tbh because I just decided to go to my local state school when I finally got around to attempting college.

If you have any more questions I'd be happy to answer them, but I'm probably going to bed in the next hour or so."

What this does is the following
Working with your example of 203

* Works out the integer of 203/100 (2 Years) and multiplies it by -1
* Works out the Remainder of 203/100 (3 Months) and multiplies it by -1
* Does a DateAdd of Years of Now - 2 Years (from Step 1)
* Does a DateAdd of Months of Now - 3 Months (from Step 2)

Now because this will change every time you run the script (or code block) you could do this to make it display only the important information. 

    Format(DateAdd(""yyyy"", (Int([CraziestDateFormatEver]/100)*-1), DateAdd(""m"", ([CraziestDateFormatEver] Mod 100)*-1, Now())), ""mm/yyyy"")

soitcause,changemyview,1390376666.0,"&gt; I was impressed with the stupid pickup attempts I received, anything from ""a flower for you (drawn with ASCII)"" to ""I'll tear your butthole open with an excavator"" (or something worse).

Not speaking so much to the quality, but more to the expectation: what the hell do [women] expect when they sign up for online dating services? No one knows anything meaningful about you so the reality is that the ""deepest"" initial response is going to be something that somewhat relates to some hobby you listed. Further, is it really likely that, out of the tens/hundreds/thousands of messages you get that the one that makes a vague, value-neutral comment about your interest is going to stand out?

Granted, I'm not saying that men telling you they want to sodomize you is cool, but you shouldn't be expecting some Casanova to emerge from the crowd of social misfits and steal your heart. People are going to make sexual advances toward you (especially on more casual oriented sites like fetlife and okcupid). Sex *is* what they're looking for. From their perspective, you're *also* looking for sex or else you wouldn't have a profile. It's not them ""turning you into a piece of meat"" anymore than someone turns you into a piece of meat when you have sex; just because your body is a means to an end doesn't mean they can't/won't try to satisfy you to the same extent. 

I think the men/masculinity/whatever as being predatory in nature thing is a tired trope. Clearly women are also interested in getting off. If you join a community that is mostly men, you should expect those men to use communication styles and have expectations that reflect a male perspective on relational dynamics. I don't think many people would take issue with women making more passive advances toward men in more traditional spaces (with the expectation that men should pick up on it and ""man up"" and initiate formal contact) viewed nearly as negatively, though the problem is parallel. I don't want to say that basing your perceptions of real people on the comments of what strangers on the internet say is exactly stupid, but I think it's a bit misguided. *No one* in your real life has the same lack of accountability due to anonymity.

It may sound gross, but the constant water and drying agitates your hair. And once it gets long enough use a straightener if you need to.

Also make sure to get a sort of layered hair cut so that your hair can fit together better.

Simbablk,sex,1390377251.0,"I offer the following:

- Have one ride your cock while the other rides your face (eat her pussy).
Have them switch so they both get a chance at getting their pussy eaten and riding your cock.

- Have them lay side by side. Eat one pussy for a while then switch to the other. Finger girl B while you eat the pussy of girl A. If either girl is near orgasm, DON'T SWTICH! Make her cum, then switch and make the other cum.

- Still on their backs side-by-side, fuck girl A while fingering girl B. Switch. Again, if either girl you're fucking is close to cumming, do NOT stop! Fuck her and make her cum.

- Bend them both over. Fuck girl A - finger girl B. Switch. Remember about making them cum.

- If on a sofa, position girl A on her back and fuck her. Have girl B sit on the back of the sofa and above girl A's head and eat her pussy.

**If they're into it...**

- Bend girl A over and fuck her. Have girl B position herself to have girl A eat her pussy. Switch
- Fuck girl A on her back while girl B rides her face (getting her pussy eaten). Suck girl B's breasts while you fuck girl A while she's eating girl B's pussy. Switch.

- While fucking girl A, have girl B get under you and lick your cock/balls while you're fucking girl A. Switch.

- On her back, eat girl A's pussy while girl B sits on her face (girl A eating girl B). Switch.

**At no point should you...**

- Fuck either of them in the ass then move to their pussy. Stick with anal if you're doing anal. Switch condoms if you're moving to pussy.

- Fuck any girl then move straight away to fucking the other unless they are okay with it. If you all are STI free then it should be fine, but fucking any girl and having her pussy juice on your cock is a health risk to the other girl if you don't know your STI status.

- Cum in any girl's pussy unless you're sure she's on birth control.

**Do...**

- Wear a condom.
- Try your best to make each girl cum at least once.
- And most of all have fun!!

knocklessmonster,edmproduction,1390377282.0,"I pirated FL Studio 7 six years ago, after writing a track in Audacity using a calculator and its waveform generators.  I couldn't afford DAW software at the time.  I felt bad, so I deleted it, and moved to the best looking free thing I could find:  Milkytracker.

I used it for a couple years, and then moved to ModPlug Tracker.  I liked the fact I could use VSTs and samples.  Eventually I grew tired of using VSTs for everything, and decided to check out Buzz, which had its own native format, and was available entirely for free.  Seriously, there are some awesome Buzz generators.

I used it for a while, but got frustrated with the interface.  I switched to Renoise last summer, and bought FL Studio Signature bundle because it's a steal (free updates, plus Maximus, which is an amazing plugin), but I don't use it much.  I love both, but use Renoise almost exclusively because I don't *need* synthesizers for it (in the 3.0 beta, you can do some good subtractive synthesis with single-cycle waveforms)."

If they are to get a girlfriend, and get married, then sure, that volume of dates could be wrong. If you just want to go out, have fun, meet new people, flirt, hook up, then it could work just fine. Even if your goal IS to get into a serious relationship, dating is a numbers game. This also depends on what your definition of a date is. I usually use the term very loosely.

Yes but that could easily be because he was just hit by a 190 lb man who was running towards him faster than a pedestrian sprint. He was standing on the toes of his right foot a split second before he got hit, and by the time he was actually hit his right foot was in the air. He was off balance and was moved forwards.

&gt;Why would you step forward knowing someone was running at you/towards the field?

Because, assuming that's what happened, your initial knee-jerk reaction isn't always the proper defensive reaction. I assume that we're discussing whether or not there was malice involved in the collision. Taking a step into the path of a guy who is running full sprint into you is not evidence of malice.

If they were publishing ""big names"" that I like, then I figured it was a good journal. That has rarely steered me wrong.

What is changing, however, is that many journals are just flat out stopping publications because of lack of funding. University presses are dying too. That naturally changes things. There are some online journals that are fairly well respected (and independent presses) now because they are taken up publishing when other journals have failed. Furthermore, a lot of us care about open access to our research and choose to NOT place articles in journals that will only be available via subscription for 1-2 years, and only behind a paywall after. (This varies, of course, and I have had some very good advice to rewrite the terms of publication contracts with my editors so that I retain some rights to the article--including the right to put a pdf on my own personal website.

Ways I have seen Feminists skew the ""wage gap"" in the old way of figures lie and liars figure. 

Life time earnings - Jack and Jane start at the same job with the same education , they both work for Ten years and then Jane stops to have a baby,  ---- Jake has a baby too and works harder to provide for his family. ----Jane might come back from maternity leave or might not , but if she does  then she is gone again with her second child.  ----Jake just keeps plugging away trying for the promotion to provide for his family. Jane comes back on a part-time basis mad that Jack got the promotion . Jack gets another promotion for his hard work, Jane is passed over since she is part-time and they need a full time person. Jack is made CEO for his hard work , Jane gets a promotion too but is still bitter. Both 65 -- Jack is made a member of the board for all his hardwork over the years . Jane retires. 

* Jack earned more because he did not take 16 years off and he worked to get promoted and became CEO then a Board member.

* Jane thinks Jake earned more over his life because of ""The Patriarchy""  and he was promoted because of ""The Patriarchy""  and because there is so many Male CEOs and Board Members is The Proof !! of the Patriarchy.

Scary thing I have seen is the Feminists trying to force companies to appoint woman to boards and have more CEOs by way of the Ontario Teachers pension Fund and the Ontario Securities Commission of not investing or not being listed unless they have 50% women

Find the closest object you can to the width of the gab between the pins (that isn't larger than the gap), and very carefully run it down between the pins in straight lines to finely adjust the angle of the pins so that they're straight. Look to make sure all pins are intact and try again. If it's not working - apply gentle heat. If you have an oven that does temperatures accurately, run it at 160c, for 10 minutes or so with the pins pointing upwards and the CPU laying on something that won't melt like parchment paper. If it doesn't work, up the temperature a little and try again. **Don't go over 200c.** Potentially you can try going over it with a hairdryer for a while, from a large enough distance to evenly heat the CPU without getting too crazy with it. Holding your hand next to it should become painful after a few seconds - if you see anything visible happen, stop. Do that for a few minutes. Check it and repeat. The hairdryer/heat gun version is a lot more difficult to get working, though. And don't forget to let it cool after heating."

I love seeing my rank on PSN Profiles climbing higher and seeing the Platinum Trophies stack up as I finish game after game. It's a reminder that I **CAN** do things, things that not many other people have managed. 

I also do the same with making my let's plays; it really gives me a confidence boost to know that people found me interesting enough for me to reach 2 million views. Knowing that I reached so many people even after I was written off by doctors and society (I've been off work sick since 2010) proves that I do have a value to the world, even if not to employers.

- The styling of the beard and hair. 
- Some might not like this tight a crop, but I think it works.
- I like the colors,  though he looks slightly too red, but that just might be my work-monitor.

What can be improved upon:

- The focus is very slightly off to the front. It's not a huge deal, but it is noticable.
- I wouldn't used this lighting set-up. It's a more feminine setup, and I think guys in general looks better with a bit harsher light. (Check out short lighting, loop lighting, closed loop lighting)

The motion is fluid enough to assume it's slowed down only to 24fps, not less. 300fps roughly gains 12.5x slowdown. The video had 11min length, and it's from a train passing Shinjuku. How long does it take the train to pass? Definitely not a minute, more like 5 - 10 s.

Makes a slowdown of 100x or 2400fps, not possible with a 7D or any other non-industrial device. 100x slowdown also fits the 'frozen' people, there is no movement whatsoever. 12.5x would show at least a little movement.

Concentration isn't a requirement to use your powers, but using your powers while still paying attention to your surroundings isn't exactly going to be like breathing. I imagine it like reading a book or watching a movie while trying to run. Not impossible but not very practical. I doubt you'd be able to simple read the minds of people without thinking about what you're doing, especially if you're actually going into their minds and trying to pull out specific memories.

&gt;It would depend on the person. Since the bullet was a part of the gun, and most criminals value their guns (and the bullet's core role in them), I imagine it would have some value to most.

That seems like a stretch to me. Not impossible but highly unlikely. I mean how much worth does a used bullet have? Most people don't collect their bullets after they used them. If I had a slingshot and shot a pebble, that pebble doesn't wouldn't mean anything special to me.

I'm in a technical university doing an engineering course, so although I hang out with a girl or two now and then, it has been a while since I've actually sat down for dinner with a large group of girls. 

What surprised me most was the gossiping. In our group we gossip. ""Hey, did you hear __ got syphilis?"". ""Haha, yeah, hilarious. Hope __ didn't get it from her"". And then we move on to other stuff. The girls would really delve into her personality to determine why she was such a slut. 

I also had a girl from my study recently join, and when I asked about how she was doing one of the girls rolled her eyes and said ""Oh, THAT girl"". Two weeks later I saw them chatting while having a beer.

radeky,nfl,1390379402.0,"You can put your hands in between a receiver and the ball so long as you don't touch the receiver before the ball gets there.

Watch corners more.  Most of them don't track balls in the air the same way receivers do.  Either they aren't taught how, or they're focused too much on keeping up with the receiver to turn their head around, etc.

Also, good receivers are extremely good at not looking back for the ball until the last possible second, giving the corner very little reaction time.

Particularly this is true for Go routes on man coverage.  Which is why QBs will take that shot frequently, because the risk of it being picked is fairly low."

The only other alternative I have found is that I hear a kid ask ""mummy, why does that girl have sticks?"" and the parent says ""Because she hurt her leg and she needs those until it gets better"". I hate that, it teaches the kid two wrong things, its teaching the kid that its ok to talk about someone's body and abilities behind their back, and it reinforces the idea of Disability binarism, where you are either able or unable, broken or fixed. Sometimes kids need to be told ""that's how she was born"" or ""something bad happened and that's how it will be forever now"" 

Sure some kids are too young to understand, But if they are old enough to ask the question they are generally old enough for a truthful answer.

If someone does ask me what's wrong, they get one of two answers, the truth, simplified for their age group, or a simple ""sorry, its personal"" if I don't want to talk about it.

Its so hard though, because lots of people don't like being asked, so I can't just go around telling able people to ask and disabled people to share. But personally I like answering because ignorance goes hand in hand with prejudice, and I'd rather people get their information from the source."

radeky,Seahawks,1390380178.0,"The two things I'm aware of specifically are:

* Sherman believes Harbaugh did not do enough/said negative things about Sherman that lowered his draft stock.

* Sherman got a 1 game suspension for a fight that happened in practice.  The other player did not have a suspension.  Then Sherman got dropped down the depth chart at WR (from this and an injury), so he switched to CB where the defense was handled by a different coach.

My information comes from interviews with Sherman, so take it with a grain of salt.  But it wouldn't surprise me if Harbaugh suspended Sherman for the fight, and took offense to the way Sherman handled the suspension, bumped him down the depth chart and wrote off the player.  Sherman then switches to CB to get more playing time, does well but Harbaugh retains that initial impression of Sherman, speaks poorly of him prior to the draft, etc.

I think at this point its (mostly) in Sherman's head.  Whether it was real before or not, there was an interview with Harbaugh after the first game this year?  Or last one last year, can't recall (it was a hawks home game) where Sherman tried to get Harbaugh's attention after the game and couldn't.  Sherman seemed a little offended by this, but Harbaugh seemed pretty honest in his ""I didn't notice him until after he had slapped me on the ass, and was already running away""."

silverionmox,changemyview,1390380438.0,"&gt; Can't see the problem, do we need to compensate for all the ailments in the world to get started with the main ones? 

You're concentrating on covering a single symptom rather than addressing the root causes. If you objectify the selection process, then you'll avoid *every possible kind* of discrimination now and in the future. It's the difference between learning to keep track of your calories vs. banning one specific type of candy. The first is much more effective than the latter to combat obesity.

&gt;How does it reinforce and justify it? 

By making selection based on race a normal practice. By necessitating the continuing practice of existing discrimination in order not to be disadvantaged.

&gt;education is the main wealth generator in the long term

Then why not give everyone access instead of selecting?

&gt;by having a diverse class you reduce the prejudice anyone could carry into it

Is this some far fetched argument you produced out of some cavity for the sake of it or are you basing this on some research, statistic or real social phenomenon? Sounds like the former.

&gt;you also send a sign to the people outside that segregation is not to be tolerated. 

There's no segregation. There are no legal barriers to entry for non-whites, it's just a socio-economical phenomeon.

&gt;No, it's giving a farm to the poor. Education is not a product or a service, it's an investment.

It's like giving alms to the poor because it gives a nice visible result to feel good about, but doesn't address the causes of poverty.

Again, if education is an investment, why not give it to everyone?

&gt;Can't wait for that to happen. Fortunately it's easy to adjust affirmative action every year to clear statistics.

When someone suggests to tone it down you'll just call him a retrograde conservative. Administrative adjustment works slowly. Have people dialed back the affirmative action for women now that they outnumber men in higher education? Far from it."

We haven't seen any of their policies on what they plan to do when they get into government yet, we haven't seen them do anything as opposition really (it's been terribly quiet down there tbh) we also, unfortunately, haven't seen what the Murdoch papers are going to say / do when the next election roles around.  

So to Bill Shorten, I say, I want you to be the next Prime Minster, more so then Abbott, but prove to me (and every other Aussie voter) that you are the best people for the job.

this comparison is applicable to clothes. the technical elements of clothes *are* objective. ie: a bigger jacket, longer hem, baggier pants, chunkier shoes or a tighter fit will offset/alter your proportions and silhouette in very definitive ways (relative to what you pair them with obviously). however, what proportions or fit is ""correct"" is not objective.

how colours interface with eachother is also objective- colour theory is a very real thing (this is one of the reasons i think people who say ""black is not versatile"" don't know what they're talking about). some colours are more seamless and harmonious, others are jarring and dissonant, some are washed out and muddy.. but again, while the technicalities are objective, there is no objective ""right"" colour combinations, as different ones can be used to different effect.

KingQajar,worldnews,1390381528.0,"The Justice and Construction Party is the wing of the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya. If Libya was farther along in setting up its democracy, then this incident would be a setback, but a major one. However, since the democracy is fragile, the removal of so many ministers from important positions leaves the government vulnerable and weak in many places. 

Libya cannot afford any less stability in government mainly because of two major things.

* Cyrenaica - The government of the Cyrenaica region has declared itself autonomous and is in control of major ports along their coast. Even though the autonomous government says it is still part of Libya, the Libyan central government does not recognize their authority. Therefore, a lot of ports are now not in use by outsiders.

* Gaddafi Loyalists - Even after Gaddafi died, a lot of his strong supporters still live on. The Libyan military has put down many small rebellions by Gaddafi-ist groups that still continue on to this day.

Overall, we'll have to wait and see. This mass resignation could have startling effects or very minor effects in the long run. Either way, there will be problems down the line for the government in general."

I guess it depends on what the service involves and the level of expertise the person doing the editing has. If the cost includes having photo's taken professionally, having them retouched then receiving quality prints. based on how much wedding photo's cost locally, I would expect $400-$500 for this kind of service, 20 hours of work.

However if I submitted my own photo, and received a digital copy, I wouldn't want to spend anything over $100.

If there were some kind of ""before and after"" package, where you get Glamour shots taken at your starting weight, an edited shot of what you might look like at your goal weight, and a voucher to get a third shot taken when you reach that weight, then $500 would be a great deal because that's how much 3 glamour shots would cost anyway."

I can't even remember the last time that someone posted a funny or insightful original thought on FB.  It's now all reposting articles, posting events, people promoting their own ventures/bands/what have you.  For me and those I know, FB has stopped being a place for friends to interact and connect, have fun and share some laughs, and has become an uber-serious news portal or an often abused avenue for people to self-promote.

Yes you're right, the law states that it's ""anti propaganda"" and is about teaching kids to respect and preserve the Russian traditions. But as we know, what the law says and what is enforced are different things.

We are all aware of the term perversion of the law. When a law is vague or outdated, such as the Computer Misuse Act- which criminalises things like ""Making, supplying or obtaining articles for use in computer misuse"" or more famously the computer fraud and abuse act used against Aaron Swartz, the law becomes not about the content so much as what it can be interpreted to mean.

In this case, both the content of the law and the changes to Russian society are offensive and damaging to the freedom of minorities within their borders. The law prevents any suggestion that homosexual and heterosexual relations are “socially equivalent” and imposes fines to anyone who may do so. 

When Dmitry Livanov, minister of education and science says ""We think every society has a certain set of traditions and restrictions, and everyone should understand those traditions and should respect not only the history of the society they live and work but also the restrictions that society imposes"", he uses history and tradition quite interchangeably. To use the United States as an example, there is a tradition there called Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is part of tradition as well as history. However there are parts of History that are not part of tradition. At the time, things like slavery or suppressed rights for women may have seemed like ""tradition"".

But I digress. Regardless of the justifications, regardless of what stories the minister of whatsit tells the effect of the law is most important. It has sparked movements such as ""occupy pedophilia"" where alleged gay men and women are forced to drink urine on camera, videos of which are then uploaded to the internet. There are videos of the same group luring LGBT teens on dating sites and then beating and torturing them, filming it all with the intention of outing them in their communities and schools.

Leaders of these groups say things like ""I think practically all gay men are pedophiles, once you've crossed over once, you can cross over again. Today he likes boys, and then it'll be children. They're not suitable for life in society."" ""If it was up to me, I'd kill them but the government doesn't allow that."". It has been reported that when some of the victims try to report the assaults, the police turn them away as soon as they find out they are gay. Many victims are driven to suicide, and understandably the rest are deeply traumatised and will likely be scared to speak openly for the rest of their lives.

So yeah, like you were saying it's only about prohibiting propaganda that promotes alternative lifestyles to minors and it's also not a big deal.

You even say it yourself- **alternative** lifestyles, not harmful or adverse lifestyles."

You and Rhys should read a bit about narcissists. I think you will find very much in there that you can relate to due to Rhys' mother. 
Sometimes it can help that the person infected by narcissism gets therapy and help, but sometimes you just have to cut them out until they understand whats going on and by them selves get the help they need. 
I have a huge amount of experience with these kinds of people, and even though I don't know you or Rhys or Rhys' mother, I highly recommend you read a bit about it. Finally I've come to peace with myself and realised that it wasn't my fault, everything in my past.

*If the Banterbury family existed in ASoIaF, no one would want to marry them. Each daughter produces daughters! So many daughters!*

Just so, Ahilac and Mordecai had 3 girls, [Andromeda, Hollie and Carie](http://i.imgur.com/zjrjaFz.png?1). Mordecai had a brief fling with local Appaloosa Plains crazy, Imogen Pelly (before he met Ahilac of course).  

Whilst Hollie and Carie died childless, under my strict control Andromeda set her sights on Jedidiah Bird. Four children were born unto them: the girls Nebula, Magellan and Altair; and the green-girl-who-became-a-pink-boy-because-I-was-sick-of-green-girls, Jim.

As I literally just mentioned, I had an abundance of green skinned alien girls. I tried my luck with Nebula. Self-made fairy Phillip Shelley became her mothers room-mate, and after being scorned by the lady of the house, set his sights on the daughter. Phillip and Nebula created a life and babbies together; being quick of the mark by producing twin girls: Athena and Venus. The first trueborn boy of the Banterbury/Shelley clan arrived in the twins teenage years: a lad named Centaurus.

This is currently where my game is at. Nebula and Phillip's children have aged up and out (the 4th tier on the tree). The alien twin Athena is in a loving marriage with her partner Shavonne and their adopted daughter, Andromeda Banterbury II. Venus followed in the footsteps of her great-grandfather, marrying and having 3 children with a late night green skinned gentleman caller. He has since cheated on her with her own brother Centaurus (scandal!!); leaving her to raise their 3 daughters: Artemis, and the twins Castille and Polly. She has forgiven the two lovesick men, but their parents never will. "

Another beginner here that's planning on a melomel: How exactly does this work? Does this mean that the fruit puree doesn't dissolve within the mead? And if you add fruit slices, wouldn't they just still be there at the time of racking and therefore also be 'lost'?

I also have another fruit related question: if you add the fruit in slices in primary and rack, would you move the slices to secondary? Or would the primary be all the time the mead comes into contact with the fruit? I understand that adding the fruit in just secondary instead of just primary would usually give a more fruitty flavor?

Edit: So say I wanted to use peaches and started off with fresh peaches, would you recommend I add them as slices, as puree, or as juice?

Thanks!"

I'm a cis man. I don't know firsthand what it is like to be a woman in this world, and telling feminists that I don't see these problems they're talking about would be stupid.

I also lost track of the point of this discussion branch, or just realized that your original point was conflict avoidance and seemed defensive when I wasn't even faulting women as a collective. I don't care if they choose to get married or not.

But I think for anyone implying/suggesting that somehow this oversupplied group of Chinese men are the ones primarily responsible for the predicament of these unfortunate but relatively affluent women, the onus is on the critic. 

I'm not sure if you're trying to promote that idea or not, because you're not being clear. If you're suggesting that patriarchy or at least the facet of fathers over daughters/male gerontocracy is involved in this particular matter, I wouldn't mind seeing the arguments as well as the data to see the degree/significance. Explicitly. None of this subtle, grey, and implied stuff that lurks in people's minds and plays/preys on people's innate prejudices.

I personally don't think that facet of patriarchy explains much of it (e.g. women born to single mothers actually tended to marry up more often due to socioeconomic pressures, not patriarchal ones; in fact, one of the ""sheng nu"" or [as TRP would put it] ""post-wall"" Chinese women I talked to on this matter lost her father to cancer when she was young - No patriarchal pressure there; still got married), but I'm interested and would not mind seeing arguments that say otherwise."

Cain the Father of Murder and his brother who was talking to Lucifer. Holy. Crap. I really want to see more of this guy even though it's fairly obvious he's just ready to die at this point. 


Anyone else think Dean made a horrible mistake accepting that Mark without knowing the cost? Anyone think he might be expected to kill Sam or something else just as unsavory that he'll want to *really* avoid doing and will make him want to get rid of the Mark? I'm hoping that's not it and it's more along the lines of him becoming immortal or developing some demon-ish qualities. Really unsettled by this turn of events, I don't see it ending well. When does it ever for the Winchesters? At the same time I like the potential and the shift from Sam to Dean. Poor Sam's been beat up enough this season.

IndignantChubbs,AskReddit,1390384463.0,"I can't answer that because the premise is flawed. Education itself is not measurable. You cannot quantify wisdom, creativity, maturity etc. You can measure parts of a system of education  -- student to teacher ratio, for example -- but you cannot measure the education itself. 

Putting that aside, level of academic achievement is a pretty standard measurement of educational level of a population. Having more per capita college graduates is conclusive evidence that our national population is more educated today, not less. And because the country has simultaneously become more unequal, this hypothesis is wrong."

    Soon she will feel that her nightmares are real.

    In the dark of the night she'll be tender [as in tender meat]
    Now she'll get it, I want to watch

The English version keeps alluding something bad's going to happen. The Swedish version flat out states she'll be murdered several times.

These odds I speak of include a lot of things, such as circumstances, personality, genetics, never being given a chance, ever to see what can be right or good. It's sad. And like I said I wish I could say that I think anyone can. I doo however believe that most people can or could. 

To your second question, absolutely. I'm extremely open about everything that happen to me. To the point where some people think I over share. But typically, those people who think that never experienced keeping something even remotely close to a miniscule portion of what I have experienced inside them. Never experienced the shame. 

When that police officer believed me, and gave me my way out, when someone *finally* believed me the relief and joy that rushed through me was overwhelming. And I made a promise to myself to never hide that again. When you tuck evil in the dark it grows and festers and twists you inside out. I don't want that. 

And so, I've gotten to a point where I not only accept what happened to me but recognize that everything that happened to me helped shaped me into the person I am today. And while  would never wish anything I experienced on anyone, I love the person I am and so I would never wish things were different, because than I would be different. 

There is definitely still some negative feelings. Some fear, hate, anger. But those are normal. What happened to me is a part of me. It helped make me and instead of keeping me broken I ed able to use it to be who I am today.

Also, I feel it necessary to say, while I did experience physical abuse, they never laid a hand on me. Almost wish they had, because the trauma physical abuse did healed with little to no consequences, but the other abuses. That has left deep scars. Emotional, verbal and psychological abuse worms its way into your very core, and it nettles and sticks around for a ling  time.

citadel_lewis,DebateReligion,1390385249.0,"&gt;&gt; Seeing as I specifically referred to Brian, I have no idea why you thought I was referring to you.

&gt;Uh, because you were and are replying to me? If it's not directed at me feel free to drop it.

&gt;---

&gt;&gt; That's a really convenient definition for you. 

&gt;You caught that I quoted you, right? Because I did. If you object to my response on the grounds of a poor definition, you really only have yourself to blame.

Sorry, I never defined privacy that way. I specifically referred to a sense of self. A sense of self is in no way the same thing as the concept of privacy. **You** defined a **private** mind that way, don't redefine what I have said.



&gt;&gt; Self-determination and privacy are separate issues. Let's use the one that Wikipedia uses, instead: ""the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves and thereby reveal themselves selectively.""

&gt;Really? You're really appealing to the exact wording of a Wiki definition? Alright then... I'll accept that this definition lines up with your ""a mind that is... experienced exclusively by you"". Note that this redefinition cuts out the ""controlled"" part you originally included, which means...

No, *you* included that part when you defined a private mind. I only defined the privacy from a Wikipedia quote. 


&gt;&gt; After all, if I take drugs and cause massive shifts in my personality by external means, I have in no way had my privacy violated. Just the same, if you use magnetic pulses to cause a change in my personality, my privacy has not been violated either.

&gt;Yep, right on time. You redefine your own criteria and then immediately continue on as if I should have been using that criteria all along. Both of these examples would violate the ""controlled... exclusively by you"" part of your definition. That they do not line up with this new version is, again, on you.

Again, **you** are the one redefining. "
TheLittleGoodWolf,sex,1390385251.0,"It's not a prerequisite for the job, in fact it rarely shines through much at all in the job. I have seen similar reactions from people about a friend of mine who is a farmer. This guy is wickedly intelligent and in many areas and people always say it's a shame that he's **just** a farmer because he could do so much more. Thing is that he's happy with what he does, he's happy living where he lives in the middle of nowhere. 

I know plenty of other people who do simple manual labor yet are also really intelligent. This also seems to surprise a lot of other people and that's fully understandable because it's not something that is displayed through work.

Today when forming an opinion about someone we usually ask what they do for a living. Our work has become a way in which we define ourselves and others. Because of this it's unsurprising to me that people don't really consider intelligence to be a part of porn-stars, because it's not often displayed.

&gt;And also, why do I feel that if porn stars were TRULY intelligent, they wouldn't be doing porn?

Because of the same reason that we think a prodigy in something should be pretty much obligated to use that skill as much as possible. Preferably through work so that the skill can benefit all. But what if the person doesn't want to do that? What if I was a genius at math but all I really wanted to do was drive a tractor and raise cattle?

Porn (and pretty much all sex related work) is considered really lowly work. It's getting up there but a lot of people still look down on it, I mean it's basically prostitution on film right? who would want to do that? (note the sarcasm in those questions) So since you would obviously consider work in porn as a last resort, and not something for someone TRULY intelligent because they could get other kinds of work. Just my theory though."

You're kidding. I am not going to bother arguing about biology, but why would you completely discount socioeconomic factors? It makes no logical/mathematical sense. 

I'm sure you at least believe men generally experience more positive occupational social mobility (more specifically, less likely to drop downwards), fair or not. You match that with the relative balance in overall social mobility between the sexes, and it's pretty obvious that women's marital social mobility comes naturally as a result of socioeconomic pressure. By transitivity, a general trend towards hypergamy (the upwards half of marital social mobility).

wildweeds,casualiama,1390386065.0,"well first of all, every state has different laws.  the state i lived in was pretty stringent.  they could only take out a max of 500 at a time and we used factors such as income and job stability to decide whether they got anywhere from 50 to 500 on that scale, in $50 increments.  the fee was also set by the state, $5 on every $50 borrowed.  and they could only take it for a certain period of time, extend it one time, and had legal ways to break it up into multiple payments- once in a certain period of months, and absolutely could only have one loan out within the state database in a day.  

all those protections helped, but yeah people still got hooked.  it was my job to sell them their loans as well as trying to get them to buy prepaid debit cards my company sold.  i never tried to do that unless i had the general manager in my store watching us, because i dont believe in upselling. 

though you're not supposed to suggest to a customer to stop taking the loans, of course anyone who wanted to id let them know the easiest way to step down- which was unfortunately to keep taking loans, fifty bucks less each time, until you can financially handle to go cold turkey.  that, or wait till tax time  and bow out with the extra money you have coming.  if you take loans, you likely get tax refunds instead of paying out.  

when i describe the job i half-jokingly say that my job was to take advantage of poor people, but they were doing it all to themselves, really.  we just offered a very regulated service, and oftentimes people really needed us in a pinch.  i was glad to be there for people in that kind of instance.  but it made me sad when they came back the second and third time.  what could have been a one time thing on their part became an addiction, and thats what gets them trapped.  because by the time you're taking five hundred out of your check to pay for a loan, you cant spare that money.  so you come back the next day to get a new loan for this payday, and sigh and hope you can fix it soon but you're too poor to worry about that right now..

we did often have scammers for checks, and loans sometimes rolled over and got put into collections for a while, and we had to call them.  we were supposed to push people for payments, but hey- im poor too.  i grew up poor and i get not having the money and you'll pay it when you do.  so id write good notes in the account that would help the person and tell them how they could keep themselves in good standing if they were interested, and just mark down that they weren't home or whatever otherwise.  unless they were rude in which case go fuck yourself.  

so yeah, my job was sort of shady by definition sometimes, but im not a corporate kind of person, im for the people not companies.  so i did what i could on my end, giving people the full info instead of talking points, and helping them get out of the loan system if they wanted it instead of suggesting to stay in it.  

in some states they do title loans as well as letting multiple loans be taken out or having ridiculous fees, but in the end its also the person's own fault- they know that taking these loans consistently will only do more damage, so if its possible to only do it once in an emergency that is what should be happening.  but people have less options when they're poor, and less training on financial matters, and maybe some apathy toward their future when their now is crashing in, so it happens.  the most i can say is regulation helps.  it keeps people from fucking themselves over or letting some company do it.  because honestly, my company only followed the rules it was told to, and it would likely have been just as predatory as some of the ones in more lax states if it could have.  

hope that was useful/interesting"

The reason this issue is of such importance is that Russia has been chosen to host an international event, something that should be given to countries that are taking steps forward, not backward.

Treatment of homosexuality in other countries is worse than in Russia sure, but we're not about to go giving the olympics to them. I read (in passing, I promise) a headline from buzzfeed stating that there are 76 countries in which anti-gay laws are as bad or worse than in Russia. And yes, we're allied with some of them. But this just further adds to my point- people feel that because liberties have been won for people in our own country, the battle is over. In reality, we shouldn't be proud that a country has made progress towards equality so much as we should be continuing to push for equality everywhere.

What should be done about Russia? Take away the olympics would be a start. Give them to a country that has shown progress, instead. Many countries in South America and Africa have shown great decline in poverty. Portugal has made great progress towards increasing public health.

And a whole bunch of other info on how they test things, why they bought certain drives, what their criteria is, and so on.

They did the filling in of the gaps, it just requires that you do more than just look at one of the charts they put together.  Charts are always a balancing game between readability and information density, and this one is a good overview chart.  It was also taken out of a very well-put-together blog post that clearly defines the context and who BlackBlaze is, OP should have linked to the blogpost instead of just a chart, but as mentioned, they did put it in the comments, but ""Oh shit I just got a Seagate"" and ""here's a prettier out-of-context chart from the already-supplied link"" got voted above it.  Thanks, everyone.

To address your specific points, since apparently you can't be bothered to read the article you're tearing apart:

The models did indeed vary, but even broken down by model, the best Seagate Drive had a higher failure rate than the worst of all the other drives.  The worst 7 drives were the 7 Seagate models they had data for, and the 1.5TB drives were especially problematic.  The rest of the drives were notably better, but still worse than the other brands.

They also had both Red and Green drives in the pool.  As noted, Green drives fared more poorly - and the Seagate Green drive was outstandingly poor, perhaps a ""death star"" drive, except that they only had 50 of them in the pool, so they didn't skew the numbers too much.

**TL;DR:** Read the fucking article before you go off on how terrible it is based on one chart.  They provided all the information you complained about not having and more, surveyed a wide array of drives, and yes, Seagate really was notably worse Hitachi and WD, across all 7 of the Seagate drives they tested."

Ukraine pushed their people too far, they don't hold the same levels of control over their population. If I had immigrated to Ukraine a little while back I would be in the streets.

There's two different approaches, America tries to suppress accountability by making people complacent, Ukraine tries to reduce accountability by using fear and violence. It's all situational, hence my original post.

What Calc or any other OSS spreadsheet needs is usable pivot functionality, flexible conditional formatting, easier data filtering options and so on. Calc still only has hi-contrast highlighting of cells which is straining your eyes if you work on a spreadsheet for hours.

kempff,whatisthisthing,1390387586.0,"It's called a sonometer (or sometimes incorrectly a monochord) and is used in teaching about sound, pitch/frequency, tension, harmony, and so on. The gadgets on the one end tell how much tension is in each wire; the greater the tension the higher the pitch, if the tension is quadrupled the pitch goes up an octave, etc. Also if you touch or fret the wires at small-whole-number ratios along their lengths you get the notes of the musical scale; touch the wire in the center (that is, 1/2 the way) and you will get a note an octave higher; 2/3 of the way and you get a major-fifth; and so on. That's what the underlying centimeter-rulers are for measuring.

You can also show what the difference is between Pythagorean and Well-Temperament tuning schemes. It's subtle but unless you see it for yourself it's hard to understand.

And some models instead of using those tension-gadgets they have pulleys so you can dangle known weights on the ends of the strings to create the corresponding tensions.

I know we all rail against the government and how shitty they are. And you'll get no dispute from me. But we aren't in death camps, dissenting opinions aren't being forcibly silenced, we still have the right to vote (though that may feel helpless at times), and by and large we are all safe on a day to day basis.

silverionmox,polandball,1390388285.0,"&gt;  bet that was a great comfort to the millions dead, widowed and orphaned.

The point is that ""the horror that Belgium created in the Congo - a non-stop genocide that is still going on"" is wrong on two counts: Belgium didn't create the mess, it inherited it - and cleaned it up somewhat.

&gt;Oh I see that was the issue. I'd always thought it was the immediate coup attempt by belgium mining interests and the CIA. Within twelve weeks, Lumumba's government was deposed in a coup during the Congo Crisis. The main reason why he was ousted from power was his opposition to Belgian-backed secession of the mineral-rich Katanga province

And do you think provinces left and right threatening with seccession is the sign of a well-run country? The crisis wasn't caused by Belgian intervention. In fact, the Belgians, in marked contrast with eg. the French in Algeria or the Dutch in Indonesia, just gave them independence when they couldn't wait any longer. 
It was only when the remaining Belgians were starting to be raped and killed that intervention happened.

&gt;Of course Belgians like to think that all the issues arose from King Leopold that is of course not true. 

The situation of the population improved markedly after it was taken out of Leopolds' hands and put under Belgian rule. It then deteriorated again when Belgian rule ended.

&gt;The Belgian genocide in the congo happened in the 20th century, millions of human beings were butchered or worked to death by the Belgians.

Mostly in the 19th century, and for a large part by the motley crew of Westerners that Leopold employed to do his dirty work, among which all kinds of nationalities, French, British, American,...

&gt;over half a century later of terrible exploitation - the Belgians were talking about 30 year plans for independence. Having stolen untold wealth under arguably the worlds worst example of colonialism you point to literacy rates, come on.

I'm sorry that undisputably positive elements contradict your black-and-white worldview, and gives you cognitive dissonance and headaches. It's not my problem that you don't know Congolese colonial history well enough to see any change between the early exploration by Stanley et allii and independence.

&gt;This is like on the one hand Mussolini executed people he didn't like in their beds killed hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians, Slavs and Italian dissidents but on the other hand the trains were punctual.

No, it's like saying Mussolini killed scores of people, but things improved after he was deposed, even though the government was still populated by Italians.

&gt;the Belgians were talking about 30 year plans for independence.

And who got what they wanted? And what was the result?"

crankypants15,AskMen,1390388977.0,"&gt; but the fact that he has never said it outside intercourse time has me concerned that maybe it is just lust or heat of the moment thing?

Um, not necessarily. Sex can be very intimate for many guys (whether they understand that, admit it out loud, or not), and sex can be the doorway to intimacy. And some guys don't really have strong emotions outside of sex. That doesn't mean he's using you. Educate yourself about male sexuality instead of assuming things. 

It also could be, he's just comfortable saying it during sex. Or he may not know how you feel about the ""L"" word, so he could use passion as plausible denial. 

And never, ever judge someone based on what you would do. 
That's just asking for fail. 

&gt; question is whether I should be concerned about the circumstances during which it gets said,

No. Educate, don't assume. 
Unfortunately I don't have any links about male sexuality and emotions relevant to this. But I am a guy, and I went through a similar phase. Some girls really do freak out when the guy says the ""L"" word.

reactivepixel,orlando,1390389100.0,"Rob and Mitchell are a father / son combo that restore old bikes.

They take a long time (3 weeks for mine due to weather) and want to give you a 'custom' paint job. 

Their process is you go to their place in Apopka, sort through all their garage full of run-down frames and choose the style you like and they coach you on the frame size that best fits your body. Then pay upfront (I want very happy about that, but decided to try it out).

When picking it up they fine tune it for your body and you're on your way with a lifetime guarantee on all parts that are not rubber and free labor if something needs fixed / replaced.

Their prices fixed based upon what kind of bike you want, and then they hook you up with some nice parts. For my road bike I think I payed $200.

Rob was bragging about one of the parts he gave me being worth more than I payed, I lol'd and thought he was just being a salesman but once on a trip I banged up a rim and had to go to a bike shop to fix it and they commented me on the nice hardware and called out the specific piece he bragged about... So there's that.

2 years in on my bike and ~1500 miles and I've only needed to change out bar tape. Great bike, was my daily (7 mile) rider to work.

Pro tip: opt for solid colors, Rob is a true artist who wants to find inspiration from you for the paint work... being a Centurion and having a sweet 70's emblem on the bike I informed him about Battle Star Galactica and opted for a 'robot' themed paint job. I got a spray paint job that looked more like black with blue / grey clouds... about as far from robot as you can imagine. I was less than happy about that, but I wan't buying for the awesome paint work.

I highly recommend them despite my comments about the paint work. They only advertise through Craig's list. Here is a listing with their # http://orlando.craigslist.org/bid/4294819391.html

It's her right to lie in that situation, and it's your right to leave.

&gt; ""I don't care.""

Too alpha by half, son.

The big nasty alpha buffalo through beast game isn't really necessary once you have her isolated. At that point she's offering trust, and trust building is where the game is at. You're in middle game and proceeding toward end game. At this point, the question boils down to ""what makes her comfortable with where this might be going?""

I promise, saying ""I don't care"" is not helpful in that context.

 - - -

I'll tell ya the truth . . . this is a situation where presenting as a nurturing big brother and shelving the alpha wannabe bullshit would have been supremely advantageous.

I'm a believer that most women basically want a guy who can be a non-judgmental big brother with benefits. When you get into dealing with abuse victims, this multiplies several fold.

Where abuse victims can be tricky as sexual partners is that the basic female desire for a dominant male sexual partner doesn't disappear. In fact, it can be amplified. The thing is, you have to understand that there's a big gap in her experience between the desire to be with a dominant male and the fear of being exploited by a creep.

If you're actually interested in this type of relationship, you're going to invest time and you're going to commit to helping her bridge that gap. On the flip side, abuse victims can be very committed and caring sexual partners that often allow you some room to be tender and vulnerable in a beta kinda way, especially if you can deliver the goods in the sack while also presenting as a supportive big brother elsewhere in their lives."

P.S. That's the whole point of democracy. If you were to live in Communism you would probably get straight employment in the field (even if government was going into more debt just to create it). However, it's possible you wouldn't be allowed to do that course at all, as government would probably regulate numbers of applicants to possible job possibilities. Free market isn't always fair - communism certainly either (even though in principles it's great)."

My-Name-Is-Awkward,emetophobia,1390389781.0,"Yes! Sometimes I get anxiety when I get nauseous no matter where I am, but most of the time I don't think throwing up would be all that bad if I was home alone. Or even in a public toilet. For me it's more of fearing a situation where I couldn't make a discreet exit if it were to happen.

Logically, I know people would only be disgusted (a normal evolutionary reaction, I think), but since it's happened to all of us they wouldn't think much else of it.

Secondly, for me, there's the fear of losing control. I have a slight fear of losing my mind (up to the point I might hurt people), so I fear having no control over vomiting. I could take a spoonful of a vomiting inducing medicine and it probably wouldn't faze me much, since I'd be completely prepared for it. Obviously it'd be uncomfortable, but that's about it.

And even though I know it shouldn't be possible to just start suddenly spewing, there's at least some nausea before it which warns you, these situations still give me anxiety."

kicker7955,europe,1390389943.0,"&gt;However, this policy in itself is no guarantor of increased or improved competition.

What is guaranteed is that if no change is implemented the concentration will only increase, and the arguments for to big to fail are solidified. 

&gt;Firstly, capping a good bank that is seen as delivering an excellent service with fair fees is actually denying a new generation of would be bank customers the opportunity to open banking facilities according to their choice.

Not capping them will deny opportunities for any new financial service company to enter the market, make it more resilient and develop new services. We are talking about financial services where you don't have large overheads.

 &gt;One has to ask how can we trust the Labour Party when they oversaw the appointment of a former Labour Councillor,  Paul Flowers as Co-Op Bank Chairman only for him to be engulfed in a drugs scandal and exposed for a total lack  of  any banking knowledge. 

Does that mean labor should be banned from the ballot? or that conservatives are immune to it? also why use a political issue to argue for a economical policy, this kinda starts to look like propaganda. Oh silly me, the article is from Forbes.com the news source that sees greed as admirable and poverty as a side effect of social policy and the lack of ambition.

&gt;The Labour Government of Gordon Brown sank GBP45.2Bn (USD72.3Bn) into RBS and yet the demand that it sell off branches means its value is just GBP35Bn (USD56Bn).

the old, ""if we don't stop them from delapidating we won't get our money back"" argument. A classic of being to caught up in the trees to see the forest. Politicians today are so scared of change and political rhetoric that they happily sacrifice macroeconomic sanity for the sake of the state budget.

&gt;Given the rise of on-line or internet banking many of the leading five UK clearing banks have divested or shut branches anyway…in the on-line age the need for a physical branch is rapidly losing its significance.

But somehow traditional companies still dominate online and are threatened by any measure that would limit their real life oligopoly.This argument is purely emotional, along the lines, of ""with the *new internets* and *.coms* making all the new money let the old guy enjoy his old fashioned ways, while they still can.""

&gt; it would be a better step if instead of playing to the crowd with fine sounding one liners or five second slogans an effort was made to think about the debate over a full hour.

great advice, now the author should replace ""crowd"" with ""my readers"" and take it himself.

&gt;BTE  block potential entrants from freely entering a market profitably. They protect the market share of the incumbent firms so allowing the preservation of  supernormal or monopoly profits in the long run. In short the market is less contestable.

Something true, but as any entrepreneur can tell you barriers of entry(you don't need an acronym for it, only if you want to be pretentious) are just the start and its effects are limited over medium term, some would argue that they are filter against weak business models with insufficient liquidity and prevent them from entering and overcrowding the bottom end of the market with unsustainable options, but that is another debate. 

What is not debatable is that a saturated, highly regulated market is a much bigger hurdle for new companies. You could deregulate it, but that would just make the industry more dangerous as i'ts capacity to self regulate are have been proven to be severely lacking and there is no guarantee that the oligopoly won't develop internal mechanism to prevent up-and-comers for threatening their position. Option 2 is limit saturation, it has its side effects but if you consider the goal: the health of the market in the long term -  it is the best option.

&gt;This is a hot political potato that is going to be given plenty more cooking time as the election … just 16 months away draws near.

No it isn't a political issue, only with the dawn of neo conservatives being advocated of ""save the corporation, save the country"" has the economy become a pseudopolitical subject, people should not be put into this false dichotomy of economic freedom or social responsibility, because these to are linked(you can't sustainably fund social issues without the first and a system without social measures is illegitimate politically), and any form of debate on these pseudo subjects just masks how lobbied conservative measures are and how populist liberal measures are."

Any future spinoffs that take place will probably use an unofficial canon - simply because they have to make some assumptions to make the world contiguous.

Interestingly, the Dragon Age Origins unofficial canon actually makes a great deal of sense if you look at it carefully, no companions are killed or particularly ruthless options taken. I imagine this tradition will continue, with Hawke being a relatively passive force in Kirkwall that ultimately opposes Meredith without anyone stating what side Hawke was actually on."

There are lots of happy short people too. I'm not sure i understand your point. 

&gt;while I don't know of any against short people..

Which institutions in the US discriminate against women? Those would be Civil Rights violations. As far as institutional discrimination against short people, you have some municipalities which still have arbitrary height requirements for civil servants jobs, plus airlines for flight attendants, some Fraternities, sperm banks, some dating sites (the ones that done even allow you to join if you don't meet a height requirement), movie studios, and those are just a few. Generally, short men (as a group) face resistance from the bedroom to the boardroom and across all facets of society. 

&gt;What good is encouraging others to ""feel good""? Well, you get happier people, for starters. I'd consider that a top priority.

I guess I'm old fashioned. I prefer a better and more just society to happiness for the sake of happiness. You should totally read this philosophical short story.

Nowadays, there are many thousand on quickmeme and other meme websites. I was a memer back before memegenerator was created (the first meme website) and I had to make them with MS Powerpoint or Paint. Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals[1] [1] was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny.

emk2203,Ubuntu,1390391113.0,"Go to [pxcalc](http://pxcalc.com/) and calculate the dpi you should have. Now, use 

    xrandr | grep -w connected 

to see what the system *thinks* your monitor size is.

Check your initial values: 

    xdpyinfo | grep dots 
    xrdb -query | grep dpi 
    cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep DPI

In your situation, I think 150% magnification would look fine, but I always liked small fonts and icons, your mileage may vary.

Check it out via

    xrandr --dpi 144x144

and vary according to preference. This assumes you started at 96dpi.


With the editor of your choice (I use vi), open 

    /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf 
and add a parameter under [SeatDefaults] section:

    [SeatDefaults]
    xserver-command=X -dpi [150% of the dpi reported]

--&gt; so, starting at 96, you would need for 150%*96dpi = 144dpi:

    xserver-command=X -dpi 144
   
Restart your computer or restart X. Now 

    xdpyinfo | grep dots 

will report 144x144 dots and 

    cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep DPI 

will also show the desired setting.

In GNOME3, DPI setting is hardcoded to 96 and cannot be changed directly, but the text can be scaled instead. Calculate the desired multiplier: 150% makes a multiplier of 1.5. Now run the command (or use dconf if you prefer):

    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface text-scaling-factor 1.5

Changes will be applied immediately and xrdb will also be updated on the fly. 

    xrdb -query | grep dpi 
will report the desired Xft.dpi: 144.

Now DPI is correctly set for the monitor."

I would just scout around one day that you have some spare time and ask around the different places that look like 24 hour parking lots. Ask the employees what the policies are and what not.

Worst case scenario, just either get a ride there and take a taxi home or take public transport there and taxi back home. If you REALLY don't care about cab faire, just take a cab to and fro.

As someone that got a DUI and took 3 years to fix and a year with a suspended license, I would really not recommend you getting into any situation that you may get a DUI. The cops are really hard on DUI arrestees and so are the judges.

About Stoya, I like her as a porn actress because I think she's good at it and I love how she looks. She seems like a good person outside of that too which is nice and anyone who can make some more than reasonable points about sex and society in general has my respect. There is some novelty in it because of her occupation though but I have no problem with that.

That was a great movie! And I dislike musicals in general. 

&gt; I also should have her powers. Her powers and **her dress.**

Can you imagine the bottom of that dress getting all crusty with mud and snow? It's basically sweeping the floor all freakin' day long.

&gt; So if you want to buy a car, and your wife wants to buy a pony, with the household income, the person with the power is the person who gets a new mode of transport.

You're assuming one person in a marriage has more power, and your assumption does not apply to all marriages. I don't do marriage like that. We combine incomes and if a person needs a new car, we look into what we can afford and *what is best for us as a family.*

Other than that, no, his ideas are not in the best interest of the city.  He divided the city into the average Joe suburbs and elitist downtowners.

Example 1 - All LRTs are streetcars and replacing the Scarborough RT with a LRT will rip up roads and cause more gridlock.  If he knew anything about the SRT he would know it runs in it's own right of way completely away from, and above, the roads.  
Example 2 - The relief line shouldn't be built because downtown has enough subways.

Kopfi,leagueoflegends,1390391598.0,"The lore and the creative side is definitely covered. I would play it. But i don't know about the gameplay.

PvE? PvP? Of course you can make simple ""kill XX porous and return their ripped out tongues to me"" quests. But are there any big PvE enemies in the LoL Lore? Like WoW had Archimond, Illidan, Onyxia, Arthas etc. 

Do you play a certain champion which is based on a role? Or phrased differently, can you pick one of the 117 champions and play them as if you are in a MMORPG? This would require A SHIT TON of work. Since a good balanced MMORPG would need more than 4 abilities on each character. Which would mean you need thousands of abilities, that all are customized on each champion and yet is balanced.
Or do you play a human like Champion that regarding its role &amp; race has some special abilities? (E.g. Yordle Tank. Special ability: Curse of the sad mummy)

Would PvE be instanced as well? For how many players? 
Would PvP be like Capture the flag/Dominion? 
What about E-sports? Is the LoL MMORPG Free2play? I do not think Riot would spend so much money into a MMORPG with only macro transactions. 

Imagine: Summoners Rift, Twisted Treeline, Dominion, Howling Abyss. There is so much incredible Detail in the environment even though the gameplay in a moba is more important. It would require AGES to develop the whole world of LoL as an open world which satisfies the RIOT art standard. 

TL;DR: I would love the idea, but since it would require too much time to balance and create the world and it would be difficult to establish an E-sport scene I doubt it would be worth for Riot to spend tons of money into development"

1-2 tsp minced garlic depending on your love of it

1 heaped tbs tomato paste

1 tin (400mL) condensed tomato soup

1 tin diced tomatoes

1 tsp basil (dried or fresh and diced)

Olive oil for cooking.


Brown meat in a pot then remove the meat and set aside. In the pot place the diced onion and cook until soft, add the garlic and stir in. Add the tomato paste, stir in and cook for about a minute. Add in the tomato soup and diced tomatoes, the basil and any other herbs you want in (oregano for example). Stir as it heats, once it starts bubbling put the meat back in, stir a bit more.

In the middle of the spectrum you have your middle class Americans - sleeping in a nice warm house, 40 hour a week job, got a car, get home, turn on tv, get fed advertisements and product placement more concerned with owning something nice than learning about what is going on. If/ when they see the news it's probably a news network which suits them and their political allegiances - news rarely reports the real situation, it's a tool of political influence pure and simple.

Personally I don't have anything (fortunately) that I can relate to as I am a white male of no religious background, no poor background nor any rich background. I'm that middle ground of, for lack of a better word, untouchable when it comes to racism/hate crimes. But fortunately it means I can take any dig at my and turn the other cheek as there is nothing that can offend me [that isn't something I can personally do to change I.E not about my personality or tastes]. I hope that doesn't sound to ""self-entitled arrogant white guy"". 
But yeah, the co-owner, I would've thought it'd just be a ""WTF are your players doing that for, sort it out or we're done"" not a single incident (at this club [I think]) and they're pulling out. Given the sources you just provided to do with his partnerships, I would say it's very hypocritical that you support those who hate the ""Jooz muzzlums and emergrants"" because they killed Diana and made the weather bad. 

And in relation to WBA's position man, think of yourselves in Cardiffs shoes. Cardiff aren't a big brand in the Prem, they're currently in their first season. You're like Sunderland and Norwich. You're not expected to win the league by any means but you're not necessarily expected to be playing Championship football regularly. You've hunkered down and unfortunately you may think you're fighting for survival, which you probably are, but it's when your team and fans start thinking like that you may find your morale slipping thus becoming the new Rovers and dropping down after X amount of semi-successful and successful seasons in the top flight. 

Support your team man, make sure your fans stay loyal. Not to the racist player, but to the badge they're wearing on their chest and the ground they play in week after week. Unfortunately my teams fans aren't quite as loyal. They're dedicated, but not loyal in support."

If he built a server with the same CPU/APU as in his gaming rig, and used both machines equally (for media streaming), and they were on 24/7, you'd probably see similar power consumption. Now, add on the power consumption of playing games on the machine. The gaming rig will consume more power.

In the end, having two machines probably would increase his bill by a little bit per year. But honestly, unless he plans to not play games on his gaming rig, while people are in another room watching movies, at all, then having a dedicated NAS solution hooked up to his network isn't a bad idea.

Currently, in the upstairs apartment of the house I live in, my friend has two TVs, both of which have a Zotac Zbox with XBMC on it. Those boxes are both connected to the home network, so it can access his server. Both TVs can pull the same file at the same time. The only time we've had problems with slight hiccuping is when we've been having network problems. As long as the computer is powerful enough, it should be fine.

The thing is that if I'm not interested in doing anything, I won't, and even when I'm feeling that itch, I don't want to do anything.

Personally, I really like talking to new people as long as the conversation doesn't awkwardly stagnate. On the other hand, when I'm on the train or the bus for example, I'm expecting to have the length of the journey to sit and think about stuff, listen to music, read, play on my 3DS and generally not have to exert the effort to interact with people. A little slice of quiet me-time. If someone starts talking to me I immediately think ""There goes my peaceful journey..."" but that doesn't mean I won't actually end up enjoying the conversation. It's more that I had expected the journey to be rather different, and I guess mentally prepared myself for that, only to have it upturned in an instant by some random stranger with no regard for my plans and expectations.

This ofc will mean they will use big words others might not know. It is not a sign that they are fishing for a diagnosis they dont have, ofc it might be in some cases (always bad fish in the sea) so it takes several appointments to treat people. Never ever treat someone like they are the bad fish! Anyway what im trying to say is that you knowing those words and doing the research is completely normal and he had no right to treat you like that.

Lizington,melbourne,1390392792.0,"There is so much wrong in this thread. OP,  start your renting life off on the right foot by getting the right info. The Victorian regulator for residential tenancy is Consumer Affairs Victoria, www.consumer.vic.gov.au 

If you like to read, go to the legislation section of the website and download the Residential Tenancies Act. It is a surprisingly simple Act, very little stupid legal jargon. Use ctrl+f to find things (you'll notice there is jack shit about pets, literally nothing) AND THEN, check your understanding of your rights by calling the ""tenants union"". 

If you don't want to read it just check out the unions factsheets linked elsewhere in this thread. 

Rent must be calculated daily, there are rules about how far in advance you can be required to keep and you absolutely cannot be legally evicted for having a pet. You may be up for a breach of contract of you signed/agreed not to, but it's not a breach of your obligation as a tenant under the act. You can however get in shit for lying on your application (or maybe that's only if your landlord is the office of housing...) "

Sometimes also with intention but most of the time because of pure emotion. i dont think it was ok for tots to go to the Calgary locker because that was outside the game but intentionaly injuring another player is punished for a long time now. players get suspended all the time for that. so would you like it more if every player from calgary got the fine ? i wouldnt like it.

People don't really need their hand held about last hitting and using skills.  They need help with the large collection of incredibly confusing items.

I've lived just west of Polaris since before it came into existence - it was all farmland when we moved here.  Now there are over 100 restaurants and more coming.  Where you're looking is a little to the west (so THAT'S what they're building there! I thought it was office space).  As maximae said it's a big mall and a lot of retail (love Costco).  You do need to be alert in the Polaris/Old State intersection.

Sure, there's traffic at rush hour, but I zoom down Polaris and onto 71 south during rush hour all the time with little to no issues at all.  The other side (west) of 71 has a bottleneck due to some traffic signals too close, and while perception is that it's a 'nightmare', reality is it's literally 1-4 minutes getting through the clogged side (not where you're thinking of living) most rush hours -- I track my travel times every day using Waze.

Given that the board is modular (and will change every game) and the variety of things you can do with the dice, plus the potential for expansions... I suspect it'll have some good replay value. I've preordered it, so I can comment on that more when I've had a chance to play a few times."

TLDR: I very much appreciate your specific feedback and I agree with you that some things have been glazed over that should/will be addressed in detail soon.


**-**

Thank you for the specific feedback, I agree that there are definitely a lot of things that I haven't gone into detail about while still implementing those things in our programs at the same time which could be jarring for people.  I've recognized the frustration that this may cause myself which is why I've decided to make a few videos which specifically are focused on one key topic, such as the latest Episode 4 which is devoted entirely to methods.

I rewatch my videos all the time to find things I'd like to improve on and I agree that some of the stuff we've been doing deserves to be explained further in-depth.  However, I do not regret creating the first three episodes the way I did since I think they accomplished what I set out to, which is to show people that it *is* possible to make a functional program that *does* something with very little programming knowledge.  I wanted to expose people to some of the key components of any program or game such as variables, printing to the console, loops and if statements and imagined that those tools alone would allow people to create a lot of cool things on their own time in between videos.

Moving forward into more complex programs *will* require a more detailed explanation of things that we have taken for granted thus far though such as public/private/static, methods, classes (next video) etc. which is why starting with 4 I'm going to cover some of these in their own video."

Kastoli,AskMen,1390393461.0,"&gt; it means your actions are racist

A word having a meaning, defines NOTHING about the person using the word.

A vast multitude of things can be found offensive by a myriad of different people, preemptively attempting to cull for vocabulary in an attempt to not offend people is just silly behavior.

You don't stop using the word 'Cracker' around white people because they might find it offensive, you don't stop using the word 'Slant' around asian people because they might find it offensive...

In the right context, anything, and everything is appropriate.

---

OP's situation sounds like a misunderstanding of context, either his friends are unable to assess that the situation in which they're in deems the word inappropriate, or they mis-asses the situation in a way which defines it as appropriate; or his girlfriend misunderstands the context in which the word is being using an is becoming unnecessarily offended.

My guess is a combination of 1 and 3."

tauntology,belgium,1390393487.0,"I'm not sure. I used to vote for Open Vld, because they combined a progressive ethical viewpoint with a free market economy. Now they seem to be moving away from both. 

Being part of this government was a big mistake. The government made mistake after mistake, increased taxes and reduced freedom. The 500 days of negotiation saw no new regulations or taxes and a small economic growth. All that with a government that was extremely limited in what it could do. It was a pretty good time and having a government with full powers is very clearly not an improvement. This government is worse than no government.

So, who to vote for? N-VA? I really don't like their ethics. They are conservatives. I kinda like their view on economics, but I know that this is what the party leaders believe, not necessarily what the members believe. Federalism or confederalism honestly doesn't matter to me, or most of the N-VA voters. 

Do I want to vote for ethical conservatives who will focus on state reforms that I don't care about? Maybe, if the economic platform is really good compared to that of the other parties. 

But I'm hoping for a really good economic platform from Open Vld. A big ""no pasaran"" that refuses to join any government that will increase taxes, reduce individual liberty. And with a clear focus of getting the economy going, at any price. 

At any price? Yes. Like you, I'm self employed. I could move to any of our neighbouring countries and get much more value for my tax money. Even if I had to pay the same amount, I would get more in return. (yes, even in France) And I wouldn't have to pay the same amount. Leaving the country would, at this point, be a wise decision. Only sentimental things keep me here. 

TL;DR Open Vld or N-VA, based on their economic program and the likelihood of them keeping that promise. "

UnholyDemigod,AskReddit,1390393541.0,"Was running through my girlfriend's brother's schoolyard to pick him up from the office. Ran over a gravel path and when I planted my left foot, it slid all the way to the right (I was going round a sharp left corner as I was running). I fell completely over as my legs slid out from under me, but I was able to plant my hand on the ground perfectly, to form a triangle. Because of the way I was turning around the corner, my legs actually swung in a counter-clockwise arc. I managed to push upwards with my arm, and the inertia from my legs swinging someone helped, and I was able to throw myself back up onto my feet and keep running as if nothing had happened.

Another time, I went to the snow (snow is a destination in Australia). I went snowboarding for the first time, and after I'd gotten a bit used to it, I started going up to the top of the hill and sliding all the way down as fast as I could. One of those times, a little kid who was probably about 5 skied right in front of me, and because I was going so fast, I had no way to avoid him. Instead, I plowed right into him. As I did, I wrapped my arms around him and spun so I was going back first. I fell over and landed on my back and slid down a few metres, and the whole time he was on top of me with m holding him so he wouldn't get hurt. I was pretty chuffed with that one.

I also studied ninjutsu for a while."

bubbish,AskMen,1390393604.0,"It sounds like you have trouble dealing with the stresses of your job. If you can't handle this on your own, you'd better seek more qualified help before it gets ugly. Here on reddit we can only give you advice and share our own stories.

I believe that stress is extremely dangerous if it isn't handled properly. To a certain extent you can get there by managing your expectations. I often cite my example of a 8hr/day stint on a deskjob during an entire summer while I was still studying. It wasn't a demanding job, neither in the physical nor the mental definition, but I was really determined to work well, long and hard. That pressure, even if it was internal, got to me in such a way that my studies suffered after coming back to school. Not to mention my productivity at said job, which just plummeted. I worked myself sick of it, more or less.

So ask yourself these questions. How important of a role in your life does your job occupy? Is there a chance that you simply dive too deeply into your job, on a mental level? How disappointed do you become in yourself, when you feel you've failed some expectation you have of yourself in this job?"

My argument is that there was no insult intended. Just because a person may possibly find something insulting, or offensive, doesn't mean that when it occurs it was intended to be insulting or offensive.

We all use words every day that someone, somewhere will find offensive, that doesn't mean we use them with the expressed intent to offend that person."

Chief O'Brien had to live with his past life and break habits he developed in his ""dreamed"" existence.  In fact, when we watched this recently, my wife said the episode reminded her of *TIL*.  

In all fairness, TNG did a good job of keeping the continuity after *TIL*.  They had an episode where he played his flute again and they made a couple references to the episode later in the series.  Additionally, I think Picard (on TV at least, let's not discuss movie Picard) was much better than most at separating his emotions and duty.

icatalin,apple,1390394519.0,"You know who should be ashamed? Lary Page and Samsung. Apple swam trough mud and bet everything on the iPhone, EVERYTHING! and worked it's ass off to build the iOS and the hardware. I don't agree with monopolization, so I am glad that Android/Windows/Ubuntu/ and whatever OS's out there exist, because you cannot put your trust in board of directors to choose the customer over money. But lets be honest Google saw what Apple did, and because it does not take 1 year to develop a new OS, they copied and made minor modifications and then sold it for less as most of the Chinese knock offs do. Look at Windows. How long did it take them to develop Windows OS for Nokia? And where are they in the smartphone industry? If everything would have been fair game then Samsung and Google would have tried to bring a real competitor to IOS, something built from the groud up but if they did that they would not be in the current position in the market. Samsung deserves what is happening to them and to be honest even worse. Intellectual property should be protected and by that I mean that Samsung and Google should have paid royalties to Apple from the start. But thanks to bureaucracy they had time to change and change Android to the point they look more and more different then IOS. We are not living in a world that we develop and work for free. We live in a world where artists, inventors and visionary's need to be paid. I hope you will create something in this world that will change the way you do things, something like a car that uses no form of fuel,  and you give it for free, so everybody can make money off it. And say I don't care if I lose hundreds of millions but at least everyone is making 10k and I am happy about that. But you will probably do as the rest of the world and try to make as much money as you can from it and then collect royalties from others who use it. And if anyones is stealing it from you, you will sue them for all they have got. But I guess it is easy to speak from the point of view of someone who did not bring anything new in this world."

dHarmonie,yoga,1390394635.0,"I am not surprised or offended in the slightest. I remember reading the articles previously published in relation to this book and it made me more cautious in my practice, and more attentive to my body's abilities. I think that's the end outcome the author was hoping to have on readers, but I can see why people are upset. I might be a little more upset if I had not just taken a yoga class with a new instructor this week that really made me nervous. I remember thinking ""Somebody is going to get hurt doing this. We're doing splits. We're not ready to be doing splits. We haven't even done a complete sun salutation. We're not warm yet. It's only been 20 minutes and we spent 10 of those in variations of table. Is this the type of class that leads to those serious injuries? Is this what those articles were talking about?"" 

There's are some factors in this study that I wish had been further elaborated upon in the article--how have teaching methods changed? How have class sizes impacted injury rates? What are the age distributions? Is there an age/ experience relationship? What effect do these factors have on injury severity? I guess I'll have to see if my university has the book. I think the overall message that yoga can injure yogis is worth amplifying. It kind of reminds me of what my physical therapist calls 'the crossfit effect.' People get the endorphin rush and positive benefits from their beginning classes then accelerate in difficulty faster than their bodies are capable of handling. This combined with inadequate training of instructors results in serious injuries. 

I'm 22, I've been doing yoga since I was 12 which started as a type of mother-daughter bonding effort. We both still practice. I have joint hypermobility (pursuing a more specific diagnosis right now) and I look back on my yoga experience and am quietly thankful I started 10 years ago and not right now. Classes at the studio I go were smaller 10 years ago and we got much more 1:1 attention from the instructor who recognized that I had joint instability. If we had been in a bigger class or my instructor had been less experienced, I shudder to think what might have happened."

That you can't do what he asks is what you learn *from*. It's the teacher, as it were. The lesson, first of all, is acceptance. ""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change"", etc. This is him granting it to you, if only you'd use the brain he gave you and realize that your failure to control your feelings isn't the result of you playing the game poorly, but of how the game's rules are set up. When you see that, you'll also see that, if the feelings you want to avoid decide to show up (or conversely, if the felings you want to have decide not to show up) there isn't a damn thing you can do about it. So you let go, stop caring, and instead focus on what you *can* change: ""And wisdom to know the difference"".

But there's more to learn if you go deeper. Let's say you covet your neighbor's wife. Then you read the Commandments and realize that God doesn't want you to do that. Since you're a man of morals and faith, if God doesn't want something then neighter do you. So now you're in a situation where you want something, but don't want to want it. How weird is that? How is it even possible? How can the same person's will point in two opposite, mutually exclusive directions at the same time? It's like making a car turn both to the left and to the right at a crossroads.

So you ask yourself ""Who am I?"" Are you the one who wants to commit adultery, or are you the one who wants to not even think about adultery? Are you the one who knows that a pious man should be above petty emotions, or the one who secretly nurtures them, or even the one who is consumed by guilt when he observes the previous two fighting within himself? Or the one who observes this guilt... there's an infinitude of ""yous"". Which is your true essence, your true Self, the one who will be judged at the end of times, when ""the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it"" (Ecclesiastes 12:7)? Which is that spirit? Wouldn't it be good to know, to identfy with only that spirit, and in so doing become capable of ignoring all the other voices within you as the mere ramblings of other people?

The Bible hints in quite a few places that what we commonly see as ourselves isn't the undivided unit we think it is. Two quick examples: 

Mark 5:1-20 tells the story of a possessed man. When Jesus asks the demon its name, it replies ""My name is Legion, for we are many"". Jesus then saves the man by removing the ""impure spirits"" from him, leaving behind just the one, pure spirit that is his original Self. 

Matthew 6 starts off so:

&gt;1“Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
&gt;
&gt;2“So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 3 But when you give to the needy, **do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing**, 4 so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

Why, in a passage about not letting other people see your good deeds (so that you may be certain that you do them out of duty and/or kindness, and not out of vanity) does Jesus admonish you to not let one of your hands see what the other is doing, as if they were two separate entities? Is it simply hyperbole, to make it clear that you shouldn't publicize your charity even to yourself, or is there something else?

Many Zen masters define their teachings as ""a finger pointing at the moon"". The illustration is meant to convey that if you focus too much on the finger itself, you'll miss the moon. And the master is only pointing in the first place because he wants you to see the moon, not his finger. The finger is a mere instrument. Likewise, the impossible Commandments and the narratives in the Bible, many of which seem to be a bit pointless sometimes, are all there for a reason that goes beyond simply telling you the story (showing you the finger). You're suppsoed to follow them where they lead you, and only then can you behold the true sight that they were meant to convey all along.

The answer to the question ""Who am I, really?"" is is the most important thing any person can ever hope to learn. Sadly, most of us go through life wthout examining the issue with the appropriate rigor, latching on instead to labels like ""good father"", ""competent professional"", ""activist for X cause"", which in the end aren't descriptions of what you *are*, but only of what you *do*. Ask yourself honestly: who are you? **God wants you to know.**

I understand where you're coming from.  One of the happiest days of my life was when I found out my ndad had died back sometime in 2000.  I don't remember the exact date, I didn't go to his funeral, and I don't really know where he's buried.  I just didn't/don't give a shit.

That said, I also had 21 years of NC with him so I didn't have to put up with his crap during that time and I was able to heal somewhat.  I still had/have anger towards him but not the open/fresh anger you apparently have.  Like others have said in comments below: do NOT wait until she dies to get her out of your life.  Do it NOW.  Hopefully you are working on this.  

And look into some professional help, holding that much anger inside is not healthy....again I speak from experience with this.  I basically destroyed one marriage with my anger issues towards my nparents before I sought help.  If you can't afford a therapist then read self-help books and continue to post here.

For this guy, it was tons of time spent trying to get a lot of ""dates"" via programming to collect data which were mostly just him paying for meals it seems--even more time sunk. Just imagining the kind of time and effort he was putting into it for so little return is really depressing."

&gt;The only thing I can think of is I can try to take the opportunity to brush up on my skills before applying to jobs in the spring/summer because honestly, I'm not sure if I had what it takes to join the workforce in my field.

This is a great mentality. Save this. Remember this. You are taking the opportunity to master something. Another benefit of only having to take one class is that you can devote all your attention to it. Get the skills you need to feel confident in yourself as a member of your field. That confidence is what will carry you through the job application process which is a challenge all by itself. 

With depression, there are some days you just have to give yourself a gold star for breathing in and out because it's the hardest thing in the world. To have university on top of that, for so long, that must have been so difficult. I can't even imagine. I'm sorry your dad won't be supportive of you. You need encouragement right now, not criticism. I don't know how to help with that. This has always been my favorite go-to words of encouragement when I feel frustrated and defeated.

“So you think that you're a failure, do you? Well, you probably are. What's wrong with that? In the first place, if you've any sense at all you must have learned by now that **we pay just as dearly for our triumphs as we do for our defeats.** Go ahead and fail. But fail with wit, fail with grace, fail with style. A mediocre failure is as insufferable as a mediocre success. Embrace failure! Seek it out. Learn to love it. That may be the only way any of us will ever be free.” 
― Tom Robbins

You got through the semester. You've gotten through 8 years. That is magnificent. You passed 2 of your classes, that's fantastic too! If the amount of energy it had taken to get a passing grade in this class last semester might have resulted in a relapse or worsening of your health, that's not worth it. It's never worth it. You're here. You're okay. That's success. When you feel bad about it, do what /u/powen01 recommended, think of what you'd tell a friend in your position.

He didn't want to put me through further pain so he confessed and cooperated with authorities and worked hard at getting better in his treatment so he got a 3 month jail sentence and was on probation after that but was not allowed to move back into the house until I graduated from high school. My mom had to take chaperone classes to learn what signs to look for before he could visit us and then he'd visit regularly. It was revealed in therapy that he had a really screwed up upbringing and was forced by his dad to have sex with his sisters and was also pretty brutally physically abused. It's amazing he could be as normal as he was prior to the abuse with how wretched his own life had been.

The biggest surprise to me in the whole process was that there were no news cameras outside our house. I thought I'd have my 15 minutes of fame for reporting my dad and he'd be publicly shamed for being a pervert and preying on his own daughter but it was all a private matter. I learned that nobody cares to alert the media if some regular boring guy diddles his daughter, only public figures get that kind of attention. Of course as I got older I also realized the news hides the identity of sex abuser victims anyways even when they do cover it.

The 3 month sentence was also pretty surprising given how often in the news you hear about decades-long sentences.

Thanks for taking the time to explain that plenty of guys get light sentences. I just thought I'd throw in some corroboration from personal experience. Thanks also for doing this ama.

bubbish,malehairadvice,1390396000.0,"I think we have similar hair, although mine is slightly less curly. You should get a good hairdresser who you trust, and ask him/her to show how to straighten your hair with a blow dryer. The best way I've found is using a reasonably strong and hot with a narrowing mouthpiece along with a round comb. There are special round combs for this, they need to be made of metal or porcelain in the middle to transfer the heat. The process is hard to describe so give me a shout if you can't learn from a hairdresser. Once you learn to do this, it only adds max 5 minutes to your routine.

Get a good conditioner, one that is made for rough and curly hair. Seriously, it makes a bigger difference than you might think. Get one and use it every time you wash your hair. Those that say ""smoothen"" or somesuch are usually good.

Also, use a high quality wax. The pictures of Justin Timberlake you've linked features heavy usage of wax, a little bit too much for my taste. But he's definitely got his hair straightened there, his natural state is curls. Either way, get a nice wax, preferably clay. My recommendation is something with strong hold and matte finish, matte always looks great.

Buscat,4chan,1390396272.0,"Basically Carthage was no longer a threat to them and had been reduced to a mercantile city-state from an empire, but Rome got scared and butthurt and made some terms with them that to avoid a war they'd need to give up hundreds of noble sons and daughters as hostages. Once they had that, they said that to avoid a war Carthage would have to give up all their weapons. And then finally, once Carthage was totally not a threat, they said ""and finally you need to relocate your entire city from the coast to 20 miles inland, lest you ever be tempted to be a threat to us again."" Bear in mind that Carthage was a maritime trading giant and Rome was telling them to move their city from the Mediterranean coast into the Tunisian desert. 

So Carthage, after killing the idiot diplomats who had given Rome any concessions in the first place, dug in and endured a siege for a couple of years, melting all their possessions to make new armor and shit. Eventually after taking a pathetically long time to pierce the defenses of such a weak city, the Romans massacred most of the Carthaginians, sold the rest into slavery, and tore the city down brick by brick, and salted the earth.

Technically he got a penta which counts into the statistics. IMO everybody flaming around he didn't earn it is just jealous they don't have a Penta. And honestly he was only fed one kill not 5 otherwise the only Pentas to be valid would be 1v5 Pentas... which I highly doubt that everybody got theirs that way.

dgnarus,leagueoflegends,1390396475.0,"Exactly, this is the main reason we see the same, stale champion pool every damn game.

I'm also really excited what the W change for Kassadin, currently on PBE, is going to bring to him. That said, Riot also completely messed up a couple of times. Rumble immediately comes to mind. Nowadays (in Gold EUW at least), Rumble gets facerolled by champions he is supposed to counter. He doesn't outdamage any of the other toplaners at any point in the game, EXCEPT if he gets the full duration of his ult off on someone.

I also usually do a more gradual turn, as follows:  
@5000m, turn to 60 degrees  
@10000m, turn to 45 degrees  
@15000m, turn to 30 degrees  
@20000m, turn to 0 degrees, burn til desired apoapsis

Capping a gravity turn off with a long, flat horizonal burn means a shorter burn at apoapsis to circularize, and places apoapsis much further away. Spending more time in the atmosphere is generally less efficient but I generally under-torque my vessels and need the extra coasting time to align myself for the circularization burn.

If you install MechJeb and use its ascent autopilot, you'll get a better idea of an 'ideal' gravity turn.

**edit 2:** Women can also be horrible people. But they don't send me these messages. So I am not reminded by these messages about how horrible women can be.

**edit 3 for clarity the type of message discussed:** 

I am going to give a quick example of the type of messages I am referring to.

I am NOT talking about every time I am contacted by a man.
I am NOT taking about every time a messages suggests that man is interested in me, or even wants to do something to me or with me.

So I am NOT talking about anything similar to these:

* ""Hey, I think we have something in common, I want to get to know you better."" *Even though this doesn't specify me in anyway, this is perfectly fine, I have no issue with this.*

* ""I wanna fuck you. Message me if you want."" *Still okay. This message is beginning a conversation. Even if a bit harshly.*

I am only referring to messages where the man (I haven't gotten one from a woman, but it would be equally upsetting) talk AT me, not TO me, and don't suggest anything about my response, or contacting them back. Like this:
 *(I'm replacing the kinky content of my messages with more regular sex so as not to confuse the issue, okay, I'm trying to, it's a bit harder for me to do than I thought.)*

* ""I'd grab you and push you into the wall, kiss you hard, make you feel my cock. I'd pull your cloths off and touch every inch of your skin, then thrust my big fat cock inside you making you cum instantly....""

* ""mmmmm yeah, sit on my face, rub that dirty snatch all over me, yeah girl, I cream your back so hard...""

*EVEN* something like this would be made far better if at the end it said something like, ""That's just a sample of what I can do. I thought you might like it. Message me back if you're interested."" But they don't. All they do is talk at me this erotica."

The only way to control this issue is to use the safe word when you are serious. And you have to know what is an unacceptable behavior for you. Even when you write that he spanked you, you don't describe a negative or positive emotion. What did you feel?

A sub/dom relationship doesn't work without communication and real consent. It's time for a serious discussion about what you both want, the limits and boundaries. "

smnytx,gifs,1390397471.0,"Ok, say I buy your analysis of the fingers.  Can you explain what he's trying to express with his face, and the fact that his fingers are facing the entire stadium, rather than his opponent?  What possible reason would he have for doing so?  He just won the heat that will take him to the Olympics.  Is the natural reaction to that ""fuck you, world!""?

And what do you make of the fact that everyone there reporting the incident focused on the middle fingers and kick of the loser, and basically ignored the the winner? To the point of disqualifying one and doing nothing to the other? Are they all in on a conspiracy of some kind?  Or perhaps was it extremely clear when viewed live from other angles?  

Let's just view this with common sense, and remember that gloves can sometimes have bumps in them when bent, possibly adding the illusion of a finger or knuckle where there is none.  Add all of that up, and I think you're doing some Olympic reaching there.

ETA: looking at the picture again, your photo analysis is clearly wrong.  The second bump you see, the one you labeled #2, is the third finger's knuckle.  This is black on black, so it is in silhouette.  The thumb is clear, as is the second finger, which is up (in #1 position).  From our perspective, the bump between the two is the tip of the middle finger's knuckle.  You can't see the next two fingers, as they are also folded down in fist position.  

Edit 2:  also, we are talking about the winner's left hand. Look at the gif again: the left hand is definitely pointing up with the first finger, not the middle finger.  There is no question here."

They would 'improve rewards', but rewards are hardly better. Yes you get a depressing amount of gold after every run, but they nerfed Fractal weapon drops (the only reason most people do Fractals), and they made uninfused rings drop in lvl30 and 40+, which is not just stupid, it's fucking insulting.

They fixed 1 single bug, the invulnerable harpies, and they introduced a [metric fuckton more](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/archive/fractured/Summary-of-Fractal-Issues-and-Bugs).

They didn't reply to a single one of our concerns on the official forums once the thing went live. Not one. Go check the Fractured! subforum, the only red post in there is a demand to keep a thread civil. No replies, nothing. Fucking silence all the way, which is still going by the way.

Bear in mind that no one was 'out' in school back then and gay-friendly kids remained silent about their gay friends orientation, it was simply not discussed, rather, quitely understood. This wasn't intended to underscore shame but it was a protective gesture in a time when homophobia and gay bashing held sway. I can't speak to having prevented suicide but the gay-friendly straight kids were definitely a protective buffer for their gay friends, especially groups of girls.

My mom talks about how she eats all the time (5'5"" at barely 100 pounds) and she'll have a plate at dinner, a bit of oatmeal at breakfast, and then have a handful of munchies throughout the day.

BarkingToad,DebateReligion,1390397935.0,"&gt;i've always thought mythicism was like young earth creationism.

There are some important differences (although I do see your point). Young Earth Creationism is definitively disproven, wholly discredited and without a shred of merit. While the vast majority of scholars believe, with good reason IMHO, that the Biblical character of Jesus is based on an actual person, there still is plenty of room for interpretation and debate in that argument.

But I will grant you that much of the ""evidence"" for mythicism presented by such people as the Zeitgeist crowd and individuals of similar persuasion is very close in nature to that presented by Young Earth Creationists (i.e. completely and unequivocally bogus)."

Here's where the scoring comes in. Whenever someone dies, they give the person that killed them one of their white flags. These white flags that have been collected can then be traded or used for bartering with other players. If someone dies on their last flag, not only do they give the player who killed them their last life flag but they also give them half of the flags they have collected off of other players.

I don't pretend to be a king of morality, I have one rule, you do what is best for humanity. There is no way to elect a leader who isn't selfish and greedy - leaders are by nature.

The key is you must discourage rampant selfishness and greed, how better to do this than by example. If you don't want to end up like the last guy, keep your shit in check.

The only other system which could possibly work is one based around no form of recognised leadership - Anarchy.

You either need to be in or out, one fuck up and the entire system turns to shit over time.

PerfectHair,rage,1390398131.0,"&gt;Feminists do not want you to lose custody of your children. The assumption that women are naturally better caregivers is part of patriarchy.

False. The [Tender Years Doctrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tender_years_doctrine) was initiated by [Caroline Norton,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Norton) first thing about her is that she was feminist.

&gt;Feminists do not want you to have to make alimony payments. Alimony is set up to combat the fact that women have been historically expected to prioritize domestic duties over professional goals, thus minimizing their earning potential if their “traditional” marriages end. The assumption that wives should make babies instead of money is part of patriarchy.

False. April 2013, [Barbara DeVane,](http://news.wfsu.org/term/barbara-devane) self-proclaimed Women's Rights Activist [lobbied against alimony reform.](http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2013/04/two-dozen-women-urge-scott-to-veto-alimony-bill.html)

&gt;Feminists do not want anyone to be falsely accused of rape. False rape accusations discredit rape victims, which reinforces rape culture, which is part of patriarchy.

Catherine Comins disagrees.

“They have a lot of pain, but it is not a pain that I would necessarily have spared them. I think it ideally initiates a process of self-exploration. ‘How do I see women?’ ‘If I didn’t violate her, could I have?’ ‘Do I have the potential to do to her what they say I did?’ Those are good questions.”

[Source.](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,157165,00.html)

&gt;Feminists do not want you to be lonely and we do not hate “nice guys.” The idea that certain people are inherently more valuable than other people because of superficial physical attributes is part of patriarchy.

[Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/5972788/no-one-is-entitled-to-sex-why-we-should-mock-the-nice-guys-of-okcupid) [disagrees.](http://jezebel.com/5969737/meet-the-so+called-nice-guys-of-okcupid)

&gt;Feminists do not want women to escape prosecution on legitimate domestic violence charges, nor do we want men to be ridiculed for being raped or abused. The idea that women are naturally gentle and compliant and that victimhood is inherently feminine is part of patriarchy.

The [Inspire Women's Project](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/ni/?id=2013-04-08.4.106) [\[2\]](http://www.pbni.org.uk/site/content.aspx?z=w~plus~cDulMergM=&amp;x=6HzjOZy9Euw=) says otherwise.

That whole blog post, and the Jezebel article it was ripped from, only looks at men's issues from the incredibly narcissistic angle that men are only ever viewed by how they compare to women, rather than taking men as a separate group with their own issues. It boils down to 'it is always about us.'

***Edit:*** [A little compilation of links](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1s66ds/a_little_compilation_of_realworld_feminism/) highlighting how feminists *do not* care about men's issues, despite what the link says.

T3chnopsycho,AskScienceFiction,1390398240.0,"This really depends on the type of immortality. Maybe I'm wrong but I think Logan isn't immortal but just very long lived (he'll live for hundreds of years). 

Other forms of immortality have different ways of handling this:

* Inherent immortality: Something like elves or the like. They tend to stop when they are at their physical height (i.e. Grown up when the body is at it's healthiest or in human terms at their physical prime like around 30).

* Given immortality: I'll take the immortals from the Highlander franchise for this one: They stop when they die the first time. So they actually live their normal lives and grow and when they die they're body stops growing / aging.
This can also include immortality given to someone at some point in their life which would lead to them stopping to age when they got it.

I had a bit of a problem to categorize these forms of immortality as there are a lot of different forms from different sources so forgive me if you don't agree xP

I would say it just depends on where the immortality comes from. Divine or inherent (belonging to a race's traits) generally tends to benefit the immortal (leaving them in their prime) while other forms tend to be random in this point."

tsukino_aiko,BabyBumps,1390398244.0,"This is all that I can give you. My friend was in an abusive relationship for close to a year. It took her 6 mos and a couple of hospital visits to even admit that it was a problem, even then she stuck with him while he tried (and ultimately failed) counseling and only finally left him when he started to refuse to take his meds or go to appointments. I was there, peripherally, for a lot of this and one thing that she has always said after was that it was nice to talk to someone who wasn't telling her what to do but who was genuinely concerned for her. (My favorite phrase was ""okay, what do you want to do about this?"")

Basically I always just listened, offered her a place to go several times and answered questions only when she asked them directly (like ""do you think counseling will help?"" ""If he won't take his meds, is it mean to leave him?"") but otherwise did my best to just be sympathetic. I know its different with kids, and of course it killed me to watch her be hurt but like you know and others have said, it's up to her to leave and judgement could have the effect of entrenching her further in his control. 

Abusers LOVE when people try to make their loved ones choose, its great to spin that around and watch the person they are abusing choose them, but ultimately (I think) judgements and ultimatums only hurt the person dealing with the abuse. That said, you know your own limits. I refused to be in the same room as my friend's husband (still do) but I was there when she needed to talk, even if that meant waiting for a call. 

I would say let your SIL know that you are ALWAYS there for her, day or night, and then leave it up to her. You can say ""this is what I see"" then offer her support, offer her counseling services, offer her a place to sleep, whatever, but don't make any of it a mandatory thing. Hope that makes sense

EDIT to say: You also might bring your concerns to the local PD and ED, so they can be on the look out for anything fishy going on there. It might be pushing it but one of the things that helped get my friend out was talking with the ambulance drivers and nurses at the ED after she had been there a couple of times.

shytemptation,technology,1390398519.0,"I remember all the hype and I had an acquaintance or two that offered to share invites but I never saw the point of joining when none of my close friends were on there. I was also not enthused to join after the whole Buzz fiasco where all your email contacts could see one another without your permission. It didn't give me much of a sense of trust that circles would really be separate or that they would be any better than Facebook when it comes to privacy. I checked it out once when they made me create an account for one of their services and then deleted it.

I think what I really want is just to be able to be anonymous on the internet again. I used to use msn messenger to keep up with gamer friends and then suddenly they put my real name out there for everyone to see and aim told my name to some gamer dude I was cybering with on a whim and YouTube always wants to put my real name up, but that's an alias I also used for games and forums for over a decade. I've gotten some pretty unpleasant harassment over the years online and it's easy to blow off when all they have is a username but I just don't feel very comfortable using most internet services anymore now that all the big sites insist on using your real name. On Facebook I don't mind because I only have people I know and trust on there, but I just don't want all my other accounts that lots of online strangers know to suddenly be revealing my name.

I miss communicating semi-anonymously over the internet with people all over the world and feeling free and safe to speak my mind and be honest and reveal my inner self in ways that I just can't do I'm front of people who actually know who I am. The internet has felt like such a freeing place because I could be true to myself without worrying about getting shunned and ostracized for my sexuality or my politics among my in person friends and family.

I miss having in depth IM conversations with people from all sorts of different walks of life.

I guess that's why I spend so much time on reddit now. It's a one-sided convo since I got spooked out of checking my PMs and responses early on by some jerk that harassed me about not truly being raped, but aside from that it feels so nice to be able to share my thoughts openly again without the fear that comes from having my name attached to these thoughts and it's so great to read the opinions and insights others around the world have to offer on all manner of topics.

Most of the online world seems to be smashing that freedom."

KosherDill,TryingForABaby,1390398552.0,"I agree with cutting down the alcohol to help with the lining and such but a glass of wine or two during the TWW won't make a difference. My doctor was on the bandwagon of ""drink until it's pink"" for a few reasons  which you may or may not agree with. 

1) After TTC for so long, just enjoy life...seriously...whether it be an extra cup of coffee, an extra cookie or a glass of wine. I changed a lot the first few years of TTC and realized I was missing out on my life because I was already trying to live protect someone elses, who in actuality didn't exist. 

2) Once you find out if you do have a BFP you stop drinking and if you're trying to TTC that can be 10 DPO. If you have trouble letting go of the booze, perhaps look into some support programs in your area.

3) The baby does not start receiving your nutrients until week 5/6 so if you had a drink or two during the TWW, things will be fine. My first OB visit I told my doctor I had some booze during the TWW and without skipping a beat he said not to worry about it. 

4) If you have a well-balanced diet a glass of wine (or beer) before finding out won't effect anything. Everything in moderation-that includes Girl Scout Cookies. 

Alcohol during pregnancy is a big No-no but for some reason your doctors phrasing rubbed me the wrong way, it almost sounded like he/she was trying to guilt you into not drinking. Obviously binge drinking (TTC or not) is bad for you and should not do that for various health reasons. However a glass of wine on a Friday night with dinner after a work week won't effect or harm anything.

I want to add one more thing! For those currently looking into IUI or IVF and practice HOT yoga on a regular basis. Please ask your doctor about if you can practice during the TWW. My doctor cut me of because well it was too hot post treatments. 

TL;DR Doctors have different ideologies, talk to your doctor. "

Here's some of the events that stick out in my mind: 

. My bedroom wall shares a wall with my bathroom. One night, I woke up in that state of confusion where you're trying to figure out what the hell just woke you up. It was silent for a few moments before the sound of something like gravel hitting the wall between my bedroom and bathroom echoed through my room. Nothing was amiss in my bathroom, snorted at my ghosts and went back to bed. 

. Laundry room is through the kitchen. One morning while gathering laundry, I walked out if the kitchen to grab the laundry basket, came back to find every single cabinet standing wide open. I was gone less than a minute and was home alone. 

. It's very common to hear two voices talking in my living room when the house gets quiet and we've all gone to bed. It typically sounds like an old man and young woman just chatting and laughing. 

. They stored dead bodies under the stage of my theatre. The feeling of being watched when you're backstage is overwhelming. 

I have more if anyone is interested. "

Women are typically more attracted to men who don't feel the need to bend over backwards to validate themselves to every woman they encounter.

That being said, attraction for men is different than it is for women. Most men don't really care about the qualities that shit testing would reveal in a woman. The only analog I can think of is that when women employ this sort of thing, they're probing you for noncompliance or dominance. If men do it, we're probably looking for a reaction that indicates compliance and/or submission. This could be as innocuous as simply seeing whether or not a woman is willing to let her hair down and come along on an adventure. It could be simply testing the waters to see how far she's willing to go."

madhjsp,nfl,1390399107.0,"You don't *have* to get Madden if video games aren't really your thing or if you want to save the money. I can see how it would be helpful for learning the names of the players on various teams and how good they are generally perceived to be, but it doesn't do anything to teach you about who's making news and playing well in real life.  

Personally, I've found that my NFL player knowledge has increased by leaps and bounds since I started playing fantasy football. Now, I could name you at least 5-10 offensive players on every team in the league off the top of my head (and a good deal more than that for some teams). Fantasy motivates you to follow player news and performance in real time and become at least somewhat knowledgeable about the better players on every team in the league. Of course, it's primarily biased towards offensive players, but delving into the world of fantasy analysis can help you learn about which defenses and particular defensive players are playing well right now as well. 

Other than that, I just watch a lot of football and read about it online."

If you have an iPhone there is an app that monitors your sleep and wakes you up at the appropriate time in your sleep cycle so that it is easier to wake up. I think the app is called Sleep Cycle, I am not sure if that's the one I am thinking of. There are also apps for Android.

I believe that 1% was the line because in the US the 1% pay less tax than the people below them. Obama was [arguing](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2012/07/obama-tax-cuts-250000-bush.html) that people making less than $250k a year (ie the 99%) should have a one year extension of the Bush tax cuts.

MaiaNyx,AskMen,1390399444.0,"I think it's easy to say that you should walk her through it, talk to her a lot about the good things she's doing, and hold her hand while guiding her in a new experience....however, that can come off as condescending and treating her like a child.

She is still an adult, who wants adult things, and has her own ideas about how these things are supposed to work. Go out on dates, see how she deals with the 'you pay, I pay, or we both pay', talk to her about work or school, ask her about her family, vacations, her pets. These are all ways to get her to open up and for you to learn her expectations are in life, career, family, etc. Don't let her do all the talking either, she needs to know what you're all about too.

Does she come from a family where her parents have been married for 45 years? This may open up her ideals of what she hopes for in a relationship...not that you will get married right away, but how her parents made it work, and how she feels or knows what a romantic relationship should look like. Does she have ambition with school or work? Are you able to keep up with that? Are you willing to support her career choices? Does she have pets and take care of them in a way that you agree with? Is she adventurous - going on fun, exciting vacations?

If she's new to romantic relationships, then it may be important for you to know more about what she expects without flat out asking. Plus, it's great to get to know each other on a more intimate level.

Do not rush into sex. Have fun being around each other and learning about each other. Move into physical things slowly. If she asks questions, guide her in a non-authority way (like a teacher), have fun with it. Ask her plenty of questions to know if you're doing things she likes and feel good.

Communication is certainly important, but just like any education it's about a good foundation and growing the concepts on top of that. Have a solid intimate friendship then learn the ins and outs of dating each other with each other.

No relationship is the same as another, and this one will be as new to you as it is to her."

A) Netflix has, by far, the most movies. Hulu tends to have less movies, but more TV series. For the Hulu pay service, you will often get a TV episode the day after it aires. For Netflix, a new season of a TV show can take 12 months or more. 

I'm also in Michigan with Comcast. Be aware there appears to be an internet outage in the midwest, and Netflix can often not stream anything. This does not affect any other internet services. Netflix has been unusuable for me (mostly) since Dec 27, 2013. Comcast tech support says Netflix data is being rerouted through busy datacenters because of an outage.

maowsers93,texas,1390399681.0,"You're trying to brush off that the TT already reported on this by playing into the narrative that the Tribune isn't a reputable source? That is a laugh. Everything you highlighted from your source is true. She grew up poor, had to start working in high school to help her family make ends meat, was a single mother at 19, lived in a trailer, worked two jobs, got into community college, and got into TCU on scholarships THEN she married Jeff Davis. Everything she listed was true. It isn't a lie. [Here is a google search of her and her divorce when the date is set to before this article was published](https://www.google.com/search?q=wendy+davis+divorce+jeff+davis&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;biw=1080&amp;bih=490&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bc_fUuj1McXjsATcoILICQ&amp;ved=0CBwQpwUoBg&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F1%2F2013&amp;tbm=). Now unless you want to say that the Houston Chronicle and Business week aren't reputable sources you have no argument here. This has been reported on repeatedly. If you or anyone else didn't know about her divorce it isn't from a lack of coverage or acknowledgement on Davis's part considering both her and her husband have been interviewed about it. 

None of this matters anyway because everything she said she did was true. She didn't get married to Jeff until after she got into TCU on a scholarship and even if she was married to him when she went to Harvard that doesn't negate the fact that she graduated top of her class at TCU and graduated from Harvard law with honors. The only reason why she brings up her story is to show people that you don't have to come from wealth or be bred for politics to make something of yourself. You have no argument. This ""controversy"" is non existent. The story about her divorce and marriage hasn't been hidden. 

Edit: To make matters extra hilarious the Dallas News has even reported on her divorce in the past. [Wayne Slater isn't even the first person in his own news paper to report on it.](http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20130926-sen.-wendy-davis-to-run-for-texas-governor.ece)"

arkangyl,leagueoflegends,1390399730.0,"Io was one of the most overpowered heroes in the game prior to the 6.79 balance patch. He had a global teleport for himself + one ally, a reliable stun, and could heal / replenish mana for the hero he teleports with himself. He was 100% pick/ban in competitive. He is also extremely squishy and relies on a partner to help keep him alive during his global ganking shenanigans. With good teamwork, Io was godlike. Unfortunately in pubs, you cannot rely on good teamwork, which is why he has a low pub winrate.

In 6.79 Icefrog nerfed Io, changing his reliable stun into a max level slow, meaning enemies have a chance to get away when he teleports his team's carry on their head. Now he's not an uncommon pick in pro games, but he is seen less than pre-6.79 days."

Watertor,truegaming,1390399749.0,"Not liking the setting is fine. Not liking the core gameplay or even the game as a whole is fine. It just shows you that you don't like the game.

However, I've liked every AC game - 3 included (I also really enjoy the 17th-19th. I find right when the 1900s start I get tired of it; is that similar to you?). I wanted to like AC4. I love the aesthetic, I appreciate the improvement of AC3's freerunning even if there's always more to improve, and I really enjoy Kenway's character.

But suddenly I realize I have to get on a boat and sail for some stupid island, and it tells me to kill whales or other boats or whatever. I've never been big on the side-crap that came with ACs outside of the secret templar things in AC2. But this is a much larger part of the game. I wish the energy spent on it was spent improving the combat and the stealth along with missions in general that are horrifically dull as is. The longer I spend on the game, the more I want to go back to AC1 and just be a god damn assassin that actually *ASSASSINATES* people

I hope AC5 is Assassin's Creed and not Pirate's Creed, Ninja's Creed, or any other creed that isn't Assassin's. But if not, that's fair. I can't exactly argue with the spike in attention AC4 is getting, so something tells me I'm going to be left behind by another favorite series of mine. So be it.

It's probably a bit on the low side - best to have some off-leash time on a daily basis - but was workable. Remember with a puppy - they can only hold their bladder about 1 hour per month of age, so especially early on, that schedule may be tight.

Sammies are very vocal. Sapphire barks when she wants attention, barks when she's hungry, barks when she's getting attention but doesn't feel it's sufficient, barks and wooOOooOoos just because she feels like talking. If there's no one around to bark to, it may not be so bad, but any noise is likely to set them off, so if your neighbors are sensitive to it, it may be difficult to control this in an apartment.

She's been fantastic with kids. She was raised around a 2 year old, and she just adores the neighborhood kids (and they love her, too- Halloween was great, she got lots of pettings).

IGotAKnife,lewronggeneration,1390400416.0,Devils advocate for a second but half life was released in 1998 and Bioshock pretty much is a spiritual successor to System Shock series witch was made in 1994. I mean the 90s were kind of a time in which video games began to form most of the franchises and even genres we see today. Most of what really has advanced is just the tools for playing with these genres. CoD the game that was inspired but the Medal of Honor series would still be around and if it had the quality of it original game it would be just as generic as it is today. Hell my favorite games are the fallout series from Bethesda and even then that's just taking the mechanics from the 1990s turn based games and giving it the feel of Elder Scrolls. Anyway everything would be the fucking same unless the defener meant it should all be the quality of [Normy's Beach-o-Rama](http://i.imgur.com/NkrHlM3.jpg).

This was the winning play for the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV (2010). They held a one-touchdown lead over the Indianapolis Colts, but with time starting to run out, the Colts were moving the ball and looked to be on their way to a touchdown that would tie the game. The quarterback, Peyton Manning, threw a pass intended for one of his own players, but it was intercepted by Saints defender Tracy Porter.  

On most interceptions, the defending player is eventually tackled or forced out of bounds, meaning that the play is dead and his team's offensive squad then comes onto the field to try and move the ball. But on this particular play, Porter had enough speed and room to run that no Colts player could tackle him, so he returned the intercepted pass all the way down the field for a touchdown. In doing so, he effectively put the score out of reach for the Colts and sealed the Saints victory, bringing that team its first-ever Super Bowl championship in 43 years of existence. "

I do think that high schools teach all the basics of what people need to know to be productive and manage their own money. I also think that it's a very good thing that finance is NOT taught in high school. Contrary to what your belief seems to be, I believe that making money is an unfortunate necessity that people need to attend to, to be able to pursue their dreams: much like defecating.

So they're all really important, and this was hard to rank these in order.

I simply will not buy from a place I don't trust.  When I'm shopping around I am looking for a specific product, so I guess brands are pretty damn essential too.  If you don't have the exact product I want then I won't shop from you either.

Once I find what I want then I start looking at prices...  I usually have a little leeway here, but the top 2 or 3 for price generally get the sale.  That decision is frequently made by browsing around and looking at the selection.  maybe something else will catch my eye and be an add-on to the purchase.  I prefer to bundle stuff up a little to save on shipping.  

Of course I shouldn't have any problems with a trustworthy store, and I'm generally good not hearing from a real person...

I think that Maybelline is the best with L'Oreal right behind them. I'm probably in the minority here, but I don't like Covergirl mascara at all. 

Other things that people have touched on; L'Oreal Infallibles, Maybelline Color Tattoos (in certain colors), and the L'Oreal version of the YSL Glossy Stains (I like the scent better). 

Topping my list right now is the new Revlon Age Defying Concealer; it's working better on me than any other concealer that I've ever owned. It just agrees with my skin and I'm pretty ok with the fact that it only costs $11."

Hernandez is in jail, and Gronkowski can't be counted on to stay healthy (and even if he does, will he be the same player after all these injuries and surgeries?). Amendola is a fine possession receiver, but not someone who threatens a defense vertically, and he too is a bit of a health gamble. Same can be said for Edelman, who's a decent player (and maybe a bit sturdier), but probably not a whole lot better than replacement-level; as in, I'd be surprised if the Patriots prioritized retaining him this offseason over adding a bigger, faster receiver who threatens the defense differently."

Even if only 5 people came we could shoot the breeze and stuff and now, last semester of senior year, we're really good friends.

Also, at work, just getting to know coworkers. I've become friends with one of my coworkers because we're both kind of tired of our undergraduate minions ruining our stuff (we work in a lab). I was also friends with the previous guys who worked there because they liked playing super smash bros, and once I joined in the conversation with how I was trying to learn how to play all the heroes, they invited me to their SSBB party.

Another thing that's also been suggested is using your hobby to find a club or something. Last summer I got into discgolf and found a few new people to play with (coincidentally, over reddit)."

  The best I have found and the only one I trust is Estee Lauder Doublewear in Shell.  It's the lightest shade they do and has more pinky tones rather than yellow.  It covers very well and if you apply it very lightly it won't look too heavy.

IMHO one should have a minimum of 50, preferably 100, finds of various sizes and types, in various settings, before placing a cache. The reasons are threefold.

1. To make sure you're really going to stick with it. Nothing chaps my hide like a newbie who finds 3 caches one day, gets excited about it, places their cache, then forgets about it. The cache decays and is ultimately garbage cluttering the map and the earth.
1. To gain experience. You'll likely model your caches after the one(s) that you've already found. Micros under a bench are not what geocaching is all about.
1. To learn &amp; understand how your local caching community operates. What caches/areas are well-received, which areas are off-limits, what's been tried before and failed, etc."

In 1936 a series of 12 tornados tore through our town and ravaged everything in their paths. Almost 500 people were killed in the span of twelve hours and the hospital became over run with people seeking help. 

So they began taking the injured to our theatre. The lobby became a make shift ER where they used the popcorn machines to sterilize surgical instruments. 

The theatre was torn apart and wood was stretched across the seats to make recovery beds. A lot of people didn't survive the treatment, so their bodies were stored beneath the stage until they could be taken care of. 

There was a young man who had been severely injured and so the sheriff put him down right there in our floor seating.

That's absurd. What you're saying might apply to legal systems, but not moral ones. The entire point of morality is the premise that good deeds are desireable in and of themselves, and bad deeds are undesireable in and of themselves. Ergo, the existence of a carrot-and-stick system is unnecessary.
In some moral systems, the carrot and stick are built into the definition of what makes a deed god or bad. However, the claim that rewards and punishment are necessary to make sense of the concepts of morality, good and evil is scandalously, obscenely false."

Start one yourself.

It's a natural consequence of the power of alliances in a parliament full of individuals. It's easier to negotiate with a single party than with a group of individuals, each with their own sensitivity and interests. Therefore you'll have more influence as part of a party than on your own, even if it requires you to support some points you wouldn't otherwise.

&gt;it's not like they actually do what they promise anyway right...

maowsers93,texas,1390402235.0,"Why would she bring up her ex husband in her campaign statements?

""Hi, I'm Wendy Davis. I was a single mother living in a trailer at 19 and worked two jobs. I had to start working as a teenage to help my family pay rent. But I went to community college, got into TCU on a scholarship, and graduated from Harvard with honors. Oh but I was married to Jeff Davis while I was in Harvard""

Why is that pertinent? He didn't get her into TCU, he didn't get her the scholarship, he didn't graduate in the top of her class for her, and he didn't graduate from Harvard law with honors for her. She did that. Why the hell should she have to list out everyone she was married to while she is highlighting her accomplishments?

Regardless, what I'm pointing out that this has been reported on repeatedly. You can't just brush off that this has been in the news repeatedly as fluff because the entire reason why this is even being deemed as controversial is because the author intentionally made it seem like he was breaking a story. He wasn't, in fact he didn't even have to do investigative journalism. He didn't interview Davis or her husband for that story, all he had to do was read and re-repot on what the TT, The HC, BW, and his own paper had already published. Davis was hardly fluff in September. She had already been in the national spot light and was just a few weeks away from announcing her bid for governor, something everyone already knew she was going to do. 

This is like writing an article right now saying you are breaking the story about Benghazi or the Perry's connections to Cintra. You aren't. It has already been widely reported on, you're just bringing it back up. Which by the way is fine, but don't do it in a manner that intentionally makes it seem like new information, especially when you've directly taken that information from other interviews you didn't do. 

Edit: And by the way the recent article from the DMN was specifically saying that Davis's accomplishments are being targeted:

[""Some will question how much of her success was her own doing, and how bad her circumstances were to start.""](http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140118-as-wendy-davis-touts-life-story-in-race-for-governor-key-facts-blurred.ece)

Wtfisthisgamebtw,Planetside,1390402295.0,"more likely be forced to have a certain loadout due to server balance, a forced ""option"" is no longer an option. Lockons in general are simply anti-fun, for both the user and the end receiver, the striker mechanic of lockon is actually quite good, however that is 1 out of 8 lock on launchers in the game, I dont simply see the point of buffing something that isnt fun.

your other points are quite good, I really like those ideas, but lockons ? no. at least not with the state of how lockons function currently. 


Also since you cant change your loadout until your vehicle is destroyed, makes you having a specific loadout to win a war, to make it obsolete is just counter productive, if for example you need X against Y to win, and after you do and your vehicle is there, you have to dump to get another one because X is only strong against Y, not anything else. same as lockons and flares/smoke, smoke isnt really effective unless you know you're gonna fight lots of lockons, but once you're done with the fight and capture it ? well you have to get rid of it.

Slukaj,pics,1390402301.0,"I'm a Boilermaker first and foremost. That may explain why I'm so angry about this.

Second, this is what I posted to my Facebook friends yesterday a few hours after this went down:

&gt;It hasn't even been a day and I'm already hearing people politicize this whole situation.

&gt;This situation seems to be one of revenge and premeditated murder, not a school shooting like what has been seen at Virginia Tech or Columbine. The victim was a TA, the shooter was a 23 year old undergrad. The victim was shot three times at near point blank range. It appears the shooter specifically sought out the victim in question. Nobody else was targeted or wounded from direct actions of the perpetrator. The shooter surrendered to law enforcement officers with no struggle.

&gt;With what little we know, it seems possible that this was a situation where the murderer wanted revenge on a TA who refused to pass a super senior. Whatever the actual motivation was, this seems incredibly personal, and the suspect wanted to harm the victim as much as possible. They don't seem to have been seeking change, they don't appear to have had a manifesto. He seems to have been simply seeking revenge. 

&gt;The man who did this was evil. There's no two ways about it and he deserves the whole weight of the law. But to call this a random act of violence doesn't quite fit. To politicize this and call for tighter gun control laws or better mental healthcare doesn't quite fit. This seems, to me, to be a situation where someone felt that they were wronged and were seeking revenge for perceived slights. And even though that's a part of the human condition, it is still an evil part of the human condition and should never be acted upon. 

&gt;My heart goes out to the victim's family and friends.

&gt;Please don't politicize what happened."

karlthepagan,java,1390402480.0,"&gt;System.exit() calls are common in overly broad try-catch blocks in app startup code that loads environment variables, properties files, establishes DB/socket connections, etc.

I've seen this practice before. The benefit is that your application is fail fast with a clear error message and this makes deploys more rapid when you have any risk of misconfiguration.

Better alternatives?

* throw chained exceptions and use logback's ""cause first"" stacktrace format ""%rEx"" - you won't have to dig down to ""caused by"" to figure out what's up
* use a proper watchdog mechanism for your services. If they don't WD out of boot look for your error.
* a/b deploys. If timing is this critical you can afford another server.

Any other suggestions?"

That usually means making quality programs, but at the end of the day it doesn't matter how you get the viewers, you just need to get them.

Moot has demonstrated the ability to build a site with massive viewers.  It doesn't matter how many times he fails, he'll always be able to secure more investment for another startup idea because investors are so desperate for a place to put their money.  A ""one hit wonder"" is a better long shot than a ""no hit wonder"", so he'll always have that advantage.  Especially if he stays positive and keeps learning from failure.

PirateCodingMonkey,gay,1390402787.0,"&gt;  I want to bottom sometimes, but he will never, ever, even consider it. He won't tell me why

here is the issue. you need to have a dialogue with him about your needs and come to an understanding. when i say that, i don't mean telling him ""you are going to top me"" but he should at least tell you why, and then you can discuss options. would you be willing to bring in a ""guest star"" from time to time? would he (and you) be ok with him using a toy on you?

&gt; should I even bother asking, and just begrudgingly top all the time?

don't stop asking. it is obvious that this is causing you to feel resentment towards him. he is not meeting your needs and refuses to tell you why. that is not healthy in a relationship. if you both want this to last, you need to talk about it."

creamcheesefiasco,SkincareAddiction,1390402812.0,"The other day, in a fit of insecurity about my facial hair, I waxed a part of my face that I do not normally wax. I normally bleach this particular part of my face because the hairs are 'baby fine,' unlike my upper lip and chin hairs, which I normally wax. For the record, I hadn't bleached my facial hair in about three weeks, so the part I waxed was not newly bleached. 

I have ended up with a major outbreak on my waxed areas. My chin and moustache, that I waxed the same night, are fine. I followed my normal post-waxing routine of cleansing with a mineral oil based post-wax oil, cold water, my Cetaphil cleanser, and diluted tea tree oil (diluted with my unscented Curel lotion). 

These may be ingrown hairs, but there is no head to them. They look like typical under the skin pimples. I have probably 15 spots, all clustered around both sides of my face where I waxed, loosely in the same dimension of my Veet wax strip. 

What can I do to help speed up the recovery? I've been washing my face, as per my usual nighttime routine (Ponds cold cream, wipe off, Cetaphil cleanser, wipe off, rinse, and moisturize with Curel). I've also been putting diluted tea tree oil on the area (diluted with either my Curel or grapeseed oil). 

I don't have anything with salicylic acid but I do have benzyl peroxide acne spot treatment that I keep on hand for the rare pimple. I also have prescription for an antibacterial ointment, called mupirocin, which I have used in the past for a staph infection (and my doctor said I can use it anytime I get an ingrown hair).

Should I use my BP ointment or my antibacterial ointment? These don't look like ingrown hairs, but actually look like acne. It's not a medical emergency or an allergic reaction or anything, it's just really unslightly looking and bumming me out. :("

To be honest, no one knows shit about this game. Sure, the designers might know a little more about balance. The pro's and high D1 players about the competitive meta and viability, and the rest of community about skins. But every time it happens that someone discovers something new OP. Remember those weeks Nunu was OP with his counter jungling?
Corki, Annie, Gragas and Orianna became OP during worlds. Trundle became OP recently against the tank meta.

But the community is QQing about every change, often just speculating about the consequences of the nerfs. Riot is extremely fast on the nerf trigger, or slow in other cases and a lot of pro's are extremely slow with adjusting the meta."

VoxMeretricis,relationships,1390403538.0,"&gt;I know these concerns sound selfish and that my primary focus should be on being there for my partner

Many of the romantic narratives drifting around our society says this, but the fact that it is just *wrong*. Your concerns are not selfish. You need to take care of yourself in any relationship, romantic or not. In fact, you have a responsibility and an obligation to protect your own emotional health when you are in a relationship with someone who, for whatever reason, can damage it. Relationships aren't about giving *everything* to your partner, they're about being a *partnership*. 

During struggles, yes, sometimes one partner needs to focus on being there for the other. There are three key aspects of this, however: the first being that it is understood to be temporary - there is some end point at which the supported partner will stand on their own two feet again. Two, the supported partner needs to do whatever possible to appreciate and mitigate the stress on the supporting partner. Three, the supported partner needs to be actively working (whatever that means for the situation) toward a solution. 

None of those things are present in your situation. You need to end it. "

The thing is, Mathematics is about objective truths regarding patterns of change and relationships between data (numbers). John Wheeler, a famous physicist and mathematician claimed that all mathematical constructs can be derived from the empty set, but I can't find a paper to back it up, only a New Scientist article, if anyone could provide one it would be greatly appreciated!
 
I personally always found mathematics to be so coherent and interconnected, so divinely ordered and full of symmetries and parallels, I feel there can only be one math, that is self-emergent, self-proving. I often like to use the metaphor of the [mandelbrot set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set). With just a simple formula z^2 +c,  an infinitely complex structure is created, mediated by simple rules. No one invented it, someone just discovered the beauty that can arise from a very simple formula if viewed from the right mathematical perspective.
 
**I dare anyone to come up with a mathematical 'invention' that isn't in reality just a connection/relation whose relevance simply wasn't discovered yet.**

Then when a chipmunk got inside the house, she made no attempt to hunt it, and at one point she and it practically rubbed noses."
Azhain,freemasonry,1390403868.0,"Being a ""good man"" isn't necessarily about satisfying some objective condition before you can be accepted and initiated.  It simply means you have a desire to improve yourself and the condition of others, and that you feel compelled to be a force of common good.  You should be moral and hold sound values.  
  
That is pretty vague, so it is best to simply ask yourself two things ""Do I want to become the best possible person I can be?""  And ""Do I have a desire to help others in my community in whatever ways I can?""  
  
If yes, you can be reasonably certain you are a good man.  Go forth and request your application with honesty in your heart and you will do fine."

abeyante,AskWomen,1390404014.0,"OP, she wasn't lying. To *her*, you're ""pretty big."" Big is subjective!!

A good way to think about this is to compare penis size to boob size. I've got fairly average sized boobs. I'm a 30DD, which sounds like a lot if you don't know anything about bra sizes. But the cups are the same volume as those in a 32D, 34C, 36B, or 38A. Big enough to be hard to hide under a shirt, but not big enough for a person walking down the street to think of me as having ""big boobs."" Yet plenty of guys I've been with have said something along the lines of what that girl told you! ""Wow, you're boobs are pretty big!"" or ""wow, your boobs are so big!"" No they're not, they're slightly larger than a handful. But to plenty of people, that's ""big."" Someone used to enormous boobs would consider my breasts small, and someone used to little boobs would consider mine huge!

This is all relative, all subjective. When a girl calls you ""big,"" she is telling you *her opinion*."

You're being downvoted because a lot of us would prefer to deal with developers that communicate rather than developers who hide in a hole for months at a time (*cough* cubeworld).  This post is kind of a special case, since the developers read this subreddit.  People are likely downvoting because they don't want the devs to come to the mistaken conclusion that your view represents some kind of consensus.

Ultimately what's going to happen if they decide to act on what you're saying is that they'll just stop giving time estimates at all.  I'd frankly rather hear their best guess (and it's not going to get any better than that) than dead silence."

maowsers93,texas,1390404392.0,"Like I've pointed out repeatedly she got into TCU on a scholarship before marrying him. She had already accomplished putting herself through school by the time she married him. So yes, she absolutely did accomplish the things she did without him. Considering she graduated top in her class and got accepted to Harvard there is no reason to think she wouldn't have just moved there with her daughter, which by the way came with her in the first place when she started attending there. There is nothing dishonest about it. To demand that she point out all her ex husbands in chronological order with her accomplishments is ridiculous. 

Yes, my opinion on this is that it is irrelevant because it has been reported on repeatedly. You can't make the argument that she hid her divorce when she's been interviewed about it repeatedly. That literally means she did not hide it. Without that bit there is no controversy. Without the very false narrative that she mislead people there is no story. Considering she's done multiple interviews regarding it that very specifically means she didn't hide it. You keep trying to make connections that are not there. If she was trying to hide her divorce she did a terrible job of it by doing interviews for places like the TT regarding it. 

Constantly glossing over that she got through half her education without being remarried and attempting to insinuate that she hid her marriage is intentionally pushing a false narrative. "

It has a feature where we can leave snippets of voice messages for each other, and we began ""talking"" in this way. Initially, I didn't know how far it would get, but we talked almost every day and we really enjoyed each other's company.

Fast-forward to Thanksgiving last year. She had nowhere to go since her family's in China, so I invited her over to my family's place (my parents live in NY). Thankfully my parents really liked her (: we had a great get-together and on the following Friday, I took her around Manhattan with a whole day to ourselves. I asked her out, and she said yes!

Since then, around two weeks ago, she has visited me in Chicago for a week (where I work). We didn't get to meet in December unfortunately, since I had to visit China to see relatives... but the wait until January was well worth it! I took her sightseeing and we had plenty of time to ourselves. Since then, we agreed to see each other once a month, and the end date to the LDR will come once she's finished with her degree in another year or so.

J_E_L_L_O,AskReddit,1390404558.0,"Think of what you did as a kid vs. as an adult. You were exposed to tons of new people in all kinds of fun and interesting ways as a child through things like:

* Sports
* Classes and projects
* Clubs / band / student gov.
* Field trips
* Boy (or girl) scouts
* Playing outside in your neighborhood

Those activities were perfect icebreakers -- they were free (to you, at least), fun, and they forced you to interact with tons of people your age. And to make it even better, none of the other kids involved were tied down by family, work, bills, or other ""adult"" responsibilities. They were all carefree and just trying to have fun.

Now what do you do? You probably see all the same people at work every day. A lot of them probably have girlfriends/boyfriends. Some of them may have children. All of them have bills to pay, homes and vehicles to take care of, laundry/cooking/cleaning/shopping to do, and possibly not a lot of spare money for going out.

The transition from childhood to adulthood is like going from a playground to an assembly line. Social interaction is unavoidable on one but takes a lot of work on the other.

My best advice is to ENGAGE. When you're speaking to girlfriends (not all the time, obviously, but in that stereotypical ""girlfriends"" way), you're not just stating facts about things and responding with the equivalent of ""oh."" Friendships with women aren't just ""we share common interests and will occasionally share information about our lives."" Engage in it. Ask questions. Think about how what they're saying would feel if it were you. Become genuinely interested in their lives and they'll be genuinely interested in yours.

So, let's look at how vulnerable I am.  I was going to type out a bunch of particulars, but suffice it to say I contributed equally (and sometimes more than equally) to the finances before I quit working. My name is on our mortgage and bank accounts. My husband can't just kick me out on the street. If he tried to, I would live off credit cards, sue for divorce, and probably end up with half our stuff. Marriage is a legal agreement which is designed to allow people to share assets. Hell, our society is still set up to ENCOURAGE one partner to stay at home with the kids.

For example, states could have easily asserted the 10th amendment to retain racial segregation on a state-by-state basis. If that were the precedent, we could live in a country where California was integrated while Georgia remained officially segregated. However, the 14th Amendment provides a much more specific framework for individual rights and was pivotal to cases like Brown v. Board of Education, which, among other things, led to nation-wide desegregation.

I know the length, the width, I know how it stacks up compared to the averages relayed by the Kinsey studies and more reliable, modern ones.  But I also know this because I'm shit at judging sizes of things, and I *had* to take a tape measure to it.  Forced perspectives are a pain in the ass when you're trying to figure out if you have a big dick or not.

But that's something you have to keep in mind too.  Most women aren't ever going to measure your dick.  Most are going to just see it (from angles you've never seen it before) or feel it (and it's not like it's always been there; they're not really accustomed to the size of it like you are).  And hopefully when you have sex, they like it and it feels good, and thus... it's big.

You also have to keep in mind that it kind of is this guessing game mixed with the old playground game telephone.  You may know your dick is 5.5 inches, but when she asks you may say it's around 6ish.  But maybe she thinks your underestimating yourself (arousal does affect size for a lot of men) and maybe she assumes your closer to 6.5 because dammit, you feel *really* good.  And hey, maybe if she's the type who talks about some of these things with her friends, she keeps it coy because hey... she doesn't *REALLY* know, so she just says it's big.  

The important thing is she likes you.  Your dick is just attached to you.  It's just a tool."

I also can't imagine that the team will be satisfied with returning the same personnel next season and expecting a different result. It's hard to make a living the way they did this year, all short passes and nothing to challenge the defense vertically. Frankly, it's amazing that they were able to get to the AFC championship, but once they did, they looked completely overmatched. If they had somehow managed to come back and squeak out the upset over the Broncos, how do you think they'd have fared against Seattle?  

Sure, the rookies could probably improve a little bit next year, and maybe Gronkowski is able to come back and stay healthy this time.

This divide is present not only in language, but also politics.

The northwest half:

* supported Yushchenko for president
* supports joining the EU
* is against being economically tied with Russia

while the southeast half:

* supported Yanukovych for president (and he is the current president)
* supports being economically tied with Russia
* is against joining the EU

Kiev, the national capital, is the pink circle along the river in the Ukrainian-speaking EU area. The government, however, is controlled by the Russian side, and absolutely ignores this half of the debate. Naturally, this sparked protests against the government in Kiev.

To retaliate, the government is imposing brutal penalties on those who protest. So essentially, the elected government is blatantly ignoring half of its constituents, and we might see Ukraine start a civil war or split into two countries if this continues."

lordfuzzywig,Warthunder,1390405134.0,"&gt;From some literature I read, it seems to me to be a consensus that La5 was on par with 109s of the time under 3000m, and FN was superior under 5km, except when 109 utilized mw50

I detailed these things already. The La-5s were competent dogfighters BELOW standard dogfighting altitude. When the Messers were fit with MW50s, the 109s outclassed the La-5s in every category at any altitude. Without the MW50s, Messers still outclassed the La-5s above 3000m. Most planes flew around 3000m-5000m. The La-5s were outclassed at that altitude and handily were defeated if they remained at that altitude for long when defensive.

Early Fw190s remained superior in their dive performance and certainly their performance at altitude. But in a dogfight at low altitude, an La-5 could handle itself against Messers or Fws by taking advantage of enemy error. It was a plane that required tactics, a methodical approach, and a cool head. It was NOT a capable plane, but the pilots in them were capable.

&gt;During the battle of Kursk the regiment’s pilots flew 25 combat missions on La-5FNs

FNs, not La5s.

&gt;[With arrival of La-5's and later La-7 to the front line units era of Bf-109 domination on the east front was over - now and up to the end of the war 'Messer' was outgunned, slower and more vulnerable than Lavochkin with air-cooled engine](http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/misc/ram/la-5.html)

Site uses inactive websites as sources, and at least 2/5 of those sources are from flight sim pages so I can't verify the credibility of that at all. But given that the sources are inactive and what it says goes against the facts, I don't really believe it at all.


&gt;[Hero of the Soviet Union Captain V Garanin noted: ‘Combats were fought at altitudes up to [13,000ft] 4,000m with obvious advantages over the Fw190 and Bfl09, both in speed and in horizontal and vertical manoeuvring. The La-5FN with an open canopy [as Soviet pilots used to fly it] overtakes hostile fighters, albeit slowly, gets on their tails during banked turns, and in a vertical air combat always turns to get above the enemy’.](http://weaponsandwarfare.com/?p=4956)

So we're taking Captain V Garanin's word on it?

Regardless, FN model. I already stated that the FN was the first iteration they did things right in. It was LEAPS better than the La-5 (M82).

Far from outperforming the 109Gs like your UNSOURCED link claims, the La-5FN carried on being a kickass plane below 3000m where other planes performed significantly worse. The canopy was designed so poorly that it HAD to be left open if the pilot had any intention to get out of it over 350kph. This continued, I believe, until the La-7.

The Russian ideology when it came to planes and tanks was ""Any plane [or tank] is better than none.""

&gt;[This was the Lavochkin La5 which proved to be 28mph faster than a Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2 at below 20,000 ft. But the German fighter could outclimb it and efforts were made to reduce weight.](http://ww2-weapons.com/Aircrafts/Fighters/Russian/Lavochkin/La-5.htm)

Another site with no sources and it contradicts heaps of evidence and actual technical analysis.

The Me109G2 was capable of going about [630kph at 7000m (20,000ft)](http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/me109/me109g.html). The La-5 couldn't even come close to that, just in speed alone, not even including its AWFUL climb rate above 3000m. 109s could fly circles around La-5s at altitude without consequence. At 6000m, the G2 was hitting 650kph -- even faster than the La-5 could go at its optimum altitude. There was literally no comparison. The G2 was leaps better than the La-5 at altitude. This is why most dogfights on the eastern front were so low to the ground (3000m or less) -- that is where Russian aircraft performed well. Not at all altitudes, as is currently the case in WT. [Kurfurst](http://kurfurst.org/)

Likewise, Fw190s had superior climb rates and max speeds at just about any altitude you choose to pick around or above 3000m.

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1390405137.0,"I'm going to play some devil's advocate here, but hopefully this will elucidate why people see it as bad (not necessarily justifying such a view).

Traditionally, men have been the ones to work and put the bread on the table, and this goes as far back as civilized society. Men are able to handle more physical loads, and are believed to be a little more dispensable when it comes to people. A man's value in the sense of traditional gender roles is determined by *how much he can provide*. A woman's value is derived from raising offspring.

The reason this is viewed as wrong is because it's flippantly going against the grain of traditional culture. People don't like this because it can spark cognitive dissonance in the back of their heads, making them question *why* they do the things they do. I think this mainly comes from people that are unhappy with certain aspects of their life. I for one would *love* to be a stay-at-home dad and spend lots of time with my children (if I had some).

There's really nothing inherently bad about it. It can only be seen as bad through the cultural frame that it is viewed in. If we lived in an Amazonian society, it might be expected that the men stay at home and take care of the young. Who knows?

Don't sweat it - enjoy the time spent with your kids."

So, the name that I chose is the feminized version of my middle name. But it really means more to me than that. When I was younger I always loved the name, it made me feel tingly and comfortable, and it wasn't because of any of the girls with my name in my class, they were jerks.

Tiseye,relationships,1390405221.0,"Right, there are two separate issues here. Facebook use and your boyfriend's actions as compared to his words.

&gt;I feel like that if you are a grown adult well out of college and high school, there is no reason to frequent facebook every day or every other day for that matter. 

Hey, I'm nearing 50. I'm on Facebook every day. You know why? My friends and family live all over the world and I like being in touch with them.

The problem is that you've made Facebook synonymous with betrayal. Facebook was the tool through which you were betrayed, but that does not make it Facebook's fault.

The second thing is your boyfriend's actions and his words. He says he'll do A, he does B. This makes your boyfriend unreliable. It doesn't make Facebook unreliable, Facebook doesn't make him lie to you.

You're going to have to decide for yourself if this is a dealbreaker for you or not. If it is, your boyfriend has already proven he won't stay off it, so you'll have to draw your conclusions from that."

Dawn Brancheau believed in the ethical treatment of animals. Dawn followed her dreams and became a marine animal trainer. She loved the whales and was proud of her work as a trainer. Dawn thrived on introducing the whales to the audience and educating them about the animals in her care. Dawn would not have remained a trainer at SeaWorld for 15 years if she felt that the whales were not well cared for. Trainer safety was important to Dawn, and it remains important to us as well.

shytemptation,skeptic,1390405341.0,"I'm really not personally a big fan of drugs. I don't smoke, drink rarely, and I've only tried marijuana once in my life. In addition to that, I love science and very strongly believe in proven western medicine backed by rigorous research over trying to find some ""natural"" plant-based cure for every ailment under the sun (though I'm certainly not opposed to scientifically researching plants and including them in medicine if they're actually proven to be useful). 

That being said, I have seen several news stories on mainstream news sites in recent years about psilocybin (magic mushrooms) showing promise in the treatment of depression to the point that it seems like this subject truly warrants further study. I have seen enough stories pop up on this issue that part of me honestly wishes I could be a participant in one of these trials since I have suffered from depression for a good portion of my life, so I won't deny that I do have some personal bias in this area. According to one of the recent studies, fMRI scans have shown that psilocybin reduces activity in some connective parts of the brain that tend to be overactive in depressed people and tend to have greater than normal blood flow in people who suffer from cluster headaches. Given that there is a demonstrable effect on the brain I think it is worth studying deeper to find out whether or not it actually is reasonably safe and beneficial to use in a clinical setting or if all the hype is overblown or dangers outweigh the benefits.

Here are a few results I've found from a cursory search for more mainstream resources than this collective evolution site which apparently has anti-vaccine and other woo according to one of the other [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/1vufaa/psychedelics_dont_harm_mental_health_they_improve/cevxfan).

Samipearl19,relationships,1390405510.0,"You've done the right thing. Now you need to stick with it.

Leave. Go be with your family. Move to where they are. That way you have someone to help you and protect the kids from this clearly dangerous person. 

Document everything. Every text, email, call, any contact from her. Don't delete them. You will need that stuff later. 

Don't give in. You are clearly much, much better off without this woman. Most importantly, *your children* are much better off without someone this unstable around them daily. She could very easily wind up physically hurting them not to mention the large amounts of emotional damage she has probably already done. 


Can your father be your divorce attorney? Can he get a friend to do him a favor by representing you? If not and you truly have no money, you should be able to contact Rural Legal Aid to help you at a discounted rate. Seriously, move where your family is. Contact a temp agency as soon as you get there. They will be able to get you doing something quickly while you can continue applying for more long-term jobs. Recultivate the friendships (and self-worth) you had before she destroyed it. And don't let her do the same to your children.

Made mostly good/moral choices, (except for the blood mage thing...). Cured the werewolves, saved the mages, sided with Cariden, saved Connor with the help of the Circle, did not taint the sacred ashes. Made Bhelen king. Did all the companion side quests (found Sten's sword, etc.). Romanced Alistair and made him king, and 'persuaded' him that having a blood mage mistress was no big deal. *ahem*. Also talked him into doing it with Morrigan to save our lives. 

Basically a mage who is generally a good person, but highly values knowledge and is always curious about the limits of magic. She let the Architect live.

My 'main' Hawke was a female mage with the 'witty/sarcastic' personality. Sided with the mages. Romanced Fenris. Dueled the Arishok one-on-one to save Isabela. Carver became a Grey Warden. Let Anders live.

Strike up convos with everybody, because you never know. Standing in line? Make small talk. Talk sports. Go to bars and chat up the people around you (if you are genuinely there to grab a beer and watch the game or something).

Use things like craigslist community to find people looking for activity partners (NOT THE SECTION FOR PERSONALS). Check meetup.com or some community boards for activities in your area. Volunteer. Find some people you like form all these events and get their contact info. As you hang out with them, you will gradually meet their friends and your circle will get bigger.

Last advice: Forget social media. It won't get you any friends, will think you have more friends than you really do, and probly 5/100 people you have on your profile would help you if you had a flat tire in the rain. So don't fool yourself."

As someone who does **not** play any MOBA game (unless you count WoW) or RTS, I have to disagree with this one. It's pretty much impossible to follow what's going on in them because 1.) The sheer number of actions taking place at any given time is insane and 2.) The animations are not nearly as helpful as you make it sound.

Hell, even though I played WoW arenas for *years* I still can't follow 90% of what's going on in a 3v3 match, regardless of the camera's perspective.

jackzander,summonerschool,1390405732.0,"Kayle was my first champ, and for the longest time I built her with Rageblade.  There are a few reasons why Rageblade just doesn't work well with her.

The biggest reason is that Kayle is squishy, and you need as much time to move inbetween autos as you can manage, both to keep out of danger and to chase down targets.  
If you're stacking attack-speed, you have to spend more time swinging your sword to get full damage output, and that means less mobility.


The second reason is that Kayle already has an AP heal, and sacrificing AP for a spellvamp/lifesteal proc gives you less health back in the long run.

KosherDill,WTF,1390405848.0,"There are a few medical treatments that really can help move things along, an IUI in particular. I'm not sure if you have ever seen [The Great Sperm Race](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAnMymnJiLM) but it really breaks down the battle a sperm needs to go through to get to the potential egg being there. The sperm has to travel into the cervix, battle hormones in my body, choose the right tube and meet up with the egg- it's a battle. 

Not to mention that some sperm are just straight up screwy. All average men have a certain amount of sperm that that ejaculate and in that mix a good handful of them can be ""bad sperm"", it's called the morphology. This means that those sperm are not healthy and are unable to swim forward, their sperm head bends funny and a whole slew of other deformities. When a man ejaculates they are not all healthy swimmers (sorry, guys).

Now some couples may choose to get involved with Artificial Insemination, which literally injects the mans cleaned sperm (it's a process that gets rid of excess proteins) into the uterus. This gives the sperm a better chance to meet up during ovulation. Prior to this one or both parties in the couple may have taken a hormone of some kind to help produce sperm and/or create ovulation.

incogito_ergo,financialindependence,1390405980.0,"IMO individual investors have some advantages vs. Large funds. 

1) purchases don't move the market, so you get overall better pricing, and don't have to develop complex transactional strategies. You can also take a substantial position in smaller companies, something not feasible for larger funds. 

2) no redemptions. You can ride out a strong premise even if it is down for a year or two, while fund mangers would be having to close positions due to redemptions.

3) not driven by short-term performance (e. g. 2/20 means it is better to have either a huge gain or a loss than consistent small gain in terms of compensation)

4) no pressure to trade. You can do 1 trade per year if it makes sense (or 0). Most funds would start to come under pressure for doing that (""what am I paying for?"")

Basically, the motivations (personal compensation) and dynamics of managing a large fund are very different from the dynamics of being an individual investor. 

Not all of these apply to all funds, but there are definitely some cards stacked against larger fund managers. Warren Buffett thinks that as a small (&lt;$1M) investor, he could produce 50% annual returns. Even if you're not Warren Buffet, it IS possible for you to beat the market if you put in some work. "
robotfriend,SexPositive,1390405980.0,"&gt;in this context it's mostly to understand people and empathize well enough to figure out if they are trustworthy

You aren't understanding people, you're assessing their potential threat level in relation to you, and whether or not they'll lie to you. That has everything to do with YOU. ""Empathize well enough to figure out if they are trustworthy?"" I'm not being an asshole, but using empathy in that way shows me that you do not understand what it means.

High EQ should have you in a place where you're wanting to leave people better than you found them; capable of withstanding a little more emotional strain (not at the expense of your well-being) than most, and able to build someone else up. Or if nothing else, provide a positive experience as the partner coming to the table with more emotional stability under her belt, not leave them questioning and confused. Caveat, you don't have to save the world with your fee fees, sometimes people present as more emotionally put together than they actually are, and sometimes people just need to psychologically self-harm themselves (for now or forever) and you have to give what you can and walk away when you have to.

For years he tried to placate me by allowing me to have relationships with women. But I also knew, especially over time-that I was hurting him greatly. Also over time I became frustrated with not being able to fully be with whomever I was in a relationship with. Husband and child obviously had to be number 1 but I wanted a woman to be my number 1.

It took medication and a year of therapy for me to get the nerve and the wil and the words to leave. I crushed that man. I hurt him beyond belief when I left. Although at the time I was so caught up in my new found freedom, I still have very deep regrets about leaving. Not because I wasn't being true to myself but because he was the father of my child and aside from our lack of a sex like, my best friend and a good dad.

I have never shaken the feeling that I should have stayed. I know that life goes on and this has been years now and presumably, we are both happy(ier?)but when I think about how my path to happiness hurt him and my daughter (by essentially breaking her otherwise happy home) I still have guilt. Not saying you should! I know I did what was right for me at the time. I just always wonder; if I lived with things how they were for ten years, what would have been ten more?

In the decade since then, I have had several LTR's. Today I am single and my daughter is grown. I never found ""the one"" and am no longer in pursuit of her either.

1. Their societal norms foster a culture with a tendency to responsible living (""Why are Jews always *rich?*"")
2. Their societal norms foster a more interconnected community, allowing for opportunities denied to individualistic societies (""All these Jews know each other, conspiracy!"")

Dustl,FullmetalAlchemist,1390406240.0,"The pacing for Brotherhood was odd, yes. However, I attribute that to the fact that the creators understood that everyone knew what those first 11 episodes would be about since they watched FMA. So they got through those quickly so they could differentiate the series.

As for the homunculus:

* Wrath was awesome. He was a much deeper character than Pride was in FMA.  He was trained for the sole purpose of becoming the leader of the country, and he was then forced to become a homunculus.  And although he was angry (an anger I do not think we can understand) at everything around him, he still managed to find someone he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. When he is dying and La Fing asks him if he has any lasts words for his wife, his response is something like ""I chose my wife. There are no more words that need to be said between us, only that. That is what it means to be the wife of the Furher.""  That's... really awesome. No other homunculus imbdes themselves so deeply with humanity as Wrath did.

* Lust disappeared quickly, yes. She was a plot device use to give Roy and Hawkeye more character development. I didn't care for Lust in the original, so this never bothered me.

* Sloth was boring. That was kind of the point, though.

* Envy had much more development in this than he did in FMA. He finds glee in killing Hughes unlike anything he felt in FMA. When he gloats to Mustang about it at the end of the show, it truly shows his contempt for humanity. But very quickly you find that contempt is almost entirely because he is jealous of the bonds that humans form. He cannot accept his jealousy and desire to have what humans have, so he looks down on them. 

* Pride was interesting. I personally do not like him, but that's because he didn't do much and yet was so full of himself. I loved how the being that thought himself the greatest was the one always held in a container. He couldn't move a foot further to kill Hoenheim. He couldn't do anything if he was in the dark. Most of the time, he was totally useless compared to the other Homunculi and yet he was so proud of himself. It's a great dynamic.

* Gluttony was pretty much the same in Brotherhood as he was in FMA.

* Greed was much cooler in Broterhood. To me, Greed is the Lust of Brotherhood. In FMA, Greed dies so quickly, and we never get to explore a homunculus who truly wants to have human relationships and come to love the community he is in. However, Brotherhood expands on this greatly, and we get to see how Greed truly wanted what humans had. I loved his dynamic with Ling, and it was great to see one of the seven vices come to terms that what he desired and what he said he wanted were two different things.

While you say Brotherhood had needless padding, I thought the pacing was good, especially in the ending episodes. Each episode left me wanting more, and I was glad how long they took to tie everything up. In FMA, everything happened very quickly, and I was **hugely** disappointed by its ending. Mostly because they tried so hard to get their bodies back and nothing but tragedy happened to them. As much as Brotherhood's ending was 'too happy', I at least felt content that the characters I grew to love went on living.

Here are some problems with the character's endings in FMA:

* Mustang goes off to live by himself in the North. Ignores relationship with Hawkeye completely, although they hint at it happening at the end of the show. This relationship actually happens in broterhood.

* Ed abandons everyone in his original world to go back to our world. I understand why it was necessary, but I thought it was frigging stupid. he lost **everything** he worked for at the end of the show.  Not satisfying at all.

* Al losing his memory was cool, and I understand why it happened. However, at the end of Emperor of Shambala, he crosses over and magically regains it. No explanations at all. We also never get to see an Al vs. Ed fight to see who is the best alchemist. In Brotherhood this doesn't matter, because Al sees the truth and stays a competent alchemist throughout the whole show. In FMA, it does, because Al kinda sucks being an alchemist because Ed is so good.

* I feel like they missed a great plot point with Al's memory being missing. I was sure that they were going to go back to their world, and their next journey was going to be figure out how to Al's memories back.  That is a great journey to go on for the two brothers. But no. They go on an adventure to find the nuclear bomb brought over to our world. And in the end, we know they failed in this mission because the secret to nuclear weapons was revealed. Just like their first journey, they failed and did not find exactly what they were looking for.

* Greed dies within 3 or 4 episodes of meeting him. It's a big point for Ed's development, but we lose a very great character in the process.

* The World War 1 shit was just... kinda messy. It was an interesting take, and I liked it, but I felt the story made more sense how Broterhood wraps everything up. 

On top of that, I do think you prefer 2003 because you were young when you watched it. I've watched both 2003 and Brotherhood in the past month. I went into Brotherhood going ""there is no way this is going to be as good as FMA. That show was fantastic"".  I now like Brotherhood a lot more than FMA. I still love FMA, but think the manga story is better."

Each 'x' on the top line is a hit on the high hat (cymbals are traditionally marked with 'x' instead of • to make it a bit easier to read). Each '•' on the middle line is the snare. Each '•' on the bottom line is the kick drum.

Each note with a '&gt;' at the top is to be accented, or hit harder. Each note with parenthesis around it like this (•) is a ghost note, and is to be played lightly. 

The sticking is at the top for the first half of the measure and at the bottom for the second half for the sake of space conservation. Each note marked with an 'R' is to be played with your right hand, and each with an 'L' is to be played with your left hand.

The lines at the top indicate what fraction of a beat each note gets. These are 16th notes (as denoted by two lines at the top) grouped together in fours, to indicate what beat each one falls into in 4/4 time."

blackinthmiddle,politics,1390406271.0,"Well, they *did* become cops to uphold the law, right? They're the ones that took the job to uphold the law. Yes, I get it. They squeal on their fellow cops and all kinds of shit happen to them. If I were in that position, before I squealed I'd have to get a ton of evidence so that even if I lost most job (which I'd probably want to at that point), I'd win a civil lawsuit. 

For example, everyone knows that cops are instructed to stop black men in NYC under the unconstitutional stop  and frisk bullshit. Of course, if you don't have proof of this, it's easy to dismiss your claims as you just being a whiner. Well one cop was sickened by what he was told to do and made sure to record what his supervisors were telling him to do on multiple occasions. 

Get evidence. Get lots of evidence. Get it on video. Get it on audio. Get it in writing. Then, go to lawyers who are privy to how the police system works BUT ARE NOT WITHIN THE POLICE SYSTEM! You may want to go to the local news and give them a copy of your evidence. I'd then upload my evidence to youtube. Evidence has a way of ""disappearing"". 

Is this a lot of work? Of course it is. But again, the job of a cop is to uphold the law, not collect a paycheck. We always praise cops for their difficult job. Well...this is one of those times where their jobs get difficult. They can either count down the number of days they have left until they collect their pension or they can do their job."

Yes, your life will end and things will go on without you, and you'll be unaware of everything, including the ""darkness."" But think of it this way: before you were born, you knew nothing, felt nothing, and there was darkness, but it wasn't so bad. You didn't even care. There's nothing to be afraid of, people die all the time and I've never heard anything all that bad about it (so long as the actual act of dying wasn't horrendous). You'll be here until you die, and until then, you make an impact on every person around you. You might have children, you may save a life, you might even unintentionally keep someone from dying by an ordinary act. Everything you do affects people around you, and THAT'S your impact on life and the entire world around you. You might smile at someone and put them in a good mood and perhaps your random friendliness would cause a Scrooge type person to turn their life around. That person could ask someone to marry them and their great grandchildren could be a hugely influential person. The truth is, the real unknown is how other people take your impact and use it in their lives, and the effect you have possibly hundreds of years beyond your mortal life. 


It definitely is a fragile insignificant temporary illusion, but you could try using it to your advantage. You have this illusion, and so does everyone else, so why not enjoy it while you're here?

dakboy,personalfinance,1390406501.0,"Option 1: You should be doing this already. You're missing out on a lot of free money for your retirement here.

Option 2: ""I have no idea how much this will cost, I'll likely just go through my company."" - You should already know this and be doing it! Talk to your HR department. They can tell you exactly how much it will cost per paycheck. Your insurance premium will be deducted from your paycheck pre-tax, so that will lower your taxable income.

Option 3: ***This is the dumbest thing you could possibly do.*** You already have a decent credit score, and as long as you keep making your current payments on time and responsibly using a credit card, it will only go up. Whoever keeps perpetuating this bullshit about having loans just to improve your score needs to be taken out back and shot. /u/whiteraven4 is completely right, you should **never** look at paying interest just to improve your credit score.

Option 4: ""Pay off my college loans. I don't want to do this because it's an installment loan and keeping it open will continue to help with my credit score.""  See above. Stay current on the bills and you'll be fine.

That said, there are some arguments against paying the loan off right away - mostly because the interest is tax-deductible.

My recommendation:

1. Get in on the 401k. **ASAP**. Contribute at least enough to max out the company match.

2. Get the health insurance stuff figured out. Go talk to HR about it right now. You'll be in their office/on the phone with them anyway while you're figuring out the 401k.

3. Pay down your highest-interest loan as aggressively as you can. Pay the minimum on the other. In this case, that means flipping your car &amp; student loan payments - you should be paying extra on the student loan which is **double** the interest rate of the car loan. If the student loan is paid off before the car, take the full amount you were putting into the student loan into the car."

mhblm,AskReddit,1390406507.0,"&gt;Their main whale, Tilikum, has a violent history that they're well aware of, but they ignore because they need him for breeding purposes.

This is actually fairly common for breeding stock of a lot of species. Generally bulls, stallions, rams, boars, etc are more aggressive than females or neutered males of the species. Sometimes they're even dangerous, and it's not worth even being near them to correct it. It's something that farmers sometimes just have to deal with.

Everything else you mentioned is of course really fucked up, but this stuck out as something that I've seen before and have less of a problem with.

I don't know why they are under-enrolled, but I think it might have to do with who is defining fully enrolled.  They aren't jam packed classrooms like CPS by design, so if it's CPS or the teachers union saying this I wouldn't pay much attention to it.  I think they may just be trying to under cut the charter schools who are like their arch nemesis.  This is because charter schools produce better results from the same pool of kids with the same resources than the public system does.

I don't know if you read the blog post linked in the post, but if not it outlines a lot of really good reasons why the ""homophobes are closet gays"" line is both offensive to gay people and exculpatory for homophobes. 

In reference to the study, I haven't read it, but I'd take it with a grain of salt. Of course there are extreme homophobes who are actually gay and are expressing the self-loathing that society has inflicted on them. Those individuals are a sad symptom of our homophobic society.

usedforsecrets,WTF,1390406835.0,"Cement: Cement is made from limestone, calcium, silicon, iron, and aluminum, among other ingredients. This mixture is heated in large kilns to about 2,700°F (1,482°C) to form a product known as clinkers, which roughly resemble marbles. These are ground into a powder and gypsum is added, creating the gray flour-like substance known as cement. When water is added to cement, it triggers a chemical process that allows it to harden.

Concrete: Concrete, in contrast, is a masonry material that uses cement to bind together crushed stone, rock, and sand, also called aggregate. Cement makes up from 10% to 15% of the total mass of concrete; the exact proportions vary depending on the type of concrete being made. The aggregate and cement are mixed thoroughly with water, which starts the chemical reaction causing the cement to harden and set. Before this happens, the concrete mix can be poured into a mold so that it will harden in a specific shape, be it a block or a slab.

The amount of time it takes for concrete to set depends in part on how much gypsum is added to the mixture. This time can be accelerated by adding calcium chloride or slowed by adding sugar. These compounds work by affecting the development of the hardening crystals that form as concrete sets. Concrete that is exposed to freezing and thawing conditions may have additional chemicals added to help prevent cracking."

TC10284,sysadmin,1390407022.0,"I don't have any alternatives yet because I use so many of their features - alerting, deployment links, hardware/software reports. I'd like others input on this. 

I wanted to add my comments that I posted on their forum:
&gt; I use Central and LMI pro to manage all my client computers (outsourced IT) and receive alerts when servers go unreachable.


&gt; Right now I'm sitting at right at over 500 computers on my Central account. Looks like I'll be spending countless hours sorting through computers that haven't been online in a long time to delete them JUST so I can avoid being stuck in a higher priced tier...

&gt; Years ago when you took away grouping of computers in LMI Free for no other reason than to entice/force people to purchase Central, I specifically remember your own forum reps saying ""LMI Free will ALWAYS remain free"" or to that effect.
See here: 
http://community.logmein.com/t5/IT-Support-Professionals/No-computer-groups-in-new-Console/td-p/30269/page/2


&gt;Next it was limiting non-Central users to 10 LMI Free computers per account. I ignored this because I w as exempt still.

&gt; Now it's ""buy a subscription or get lost"". 

&gt; Look, I totally understand business expenses and paying for the value of the product. HOWEVER, a few years ago before all this ""taking away"", I purchased Central due to the benefits it provided (grouping, alerting, reporting, deployment links). Then I purchased LMI Pro for servers and other important computers to get hardware reports and alerting.
Why should I be stuck in a higher priced tier and what benefit does this provide to me? 

&gt; Users have been complaining about things being taken away each time this happens, but LogMeIn doesn't buckle to user complaints. They carry on. 
However, I'm personally very close to throwing my hands up with LogMeIn as a whole because of this mess. 

&gt; I'd like to simply ask:
Why?

&gt; What's next to be taken away?

&gt; UPDATE:
After spending 2+ hours going through my entire list of computers in all my groups mind numbingly deleting 159 computers one by one, I've made my decision to find an alternative solution that LogMeIn provides to me. It may be difficult, but I have to. This is just aboslutely ridiculous and inconsiderate of your user-base. 

&gt; First because I'll be stuck in a higher priced tier of $799/year, which was quite a jump from $299/year. I am a small business. I cannot easily afford that kind of a price jump. I would have been paying $1499/year, had I not cleaned out my list. 

&gt; Second because I had to waste all that time deleting computers individually, one-by-one. 
Proof - http://i.imgur.com/zfK8oll.png

&gt; Third, and most importantly because I am sick and tired of LogMeIn taking things away along with price increases. Again I ask, where's the benefit that I'll get from paying more? 

&gt; I dare LogMeIn to ask me to take a user satisfaction survey...

&gt; LogMeIn should scrap this plan and apologize to its users, but we all know that will happen, right?"

screenmagnet,sex,1390407064.0,"Okay, after doing some research on pubmed, I believe it's the low fat diet that is probably the culprit in your case. Reduction in saturated fat intake causes a decrease in estrone, estradiol, free estradiol, and free testosterone levels and an increase in SHBG levels in both premenopausal and post menopausal women. That is the perfect storm for female sexual dysfunction.

The reason I was asking about vulvar discomfort is because it is a pretty good indicator of low estrogen levels. Are you experiencing loss of vaginal elasticity, discomfort during penetration, thinner or whiter vulvar skin, vulvar itching/pain/burning/stinging or other discomfort, bleeding, loss of vaginal lubrication, difficulty with genital arousal, stress urinary incontinence, or increased UTIs? These can all be signs of vaginal and vulvar atrophy due to lack of estrogen.

Signs of low testosterone/high SHBG are low sex drive, low mood, low energy, increased sleep, less acne and less oily skin, decreased clitoral size, and possibly difficulty with genital arousal and achieving orgasm.

I highly recommend you check your hormone levels. If your diet is causing low hormones, your options are:
1. Switch to a ketogenic diet (low carb, moderate protein, high fat) - personally, I would recommend this over a low-fat diet anyway. I don't like low-fat diets for weight loss for the average person. A proper ketogenic diet can be much healthier than a low-fat/low-calorie diet. Most people use keto diets as an excuse to eat tons of crap food, but you don't have to do it that way.
2. Increase your estrogen replacement, add vaginal estrogen cream/suppository, and/or add transdermal testosterone therapy.

I would also try ditching the wipes first to see if that makes a difference. There could be some ingredient or preservative that is irritating you. I know you started the wipes before this happened, but irritation reactions can sometimes show up after long periods of cumulative use. Or the wipes can be causing a noticeable reaction only in the presence of low estrogen levels. Is there a specific reason you need to use the wipes? Are they fragrance free? How many ingredients are listed on the box?

Also, just to double check, you haven't started any antidepressants recently, right?

Finally, you should rule out any underlying disease processes. Are you on estrogen replacement for surgical menopause or something else?"

Yes ""be yourself"" is a simple platitude, but, in the end to be more confident, better at reading social situations we must be self aware. This is a point often left out in these discussions. Confidence, and understanding other peoples perspective requires a self awareness, and and ability to place yourself in someone else's shoes. As a teenager I had no idea who ""I"" was, but as I figured that out the other stuff became easier, and as I've changed and grown my self awareness has also changed. Be yourself is a simple way of saying be aware of what you want, who you are, and be unafraid of who that is (the hardest thing as a teenager). In many cases this becomes a problem because of low self esteem, an uncomfortableness in ones own skin, or even things like depression, and anxiety. Unfortunaltly no one on the internet can diagnose any of that. When someone comes to this or any subreddit, and asks about finding a girlfriend, or infidelity, or even asking a girl out, the best anyone can do is to give them general advice (unless they offer clues to some deepseeded issue)."

DERangEdKiller,AskReddit,1390407203.0,"I'm here to tell you bro, stealing from Rite-Aid, any supermarket, or just plain period is not worth it especially if it's for any other reason than surviving

I've gone into plenty of details about my criminal past before, mostly from when I was a juvenile and stealing from a god damn store was the only thing I got caught for.  Let me let you in on a little secret.  The lose prevention that does care will cath up to you if you keep it up.

Eventually, one of the supervisors or managers who has to answer for that shit when they do inventory will start going on a rampage because that shit will affect their jobs, especially if you don't buy anything.  that's really suspect, and how I got caught.

When you get caught, the first thing that is going to go through your head isn't ""oh they got me"", it's going to be my parents are going to be so fucking pissed, and you know what, that might not be the worst thing that happens.

I was detained and cuffed to a fire-escape ladder while the manager called the police.  I was sweating, but I've dealt with cops before.  What really sucked was when they called my parents.

Now I didn't hate my parents, but I practically never saw them, and when I did, we didn't really get along.  My father was heading home from work, and my mother was closest so she picked me up.  

I thought she'd do her thing, smooth everything over, and then tear me apart at home, but that's not what happened.  My mother was pissed, but she was also shamed by what I did.  I'd never heard my mother legitimately apologize for anything before.  Not like she did for this.  It was like someone broke the strong woman who raised me.

After I got my ticket and being told what I'd have to do with the courts, we went home.  Mom was silent the whole way, and I was not expecting it.  She always threatened us when we were little with the standard, ""Wait till your father gets home."", and that was always a sobering idea.

When we got home, my dad arrived a few minutes after us, and I was ready to take a beating if I needed to.  Instead, when my father came into the door, he looked right at me like I ripped out his heart, and I guess I kind of did that day, and then it was like he saw right through me as he walked up the stairs to my parent's room, and closed the door.  He was in there for 4 hours.  When he came downstairs to eat dinner, he didn't make eye contact with me, so I just went to my room to hide from him.

Having done something bad enough your own father couldn't look you in the eye was the worst feeling in the world, and having to see my mother have to cater to us for dinner without speaking all night was gut wrenching.  Please don't steal.  The free perks, and buzz you get from getting away with it is really not worth it bro.  "

jareths_tight_pants,Hair,1390407699.0,"I'd been dying my blonde hair a dark strawberry blonde for about 10 months, then decided to strip it and re-dye it back to my natural dark ashy blonde. I had been using Age Beautiful dye from Sallys which doesn't contain any metallics so it was fairly easy. I used Color Oops, left it on for 20 minutes after wrapping the cap in saran wrap and sitting outside in the heat, then scrubbed it in the wash for 25 minutes taking turns between cleaning it with shampoo and Dr. Bronner's Liquid Castille Soap. That stripped the dye to the lightened level, a nasty brassy yellow. 

I re-dyed it that day with a blue based ashy blonde that was one lever lighter than my goal, added a violet toner, neutral protein fill and the 20 volume developer, and let it sit only for 5 minutes before rinsing it out. My hair was still a bit warm toned but it was definitely blonde and it covered really well. I used lots of conditioner and a keratin argan oil leave-in treatment for 2 weeks and y hair is fine. No breakage or damage and it feels fine now.

So what? My reasons for buying liquor are none of the government's business. Why should the state (or the feds) have any say in determining whether I have a *valid* reason to drink? Alcohol is not like a prescription drug, where a doctor can prescribe it to you only for a *certain* purpose. The fact is, alcohol is legal and sold over the counter. 

More importantly, I think this particular argument is flawed because there's no way to draw the line from a legal perspective. If I buy liquor at 5pm, I must have ""good reasons"" to drink. But if I buy liquor at 4:59pm, or at 10pm, then my reasons for drinking are ""bad""? Who has the authority to decide when there's a good time to drink and a bad time to drink?

I was sobbing and completely hysterical, and I'm pretty sure they just gave me the Demerol so I would get back in bed and shut the fuck up. (It worked. I was soooooo high.)

IME, phenazo is the only thing (other than IV narcotics) that does anything for UTI pain. Tylenol, Advil, codeine, even Percocet doesn't even touch it. Phenazo actually numbs the bladder and urinary tract, which is why it works.

The OP rubbed me the wrong way because of what her doctor said to her, it came across as fear mongering and causing unnecessary stress for the person TTC. I have no idea if those are her thoughts on the subject or if she's just repeating her doctor but many women come here asking that question about alcohol. I just wanted to share my perspective and really stress, talk to your own doctor about it. 

Each woman is different- maybe a person has high blood pressure, maybe someone needs to gain/lose weight- basically there is a whole slew of reasons why a woman should or should not drinking during the TWW. Talk to your doctor but for me a glass of wine or two was not an issue and since most women here are TTC ,they find out way earlier about a BFP then couples who possible have ""accidental"" pregnancies. There's a good chance that those that become accidentally pregnant may have been drinking during and beyond the TWW and went on to have very healthy, happy children.

TheFarnell,Quebec,1390407996.0,"&gt; Est-ce que c'est parce qu'ils ont une peur des étranger? Je crois pas que c'est le motif pour laquel ont à exiger un code vestimentaire très précis pour nos policiers.

En effet.  Il est parfaitement raisonnable d'exiger un uniforme unique et bien distinct des policiers, puisqu'il est nécessaire à leurs tâches qu'un citoyen soit facilement capable d'immédiatement identifier un policier, même à longue distance ou dans des situations chaotiques, et donc une apparence standard est nécessaire.  Certains corps policiers permettent des petites modifications (la GRC permet un turban ou voile standard, par exemple, qui est conçu pour cadrer bien dans le ""look"" facilement identifiable du policier), mais il est évident qu'un policier ne pourrait pas porter une burqa.  Il y a aussi, dans le cas du policier, une question de sécurité - le policier doit être relativement libre de ses mouvements puisque ses tâches peuvent inclure de l'activité physique intense, et donc les modifications permises sont fait en fonction de ces besoins aussi.

Ceci étant dit, ces justifications sont basées sur des besoins *fonctionnels*, et non sur une conception nébuleuse de ""l'apparence de neutralité religieuse"" de l'état.  C'est donc beaucoup plus facile à défendre, à légiférer, et à appliquer.

Cependant, pour un employé de l'état qui travaille dans un poste où un code vestimentaire stricte n'est pas imposé par la nature de ses tâches, il n'y a aucune raison, à part la peur ou l'hostilité en vers ce qui est ""autre"", de ne pas lui permettre le port de symboles religieux.  Qu'un technicien en réseaux informatiques porte un turban n'affecte en rien sa capacité de remplir ses tâches - lui proscrire ce turban n'est que fait par une peur ou hostilité (ou simple inconfort) en vers cet aspect ""autre"" de sa culture, et donc, c'est de la xénophobie."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390408013.0,"&gt; doesn't make sense unless we are operating under the assumption that you were ignorant to the fact that there are dangerous people out there before you receive such messages.

Yes, to some extent.

The timing coincided for me, and I think probably does for a great many women.

Growing up, girls and boys aren't necessarily all that different in size and strength. And, as far as I can tell, men continue to grow in size and strength later in life than women.

I'm small. I was small in high school, compared to everyone. But somehow, in my 20s, men continued to get bigger. Not taller, but fill out more. And got stronger. And in small (or larger) physical altercations, my relative weakness became more and more apparent. 

With this new-found awareness of how vulnerable I am, how at the mercy I am to others around me, I become more aware of potentially dangerous situations.

At the same time, I'm looking to meet people, social websites come up, and I start receiving messages of all kinds, including these. 

And they highlight this particular way in which I am vulnerable.

Now that I have adjusted to, and accepted that things are as they are, (dangerous people exists, I so happy laws protect us, I am so happy for the general decency of most people), each new message *doesn't* drive the stake home further.

But it does serve as a reminder.`

There are plenty of other examples of stuff like this, that are upsetting and/or shocking at first, but then you get use to them. Then when you see more examples later, they don't have the same impact, but they also don't let you forget.

Like, how many people steal if they can, *(also lots of people don't),* people following laws to the letter instead of the spirit to further themselves and in so doing, screw others over. Things like that.

use_more_lube,changemyview,1390408016.0,"I disagree. 

I think, by default, a person's sovereignty of their body is theirs, just as the distribution of their possessions after death is theirs. 

Moreover, unlike possessions, their body is intrinsically THEIRS. 

Although I support and encourage organ donors, (I'm not only an organ donor but I have donated blood and I'm also on the bone marrow registry) if we own nothing else in this world, we at least own our bodies.  

Edit: I explained my main issue with default=YES [down here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1vup0f/organ_donoring_should_be_optout_not_optin_cmv/cew2gin)


Edit2: Ok, several things. 

**Please Read This**

If the default is ""organ donor"" that means that if someone dies, they may be a candidate for donation. 
Do you seriously think that there will be no hitches in collecting and disseminating this information? 
That privacy concerns aren't an issue or that database glitches won't happen? 

I'd like to stress, once again, that I think someone who refuses to donate is an absolute shit. Ok? 
I do not condone the behavior, I barely understand the reasons, and I think it's the epitome of selfish. 

I know someone who is on a transplant list, and I know someone who just got a kidney. 
This is not abstract for me. 

But, it's my body. It's my choice.  If it's their body, it's their choice.
Making the default ""donate for the greater good"" is wrong - not only because paperwork gets lost and computers crash - but because the only thing we truly own is something that we wear around. This meat envelope.

I choose to donate. I do not feel that choice should be assumed.

My father came from an abusive household, so he spent as much time as possible playing sports as not to have to go home. This got him a full ride, all expenses paid trip to college because he was overwhelmingly best in state in the no-limit wrestling class.

It turns a shield- normally defensive- into a heavily offensive component of her build.  I usually use a Bee and trade some survivability with damage output, but when I'm going solo, I switch it out for a Black Hole or Firehawk (or, you know, a regular ol' Nova shield, if you're not at a point where you're farming for legendaries).  Shield goes down, shield kills someone, shield goes right back up.  Rinse and repeat.

I've done some testing and it does seem that anarchy is applied before Amp damage, and Amp is added onto the endcap of damage :c

Be careful when using Amp shields+shotguns though.  It still adds damage, but the amp damage is divided among the pellets listed on the item card, so the less pellets that hit the enemy (as few often do with Anarchy builds), the less amp damage you're actually doing."

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1390408318.0,"&gt; but he's kept on saying to me that she's just like a sister to him and that he's never had feelings for her,

Okay... does their relationship *seem* sibling like to you? She gets all freaky when he's busy with his girlfriend, they fight like a couple, they lay in bed uncomfortably close watching movies, she sits on his lap, he calls her baby, she says that he's ""hers"". I'm sorry, but if they were actually siblings *wouldn't that be creepy as fuck?* No, he doesn't view her as a sister because no siblings would act that way towards each other. 


&gt; never done anything sexually with her and that people have never believed it and it has caused him friendship troubles before

This has caused him problems before and he *still* hasn't tried to do anything about it. Maybe you'll be the person that makes him realize he can't continue this type of ""friendship"" with her, but seeing as you already tried and things didn't change I'm not sure. 

They act like they're in a relationship. I don't care whether they have feelings for each other or not, because they act like a couple. You see it, they see it, their friends see it. She either has feelings for him or just enjoys the attention she gets from him and being his number one girl.

Honestly, I would not be okay with them sleeping over together, watching a movie alone in the same bed together, him calling her pet names, taking a bunch of pics together (with captions of ""My ____"" and hearts). In fact, if my boyfriend had a female friend who got pissed because he wasn't responding to her texts for a few hours I would be really concerned. 

If I were you I would tell him it's either you or her. If he wants to continue to talk to her then fine, but you shouldn't stay around. This is provided you even *want* to remain in a relationship with him. He's already proven that he's shit with boundaries. He's doing things that are obviously not okay. You've already expressed your concerns and instead of actually changing his relationship with her he started hiding it from you. Seriously? Does he have the *little* respect for you? Do he think you're *that* stupid?"" He would much rather continue on his relationship with her and make yours worse. You really need to consider if you want to stay with this guy because you don't deserve someone who treats you like that. What happens if he agreed to cut off contact with this girl and then a few years down the road you were suspicious of another female friend of his? Do you want to go through this again? If the first time you brought it up he was understand and respectful of it then I don't think it'd be a problem. He wasn't though.

If you end things you have to let him know that he either needs to start dating his friend, a girl who's poly, or a girl with no self respect and doesn't mind being treated like a doormat. No girl who gives a shit about herself (and wants a monogamous relationship) would be okay with him having another girlfriend. That's what she is, another girlfriend. "

xadriancalim,relationships,1390408322.0,"I think you're on the right track with having gone through therapy, looking to improve yourself, setting goals, being your own person, all that.  Just remember that no matter what happened in your past, what happens in this new relationship, or what will happen tomorrow or years from now, you're the only one that can make you happy.  You're the only one you can count on.  It's good to have a partner and it's amazing to feel that connection.  Just be mindful of yourself first.  Do what makes you happy.  You can slow down and think about your choices.  It's okay to be deliberate when it comes to your life.

As to your ex being gay, there's zero you can do about that, so it's not even worth thinking about.  He's in your past, his actions were his own.  Focus on you and focus on right now.  Every time you think something painful may rear its ugly head in your memory, do something positive right away.  Every time you fear something from your past, take a positive action, however small.  Soon those thoughts won't hurt as much and eventually won't even surface.  But always remember that you're not at fault for someone being gay (or not) or someone taking advantage of you.  It may feel like the power has been taken away, but the choice wasn't ever yours and you shouldn't feel like it was your fault.  That's almost no consolation, but use that going forward to understand that even in a happy relationship, you must look out for yourself first.  If it happens that you both want the same thing, that's when it's good for both of you.

Could part of the answer be found in the fact that many hockey players were raised in two parent homes with the income to support involvement in youth hockey? Also, two parent homes may have the resources to support the time commitment necessary for playing youth hockey.

This might be a stretch, but it might explain part of the lower rate of crimes committed by NHLers."

I have a 165 tall, and this tank.  If I didn't have the 165 at work, I would have loved to run this set up on this tank.  Seeing my 165 tank from the side profile makes me realize how much more space there is on the ground, [however - in the words of Boromir](https://imgflip.com/i/6bb1d).  I do dream of a 220 gallon setup or similar one day if I am fortunate to own a home.  As a renter who had a 165 gallon tank on the third floor apartment who found out about This tank is currently sitting on 4 joists and 2 load bearing walls.  For the hopefully short term, I think I'm safe short of a bit of compacting/compression. 

This is my first dirted tank, trying my hand at dry ferts for the first time (burnt off 2 batches of 3 different kinds of vals - jungle, spiral, and ?? that are slowly recovering now) and I'm running CO2 24/7, and... [For lighting - Go big or go home for the altums.  324w T5 HO - 6x 48"" T5 bulb fixture off of amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Aquarium-Light-6x54w-Actinic-Fixture/dp/B006O2EY82/ref=sr_1_sc_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390401157&amp;sr=8-6-spell&amp;keywords=t5+ho+aquarium+lighting+6x+48).  I think it ran $200, I've seen 4x strips for more than this price.  Fixture comes with 6 or 8 blue LED moon lights also, all controlled by a central LED timer.  3 controls, 2 for each group of T5HOs, the third for the blue LEDs.  Couldn't be happier with that unit.  

I think the key is using a combination ferts, co2 and lighting.  Since I have a 165 gallon tall, 

I built a custom spraybar that runs the majority of the tank connected to a Fluval Fx5.  The spraybar itself is extended 4 inches forward from the front of the tank and has the majority of the outlets angled towards the top of the water, and I have 2 outlets towards pointed down towards the back of the tank in the center to avoid any possible dead zones.  

On top of the spraybar, I made a shelf of egg crate and glued Flame Moss (with some alien Christmas Tree moss that invaded from the donor tank), and that has grown like silly.  I recently used a zip tie as a needle with some 6lb test to ""sew"" and tie back the moss to keep it from floating on the top of the water and create some density.  Only problem is I believe there is too much light here as when I don't dose nitrates, I start to get BGA growing on the moss.  I also had the Manzanita branch covered in Flame moss growing BGA as well, as I had it directly below the waterline to rapidly fill out the moss.  I'm debating redoing the spraybar to fit the back of the tank, and making an identical shelf directly against the wall at a lower depth to help with the BGA as I have the lights resting on the hood directly and only ~3"" above the water. 

The problem with these tall tanks for me has always been getting enough light and I believe proper macro/micro nutrients.  Working with 30 inches of water really does a number on the strength of the light by the time it reaches your floor.  

Other biggest challenge with this tank was water changes.  the hood leaves the tank standing at 6'2"".  A step ladder pouring 5 gallon buckets into the water creates total chaos to all of the plants.  My solution?  I had  [this guy](http://www.amazon.com/TetraPond-26588-Water-Garden-Pump/dp/B002RBGFA4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390404545&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=1000+gph+water+pump) lying around from my growing out discus days and massive water changes/treating water.  I ran a 10' hose behind the tank and fixed to the top , and mix ferts/treat water in a 5 gallon bucket, and simply keep filling the 5 gallon bucket below with treated water.  Sucker is fast, but the water flow is directed, controlled and does not stir the substrate.  

Currently I'm trying to figure out how to once and for all end BGA.  I've been treating using H2O2 with a turkey baster, turning off the filter for ~5-10 minutes, and ""painting"" the affected areas.  When I do this, the pearling was pretty good at first, it then looks like I soaked a wound in peroxide.  Using a 3% solution, none of the fish appear to be impacted. I also backed the light cycle from 12/12 to 8/16 last night as well.  Beauty of the 2 timers for my light is that later I can try different intensities on the lighting - the 2nd array of lights can kick on and off in the middle of the ""day"", making the photoperiod less intense.  

As to my test kit being bunk, it was reading properly just 2 months ago when my tank was far less stable and freshly planted.  I have 2 or 3 test kits, maybe I'll try using another for nitrate to simply eliminate it as a possibility. 

What am I looking for on suggestions?  I've read a ton, but maybe some help with BGA with this background, some tips for vals with regard to dosing KNO3 and having them thrive?  Red plants, stemming tall and something to help with a focal point towards the right side of the tank... Currently I'm not too crazy with the Bamboo plant I have there as the red fades the taller it gets...

If  he truly loves you, he would tell her to act civilly and accept you, or she won't be seeing him or her grandchild.

Unfortunately, you can't force him to do that. If I were you, I would have a talk with him and tell him you feel like he should stand up for you at the very least. He is choosing you to be his wife and mother of his child. Part of that job comes with requiring other people to treat you with respect. But don't make it an ultimatum. 

But I think that's the only way to handle this. He has to tell his mother that what she's doing is unacceptable and that if she chooses to do that, she *will* lose all of you. Then she's the one pushing him away, rather than you stealing him away. 

The most important thing is that your child not be around someone so manipulative.

But I would be very concerned that after 5 years, he's still letting  her insult you like this. He should have done something way before now. "

This is why i've gotten such mixed reactions from posts on reddit, like when i said 'i wish be had a group option' so that i could tell who my friends were because realistically i should be able to but the game fails to give me the situational awareness i need..

Sure i got a ton of upvotes but some people got REALLY mad at me because i should 'learn to tell people apart' and 'it's what makes DayZ tense'.. But these are the same type of people that cite 'realism' as their excuse to denounce other ideas.

Like someone suggesting you should be able to check dead bodies to find out what killed them, and a little bit of text should come up. They were yelled down, except the game can't possible hope to simulate actually being able to tell what happened, visually, and certainly not on all graphics settings.

With Dissolve we can pretend that you will make it to turn 6 to drop Phenax -- but you aren't going to hit 6 straight land drops because you aren't drawing any cards. And you definitely can't counter any of those  T4, T5 spells if you are tapping out for Traumatize or Liliana of the Dark Realms.  

As /u/beve21 said, you need to drop Duskmantle for removal. I'd go even further and recommend cutting all of Liliana, Traumatize, Triton Tactics, and Frostburn Weird for more removal and card draw.

Now with the benefit of WAR we see that Bonds averaged 8.4 WAR a year from 1990-1998 while Griffey- the incredible player that he was- averaged 6.0 WAR (BR WAR).

Then again, those payment restrictions imply the biggest hurdle; how do you get people to pay for a game that can't be made unbalanced by the things you buy with real money? LoL has a great money system; people who spend real money are at no greater advantage (except possibly through runes) than those who spend only IP.

banana-tree,Turkey,1390409210.0,"I'm not going to debate semantics, numbers or sources here, but I do want to make a point to make my stance clear. I personally think the word genocide is inaccurate, anachronistic, and too loaded to be conducive to a meaningful discussion at this point. However, I see people whitewashing and justifying the massacres and relocations entirely in attempts to refute the claims of genocide, and that I can't stand.

There was no 'choosing to return' for Armenians, as their land and property was given away to Turks and Kurds. Their decision to stay in Syria wasn't because they fell in love with their comfy camps and sweet money rolling in from hefty Ottoman funds.

You talk about some Ottoman funds as a generous gesture. The Armenians were ripped of all their fortunes (ordered to leave all their belongings and bank accounts as is) as they embarked upon this lovely comfortable journey that you paint, towards their 'new lives'. I also happened to have just been reading ([here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/NewRepublic-1920mar31/12-19/)) that around a million people in the US have donated to Armenian relief funds by 1920. So it wasn't the Ottoman generosity that saved whatever lives that were saved.

I don't even care that much about state responsibility when it comes to the massacres (the financial part is another matter), whether they were directly ordered, enabled or just tolerated (I actually find the latter more terrifying, as it means people were to blame, instead of a past government or a few pashas). It's disturbing that people can point to Armenian gangs killing Turkish civilians as justification for relocating an entire population, and then talk about the massacres of Armenian civilians in such a matter-of-fact manner. 

Regardless of what you call them, they were crimes as abominable as when the sides were reversed. They were committed by grandparents of people we live with. Some of the sentiments that caused the massacres can still be seen in some current slogans, attitudes and policies. That's where the danger lies, and that's what makes whitewashing the massacres (and the relocations too) in a discussion of semantics extremely dangerous."

Agree to disagree, there. Schaub is a 2X Pro Bowl player, if he can play as well as he has in the past again, I think that will be better than what we get from Bridgewater. I mean, look at the Jets and the Bills with Geno Smith and EJ Manuel last year...those guys are better comparisons to Bridgewater than Luck or RG3. 

Hoping a rookie QB can have a pro bowl-caliber season is a much longer stretch than hoping a proven pro bowler can get back into that form, at least in my mind.

MBorkBorkBork,Parenting,1390409268.0,"You're absolutely right, about that not being fair. If I had *only* that text to go on, that's the assumption I'd make (and did make), but the truth is, I know that venting happens. I do think most childcare workers' priority is taking the best care of the kids in their charge. So, a question for me is, does their assessment, definition, and practice of ""best care"" equal mine?

I'm a mom, and have been a nanny and preschool teacher. I know that meeting individual kids' needs is messy and difficult. BUT because of my philosophies and beliefs about raising kids, I'm going to put meeting their needs first, before efficiency and ease.  


&gt;the realist in me understand that it's unfair for any one child to monopolize the attention of the caregivers.

I don't use the word ""fair"" when dealing with kids. Their needs and personalities are SO individualized, I can't look at things through that filter. Sometimes one kid's needs are going to be much more, and immediate, than the other kids. I owe it to that child to give them the care they need. Like I said, it can get complicated and difficult - but I believe the sense of stability and security each child gets from that approach makes it worth it.

There was a girl in my preschool class who was inconsolable about missing her mom. The director and I talked to her mom about keeping her home; it was very clear she wasn't ready to separate. The mom was working during preschool hours, though, and needed care. So for a while, I gave as much individualized attention as I could to that little girl. I brought a sling to work to carry her in, and doted on her. While caring for the other kids, as well. Within a week and a half, she was secure and happy in the classroom, and able to separate more easily from her parents. 

So, during that time, it wouldn't have looked ""fair"" to the other kids, that I was carrying her, holding her on my lap during story time, playing with her on the playground. But, for the most part, the other kids were really OK with it. If one of them had needed more, I would have gotten the director or a parent volunteer to come in to help. 

The class running smoothly wasn't a huge consideration for me. Caring for each child, to the best of my ability, was. Which, in the long run, helps things run more smoothly.

mkvgtired,syriancivilwar,1390409300.0,"That being said, the PKK does do some nasty stuff. They opened fire on an American expat out east. They have bombed public places. They have specifically targeted tourists. 

The Kurds were some of the friendliest people I've met. I can see why they've turned away from Turkey. Adding to the list you've made, the Turkish police would randomly search homes in the middle of the night. they would severely restrict movement of people. I met a guy who spent a week in jail with a New York Times journalist for trying to drive to Batman, despite having the proper credentials from Ankara do to so. The Turkish army general that stopped them told him ""he is the law"" out there.

The PKK provides services to Kurds that Turkey doesnt. So a lot of people out there think very highly of them. That said, according to the PKK, I would have been a legitimate target for having the audacity to visit Turkey. I asked several people who were praising them up and down if they thought terrorism is ok. They all said no. But clearly the good the PKK does for them cancels out the terrorist activities they also do in their minds. Its a similar situation with Hezbollah in Lebanon or Hamas in Gaza. 

I guess that should be a lesson to Turkey. They could get much more public support if they'd start offering simple services to people out East. Instead of trying to economically choke them, try to get them up to the standard of Western Turkey. The PKK would probably lose quite a bit of support if they did. "

Im guessing you guys are American, as far as how strongly you react to the pill. I have NEVER been with a girl, who didnt take the pill and didnt want to take the pill. I wouldnt demand of a girl to take the pill, if she didnt want to take it, thats not really an issue, we would just never develop a relationship.

Ive hooked up with my girlfriends before we got involved, one way or the other, the pill comes up. If she refuses to take it, I would know not to pursue the relationship further, as the sex wouldnt work for me.

If it's a group plan, it should be the same rate for each employee in a given ""group"" - IOW, everyone who is single/no children pays the same, all that are married/no children pay the same, etc.

## Opening Positions Analysis

Bang on. For a permanent solution, we need to bring in Pujara, and he must be to replace Rohit. Let's come to the other opener's slot. I've always had a doubt on Dhawan and Rahane, and I was only 50-50 on Rahane but I was pretty sure this is what would happen to Dhawan. Nonetheless, in my opinion we need sureties not hopes for the next world cup. It's too late to try Chand, and may be too early to try Samson and Aparajith. We're not going to have another 22 year-old that Virat was for us in the previous world cup. My only other hope is Gambhir. Dude's a fighter, but not convincing, but at least better than Dhawan overseas.

## The #3 Spot

Virat is Ponting on steroids. Dude's a fucking champ! Probably the best no.3 we've had in ODIs.

## The #4 Spot

Rahane should either open as you suggested with Pujara or he should be the no. 4. Good thing is, I see him improving. Plus point about this number 4 is he's got better technique than Yuvraj. He needs to do what Virat did for us in 2011.

## The #5 Spot

Should be Dhoni. He's too good a limited overs player to not come in early. He also likes to take some time, so this is a perfect slot for him as we saw today.

## The #6 Spot

Raina, IMO, is a good no.7 who can slog it out, but we need a good combination of a striker+decent-batsman here. Basically another one like Dhoni. May be Rayudu? I've no fucking idea who can fill in this spot. No.7 is too much for Jadeja. I really hope we find a miracle for this spot. Rishi Dhawan, can he do that?

## The #7 Spot

Raina, for the reasons mentioned above. Plus the fielding.

## The #8 ~~Spot~~ Member

A proper fast bowling all rounder. Rishi or Binny seem to fit the bill. Well may be not Binny, but I've no idea about Rishi. All my guesses are on based on hearsay. Is he a hard-hitter like Binny or a proper batsman? If I see him in these ODIs, it will be great, but right now I'll just have to go with a proper bowler in Aaron or some flavor of the month (hence member instead of the batting position).

## The #9 ~~Spot~~ Member

Jadeja. I know we all have a huge hardon for Ohja, but sorry guys, not in the ODIs. Jadeja can do just as good plus the fielding (keep in mind, I'm selecting a side for 2015). If we need more spin, we can ask Raina or someone.

## The #10 ~~Spot~~ Member

Bhuvi.

## The #11 ~~Spot~~ Member

Shami.

The full eleven:

* Gambhir, Pujara, Kohli, Rahane, Dhoni, I-don't-know, Raina, Binny/Rishi/Aaron, Jadeja, Bhuvi, Shami.

If Rishi turns out to be a proper batsman, the no.6 spot can be sorted out. Otherwise, we'll have to go with Aaron.

The eleven for the next game:

* Dhawan, Rahane, Kohli, Rayudu, Dhoni, Raina, Binny/Rishi, Jadeja, Bhuvi, Shami, Aaron. I'll go with Binny though because I don't know Rishi's batting and bowling abilities and I know Binny can bat and we really need a batsman at no.7.

For fun, I'll select the actuall eleven we're going to see:

* Dhawan, Rohit, Kohli, Rahane, Dhoni, Raina, Binny, Jadeja, Bhuvi, Shami, Aaron.

So yeah, I guess Ashwin and Ishant may be dropped, but don't be surprised if you see the same side again."

**EDIT**: It's like using a $100 bottle of red wine to make Sangria. It's going to taste exactly like a Sangria made with $9 wine because of all of the added sugar and juice. Making a Sangria with $9 wine, though, usually is less abrasive than one made with 2 buck chuck. In other words, it's a law of diminishing returns. The can also be argued about straight alcohol, but the dropoff in quality difference happens at a much lower price-point if you are mixing. "

TheFarnell,Quebec,1390409665.0,"Y'a plusieurs films québécois qui sont réellement excellents et que tu peux regarder sans même sortir de chez toi.  Comme le marché québécois est très petit, les auteurs ne peuvent pas se fier à d'énormes budgets d'action et donc l'écriture et la qualité des histoires est à l'honneur - et c'est une excellente façon d'explorer la culture québécoise.

**Starbuck**

De loin mon film québécois préféré, c'est une comédie sentimentale qui joue sur l'importance de la famille dans le monde d'aujourd'hui.  L'écriture y est excellente.

**Dans une Galaxie Près de Chez Vous**

Comédie absurdiste basée sur une émission de télé pour enfants, mais le film lui-même semble beaucoup plus axé sur le marché adulte.  Y'a beaucoup de méta-humour alors c'est peut-être plus pour quelqu'un qui connaît déjà bien la culture québécoise, mais c'est quand même très bon.

**La Grande Séduction**

Un peu Montréalo-centriste comme vision des choses, mais c'est un autre bon film qui fait tant de la comédie que du dramatique, et qui explore les changements culturels et économiques dans le régions tout en étant bien écrit et bien joué.

**Liverpool**

Un ""date movie"" avec un flair un peu plus artistique, j'ai aussi beaucoup aimé ce film, surtout pour ses plans d'angle et sa vision très terre-a-terre du crime et des technologies de communications au Québec.

**Le triptyque Denys Arcand:** *Le déclin de l'empire américain, Les invasions barbares, L'âge des ténèbres*

Ce trio de films suivent une certaine continuité, mais sont aussi des très bons films individuellement.  Ils sont un peu plus ""cinéma d'auteur"" que ""culture populaire"", et le dernier (L'âge des ténèbres) est un peu plus satirique, mais ils sont quand même très accessibles et fond une bonne expression de l'évolution du Québec dans le 25 dernières années."

I was put on the generic of singulair and both myself and my husband noticed I became really short tempered and bothered by things that never botheted me before. I was on it for 3 months because the allergist said to give it time to work on helping my sinus congestion. It wasn't working on helping with my sinuses and myself and my family weren't liking the angry me. About a week after I stopped taking it, I was me again! I'm 2 months free and no more angry.

If this has always been her reaction, then it is something she learned, probably as a child, as a way to cope with stress. Maybe see about getting a special bowl to put by the door that can be the, ""if I find your stuff, I'm putting it here before I forget to tell you I found it."" It can also be the place she also always puts her phone, keys, daily items. Help her make it a habit. 

My husband always forgot his phone, lunch or even his computer every day. I would run that list of, ""Do you have your lunch, phone, keys, computer?"" everyday. It eventually became second nature for him to run that list himself. Now he rarely forgets something. I blame his parents for not making him self sufficient.

It did help that he wanted to change. That he hates to be so forgetful. He's come a long way in improving his memory. But when his Mom did EVERYTHING for him, he never had to learn to keep track of stuff for himself.

The acknowledgement that I can chose to continue the conversation does not give me control over their social behavior.

It *does* show that they recognize that I have the option of engaging or not engaging. 

These ""even more forward"" messages that I didn't ask for:  don't acknowledge ""my characters"" preferences or possible preferences in the text, and also don't show any acknowledgement that I have the option of being interested or disinterest.

It is true that in this form, I absolutely have the option of ignoring them.

As somebody who has studied linguistics, the idea that descriptivism is inherently superior to prescriptivism isn't at all controversial among academics. Deferring to grammatical ""rules"" is pretty much just social custom-- there's no reason why it should be ideal to follow them as long as your intended meaning gets across to your audience. The thing is that over time it's become fashionable to defer to Strunk and White's definition of ""proper"" language, so people won't respect somebody who writes the way they speak in a formal setting. In reality language is organic and changes all the time. People are going to find a way to communicate whether it's by your rules or not, so I don't see why we should treat one grammatical prescription as superior to the ways of speaking that are actually in use. Clearly they are both just as workable if people understand both of them."

Everyone thinks Chase is great, including me, until Chase fucks them.  Specifically, they lied to me.

Had a credit account, ran up a balance of $4,000.  Late on payments 3x in 12 months, Chase jacked my interest rate up to ~25%.  I called them up to have them lower it and they said I had to make minimum payments on time for 6 months.  Up to this point, they were completely justified and *should have done exactly what they did*.  Now, I'm young and stupid and don't realize exactly how the system can work to my advantage.  I had been brought up to believe that you treat people honestly and fairly and you pay your obligations.  Because I messed up the account, it was only right that I paid the extra interest.  I religiously made my payments, even paying more than the minimum.  6 months of good standing later, I called Chase up, related the last phone call, and asked them to lower my interest rate now.  The person on the phone told me that the last person I spoke with was mistaken, and I had to make my payments on time for 6 more months before they would lower my interest rate (1 year total).  Okay, so I did that.  Called them up again six months later, related both conversations and asked them to lower my interest rate again.  They told me that my account had been closed 6 months prior, and that my interest rate was locked at the 25% until it was paid in full.  I told them there must be some mistake, that I had made all my payments as requested, and that they should honor what they told me during the last phone call.  They reaffirmed that there was absolutely nothing they could do and that my interest rate was locked.  Out of curiosity, I questioned whether my rate would ever go up again if I was late on any further payments, since my rate was *locked*.  They assured me that it would definitely go up, on the very next time I was late, to over 30%, but it would never, ever go down again.  That's not fair, and that's not honest dealing.  Lying to me is enough to destroy a relationship with me.  So, I opened a card with another bank and transferred the balance, vowing never to do business with Chase again.

Fast forward one year and Chase bought the bank to which I had transferred the balance.  I debated whether to switch to another bank, but decided that the previous situation had been started by me, was my fault, and if I paid on time Chase would never fuck me again, so I left the balance and made my payments on time.  Fast forward one year, life happened.  I was in the military, stationed in Japan, and about to separate.  The particular circumstances involved required me to leave my house and stay in a hotel on base for a month, transfer to a base back in the US, inprocess that base then outprocess from the military, about a ten day process, and then I left on my honeymoon for 1 week.  This was 2005, so my internet access would be inconsistent at best.  I paid all my bills before I left my house in Japan, checked 2 weeks later to make sure payments had all been received, then dealt with the rest of the things I was dealing with.  I came back from my honeymoon to find out that I had paid Chase 3 days before the *start* of the billing cycle, so they took that payment and applied the entire thing to the principal, and then I had not made a payment in the billing cycle, and so that one time I was late they jacked my interest rate from ~10% to around 25%.  I called them up and explained to them exactly what had happened in my life, pointed out that my payment had been precisely the same amount as my other payments and that my intent was obviously to have it applied to that billing cycle, and they absolutely, unwaveringly, did not give a shit about me, my military service, or my life and were unwilling to reapply that payment the way that I had intended or lower my interest rate.  They told me that if I wanted a lower interest rate I had to make minimum payments on time for 6 months.  *Fool me once...*

Obviously, in that circumstance I had made all my payments to all of my creditors outside their respective billing cycles, and only one other creditor even questioned what was happening, my credit union.  Instead of jacking up my interest rate, *they called me*.  I explained it to them and they said, “Oh, that makes sense.  We'll just reapply that payment to this billing cycle.”  Done.  Over with.  With that I took out a loan from my credit union, paid my Chase account off, and washed my hands of Chase bank for the rest of my life.

I have had other friends who know of my disgust with Chase tell me their own stories of Chase where they would get mysterious fees for no reason and sometimes Chase would jack up their interest rates a few percentage points *even when they were paying on time*.  I asked what their balance was at that time and they were always between $2,500 and $5,000.  I have no idea if that is significant, but it's the only correlation I have found.  Upon thinking about all these situations, it became clear to me that for Chase, the people banking with them aren't valuable relationships but rather profit centers where they could extract fees and raise interest rates.  Maybe they do need that new Ferrari, but I don't need to pay for it.

I have another friend who had his wallet stolen at a party that was near his house.  The thief used his Chase account at a store in the neighborhood that night for a small purchase, $20 or so.  The next day my friend called up all his cards and reported them stolen.  Chase, on their own, decided that because the thief had used the card at a store that my friend had also been to (because it was in his neighborhood), that my friend didn't have his wallet stolen, was trying to defraud Chase, and put him in Check Systems.  Boom.  My friend had all his other bank accounts and credit cards immediately closed on him and he can't open another account for something like 7 or 10 years.  He's trying to fight it now.  

You can find all kinds of horror stories about Chase online just by Googling.  Try “Chase ripoff” “chase scam” “chase evil” “chase predatory” or things like that and I'm sure you'll come up with a plethora of stories.  Take them for what you will.  For me, I won't deal with a financial institution that lies directly to me, and I don't want to deal with one that refuses to understand that I'm human.  I do everything I can through my credit union now because credit unions are amazing and aren't out to fuck you.  You're a member, not a profit center (the profits go back out to the members)."

You can eat a 400 calories snack in 2 minutes, but to burn 400 calories on a treadmill or elliptical will likely take 30 minutes or more depending on how hard you push yourself.

In other words, it's *easier* NOT to eat the 400 calories than it is to burn it.  To lose a pound a week you either cut 3500 calories (500 less) per day or you burn 3500 calories extra per week.  At 500 less per day, it would take an extra 40 minutes of exercising or 280 minutes more effort.

I think most people would not say they have 280 minutes extra to spend doing something they don't normally do."

The worst thing they can do is inundate the champion pool with fluff meta-promoting champions and take away from existing pool's innovation and flexibility. Champions like Thresh and Leona, although extremely well designed and executed, nearly nullify their competing choices in lane, and they're on the newer end of the spectrum. Why not focus on making your existing pool more relevant? I love what they've done with Soraka and Taric, but there's still more to do. So when they look at their focus and budget distribution, I think the entirely playerbase would be better served by reworks, updates and modernizations. "

ljak,DebateReligion,1390410274.0,"As the response to this thread demonstrates, saying that ""atheism is armchair theology"" gets you into the problem of defining atheism. Most atheists define it simply as a lack of belief in god/gods (which are in themselves ill-defined concepts), resulting in too broad a group for an anthropological study. For example, the average redditor has very little in common with a rock, but both are ""atheists"".

Instead, I would suggest that you examine specific groups of atheists. In the late 20th and early 21st century, we are observing a rise of a demographic that shares a certain attitude towards religion. They are influenced by a small group of authors like Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens (and to a lesser extend philosophers like Daniel Dennett), and tend to be very strong materialists and empiricists (in past centuries, many atheists were rationalists, or just people who weren't interested in religion).

I believe that this group of people (not all atheists) can be accurately described as ""armchair theologians"" in that they tend to have a rather poor knowledge of philosophy and theology but still engage in heated arguments on the topic. They often seem to look up or memorize rebuttals to simplistic versions of various theological arguments, which are almost always effective against the average theist, who also knows very little about theology or philosophy.

I think in my situation, it's more useful to compare the D5100 and the D7000 to my D40 rather than to each other, and then consider how expensive upgrading to each camera would be.

| | D40 | D40 =&gt; D5100 | D5100 =&gt; D7000 |
|:-:|-:|-:|-:|
|**MP**| 6.1 | +10.1 | ~~+0~~     
|**Sensor Type**| CCD |  CMOS | ~~CMOS~~ 
|**Max ISO**| 1600  | +24,000 | ~~+0~~
|**Max Shutter Speed**|1/4000|~~-0~~|-1/8000
|**AF points**|3|+8|+28
|**Still FPS**|2.5|+1.5|+2
|**Screen Size (inches)**| 2.5  | +0.5 | ~~+0~~
|**Screen Res. (dot count)**| 230,000 | +691,000 | ~~+0~~
|**Video**| no | 1080p/30fps | ~~1080p/30fps~~
|**Built-in Mic**| no | yes | ~~yes~~
|**Vari-angle Screen**|no|yes|~~yes~~
|**Autofocus D lenses?**|no|~~no~~|yes
|**Exposure Dials**|1|~~+0~~|+1
|**Viewfinder**|pentamirror|~~pentamirror~~|pentaprism
|**Upgrade Cost? (new, $)**|-|+360|+340

So I don't think the D7000 is worth it for me. I can get a D5100 for $360 (new), minus the $100 something that I can get from selling my D40. 39 AF points is great, but going from 3 to 11 will feel good enough. I'm ok with missing out on the faster shutter speed, the extra exposure dial, and the higher still frame rate. Again, going from 2.5 to 4 will feel good enough. I don't need an internal focus motor. I'm fine with sticking to lenses with the AF built in. 

In conclusion, I can get a **new** D5100 for net price of ~$260 (selling my D40), or I can get a **new** D7000 for a price of about $600. I don't think that the benefits of the D7000 over the D5100 are worth 340 dollars. "

bubbish,malehairadvice,1390410389.0,"I do in fact have some knowledge about glasses. Got myself a nice pair this summer. I splurged and went to a more high-end shop where they have specialists, because I know there's a bit of science with face shapes involved. I don't know much but I do know that the shape of the glasses' rims has to fit stuff like eyebrows and forehead. I also know rounder glasses make noses appear bigger.

The girl in the shop gave me a few tips and had me try 6-7 glasses. I went home with 3 on loan, and decided on one of them. The ones I chose sort of felt right even from the start, I just compared to others to be sure about it. The store people didn't help me as much as I'd liked in the shop, but I came off with nice glasses anyway.

I'd advise you not to focus on a certain brand or style. I actually also went in looking for cool RayBans but I found none I liked. Instead I got another brand on the same price level. Just look around and try many glasses on until you find something which 'pops'. And ask for a lot of help, if the shop is good the will have people who know shit about face shapes and whatnot. Prescription glasses are expensive (at least in my country) but you're gonna have them for many years so I'd suggest to spend some money there."
chrisonline1991,self,1390410392.0,"&gt; To the answer, though, these are types of laws and common categories used throughout history to define why laws were put in place. Civil laws are societal laws, Ceremonial are usually referred to as traditions, and moral laws are where we get our concepts of right and wrong.

I don't think you answered my question.  Saying it's common sense just puts a lot more burden on you to prove that it is common sense. Even if it is common sense, explaining what you mean is required.  It's required so all parties can know what is really being talked about.  I still am unsure of the terms you used here.

&gt;Because it is no longer our society's desire to consider long hair on men unseemly, or woman speaking out of turn improper. Society's change, civil laws change. Who would consider every civil law ever made to still be in place? We don't follow Mesopotamian or Roman laws. We have our own.

I agree, i'm just suprised to hear this from a theist.  If you are consistant, then a lot of the bible is moot.

&gt; Righteous typically means with rightness. Meaning, if it's right to do so. Right, at least by Biblical standards comes down to moral judgement. Is it in protection of someone? Is it as punishment for wrongdoing? Flipping it around helps too: Is it in order to sate your greed? Your lust? Your hatred? Then you probably shouldn't.

I agree, however defining Morality would be important. e.g. Some Theists say being gay is immoral, they are wrong.

&gt; To an outside observer, yes. Biblically though, they are agreements the individual makes with God and vice versa. Generally figured out through prayer and the holy spirit. Either way, things not expressly forbidden in the Bible or go against the two rules of thumb are personal opinions.

I'm confused here.  Just because they are agreements with God doesn't mean they can't be opinions.

&gt;If you come at these rules of thumb from a perspective of a non-Christian, or person who isn't born-again then of course you'll find tons of possible loopholes to do whatever you want to do. That mindset, though, is childish to Christians who honestly want to do right by God and take a more balanced and common sense approach to our behaviors. 

I almost don't want to say anything to this because of our ridiculous it is. You somehow know that all Christians won't find loopholes? Then somehow know that all Christians what to ""do right by God"", which if assuming you've read the bible is incorrect. Then you say that all other approaches are not balanced and not common sense.

You seem to have set up definitions so that they match what you want to be true.  e.g. a ""true Christians"" wouldn't do [x], therefore if [x] is done by someone they aren't a ""true Christian""

&gt;So in conclusion, I feel like you seem to think there is-or want there to be-some sort of definitive list of every situation mankind faces written down in holy writ with a definitive YES or NO next to it made by some sort of deranged Santa Clause... And well, no. That's not how the world, or Christianity, works. We have guidelines, we have examples, and then we have the Holy Spirit to guide us while we try to live a more righteous life.

Throughout history Theism has been used to do immoral things, and they have been said to be moral because of theism. So of course i don't want a definitive list, but you bet your ass, i do what a better set of principles.

I honestly thought that you might have something interesting to say.  I notice now that i was mistaken and talking to you about this at any length will just be a waste of my time. It's very upsetting to me to see theists try and defend morality, because the simple fact is that theism, the bible, etc are not moral. I'm not going to argue the last sentence because anyone who doesn't understand that, isn't misunderstanding it because lack of evidence.

If users can generate their own content with mods (which is what PC enables), they have reduced revenue from re-releases with ""new"" content.

You can still play a PC game from 20 years ago on a current machine with the right settings, so there's no new sales.

Saying, ""the mafia"" is a bit like saying, ""cancer."" It's an unspecific umbrella-term. And in the case of ""the mafia,"" it implies a level of cohesion or unity that is not present. In reality, the Italian mafia refers to organized crime on a region to region basis. You have La Cosa Nostra in Sicily, La Camorra in Campania, etc, etc. You may have noticed that the article pointed out that Ndrangheta is Calabrese. These are independent criminal organizations with distinct, unique criminal cultures, activities, and philosophies. Referring to them collectively as ""the mafia,"" and then continuing to discuss their activities as if they are uniform and complementary, is fundamentally wrong.

I also don't remember this being a real option until the mid 90s, particularly at smaller, usually locally owned CD stores. Bigger stores like Specs in the mall generally didn't have this. So many shitty CDs I bought hoping the rest of the album would be as good as the one song I knew."
