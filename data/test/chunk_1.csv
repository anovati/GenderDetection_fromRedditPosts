IPtorrents is fairly easy to get into, and it's a bit like TPB for private trackers. It's a general torrent site. You should be able to easily get an invite for IPTorrents from torrent-invites.com

what.cd is a really good starter site. It's the best site for music, it's got an interview, and once you become power user (although that's fairly difficult) there's an invite forum that makes it easy to get into other private trackers. Only bad part about what.cd is it's super difficult to increase your upload. [Here's a link to the what.cd invite prep site](http://www.whatinterviewprep.com/)

Those are the two sites I'd recommend. That should cover about everything too. Music, movies, television, books, etc. There's private trackers specifically for each of those things that have very strict rules for uploads but they're quite hard to get into. Read around a bit. Keep it mind it might take a bit of effort to get into some private trackers. There's two I've been trying to get into for a few months now.

Reagansmash1994,todayilearned,1388589448.0,"You're broken.

The term 'edgy' is an adjective often used informally these days. Calling someone edgy (in the manner I did) is sarcastically highlighting that there is nothing cool or dangerous (edgy is used to describe tense situations or *""at the forefront of a trend; experimental or avant-garde.""* which you clearly think you are) about, in your case, going against the grain. You were just trying to be cool and not mainstream.

Thus, the manner in which I used the term 'edgy' was absolutely correct due to the context in which it was used.

&gt; The notion that a foodstuff so fundamental, so deeply ingrained in the human
experience, can be bad for us is, well, unsettling and counter to long-held cultural
views of wheat and bread. But today’s bread bears little resemblance to the loaves that
emerged from our forebears’ ovens.

&gt; […]

&gt; Bread and other foods madeof wheat have sustained humans for centuries, but the wheat of our ancestors is not
the same as modern commercial wheat that reaches your breakfast, lunch, and dinner
table. From the original strains of wild grass harvested by early humans, wheat has
exploded to more than 25,000 varieties, virtually all of them the result of human
intervention.

Why is $60 some magical number you refuse to pay more than?  What if, for example, Braid had been released as a $60 game? You'd be complaining that it was too short and didn't offer enough content to justify that price tag, right?

[Coconut oil](http://www.westonaprice.org/know-your-fats/new-look-at-coconut-oil) and [garlic](http://home.howstuffworks.com/garlic10.htm) both have antiviral, antibacterial &amp; anti fungal properties and can take care of ear infections (and other types of infections) no problem.

HolyGigi,confession,1388590193.0,"I call bullshit on this! 

I'm a guy, 29, in a relationship for over 7 years. I had a chance to cheat on my girlfriend with someone else - basically a one night stand. She was really hot, but I didn't because I love my girlfriend. 
If I were to sleep with that other girl, it would've been entirely my fault if it ""ruined"" my life. Not hers. She didn't held a gun to my head and asked me to cheat. 

So no, I dont think throwaway7520 is ruining relationships. If the men with who she sleeps actually cared about their SO, they wouldn't cheat. It's that simple. Blaming her is dumb.    

@throwaway7520: do whatever makes you happy as long as your actions do not hurt others. If they agree to have a relationship with you even though they are married, that's on them. If the men wouldn't cheat with you, they would cheat with someone else.

&gt; What The F#ck?: Without any warning to the subjects, one of the researchers standing just behind them would fire off a .22 caliber starting pistol in the few seconds just before several of the maximal efforts.

&gt; Let me HEAR YOU!: When they reached their final maximal effort during the gunshot (“What the F#(*?…) trial, subjects were asked to shout as loudly as possible.

&gt; Get your Buzz On: After five baseline maximal efforts, these troopers drank a shot of 190-proof pure grain alcohol before the next 25 efforts.
&gt; Ultimate Pre-Workout: Subjects gobbled down 30 mg of amphetamine sulphate 25 minutes before a “blistering” 30-minute round of maximal pulling.

&gt; All Natural Pre-Workout: After five baseline pulls, they received an intramuscular injection of adrenaline and finished the rest of the maximal efforts.

&gt; Limitless Subjects were hypnotized: (No, they were not asked to quack like ducks or take their clothes off.) After five baseline pulls, they performed maximal efforts under hypnosis—during post-hypnotic suggestion (both when it was suggested that they were very weak and that they were very strong, respectively), and afterwards when awake and released from any hypnotic control.

Amonette2012,changemyview,1388590880.0,"I think a religion should only be tax free if it meets stern criteria. For example, a small church that plugs all the money it makes into local projects and simply maintaining the building is NOT the same as a massive send-me-your-money-and-I'll-pray-for-you-to-get-rich churches where the pastor has his own private jet. A lot of churches etc actually function in a similar way to a charity, supporting small projects in the community, providing a soup kitchen or respite centres, or simply supporting parishioners who are vulnerable, ill, elderly or alone - and I think they should be treated under rules similar to those for charity.

While I can totally see your point, in that churches shouldn't be able to make un-taxed profit that isn't spent on something deemed to be socially useful, changing the system in a way that didn't have the interests of the people that many religious institutions help at heart could be damaging to the wider community. I for one would hate to see a situation where religious organisations are forced to close their doors to the people who relied on them just because some people felt they didn't deserve their tax free status.

They could go murderhobo Black Crusade, or some other version of switching sides to Chaos. Then they'd be big public enemies, depending on how obvious their actions were.  

They could retire.  

They could hop on some merchant transport or sign on with a Rogue Trader. Then they could go halfway across the galaxy to where they aren't known. They could retire. They could change it to a Rogue Trader campaign. They could do their own thing elsewhere.  

They could be approached by the Tau to change sides and become Tau operatives and anti-Inquisitorial counter-intelligence.

- 11 mg O-Acetylpsilocin (pro-drug of psilocybin)

It's only been one week since I have done this trip but I really believe that the impact it had on me will stay for a long while. While tripping, the idea that schoolwork or work was different from leisure didn't make sense to me. I love doing math and statistics. I should be able to work on my thesis whenever I want just for fun. The problem is that I associate working on homework or my thesis with anxiety. Because I'm always afraid to not finish in time or fail at solving the problem and then I panic and stop doing any work for days and weeks, and I end up extremely depressed. So immediately after the trip ended I started working on my thesis. I've been working a bit everyday on my thesis since then. 

On another side, the trip made me realize that I really love my gf and that she's really important to me, so I must cherish that. Also, I realized that my situation is not as bad as I thought, I'm doing what I really love, I have a great gf and I'll definitively be able to live fully as women and pass 100% in due time (I'm transgendered). It's just gonna take time and some money but I'll definitively be the scientist woman that I really want to be.

Now my mind feel more at peace but my body still react annoyingly by giving me anxiety sometimes and also I sometimes get the reflex to say in my own head stuff like ""I hate myself"" or ""I want to die"" but immediately I say ""that's not true, you're a great person, don't say such things' and I prevent myself from going super depressed."

blackinthmiddle,politics,1388592326.0,"&gt;All the people getting CS degrees right now are going to find themselves in the same boat.

I know I'm late to the party, but I **seriously** doubt that! I work as a web developer for a major media outlet. More and more, we're moving everything online. Everyone is realizing cost savings by moving everything online. There's countless billions of lines of code already in production. Who's going to maintain that code? 

Nowadays, you're not even considered a legit company if you don't have a website. The only threat was in '02, when companies thought they could outsource all programming jobs overseas. It was a struggle for me to find work at that time. Companies realized they were actually losing money doing this and now there's barely a week that goes by that I don't either get email or a phone call from a headhunter. Front end development. Back end development. The need for developers is great right now. 

There's no guarantees in life, but we are moving towards technology and the internet more and more. If there's one degree I *wouldn't* bet against, it would be CS. I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering. That allows me to get my foot into many professions. If you're worried about being too narrowly focused, try Engineering.

TheBestNarcissist,YouShouldKnow,1388592450.0,"I learned about this in undergrad biochemistry a few years ago! If I remember right, the key is to not take acetaminophen when you still have alcohol in your system because acetaminophen + booze helps catalyze your cytochrome P450s (the class of enzymes that break down foreign stuff, like drugs) to break acetaminophen down to the compound that messes with your liver. The combination is not so nice because alcohol ups the expression of the p450 enzymes. I think this is correct, but it might be backwards. Moral of the story, don't take acetaminophen before or during drinking. The morning after you'll probably be okay because the enzymes have been recycled, but best to be safe and not take it.

The stats aren't what make them great, they're a representation of his well rounded, highly trained skillset, that cross pretty much every position.  *And that doesn't even get into what he does for a team on the defensive end.*  Can you really say his block and steal numbers give you even a hint of what a *phenomenal* transition defender, or weak side blocker LeBron is?  Because I don't think so.  The numbers don't tell the full story, they are the closest translation we have.

I understand that.  I appreciate that.  But he'll *never* be Jordan, and he'll never be Bird, and he'll never even be Reggie.  Appreciating greatness is not about denigrating others, dismissing accomplishments and resisting change.  I never want to have to explain to my child some day why *Jordan* is **JORDAN** and I don't want to have to explain why LeBron doesn't compare.  He's just different. 

Stats are not a weapon, they're a frame of reference.  Don't use data as something you wield, or lord over others.  Information is something you soak up, and if you're not constantly looking for more of it, you fail to understand what the fuck you're really talking about.  You're never going to ""get it"", no one really does.  Jordans numbers aren't what make him great.  They're a representation of the data we have that represents what makes him great.  "

mhblm,aww,1388592938.0,"This is where I have to point out that most fatal dog attacks in the US are from pit bulls, consistently every single year.

I personally love pits, and one of the nicest, sweetest, best-tempered dogs I ever kenneled was a pit bull. The truth is, a small breed is like a BB gun, while a pit is like a shotgun. Let me reiterate that I love both. But if you majorly screw up with a BB gun, you'll most likely get a minor scratch. If you majorly screw up with a shotgun, you're much more likely to hurt yourself or someone around you. *Of course* no one thinks anything of it when a small breed is aggressive. It bad from a dog trainer point of view, but it's hardly dangerous.

In short: a well raised dog isn't that dangerous. But a mildly mean pit bull is far more dangerous than the vilest chihuahua you ever saw."

It actually isn't glorious, it's just a link to an illustration of the problem and her saying it's wrong to be the butt of the joke.

expaticus,Fitness,1388592998.0,"&gt; I'd also like to mention that I am single with no kids. So that makes doing this much easier than those with families. Also worth noting is that I have very few friends anymore as I pretty much spend all my time at the gym or work. Most of my friends have given up on me. But I'm ok with it. I see they aren't really the best friends anyway.

This is a huge point to consider and it should not be glossed over. You can follow all of the instructions detailed by the OP, spend every evening preparing and cooking your meals for the following day, and spend all of your free time at the gym. The end result WILL be exactly what you said - no friends, no family, no social life. Why would any of your friends stick around if you can never make any time for them? This is also very unhealthy. 

There needs to be a balance in my opinion, which is why I absolutely don't agree with workout plans that call for planning every single meal, and every single activity of every day. The most important thing is that people find time to move their bodies and sweat at least a few times a week and to avoid fatty foods. Just my opinion.

Fizjig,childfree,1388593294.0,"The problem with being profoundly self aware is that you place your flaws on well lit pedestals in the museum of your life for the general public to see. As much as you may want to smash those relics into pieces instead you find yourself periodically dusting them off, and buffing them up to a new shine. 

Each new person that visits will see what you have so carefully displayed behind a wall of Plexiglas ego. They won't be able to touch what's inside, but they will comment on it, and show it to their friends.

It's a metaphor heavy analogy I know. I guess its it's my playful way of saying, ""Listen to what I mean, not what I say.""

What I learned is that my motives are not always pure, and that I can be a cold, calculated son of a bitch at times. 

When I first saw the woman it was from a strictly superficial standpoint. I was merely interested in her outward appearance. It wasn't from a lecherous, sexual point of view. It was more just admiration. 

When I realized that she was struggling I felt compelled to do something. Call it empathy if you will. I thought about Kitty Genovese. The woman who was murdered in New York in 1964 while 38 people watched, even after she cried for help. No one lifted a finger. That event resonated with me somehow. I never wanted to find myself being one of the 38. 

The more she told me the more I found myself relieved that it wasn't me. A strictly selfish perspective. It's not that I consider myself a selfish person. I can be when it comes to certain things. I tried to imagine what life with her must be like. I found myself sympathetic not to her, but to the men who tried to have a relationship with her, but couldn't get past the problems with her child. I believe I just identified with them more. It is a lot to ask of someone to not only foster a new relationship, but also take on the responsibilities of raising a child who is a danger to themselves and others. 

No amount of reflection on it has produced any other result than a clinical answer of no. I would not be willing to take on that burden. 

Maybe that means I haven't grown from the experience. If anything it just solidified for me my already firm beliefs on having children.

Reading through the comments I see a lot of things that I can't agree with, or that need to be clarified for me. 

The idea that this woman should have just had an abortion instead seems like a confusing point of view. Without physical defects there is no way she could have known that her child was going to have so many emotional, and educational challenges. Those are problems that show up developmentally well after the child is born. It seems many people jump straight to euthanasia as their first response. The problem is that is a slippery slope with no good end in sight. Camps like Auschwitz were founded on the very same idea. It also begs the question how do we make that determination, and who gets to make that decision for the rest of us. It's easy to sit on the sidelines and say these things, but we cannot know how this woman feels toward her child. 

Her situation is a terrible one. One I wouldn't wish on anyone, but I don't think anyone else has a right to determine the choices she makes in her life. She isn't shying away from the consequences of her actions. She is facing them head on with an amount of courage and determination that goes way beyond what I think most people could muster.  

I pity her. She would be offended to hear me say it, but its true. In the end I guess we just do what's best for ourselves and say, ""I'm glad it didn't happen to me.""

I would like to think she is more than just a cautionary tale. She seemed like a wonderful woman. In the end I think we could all strive to be more compassionate. We can all stand to learn something from her example.

mwuk42,Rowing,1388593780.0,"As a ""very advanced skier"", if you do plenty in technical terrain (such as mogul fields) for sustained periods (i.e., you Don't stop for a rest every dozen turns), the cardio, while probably not quite as high as usual, will probably suffice to avoid any sort of drop when you return. Also, earn your turns! Runs that are only accessible from traverses/climbs will have the cardio benefit similar to XC to get to the terrain, and then the terrain is usually enough to sustain some cardio exertion on the way down.

Basically, if you do challenging pieces without breaking every few turns, you shouldn't lose out much, but if you stick to easy stuff and are lazy about it you're gonna have a bad time. Downhill skiing can be brilliant exercise with the right intensity, but you have to make sure you're trying to make it so.

Edit: didn't realise you've already done the skiing. If you felt tired after a day, every day, chances are you shouldn't be too bad."

It gives me peace of mind. I keep a small knife for when out at bars and such. Often, I would imagine, should an encounter happen while leaving a bar it would be in closer contact. Additionally, my weapons are 100% for protecting my life and not for protecting my property. Someone engages me leaving a bar and asks for my wallet?

Later on during the party I came across her again and she told me ""please just let me suck on your penis"" literally out of nowhere and I drunkenly obliged. She blew me for like all of 30 seconds until her friend walked out on us, and I say ""out on us"" because this was happening on the front porch. Then she ran away crying and I went and passed out.

Two days later this girl managed to get my number from my friend's girlfriend and started texting me incessantly for a week. She left the guy she was engaged to for me. I'd had no clue she was engaged. I had no interest in her, though. She was kind of a drunken mistake for me. I tried to be nice (while still making it a firm no) but after the 4AM drunken voicemail I just texted ""please delete my number"" and never heard from her again.

FranzJosephWannabe,Fitness,1388594229.0,"Agree with the things mentioned below. You may also want to do some layering for really cold weather. That will keep you from over or under dressing. Underarmour or other compression clothing that can wick sweat on the bottom, something to cut the wind on top, and then maybe a fleece or something else to insulate in the middle for really cold days.

Don't forget a hat and gloves as well, at least for the beginning of the run. You may want to take the gloves off halfway during the run, and that's fine. Just stuff them in your pocket and keep going.

If it's REALLY cold, you might also want to wear a scarf or balaclava around your mouth to help warm up the air you're breathing. Cold air can feel like little daggers in your lungs, so it helps to warm it up a bit first. Like the gloves, you may want to stop that halfway through your run if it's not that cold, but just do what feels good.

When you first walk outside, you should probably feel a little chilly, as your body temp will go up when you are running. If you're feeling like you're nice and warm and could be sipping a cup of cocoa, STOP IT and take off a layer. Just like you don't want to be too cold, you also don't want to overheat.

Another thing you should be aware of during cold weather runs is to keep hydrated!!! Sometimes when you're running in the cold you don't think about it as much as when you're sweating out in the heat, but it's just as important to stay hydrated.

edit: Of course, none of this is hard and fast, just do what feels right! Just for example, this morning I ran in about 40°F (4°C) weather and wore a hat, gloves, Underarmour shirt, sweatshirt on top of that, and running shorts (no compression pants). I felt perfectly fine once I got running. Took my gloves off about halfway through and stuffed them in the sweatshirt pocket. In the end, it's up to you what you wear."

Lots of people genuinely care for others and doing hard work is much more rewarding when you're not essentially forced into it, like in the case of taking a job for stability over one you would prefer to do, even if it's considered hard work to others.

Ritual sacrifice was probably not done in malice either (most of the time), whether it was of humans or of animals. Yet this is often considered cruel too by todays educated society. In fact I think the very reason that such ceremonies ended (or became symbolic) is because of increased knowledge and the fact that they did end is indicative of them being based on misinformation rather than malice. Much like today with circumcision.

However the sacrificed are still dead, and the foreskin is still cut off of non consenting infants. The procedure is barbaric, uncivilized and needless, and it's perpetuated by misinformation. It's easy to not make this mistake yourself simply respect the bodily autonomy of your future child. Tip: find out how much the procedure would cost, wait until your son is around 15-18 and tell him that he can either have this money or have the tip of his penis cut off and see what he chooses.

There will be a time soon when all his friends will start drinking, and he will want to try some, so my advice will be to just let him try a glass or so at home with dinner, and if he goes out and you think there will be alcohol offer to buy him some, so you can control his intake and make him promise he won't drink more.

**Pros:**

* Much higher overall stats. See www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1tawyu/psa_the_order_to_add_ascended_celestial_gear_for/

* An efficient way to get Critical Damage in Armor and Weapon slots without giving up a lot of stats. Those slots usually have bad Critical Damage ratios (amount of stats lost for 1% of Critical Damage gained), but the Crit Damage ratios for Celestial Armor / Weapons are very good.

**Cons:**

* Only works in some builds. Most people do not benefit from using Celestial gear.

* It can be a bit complicated to understand and use properly. Using too much of it will prove detrimental to your overall strength. 

Celestial is amazing for builds like the one I use and when you use it correctly it is very strong. It allows you to get high Critical Damage without giving up precious stat points like you would with Berserker Armor / Weapons."

I've done an excellent job of avoiding that lifestyle, and so have almost all of my friends have.  Still, sometimes friends of friends, or old friends from high school are involved in that type of lifestyle.  It's not a matter of standing up for yourself, I've done that plenty of times.  It's about leaving it behind, moving beyond and above it.  You move away, you stop talking to people, things get better.  But sometimes these people just pop back up, and then you dodge them again.

Instead of fighting back I was peacefully calm, just letting it all go.  I think that unsettled him and made him realize I was serious.  

He waited a long time after that for me to change my mind and it never happened.  Hard to get turned into hard to want, bend gave to break.  I was a loving, faithful and caring wife, and by all rights he is a very good man.  He just shut the world out and me with it, neglecting me as his wife, lover, friend, etc.  Had he chose a different course we might still be together

Regardless, I have no regrets.  We have a child together and get along very well.  He attends family functions, we send meals to each other's houses, sit together at our kid's sporting and concert events, etc.  I feel blessed that we have remained friends because I love the man and consider him family regardless of our ex status.

She eventually got away and applied for a divorce and met my (sweet, awesome, very chill) dad and had my sister and I. Bad part is that my other siblings still invite him over and are all like ""ohh dad! I can't stay mad at you!"" and ""forget"" to tell my mom that he's at their houses when she goes over.

snobord,pics,1388595314.0,"I agree with you that DUI laws and enforcement are maybe harsher than they need to be, but I have little problem with them. The fact of the matter is, no one NEEDS to drink, let alone drive drunk. Sure, the risk of actually killing our injuring someone is not as high as MADD and law enforcement would have you think, but there's really no benefit to legalizing it but there are a lot of potential negative consequences. I think the best analogy is to firing a gun in the air. There's very little risk the bullet will actually injure or kill someone when it comes down, but there's no real benefit to doing it while the potential negative consequence is killing someone. In the case of basically no benefit vs risk killing someone, I have no problem outlawing activity that has essentially no benefit if there is a risk of killing someone even if that risk is tiny.

As for the conviction ruining someone's life, again, no one HAS to drink and the only person that can be blamed for that ruined life is the person that CHOSE to drink before driving."

I hate silence, because as soon as there is silence, my tinnitus starts up. I'm not sure if they are related, but as I have [sensorineural deafness] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss), it probably is (missing/damaged nerves that carry the sound signals - my ears themselves are perfectly working; which is why I can't get the implant)

I probably have the biggest music collection of a deaf person ever, because I can't stand the tinnitus, I'm 23 and you never get used to it. I always have music on in the background to kill it off, I even had to have special rooms at school for exams with background noise or I couldn't concentrate.

Einmensch,headphones,1388595388.0,"This, the best audio-grade DACs (low speed, low THD+N, high resolution) out there cost a few bucks maximum in bulk. For that you get specs that are absolutely insane such as SNRs greater than 110 dB and THD that is all but non-existent. Tack on a nice shiny metal enclosure that feels solidly built, a solid PCB, and the rest of the components necessary for the whole unit to perform up to spec and I doubt it's more than $20-$30 in bulk. Add on NRE costs, manufacturing, QC, manufacturer profit, reseller profit, S&amp;H, and RMAs and $100 is decent price point. Beyond that you're getting ""premium products"" whose price is determined by what is necessary to convince people that it's really better than the cheaper alternatives. 

Edit: source: I'm studying electrical and computer engineering and for fun sometimes I price out the devices that I want to make or have made for different classes to figure out what they would end up selling for.

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1388595419.0,"Ok, people mentioned issues that annoy them like patriarchy, male privilege, etc. Without assuming hostility from these concepts, I think some feminists are just trying to illustrate issues that need to be dealt with, but how they phrase things comes across as implying, or outright saying, all males have net privilege, when that is clearly not reality. Whenever a person says or implies ""all"" or ""none"", ""always"" or ""never"" one automatically needs only one case to prove them wrong. Thus their argument has a weak foundation, or even none at all.

Toxic masculinity is a real thing I personally have seen as a man. That does not mean all men are toxic in their masculinity. That does not mean all masculinity is toxic. But some speakers just don't clarify that ""this is sometimes a problem"". They imply that it's always a problem.

Yes there are extremists out there, especially on the internet. If one assumes the internet represents the real population as a whole I think one would be mistaken. HOWEVER, since more people, especially younger people, get the majority of their information from the internet, the extremism SEEMS to be mainstream. And that's the misconception I've tried to mention several times. And it would be helpful for people to fix this misconception by taking action. 

Now back to baiting. I don't think the definition of ""baiting"" is real clear and people might react emotionally and report a comment or question as baiting. So I can see some problems moderating these consistently.

The only way I can watch it legally would be to either A; Pay for a subscription to a channel that I watch nothing else on. B; Waiting for the dvd release of the season (which comes out not to long before the next season starts). There is no other way to watch the show because HBO is very reliant on subscriptions.

For music I just have to say I have never had a good experience listening to Pandora, or any internet radio format for that matter. And also you are assuming that others are like you and don't listen to much music. I am a big music lover. I also listen to a lot of foreign and small-time bands that don't always come up on subscription sites. 

There's also the fact that there aren't that many good recovery programs if something happens to your music collection on your computer. I've had two computers just die on me before with thousands of songs that I did pay for, for the most part, and I'm not going to re-spend that money.

And guess what; I'm broke. I love music. I will pay for music when I have the cash available but it's not going to become another bill for me and for me it's not really an option to just not get it. I support bands when I can and I do buy cds and merch from bands I love."

but either way there is absolutely nothing wrong with a guy paying for everything and treating his girl or woman to gifts/presents or treats to his hearts content.

but equally there is nothing wrong with him dumping her like a stone if she gets fat, or ages badly, or something better comes along, or for any petty miniscule reason the guy feels like.

Women who think that somehow the guy ""Owes"" them or should be footing the bill on anything other than an equal partnership cant ever complain when the ""buyer"" changes his mind.

If you act like a product or service, dont be surprised to be treated like one

one of the pleasures of ageing is you see real world first hand all these women (and sometimes men) who have really high opinons and expectation of what they deserve only to be left broken and miserable when they lose their ""customers"" to a better younger more attractive service lol

On paper, I like the concept of Side A and B separating the introspective tracks from the more ignorant, party oriented tracks, however, it could have done without it. I feel like it might have been better if he mixed them up better to maintain interest, even though i like the album its hard to listen to it start to finish in one sitting. It's probably for that reason that i've listened to (and preferred) Side A more than B.

The overall sound i was hearing through some of this album sounded really unique to me, or at least drawing from some electronic subgenres i'm not very acquainted with.

Sure I appreciate the skill in which the actors preform, and the photographers shoot, and the writers write.  But I genuinely think it should be required viewing in every classroom, to show the massive breakdowns in the bureaucratic mess we are presented with today.  David Simon is a humanist, and watching The Wire, then The Corner, reading his books... it was all important to me, and something I evangelize because I had never seen anyone actually care to tell these stories, and do them so well.  Simply put, he talks about the parts of society we'd all rather move on from, move past and ignore (myself included).  He slams the reality of it in our life.  Read any of his recent essays, about the two Americas we live in today... to understand the world he speaks of is the closest anyone can get to understand what poverty and the war on drugs has brought on America, and our communities.

we have the technological capability to house, feed, and support every human being on this planet. we can build robots specialized to any labor task. but when we do build robots, instead of using them to serve the many, they're put to use serving the profits of the few, or the military.

for the most part the world is just hung up on this idea that everyone has to work, while we still spend most of our time figuring out how to shrink the pool of manual human labor jobs with automation an algorithms. wealth is such a silly thing, it boggles my mind that the main driving force behind humanity is the simple desire to have more than someone else. ""they must have less than me."" ""they must BE less than me""

it sounds great, if you're on top or have a job at a comfortable wage. and corporations would happily just keep cutting back human labor and wages until they no longer exist, and then they'd be confused to the point of total retardation because they wouldn't be able to figure out why nobody has money to buy their shit they keep trying to sell.

A lot of my family believe I'm named after Whitney Houston, but my mom said it's from the Cosby Show (however, Whitney is not a character on the show). But Whitney Houston was offered a lead role, which she turned down. WHO KNOWS! 

I have named NO humans in my lifetime.

I have named many inanimate objects and several non-human things in my lifetime.

Inanimate Objects:

* My first car = Beast (an old '89 Pontiac Grand Am LE)
* Probably a few toys from when I was younger
* Many, many character names (I have like 9 characters in WoW and a million others in other MMOs) 

Non-human things:

* Hamsters = Buddy, Buddy 2, Phil &amp; Lil
* Bird = Sky
* Dog = Roxie
* Cat = Kumo

danhakimi,Android,1388596052.0,"&gt; Oh no, her smartphone will be a couple years out of date when she's a couple years older! End of the world.

Are you necessarily going to want to buy your child a phone plan two years after you buy her her first device? A four year old phone is pretty shitty, and she'd probably be better off if you bought a cheaper non-phone first and used the money you saved to buy her a newer, cheaper phone four years down the line... depending on the deals you have available to you.

&gt; No, I'm suggesting the purchase of an affordable off-contract phone

So... not an iPhone? You know your children might hate you, right?

&gt; We've hit a point where phones 2-4 years later aren't going to be exponentially better than phones now.

We've hit that point a few times already, only 2-4 years afterward, we realized we were wrong.

People are speculating the exponential growth has to stop soon. It's pure speculation, and by all measures, exponential growth is still happening.

Also, remember that a four year old iPhone probably won't get the latest version of the OS. It might be two or even three versions out of date.

&gt; And I'm sure everyone has a hand-me-down phone or two they could potentially spare instead.

Then why not look for one of those now? Especially if your child is younger and cares less now."

JayMayo,tall,1388596056.0,"Hi Swooopp.

Personally I have measured myself in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening just to get an idea of how much my height changes. Since I use the metric system, I realized I lose about 3 cms during the day. I think I top out at 195 cm in the very early morning, and then decrease to 193 by the evening. This is why I use 194 in my flair, I figured it was a good compromise between my morning height and evening height. 

I have also tried measuring myself with my sneakers on, just out of curiosity to see how much they add. I don't wear boots or any other 'tall' footwear but I still gain 2 cms from regular shoes. 

I remember one morning a shorter co-worker asked me if I was 2m tall. I laughed saying ""No, I'm just 194"" but then I realized in the morning, with shoes on, I do get to about 197 cm so 200 cm isn't that bad of an estimate if you see me near a door frame (usually 205 cm here, or so). 

But I don't like cheating so I say 194 cm or 6'4"". Since a lot of guys round it up and use their maximum height, I could easily claim 6'5"" since it's kinda what I am in the morning, but I don't, in my opinion a legit 6'5"" is 6'5"" even in the afternoon. And unfortunately I drop out of the 6'5"" zone fast. So I would call myself a strong 6'4"" and that's what I claim. 

It annoys me when guys add inches to their height and exaggerate, I find it ludicrous, so that's why I don't even add 0.5 to mine. 

And I think the 'omg-that-guy-is-taller-than-me-wait-hes-shorter-damn' phenomenon happens to all tall people. I remember meeting a friend of mine's friend and he was skinny as hell and looked 6'7"" as he was walking towards our table. I was sitting down, he also sat down and I was convinced he had 3 inches on me at least. When we stood up, I realized he was a 6'2"" at best. "

The footage can feel too sharp - it can be uncomfortable to watch, but you my not know exactly why (if you don't know what you're looking at).

&gt; Do you agree the brine shrimp gambit is fallacious? 

The speaker's argument has invalid assumptions. Brine shrimp ""from the wild"" are not sold often because it is too expensive to  gather them. ""Sea monkeys"" are raised in large vats and their eggs are collected. Sea monkeys have a minor genetic change done by people, so they can be patented and are legally not the same as ""brine shrimp"". (One of the earliest examples of patenting an organism that I can remember, from the 1970s.)

Now! To figure out what offset you want:
Tie a bolt or washer to a piece of string long enough to hang from your fender to your wheel hub. Tape the string (which is acting as a plumb line) on your fender. Using a measuring tool that reads in MM, measure from the string to your wheel's center. Take that number, and adjust your current offset appropriately. 

Roll &amp; pull depend on suspension, as well as wheel specs (width &amp; offset) so this is a better question for after you've bought wheels.

I'd like to see basic income instead of yet another minimum wage increase and some more welfare spending. I want to actually SOLVE problems, not put band aids on them, which seems to be the democratic policy as of late.

Libertarians, on the other hand, want us to become more like third world countries in order to compete with them. Sure, let's lower the minimum wage and get rid of pesky regulations that allow for such things as worker safety, an abolition of child labor, and clean air. Let's  throw out every piece of societal progress we made since the gilded age. 

I don't agree with the ways we do things a lot of the time, but instead of reforming things to increase  efficiency while still maintaining similar positive results, they  want to throw out government altogether. It's a cure worse than the disease."

Hell, I think GRRM did a great job of helping the reader understand and empathize with her motivation behind her treatment of Jon, and people still hold that against her. 

They do that a lot with Cersei, too, which I appreciated. She's another character that's very flawed but you are still supposed to feel sorry for her at times. If the show had made her responsible for killing Robert's bastards, for example, it would've been really difficult for show-viewers to have that slight twinge of sympathy that I think Cersei is supposed to provoke, along with the obvious hate and frustration at her boneheadedness. She's one of the best characters in the series, in my opinion, simply because she evokes all of those emotions in the reader/viewer so successfully. "

homerBM,Advice,1388597122.0,"Was going to refer you to best place to go in this circumstance. I work in sexual health. In that case, tell her not to launder anything she was wearing. When she lands she may want to go to a sexual assault referral centre in whatever country you are in. They will hook up with police if wanted, medical issues and counselling. They can sometimes take forensic samples or set up for you elsewhere. With vaginal samples, you have up to seven days. Oral and rectal are much shorter but that doesn't sound like an issue here. Baseline STI testing is important, which is sometimes done with something called chain of evidence sampling. Even if the crime happened outside your country, if they both live in the same one, a civil or criminal suit may be an option. She may decide against this and has every right to, but it's important any evidence collection be done when the opportunity is there, which can be saved and used later as needed. If she is in crisis, it's not unusual to find making big decisions tough, which is why crisis intervention specific to this issue is important right now. 

For you, just ask her what she needs and do your best to support her. This is a recoverable experience; someone took choices away from her, so she can now choose to not let the awful actions of anyone else defeat her. Let her go through the usual emotions one would expect, and in time she should start feeling fairly normal again. Take advantage of any available professional support to help guide her through the recovery. 

Hope she fares okay"

Obviously approaching with the intention of picking up is a little different, but it's easier if you're at least comfortable initiating with strangers. Also, make friends with women, but do not take dating advice from them."

1. When you flip the camera to take a selfie with front camera, it doesn't then mirror it like with normal cameras so you actually get the picture you took, not a mirrored one (which I find throws off some of my pictures and it really pisses me off).

2. It deletes ALL pictures/videos so you can send ugly things to friends, cheeky snaps of other people, random messages etc.

For instance, I quote ""gyms are numbingly bad for your mind."" That really is not the case and depends on the person. I quote again ""There is some evidence to support the view that working out, and other forms of body-anxiety, may be sicknesses of affluence—driven by unreasonable and unachievable expectations about where the rowing machine can take you."" ""Some"" is a very ambiguous word. This article shall not be taken seriously for it calumniates working out and going to the gym.

Dookiet,books,1388597250.0,"And you seem to be denying change that has happened. I'm not against literary criticism, to insinuate so is silly. I'm against JUDGING historical literature, and authors for not understanding modernity. Acknowledge their bias, acknowledge our  different and more equal understanding of gender roles, but don't judge a man born in the late 19th century and raised in the early twentieth for not writing female characters. Hell he at least had the good sense not to write them. I would rather an author write all male or female characters than write uninteresting one dimensional characters. We continue to make judgements on historical and long dead authors from our perspective with our bias, and as I stated previously it's one of the reasons I like Yan Martel's writing, it forces us as readers to let go of our bias, and preconceived notions of how people should behave. Making judgements about something (not critiquing it) creates issues in how we view it. Put simply judgement is the end of discourse. When we make a judgement we stop seeing things from the other persons perspective, ignoring that books and characters are a reflection of the author and the time in which they where written, and instead feel that all literature should cater to our desires, and point of view."

* ***Aura Cacia* 100% Argan Oil** - Love it! Twice a day, all over me face!
* ***Urban Decay* eyeshadow in ""Maui Wowi""** - Literally my favorite color of theirs! The only one I've ever used up completely!
*  ***Psst!* Clarify and Shine Scalp Treatment** - I know it's not makeup, but I got this in my Freeman spooky bag and liked this stuff a lot.  It really kept my hair feeling lightweight!
* ***Birchbox Beauty Protector* Protect and Detangle** - Again, I know it's not makeup, but I've gone through 3 bottles of this shit now and it's UHMAZING!

**Purchases:**

* ***Urban Decay* Vice2 Palette** - Annnnd I'm broke...and IN LOVE! Shellshock is probably my favorite, all silvery and shit.

* ***Urban Decay* Naked3 Palette** - I love all the colors except for Dust, which only works okay when applied wet on Primer Potion and then set with spray.

* ***Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics* Lip Tar, All-star Mini x12 set** - Because HOLY SHIT LIP TAR! I love this stuff! I really appreciate that they included a lighter neutral tan color so that I can mix and blend some of the darker ones to better complement my skin tone. 

* ***Urban Decay* Eyeshadow Primer Potion in Greed** - I got this because it was $10 at Nordstrom Rack, and /u/dirtygirlcamo is a terrible influence and tells me when these things go on sale, and then drives me to the store so I can buy it in some sort of ritual, best friend sacrifice to the makeup gods.  But honestly, this stuff is pretty legit, though quite shimmery. It doubles as a nice highlighter.

* ***Benefit* Gimme Brow!** - I really like this stuff; it fills in the gaps quite nicely! However, I still use the wax and hard angled brush of *Benefit* Brow Zings to line the underside of my brows and make 'em pop!

That's all I have for now, but I'm actually heading out the door to go to Sephora and pick up some of Urban Decay's Prep/Setting sprays that I tested out over the weekend and LOVED! Soooo yeah, that's happening.

snobord,relationships,1388597448.0,"Sounds like a typical cycle of abuse. Thing start out great, abused falls in love and dependent on the abuser. Then things slowly deteriorate and soon becomes abusive. Once the abused is ready to leave, abuser becomes the sweet person the abused fell in love with while also taking advantage of the abused's dependence on the abuser, prompting the abused to stay. It then starts over as the relationship again deteriorates until there is enough abuse that the abused wants to leave again. Wouldn't you know it, the abuser is again the sweet person the abused loved, prompting them to stay again...until the cycle repeats again. You want out? Become independent and leave for good (not necessarily in that order).

Edit to add: it actually sounds like you're lucky. You've not had too much time for the cycle to repeat too many times and things haven't gotten too physical...yet. Seriously, get out now. Considering they've already become physical, it will only become more so and the longer you stay the more dependent you will become. You think it's hard leaving now?

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388597546.0,"&gt; Then dont complain when we have no jobs and no good growth.

I'll complain all I want and place the blame squarely at the foot of the corporations screwing everyone over for a quick buck. It's THEIR fault. Not ours for not catering to their every whim and INCREASING our wealth inequality from already near record levels to satisfy them.

You're saying that because they hold a gun to the country's head we should negotiate with terrorists.

&gt;FALSE. Service economies DO NOT create wealth. Only manufacturing and farming creates wealth. It's economic death to concentrate on service because all of your wealth goes to other countries that you buy goods from.

Good thing we have one of the largest agrarian economies in the world still....unless global warming from all your manufacturing doesn't kill that too. Aren't we the largest exporters of food in the world?

Also, didn't GDP grow bt 2.2% last year? One of the highest in the industralized world? I take it you've never been or seen one of those guys who was laid off from their companies before right after the term ""record profits"" came up. It's not that the rich don't have the money to give us. It's that they won't. All you need to know about our economy is [this graph](http://www.motherjones.com/files/corporate-profits.jpg).

I'm sorry, but your capitalism does not adequately provide the needs of the PEOPLE. I know this is a foreign concept to you, seeing how you think economic growth, even if it's only concentrated at the top, is this great thing, but it's not. What you propose is a reduction to third world standards so some such ***hole makes out like a bandit. Either way, the average worker doesn't benefit all that much.

&gt;Service economies just inefficiently move the wealth around. That, coupled with taxation, means wealth shrinks.

Taxation doesn't suck the money into a black hole, contrary to libertarian belief. It simply moves the money around too...it pays workers, it creates goods the private sector doesn't, it sometimes redistributes wealth."

It WORKS. Look at how we do on healthcare compared to the rest of the world. Here;'s where your ideological bias shows through. You don't care about doing what works like you seem to be, you're just for pushing your extreme right wing ideology.

&gt;Basic income is just another name for welfare.

It's more efficient though. Current welfare system gets bad results because there are so many freaking requirements added to it and the like. And then there's the welfare trap, etc.

&gt;Show me where the problems were solved?

As far as basic income goes, just check r/basicincome out, there are stories of success with it every day popping up any more in pilot studies and the like.

There's mincome in canada in the 70's. India had good results with it. As  did namibia. I think there was recently an article about sudan too. Brazil, etc. Many of these studies seem a dramatic reduction in poverty, and believe it or not, in some cases, they actually saw an increase in productivity and working hours in some cases.

As far as universal healthcare...just look at every other industrialized world.

&gt;     America doesn't currently have a third world culture or work ethic.

What does this have to do with anything?!

&gt;Min wage is racist and elitist... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jv1Zae0sgo

CheekyLittleCunt,yugioh,1388598362.0,"You have plenty of attack negation, the problem with Fiendish chain is, it's very fragile; an mst or a lance will get past fiendish chain, it clogs up your zones after as well. 

Veilers only answer is a book of moon or some form of veiler negation like debunk or divine wrath. You don't need to set veiler, you can play it going second (especially against the mirror match). And on spellbooks, it's ability to be revived by book of life for synchro plays needs to be noted as well. 

As a gameplay choice, a lot of players this past format haven't got used to veiler. They see an empty backrow or a lone set fate and they think they're in the clear; veiler normally is that trap that your opponent can't read. It's psychologically better. Many people will be reckless when they see few backrow. 


Now thinking of post LVAL, cards like Exciton Knight and the re-emergence of Lightsworn will mean veiler will be stronger again. Lyla can pop your fiendish chains, and when playing spellbook, you want to save your Fates for the most important threat.  yes fiendish chain lasts longer, but that doesn't matter to you; you're just going to be running over their monster next turn with power anyway. 

Veiler does the same job but is what I'd say 80-90% likely to resolve (only main decked answer to it I can think if is book if moon), while chain has maybe 60% chance to resolve. (With my own made up anecdotal statistics)"

At one side of the house (I'm still in college mind you) there's a really awesome guy who just came back form work trying to put himself through school and he just wants to have a good time. So you talk about what your plans are after school and why you want to do what you do. Whilst playing a game of pong together.  Then in the doorway there's a girl who just ran into her old high school friend who just happens to know someone that goes to the school. They start catching up and then end up staying up all night together talking for hours just to catch up.  Then there's a group of the hottest girls who you have ever seen, at this house at least. But you know that parties aren't where you find ""the one"" so you move on and talk to that really cute girl from your 1st semester political science class tomorrow.  Then the DJ (please don't knock my profession) is playing your favorite song and you just HAVE to scream it out loud because why wouldn't you? You know no one cares so you do it and you happen to find someone who is singing it as well.  Then you run into your best friend, literally the two of you are inseparable. You have a few drinks together get sloshed and make the long trek back to your house, because every time you drink you remember the kid form high school that died after drinking and driving, all while just sharing in each others company.

&gt;^(If I had my way, Facebook would have a hard and fast expiration date for posts. But most of our Timelines are full of this rotting nonsense. The new year inspires people to make a clean start, and with that motivation, I set out to delete everything I had posted on Facebook that was more than a month old. Finding my past is easy. Before deleting everything, you might want to save a copy of it. I averaged about 10 “activities” per day. Deleting 30,000 things takes a long time. Some events can’t be deleted. On average, it took 20 to 30 minutes to purge a month’s worth of posts. I found two options: the Facebook Timeline Cleaner and Absterge, both scripts than can run in the Firefox or Chrome browsers. Facebook Timeline Cleaner is the more nuanced option. Absterge is less subtle: It deletes everything. I ran Absterge over a few sections, and then over my whole timeline. The most frustrating thing: I found that posts I deleted would reappear later. When moving through the Activity Log, although I was occasionally amused when I came across a picture or an old meme I’d posted (remember “25 random things about me”?)^), ^(I never found anything that I felt was important enough to keep. I ran Absterge over a few sections, and then over my whole timeline. The real lesson I learned from this exercise is how difficult it is to manage one’s online persona. And that’s just Facebook.

High fat food, and high fat ingredients, are ALWAYS more desirable to is. We have taste preferences developed from evolutionary need for fat stores. We developed from species that were highly skilled predators, and very resourceful gatherers. We have never been large or powerful animals. This means we need fat (slow burning fuel with a high Calorie concentration) to sustain us in between meals. There is still a primal aspect in your palette that tells you to load up on fat and sugar (I'm simplifying, but this ELI5) for fuel storage. Ask the sciences for the role the ATP cycle plays to further expand on this. The body converts most everything, after extracting necessary nutrients, to fat. Obviously, taking in fats means less work for us on a cellular level. "

Skinkerus,weightroom,1388598789.0,"Typically, soreness is an indicator that you have done something that your body is not used to and not that you aren't working hard enough.  For instance, after squatting low-bar for the first six months of training I switched to high-bar.  Even though the weight was lighter my quads were very sore the next day (I experienced new soreness after switching to front squatting as well).

While most recommendations say to aim for one hour training sessions there is plenty of disagreement on this point.  Many old-time strongmen trained for hours on end...

&gt; Anderson developed a training protocol so unique it makes
echidnas and duck-billed platypuses seem positively pedestrian in comparison— the
golf workout. To facilitate day-long training, Anderson set up two golf holes on his farm
about 300 yards apart with a weight rack at either end. He'd whack the ball down to
the one hole, which was next to an outdoor rack with a bar loaded to 400 lbs. He'd do
3-5 reps in the overhead press with it, then whack the ball back to the other hole, where
he'd set up a squat rack loaded to 800. He'd bang out 3-5 reps on the squat with that
weight, then repeat, all afternoon. The total volume he must have lifted had to have
been astonishing, and was likely a pretty decent way to spend an afternoon.

From *Destroy the Opposition*, Jamie Lewis

I tend to take the side of ""do what works for you"", which may or may not come off as bullshit.  Experimenting for myself almost always gives the most valuable answers.  Currently I aim for 75-90 minutes plus ~10 minutes of foam rolling and light stretching and that works well for me."

But at the same time make one joke about women and BOOM!  She'd go off on how sexist you are.  She even made us watch a short documentary on why sexist jokes towards women were bad.  Loved the woman, but it was hysterical how hypocritical she was.  Oh I also found out that she gave me extra credit on my papers where I made Judaism a theme (she was Jewish).

Dogs generally have great leg strength so a back-clipping harness actually allows them to continue to leverage their strength and stare (and as a result get more riled up). Where as with a front-clipping dog harness-leash combination you remove some of the leverage and can better utilize the combo to change directions and break that stare."

lamblikeawolf,short,1388599480.0,"Being shy is not the same as being an introvert.

Shyness has to do with some level of social anxiety.

Being introverted has to do with where your emotional energy comes from. Specifically, extroverts are ""charged up"" or gain energy from being around other people. They feel energized around other people, and often adding more and more people adds to it. Introverts, on the other hand, are ""drained"" or lose energy from being around other people. They require alone time to ""recharge"" and often, the more people around them trying to interact, the faster their energy is drained and they want to run screaming down the street. (This is why introverts avoid parties.)

People can have social anxiety issues and still be extroverts. People can be introverts without social anxiety issues."

Never had a conversation about it since, and no one had any issues or anything. We did set up our life insurance policies a little different - mine goes to my brother as custodian, and his goes to his brother as trustee, specifically to provide for the kids after our final bills are paid.

The blades in cold dew

Stab upward faithfully to the sky, like trees in miniature

To frame the wide world above me.


Lying in dampness

Blades rustle beneath,

I exhale, and, chest rising,

let the Peace of the world 

Come and fill my dark void.


For the earth, and sky, and beyond

As I breathe the cold air round about

All enfold me in the Night.

Stop confusing communism with moderate social policy. There are many shades of left, just as there are many shades of right, stop lumping all ideas in one category.

&gt;Socialism always fails because eventually you run out of other peoples money. You cant steal that way forever.

Ok, now, you're going off the deep end and being a whackjob, especially if you're gonna repeat that lame talking point, which forgets about money being pumped back into the economy.

If it works in every other case, in a variety of conditions, I say we try it here. Normally when people say this they think the US is exceptionally lazy without offering any proof.

&gt;Comparatively high black unemployment and teen unemployment proves that wrong.

People who are generally less educated and less skilled (not trying to be racist here, but it's true, and it's an after effect of actual racism) means that minorities make less money? Who knew? You're conflating causal relationships here, and cherrypicking the problems. Typical libertarian.

&gt;What are the CURRENT black crime, welfare and poverty statistics compared to whites?

Once again, you're conflating causal relationships here without looking at the broader issue, which is the legacy of discrimination. Just because the policies aren't racist any more doesn't mean African Americans and the like aren't suffering due to a legacy of racism that basically has economically crippled them. 

&gt;Yes, the sky will fall if we roll back stuff. You are Chicken Little.

You're literally proposing we become like third world countries in order to compete with them. You do realize how crazy that sounds, right?"

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1388599749.0,"I'm reading the original thread a little late, so I don't know what the top comments originally were, but I'm not seeing anything overly harsh towards the OP.

One thing really stuck out to me though, and it's not being heavily discussed, but to me it explains the wife's motive: After they were told by a doctor that she was infertile, they ceased their use of all the contraception they'd been using before. He said that she was on the pill *and* they'd been using condoms *and* he was considering getting a vasectomy, and had only held off getting one at her request before she was told she was infertile. So all that stopped. And it sounds like she genuinely believed she was infertile. He says that he expressed relief over it. 

And then she got pregnant. I've never been in her situation, but how many men would feel deceived if after all that, knowing that she deep down wants kids, after ceasing their birth control methods, she got pregnant. How could he not at least suspect she did it on purpose? Isn't this something that TRP is actively afraid of? And she knew all that. So instead of casting that doubt into his mind, she just decided to quietly have an abortion. I'm not saying it's what she should have done, but it explains her behavior. 

As others in this thread over here have said, people also seem to be reacting to the OP's multiple instances of expressing anger over it and wanting to expose his wife to that anger. One of the highest voted comments simply urges the OP to take things slow and not say anything rash that he might later regret. It sounds like she was afraid of telling him about the pregnancies, and then here he is confirming that he's angry about it. I'm very curious to see if he posts an update to the situation, because there's a lot we don't know. I see he also hasn't answered the top rated comment, asking how he would have reacted had his wife told him she was pregnant. I'm very curious to hear his response.

**edit**: Also, who wants to bet that if she *had* told him about the pregnancy, there would be a different post by the OP on /r/relationships to the tune of ""My wife told me she was infertile so we stopped using birth control and now she's pregnant? What should I do?"" How kind do you think those comments would be towards the OP's wife? I'd bet money it would end up on TRP."

Kaisharga,sex,1388599775.0,"Fuck, I am dealing with this right the hell now. It's very frustrating! I'll do all kinds of things to make her come in all manner of interesting ways, but I never get to climax anywhere except inside her. 

I (32m) like coming inside her (37f)! I enjoy fucking her. But it feels off balance. I am super jealous that she gets to come in other ways. Wait, that's not right. I am super jealous that she has a partner who wants to make her come in other ways. That's really what it is. And it makes me feel like a complete shit.

Complicating the issue is that, while I feel like I'm the one who's been biologically given the short end of the stick, since one climax and I'm out, but really it's *her* who has the shitty deal, because she can *only* have the real, actually-fulfilling Big O if she feels me come inside her. No pressure, right? So if I want her to have the full experience, I *have to* come inside her. There's no other way she can be truly satisfied in the same way that is so absurdly easy for me. And that means if I want to come in any other way or by any other means, I have to deprive her of the very same. Deliberately. Fuck.

It's a frustrating situation, and it feels terrible to feel this way about it. The only way I can see to uproot the issue is to find another way to get her to the Big O. Wish me luck, and let me know if you two work something out that I might be able to learn from!"

* [Are a lot of indie games just glorified online flash games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fp8ra/are_a_lot_of_indie_games_just_glorified_online/)  
It was interesting to read the various arguments supporting a divide between online flash and full indie games, although the comments section felt a *lot* like ChangeMyView, since few seemed to support OP's opinion. I liked the top commenter's idea that, instead of focusing on indie games being overmarketed Flash games, we should focus on why online flash (e.g. the Frantic series, Diamond Hollow II, Epic Battle Fantasy series) is looked down upon compared to downloaded games with a similar feel (e.g. Rogue Legacy, Audiosurf, Binding of Isaac).

Furthermore, I think that it can actually discourage people from trying to go against the gender mold when all the examples of this that they see are full of the message ""THAT CHARACTER IS SO BRAVE TO DEFY GENDER ROLES, THIS IS NOT NORMAL AND PEOPLE WILL BE ANGRY AND/OR LAUGH AT YOU IF YOU DO IT, AS THEY DO TO HIM OR HER.""

seanomenon,alcoholism,1388600204.0,"Hi. This is a big step. Some people take years to get there, some have to be dragged kicking and screaming, and some never get there at all. Kudos to you for having the self-awareness and honesty to admit your alcoholism to yourself.

That said, its only the beginning. It's the easy part. The hard part is making a lasting change. Quitting drinking is easy - I've done it a hundred times. Staying quit is hard. To make it stick, I needed the support of other sober alcoholics. They were able to help me figure out what this thing is, and how to live with it. They gave me a shoulder to cry on, a hard dose of reality, and hundreds of examples of healthy, happy sober lives. I highly recommend trying a few local AA meetings. (Try a few, because different meetings have different personalities.)

As a fellow atheist, (godless high five!) I can tell you that the religious aspect of most AA meetings is minimal to tolerable. Yes, there are some holy rollers in recovery, and they are often loudmouths about it. But that's true in many aspects of life. But honestly, even the most religious meeting I've ever been to was primarily focused on sobriety.

Here are a few atheist recovery ""hacks"", things that have helped me get the most out of the fellowship of sober drunks called AA.

+ Meetings in non-religious locations (not church basements) tend to be less religious. Try meetings at the YMCA, Hospital, or community center.

+ Gay-friendly meetings tend to be less religious.

+ There are [agnostic AA meetings](http://agnosticaanyc.org/worldwide.html) out there. (I love them.)

+ An [agnostic version of the 12 steps](http://www.aaagnostics.org/agnostic12steps.html) helps me see past the religon and find the wisdom in the steps. 

+ remember that at its heart, AA is a support group. That is its biggest value to me - the opportunity to talk about this thing with other people who understand.

You're making a wise choice for yourself - please don't talk yourself out of it. Good luck."

Listen, first off you need to drop everything and remember that you're the most important person in your life. You're not perfect, none of us are. There are things you can change and there and things that you can't. Forget about the things you can't change. Your height, your face, genetics, etc. Flat out stop worrying about them.

The things you can change, such as your confidence, you should worry about. [http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-become-an-ultra-high-value-alpha-male-and-attract-women-2011-5](Read this.)

A good step into becoming more confident is caring less and more about certain things. /r/howtonotgiveafuck will teach you that the thoughts and opinions of those who don't matter to you are useless. Read the first KINTA post on the sidebar about confidence. You need to be bold while you're with her, and you must think that you're the man without letting others know why. 

You need to start being more of a leader around her, and being more sexual. Dress better. Truly start believing in yourself and that you're capable of doing things.

YNAB makes you plan at the beginning of the months, how you will spend your money.Of course you can adjust it but you will have a general plan on how much you'll spend on partying for example.

When I think about buying something, I do not check my balance. Let's say I want to buy a new MP3 Album. I check the ""Media"" category I created and see what I have left to spend here. I usually set it to 40€ every month and if enough is left I buy it as I know it won't take money away where it's really needed.  

It can also help you cut spending. After looking and the reports a few months after I started using it I could see that I spent way too much a percentage on electronic cigarettes, so I decided I had to cut spending here.

I had tried quite some budgeting programs over the years but YNAB was the first one that was so simple and usable that I actually used it and kept on using it. Over a year now.

If you are in the US I think you can even import your transactions semi automatically, but that doesn't work with the German banks I checked. It's not too much of a bother to enter transactions every few days though."

You guys were absolutely right, adding additional mana-fixing capacities to land is a green ability.  So instead I present a humble cycle of cards that turn lands into the appropriate type of basics, with a green exception.  Each of these cards has a characteristic to make it much more useful to play on your own lands than on your opponent's, since the role for these cards is to help you get your mana in order, not to sabotage your opponent's mana base.  Still, they can do that, but to a more limited degree than cards like Spreading Seas and Evil Presence.

The white one is free to get rid of at the beginning of the enchanted land's controller's upkeep, so it does have some use against opponents in drawing out or preventing instants and flash effects they might use before that.

Blue is on-color for mana-sabotage with Spreading Seas, so its effect allows the enchanted land's controller to return it to their hand at the beginning of your, not their, upkeep.  This allows them to make another land drop after they cast it if they don't need the colored mana, then bounce the enchanted land after they've used it to cast whatever big spell on their turn.  On the other hand it does serve as color denial for a turn.  Note that it's the enchanted land's controller that draws a card, not necessarily the aura's controller.

Pit of Despair also provides a card to the enchanted land's controller, and it's easy enough to get rid of at the beginning of that player's upkeep for a standard expenditure of life.

Precipice of Might just asks for a red mana to get rid of it, and again, it provides the cantrip effect to the player who controls the enchanted land.

Clearing of Tranquility has no offensive use, as it makes the land a Forest in addition to its other types, so it doesn't have a way to easily get rid of it."

Sabu113,soccer,1388600661.0,"Welbeck/Rooney is a much more physically combative side that can drop deeper and fight for the ball if necessary. Also both are better at holding up a lumped up ball for others to come into the play. Kagawa is much more dependent on the wingers and 9 coming around him to exchange passes. Right now we rarely seem to have the technical ability to play with Kagawa though a Nani/Januzaj side probably could work beautifully if they were given a run of a few games for the majority of the 90.* Moyes prefers overloads on the wing to quick passing and highly technical football. 

Also imo he's shit on the wing. 

*He's not going to run around the pitch tackling people like Rooney. He's  a positionally limited player dependent on using his WC passing skill to make up for limited pace. This being pushed off the ball nonsense is a bit ignorant. He's great at using the ball to make up for his size. The thing is that he needs an option to offload it."

People claim zinc can reduce oiliness, which is another reason I decided to take it.  

If I take zinc tablets on an empty stomach I will have bad stomach aches. Also, I have noticed I get headaches when taking zinc regardless. Most of the times they are minor. My sex drive has sharply increased. I was looking through some forums and men were talking about how zinc made them horny.

Wtfisthisgamebtw,Planetside,1388600981.0,"main idea is to have a better counterplay to current lock ons, the current flares are near useless, having a fuel based flare, think of it as Light assault's jetpack recharge system.

current flare works like this : you get a lock on, and you have a window of time to use it, and it gives a 2nd window of immunity, then you wait for the cooldown.

my suggestion would be, lets say flares have 100 fuel, for A2A it would take 50 units of flare to repel it away, now if you overuse it by mistake, you cant flare the 2nd lockon, and if you dont use enough the flare didnt help at all (bringing skill to the matter of using it)

and for G2A it would consume lets say 70, so you have to wait a bit for the recharge, so esfs arent completely immune to G2A Lockons. 

again, numbers can be changed, my main suggestion is a new mechanic to flares to make them, 1st more fun to use and more engaging, 2nd be a better counterplay to lockons"

mrpoopistan,TheRedPill,1388600991.0,"""I have a problem being attracted to most women""

No one else here is going to have the courage to call bullshit, so I'll step to the plate.

If you're truly having trouble being attracted to at least a decent percentage of the opposite sex, the most probable explanation is either repressed homosexuality or early childhood emotional trauma tied to a doting mother.

The fact that excessive alcohol consumption is part of your behavior suggests that you need to consider digging deeper than ""hey, I need advice"".

Someone down thread suggested checking out Fetlife. If you're not going to look into counseling or therapy (which I'd feel safe guessing that almost no one in the TRP threads is inclined to do), frankly channeling your behavior in a more satisfying manner is the next best choice."

circledot,Teachers,1388601048.0,"Reading these is making me really thankful for my low/mid SES district. I went to a private school and I remember this attitude among my peers and their families (not all but a lot). People threw trash on the ground because ""it's the janitor's job to pick it up"". Bullies were rampant and the school did nothing because they played sports (big $ maker for the school) and/or their families gave the school money. 

I did after school programs at a middle school in a high SES district before I started my teaching program. Those kids were way tougher to deal with than my students now for a lot of reasons. Some were great, but others were nightmares whose parents were convinced they had ADHD and would medicate them instead of teaching them self-control. I almost lost my job for telling a kid who *locked me in a closet* that he was ""acting like a jerk"". The kid's mom said that the kind of language I used was ""harmful to her child's development"".

Also, the school itself had no respect for me or my program. They constantly complained that I left the room I used in disarray, and finally moved me from a classroom into the cafeteria. I would stay after for at least 30 minutes cleaning, but if I missed anything they would lose it, and would say that I was stealing things from the teachers. I ordered pizza for the kids and put the leftovers in the fridge with a note for the next day. I came back and the teachers had eaten it all during in-service. I felt like the school had this attitude that I was beneath them.

Ugh, just typing this is annoying me. I'm going to just say a prayer of thanks every time I have a bad day at school. I can deal with those issues and feel like I am doing something good. I can't fix entitlement, though."

This means that there is a very good chance that your next relationship would be better than this one.  You will have a much better idea of the things you want and now many things you don't want.

That said, you might want to use this chance to maximize your learning experience.  Sit down, tell him you are really unhappy at times and want to discuss ways to communicate better and work together to find solutions.

Don't make it accusatory, just tell him how you are feeling.  Take turns talking where you don't interrupt, just listen.  In addition, a good trick is to repeat what the other person just said in your own words and have them agree that is what they mean.

This will show that you are listening and both understand what the problems actually are.  Then discuss strategies and solutions together.  When one of you has a problem or is unhappy, it is bad for both of you.  Thus, these problems should always be seen as the both of you versus the problem, not you versus him."

shankrabbit,glutenfree,1388601450.0,"I wouldn't go gluten free if I were you. Gluten free diets are a huge fad right now and everyone is attributing going gluten free with feeling better. Most of the time its because any time you analyze and watch your diet, you're eating healthier. However, there are a lot of benefits in the grains that you'd be missing out on if you needlessly went GF. 

From someone who medically can't eat it and wishes he could, trust me... eating healthy far outweighs eating only GF.

But, your choice is your choice... so if you still do it here's where you start:

1. Make everything yourself. Say goodbye to eating out unless you know if a certified GF place that only does GF food.

2. Read every label twice. Things like ""modified food starch"" and ""natural flavors"" are bucket words and may contain gluten.

3. Potato, rice, soy, and tapioca are all fine replacements for wheat flour, but it takes a magical mixture of them to create a flour that kind of but sort of doesn't quite work. 

4. Prepare for withdrawal. If you're committed to the diet then you're going to struggle because there will always be the voice in the back of your head saying ""you can cheat this once"". If you do cheat, you'll get some gurblies in your tummy. This isn't because of gluten, it's because you probably just ate something like a pizza. 

Good luck!"

One important thing to prevent yourself from being cheated on is establishing clear boundaries early and sticking to them.  If messaging other girls is outside your acceptable boundaries and he does it, then things should end right there.  When you accept things instead, you are just giving a green light to do whatever. 

Also, being firm on this means you can move on sooner to a new guy that actually respects your boundaries rather than wasting a year with one who makes you insecure.  That said, being overly insecure will drive guys away, so do try to work on your issues with it."

This other guy who I mentioned in my post said he was OK with it, but wanted/needed some contact of some sort. Haven't seen him in a few weeks though because of winter break at school.

There was a guy in one of my classes this semester who I was friends with and when we were hanging out one time with other friends, sex was brought up and I openly stated my decision. He 100% felt differently, but later in the semester he shared that he wanted to start something with me. So he knew my position going in but still liked me (I did not return the feelings and didn't further anything).

If you really want to go off the beaten track, it's quite simple.  Wake up in the morning, go to a bus or train station, and get on a bus or train going somewhere you've never heard of.  You can leave your stuff at a hostel if you plan on returning that night (it might be worth packing a day pack in case you can't make it back that day) or take your stuff with you and just figure it out.  However, don't expect to find hostels in places that are off the beaten track; make sure to learn how to say and read ""room for rent"" in the local language as if you want to stay overnight you'll probably have to rent a private room. 

Another thing that might help is hosting some Couchsurfers before you go.  By welcoming surfers into your own home you'll do two really important things.  First, you'll learn locals-only knowledge about far-off places and make local connections.  Second, you'll get some good references from surfers, proving you're not just on CS to mooch free accommodation and local knowledge, so that when you travel you'll have better luck finding locals to stay with (or to meet for coffee).  I've hosted a few surfers but have yet to stay with anyone overseas, however it is my personal connections with people around the world (that I've made in other ways, through work, school, etc.) that have led to some of the most interesting, off-the-beaten-path experiences.  If you don't already have that network, CS is an easy way to build one."

fffangold,dogecoin,1388602090.0,"For me, it was partially about the community, partially about the accessibility in why I started mining Dogecoin.

For the community, it just seems like everyone in this subreddit is having a lot of fun, not taking things too seriously, yet also is there to help out newbies to the game. Pretty much, it's a nice place to visit.

For the accessibility, this subreddit has a great guide to getting started, though this is true of many cryptocurrencies I imagine.

He is also ridiculously obsessed with the opinions of our extended family (who he deliberately moved us over 3,000km away from) and what our community thinks about ""his"" family despite being deeply antisocial, having next to no contact with these people and doing weird things that have probably put them off of us way more than anything my sister and I do in our private lives ever could (like keeping a loud, barking rottweiler locked up in a cage in the garage so it scares the shit out of anyone who approaches the house.) He is very weirdly image-obsessed and also uses that as a control tactic.

At least he wasn't sexually inappropriate. My mom almost succeeded in giving me some issues there with her horrible attitudes towards sex but I always knew she was full of shit anyways.

The all-powerful being looked around, startled. The voice had seemingly come from nowhere.

""Um...excuse me?""

A person was now standing next to the god, looking very annoyed. ""You heard me. That double helix looks like a five year old slapped it together. Do you even know what you're doing?""

The god blinked. Who was this guy? ""I'm not sure who you think you are, but you're kind of being a dick.""

""Oh, *excuse me,* your highness, I didn't know you had no respect for your elders.""

Now the god was getting angry. Some guy walks in here and tells him he's wrong, with no explanation, and thinks he deserves *respect?* The god clapped his hands, and the rude man disappeared.

The god smiled, then returned to his work. He couldn't decide on quadrupeds or bipeds for the most advanced species of this planet. Oh, yes, he had big, big plans. Worlds upon worlds, one day interacting across the vast swathes of interstellar nothingness. Their constructions will--

""Yeah, no, you're going to want to go with bipeds. Quadrupeds tend to take up more space."" That asshole was back, this time with a very large cup emblazoned with some kind of logo. They were slurping from a straw, and the liquid was brown.

The god sighed, then clapped his hands. The man disappeared, then reappeared almost immediately.

""Hey, stop that. It takes, like, half a second to get back here. I'm just trying to help, you asshat.""

The god was very angry. ""I'M NOT THE ASSHAT HERE, YOU ARE! WHO IN THE HELL ARE YOU, ANYWAY?! GET OUT OF HERE AND LET ME MAKE THIS UNIVERSE IN PEACE!!"" He took a swing at the other person, but his punch went right through the man's body.

They sipped their drink leisurely, then said, ""Look, I *thought* you'd want help here, since you're the new guy and all, but if that's the way you're going to--""

""SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!! I don't need any help from a shitty person like you! Just go away. GO. AWAY. Let me make mistakes, go back to your own fucked-up universe!""

The man gasped, exaggeratedly holding a hand up to their mouth. ""Why, I never! Well, if that's the way you're going to be, I'll just leave."" And with that, they disappeared.

The god sighed. ""Finally. Now I can get back to work."" He began crafting the genetic code of this creature. Double helixes were so overdone, and incredibly inefficient. He was going to be creative, and make this a quadruped that could stand on its hind legs when sufficiently evolved, if need be.

""Haha, just kidding, my universe is super boring. I'm going to crash here for a while."" The man was back, this time in a big moving van full of junk.

ratajewie,todayilearned,1388602310.0,"You sit on your foam square in pre-school, playing with a bouncy ball. You decide to roll your ball at a really slow speed across your foam square. Well, when you roll the ball, someone starts pulling on your square and making it bigger. The ball, however, is still rolling the same slow speed. It never goes any faster. Normally, it would take 10 seconds to cross your square. Now that the person has stretched it and made the square bigger, it takes it 20 seconds to cross it. The ball still rolled at the same time, but it takes twice as long to reach the end of the square because the square is now twice as big, and the ball never sped up. (Edit: if the person rolled the ball NOW, it would take 20 seconds. When they rolled it, it took 10. Since the floor is twice as big now, it takes 20.)
The universe is like the square. The light left that galaxy 13 billion years ago. The universe has expanded and stretched and gotten bigger, but the light has never gotten any faster, like the ball. Normally, it would take 13 billion years to get to us. Since the universe got bigger while the light was moving, it took longer to get to us.
EDIT: someone brought to my attention that I messed up a little. It sounded different in my head.
ACTUALLY, the light did take 13 billion years to get to us. If the light was sent right now, it would take 30 billion years because the galaxy is twice as far away.
EDIT 2: I figured it out even better. The galaxy was CLOSER than 13 billion light years away at first. Say, 5 billion. The expansion of the universe as the might was moving made its relative speed slower than normal, even though it still went the same actual speed (like when if you run 10 mph on a bus going 50 mph forward, your relative velocity is 40 mph forward). Since the relative speed was slower, it took 13 billion years to get to us. Since it took that long for the light to hit us, the galaxy, which moved with the universe, was even further away. The galaxy is now 30 billion light years away. BUT, since the universe is ever-expanding, it would probably take longer than 30 billion years for the light to reach us that leaves the galaxy now."

hawaiian0n,relationship_advice,1388602334.0,"I also have an asian overly attached parent due to a family break. (Messy divorce) so I have dealt with this EXACT situation a few times.

First, what is your girlfriends major? If its a major like English or Humanities or Nutrition or Art, it could be that your ASIAN mother doesn't put much stock into your girlfriends financial and life planning abilities and is just scraping at other aspects if her to build a case to leave her.

My parent did this when I was dating a ""photography' major. We got engaged and my parent didn't talk to me for 2 years. Turned out the financial disparity led to us cancelling the marriage and my parent was right, but it was a process I needed to go through to grow as a person. It wasn't their right to dig into my life. 

Secondly, does your single parent have a social life? My parent's coping method for their failed marriage was to dedicate 100% of their time to raising the ""perfect"" child. They had no friends, no social circle. Their friday night was assigning me extra practice homework and checking it after.

If your mother is like that as well, she is losing her only social stability if you move on and date people. She only knows her life raising you and can suffer depression and empty nest syndrome because a child who took up 90% of her life is now gone.


Just some things to think about.

Here is what I'm doing now with my overly attached parent and new girlfriend (of 1+ years).

I told my parent to ""adopt"" her as their own and to push both of us to accel in life. I made it clear that if my parent gave me any ultimatums I would return the favor. I reassured that I know some relations dont work, but that this is a process I must go through and that if my parent loves me they will support me and help me experience this courtship age.

Hope that helps. PM me if you need more help dealing with ASIAN parents. I've gotten better over the years."

I'd grown out of it in high school where the horse girl had never ridden a horse but liked to pretend she had a farm full of them. She was weird. She also told us she was injecting drugs (age 12) and that she was going to fly us to America for her 13th birthday so we could go shopping New York courtesy of her birth parents who had just re-entered her life.

Omega037,relationships,1388602476.0,"Well, you can either decide to stay a loser or decide to start getting things together in your life.

First, calm down.  You are only 25, and most 25 year olds are still trying to figure out relationships, careers, finances, and life in general.

Second, you need to get a job.  Is there something that is preventing you from getting one?  How hard are you looking and how often do you fill out applications?  Have you gone to college?

Third, you should exercise for your health but stop worrying about your body.  Being happy with yourself is more important to attracting people than putting on a little muscle.

Fourth, why do you want to learn Japanese?  Depending on the reasoning, I would have different advice for you.

Just_Observational,skyrim,1388602864.0,"You have a disc or do you download? (I'm PC so I really don't know how XBOX works)

If it's only skyrim and you're using a disc something may have happened to it, happened with games occasionally when I had a PS2. Red Faction 2 comes to mind where the big guy would get stuck in the doorway on a timed mission and it started going downhill with more and more problems. The disc got slightly warped from getting too warm.

If it's downloaded then you'd probably need to clean install (you said you already have) and google some of the specific problems and knock out the possibilities one by one until you find what is your problem. If none of the fixes help and you've tested most of them you should then ask customer support.

Also things have broken for me a bit on the PC version when I have the latest patches installed, the patch previous to this one had less bugs for me. (this is when I'm not using mods to bugfix and enhance the game!)

Best of luck, and report back if you fixed it or nothing helped!

Edit: Make sure you search for your general problems for skyrim first then XBOX specific if you find nothing to cover more possibilities! Ignore the PC Master race gamers here, we're all gamers at heart. ;) May you walk on warm sands, traveler."

zallen1868,AskMen,1388602962.0,"Something similar has already been said, but I have a somewhat different approach.

Do use an electric razor to trim as closely as you can before you use a razor blade. Use a new blade every time and throw it away after you use it. Use one with a moisture strip and use sensitive skin shaving cream.

When you are done, immediately take a shower and use something on the region that will remove oil (like soap or face wash). When out of the shower, dry off (rub the towel down ONLY FOR GOD'S SAKE), and then apply some alcohol-free aftershave lotion (good brand [here](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Triple-Protect-Lotion-Ounce/dp/B003NSPOF2/ref=sr_1_3?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388602851&amp;sr=1-3)).

Even with all of these precautions, I still get ingrown hairs and razor burn. You will look good for 2 or 3 days, and then it will look like you have the herp if you are not careful. To minimize this, keep applying some kind of razor burn liquid or more lotion every day or so.

The best time to re-shave is when the hairs are as long as they were when you finished with the electric razor. Usually this is about when the razor burn and ingrown hairs go away too."

karlmoebius,funny,1388603208.0,"Actually, that's pretty much what happened. The invasion of Russia was due to, in large part, to Hitler convincing himself that he could do it. And the more it turned into a meat grinder, the more he blamed his generals, and started taking a direct hand in things. Notable and famous point; D-day, there were panzer divisions under the command of Rommel ready to sweep forward at the slightest attempt of invasion. Rommel of course wanted to ram hard into the first faltering steps of a primarily infantry based and somewhat shakily defended landing area.

But half of them were also commanded by (I forgot the name) but he and Rommel did not like each other, and Hitler ordered that he had final tactical command. When D-day got in the swing of things, the panzer divisions were held up waiting for Hitler to order them to advance. By the time they started rolling (because divisions do not just roll out on a moment's notice), the allies had enough time to fortify defensive positions, and it stalled the offensive. And with an invasion, every minute counts for both sides.

So yeah, the longer the war dragged on, the more Hitler wrested control away overriding his commanders advice and their ability to make war, and played soldier from Berlin. He stopped the development of new technologies, and then when he started again, he favored idiotic fantasy super weapons over incremental advancements to counter the new threats. The famous sturmgewehr was developed and issued in secret. Only after the adoration for the thing reached the eyes of Hitler did he finally authorize it. 

Also remember Germany started the war before they were ready to make war.

I'm missing stuff, and I've probably mis-remembering some things, but I'm on the post new years hangover so, yeah.

griffer00,neuro,1388603314.0,"When neuroscientists use the term ""wiring,"" it can refer to any number of connection-tuning methods. In some cases, it is useful to interpret this literally... for instance, neurons that are connected via gap junctions. However, it is more common for neurons to affect each other ""wirelessly"" through the use of signaling molecules or through ionic fluctuations within a shared, local environment. Generally, the term is best thought of as a way to help laypersons conceptualize neuronal communication, although some factions in neuroscience interpret the view literally (e.g. cable theory).

From a sweeping and generalized view, connection tuning starts with temporary and dynamic mechanisms (e.g. ion balances), moving to short-term changes in biology/physiology (e.g. G-protein signaling), and finally on to long-term structural changes (e.g. bouton development, arborization, gap junction formation). The latter processes tend to consume more resources than the former, and are ""difficult"" to reverse once established, so the brain ""prefers"" the former when possible. 

All these mechanisms increase the probability that an action potential in one neuron will elicit or inhibit an action potential in a connecting neuron -- depending on the released neurotransmitter (excitatory, inhibitory, modulatory). The temporary and dynamic processes are good for flexible neuronal communication, while the long-term processes establish reliable connections at the cost of flexibility. The geometry of neurons also factors into all of this: for instance, a single, well-placed inhibitory connection (i.e. at the soma or a proximal dendrite) can completely override dozens or hundreds of excitatory connections at distal dendrites."

tendorphin,gaming,1388603388.0,"I love the controls for the resident evil games, and they will always be one of my favorite game series. It did make it what it was, and I personally never had a problem with them. It didn't make sense from a narrative perspective, because you couldn't see enemies sometimes when you were shooting at them. Well, ANY 3rd person view doesn't make sense from a narrative perspective, because you can see things around you that any real person wouldn't be able to. 

However, RE4 still had a lot of good survival horror elements in it, and introduced more action. The gaming world was evolving and the game had to as well to keep up. Had it not, it still would have kept going on, if nothing else, a cult following, but not many companies would give up a chance for a larger customer base. RE4 is my favorite game from the series (RE1 remake for the gamecube being a very close second). It changed a lot of mainstays about the game, but wasn't overboard yet. RE5, while still fun, wasn't nearly as good as any of the others were (though the co-op offered a bit of fun, though reduced the horror element even further), and RE6 was even worse than RE5 was (Leon's campaign was alright, but the rest was no good). And we also have Operation Raccoon City, not even made by capcom, which was just terrible. I miss the classic games, but I understand why they don't want to do them in today's market. RE4 was a great blend of elements, and it was refreshing, as well. By that point they had already made about 9 games with a nearly identical formula (0, 1, 2, 3, CV; 1 and CV having remakes/revised releases, and CV also having a Survivor version FPS made stemming from it; Gaiden for gameboy, Dead Aim (same controls but first person while shooting) and the Outbreak games which were cool, but also lacked a large following, but their mechanics were pretty much the same as the originals) , so, in my opinion, something fresh was very needed by that point, and considering how many of the parenthetically mentioned titles were flops, I'd say impressively well done and received."

Resentment and attraction are not mutually exclusive. 

Lots of women resent hot guys in suits, but a disproportionate number of feminists still find a way to somehow overcome their resentment and just accidentally marry a man that fits the normal profile of male attractiveness.

If you're having trouble with genuine attraction, that's actually pretty far down the rabbit hole when it comes to human emotional problems. 

Addressing it directly (therapy) or channeling it (kink) are the only two good options. Everything else leads to a bad place, at worst, or spinning in place, at best."

BP is usually used for spot treatments I think, at least that's what I gather from the [sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/spot_treatments).

If your acne originates from clogged pores, then a BHA will help you since it works by penetrating the pores. BHAs also have anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. 

In any case, if you're going to use a new product remember to patch test! That way you can determine if the product works for your skin before applying it everywhere and have it potentially wrecking havoc on your face."

darkhorse92,NoFap,1388603581.0,"I made it through. I had some really close calls where I started to watch porn, but I managed to snap myself out of it and close the browser before I did anything. I was home from college for three weeks of December (still am), so I got to spend a lot of time with my family instead of up in my room fapping like I used to. This is my longest streak so far, and I think a big part is that I'm home with my family where I can't get drunk. At school, the temptation is always there to drink, then if I don't close with a girl, I go home and fap because I'm drunk and don't care. Drinking in moderation instead of excess has made a huge difference and I'm going to force myself to continue to do so when I go back. I've noticed during this streak that I don't ""need"" alcohol to be comfortable in social situations anymore, from flirting with bridesmaids at my cousin's wedding to talking to my parents' friends at a neighborhood party, it just feels so much more natural and flows better. Plus I can look people in the eyes now.

I've made a lot of progress on hand-washing. What I did was focus on maintaining a slight level of ""dirtiness"" at all times. I would deliberately touch things that were ""dirty"" and then make myself deal with it.

I found this approach empowering. I felt like I was in control, as opposed to only resisting the urge when it happened to come up. I was sparking the urge myself, on purpose. That feeling of having control made it a lot easier.

I know what you mean about getting that ""contaminated"" feeling from touching things that aren't even dirty. That's how you know it's OCD talking. It's like a game.

One of the things you should practice is drawing lines in a single, fluid motion - doing so by locking your wrist and pivoting your elbow or shoulder. A way to train this is to draw two points on your canvas and practice drawing a line from one to the other - a single line, without any sketchiness. This is the sort of thing you can do both with your tablet as well as on paper, though as an exercise it will probably help you get used to your tablet quicker as well."

Just_Observational,skyrim,1388603995.0,"Hi! The race depends, I personally prefer Khajit.

But since you've gotten that a hundred times. I'll give you where to go to begin easy and more difficult modding.

More difficult modding - Start by going over to Skyrimmods subreddit, they'll give you the how-to in their FAQ's most likely. PM me if they don't.

I suggest starting with graphics mods such as W.A.T.E.R. or Pure Waters (not both), and Lush Trees and Grass. If you find the gameplay a big bland (especially as a 2h) then I suggest ACE Combat or the ACE Master overhauls. One mod I think is needed is Sky UI, which requires Skyrim Extended Script to be installed. It overhauls the UI into a PC game user interface instead of a console one.

There's a lot of other ones I use at this point but that's a good starting set that'll allow you to enjoy Skyrim for the first time mostly vanilla!

So a list if you're feeling lazy or bouncing between downloads and whatnot..

-Skyrim Extended Script

 -Sky UI

 -Deadly Dragons

 -W.A.T.E.R or Pure Waters (not both)

 -Lush Trees and Grass

Optionally -ACE Master Overhaul (Overhauls 2 non combat and most combat trees)

Easier modding -

Browse steam workshop and find a couple graphical mods and enjoy the game! (Scripting extender is needed for most overhauls)

Hope this helps!"

**The Inframyriad League**

----



**Nerve Lance**
Capable of attacking enemies via their nervous system, he can manipulate and sever another individual's mind from their body- rendering them unable to control themselves. 
He cannot control minds, but he can control someone's body by carefully focusing. He is the ""brains"" of the group, and the tactician alongside Wolf Chill. His disadvantage is the lack of physical prowess, but he can handle a gun and ranged weapons with precision and skill.


**Night Burner**
He draws strength from light, even in the darkness through means of electromagnetic waves, microwaves, radiation, and more. Acting as a catalyst, he can *burn* someone in a confrontation, effectively broiling their body- from inside to out, or even specific body parts. His effect on the environment is negligible, but not to be underestimated. He has trained himself to light fires and manipulate them, but he isn't as skilled as he could be with time. His disadvantage is the lack of perfect control over his fire powers, which can lead to destruction if left unchecked. 

**Steel Construct**
A hulking behemoth of a formless steel golem, Steel Construct is both durable and strong. With his lack of speed he has developed to the point that he can change his form into a protective shield, a bunker, and other constructs.  At times walking into a building may be unwise, as it may just be SC's body you're walking inside- a million ton body press. The rest of his team see him as their protector, but also one that without the rest he'd fall to enemies with time. His weakness is his strength; His hulking form. He can barely move without the aid of his team, but proves invaluable in many occasions. Needs special transportation, in some cases.

**Web Tarantula**
A lascivious woman that has embraced her spiderlike mutations. While in her normal form, she appears to just be a sultry individual. What lurks beneath the depths is a predator, and when her anger takes hold she reveals her true form- A woman with extra arms and blades to slice her opponents to mincemeat. Her disadvantage is her unwillingness to lose or run, which can be an advantage at times.

**Wolf Chill**
The loner of the pack, Wolf Chill opts towards wetwork, spying, assassination, and infiltration. His abilities vary, but almost always specialize in a form of liquid manipulation. He cannot make things hot, like Night Burner can, so their conflicting natures tend to be a focal point of the group's efforts. Some of his notable skills include forming makeshift weapons from moisture in the air, freezing the air someone breathes- causing their lungs to fill with shards of glassy ice, and a combination of Steel Construct's almost liquid steel has led to them pairing up on missions as Wolf Chill's skills can help him move faster. His disadvantage is his disregard of teamwork, at least in most cases.

From personal experience the easiest way to do it is while chatting just mention that you should hang out or grab coffee or drinks sometime, make it low pressure.  Chances are she will say yes the first time as long as you don't try and make it a hollywood datey.  If you are just grabbing coffee or drinks you both can easily say it wasn't a date if it goes terribly due to incompatibility or whatever.

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1388604307.0,"First off, all we are good for is advice and nothing more. The real value comes from experience. It's sort of like reading a book on proper fighting technique vs actually training. The book can help you improve through education, but at the end of the day, you have to try and apply those principles and figure it out yourself. Experience is what's most important. 

If you read everything here, it doesn't mean shit until you start taking action. And with our support, you'll progress much faster. So it's imperative you decide how much progress you want to make. Set your goals now, and understand that how fast you reach them is entirely dependent on how much effort you put into it. Luckily you're in a great position considering that you don't have to force yourself to go out every night, but instead are going out every night because you have to. Now all you have to do is start reading up and applying some of this shit in your daily interactions. 

There really isn't much more that I can add other than what others have said already. But with the limited information I have, this is what I can gather. At the end of the day, you're a man. You wanted to get close to her. That's what's natural. But you didn't because you need to work on some insecurities you got floating around. For some reason or another, you don't feel comfortable letting that side come out, so naturally, you don't understand how to utilize it. My only recommendation is to start forcing yourself to get comfortable with that side. You'll have to start forcing it at first, until you get comfortable with it after you realize it's not a bad side at all, but a great side of you that you've been keeping repressed for too long. You'll find out that women love that side, and men respect it. "

Can you paint? If yes, consider painting the insets of the wall in pic 3. It seems like that wall is very tall? By drawing attention to its entire height you will bring your eye up and notice the tall ceilings of the loft and make it seem bigger. You could do shades of grey and maybe one block in a bright color (yellow, neon something, blue, really any color would look good).

If you can't paint, consider taping some sort of paper inside the insets. You could find vintage wall paper, or old maps. You could go to kinkos and blow up some photographs you've taken or you like and print them out on huge paper. Its not that expensive, and if you did it in black and white it would add attention while being cohesive. And, if you pick a couple of landscape photos, it would feel like you are looking at windows and not a wall. Kind of [this feeling](http://www.color-x.com/wp-content/gallery/museums/13-museum-exhibit-wall-murals-adhesive-vinyl-moma-bontec.jpg) or [this](http://www.artbarblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo_mural_collage2.jpg). That would just make such an impact in that space. Just make sure you use removable tape or very small pins that won't damage the wall. 

I don't know what your budget is, but if you can afford a different couch, that one is not doing you any favors in making the room seem bigger. It is probably extremely comfortable, but is so oversized. Think about a more streamlined couch. Also try flipping the couch and tv set up. Putting the larger couch against the larger wall will make it seem smaller and less overwhelming. You can probably fit a small chair or stool against the far wall between the two doors that could be moved to view the tv or turned toward the couch for conversation. 

I'd also see if you can build a shelf over the tv or get a larger unit to store the record player and speaker instead of having ten different small tables strewn about. Those are just wasting space and making the room look cluttered. If those tables stack do that and only break them out if you need it. Or use them for side tables. You can keep them wood or even spray paint them a fun color if you want to make them look a bit more special. 

I think those changes would make a huge difference in the space. Hope that helps! And be sure to post updated pics with whatever you choose to do with your living room. I can't wait to see how it turns out!

Coachskau,WritingPrompts,1388604386.0,"*The wall next to Thomas exploded, and a Minotaur burst into the room.*

""WHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAT THE FUUUCK?!""

*Thomas jumped to his feet and ran, no thoughts in his mind. His feet were on autopilot, and they were carrying him away from the mythical beast as quickly as possible. The Minotaur barreled after Thomas its war ax gleaming wickedly.*

""WHAT IN THE FUCK IS HAPPENING, HOLY SHIT!!""

*Suddenly, a man wearing a sushi chef outfit and a weird mask dropped down in front of him. He swung his katana at Thomas, who ducked and rolled underneath it. Thomas turned a corner and made for the front of the building.*

""OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!!""

*The two impossible things were hot on his tail, accompanied now by an anthropomorphic cloud of bees and a tour bus. Thomas couldn't comprehend any of this, and he began to go into shock.*

""I NEED TO LEAVE I NEED TO GO THIS IS CRAZY!""

*Thomas slammed through the double doors and stumbled down the stairs in front of the courthouse. A massive tower stood in the distance, and klaxons were wailing all around the open courtyard. Figures in gasmasks and bulletproof vests were heading in his direction, holding bludgeons that crackled with electricity.*

""WH-WHAT?!""

*Thomas ran to his right, just before the things from inside the building careened through the doors and into the crowd of masked people. The bus slammed into a statue in the center of the courtyard, knocking down a screen displaying a glass of milk un-spilling itself in slow motion.*

""FFFAAAAHHHGLARBNAAAHH!!!""

*Thomas's mind had broken past the point of coherence. He ran past open doorways that vomited masked men swinging their stun rods viciously. Thomas vaulted over a fence, just as the Minotaur mowed through the crowd of masked men behind him. He scrambled up a fire escape, then onto the roof of a building. He looked down, and the sushi man was scaling the building quickly.*

""Nnnnnnnnnn...!!""

*Thomas looked around, and a massive blimp rose from the streets below. A woman was in the cabin of the rigid balloon, holding a grenade launcher. She ululated, then launched explosives at Thomas.*

""BWAHHHHHHHHH!!""

*Thomas dove off the building, and landed on a big pile of marshmallows. He jumped up and ran down the street, as a Minotaur, a sushi man, an anthropomorphic cloud of bees, a crowd of masked men, and a tour bus slammed through the wall behind him. The woman in the blimp was firing grenades at him, and Thomas was crying.*

""AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH--uh?""

*Thomas tripped, and fell forward with all of his momentum. He landed on his head, and broke his neck. He died instantly.*

*His pursuers stopped, then looked at eachother. They didn't know what to do. This was supposed to end with Thomas going up into space on a missile that would have exploded on the moon, altering its orbit so significantly that it would have crashed into the Earth, ending life and making for an amazing ending.*

*They milled around for a little while, a few masked men placing Thomas's corpse in a body bag and sending him off to a crematorium. After a couple hours, they were all great friends, and loaded up on the tour bus to go eat together at Chili's.*

Side note regarding eyeliner: actually the one I tried, granted I haven't tried many, with the best staying power was the Ulta brand twist up pencil waterproof eyeliner. Worked better than UD 24/7 (that is soooo baaad on me) and the Sephora brand waterproof. "

Welbeck looked much brighter after he scored and with a very good finish as well. 

The bad:

Wolfengristl,changemyview,1388604920.0,"I agree with all the things you have said here, but I am pro-choice. Is it alive? Based on the 7 characteristics required to categorize something as 'alive,' a fetus is alive. If we found a single bacteria on Mars or anywhere else in the Universe, we would say that we found life on other planets. If a bacteria can fulfill our defintion of 'alive' a fetus certainly can.
But I am pro-choice. Among the many things I learned in my Federal Government class, I learned that any court ruling sets a precedent for court rulings afterwards. For example, one court rules it's okay to cut somebody's hand off for stealing, it is now acceptable and easy for any other courts to rule that way as well. The first court broke through all the legal questions and finally made it okay to cut of its hand, so now other courts can do it to. I am pro-choice because if any court in the United States starts mandating what is okay and not okay for a woman to do to her body, regardless of whether it involves another life, it starts making it okay for the United States courts to begin mandating what other things women (or men) can or cannot do to their bodies. I find this to be quite unnacceptable, given the direction to police state we seem to be heading. I will try to stave that off as long as possible. I do feel bad for the fetus, but there is more at stake for 'Real People' than there is for a creature that has not been born yet.

Who knows what kind of thinking op has done on the subject, and with my luck he's got an advanced degree in some field that'll blow me away if he (isn't there a common, unsexed pronoun for he/she yet. fuck's sake) comes to read that I downvoted him.  

I want to see a higher level of thinking here.  When I consider the complexity of problems humanity has solved over the last century I see the amount of oil (I think of oil as a decent proxy for resource production) we've burned and the climate change that we've affected as a terrible, but probably worthwhile, cost.  I don't know much about the whole thing, but it's a bit more complex than us fucking the earth.

I hope we can spend the next 100 years making as much progress for half the cost.  I'd be a proud great great grandfather if, 100 years from now, the externalities people cause are so vastly reduced that our descendants can no longer relate to the way that we used the earth's resources in the early 21st century.  

So, I actually hope op is right that people won't be able to relate, but I also hope that they understand the complexities of life enough to not write us off."

But we are so fucking transparent it's embarrassing. Everyone fucking knows that we're going to ping it to our wingers, (who cannot cross) and then they'll try in vain to get a ball in.

arrise,buildapcforme,1388605125.0,"Alright I'll break everything down for you here, I make all my builds with upgrades in mind. 

CPU: I-5 4 core 3.4GHz, pretty much the standard in high end gaming an I5 will handle anything out there at max settings. In addition to this it fits into a LGA 1155 socket which means it is easily replaced with an I7 Processor.

Motherboard: Built by Asus a company known for their quality, has 4 RAM slots and I'm only making you use one. Allowing you to add more RAM down the road, it supports 32 GBs total. It has 2 PCI-e x16 slots allowing you to add a second graphics card later on and fully supports Crossfire and SLI.

Memory: 1 8GB RAM module at 1600MHz is fast and built by a reliable company, only having 1 allows you to buy another down the road and still have slots in your motherboard.

Storage: Seagate make high quality drives, 1TB is a good starting drive because even with quite a few games, movies and songs it will take awhile to fill up. The Motherboard has several SATA connectors allowing you to easily add another drive and expand space.

Video Card: Sapphire make good quality GPUs, I choose this particular card because it is comparably ~20% more powerful than the Nvidia 660, the other card offered at this price range. This is a powerful card, and should allow for ~60 fps on ultra on modern games (BF4, Skyrim). In addition all AMD GPU's come with a few free games, allowing you to jump right into PC gaming.

Case: Fairly well built, this case as 2 front USBs as you requested and has good reviews.

Power Supply: Corsair are known for good parts, the 80+ Bronze sticker means that it is certified good quality and the 600W allows for the upgrade of a few parts before you need to purchase a larger one.

Optical drive: Again Asus, also allows you to write to DVD and CD.

OS: Windows 8.1 is fast, reliable and generally what I would recommend for people just getting into PC gaming.

Monitor: Acer, not the best brand but a good price for a 23"" 1080p monitor, of all the parts the one I would recommend spending a little extra if possible to get something for a better brand."

Weight: 5'8 135lbs to 5'8 160lbs 

Bench: 65lbs to 165lbs (5x5)

Squat: 95lbs to 240lbs (5x5)

Deadlift: 135lbs to 280lbs (1x5) 

OHP: 40lbs to 105lbs (5x5) 

So, I hit both my goals even though I just barely made it into the intermediate weights. The best thing is that this was a great learning experience that built a foundation for future goals, both in terms of strength and education. Obviously, I stumbled around a lot when I first began but I learned how to closely monitor my diet to a level where it feels fairly natural to me and also understand my body's mechanics work. I've also become the guy who is ""getting too big"" which I like to look at as the glass half full. 

Next year's goals will be to hit the 1000 club and gain 15 more pounds of mostly lean mass. Hope to have another great year! "

Basically, in the books, while the hobbits were gone, Saruman had sent Men to take over the Shire - that's why there was good pipeweed in the wreckage of Isengard.  But when Isengard fell, Saruman and Wormtongue fled to the Shire.  When Frodo and the hobbits returned, they discovered the hobbits being oppressed and someone called Old Sharky living in Bag End.  (Sharky, Tolkien footnotes, comes from *sharku*, the orcish word for old man).  So  the hobbits revolt against the Men and confront Saruman at Bag End.  They're about to kill him, but Frodo takes pity on him and lets him go.  As he is leaving, he's verbally abusing Wormtongue, who has finally had enough.   He draws a dagger and stabs Saruman repeatedly, and is then killed by the hobbits.

tricksy_trixie,MakeupAddicts,1388605464.0,"So Baby Skin (BS) vs. Smashbox Photo Finish Primer (SB). I heard they were similar and I have a sample size SB primer that I like, so I wanted to see how BS stacked up.

Picture two has a small amount of each product side by side, you can see that the SB is a bit more translucent and the BS is a bit more transparent.

Picture three is a side shot of the two dollops, you can see that the SB one kept its upright shape and the BS almost did but kind of sagged over a bit. The BS formula is a little bit thinner than the SB, but not by much. 

Ingredient comparison - not as similar as I was led to believe, but hey I'm no chemist so maybe some of these sciencey names are actually the same stuff. And I don't know if cosmetics follow the same rules as food in listing the most prevalent ingredients first so it's hard to tell about formulation. Basically, they're not identical and I think I read somewhere that they were. 

I put the SB on my left cheek and the BS on my right cheek and the rest of my face. Felt pretty similar going on and didn't notice any visible difference. After I let it sit for a couple minutes (during which I tried and failed miserably at the Maybelline gel liner... definitely need more practice), the SB cheek looked dry and flaky (I have this problem on my cheeks in winter) but the BS side looked and felt noticeably smoother. After I put my powder over everything, same thing, BS side feels way smoother than the SB side.

I don't wear liquid foundation so I can't really speak to the staying power of each primer.

Verdict - I'll take a few more days to decide, and switch between the SB and BS for a while, but so far BS is winning in both performance and price."

Texting isn't  hinting it's just small talk and a chance to see if he's a douche or a decent guy.

I'd think it's smalltalk and you're not even on my radar. I only date people who have confidence to clearly show me they like me as more than a friend. Until that happens, she's not even on my radar.

Now, onto the cat thing.....that is a FUCKING MAJOR RED FLAG.  Not ok.  He kicked your cat across the room, what the fuck good would that do in any concept?



You have nothing to apologize for and spending any more time with him is a waste of your life.  With him being your first and only and after all these years it won't be easy, but it needs to be done.

silverionmox,FeMRADebates,1388605924.0,"&gt;  People in power should be representative of the demographics of the ones they rule.

I disagree. 

- This would require toddlers, mentally handicapped, coma patients etc. to get into office, which is obviously silly. We can and do represent the interests of other people.

- We naturally want those people who are better than average to lead, even if circumstances cause the chances for self-improvement to be distributed unevenly.

- Selecting the leadership on basis of what they are rather than what they do, on how many people they can motivate undermines meritocratic ideals and restricts freedom of choice of political representation. It ultimately introduces and legitimizes selection of people in power based on inborn traits rather than merit or democratic mandate.

- Those groups aren't necessarily better served if one of them is in office... For example, Pakistan has had a female Prime Minister, but obviously the position of women in Pakistan is not better than in, say, France.

- People in power should represent everyone. If white men in power would predominantly take care of white men, you'd call it unacceptable, rightly so. It's no any less unacceptable if black women in power were to take care of black women first and foremost. We shouldn't legitimize politics that aim to serve one group better than others.

I *do* agree that an imbalance in demographics is a red flag and warrants further inquiry. That inquiry *may* turn indicate an injustice, but that should be addressed in other ways. Sometimes there are no quick solutions. For example, children growing up in poverty have a bigger chance to end up back in poverty than everyone else. Therefore a poor demographic will be underrepresented, but they're not going to benefit from having one of their underqualified representatives pushed into a position of power."

If you want to practice adding trim, and you are going for a play on a traditional east coast look you should do [a paneled look instead](http://blog.wainscotsolutions.net/files/2010/08/gray-molding.jpg).

Are you keeping the tv? If no, you could always rotate the bed against the wall where the dresser is. That might make it seem bigger because more of the windows will be seen and that will draw your eye outside, making the room feel bigger. 

Either way, you can probably fit a smallish chair against the wall between the bed and closet. 

You could also [try vertical trim](http://media-cache-cd0.pinimg.com/736x/ac/b5/5c/acb55c18cb929f540a856f4d3532987c.jpg) throughout the room to make the ceiling appear taller. Its a simple look that can be both modern and traditional at the same time. 

Also, don't do a bed frame with thick sides. You don't have the space for a platform all around. Just focus on making an interesting headboard (again, I'd go with the rustic wood look for it).

BrandNewSidewalk,AskWomen,1388606031.0,"I had a ""Man of Honor"".  He was my best friend from college, and as I don't really have a ""best"" female friend, I asked him to stand up with me if his wife would let him, and thankfully she agreed.  My MIL was not crazy about the idea, but as soon as she met him, she was fine with it.  It all went really well, and I am so glad he was there.

As others have said, just ask her what she wants you to do.  In our case, I had a matron of honor (married female cousin) who held my bouquet during the ceremony, adjusted my train, etc, while my man of honor held my husband's wedding band for me.  As both man and matron of honor were from out of town, my two local bridesmaids took over the bachelorette party.  Man of honor opted to not attend our spa day, which was fine with me, although we did include his wife.  My shower was thrown by an older friend of my mom's.  As far as showers, parties, etc, just ask what she wants!  Every bride is different, and every bride has different expectations.  I was pretty low-maintenance, but I don't know your friend so it's really hard to say one way or another.

Expect that in a few months you will probably need to be fitted for a tux.  I chose to have my Man of Honor dress like our groomsmen, but he had a special boutineer.  

Something to keep in mind closer to the big day is to make sure the bride gives specific instructions to her photographer regarding group pictures!  (And all pictures, really.  Never assume your photographer knows which photos you want taken.)  I discussed our wedding party with my photographer at length, but all day long he kept trying to place my ManofHonor with the groomsmen in group photos.  I had to be like ""nooo he's MINE"".  :)  So just make sure she's clear about that in advance so that there isn't any confusion the day of.  She will have so much on her mind.

To me, the people I asked to stand up with me were there because they were the ones I wanted with me on a very special but very stressful day.  My bridesmaids/man of honor slipped me skittles when I was having low blood sugar, fanned me with little battery operated fans while we were standing in the summer heat waiting for pictures, and spoonfed me ice cream after the ceremony while my dress was being bustled.  It was a crazy day in so many ways, but I am so glad that I had that group with me.  

Specifically, my Man of Honor was the friend I wanted to hold my hand and calm me down, pray with me, and tell me that everything was going to be fine, throughout the planning process and on the day of.  **Be the friend that you always are to her, and you can't go wrong.** (Hint: that's why she chose you!)  :)"

Getting out of such a situation is immensely more complicated for some women because they aren't usually the breadwinner. And let's remember that women from more traditional religions are also socialized that they have to ""obey"" their husband (per marriage vows). Forgiveness is something they will emphasize to women too.

Stick to your guns and move on. It doesn't matter what her explanation is - explanations don't change the nature of a relationship.

True, there may be a very good reason why she can never be in a relationship with you, but that doesn't change the fact that you are not okay with this arrangement.

Howard (the guy he's talking to) was Home Secretary at the time (roughly equivalent to US Secretary of State). At the time, there was a controversy with prominent IRA members escaping from max security prisons, possibly with help from supportive prison officials.

The director of the prison service at the time was Derek Lewis, and he'd fired some minor prison officials. Howard wanted to remove some higher-ups, specifically John Marriott, the governor of Parkhurst prison. 

Howard met with Lewis, and Marriott was suspended. Paxman is implying that Howard gave Lewis the ultimatum to remove Marriott,  or Howard would go over his head and remove Marriott himself (embarrassing Lewis in the process)."

Don't get into a big explanation about how good you think the two of you would be a relationships and yadda yadda.  If she agrees, you have no reason to bring it up.  If she doesn't, you don't want to scare her away.


Just casually ask something along the lines of ""So I was wondering if you'd want to go out on a date some night.  Dinner at [restaurant] then [dancing/movie/other fun activity] at [place]"".  If she says no, just take it as no and don't act any different around her.  That way it won't make the friendship awkward.  If she says no, absolutely DO NOT try to give her all of your reasoning behind it or explaining your thought process, that will make things awkward.  You have already planted the idea and that's all you need to do, if she's interested or is ever to become interested it won't be by being convinced by you.



Now, if she says yes-success!  First step is under way.  Go out and have a great time.  Don't over think it.  Tell her you had a fun time and ask if she wants to do it again sometime.  Tell her you like her.  Do not say you love her or go into some really big explanation about it.  Keep it simple in the beginning, and if things progress and she's showing interest in making it something more, then bring that stuff up.

Escape92,changemyview,1388606480.0,"I'm not the op but i have thought about this a lot in the past, and the reasons against adoption are multiple.

1. You still have to go through 9 months of pregnancy and labour. Women with issues of substance abuse could potentially harm that foetus, even if they didn't want to. Pregnancy creates a hormonal maelstrom inside a woman, which could be harmful to someone with mental health issues, especially if they are not then planning on keeping the baby, and labour is not a trifle, it's a serious experience which can last for hours and cause pain and damage. That's a lot to go through for a child you are not keeping.

2. Lots of children which are put up for adoption fail to find suitable homes and end up in the care of the state.

3. If I were having kids I would want to be their parent. To know my baby was out there and would never call me mum is a huge deal for me."

There were no directions or space, or even time or duration  before the big bang. Space and dimensions began existing at the big bang. They also began expanding. And accelerating that expansion.

 There was no spatial point for the big bang to happen *at* before the big bang. The Wikipedia article is actually pretty good on this, but maybe other people could recommend even better articles or explanations. 

The shape of the universe isn't spherical. There is some debate about it though. I side with one of the views that says there is a finite amount of space, and it loops back on itself at some point, imperceptible from 3 dimensions. Another view says that the universe has an infinite size but I think that is actually nonsensical, because infinity is not a *number* and it would mean that the number of distance units in the universe was infinite. You can't have an infinite number in the physical universe;it's not that sort of mathematical concept. "

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388606550.0,"&gt; By the way, how is it ""you care"", when it's not your money but the money taken by force of law and sever punishment from everyone else?

You seem to forget that without government, there could be no money, no financial system, at least not a good one. In absence of government, business BECOME government.

The concept of the social contract is that you give up some of your freedom to join civilization, and get away from a darwinist state of things, which, as Thomas Hobbes described, is ""nasty brutish and short."" And since government needs to be funded, you need taxation. And it just expanded from there where government also does the job of services the private sector fails at. And I'm okay with that, as it enhances our existence.

I think Barack obama said it right when he said ""you didn't build that."" 

I think what it comes down to is i have a different idea of rights than you. I don't buy into the enlightenment stuff about them being self evident and stuff, because as evidenced by human history, they're not. Not even life. The universe guarantees you nothing, owes you nothing. Even your sacred cow of private property is a social construction. Ever heard of the !Kung San? They're a tribal group that lives in the South African desert. They have no concept of property. To some, property is a form of enslavement in a way, actually, and is the source of many worries in life. Now, I'm not saying we should become LIKE the !Kung San, but property rights are socially constructed, and quite frankly, wouldn't exist without a system that formally recognizes them. And honestly, that system is government, and our rules can change."

RandianHero,GunsAreCool,1388606719.0,"The levels of violence have tapered off since the 1990s, which is about all you can really hope for in areas where people have barricaded themselves into ideological camps. You can restrict access to weapons all you want, but at the end of the day, the violence is going to continue regardless of who gets their hands on what. Homemade explosives are cheap, effective, easy to assemble, and don't require illegal components. Poison can be developed from simple household items. Cars can be used to deadly effect by anyone.

The solution isn't to attack the mechanisms of violence; that's been proven time and time again to be an ineffective strategy at combating the actual problems underlying the violence. The solution is to come to a consensus between the two factions that push extremists out of the realm of sympathy and into the realm of public enemies: more often than not, the solution is purely one of resources. Poor people will always kill poor people. Rich people don't need to kill other rich people. Case in point: the same factions of people exist in places like the UAE, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, but the sectarian violence in those places isn't anywhere *near* as bad as Iraq or Syria. Same thing with America or Canada: Catholics and Protestants live together, marry together, and share similar perceptions about life. Fix the economics and the ideological problems go away. Maybe not entirely, and maybe not overnight. But they do get to a point where it's no longer business as usual."

ernestborgnine2013,AskFeminists,1388606775.0,"&gt; You can't say something like ""men are more likely to beat their wives, so women getting more maternity leave is justified"". 

I don't say that. Maternity and paternity leave should be equal.

I am concerned about domestic violence because women are primarily the victims in domestic violence and it's a cycle that repeats itself in generation after generation. If a son sees his father hitting his wife, he is more likely to do it to his wife. How do we break this cycle? Why isn't there more of a social stigma to hitting your wife? Probably can't do anything with public policy that hasn't already been done (but I am not up on the policy issue) - however, as a society, this is a critical question facing gender relations."

shelleythefox,AskWomen,1388606850.0,"I married a man who doesn't have a lot of social graces. My extended family pretty much considers him a lazy loser who makes excuses. I don't think he is, he's actually a very smart man, but he doesn't like dealing with foolish superficial people, so he doesn't.

He's also a very stubborn man who refuses to compromise his values in order to get ahead in life. I knew this before I married him, and I knew it would make life harder, but I respect him for sticking to his guns.

We got married pretty young (22) and decided to start a family relatively soon. We met in Sept '02, married in Nov '06, had our oldest in Jan '09. This is because I'd like 4 children, and I wanted to have them before I turned 30. Won't quite make it, but it will be close. Our 3rd child is 4 months old.

He works for my parents to keep a roof over our heads, we're trying to start a photography business to get ahead and be able to do that doing something we love and be together, and he is a philosopher and works on that in his free time.

We both have our bachelor's, he in Philosophy, me in Art, and we like to do things involving that, but we haven't been able to make a living off it.


TL;DR~ I married a man who refused to do any old grunt work for crappy pay because he felt his time would be better served at home with his wife and helping raise his children. So we're rather poor all while building a family. I could've married a different man, I guess, but I wanted this one. I could've waited to have kids or not have so many, but I wanted to follow my dream. I don't consider being a poor a permanent state, as I feel finances ebb and flow in most people's lives. "

IamNotShort,infj,1388606892.0,"I looked at the book a bit and decided I won't. I've done quite a bit of reading, and at this point when I approach a new book like this I either find it wrong, unhelpful, or in this case, something I've already figured out from my other books. As for your questions:

Creating myself has always been an extremely difficult painful thing to do. Ever since I realized that it was up to me who I became, I've become aware that I don't fit in anywhere. This isn't a simple whining about not belonging, I've noted that I've made friends with various groups of people who have nothing to do with each other, and at any given time I only eel like I half belong in anyone of them. I've made myself into someone who can go anywhere but never really get there.

What makes me happy... I can't. Not really. I'm happy around my friends. I'm happy reading. I'm happy being alone. But not really. If I'm lucky I get fleeting moments of feeling happy, but normally I'm trying to be content. When I'm doing something like this, I get lost in what I'm trying to do and it doesn't matter how I feel, I just have a purpose.

Nothing keeps me enthusiastic. This is not for lack of looking, I suspect something is very much wrong, more than just my ADHD and probably linked to my chronic depression. It is impossible for me to stay enthusiastic about something, no matter how much I care about it. This makes it almost impossible to do anything for myself, so I end up trying to do things for other people, that way there is a reason for me to keep going. 

My life is deep thoughts. With out them I do nothing but lay in bed watching doctor who (Not that there is anything wrong with that). I have to keep considering the ever changing meaning of life, or I lose grip of why I'm doing what I am. Over this break I was planning on doing a big big project for school, but I ended up being too tired to think about why I wanted to do it, so I lost it and I never got to. I have to do things for other people to care enough to keep going. But when no one else care as much about what I do for them as I do it's hard to keep going."

Trudeau was answering a question on separatism, bilingualism, French and Bill 101.

Maklodes,AskHistorians,1388607425.0,"Thanks for the reply! I just have a few questions.

&gt; You have things a bit backward here. The Western European marriage model was largely driven by economic factors, not the source of those factors. Later marriage by peasants was predicated on the need for self-sufficiency by a new couple.

What economic factors applied outside of the Hajnal line that allowed peasants to be self-sufficient in spite of earlier marriage?

&gt; Explaining the difference in urbanization between the East and West goes back much farther, and is a situation that existed since the times of the Roman Empire. The decline of the Empire in the west played a significant role in the reduction in urbanization there, adding to the already less urbanized character of the region.

I realize that Western Europe was fairly rural in comparison to more eastern areas of Eurasia (outside of the Central Asian steppe climate) like Greece, Egypt, China, etc, centuries before Rome was a significant power, but at the same time, I'm not sure I feel comfortable attributing lack of urbanization in Western Europe to a built-in historical lag in urbanization. Relatively new historical cities such as Baghdad and Cairo could reach high populations quite quickly (i.e., within a century or two). Leaving aside the fact that Western Europe wasn't very urban in 500 BC (say), was there something about Western Europe (geographically, economically, or politically) unfriendly to urban growth?

&gt; Peasants were all technically landless. 

I think there were some peasant classes that had land (e.g., the Yeoman/Franklin class in England, kulaks in Russia), but it's a fair point that I was talking more about lack of land to be cultivated (at least for a rent that left the peasant with enough to live), not lack of land to be owned.

&gt; You would think that more peasants would mean more pressure for urbanization, and you would be partly correct. Cities like Paris and London grew quite a lot during the pre-black death population boom. On the other hand, population increases also had a negative effect on peasant mobility because it meant they had less bargaining power for their labour.

How did lack of bargaining power lead to reduced mobility per se? It seems to me that what would drive mobility would not be so much lower bargaining power per se, but geographic differentiation in bargaining power. Neither universal poverty nor universal prosperity would lead to great mobility to the extent that great demand for labor in one region (a newly drained swamp turned into farmland, an urbanizing city) juxtaposed with poverty in another area (e.g., a well-established, densely populated rural manor)

&gt; However, I think what it comes down to is your interpretation that peasants would be moving to cities to seek their fortune is at its core a flawed idea. Peasants were more likely to turn to brigandry than move to an urban area. It wasn't until the industrial revolution that Western Europe started to see in a large quantity type of urban growth you are talking about, and more importantly, the demographic shift from rural to urban. Despite the greater freedom I outlined above, huge numbers of peasants didn't flock to Paris and London. The population of Paris remained roughly 200,000 from 1200 to 1650, despite the population of France rising and falling with the plague outbreak and internal strife. Medieval European cities could only support a certain size population with the industrial output and jobs during that period. Cities like Rome only grew to the size they did during the medieval period thanks to extensive grain doles. It would not be until the industrial revolution that peasant mobility would result in a mass shift to urban areas for Western Europe.

So I suppose the question is, why were other Eurasian areas able to urbanize to a significantly greater extent prior to the Industrial revolution?

Now, that being said, I do think arming people in a region rife with sectarian violence is a stupid idea, because it's adding fuel to a fire. But I'm also not going to pretend that disarming them so will even put a dent in the overall problem. So realistically, it's not even a solution.

a) How we accepted and stood by while our right to privacy was eroded, and the degree of acceptance of control of government and corporations over our communication.

or

b) Why we cared so much about privacy and freedom in the first place.

The latter will come about if we fail to establish the legal right to privacy, and lack of privacy/freedom becomes so mainstream that people in the future don't even know what it is like having privacy/freedom."

The mild accents of the trolls and the goblin king were laughably bad, I use it there. I think creatures of a different race speaking a foreign tongue should sound a bit different than a dialect accent...

Second, you mentioned that a feature to add shops would come soon. This is an absolute must. Since as of right now there are zero shops listed in my area (Washington DC), this app is essentially useless to me. 

I wonder what else you will show as far as the shops go and how much control you will give to the shops to update their listings. It might be a good feature to allow access to the shops so that they can give their menus, prices, events, etc. as well as having review features from other users.

Well, no shit. It's rather rare that an ambitious policy is more complex than simply stating it outright. Privatization of public services, for example, falls into the category too. 

The question you raise are perfectly answerable though the answer depends on the answerer's values.

As far as I'm concerned, a basic income would be fixed. It wouldn't vary based on geography or other concerns *except* the number of dependents. Varying costs based on geography would be inefficient, rewarding individuals who can't find cheap housing by themselves. 

The specific amount of basic income granted would be set by politicians, though probably informed by government economists who have laid out the cost of different degrees of generosity and the estimate welfare of recipients, for each considered amounts. In other words, the process would be very similar to decision of other forms of financial aid (welfare, student aid, etc.). We're already doing decisions like this. It would be nothing new.

Finally, on the subject of the CRA audit, we already have mechanism around these lines for welfare. It would be, there again, the continuation of the past. It would be nothing new. Besides, consolidating tax fraud to the CRA is the simplest solution. Tax fraud is, after all, tax fraud. "

And I'm also 25! :)

I gave up soda as my New Years resolution in 2009. It's a HARD habit to kick. Very hard. I started by subbing Splenda sweetened iced tea for soda, when I craved it (almost constantly at first). I made sure to get a glass of water whenever we went out to eat (we eat out a lot). I would drink the glass of water and get another. If I was still thirsty THEN I would let myself have a tea. After a while I stopped with Splenda and just had unsweetened tea. I weaned myself off of that and finally just got water. I've started back with the iced tea since starting my job, I don't drink coffee and some days you NEED caffeine. 

I haven't had soda since 12/31/2009. You can do it too! I miss it some days, most days I don't even think about it. Eventually you'll get there too!

I get approached by guys sometimes, and honestly, as flattering as it might be, it's usually pretty uncomfortable -- and not just because I'm not gay either. 

What you probably don't realize, if you've never been approached by a guy, is how awkward a lot of them are about it. Props for having the courage, of course -- I'm fully aware of how difficult that can be -- but it's strange, because he's probably being very friendly, except you have no idea how genuine it is or whether he remotely cares about anything you're saying (and their effort to appear interested often comes across as patronising, because bear in mind, he approached based on how you look, not because he was able to sense your great personality and intellect from across the room), and you can't just say ""sorry dude, I'm not interested"", because he probably hasn't explicitly stated his intentions, so that would be presumptuous.

ender2021,changemyview,1388608928.0,"The biggest problem is that your theory does not even come close to satisfying [Occam's Razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor).  Such a razor is a logical principle (or tool) in philosophy which allows you to ""slice away"" unlikely theories in regards to a given phenomenon.  Of course, these are not absolute logical laws, but can be excellent guidelines in selecting the theory most likely to be correct.  Occam's Razor states that when selecting from competing hypotheses, you should select the one with the fewest assumptions.  Let's use it to examine the two explanations for crop circles present in your argument:

The theory that some bored/disturbed/whatever human person makes them for some reason only requires the assumption that such a human person exists and is so motivated.  In point of fact, this isn't even an assumption, because some such people have publicly admitted their own existence.  We know for an absolute fact that this theory is correct in at least some instances of crop circles.

The theory that extraterrestrials are using crop circles to communicate requires several assumptions:

1. That extraterrestrials exist.  This is a pretty big one, given the complete lack of any direct evidence despite concerted efforts to locate said evidence.
2. That they have both the interest and the technology to communicate with us.
3. That they are incapable of or uninterested in more direct, obvious, and/or understandable communication.

There are probably even more assumptions to list, and each of the ones I listed could be broken down into a subset of other assumptions as well.  This is not to say that these couldn't all be true - they very well could be, as we have no real concrete evidence to suggest that they are NOT correct.  However, we also lack evidence to support the claim that they are correct.

I guess what I'm saying is that I can't actually prove to you that your theory is wrong - because it actually could be correct.  However, it requires so many unsubstantiated assumptions that you could just as easily believe any other non-disprovable theory.  If we were lacking any other explanation for these occurrences, it might be acceptable (if inconclusive) to rest with the ET theory.  Because we have a perfectly reasonable, non-assumptive theory that is known to be correct in at least some instances, it would be exceptionally illogical to reject that theory in favor of one requiring many assumptions.

In this particular case, I think that's about as close to the truth as you're going to get."

seanomenon,alcoholism,1388609018.0,"Alcoholism and other addictions are about a lot of different things. But at the heart of the problem there tends to be a compulsion for immediate gratification. A desire for pleasure, via a drink, a drug, a winning hand, a risk, an orgasm. It has to be now, it has to be intense, and when its over we want more. To a certain degree this is true of humans in general, its just turned up to 11 for some of us. 

Breakups are hard, they can be infuriating and depressing and liberating all at once. Someone with a healthy mentality just deals with it, gives themselves some time, and moves on. An active alcoholic is going to seek immediate relief from the loneliness, at the bottom of a glass or with a random hookup (or both.) It isn't healthy or sane, and that's the point. Sex addicts engage in risky behavior to get a thrill the same way drunks engage in risky behavior to get a buzz. (And for what its worth, there are plenty of women sex addicts and women who cheat. Risk-taking and infidelity are not exclusive to men.)

An active addict can also get into a ""fuck it"" mindset. Things went south? I screwed up my life? Fuck it, why not go all out. Let's get another bottle, let's get some drugs, let's sleep with the next warm willing body we can find. Fuck it.

Did he cheat on you when you were together? Only he knows. Was he actually bi-curious? I assume yes, since he experimented with it. Was it a good idea for you to leave him? Yes, no doubt about it. Is it healthy for you to follow his activity now? I don't think so. 

IMHO, I think you should move on. You dodged a bullet and made a wise choice to leave this guy. It would also be wise to get full STD tests as soon as you can. Now actually move on, leave him behind you.

Good luck."

Something that really excites me is the ""Tutorials/Lessons"" section.  I was just thinking about trying to find ways to make SpaceX more accessible to everyone, and I think that some tutorials would be a great way to do so.  Ideally, the best medium for the tutorials, in my opinion, would be some Khan-Academy-style videos that are easy to follow, engaging, and fun to watch.  

Also, the tutorials should rely heavily on pictures/gifs/illustrations, and equations should be presented in a friendly manner, or sort of put off to the side.  For instance, you can show the average layman [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Geostationaryjava3D.gif) and now they instantly have an intuition for how GEO works.  Throw in some comments about how this only works for an orbit which is a certain distance away from the earth and that moves around the equator, and then challenge the mathematically-inclined viewer to verify that the orbital radius is in fact 35,786 km and briefly show the necessary equations on the screen before moving on.  That way it's like a choose-your-own-adventure, where the viewer can decide whether they want to get an intuitive feeling for the topic, or some in-depth mathematical practice.

He's going to come up with something else -- something that's probably going to cause a lot more collateral damage. 

Restricting their guns only delays the killing, it doesn't prevent it. So it's not a real solution. And with all the senseless killing in the world, these absurd non-solutions need to stop.

TheLittleGoodWolf,MensRights,1388609178.0,"&gt; Difference with the tribe example can be hinted at in other species of mammals. The tribe with mostly men would simply wipeout the young of others and take did their own the women. Men are physically (we're talking averages here) stronger and if groups of matrifocalists think that kind of BS would stand, they'd be in for a rather violent awakening.

I'm not sure if we agree on my example or not, or what you want to say with this. What kind of BS are you talking about? I'm not implying that what you are saying is BS, just seeking clarity as to the *kind* of BS you are talking *about*.

&gt;Back to the topic? Women are the weaker sex. There are exceptions in both cases but reality backs up this assertion. Physical strength is needed in combat situations. The ability to endure whilst carrying a wounded team member along with your and his gear (worst case scenario) is far less viable when dealing with a female vs male physiology. Again, exceptions always exist... But that's all they are. 

This is of course also true.

It's not where you get certified (though they offer certificate programs) and it's not about preparing you to do one thing. Typically BA/BS degrees are holistic approaches to educating you by offering a diverse range of subjects, ideas and experiences. This is consistent with modern theories about pedagogy, public education and the role of a university in society.

Similar to what one respondent said elsewhere, all of my electives and gen eds offered me something useful and interesting that made me a better thinker, so long as I was willing to experience that. Students who take the attitude ""I shouldn't have to study anything outside my area of interest"" are being particularly narrow minded and ignorant when we depend on interdisciplinary approaches to problems in science, academia and industry.

Hence the activism.

But nobody ever has any backing for statements like that. The insist that he's the best because DC made him the best, but I've *never* seen the comics take it to the extreme that the fans have. The comics have him fight and nearly lose to an amnesiac, dying Val Armorr; the fans have him be hands-down the greatest martial artist in DC, bar none.

Another thing H&amp;M is a great place to start looking good. Clothes are cheap so if it doesn't look good you don't waste money and if it does look for better options. The quality is iffy, but that's good.

There is no way to 100% successfully ""close"" and so you must take chances.

You are going to see some awkward situations. For all of the crowing about ""equality,"" women will not initiate and will not take these kinds of risks, and they love having situations where they maintain plausibile deniability. That's how it is. That girl that you talked to was probably looking to fuck when she agreed to come back with you alone, but then again maybe not. Once again, plausible deniability. All you can do is test her actual willingness by escalating and hope for the best.

Other than that just work on things that will improve your chance of success. Mostly your body shape, because your chances of getting laid and from there starting any kind of genuine relations that aren't based on parasitism (the ""AFBB"" model as it's called) are based on what you look like, whether you like this or not. Chances are you're not going to see any kind of crazy improvements in success rate unless you were really out of shape, and this is fine. You don't live in a movie and you're probably not a rich, model-handsome guy. Very few guys have near 100% success rates. Again, this is normal. 

Even that bar regular was just making smalltalk and doesn't have that great of success rate. He probably assessed the situation just like I did, though, based on the information he had. Girl left with you, probably a good chance she was down to fuck but you didn't try to escalate. You miss 100% of shots you don't take, as it goes."

Mises's interpretation of democracy is more like federalism and secessionism, because he argued that every political unit must be able to freely join and secede from largely political units, theoretically down to the individual. It's not the same as democracy as commonly understood and rightly condemned by smart fellows such as Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn. (Incidentally, he still retained limited democratic elements in his description of the ideal polity.)

The Hoppe comments that weird me out isn't so much his opposition to democracy as he understands it but rather some of his social views. A bit reactionary for my tastes.

calexanderj,relationships,1388610380.0,"If you don't tell her, things will almost certainly continue as they've been. So if you want things to change you're going to have to do something.

If you tell her, you have to be prepared for the possibility that she doesn't feel the same way. IF you bring it up the right way, things will only be awkward if you make them awkward, so do you think you can stay her friend if she's not interested, and if not, is it still worth it to you to make a move?

You've been friends for 6 years, you've ""hooked up"" a bunch, it seems like it shouldn't be that hard to have a casual conversation about a potential relationship.  You don't need to come right out and say ""I've had feelings for you for the past 6 years"", but during a conversation, you could ask her ""why do you think we never got together?"", or ""X told me back in college, that you said you would never date me, I'm a little offended by that"" (said jokingly)  and see where the conversation goes from there, ask her why she said, and if the reasons are still valid, etc.. Or you could just ask her on a date, ""hey I got tickets to X, I'd like to take you but it will be date"".  The key is to bring it up in such a way that she feels comfortable giving you an honest answer and if she isn't interested she doesn't feel like she'll need to avoid you because you'll be weird or won't take no for an answer."

1. They do that hands-in-the-air look around with a disgusted expression, as if looking for another register to point out to those dumb employees.
1. Bitch us out for our ""horrible business practices"" for not being better prepared with more registers. (Of note: Other than Christmas and back-to-school sales, we were barely doing enough business to stay open. That's why we didn't invest in more registers)
1. Scream at us to go get more registers and open them up. Like we're keeping extra registers in the Magical Back Room, but we're just too lazy to bring them out.

spunky-omelette,SkincareAddiction,1388610580.0,"I also kind of feel like $16 is a bit pricey for a face mask, but if it works for you that's fantastic!  Here are some of my favorite ""affordable"" face masks: 

* **TURMERIC** - This is my darling, I love it so much, and it's definitely well-liked on this sub too. I mix turmeric with full-fat greek yogurt (the lactic acid is good for your skin, and it helps prevent staining), and sometimes I put in some colloidal oatmeal and honey. The turmeric comes in a large amount, colloidal oatmeal is just oatmeal ground into a powder, so the highest ""expense"" is your yogurt (which I keep around to eat, yum!)

* **Aztec Healing Clay** - So the [jar on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Aztec-Secret-Indian-Healing-Cleansing/dp/B0014P8L9W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388610227&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=aztec+healing+clay) is like $7, but it's a pound and lasts forever. I combine mine with Bragg's apple cider vinegar, which is like $4-5. Considering how many uses I get out of this, I'd say it's affordable.

* **Rice Flour** - I don't do this too often, sometimes as a follow-up mask to the turmeric mask. I mix some rice flour with honey and sometimes milk or tea (I drink so much tea, there's always something I can brew up) - never black tea though, usually herbal, green, or white.

* **Avocado** - ... Don't know if this counts, but sometimes a girl just wants to smush avocado all over her face. Don't judge. Sometimes I mix in a bit of honey.

I've come a long way since I first asked /r/skincareaddiction if I could eat a used face mask. :(  If I want a little extra ""oomph"" I'll add maybe a couple of drops of tea tree oil or neem oil. "

That's not to say clones are bad in any way, many of them perform close or as good as the originals, but the material wont be nearly as high of quality, and they wont be built as well (usually) as the real deal.

The way I see it is if you can afford a real one you should buy real because, yes, build quality and material make up the price difference, and many of the high end RBAs are worth the money they're asking, but if money is tight or you're not entirely positive on something a clone will get you nearly the same performance with all the looks for a fraction of the price.

darthbarracuda,Christianity,1388610662.0,"If you read my first post you would know that I am an atheist.

A book isn't a great way to spread your message. God chose a tribe of ancient, barbaric middle eastern people to write down his law. It's pretty much a formula for disaster and contradictions.

Annihilationism is a Christian minority view, not shared by the majority of Christians. Many denominations have different views of Hell. Yes, you could say that Annihilationism is similar to my view where when we die we cease to exist, we go into a metaphorical ""oblivion""; none-existence. We cannot be aware that we are unaware. But it is still viewed as punishment, as there is a ""better"" option out there; to believe in an invisible sky daddy for which there is absolutely no evidence for, and you get to go to heaven where you will eternally worship him. Or maybe eternally play trumpets. Or have sex. Or just kinda...exist. Heaven isn't described very well.

However, most Christian denominations believe in an eternal punishment, the Hell of torture and separation from god. It is used as a threat, to control the masses. Annihilationism is a little less dramatic, a little less harsh, but still has that same message; believe in god, accept Jesus into your heart, or not live forever. But if Annihilationism is in fact true, I won't know it. I will cease to exist. There won't be any punishment for me. That is no different from the reality of death, where you actually do cease to exist.

I won't care that I don't exist anymore. I won't be aware that I don't exist anymore. Nobody will be able to tell me, ""Ha, I was right, moron!"" I won't exist...*at all!* Annihilationism then, in my opinion, isn't really that scary. If I don't choose to worship god and Jesus, I cease to exist, big deal. I won't even know I don't exist or that I chose wrong. I won't know that I'm missing out on heaven.

Yeah, heaven sometimes seems like a cool place. But honestly it just seems like a fabricated piece of nonsense used to either control the masses or give comfort to people when they are faced with the harsh reality of the existence; that the universe doesn't care whether or not we are ""living"", and that when we all eventually die, we cease to exist, and the universe continues to move regardless. 

Once you realize this, your current life becomes much more important than just a massive test to see if you can live a second life."

MaybeAViking,MakeupAddiction,1388610702.0,"To be honest, my skincare routine is still a work in progress. Right now, things seem to be okay (albeit a little dry) using Clinique's Dramatically Different moisturizing gel and Epiduo nightly. I think my pore problem has to do with the fact that my face wash keeps changing. I live at home, and my family has the impression that what's good for the goose is good for the gander, so I use whatever is on sale, which means bad stuff for my sensitive skin. At the moment I'm loading my Clarisonic with Clean and Clear Essentials foaming facial cleanser, which I hate more than anything (how do fragrances and orange dye help get my face any cleaner?)

The best advice I can give for swelling (advice I sometimes don't take myself) is to be gentle with your face. No hot water, no harsh scrubbing, even though the first impulse is to purge purge purge, it always ends up doing more harm than good by irritating and inflaming the skin. There's no such thing as too gentle when it comes to sensitive skin, even when patting dry with a towel after you wash your face.

And I totally feel the mineral powder, I swear by it. Mainly because I'm afraid of liquid foundation. Have you been to /r/SkincareAddiction?"

Small bug report: when you are in frenzy/elder frenzy, the values for your frenzy/elder frenzy income under Miscellaneous Stats are calculated incorrectly.  It looks like they are 7x and 666x your *current* CPS instead of your *base* CPS.

Keep up the good work!

*edit* Another feature idea: show the total number of cookies that the current HC will cost, and/or other stats relevant to HC formula, so it's easier to calculate the number of cookies needed to get to a given HC total."

Hand independence is one of those critical skills. However, in my case, it's not so much hand independence so much as score dependence. Good arrangers lay out the notes spatially in the order you should play them. So you can use that in reading-oriented practice to know when you play both hands at the same time or one hand without the other.

This still means that may get the rhythm wrong but you still get the hands right. It's not hand-independence but (good) score-dependence and the over time the rhythm comes, especially if you do post-'30s pop music

It's mostly personal preferences.

1. I wouldn't get an SSD when I build the PC. Chances are, you have a set budget and are limited to that. Getting something unnecessary in the first build, such as an SSD, can get in the way of your budget. You can't get the better GPU because you've sneaked an SSD in.

2. I put the higher wattage PSU up there because you can upgrade later on, maybe with more HDDs or LED lights or whatnot. Maybe you can get another 770 in there for SLI. That's a sure fire way to not have to buy another PSU down the line.

3. With all the sacrifice of the SSD, you get a higher wattage PSU, better GPU and not only that, you get an aftermarket CPU cooler. There's a reason why many people use the 212 EVO y'know? Look, an aftermarket CPU cooler can get you better cooling for you CPU and quietness, if you're running at stock speeds, compared to the stock CPU cooler. Also, a cooler CPU helps in it's longevity.


You can get the SSD in a future upgrade, considering how fast were moving to flash storage, you *should* be able to have a great deal for SSDs in the coming year.

I was a child at the time.  Upon being asked I was trying to tell my Mom that, although I think she's an excellent cook, I just didn't particularly care for that entree.

My point was that the best chef in the world can go out into the back yard, select the finest dog droppings, gingerly place them in a baking dish, put it in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees F, put it on a plate, and garnish it with some celery.  The chef is fine, the recipe is fine, but it's still dog shit.

I'm the same way, actually. Doing random dungeons with DF, or getting a group via shout in Mor dhana..either way, it's made my anxiety of talking to people a lot better than it was prior to MMO's. Regardless of my social anxiety, I'm an introvert(was prior to the SA rearing it's ugly head) and being able to just craft or gather by myself and have alone time is really, really nice too and it allows me to recharge.

cfmonkey45,AskHistorians,1388611352.0,"Actually, January 1st was established as the New Year by the Roman Senate in 153 BC. The reason was actually for practicality. Before, the Civil and Consular year began on March 15, the Ides of March, as March was traditionally the first season in which Soldiers could muster for a fighting season. Once Spring began, there would be a few weeks for Roman citizens, who at the time were overwhelmingly farmers, to plant their crops, then head off to war, whilst their younger sons, wives, daughters, and slaves would maintain their properties.

This changed in 153 BC, where a military uprising in the Roman Province of Hispania (eastern Spain, near Catalonia), prompted a Roman response. However, when troops began to muster on March 15, they also had to board transports, sail across the Mediterranean, or March overland through the Alps, Southern Gaul, and the Pyrenees, and wouldn't arrive until July or August, which was towards the end of the fighting season.This problem was resolved by a decree of the Senate that moved the start of the Consular year from March 15 to January 1, which awkwardly placed it in the middle of Winter.

Thus, January 1st would largely be a political-religious holiday, with the two new consuls being sworn in, similar to inauguration day in the United States. Auguries would be taken, and public oaths of loyalty to the Republic would be sworn. The Roman calendar, which was based around ancient Roman agrarian practices, generally frowned upon harvesting or doing strenuous labor until the 13 of January. This time would largely be taken to to conduct personal auguries and rituals to attempt to divine individual fortunes in the New Year, so there were practical and religious considerations to be taken into account.

Additionally, there was a moveable feast, known as *compitalia*, that was dedicated to the Gods of the crossroads and the Goddess of the underworld. The festival apparently predates the founding of Rome and the Republic, and was instituted by one of the earlier Etruscan kings. The exact celebration would have ritual celebrations occurring at every crossroad in the city, with offerings given to the goddess of the underworld.

Each home would have small wool dolls of each member of the family hung around the doorway (similar to Passover), but with the expectation that the Gods of the Underworld would be contended with these as surrogates for those of the family. Additionally, heads of garlic would be offered, according to a tradition set down by Brutus after he overthrew the Roman King Tarquinius. According to legend, the oracles of Rome revealed that in order to spare each family, ""heads would be sacrificed for heads,"" implying the heads of children sacrificed for the family. However, Brutus exploited a loophole, because the head of garlic and poppies is the same as that of the actual anatomical part of the body. So as tradition, Romans made these offerings.

Additionally, there was the festival of *Sementivae*, which occurred later in the month, near January 24-25, and was devoted towards Ceres, the goddess of agriculture, with the hope that there would be a good growing season that year."

bigwoody,Seahawks,1388611366.0,"Wow, this is a really negative thread given that we're #7 in offensive DVOA despite a young team and lots of injuries this year.


Darrell Bevell is a master of the most under-appreciated part of coaching: creating mismatches. Look at the All-22 tape, and pay attention to the details. One good example is how he has developed wrinkles in our run game:

- Our base run play is the outside zone run with Marshawn Lynch. Since we are a run-first team, we want to call this all the time. If he coached the Redskins, he would want to run the outside zone with Alfred Morris, as he is also quite good at reading zone blocking.
- When the box is stacked, we turn the zone run into a zone read by having Russell Wilson read the backside DE or OLB. Simple stuff.
- Defenses answer this with all kinds of scrape exchanges and other front magic. Bevell addresses this with slice blocking to confuse the most common schemes, or reading other defenders. When he is on his game, it looks like he is 5 steps ahead of his opposition.

This is just one example. Consider that the Seahawks are #7 in offensive DVOA and yet are not a team of superstars (on offense). This is a well coached team, and Bevell would bring that to any offense, and if he can stand up to Dan Snyder, might be able to give RG3 his best chance to succeed.


There are downsides:

- Bevell is an unproven quantity in the head role. He can design an offensive game plan, but how is he with coaching up players as people? Can he bring a coherent defensive system or recruit a DC to mask his inexperience? Bevell feels to me as someone whose peak role is as a very skilled coordinator, a la Dick LeBeau.
- Yes, he isn't known for adjusting his playcalling significantly in-game. He has his plan and sticks to it, making only minor adjustments on the fly. Would this cause him problems in the head role? I don't know.


I personally hope we keep Bevell for a long time."

I think I didn't like how Mint had so many categories! I don't make a distinction in my budget between coffee shops and fast food, so that didn't work for me.

I am going to guess that you're just trying to provide another perspective, so people don't just jump and buy YNAB if it's not right for them, and that's cool. I just don't like the assumption that people who manually enter transactions are being duped by YNAB or something."

The setting and characters depicted in 300 are not the invention of the producers of that film. It is based historical events and people who cannot be copyrighted. Anybody can make a film around those characters in whatever way they want. The only thing that is copyrighted about 300 is the specific dialogue. So as long as they are not literally saying huge portions of the script of 300, there can't really be anything to sue over.

Similar with Hot Shots. There are aircraft carriers with jets on them in the real world. That's not something the producers of Top Gun made up. Aside from that general setting and a few situations in the movie, it's vastly different from Top Gun.

Sunfried,explainlikeimfive,1388612019.0,"Indoor ranges usually have a dirt berm at the target end of the room.  Every year or so, they close the range and ""mine"" the berm, which means they comb through it and remove all the chunks, and then replace the berm, pack it in, cover it with new dirt, and pack it in again.

Airborne lead is more of a hazard when shooting in unventilated room, because the heat of gunfire allows some of the lead to vaporize.  However, all the indoor ranges I've been to (which is very few) these days require FMJ, full metal jacket, ammo; a brass jacket around the entire bulled, which massively reduces the amount of lead exposed to the air near the shooter.

Earlier this year [eleven range employees sued their employer](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2020353191_gunrangeleadxml.html), a local gun range, based on their claims of exposure to lead. They claimed there were no protective measures taken.  Gun ranges are regulated as work environments, so this is more of an L&amp;I (State Dept. of Labor &amp; Industry) issue or, if it's a federal issue, OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) than EPA, at least as far as workers inside the indoor range.  [\(The range was fined over $23K by L&amp;I.](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2020985593_wadesgunshopxml.html) and the contractor who hired the workers to mine the berm [was also fined](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021001562_wadescontractorxml.html).)

[This article's over 20 years old](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/09/nyregion/a-suit-over-lead-at-a-firing-range.html), but it discusses some of the evironmental hazards at an outdoor range that you mention."

She was gorgeous: 5'8, bright red hair, blue eyes clear as the the summer sky and a sharp sense of humor. I was really into this girl and hitting it off great until she asked me to come over to her place really early in the night. I, of course, said yes, and we came back to her apartment. Wine was had, clothes started to come off. Everything was going great until I took off her panties and found that she had a ""landing strip"". When I watch(ed) porn, I *never* finished a movie if the girl had any hair down there. When it came to the eventual sex, I was just so fazed by this that I couldn't get it up. I was so embarrassed, blaming the whiskey I had drank earlier in the night. She seemed to not care and suggested that we just watch a movie together. I agreed, but the entire rest of the night, I couldn't shake that image of her body hair out of my head. At that point, I realized that porn had warped my image of women so badly, I couldn't deal with a potential hook-up/girlfriend having any imperfections, even if she was an amazing person and she really didn't even have a problem (a lot of women trim themselves like that, it's not really an issue.)

I left later that night. She gave me her number, but I was so mortified that I deleted her contact once I left the building (I completely regret that now.) So that's why I'm here. I've also been frequenting /r/pornfree for the few days between that encounter and yesterday."

My dream for this whole deal is if we get a defensive minded head coach, we get Shawn Watson (Louisville's OC and QB coach), sign G Jon Asomoah and one of the CBs, then go with Nix or Mosley, then either a NT or a MLB depending on who we pick. Then with the third rounder, take a guy who can catch passes out of the backfield like De'Anthony Thomas.

Then here's my big QB plan. We've got Cassel, who's shown himself to be at least a good game manager, then draft Logan Thomas wherever he is graded out. He's shown himself to have incredible pocket poise and arm strength. He shows problems with an internal clock and he has a tendency to force passes, but he's shown himself to be a very good QB when he has solid pieces around him (which having a line of Kalil, Fusco, Sullivan, Asomoah, and Loadholt should protect him and having supporting pieces of Jennings, Patterson, Wright, AP, and DAT should be more than enough to help Logan Thomas develop into a spectacular QB (although, not starting day one.)"

And it looks amazing. There's indeed nothing wrong with it at all. So I meant no disrespect, either.

I just don't understand why so many people were willing to accept that this was Ivy, when it barely looks like her, and there was no indication of it being Ivy other than OP's very misleading (and assuming) title.

That's still saying something though. A correlation IS saying something. It's saying that the odds of a relationship working out is less because of this factor. This is because we have found that the two are highly correlated. It doesn't matter if there is another trait that causes them both, because by having a higher number of partners, then you also have a higher chance of perhaps having that third factor that does mean there will be a divorce. 

Correlation is not causation, but that does not mean that correlations don't say something meaningful. "

Planet Net - Can create planet-sized nets to capture foes. Proportionately more helpful the bigger the foe. Funny enough, would probably lose to someone like Mario or almost any human, but would be able to subdue Galactus.

Scream Master - Can control screams. Surprisingly useful with a partner. Have someone scream and amplify the sound of it to supersonic levels while making the sound that bounces back to the innocents fairly soft in comparison. Probably works with sound-based superheroes on movie sets.

Second Woman - Someone who can manipulate anything related to ""2nds"", requires some thought but if she can make a conscious connection between what she's manipulating and ""2nds"" she can control it.

Ideally an alarm to message would be better.  If that wouldn't work, then maybe something like someone suggested where it sent out a different message daily, but the person had actually taken the time to write the messages while setting up the automation.

In any setup it would be best to let me know as I'm one to text back.  If every day at noon I get ""I love you"" and I reply ""I love you too.

So, of the people living in japan, 127,600 are not of Japanese, Chinese or Korean descent.

Statistically speaking, most of those people are probably going to come from where? Asia. Ergo, most of them are going to be Asian. many people come from America and Australia as well, but neither of those countries is a black-majority country to my knowledge, so in total this is like 5 levels of minority, assuming all immigrants to the country have children with the Japanese citizens there, which of course many won't.

Um_is_this_taken_yet,Catholicism,1388613016.0,"Look, man here is what it comes down to, you felt something at mass. God reached out and touched you with his infinite Love. You have two options, let Jesus into your boat or shove off the shore without him. He is The Way, The Truth, and The Life, no one said that being Catholic was easy. You have to make a simple answer yes or no. Go from there, no one is expecting you to be perfect right from the get go, at the same time though the truth is the truth, regardless of what us humans think. You can struggle with the truth, I do I'm sure we all have at one point. The thing is though the only thing stopping you from moving forward in your faith journey (this applies to everyone) is yourself. 

Calling yourself catholic will mean living your life for the glory of God. So, essentially you need to ask yourself if you're willing to rise to the occasion. All of the other doctrine stuff really comes second to the first question of ""Am I willing to live my life not for me but for He who put me here?"" Catholicism is still about loving and serving one another it's just many people don't truly live their faith.

I'm thinking that when you reach the end of this timeline, you start another timeline with some other brain being ""you"".  Rinse and repeat throughout spacetime.

In fact, the teammates that were closer to me were the ones that had also played with me on the B-team at some point.

And on a related note, after I finish arc welding or carpentry I've taken raw materials and turned them into a useful item or repaired something.

Example: For our anniversary, a guy buys me red long-stemmed roses, takes me out to an expensive restaurant and buys me a necklace from Kay Jewelers.  Sweet, well-intentioned, expensive and a lot of effort put in.  However, all I'd be thinking is, ""This isn't my scene at all, and he knows I don't like having lots of money blown on me.  Why didn't we just go to that brewpub we like?""  If sex happens that night, part of me will feel obligated no matter how much I want it.

Example 2: We text each other at work, and he knows I've had a shit day, so he orders that junkfood I don't usually let myself have, and Redboxes that movie I've been wanting to see.  We cuddle until I feel better and then get naked.  There's sincerity in the gesture, as well as a knowledge of my preferences and a desire to make me feel better.  Perfect."

afropunk3,blackladies,1388613978.0,"I read the entry from ""diaryofanegress"" (a tongue in cheek name, I suppose?), and I also skimmed the arguments made by your post.
All people, not just whites, will seek to hide from uncomfortable truths or deny their responsibility when they are accused of participation in wrongdoing. In the case of race relations, it seems rather obvious that most whites are passively participating in wrongdoing by accepting (without question) the benefits that they receive from their privileged status. Thus, it isn't surprising that most whites do not like to receive any reminders that they are achieving success in their lives through the oppression/subjugation of other groups.

However, I still take issue with a few of your concepts. The overall tone of your post is conspiratorial in nature, and the ideas that you express could never lead to any form of peace or reconciliation. You deliberately ignore the difference between ""active"" and ""passive"" participation in oppression (obviously, all whites are not consciously involved in a strident effort to suppress/marginalize members of racial minorities), and you don't seem to have a lot of interest in bringing others to any sort of common ground. I think that this is a real shame; much work needs to be achieved in bridging gaps between the mainstream social justice community and our race. Being pro-black doesn't have to require divorcing all contact with the other major racial groups in this nation."

TheLittleGoodWolf,childfree,1388614326.0,"&gt;Actually, it kind of sounds as though you are one of those people who thinks species from the past are somehow inferior or ""less evolved"". It really doesn't work like that - the reason life now is very different to life a 100 million years ago is simply because the earth is a very different place, and what worked well then no longer works well now.

Nope not really. I think that extinct species from the past are less adapted to survive in the world we live in today though. Some of them at least, and even dinosaurs would probably be hunted to near extinction because of the danger that they would pose should they be alive today. Just speculation though. I also believe that nature is immensely adaptive in the long term, and when some species go extinct they are replaced by others.

&gt;Fuck. Do you have any emotions at all?

Yes, yes I do! I just have the ability to disregard them in a discussion where they have no real place. My look was purely at societal and economic function of different types of people and what would happen should they be swiftly removed. I know the difference between hypothetical thinking and definite actions. That does not make me devoid of emotions in the least.

&gt;We don't generally eat each other

While this is true, different societal groups (grouped by function not by attributes) do survive off of the loss of others. A company will sacrifice some of its workers to ensure it's own survival when needed. The entire medical profession is dependent upon the disease and weakness of the population.

&gt;we don't have different species

Sure we do, all the different roles that exist in society could easily be compared to different species in an ecosystem. One persons trash is another persons treasure.

&gt;and the kind of evolution that goes on is very different.

This is true, it happens much quicker in society, but the societal roles (species) evolve as society evolves with them.

Perhaps I should have clarified I meant a metaphorical ecosystem not an actual one. I apologize for that. But I do see plenty of similarities with an ecosystem and a society. But as sated in the end it is mostly just me letting my thoughts roam."

datanimal,todayilearned,1388614385.0,"Well, it's an impossible question because the only way to find out would be to completely remove all religions from society to see how people are affected.

But, the other day when the pope said that trickle down economics doesn't work I was on board with that because he and the religion he wields seemed to be trying to inspire people to be more charitable.  I was on board for the inspiration, but I also believe free market economics is a big player in a system that has caused [this](http://www.aei-ideas.org/2013/12/chart-of-the-greatest-and-most-remarkable-achievement-in-human-history-and-one-you-probably-never-heard-about/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FmmMP+%28CARPE+DIEM%29).  It's ok with me if his opinion on economics wasn't well-reasoned because we need people inspiring us toward charity regardless of their use of data.

I tend to think reddit and much of modern, western thought is obsessed with being right and showing the truth behind something.  It's a wonderful thing because it helps us nail down all kinds of problems, but there's a relational and spiritual aspect to people that religion, when done right, synthesizes into compassion and empathy.  

The ""when done right"" is as critical to religious endeavors as it would be to scientific progress if scientific progress was in question.  I dislike bad religion as much as I dislike bad science.

Not enough redditors have seen religion done well so I suppose I understand the autodownvotes at my implication that religions are beneficial to society."

So when we catch up with them one on one it is usually either lunch or coffee, only. But maybe her relationship isn't like that, and maybe they are serious but not exclusive.

That said, if she knows how you feel, regardless if whether she is in a relationship or not, I don't think it is cool for her to think it is ok to hang out without at least talking to you about it.  Sometimes people are not in the headspace where real friendship is possible because one still has the feels.

Also it depends on the kind of compliment. ""Nice shirt"", ""Great job"", ""you are a genius"", ... that's normal and ok. Say ""wow, you are cute"" and will start planning our marriage. "

Disclaimer: my hair is really long, so only a small percentage is near the hair.

My default ""I want my hair out of the way"" style is to gather it at the nape of the neck, fold it in half so the ends are just above the nape of the neck, put the folded-in-half ponytail up against my head, and clip it there with [this kind of clip](http://www.alerg.com/media/catalog/product/cache/7/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/g/o/goody-claw-clip-updo-pack.jpg).

I'm sure a similar issue would occur for most saltwater fish, not just sharks.

I'm sure the opposite would happen for fresh water fish. They get too much salt since their bodies are used to a lower salt environment."

Unlimited possibilities for character creation (species, apparel, cosmetics, voice, personality traits, etc...). 

Create a family of Dragonborns. You and your family parade around Tamriel, questing for the ultimate demise of Master Hand. Up to five families can quest at once. Friends or AI optional. Online capabilities is a given.

You begin at your mom's house, where your family is relaxing on a Monday morning. Alternate beginnings can be discovered, made possible by the integration of complex character and family compositions. (i.e. your son is on the DDR machine while your wife cooks up fresh mudcrabs for breakfast).

You receive a phone call from Peach, who informs your family of the sudden disappearance of Mario and his Smash Bros. (For the sake of the game, lets say Mario, Captain Falcon, Fox, and DK). Your family immediately sets off to remedy this horrendous problem.

From town to town, you raise the disposition of the townsfolk by repeatedly telling them jokes and asking them to ""pull your finger"", until they release  information containing the whereabouts of the Mario and his Bros. Each town has its own respective Star Hall, where you compete in intense dance competitions and receive Stars or coins depending on the outcome.

Master Hand, of course, is aware of the Dragonborns, and sends a series of malicious DDR arrows to diminish the heroes.

If you feel like you should have a vagina or breasts or that you are too hairy, etc. that is called gender dysphoria. You feel like the current state of your body doesn't quite match up with what should be there, right? I'd say that's a pretty big sign you're trans. Of course, you should probably talk to a queer-friendly counselor about this - they can help you better understand those feelings and you can discuss the possibility of transitioning with them.

As far as having a lot in common with gay men, I don't see anything particularly wrong with that. Personally, I'm female but I usually relate a lot more easily to guys because I'm fairly masculine. That doesn't invalidate my womanhood or identity. You're allowed to like what you like - no two women are the same, and there is no one ""right"" way to be female.

hennypen,changemyview,1388615124.0,"&gt; The exceptions of course are in cases of rape, if the mother's life is at risk or if the child will have significant birth defects that would be an excessive burden on the mother, the child, the state, or any other third parties.

If you believe that abortion is wrong, why would rape be an exception?  If you think there should be a rape exception, you don't believe that abortion is wrong: you believe that people only deserve one chance to opt out of having a child.  You believe that consenting to having sex equals consenting to have a child.

&gt;
My reasoning is this: Whenever a man and a woman enter into consensual sex, they are aware of the consequences of not using adequate protection (The pill + Condom together for total safety). They are accepting the terms and conditions with mother nature so to speak, and if a child were to be conceived as a result then both parties should be bound by law to see that this human being is brought into the world safe and sound and is given 'their shot' at life, this may entail adoption but at least this person's life is now in their own hands.

Yup.  Here's the thing: Mother Nature isn't bound by the terms, either.  There are several problems with this.  First, hormonal birth control has more potential complications than you realize.  A great many people cannot take it for a variety of reasons.  Should those people get an abortion exception?  Should they be required to abstain from sex completely?

Second, we change the rules of nature all the time.  We preserve our health in ways not intended by nature, we change our environment in ways not intended by nature, and we are often better for it.  The ability to control childbirth is a miracle.  It's one that people have sought after throughout human history with varying degrees of success.  Throughout history, people have used various substances as birth control/abortificants, stuff ranging from crocodile dung (up the vag) to animal intestines (over the dick).  When fertility is controlled, women are healthier, the overall standard of living is better, and the children that women do have get better care and education.  Most women who have abortions in the US already have kids.  They already understand what it is to give birth to and care for a child, and they often say that they're having an abortion to be able to take better care of the children that they already have.  To force them to go through with pregnancies when they acknowledge that they cannot care for more children is impractical.  To either outright or by implication force anyone to give up a child for adoption is completely, utterly wrong.  Allowing women to prevent a child from fully developing and being born is the most humane option we have in this situation.

Third, nature's a fucking bitch.  Something like 25% of all pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion (miscarriage).  I had a miscarriage.  It was fucking awful, it hurt, and I was sad for a long time.  I'm still sad about it.  I can't imagine choosing that.  I can't imagine what women who have abortions go through, and I can't imagine that they choose that lightly.  We've all heard stories about people using abortion as birth control, and there's always a range of people who abuse their rights.  It's still an important right to protect for the rest of us.

&gt;
Now i understand there is an argument that a foetus isn't considered to be human until the later stages of development, however this is also rife with subjectivity and from what I've read (feel free to prove me otherwise) the jury is still out on whether a foetus going through an abortion feels pain or not. Additionally, whether or not we agree or disagree on the stages at which a foetus becomes a human, one thing that we can be sure of (with the exception of unusual circumstances), is that a foetus will at some point become a healthy, individual human being. Is denying another human being's right to life prior to their development any different to killing them later on?

Um, yes.  I've had a miscarriage.  I've had a baby.  Losing my baby would not be the same as a miscarriage.  It's not at all the same.  

&gt;
I also sympathise with the ""It's my body I'll do what i want with it"" argument, but as a modern society we generally try to afford individuals as many freedoms as possible provided they aren't infringing upon the rights of another human (current or future). For example, most countries don't force you to wear a helmet when riding a bicycle, because with the exception of very minor additional healthcare costs (those without helmets = more likely to be hospitalised) you aren't harming anyone but yourself by not wearing a helmet. 

Helmets are the law where I live.  This is beside the point.

&gt;On the other hand, we enforce seatbelt laws because in the case of a car accident, those without seat belts are more likely to move around and knock heads with other passengers, passengers who may be wearing seat belts, so another party is being put in danger.
I think we forget that this argument doesn't adequately recognise that your needs for personal freedom do in fact infringe upon the physical safety of another, we forget this because the other party currently lacks a voice to defend themselves. 

You're missing the main point here.  We don't force anyone to preserve the life of another.  Denying women the right to have an abortion doesn't protect them from infringing on the fetus' rights.  It prevents the fetus from infringing on their rights.  There's a reason that in the US viability is a big issue.  Past viability, abortion should be regulated.  Prior to viability, it shouldn't, because prior to viability the fetus (whatever pain it may or may not feel) is not an independent life form, and it requires the body of the mother to survive.  We don't force people to donate organs to preserve the lives of others.  We shouldn't force women to temporarily donate their bodies to preserve the lives of unwanted babies.

&gt;This is where i think we start to go from a matter of life or death to a matter of convenience, are the next 9 months of your life worth more than the entire lifespan of another person? I don't think this is a matter of individual morality, or a matter of convenience. This is a matter of life or death.

I disagree.  It's a matter of life or not life, and it's a matter of basic human dignity.  If women do not have the right to control their fertility and to control their own bodies, they lack the basic human right of self determination.  Outlawing abortion says that we as a society says that women, actual people, are worth less than potential people.  When you say you're against abortion you're telling me that I'm worth less than a clump of cells that is arguably a person. 

&gt;
I used to be pro-choice a couple of years ago, mostly because it was socially acceptable and i hadn't put much thought into it. I am quite socially progressive in almost every other way, but i can't seem to reconcile this issue.

Abortion is worth talking about, and worth having a thought out view on.  I think that abortion is an unfortunate fact of life.  I hope that I will never be desperate enough to decide to have one.  But banning abortion doesn't prevent abortion.  It prevents safe abortion.  It prevents women from accessing health care.  It allows systems that prey on women to arise, and it allows people to abuse and mistreat women who are desperate enough to seek illegal abortions.  It favors the rich and makes the unfortunate even more unfortunate.

I will tell you that when I've discussed this with pro-life people, every single time they've ended up by attacking my person sexual mores (which are actually pretty conservative).  Based on personal experience, I do believe that a lot of pro-life sentiment comes from a desire to punish sexuality.  I have some respect for anyone who worries about the morality of abortion, but I lose it pretty fast when I get called a whore.  On the pro-choice side, I see a lot more being done to actually prevent abortion and to educate women.  On the pro-life side, I see a lot being done to spread misinformation and attack people.  This is my experience in the US, and your spelling leads me to believe that you're not in the US, but it's what I've got.

In the US, we waste so much time and money fighting over abortion.  I would love to see what we could do if we worked to really improve both birth control and sex ed as well as support for early childhood.  Right now the US lags behind the rest of the first world in supporting people who have children.  Our early childhood education systems and parental leave policies should be better.  No one should ever have to feel that abortion is her only financial option.  But outlawing abortion only serves to victimize and blame women for being sexual beings."

TotallyNotSuperman,whowouldwin,1388615361.0,"&gt; If you want him to win, there is an explanation for how he does it that, however convoluted, is in some way supported by the comics.

Then when I challenge them, they should be able to support it. For many, if not most, of the claims, people either do not or cannot. They just tell me ""He's Batman; that's just how the writers made him."" But if there's no in-comic reference to point to, then there's no reason to think that the writers did anything of the sort.

Batman has had plans for the JLA. He's had plans for various things. But whenever Darkseid shows up, where's his plan? Radion, you might say. I'd counter with the fact that before Final Crisis, he never knew such a thing existed.

Despite numerous interactions over several years, Batman had nothing special to use against Darkseid, one of the most dangerous foes faced by the JLA. Batman *never* had a plan to beat him until the last few days. He once managed to get him to surrender Supergirl, but that wasn't something he set up ahead of time, nor does it help in a fight to incap/death. He was *never* able to harm Darkseid until the radion bullet came along, but I'm supposed to believe that he always had a plan for everyone? That's not just asking me to believe things without evidence; that's asking me to believe them despite evidence to the contrary.

So forgive me, but I will continue asking for actual in-comic proof of Batman's abilities. If the writers gave him the abilities, it should be easy for people to prove it."

Something that might work at a state level does not necesarilly translate to Federal level.

ACA was designed as a feint, to ""prove"" conservative ideas wouldn't work. When in reality the only conservative idea used was the mandate, and that was never going to work at the national level.

The point of the ACA was to erode confidence in the insurance model, and slowly force providers out of the market, as well as forcing people onto the government approved plans.

Conservatives have been saying since 2008, that ACA would break the system and then progressives would say ""now we have to do something to fix it!"" and move to single-payer.

I must say I find the idea of comparing Thorin to Aragorn *as characters* to be completely dumb - not that this stops people from doing so, but they have very little in common. It's interesting that viewers will complain about shows being simple and intellectually un-stimulating, yet at the same time they are often unwilling to make actual mental effort. Yes, Thorin and Aragorn are both  heirs to the throne, and both are badass warriors that help a hobbit along but ultimately end up needing a hobbit's help themselves. That's about it, for similarities, and then there's a world of difference.

But in the case of my friend I happen to know he made a purely visual comparison, and chose Aragorn because his wife found him to be the most attractive in the LotR films. So he had this ""model of Middle Earth beauty"" in the form of Aragorn, and now he gets a dwarf that is far more beautiful than what he thought was the paragon. So he's confused. I don't blame him, I'll wager many a fan who got used to his idea of dwarves as small scott-ish drunkards was confused by Prince Smokinshield and the sexy line of Durin. (Though Thrain and Thror weren't such lookers, so I guess Thorin's mother must have been the dwarven Venus.)

(My own Mum looks with some amusement and not much understanding at her daughter who seems intent on a teenage-encore in her thirties. If pressed, she will admit Richard ""has something."" My brother is extremely uncomfortable with his ""little"" sister being unashamed of her obsession.)

It's interesting how hung up on his looks everyone is. I mean the looks as Thorin: I have to *remind* them that acting is more than looking. I need to ask, ""did you see this, did you pay attention to that,"" drag his voice, his line delivery into the conversation ; otherwise they would just prattle on about him being pretty. I wonder if it's some masculine insecurity talking :D

Thorin has amazing presence. He keeps himself apart, but others never forget he's there. When Balin negotiates with Bard (wonderful scene, by the way) he glances for his king's approval. When they are at Beorn's, he sits slightly to the side, arms folded, in a way that would have seemed sulky and stuck up in anyone else ; but Richard makes it work, makes it fit. When they argue whether or not to get into the barrels, he lets them complain for a moment, but when he says, ""do it"" they fall silent and do it, and it seems natural. Of course they listen to him, the script makes them listen to him - but he makes it believable.

(Whew! Wall of text! :D)"

Corbenik,whowouldwin,1388615515.0,"There's no real evidence to say the the LDB is immortal, and typically we assume that things are mortal unless otherwise stated by the lore.

&gt; I did say basically a demigod. Not in the literal sense.

You'll have to understand our confusion. Because of the sheer number of characters that we deal with, ""basically a demigod"" implies demigod of that universe, with some complications surrounding the situation. For example, Disney's Hercules is ""basically a demigod"" despite being a god because of the circumstances revolving around his birth."

Therefore, for every 1,000 rounds of 9mm ammo expended, the range can sell it for about $6.60. Now start multiplying that by day, week, month and year. Add in other kinds of ammunition. Also include all the brass ($1.25-ish/lb).

flyingcatpotato,AskWomen,1388615879.0,"I have had a UTI for a month for which i just got out of the hospital and for which i am seeing a specialist next week. All the advice in this thread is good for a casual UTI but for me, cranberry supplements actually made me worse and was just told to stop them.  The reasoning is that my urethra is already irritated and the cranberry was irritating it more.  So if she has been dealing with stuff for over a month, it might not be right to start cranberry if she hasn't already.

Some people get UTIs from ""rarer"" bacteria and the normal Cipro or Bactrin regimen does not work. In my case, i self treated for two weeks, then went through six antibiotics before being hospitalized on IV meds.  

Not having hair down there seems to make things worse for me, i am less likely to get an active flare if i have a little bit of hair down there, i don't know why- i think it has to do with the fact that my urethra is irritated and the hair protects it a bit. Of course this can go both ways, i think a full bush can harbor pee and other stuff too.  Like the cranberry, your gf needs to see which option works.

Sex has been ok for me but fingering has been painful due to the proximity of clit and urethra so that is one thing. If you do go down there, make sure everyone has short, clean nails which are not too sharp (freshly cut). 

I have stayed away from coffee and tea lately- while it does make me pee more, some of the stuff in it can be irritating to the bladder in a long term situation. Chamomile tea has worked for me the best when i wanted a hot beverage."

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1388615898.0,"I can definitely see both ways about 2008. Per-game numbers it was fairly even (28-6-5 vs 20-11-7). Efficiency wise they were identical (57.6%) though that's probably an advantage to Kobe given he had more pressure as a scorer and still scored at the same efficiency.

CP3 also had better advanced numbers (28 to 24 PER, 0.28 to 0.21 WS/48, 18 to 14 overall WS).

As for the team comparison, that's a fair enough. I wouldn't underrate David West so much (though Pau was definitely better, he was only on the Lakers for half the season. Don't think Bynum was much better than West). 

In any case, because advanced stats weren't a thing and the team records were so close, I can see the argument for Kobe to get his lifetime achievement MVP award (CP3 wasn't undoubtedly the best player, anyways). You're certainly free to think CP3 was robbed.

Re: 2006-2007, Bill Simmons (!) wrote a good piece that explained why Kobe should have gotten it in 2006. The argument is that he was the best player in the league, and he had the most *value* to his team. Like the Lakers won 45 in 2006 but realistically without him they'd be a 10-12 win team (check out the names on the roster). 2007 probably still should have gone to Dirk since Kobe &amp; Dirk played equally well, but Dirk had a better team (and record). 

But personally I tend to undervalue how much the team counts, because it doesn't necessarily reflect how valuable you are to your team. For example, the only player in the last decade I can think of more valuable to his team than Kobe in 2006 was LeBron in 2009 (probably a 30 win team without him, a 65 win team with him), and unsurprisingly you could argue that those were also two of the best seasons by probably the two best players since at least Duncan's prime ~2003. Of course most MVP voters don't see it that way and instead do a combination of how well your team played and how good your stats were, which is why I don't think 2006 was necessarily a snub for Kobe. I just take MVP titles with a grain of salt instead."

mintyJulips,AskWomen,1388616347.0,"I think with younger girls, it's a case of not feeling comfortable asking for what they want during sex or not knowing their bodies well enough to know what gets them off with a partner. And because young guys can be selfish or impatient lovers, and younger girls have a higher tolerance for that sort of thing.

Yeah, that 5% figure is because of the embargo in the first place.  America is a gigantic market that's within *sailboat range* of Cuba.  
 
I don't buy the idea that Cuba would be ""on par with Scandinavia"" or whatever, but let's not pretend that the embargo hasn't caused massive human and economic suffering in Cuba over the last several decades.  After all, the entire point of a trade embargo is to inflict economic pain on people and to coerce their behavior (in this case, the behavior of wanting to set up a socialist economy within America's sphere of influence).

&gt;That Professor Goddard, with his ‘chair’ in Clark College and the countenancing of the Smithsonian Institution, does not know the relation of action to reaction, and of the need to have something better than a vacuum against which to react — to say that would be absurd. Of course he only seems to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high schools.


In 1969, days before Apollo 11 landed on the moon, it published this correction:


&gt;Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th century, and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere.

So I came up with the genius idea to make pasta in the microwave.  I put the pasta and a bunch of water in a big plastic tupperware container and let it go. After a few minutes I went to pull it out to check it but I didn't realize that the starchy water had boiled over all over the container and the microwave. I went to grab the container but it was wet and slipped out of my hands, dumping the hot water all over my torso.

 I yelled for my sister but she couldn't hear me. 

I cleaned up all the water and pasta all over the floor before I realized that I should probably dry the hot water off my stomach.

 I ended up with pretty large burns over my stomach, hips, and upper thighs but never told anyone about it because I thought they wouldn't let me cook alone anymore. Most of the scars have faded but I still have some small areas of discoloration on my hips."

As far as split pushing goes, your team has to commit to it. While you're splitting your team obviously shouldn't fight a 4v5.

I know for a fact plenty of churches have active roles in local communities and offer charitable services and engage in charitable deeds. For a church to avail of tax benefits they should have to prove to the government that they actually do something, this would encourage churches to be charitable if they aren't already. 


If a church does something and actually contributes to the local community then they deserve to be able to claim tax back, allowing them to do so is only benefiting the community. If they don't meet the criteria then they simply don't get the tax break, its simple.

Honestly, if a church isn't actively helping people in the community then they aren't much of a church in the first place and they don't deserve a tax break. Helping and loving others is a major theme in the bible."

ArcFurnace,pokemontrades,1388617010.0,"Actually, from what I recall, completing one of the Super Training scenarios seems to mostly give you small/medium/large training bags in the stat the scenario is improving.  Punching the bag on the main Super Training screen seems to give you the ""special"" bags more often, but getting the precise bag you want does take a bit.  One tip is to punch that bag when your Pokemon is ""energized and ready to go"", with the little smiley face bubble (if they're asleep, tapping them to wake them up will put them into this state, or punching a Team Flare bag for a while will do so as well).  This seems to greatly increase the probability of getting rewarded a bag, which will help you get the one you want faster."

My snake got injured (she had to stay at a place I didn't live for a while so I wasn't there) and I had to drop $380 at a moment's notice. She got 6 stitches and has made a full recovery but if I didn't have access to that money immediately I can't say with any certainty she would be alive today.

sBcNikita,ShingekiNoKyojin,1388617062.0,"Jean, because he's come such a long way as a character. He went from being the jerk training to join the MP, to a grim, brave soldier deeply invested in humanity's cause.

Armin, because he's developed greatly too. He's the underdog, the dreamer, and he's come into his own as a detective, strategist, and soldier. He's half of the idealistic inspiration behind Eren's rage, but at the same time he's become aware of the fact that, to attain victory, a certain degree of one's humanity must be sacrificed. I think he deserves a shot at life postwar.

Levi. I'm predicting another major development for his character soon, but even as he is now, he's far more complex than people give him credit for being. He's not just a titan slayer. He's been fighting the war and shouldering others' hopes for a long time, and the fact that he's still able to serve is a testament to his strength.  He tries to be a mentor to the trainees, all while remaining somewhat aloof and professional (and we all know how dangerous it is to be a mentor in a fictional narrative). He deserves to live to see peace in my book.


and Annie. Yes, Annie. Hear me out for a second. [Anime Spoilers](/m ""All things considered, she's probably already done for--nobody even knows if she's alive inside the crystal, and even if she emerged or if the Survey Corps found a way to shatter it, I find it difficult to imagine anything other than her eventual execution for her crimes. The thing is, though, the poor girl's had an absolutely awful life... she was raised as practically a child soldier, it's implied that her father  forced her into her role against her will and his own conscience, she's spent almost her entire life alone, she failed at almost everything she ever attempted, she got captured because she was kind enough to teach Eren martial arts and human enough to let Armin live, and we can count the number of times she's ever been happy on a couple fingers.

You don't have to watch a single episode of Fresh Prince to understand the characters and what they're going through. Hell, you don't even have to watch the preceding fifteen minutes of this particular episode. Television dramas are usually hammy as it is, and besides require an understanding of the characters involved that comes from watching then develop for *x* seasons.

Lou scrapes by in life and is always chasing what he thinks will make it better. Phil knows this; Lou's his brother-in-law, after all. ""Will isn't a coat you can put in your closet that you wear when you feel like it."" Lou thinks he can prostrate himself and garner pity, it's probably worked before. Phil doesn't have any of that. Lou still tries to avoid the situation by saying he'll call Will on the road, we can hear in his voice it's another empty promise. ""Hey, daddy-o!"" Will has forgiven his father's absence. Lou cringes, he can't avoid it this time. With a crack in his voice, he tells his only son it's only temporary but even he doesn't believe himself. Will doesn't, either. He's already written his dad back out of his life, barely containing his emotions, trying to remain a man himself. ""You too, *Lou*."" Phil is devastated for his nephew, and listens to and supports him as he rants how he is more of a man than his father will ever be. When Will finally breaks down, Phil embraces him. Phil is Will's uncle; but he's the best father Will could ever wish for.

It is incredibly powerful. In my opinion, the most powerful scene I've seen on television. Which one do you think trumps it? We're just sharing opinions here, there's no right or wrong."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388617398.0,"Do you really see that as workable? Last time I looked the average voter isn't that smart. Not that we could agree in the first place. I think we need professional politicians to an extent, we just need them receptive to ALL people, not only to the special interests with the money to get their attention.

Anyway, as for what makes them enlightened, lemme put it this way. I have a degree in political science, I also went on to get a masters in community leadership. I actually worked with a council in my city in helping make a steep slope ordinance as part of my capstone for my master's degree. Writing GOOD laws is HARD. It requires a crapton of research and knowledge of the potential consequences. You basically need to immerse yourself in making these laws, giving such a task your full attention.

Direct democracy puts power directly in the hands of the people who think Obama is a socialist atheist muslim who wasn't born here and wants to turn us communist. Do you REALLY propose giving these people that kind of power?

Heck, speaking of the kind of law I worked on with my project, wanna know what I just recently got from some libertarian? Articles about how people can't garden in their own back yards due to zoning laws. Now, these articles and the point he was trying to make completely ignored the reason those laws were apparently in place, which was to make people have their yards covered with vegetation, as to reduce erosion and runoff. 

This isn't what a lot of people thinking about. They just notice that they can't garden, make some populist libertarian argument about how they should be able to do what they want with their property, and under direct democracy, we would likely see such a law repealed. Even though it would lead to increased soil erosion and runoff. Even though a lot of stuff would end up in our streams we don't want there. Even though the fruits could attract wild animals we don't want. The average person just isn't well informed enough to actually take the reins of the actual legislative process. While politicians should hear what they have to say and work toward their interests when possible, you just can't expect them to actually make the legislation themselves. They don't know what they're doing most of the time, and end up tinkering with that which they don't understand.

We need full time politicians, ie, experts, to make law for us. These experts should be receptive to the will of the people, but they should also use their better judgment in some cases to make decisions that sometimes go against the will of the people if the consequences will be disastrous. Do we really want the ""Archie Bunkers"" of the world running things? (if you don't know who Archie Bunker is watch a few episodes of ""All in the Family"" on youtube). Think about it. Think about it long and hard."

&gt; Look at Israel in the Old Testament. God clearly favored Israel over Egypt and the the rest of the ancient world. 

I would argue that is not true for a few reasons. Israel is the result of the covenant God made with Abraham, so they were not loved more, but simply had a different position.

These kinds of guys get off on threatening those they perceive to be weaker than them because they have power issues.  When I was younger and less fit, I would have the occasional experience with some dipshits like this guy you ran into, and they would try to play up their perceived strength over me.  Now that I'm a bit older, and a bit bigger, very few of these people will even try it with me. To be honest, in my experience in dealing with losers like this guy, they're not fond of following through with their actions. They huff and puff, but never manage to blow anything or anyone down, because all they have is their loud voices and meaningless lives. 

In other words: you were a convenient target for his sad, meaningless life.  I'm really sorry that you had to experience this on what is usually a great day.  Fuck him.

Skyler827,Bitcoin,1388617690.0,"No one knows the answer to this.  Furthermore, no amount of historical knowledge enables us to predict the future.  The following is my personal **conjecture**, based on my intuition of the technology involved, scale of the bitcoin economy, and experience in seeing public posts about hacks/other problems:

* Most secure option: cold storage (ie a computer that has never touched the internet: **No one** has ever lost bitcoins to malicious hackers this way)  It is impossible to estimate how many lost bitcoins due to data loss.  Risk factors: not backing up your wallet, attempting to use a disconnected computer on the internet, manually modifying bitcoin software

* 2nd best: paper wallet/flash drive (very safe, if your computer wasn't compromised when you generated them)  Roughly ~**1 in 100,000** have lost bitcoins by *malicious hacking*, and perhaps **1 in 1,000** by *accidentally spending them incorrectly* upon withdrawing them.  Risk factors: generating bitcoins on an insecure computer (hacking) or using different software for creating/withdrawing bitcoins from a paper wallet/flash drive (accidentally spending them incorrectly)

* 3rd best: Desktop client (keep your computer secure!! but generally safe.)  Roughly **1 in 5,000** have lost by malicious hacking.  Risk factors: running untrustworthy software, not having an antivirus program/UAC, not encrypting your wallet.  (I do not consider blockchain.info to be in the same security class as a desktop application\*)

* 4th best: smartphone app/Blockchain.info\* (If you do this, be VERY careful about your other apps.  Thefts can happen anytime bugs are found in iOS or Android, and a malicious app is running)  Roughly **1 in 500** have lost by malicious hacking.  Risk factors: Running questionable apps on your phone, not encrypting your wallet, publication of a mobile security exploit.

* WORST Security: On someone else’s' website (Get the out as soon as possible)  Roughly **1 in** ~~200~~ **400** have lost by malicious hacking, or theft by the website operators.  Risk factors: leaving coins there for a long period of time, the website is fronting a business that isn't making a fair profit.

iheartaegislash,explainlikeimfive,1388617697.0,"There is a ""cure"" called accutane (medical name isotretinoin,) but that stuff sucks. Well not really. It works, but it messes you up A LOT. They ""suggest"" (pretty much a requirement) that you drink about a gallon of water and a gallon of liquid with an electrolyte (like Gatorade.) If I understood what my doctor said properly it literally kills cells in the skin that produce oil. No oil means less (in a lot of cases no) acne. The problem is it also kills a lot of other cells, and those cells that produce oil I believe also store water (hence the huge liquid intake requirements) leading to pretty adverse side effects. I was on it for about 18-20 months, and it was miserable, but it all but cleared up my acne. It has come back a little bit (I got off of it about 6 years ago) but only spotty and not covering all of my skin like it was when I started the treatment.

As far as proactiv (a treatment here in the states) it is hit or miss. It depends on what causes your acne, and was designed for middle-aged women who had adult acne. Most young people that have severe acne have something called cystic acne which proactiv doesn't do much to help.

If your question is why we haven't eradicated it entirely, the underlying cause of acne is a virus (actually a different strand of what causes genital herpes, but this virus is found in most people where the genital strand isn't) and we have no known cure for viruses.

The events of the two books are separated by 1000 years, though most of that time is skipped between the first and second books.

puaSenator,AskMen,1388617754.0,"&gt; Nice girls say they want nice guys, because they do. Meanwhile, sorority girls bang frat guys, and you interpret that as female cognitive dissonance.

For the most part it is true. We can NAWALT all day, but the truth is, most of the hot 8, 9, and 10s that we want are those type of girls. Maybe not as hard as the sorority hoes, but it's still generally true. Most of the girls honestly looking for the ""nice guys"" aren't really that special. They aren't that hot and don't have much to offer. 

I hate admitting there is a certain caliber of people in society that we all live in, but it's true. When I look around, most of the type of women I deem quality tend to go for those types of guys you don't like. We, as a group of men, try to push ourselves forward to get those type of women. It's a self help sub after all. If we wanted to just settle for mediocre, we'd go to /r/relationships. But no, most people in TRP want better so we push for that lifestyle. And you know what, it works. It works very fucking well. I've had my fair share of hot sluts, insecure women, confident business women, and wonderful potential unicorns. I've seen it all. And in that vast experience, I can tell you that it holds generally true that it's true. I want to be proven wrong. I would love for a women to love men the way we love them back, but it's just not true. I don't care if it's cultural or biological, the truth is, we are different and each sex is using a different strategy. I'm not here to push a social movement either, rather I look at how the world is and am focused on taking advantage of the current situation as much as I can to further my progress. 

You also talk about not wanting to share a planet with us. I think you're over thinking it. Yeah, there is a good handful of neckbeards with us, which I wouldn't like to share the world with either. But at the end of the day, they are just working on self improvement. And with time they will be able to shave the beard. The truth is, on a very real honest level, you'd probably like me. In fact, you'd probably like most of us around there that aren't in the early stages. You need to really understand there is a disconnect among what we say and do. No one is advocating to call women bitches to their faces, even though it sometimes comes off as that. You're just reading it at face value and failing to see the underlying communication. Me, and other TRP guys as well, you'll say you hate us on the surface based on our TRP dicussions. But I promise you, IRL, you'd like us. I know it. Most people I am around enjoy being around me. 

Also you need to further understand that most of what you read on the sub comes from early pill takers. They are understandably bitter. They've been mislead. They've spent their formative years trying to develop a skillset that is ass backwards and wrong, when they could have been working on developing useful social skills. 

Not only that, but the typical life cycle of a member is a good three months. Most people figure it out by then and just stop finding a need to return. Which is why most of the narrative is coming from early stage guys towards vets, and vets to early guys. The narrative is clearly intended for this specific niche, though every now and then some vet to vet shit comes through, which is why people like me stick around. Don't get me wrong, the content is still true, but there is a level of vitriol that exists. It's mainly there for two reasons. First to keep people like you away. This is a mans space meant for men, directed by men. We don't want you even stopping by. By keeping the heat up, it ensures that you will hate it, thus staying far away. The second is ambition. When you tell a boy about to play his first game of ball, you tell him, ""Go out there and kill them!"" Now you don't really mean that, but you got to add that color to drive the point home.

Either way, that's my personal view of the sub. You're seeing a ""normal"" side of me right now, but that's because we aren't in the TRP space. I do think TRP is a great resource for all men that are trying to focus on self improvement and becoming a better person in our society. You may not see it that way, and that's perfectly fine. As a woman you think a bit differently than men, as we think differently than you. So sometimes when you look at something that the other gender is doing, it's confusing. It happens on both sides. Fucking industries are built around bridging the mental gender gap that exists. Frankly, we have no desire to bridge that gender gap so you can understand it. Because we don't care. There is no added value in toning it down just so you can understand.

Finally, this was long and probably fairly disconnected. I'd go back and clean it up but I've been on a conference call for the past hour and am moving back and forth typing this. "

Consenting to oral, or allowing someone to do it if that is what he wants, seems like a means of feeding someones physical appetite so that they are willing to spend time with you. These are intimate moments that are meant to be shared with people you care about, or at the very least a temporary passionate lust that you get caught up in with someone resulting in a one night stand if that's what you're looking for. Your views on sex seem unhealthy, and not because of your choice to abstain."

ChipSteezy,wiiu,1388618064.0,"You don't have to give me evidence? Then neither do I. That isn't how arguments work.

I'm a 17 year old asian? You are clearly intolerant. Step off your high horse pal. You just stereotyped me as a white male, because I happen to have a positive opinion on Bill O'Reilly? That's intolerance, and borderline racist. Do you not like white people or something man? 

If you've ever even watched the O'Reilly show past the clips you've seen on Reddit, and Jon stewart. You would see that he's highly educated on politics, and receives a bad reputation from closed minded individuals like yourself, who probably don't even watch his show to begin with. I defended him in the context that he provides evidence in his shows. I never revealed my ethnicity, or my political beliefs, yet you've stereotyped me as a conservative 40 year old white man. 

Now if you had actually read the argument I had with the other guy, you would see that he found proof of correlation and I happened to agree that there is correlation between desensitization and violent video games. But there is no direct causation.

The way you keep spouting off swears only shows your ""argument"" (which is really only a pissing natch now) is just you arguing for the sake of argument. Did you read the article I posted? Do you have any articles? Do you have anything to contribute besides ""fuck you"" or ""peace, bitch""..? 

I'm not going to stoop to your level, and start stereotyping races, but you should know better than that.

Am I allowed to have my own opinion without being stereotyped or insulted? I have presented my argument peacefully, and you're escalating something so simple into race, and politics.

If you want to go this route, I'd suggest traveling to Hong Kong or Singapore where English is widely spoken.  That said most people can speak English in major cities so language won't necessarily be a huge barrier.  Culture is going to be the big one.

It sounds like we are going to places with complete opposite attitudes in regards to children in the waiting room.

I was only offended because I go to a doctors office with strict rules about that and the fathers did not leave the waiting room at all. I go to a huge building with a ton of doctors offices, waterfalls in the main building and seating area everywhere, indoors. If they are not physically going into the exam room why not sit in one of the many seating areas? They know the rules and it just bothers me how they aren't abiding by them when so many couples do.

&gt;OK. So you've provided a motive. But you have yet to prove that they acted according to this motive.

 Are you the BFL lawyer? There's no need to prove anything. It's enough to point out that all alternative actions are worse from their point of view. We assume a rational motive here.

&gt;Another motive would be BFL doing their best to deliver functional hardware to miners, as fast as they can, because this - in and of itself - is a profitable venture. Additionally, if they are honest, they don't risk punishment in criminal or civil court from unhappy customers.

This is a wrong assumption. It's not about hardware sales being a profitable venture. It's about keeping the hardware as long as possible being **more** profitable. Think about it. There is no incentive to ship early - it's prepaid. But you make money each day you hold on. What would *any* rational person do?

- Public funding, if it's a public school.

I'm sure I'm missing out on other forms of income, but this seems ridiculous to me. Take UCLA for instance. This is a public school that gets funding from the state, but also makes a great deal of money off of it's sports program. I know they have buildings to keep up, people to pay, research programs to fund, etc. UCLA is not as expensive as USC as far as tuition, but the income that is generated seems like it far out weighs the expenses.

Everywhere I turn in this culture I hear about the amazingness of big boobs!"" We're all self-conscious about something, so there's the psychological side. 

The physical side... yes, barring extremes it's just not a big issue (ba dum ching). I don't have an internal measuring tape! It really is just different every time, and it's not just length, it's shape and the size of each of your bodies and how you fit together (or don't). I've had sex with guys with big dicks that was amazing, but also really unpleasant painful sex. And on the flip side, I've had phenomenal sex with guys on the smaller end, and also disappointing sex.

Thom0,todayilearned,1388618660.0,"Alright, I've read this like 20 times in this thread and its not true. If you want to get down to the ass hole of the matter then you can easily argue a difference between what each is founded on and which one is crazy and which one isn't.


Christianity is a mongrel blend of several schools of philosophy, Platonic philosophy is the main one. Metaphysics aside you can find a clear logical foundation. You can agree of disagree with religion all day but the idea of loving others equally and so on are still strong philosophical matters and they aren't bullshit. All in all the bible is a great philosophical text regardless of whether or not you agree with the notion of God. Some good stuff is in those pages, the same way good stuff can be found in a text written by Derrida, Nietzsche, Kant or anyone else credible for that matter. Logic is the key, the philosophy applies to life or is somehow a commentary on life. Its hard to explain but its good writing, the same way a book can be a shit read or a great read.

Scientology on the other hand is, well, crazy. A main philosophy of Scientology is obviously Dianetics which if you argue to the floor boards simply doesn't hold. Its based on the assumption that Xenu happened and all the past life business occurred, its foundations lie in very shaky metaphysics. If it was a logical assumption, one that could be backed up with at least some kind of mental proof or sound reasoning then it would be at best a passable school of thought.

There is more to it than that but its late and I need to finish college work, basically they both aren't crazy."

I recall a silent treatment when I was very young wherein she couldn't talk to me about what I wanted to eat for breakfast, so just made nothing for me. At most, I was not quite six years old. So I went next door to my grandmother's house where large plates of food were still set out on the table for everyone to have breakfast. My mother was so mad. 

I'm pretty sure events like that figured in her decision to convince my dad we had to get away from the families. When I was just gone six, we moved 1000 miles away from anyone and anything we'd ever known. My mother always said it saved her marriage and my childhood because she could finally mother me uninterrupted by relatives. The thing is, she didn't mother me.

Believe it or not, even that can become routine after a while. Another warm body in my bed just became part of my standard weekend activity.

Part of it had to do with the kind of people I was surrounding myself with. All around me where people with a seemingly endless string of stupid relationship problems and strained marriages. And on the other end there was an abundance of available, willing, and adventurous women who where bad bets for anything more than flings. I certainly knew which option looked better to me.

Back in the 90s the Ontario Appeal Court voted 2-1 that it is OK for citizens to engage in sexual activity in cars as long as they make a serious attempt to park away from prying eyes. That was extended across all of Canada since it was a federal law they were ruling on.

&gt; Surely young couples conducting their courtships in automobiles in dark secluded (although public) places are not committing criminal offences simply because curious onlookers seek to approach and look into such vehicles to satisfy their curiosity.

librarygirl,AskReddit,1388619535.0,"Firstly - the word 'slutty' has a time and a place and my contribution here isn't it, so I'm going to say 'sexually liberal' instead.

Secondly - I'm going to give my Dad's perspective with regards to my sister, so if you only want to hear actual responses from parents, don't read on.

Disclaimers out of the way, my Dad is currently struggling to deal with the behaviour of my almost-eighteen y.o. sister (we are in the UK so she is of legal consenting age). He thinks it is wrong that she brings home boys he doesn't know, they stay over and leave in the morning, and a few times he has heard what goes on (and once walked in. Poor guy). It's not a different guy every week, but maybe an unfamiliar guy/one-night stand once every few weeks. There was one guy who was obviously using her for a while but she really liked him, he'd slip out before dawn. My parents have always been liberal, but my sister is engaging in casual sex, I guess, and I know it upsets him a lot.

My opinion is that she can do what she wants, as long as she's doing it for the right reasons. She's a beautiful, cool, funny young girl, she has tons of friends, she has a wonderful heart. She's honest and hard-working and she does well in school, off to Uni this year. But she also indulges a lot, and I think that's ok as long as she respects herself.

Dad has pretty much never told us what we can and can't do, but now he has. He's told her no more random boys, and is hoping she'll grow out of it or maybe just find something more permanent. He is always there, and always expects the best of us, he doesn't need reprimand or punishment to get us to act right because we do, naturally, and out of respect for him. She's pushed it too far, it greatly upsets him, but ultimately I think he knows he can't tell her what to do with her body.

Hope this has provided some insight, OP. "

mr_fishy,asexuality,1388619745.0,"Don't worry, it's totally normal to be worried about this sort of thing. Since you're worried about pain, I assume you're female-bodied? Or are you concerned about hurting a female-bodied partner? Either way, I'll try to give you some tips.

1. Don't have sex before you're ready. This should seem obvious, but a lot of teens are pressured into doing something that they later regret. I'm not going to tell you that you absolutely shouldn't have sex until you're older (although 15 is a little young, and can have legal implications depending on where you live and the age of your partner). However, if you want to have sex you should make sure that you're doing it because it's what you want, not because you feel obligated to or your partner wants you to do it.

2. Just because you aren't ""turned on"" by someone in general doesn't mean that your body won't have a physiological response to sexual situations. Even as an ace, if someone touches you, you will most likely experience some parts of physical arousal - for instance, if you are female bodied you will still lubricate or ""get wet."" This is something that happens regardless of sexual desire - women's bodies have evolved to be that way in case of sexual trauma so that they aren't severely hurt. So if you are concerned about lubrication, this will most likely not be an issue, although if it is you can still use artificial lubricant.

3. This leads to your comment about condom/lube use. [This link](http://www.healthyhorns.utexas.edu/hs_lube.html) has some quick tips for combinations of condoms and lube. You can buy these sorts of things online or in any drug store. Just make sure to read all instructions carefully to make sure that you are using each product correctly, and that combining them won't cause issues - usually a lube will have a label saying if it is safe for use with latex condoms. I would highly recommend using a condom, even if you or your partner is using other forms of birth control, to reduce the risk of infections or STDs. Safer sex every time means you develop good habits and have less risk in the future!

4. Go slowly. Especially if it is your first time having sex. Instead of jumping straight into penetrative sex, take a little bit of time to kiss and touch with your partner. You can then move on to manual stimulation or oral sex. This will help for a lot of reasons - first, it will help you become more familiar with your partner and get more comfortable with them. Second, it can help you become more physically relaxed and receptive to sex. If you have vaginal sex, it allows for more time to produce enough lubrication. Once you do start having penetrative vaginal or anal sex, you should still go slowly at first. For someone who is female-bodied, it will most likely be uncomfortable or even slightly painful at first if you have an unbroken hymen. If at any point you or your partner experiences moderate/high amounts of pain, stop right away. Sex should never hurt that badly (unless you want it to).

5. Once you become sexually active, you should make sure to tell your doctor. If you are female-bodied, this often also means starting to see a gynocologist. Most doctors recommend that you start seeing a gyno when you are 18 or if you are sexually active, whichever comes first. This is important for your continued sexual health - going to see your gyno for regular pap smears ensures that you don't have any issues, and the gyno can also answer any questions you have about sex or sexual health and address any issues you might have.

I hope that answers a lot of the questions you have so far. If you want to know anything else, shoot me a reply or a message. This was just generic info that would be helpful for anyone but I can also tell you more about my personal experience if you're interested."

It's pretty much the same as other sports like football (soccer), basketball, hockey etc. Football is an example I'm somewhat familiar with. Every team plays in their region, Eredivisie, Bundesliga, EPL, whatever. Only the top team participate in international tournaments. And they're not even that many games, because the players need their rest. 

There's a lot of discussion over which is the best compitition to play. A lot of people say the EPL or Bundesliga are very strong leagues, because all the teams have an excellent quality, while other people prefer La Liga or Serie A, because they have a few teams who're just amazing. Very similar to LoL, no? And in football as well, the only time these teams match up against each other is during a single yearly tournament.
The fact that no one exactly knows how the teams match up is great for so many reasons. There's the hype, the mystery, the discussions.

shortversionisthis,relationships,1388619912.0,"Totally that girl here. My boyfriend had a full beard for a few months before he had to report for service with the Army. I LOVED his beard. Then one day I go to pick him up at his temporary, part-time job (retail), only to find that he shaved off the sides but left a Guy Fawkes style beard and mustache, then went to work like that. I fucking flipped my shit. 

For me, it was mostly about ""the team."" I like to be very involved with my boyfriend (always have been, always will be, regardless of who the boyfriend is). I require a high level of emotional intimacy. He knows that, and we are committed to it. We call our relationship a team-- we are always each other's first priority, first person to communicate big news to, the first person we go to if there's a problem or we need support (ie his dad has prostate cancer, he comes to me to talk about it instead of his best friend, I talk to him if I have a problem at work, etc.), etc. We are a team and we consistently put each other first. 

When he shaved his beard and didn't tell me, I didn't feel like I was on his team. This is embarrassingly petty, but it felt like he wasn't getting enough attention from me and therefore needed to get it from work in a way that excluded me. Had he texted me a picture before work or told me what he was doing beforehand, it would have been fine. I would have felt privileged with the information. Instead, it felt like he deliberately circumvented me. 

We talked out my crazy and apologized to one another. Sounds like you and your girlfriend need to have a similar conversation (but in that conversation, perhaps address whether or not you both have the same expectations of communication, commitment, priority, and intimacy). "

neekz0r,explainlikeimfive,1388620093.0,"Mostly, there are two major graphics card chips: nvidia and ATI. Most manufactures take those two and add the card part.

First choice, then, is which one do you favor? 

Second choice: the actual manufacturer. Each manufacturer has a product line, but lets not focus on that just yet. What you are looking for here is support, warranty, and general quality. 

Finally, we get into the product line. This is where things like overclocking and how much memory the graphics card has. The more the CPU is overclocked, the more expensive it is. Same with RAM, the more it has the more expensive. 

So important attributes: chipset, manufactuer warranty, and then CPU clock speed, cores, and memory. 

The ultimate measurement, however, is FPS rendering. That's what it all comes down to. However, it's a widely acknowledged 'secret' that the companies cheat on such tests. 

So, in short, pick a handful that are within your budget and that have good warranties, and then look online for FPS rendering tests. Lots of websites provide these details.

Every fourth instance you're asking Penny, meaning it's a proper noun, not the coin. Penny could be a pet, or a person most likely. The possibility remains that you're asking for a penny in broken English, but you wouldn't typically follow a standardized pattern for that. Because your speech pattern is this consistent, you're either trying to get an animal's attention, you're waiting on someone that you don't necessarily want to be with (due to the consistent knocking before asking), or Penny has another meaning to you that hasn't yet been defined. 

The possibility does exist that you're just trying to be funny about it, but there's usually a hint of truth in such things, and I would presume that either it was a random string that popped into your head just to screw with me, or it fits the above scenario.

Traditional economics proposes that **economic actors should not let sunk costs influence their decisions**. Doing so would not be rationally assessing a decision exclusively on its own merits

Colleges will price their product (education IS a product) the same way any other business (colleges ARE a business) would price their product: competitively, as determined by the market, and based strictly on future expectations of revenue.

They would have an easier time fulfilling obligations incurred by sunk costs than almost any other industry in the United States, since, having more cash reserves than many actual banks, they could either amortize or immediately pay off any existing construction debts out of pocket, rather than having to apply for, borrow, and pay interest upon what traditional businesses refer to as ""operating capital loans."""

we can't treat every single person on the internet like they are fragile and going to break if we say 1 negative thing to them; it's just not fair to everyone else. I would hate being treated as fragile and whatever when I was depressed. it makes me feel terrible and useless. I would much rather be trash talked than treated as some fragile, helpless depressed guy

this is coming from a depressed person who used league as an outlet for several years. i've cried from what people said to me before but i realized it was my own fault and not because people should treat everyone stupidly nice on the internet. it's just dumb to place the blame on other people. it's a hopeless situation if you look at it that way and you're not going to change anything. 

if you're not old or smart enough to deal with people on the internet you really shouldn't be using it. going on a morality crusade is not going to fix anything sadly; the only thing that is feasibly changeable is the mindset of depressed people."

If you can't meet my eye, it's very difficult to make a connection with you.

You can tell a lot about a person from their shoes.

I may have to work with this person every day - qualifications aside, are they easy to get along with? Will I enjoy seeing them around?

If this person is this nervous/awkward with me, how are they going to deal with customers/clients/other staff?

General presentation:

Always have questions prepared, always have company knowledge.

Bring a notepad and pen, jot down the answers the employer gives, carrying it makes you look smart and prepared. Also carry a copy of your CV - if they don't have one already you'll look super efficient pulling one out for them.

Wear a watch, wear clean shoes, iron your shit. I don't mean shirt - I mean shit, as in iron *everything*.

Be 10 minutes early.

Shake hands on meeting and departing, even if the interviewer doesn't initiate it.

I always tell myself, I'm not meeting a potential boss, I'm meeting a person. I've met *people* before, right?

I'll post more if I think of any. Best of luck."

Misanthropy-Divine,introvert,1388620673.0,"Sounds familiar. The first thing I'd recommend is to grow out some facial hair. Even a soul patch will add a few years onto a young face, and once you find a facial hair style that compliments your face, you just feel more confident and know that you look even better than you did. I only recently shaved off the goatee I'd been nursing for the past two-and-a-half years because I felt that it was time for me to move away from it.

Meanwhile, I'd recommend quitting your job. It sounds like you're in a toxic work environment and need to get out. Do so immediately, and then start looking for a new job. Rinse, lather, and repeat as necessary until you find one that has a decent work environment.

Third, you're going into college. Even just going along in day-to-day life, you're going to be meeting people almost every day, and you'll meet them at unexpected times. For example, I met my best friend and another good friend of mine in the same political science course. It'll take some time, but trust me, if you take a chance with talking to someone, the chances are at least 50/50 that you'll hit it off, especially if they approach you. If not, then it doesn't really matter, because they're not in your life anyway. They shouldn't have an effect on you, because they're not attached to you, nor you to them.

Fourth, going to therapy might be wise. Along with that, I'd also recommend /r/SuicideWatch, and I'd also recommend /r/howtonotgiveafuck. The latter one especially helped me loosen up in several ways, and led to a couple of revelations that have really helped me get out there and live life on my terms.

Hope this helps; let me know if you have any questions."

Kzickas,FeMRADebates,1388620729.0,"&gt;Considering the first quote, do women really benefit from a gender bias in custody battles?

I'd assume so. A single study isn't by itself a huge thing.

&gt;If a perception of gender bias may discourage fathers from seeking custody, should the MRM promote the findings of these studies to encourage fathers to seek custody?

Only if the perception is wrong. Otherwise you're just tricking people into a demanding and expensive process for no gain. 

&gt; Since stereotypes about fathers are damaging their chances in court, does feminism attempting to weaken gender roles help fathers receive custody?

Weakening gender roles would certainly help. But I don't usually think the ways feminists try to do so are going to be very effective (if I did I would presumably be a feminist rather than an MRA)

&gt;91% of custody cases are settled out of court; are those cases unfair to men?

zoeyversustheraccoon,trees,1388620835.0,"WA resident here.

CO's law is a lot more sensible in many ways but up here in WA we still have a bit of a nanny-state mentality and CO's law probably wouldn't have  passed.  The only way many people in WA would be comfortable with legalization is if the state were involved in the retailing and there was heavy regulation.  

A lot of people don't know that until the middle of 2012, retail liquor sales went through a statewide network of government-owned (or specially licensed in very rural areas) liquor stores, with limited hours and no sales on Sunday.  It was a holdover from the prohibition era and it took repeated attempts and big money from Costco to get the system changed.  

And CO is getting all of the attention right now because legal retailing is underway, whereas WA still needs a few more months to get its act together.  Ironically, the WA liquor control board, the Star Chamber of liquor retailing for decades, now performs a similar role overseeing marijuana retailing.  

Despite that, we're already seeing some softening on the law passed here (for example, initially nobody could grow for personal use own but now medical users can do it).  It's just a matter of time before the legislature decides to amend the law to make things more practical.  

BTW I think Bart may be overselling the tax impact.  It works more like VAT, where there will be a 25% tax for the retail customer at the end, but it's not 25% on top of 25% on top of 25%.  So yeah I might pay $100 for a quarter that costs $75-80 on the street...but it'll be so worth it.  No more hassles of hooking up via CL, no more shady situations, and I'll be able to get pretty much what I want at my convenience.

I actually asked my counselor ""I'm not too sold on college; I like working with my hands--what about trade schools.""  The counselor actually pulled out my test results (IQ, SAT, etc) and said, basically, that somebody with my numbers should not consider anything but a four-year college.

Yes, the tone in the movie is all over the place (the scenes with Sauron contrasted with the relatively silly barrel scene, for instance). Yes, I think that's a legitimate criticism. I don't think that undermines the IMO accurate point that Jackson is more consistent about certain elements. To me, Olsen's strongest argument bar none is about Jackson's treatment of the Ring. It's far more consistent with how the Ring functions in LOTR."

For your dog, she may be more protective than you think. Many years ago I had a situation while managing a small motel where I was worried about a guy breaking into the office. My husband was gone, I was there with my son and dog and had just gotten off the motel phone with him. I had told him that he and his friend couldn't stay for the night, because he creeped me out, and he started ranting on the phone. After I hung up I realized my son was up at the office and might unlock the door so I ran up to check.

I got there and the guy's friend was was at the door and our dog, a beagle, was ready to go through the door at him. This was a gentle dog, normally very friendly but she was in full defense mode, standing in front of my son and barking at this guy. I pulled her back and the friend said they were going to leave, just don't call the cops, then he left the door. I had never seen that dog nor did I ever see her again become that defensive and ready to go after someone. So your dog will probably also act protective, if you need her to. And it was scary being there by myself, my husband happened to call and check on me and got me calmed down. This was before cell phones so I was very happy for the timing of his call.

Based on the time, it looks like your friend should either be on their way or be with you. Things will ease and it wasn't your fault. Good luck to you and glad you will press charges if they find the guy."

flashmedallion,assassinscreed,1388621185.0,"I think the other thing missing there though is that the Templars have always, by their own admission, been aligned with slavery.  That is their goal.

Add the whole ""this is totally not a reference to the NSA"" [spoiler](#s ""Observatory"") to that as well - the Templars are presented as ""the bad guys"".  Well-intentioned, well-meaning, but neverless people who seek to enslave.

Assassins Creed *does* have an ideological agenda, and that that is the ideals of the Assassins.  It uses it's setting to explore history and paint us a picture of the results of well-intentioned, well-meaning, tyrants (the focus on Captalism as a tool for oppression in Brotherhood was also timed with Occupy Wall Street, which was current).  

The trick is that it doesn't pretend that there aren't good arguments for the Templars goals - it's not trying to get people to mindlessly buy into the idea that ""Fascism is bad"" (sound like a familiar goal?). The Templars are allowed to appear reasonable because that is the most dangerous thing about them - but unquestioning resistance to something is never going to solve anything.  The two ""sides"" get equal treatment because a mature reasoning of the debate (i.e. education) is the only solution that doesn't just wind up in warfare.

So make no mistake - The Templars want to enslave.  Whether or not they have noble intentions, the one thing that the series has come down on time and time again is that enslavement is *never* a good thing.  Freedom Cry makes that a little more blunt, but after all this time I think they've earned that."

It's not accurate for LOTR, though -- Elrond already had his own realm at the time, as he founded Rivendell in S.A. 1697, and Sauron was overthrown in S.A. 3441 -- nearly 2,000 years later. Elrond was Gil-Galad's standard bearer during the final battle at Barad-dur, meaning he fought with him and was a member of his personal guard.

hezec,MapPorn,1388621372.0,"&gt; What's in a dictionary is usually the minority prestige dialect of a language.

Is it really? I don't think *anyone, anywhere* actually speaks or often even writes their language *precisely* as it's taught in books outside of highly formal contexts. Prescriptive linguistics just attempt (attempts? Yeah, you understand anyway) to make rules for those occasions where it's actually important to ""look good"" and at the same time provide neutral guidelines which normal people should roughly follow to be understandable to as wide an audience as possible. Especially in the modern era of worldwide communication I'd say that is quite important.

Nobody is (hopefully) telling people they can't use their own dialect at home. I'm aware that hasn't always been the case but usually it has been part of a wider policy of ""national purism"" in those instances and not really linguistics anymore.

[Here](http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?l=en&amp;s=3) is what the Institute for the Languages of Finland has to say on the matter:

&gt; Language is a resource that belongs to us all. The Institute thus strives to issue guidelines that are as clear, simple and easy to apply as possible for all members of the linguistic community in any given context."

JonnyRichter,NoShitSherlock,1388621415.0,"Wow. Where are you regurgitating this from? First off:

&gt;Slavery is extremely efficient. Paying foxconn workers $2 an hour is very efficient.

Calling it slavery is just hyperbole. If they were paid $8, like the California minimum wage, you would be complaining about iPhones costing $2,400. And those people wouldn't be employed, because no business in China would employ them, since no one is buying their products at such ridiculous prices. 

&gt;Efficiency loses sight of why we work in the first place: independence. Low wages creates government dependency.

So your argument is that businesses should be forced to pay people more than the revenue they bring in? How incredibly hypocritical that you are not willing to help these people with your taxes, but expect businesses to be completely altruistic and donate all of their profit to charity.

&gt;Also, raising the minimum wage does not increase unemployment. The minimum wage is still historically low compared to our country's better decades:

Eh, wrong. This is an incredibly misled argument. When the price of your labor goes up, you start laying off those who do not qualify for the price of that labor in exchange for those who can get more work done in the same time. And then you raise your prices.

Anyone who spouts off the ""minimum wage doesn't increase UE"" hasn't the slightest clue what they're talking about."

crankypants15,FeMRADebates,1388621427.0,"To say that there is ""judicial bias"" in every case, or most cases, in most states, I don't think would be accurate. I think it happens, but I'm not convinced it's a trend. IMO, the problem is before the court case which would fight for custody. Typically in a divorce in Michigan the mom gets custody of the children while it's fought who will get the kids in the end. It can take months just for an initial hearing, and that's not the real hearing to decide who gets the kids. During this time the man has to pay child support, and possibly alimony, and he often leaves the house, forced out by the wife through various means. This means he has to come up with cash for an apartment, child support, and alimony, which his current income may not support. Remember, CS in Michigan is calculated based on income. He may have been paying X to raise a kid before he left, now he's paying 3X-5X in CS. That huge expense hardly leaves anything left to pay for a court case. 

The day I left the house from an abusive wife is the day I was responsible for child support. I was very short on cash. 

All these expenses preclude even creating a child custody court case. Therefore, men don't even have the cash to fight for custody, due to various (many outdated) laws and customs. *Having the right to fight for custody and having the cash to fight for custody are 2 very different things.* It doesn't matter which rights you have if you don't have the cash to enforce your rights.

Source: I went through the divorce process in Michigan. Any judicial bias might be during the phase where custody is being argued, and the mom gets custody automatically in many cases. While the argument ""mom is best for  the kids"" may have been true most of the time in the 1970s (lets face it, not many men  knew much about proper parenting back then), it's no longer true, but the rule is still being used in some places by judges.

Borror0,DepthHub,1388621490.0,"First, the working class and uneducated Americans wouldn't be unemployed would protectionist policies. Even if we disregard the law of comparative advantage, at best wages and prices would go down while unemployment would remain roughly stable in the long run. Wages are subject to supply and demand, unless the minimum wage gets in the way. If there's less demand for employees, then wages will simply go down until we reach equilibrium once again. Now, that's a gross simplification (wages are sticky, minimum wage generates unemployment, etc.) but it's true enough to be meaningful. 

If free trade caused unemployment, we'd have noticed it by now.

Secondly, it's ridiculous to portray Europe as a place where ""[m]any of the regulations we have for food, drugs, machinery, medical supplies, etc. are lax or non-existent."" The point isn't that we need less regulation. According to /u/King_of_Avalon, the ECE standards are more stringent than the FMVSS standards. It's that different regulations can act as a trade barrier, by virtue of being different. It's why Canada copies American standards: otherwise, the price of cars and the available selection would be limited. It is true also of other standards, where shared standards facilitates trade as good from one region can be sold in another. It enables competition between countries, which drives prices down.

anonlymouse,martialarts,1388621501.0,"I guess the influence of Chun on boxing depends on the boxing. If you look at classical boxing, before the bear cat style that guys like Driscoll complained about, it has a lot in common with what you see in Wing Chun, so someone who trained that style wouldn't likely get much extra from training Wing Chun. Someone who trains more conventional boxing would get a more classical boxing alternative from training Wing Chun. You could still get that without the WC, but I think you could reasonably say that it offered a reasonable contribution to the boxing. The Chi Sao is another part, it's harder to clinch and pummel on a Chunner than a regular boxer, which if combined with good wrestling means you can better use your striking to close and clutch than a simple punch and clutch style would offer, and you'd also be better able to stop someone from closing on you."

Because there are many more far right-wing extremists and generally uninformed people in the US.

This is such bullshit. Look at the votes for individual bills for proof.

The problem is that the democrats are a centrist party with people from the left, right, and center.

ratajewie,todayilearned,1388621673.0,"You stand on a field and throw a ball to someone. It takes 5 seconds to get to them. The field then gets twice as big. This makes it so the ball takes 10 seconds to get to the other person now. If you threw it before the field got bigger, it would take 5 seconds. If you throw it after, it takes 10 seconds. If you stood even CLOSER to the person before the field got bigger, it would take 2 seconds to throw him the ball. If, while you were that close, you threw the ball and the field expanded to the size I mentioned before while the ball was in the air, it would take the ball maybe 5 seconds to get the the person. But now, you're so far away that if you threw the ball now, it would take 10 seconds.
The universe started out closer than 14 billion light years away. Say, 5 billion light years. As the universe expanded, the light had to travel further than 5 billion light years. By the time the light got to us, the universe between us and the galaxy had expanded SO much that the galaxy was now 30 billion light years away. The light was moved back too, but it moved faster than the universe expanded so it didn't get pushed back THAT much. (I say moved back because it wouldn't get slowed down, so much as move slower relative to a stationary point, since we're assuming the movement of the universe was negative and the movement of light was positive.) It took 14 billion years to get to us, which is about as old as the universe itself. The galaxy is now 30 billion light years away, but is still not older than the universe. It just got pushed back so far that it would take light 30 billion years to get to us NOW."

I'll update with my outfit after I shower (it's 9:15am right now). Also looking forward to arriving in LA in about 35 minutes loltimetravel.

edit: [album](http://imgur.com/a/A9rBw), sorry for the shitty mirror selfies, this is why I don't post in WAYWT

Also [here's a pic](http://imgur.com/ZYf3KNd) with my coat ($80 k-mart clearance circa 2009) and the amazing bag ($60 H&amp;M) I bought last month for work. It's a good price point for me, cause I'll take care of it but I won't feel bad about using it. Not taking it to LA though.

My resolution is to get my mojo back. (TMI alert) 2013 was the worst year of sex I've ever had. The first eight months or so were plagued by chronic yeast infections. Fucking scented toilet paper, took me forever to figure out that that's what was triggering it, and even then I needed to treat it multiple times. I kind of gave up on feeling sexy and started eating ice cream. Bad news, and my attitude and social life went to shit.

My plan for this next week is to go bra shopping. I've been wearing my lone sports bra every day for the past month because all my other bras are incredibly uncomfortable, and none of my clothes fit with them. I'm supposed to be somewhere around 30H but I guess it depends on the brand. Last time I was home I went to Nordstrom and the lady put me in 34G. So frickin uncomfortable, the bands stretched out within two days.

The old argument against 50/50 child custody is: men in general focus on their jobs, while women in general focus on the kids. The problem here is assuming things about an individual with no evidence. 
Assuming an individual man is a poor parent is an assumption with no evidence.

A woman approaches the lifeboat, pleading with those inside to give up their seats. Imagine there is just one man in the lifeboat. He is the same age as her and they have the same job/education/marital status etcetera. The man in this situation is expected to give up his seat. The only way he'll be exempted from this expectation is is he's either very valuable to society directly (i.e. He has a prestigious job or something similar) or he has a more pressing family obligation (i.e. He is a father). 

I'm no MRA but I think this theory has some merit. If you're really interested in learning more about it google ""culture of the disposable male"". Especially pay attention to the webcast ""girl says what?""

thingsliveundermybed,relationships,1388622078.0,"I have IC, and it is awful. But lying to her doctor and failing at self-care is a *huge* no no. Avoiding drinking water is a bad move. There are loads of online resources for IC, different treatments, supplements... For example, is she on the IC diet? What treatment has she received? There are so many angles to come at IC from. You might have to throw some money at supplements and the right foods, but consider it an investment. My partner does a lot for me, and sex isn't as frequent as we'd both like. But I try very hard to show my appreciation. And when I have a good day (hell, a good hour) I jump his bones so as not to waste the chance!

I agree with other posters: this is about more than health. She has never enjoyed sex, by the sound of it. Ever. She has begun to associate it with fear and pain, naturally. Ideally she needs to take an active role in her own care (if you want I'll get on my laptop tomorrow and link you to some websites, on my phone atm) and seek physical therapy and counselling for her IC, vaginismus, and anxiety. And she needs to come clean with her doctor. They are probably wondering why she isn't getting better and she could be doing more damage.

Edit: I just read further down the thread she drinks beer daily. Oh boy. She is actively hurting herself. And if she drinks coffee too... Time to put your foot down.

There are worrying indications that she doesn't appreciate you enough. The way you describe it, even if she's in perfect health after she goes into remission from IC and gets rid of the kidney stones, it still seems unlikely you'd have a good sex life. Remember, health problems are something you can work around if you both want to. At the moment, sadly, it doesn't sound like she wants to. I am so sorry for both of you having to deal with this."

Places I'm aware of people getting comfortable with....

*  **School:** I went to the same junior and high school, but I think 7 different elementary. I touch base with a number of classmates still, but never got to date any: the home life at the time precluded it.
*  **Community/church:** I have never lived in the same house more than four years. I made a lot of friends in different places, but again, not many female friends in such settings.
* **College:** I went to community college. When you study IT as a guy, the women your age are taken, and so are the ones twice your age, trying to reboot their careers. No dorm setting to get involved into Greek society, parties, sports, and the like.
* **Clubs:** I'm more comfortable wandering into some random place to chat people up, than to try getting with a random gal in a bar/club. 
* **Non-church groups:** as I've noticed, a lot of these have the community college dynamic. You don't get dates playing board games or discussing irreligion.

Thanks to online meetup and dating, I've had several relationships that lasted more than a few weeks (3.5 years the longest): Hell, I still talk to quite a few of the women I've been intimate with. I've made a crapload of friends I would have never met: people as penpals, and people I meet in real life.

Frankly, most relationships can't survive a step backwards, so in terms of risk assessment, she is probably correct in having her own place/stuff since the chances of you lasting together are pretty small.

What should have happened is that your actions should have caused the relationship to end, and then you would hopefully have learned a lesson for your next relationship.

In case you still haven't learned the lesson, let me spell it out for you.  

Any time one person in a relationship loses an argument, you both lose.  Each time you held it over her head to ""win"", you were just damaging the relationship and making her resent you.  

Problems in a relationship should therefore not be you versus her, but the two of you versus the problem.  If there is an issue or bad feelings, you should each take turns talking about your feelings calmly, listen closely, and then work on finding solutions together."

BinghamL,snakes,1388622285.0,"Well I have to give you props. It seems like you're thoroughly researching this, and have previously and currently cared for other pets. I would clear things up on the ""worst case scenario"" as far as vet bills are concerned with your parents if you can't afford them. Also call around and find your nearest exotic vet and their hours, and then find your nearest animal emergency hospital that have facilities to care for reptiles (not all of them do).

I don't mean to harp on this scenario by any means. I was thrown into a situation where I had none of that information (my fault) and had to acquire it at a very inopportune time (post-injury). If you do all the leg work now, you won't be nearly as stressed if a situation arises where you need that info (it's very possible that won't happen).

I've also been taking my rtb in for annual check ups, it's roughly $50 and gives you peace of mind and assurance that you are indeed taking good care of your snake. It's something I would consider, but is not required. It is almost fun though, the snake gets so much attention because they're rarely brought in that you almost feel like a celebrity lol. A bit of a tangent but in throwing parties and taking my snake to the vet I've realized she is far, far more popular than I am."

To top all that off, instead of increasing government spending, and widening the medicare levy (healthcare tax) our current government is cutting spending, and attempting to impose a static amount as a 'cost' per GP visit, and if that passes, who knows what else will end up with a cost attached.

But Sam did not put it on; for even as he clasped it to his breast, an orc came clattering down. Leaping out of a dark opening at the right, it ran towards him. It was no more than six paces from him when, lifting its head, it saw him; and Sam could hear its gasping breath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes. It stopped short aghast. For what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit trying to hold a steady sword: it saw a great silent shape, cloaked in a grey shadow, looming against the wavering light behind; in one hand it held a sword, the very light of which was a bitter pain, the other was clutched at its breast, but held concealed some nameless menace of power and doom."""

Spot-welding is where you get two sheets of steel and press them together with electrodes that weld that 'spot'. What happened there would be called a 'tack weld' which is just a word that means the initial short weld that positions two pieces.

Not strictly relevant, and you'd have to imagine that a dude clever enough to tie his shoelaces would be clever enough to know that drilling through a laptop would be a Bad Plan, but just in defense of all people who don't understand computers be aware that plenty of computer people don't understand anything outside of computers.

Its been a while since ive done an episode of this. All is explained in the video as to why, so I wont write it all down here. 

In this episode, I take on the Geth on Firebase Dagger with the Asari Justicar weilding Krysae. Without reave. 

Now, in this one, I run over by about 2 minutes. Its certainly possible to go sub 45 minutes, but given the map and enemy combo, it was pretty tough to be careful but efficiant. There is no real spot to lock down on dagger, as the two long channels on the map both have spawns behind them, which lead to me kiting more than I wanted too. I was tempted to redo it, but it really didn't seem worth it for the sake of 1 minute and 57 seconds. 

The music chosen for this episode is an electro house mix by SuicideSheep. You can find the full mix [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5c7yeg8Apk). 

As always, I would appreciate your suggestions for the next episode and I hope you enjoy the video!

MSUtimmy,buildapcsales,1388622494.0,"I own this capture card. I use it mostly for recording and streaming my Xbox 360 at 720p.

It suits my needs perfectly. Picture quality is impeccable. It is NOT the end-all-be-all of HD capture cards, though. 

If you plan on streaming with this, do NOT use the RECentral software bundled with it. Use OBS or other equivalents and use your CPU to encode. The onboard h.264 encoding is subpar, not worth buying this product for. Make sure your CPU is fast enough to encode x.264 at a medium preset and that your internet upload is &gt;5Mbps if you want a quality 720p stream.

The biggest piece of knowledge to know about this card is that there is an audio sync problem when recording at 1080p30 for extended periods at high bitrates. From what I understand, this is a hardware problem with the card. So basically, it's not actually a 1080p30 capable card. 

It can accept a 1080p60 source and scale it down without using CPU resources though, which is my personal draw to it. Using it for these lower resolutions (e.g. 720p60) avoids the audio sync issue.

I can answer questions for anyone about this card if needed."

Max_Insanity,gaming,1388622582.0,"There were so many ways, most involving using grenades, mines and the like to throw them into an abyss, drive over them with a vehicle or land on them with a plane. It was weird, that they wouldn't fight each other, though. Imagine Vader just running past Yoda so both can kill each others soldiers."
admiralranga,AskMen,1388622583.0,"If you have the time/money to fail the class you should be able to appeal against your grades and if another lecturer  goes over your work and sees nothing changes in that up but your grades go to shit your teacher would be in hot water. Also try talking to your student union etc. 

EDIT assumed you were a uni student. Not sure how applicable this would be, tho I think my HS had an appeals process. Much bigger deal if you fail the class I suspect tho "

Omega037,relationships,1388622595.0,"First, cut off all contact.  It may be hard, but obviously staying in contact isn't working.  

People can't ""still be friends"" afterwards if you still have strong feelings with him or want to date him again.

Second, you aren't in love with him, you are in love with what you wish he was.  After all, even if you could make him get back with you, why would you want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you?"

CobraCommanderVII,changemyview,1388622601.0,"I think I was being a little too extreme there. I think the cutoff really should be if the fetus can survive outside it's mother. If it can't, it's not a person, it has no rights. And honestly, most abortions happen very early on in pregnancy. I don't think you're going to find anyone who's 8 months in and is just now deciding to get an abortion."

jezusbagels,casualiama,1388622609.0,"What were you born as? Have you had any surgery to help make you look how you feel?
How does your family feel about your lifestyle?
Are you attracted to both genders or are you into similarly non-binary folk?
Can you tell a little bit about your experience trying to be each gender and what it was that you liked/disliked about each that eventually led you to who/what you are today?

Also, bonus question for piquing my curiosity: Grammatically speaking, when someone is talking about you but not using your name (questions within a question: what is your first name if you don't mind saying? have you ever had it changed?) what pronouns do you prefer be used? (ie, he, she, it, them, etc)"
