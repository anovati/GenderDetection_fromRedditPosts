AbsoluteRunner,Games,1389410681.0,"Yes I have. It was for an MMO, Maplestory and Spiral Knight.

I feel Ok about some of them. For Maplestory I bought Pets/pet accessories and Cubes. Pets are good for picking up items which makes the overall experience much more enjoyable. Cubes however not so much. They are basically a gamble to improve stats on your equipment, Somes times they increase, some times they degree.

 While I'm ok with the Pets and the Cubes to some extent. The existence of them has Drawn the developers/investors to make content that only a few people can enjoy because of the MASSIVE INCrease in damage cubes can bring. (I'm taking literally 50x the damage of someone the same level.) 

As for spiral knights, their whole bunesis model is a money shame. So while The game is fun, The money scam was too obvious for me to stick around, (after I payed my dues…) for those of who are wondering. They have this energy system that is used to access levels and to upgrade equipment. Well you can only play for a solid hour before running out of energy but have they monthly passes that let u bypass that. And they also let you buy energy. 


So for me Im ok with micro transactions being both cosmetic and game changing stuff. But for the game changers you need to know when to stop and know your balance. 

What I think would be good balance is that the cash items only let you do things faster,in which normally isn't insanely long. Cash items do not allow you access to content that unpaying customers can't. Even if its harder for them, But again hard=/= impossible. 

While this only speaks for FTP I feel like the same Ruleset should be used if you payed an upfront cost for a game.

cunctatrix,AskWomen,1389410685.0,"Hmm. I broke up with my last SO for a variety of reasons, but a major factor was that it seemed like our relationship was holding both of us back from achieving our academic and career goals... it's weird because, yes, we probably could have been better about balancing our lives and our relationships, but that wasn't because we didn't want to achieve all these things.

If I thought a guy could go further in his career but he didn't want to? That'd be a much different situation. It's important to me that someone I am with be ambitious, that they have dreams and goals, but that doesn't have to manifest in career ambitions. I have a lot of sympathy for people who don't want to climb the ladder past a certain point. It doesn't really have to have anything to do with intelligence or talent. Personally, I'm fairly smart and gifted, but there are just certain things I do not like doing. I am not a people person - I will never be the kind of person to relish wheeling and dealing, schmoozing clients, all of that and that's okay. If an SO of mine loved their current job but didn't want to do the sorts of things in positions further up - even though they could get the positions - that would be totally fine with me. If they didn't have any dreams or ambitions at all, including outside of work? I couldn't be with someone like that.

As far as the money thing goes... I'd almost prefer to be the primary breadwinner, but I'm not going to dump someone for making more than I do... it's just money."

One of her friends begged her not to do it, that she would regret giving away pieces of him. i watched her apologize to fans, sit down and talk about how sorry she was that he was gone like she was directly responsible for it. I have never seen someone grieve that way and I was wondering what your thoughts on her reaction to it were. It was like she was apologizing to everyone else when she didnt have too. I always assumed (i was 6 when he died but i became a fan later in life and have a few books about/by him) that the media crucified her as this evil genius who latched onto him for money and recognition and when he killed himself, she felt like maybe she was solely to blame and giving away his things was like making up for what everyone thought she was.

Here's my answer from that thread: 




&gt;**No.** Not every female friend is attractive and even then it's not a rule of thumb. I haven't thought about a female friend while masturbating since my late teens/very early 20s. Some men will use the thought of every attractive female they know as spank bank material. Some men will only jerk it to the image of attractive female friends who have bikini pictures on Facebook/Instagram. Others will only do so if they have a crush on that particular person.

Evlwolf,newtothenavy,1389410940.0,"I'd go with Sprint or Tmobile. I had Sprint from the time I got out of boot until December. Their service was pretty good, but it really depends on the base. I was at NAS Pensacola. It was fine. I was at NAS Lemoore, and it was absolutely terrible. And then Sprint was fine when I was at NAS Whidbey Island and the surrounding Western Washington area (there are a couple other bases down south and coverage was good in those towns too).

I now have Tmobile (slightly cheaper than Sprint), and their service isn't perfect, but I almost always have basic phone signal, if not data. That wasn't always true with Sprint. If I didn't have data, I usually didn't have phone signal either. 

It really does depend on location more than anything. Some places are better than others with different carriers. 

One thing to note about the wifi is that the Navy contracts with GoWifi (the same company that provides airplane wifi) for the barracks wifi (and Navy Lodge and Navy Gateway usually contract with Sprint). GoWifi is an abomination as far as internet goes. Its speeds are already slow as shit, and add a shitton of sailors trying to use the internet at the same time? Fuck using the internet on a weeknight after school/work. When I was in school, I had to pay $35 a month for an upgraded plan just to be able to make *youtube* usable. Forget netflix. I honestly recommend that if you're going to be in a barracks for more than a couple months, you go with an actual internet provider with *your own* router (which you are allowed to do). I also recommend this because most barracks are built like fucking bunkers, so cell signal can be slim to none, no matter what carrier you have (benefit of Tmobile is you have the ability to make phone calls over wifi)."

ruta_skadi,AskWomen,1389410951.0,"This is the kind of thinking on it that drives me nuts. Literally no one I know has begun a relationship because a stranger approached them on the street. Where on earth do people get the idea that this is the only way to meet someone? Nearly everyone meets their SO through mutual friends, school, work, hobbies, volunteering, or online dating, not just a cold approach out of nowhere. If they met a stranger and started dating them it was probably at, say, a bar which is a *social* setting. Two strangers talking on the sidewalk is really not at all what I would call ""mingling"". Mingling is when you chat with people at a *social* setting like a party. 

If anything, I feel like cold approach to a stranger is a terrible way to meet people just for the low success rate, even if I didn't personally hate it so much. By definition you know nothing about that person. You don't know if they are single, if they're into dudes, if they're open to a relationship at all, if they are comfortable dating strangers, etc. Maybe she is poly and you are monogamous, maybe she has kid and that's a dealbreaker for you, etc. Those alone rule out a ton of women. Then I don't feel like selecting two people at random gives you very high odds of having a compatible personality. I mean the majority of people I know are not people I would date so what are the odds that this stranger is someone I'd want to date? And before anyone says something about missing opportunities, *not everyone is looking to meet someone*. And what, am I just going to try to date all the guys I see that are around my age and cute *just in case* we're a great match? That's just not how it works, and would make dating my full-time job. 

Also, this is extraordinarily frustrating: 

&gt; If you aren't interested then tell them so. It's not that hard.

Not wanting to be approached by strangers has nothing to do with being ""uptight"". It's because me leaving my house, which is a necessary thing for a human to do, is not an invitation to get hit on. Me going grocery shopping isn't a sign that I'm open for business. I should be able to ride the bus without having to fend off approaches. And it shouldn't *be* my job to go around having to reject a bunch of dudes just because I left the house. It *sucks* to reject people, is that really such a crazy idea? When a stranger approaches me they a) interrupt what I was doing when all I wanted to do was to get some shit done, b) make me feel awkward and uncomfortable and put me on the spot, c) waste my time because now I have to let them give their little spiel and wait for a moment I can say ""no"" because if I don't want to be mean to them and just yell ""NOT INTERESTED!"" and run away, d) leave me open to harassment after my rejection. It's really not uncommon for dudes in this situation to refuse to take no for an answer, to try to argue with the woman about why she should say yes, to get pissed and yell insults, or to become physically threatening. Even when a guy *doesn't* end up doing any of those things I am still worried about that possibility so that's yet another thing that sucks about the experience. 

Not everyone likes making small talk with strangers even outside of being hit on. For example, there are some people that always like to chat with the person next to them on the plane but there are a lot of people that would really rather not. Some people like to ham it up and make lame jokes to cashiers when they check out, but most people don't. 

If two people meet this way, great for them. But I'm not wrong or ""uptight"" for having differences on this than you do. "

ProffieThrowaway,todayilearned,1389411138.0,"I hate it when schools advertise these courses to the point that they draw media attention. 

Using popular media to draw student attention and keep it for difficult course material doesn't dumb down the curriculum (administrators asking us to flat out pass more students does that, as does standardization to lower course outcomes). In fact, this is one very good, pedagogically sound way to keep students interested and enrolled.

Case in point: I designed and teach a class on digital writing. ""Traditionally"" (as much as a course type that is 15 years old at the most can be) these classes involve reading new media philosophy and developing things for the web and using Flash and maybe some programming. 

My students program robots to learn about animatronic animation, are designing augmented reality writing for a local museum, write the text for a video game, and have to write three papers about the theory tied to these things. I advertise the class with things like: YAY! You'll get to use Google Glass! That's good for your resume! and pictures of Derpy from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (you can download a Flash puppet of her to animate the projects with). 

The reality is that the theoretical concepts we study are harder than the tech stuff we do--especially animating Derpy--but I would never ever get students to sign up and take the class seriously with those. Instead, students just don't read and stare at you when you try to lead discussion. Bring in the video games and the ponies though and it's fun--they have something they enjoy to connect course material to. 

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly--teachers like having fun too. If connecting difficult to understand philosophical concepts to South Park makes the class more fun for the teacher, the students will probably understand it better! Plus the teacher will have fun so they will be fully enthusiastic about teaching a course they have probably taught 10 or 20 or 30 times before. "

rising_son,Guitar,1389411157.0,"I started dabbling in it recently. One thing I would suggest is if you are going to do a video with lots of your own talking in it you should script it in advance and work out what you are going to say. A friend of mine did some of his own videos a while ago and they were very incoherent as he did not script what he was going to say in advance. If you do this it will stop you going ""umm and ehhh"" while you think of what to say. I did a kind of ""video lesson"" for a lick and I kind of drafted out what I was going to say beforehand. I think it's best to be yourself, and not try to fake any personality. The trouble with reviewing products is that in the beginning you will have to actually buy them yourself unless you are good friends with someone who owns/works at a guitar store to let you film stuff with their store products in the store.

I would say in terms of gear reviews, be concise in what you are saying. For example if you were demo'ing a pedal, open with a quick intro, say a few things about the pedal and get down to some sounds of what it can do. I see waaaaaaaaay too many videos of guys talking for 2-3 minutes at the start of a review. My ideal review format would be: opening sentence introducing the product (what its called, who makes it) and show it on the screen, then a brief summary of what the pedal does, what controls it has, then describe quickly what you using it with (guitar, amp) and start to demonstrate the tones. End with a conclusion about what you think of the pedal.

I think overall being clear and concise with what you are saying is very important. Also make it personal, show your face on the camera, smile and generally be outgoing so that you are appealing. There is a guy on youtube called Rob Chapman (sometimes called ""chappers"") who is a pretty big name. He has done everything from lessons, to gear reviews. He is not that impressive as a guitar player but he enjoys success because he is funny, friendly and appealing. It's worth checking him out.

Make your videos sound good, and by this I mean get a decent microphone for recording your guitar sound with, and also for your speech. Personally I get IMMEDIATELY put off videos with poor sound quality, especially if it is a gear video. I use an AKG condenser for my Amp and a Blue Snowball for recording my voice. The Blue Snowball is a decent affordable microphone.

In terms of ""being embarassed"" as you said, this should not be a problem as if anything goes awry in your video recording you can just reshoot, or edit out ""bloopers"" etc. If you just be yourself you have nothing to be embarrassed about!"

When it comes to sports, the issue is complicated ayup. A pre-everything transwoman would probably destroy all the ciswomen at most sports with ease due to the much heavier muscle tone caused by their testosterone levels being at least 5 times higher. Under these circumstances, I would think that yes, it would be unfair to allow pre-everything transwomen compete in women's only sports. Yes, of course, society is completely and utterly significantly less fair to transwomen than ciswomen (speaking from experience), but you don't combat unfairness with unfairness like this; two wrongs don't make a right.

On Estradiol alone, a transwoman's testosterone levels will fall significantly - on Estradot Estradiol Hemihydrate 150ug/24 hrs alone, my serum testosterone levels shrank from 14 nmol/L to 4.5 nmol/L - still above the female range, but way below the male range. I was then put on a GnRH agonist called Triptorelin Acetate, a form of Androgen Suppressant, in order to bring me solidly within female range (it's now hovering around the 1 nmol/L mark, which is *below* most ciswomen). After not much time at all, I found I tired easier, and found carrying things significantly more difficult, and my workout regiments had to shrink to accomodate this. On average, appropriate HRT causes transwomen to lose up to 50% of their muscle mass, and become weak even by ciswomen standards; it's one of the reasons why our bodies look more female than male, because all the muscle tone vanishes, and this is one of the defining characteristics of masculine body shapes.

It doesn't even end here. Sex Reassignment Surgery (""The Op"") includes Orchidectomy, which is the removal of the testicles. The testicles are the producers of testosterone in the body, and without them, you get the baseline female rate of serum testosterone. Post-operative transwomen do not need androgen suppressants because the default levels of testosterone are akin to being female (estrogen supplements are required for life, though, due to the lack of ovaries).

**In conclusion**: As a result of these facts, I think it unfair to prohibit post-op and pre-op-but-on-HRT transwomen from women's sports, given we're pretty much analogous to ciswomen, but I do accept that pre-op-and-pre-HRT transwomen should be prohibited in the name of fairness from women's sports."

Tanky utility items typically... Mana boots, Drums, Mek... Blademail is nice because he tends to get up close and personal for the aura.  Soul ring can help with harassment in lane.  Strength, mana, auras, armor are all good.

With lots of farm, Shiva's, AC, BKB, etc.

In team fight, stand near who the carry is attacking -- ET's aura is bananas and will vastly increase carry's damage.  Look for opportunity to drop ulti to catch multiple enemies.  Spirit and stomp whoever your team isn't focusing.

I can speak from experience and say that a mud wash would be a really bad choice on this. It would ruin the chrome effect. On the armor, at least. The loincloth seems to have a bit of shading done, But it's hard to tell from the picture. A mud wash could do it some good. 

If you did *any* washing to the armor, which I wouldn't, if you want to keep the chrome effect, Go for an oil wash. a dark blue would be a good choice, As it would accent the glow effect of the eyes and wires and junk around the head.

The *only* complaint people have against reposts is that OP gets karma for something someone else got karma for. Often, these are the same people who will say they don't care about karma when their comments in other threads are downvoted.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389412413.0,"&gt;they're still taking the easy route.

And this is absolutely subjective, as I don't think it's the easy route at all.  I'd hate to have to be on that end.

&gt;Yes, I think it's incredibly easy to be the one who gets asked out because that means you get to play the more passive role.

Yeah, and that would be all fine and dandy if you were guaranteed to get asked out, but you aren't.  At least in the active role, if you want a date and you ask around enough, you'll get one.  Otherwise, you're just hoping, and if no one asks, you feel worthless.  Let's say you want a new job - do you *just* post your qualifications to LinkedIn, or do you actually apply for jobs?  I mean, I don't mind posting to LinkedIn, but the rest of my time is spent applying pretty heavily for jobs. I don't want to wait around.  If they want to, that's their choice, but it's less effective.  Yeah, you never have to get turned down for a job, but who says someone is going to hire you?

&gt;safe face because you never made your point clear.

Save face from asking someone out?  I'm not trying to attack you, but are you in high school by chance?  Because in college this was pretty much irrelevant, and after that, even less important.  No one cares.  There's no need to save face because asking people out isn't really that big of a deal.

&gt;It was implied that both, being rejected clearly and after asking directly and having a hint ignored, are equally bad. 

Hint?  We're talking flirting here, an indicator of being attracted to the other person.  Sure, there are some ambiguous instances, but it's usually pretty clear, and if you aren't sure, it's pretty easy to say the right things/ask the right questions to get your answers.  

&gt;No, she doesn't. Making it clear would mean clearly stating her interest.

Honestly, I think you either need to grow up or join us in the real world.  Yes, sometimes flirting isn't entirely clear, but usually, it's pretty obvious.  Maybe if you don't have experience or if you're insecure it's hard to decipher at times, but otherwise, it's really not all that difficult.  There are some pretty clear signs that don't tend to happen unless the girl is actually interested. 

&gt;Both parties have specific jobs because women like her force men to take on their job because she refuses to do that part. 

I'm not even bothering with this anymore, I don't think I can get through to you.

&gt;so turning it around now and listing it as an effort women put forth in dating doesn't exactly seem honest to me.

Again, completely missing the point.  I never said it was an effort put forth in dating, I said it was pressure from society.  Stop putting words in my mouth.

&gt; It's still the guys who has to muster up the courage to do the asking, who has to face the rejection, who has to deal with it and who has to not let it affect him.

Have you ever asked a girl out?  It's not that bad. People make a big fuss about it, then they actually do it, and you ask how it was - ""yeah, it was fine, no big deal really.""  The problem is people psych themselves out up until the point of asking, stressing themselves out for no reason at all.  Then they ask, and realize it wasn't scary at all. 

&gt; Personally, I know a few guys who I'm quite sure feel like that

Okay, please read what I said:

Watertor,AskReddit,1389412486.0,"I had a Theology professor my second semester of Freshman year. She was ok, in that in person she wouldn't say anything about her prejudice(s).

I did all the work for the most part - though sometimes I skimmed a reading or two, because it was... not very educational, to say the least (we read a book about how some lady obtained Christianity, in which she went through several other religions and countless drugs to get there) but I still do the majority of what she asked, and in discussions I followed perfectly what we talked about.

Come test time, she asks very open ended questions. She literally said on one question ""Elaborate what *YOU* think is the reason for this"" in reference to something about God (I don't remember exact details as she didn't let us see the test questions outside of the test). I'm happy because I'm a natural writer and I do my best to answer the question but give me own personal spin on it.

Well, she didn't like that at all, and so she literally just wrote in RED FUCKING INK ""Wrong, no support for your answers. Didn't read the material"" and gave me a 26%. Did I mention that was my midterm? We had no tests until the midterm, and that was what she graded my test as.

""Well maybe you were wrong?"" well, that's a bullshit reason as I answered the questions she gave our groups fine. I answered questions she herself gave fine. Just the moment I gave my own spin in private to her, I suddenly am dead wrong? That's fishy.

But that's not the only issue; she emails me saying my test scores were... lackluster, and I wholeheartedly agree (I was much more confused and panic-mode back when this was just happening) so we set up a time for me to retake the test. I retake the test, and I use much less of my personal voice, but simply try to support EVERYTHING I say with examples of the book.

A month and a half later, it's a week until finals. I go to her office during her office hours (hours where she says she'll be in her office unless stated otherwise, for those who don't know) and I ask her where my make up score is, to which she looks up, says ""Oh I lost it"" and looks back down to her keyboard. After a few confused questions that basically boil down to ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" she spits out ""You can retake it again if you want. It's kinda late in the semester though, so I probably won't have time to grade it""

So, I gave up and got a D in the class thanks to my never missing a class and thus always turning in the group work we had to do (to which she would have to give everyone in that group a zero and not just me).

She cost me my scholarship and I'm barely scraping my GPA up to get it back. I will forever hate her for causing my mom to cry as I told her I lost it and my college future was in the air."

&gt; I, too, soon got accustomed to the deadly missiles,—in fact, I had already started to make observations of their peculiarities. My ear, accustomed to differentiate sounds of all kinds, had some time ago, while we still advanced, noted a remarkable discrepancy in the peculiar whine produced by the different shells in their rapid flight through the air as they passed over our heads, some sounding shrill, with a rising tendency, and the others rather dull, with a falling cadence. A short observation revealed the fact that the passing of a dull-sounding shell was invariably preceded by a flash from one of our own cannon in the rear on the hill, which conclusively proved it to be an Austrian shell. It must be understood that as we were advancing between the positions of the Austrian and Russian artillery, both kinds of shells were passing over our heads. As we advanced the difference between shrill and dull shell grew less and less perceptible, until I could hardly tell them apart. Upon nearing the hill the difference increased again more and more until on the hill itself it was very marked. After our trench was finished I crawled to the top of the hill until I could make out the flash of the Russian guns on the opposite heights and by timing flash and actual passing of the shell, found to my astonishment that now the Russian missiles had become dull, while on the other hand, the shrill shell was invariably heralded by a flash from one of our guns, now far in the rear. What had happened was this: Every shell describes in its course a parabolic line, with the first half of the curve ascending and the second one descending. Apparently in the first half of its curve, that is, its course while ascending, the shell produced a dull whine accompanied by a falling cadence, which changes to a rising shrill as soon as the acme has been reached and the curve points downward again. The acme for both kinds of shells naturally was exactly the half distance between the Russian and Austrian artillery and this was the point where I had noticed that the difference was the least marked. A few days later, in talking over my observation with an artillery officer, I was told the fact was known that the shells sounded different going up than when coming down, but this knowledge was not used for practical purposes. When I told him that I could actually determine by the sound the exact place where a shell coming from the opposing batteries was reaching its acme, he thought that this would be of great value in a case where the position of the opposing battery was hidden and thus could be located. He apparently spoke to his commander about me, for a few days later I was sent on a reconnoitering tour, with the object of marking on the map the exact spot where I thought the hostile shells were reaching their acme, and it was later on reported to me that I had succeeded in giving to our batteries the almost exact range of the Russian guns. I have gone into this matter at some length, because it is the only instance where my musical ear was of value during my service."

Yes, workers gain utility from leisure and lose it through labor. But if we go by the assumption that the substitution effect dominates the income effect (the supply curve of labor is upward-sloping), then workers will rather work to earn more money than not work to get more leisure. In other words, workers get more utility with a larger income than with a larger amount of free time."

If you're under investigation, here's what happens:

1. Your kids get hurt, you don't document it as an accident. You're abusive, you lose your kids.
2. You're grumpy because the football team lost. The kids say ""My dad was angry today"" because they don't know ""grumpy"" and don't know what the cause was. You're abusive, you lose your kids.
3. You need to move away to get a new job, the job's out of state. You're fleeing investigation, therefore you're guilty, you lose your kids.
4. The CPS worker suspects something's up, no physical evidence but it's the lack of evidence that's tipping off a gut feeling. You're hiding something, **you lose your kids** until they can get proof.

To go by your analogy, yes, it's the fault of the person who calls the SWAT team in the first place. However, that doesn't excuse the police for flashbanging a 5 year old, tazering a kid and beating the father unconscious because someone said he ""might"" have a bomb and he didn't get his hands up fast enough."

I had my hand over my mouth but I couldn't stop how much it caught me off guard. I laughed. Vocally. EVERYONE turned their heads and stared at me with ""Are you serious?"" looks. I put my head down and then tried to play it off as laughing from a previous joke the teammate next to me had said.

dbaker102194,AskReddit,1389413367.0,"I was hit as a kid whenever I did something wrong. Mom would yell, and dad would hit me. Basically how it went. Never hit me more than once(per fuck up).

But I can't really say I've started my adult life. I'm a pretty average college student. Have terrible luck with the ladies (I always pick the ones that will cheat on me.) But aside from that, my life is pretty fucking fantastic. 

I wouldn't hit/spank my kids just because. But some kids just don't give a shit about a verbal reprimand. You ever seen the little shits running around in Walmart with their parents god knows where? If my kids were ever that poorly behaved, and verbal punishment didn't work, then yes I would probably spank/hit them, strictly in the form of discipline. "

I think your fiend was probably more concerned with hydrogen diffusion in the weld, which the higher heat input from helium helps to control better by keeping the weld pool molten longer allowing more of the hydrogen to escape.

If you had oxides on your aluminum (which is likely with GMAW) you could assume that the escaping hydrogen might mix with the oxides, but I don't think it would be as big of a concern as the hydrogen staying in the weld."

Said anything about being entitled to sex?

&gt;I only listed those two individuals to point out that having a lot of sexual partners is not new.

No one ever stated, or made an argument for having a lot sexual partners being new. 

&gt;Some people seem to think the Red Pill is some revolutionary method that enables men to have a lot of partners

Technically, It is. Your counter argument as to why it's not is a mass murdering rapist conquerer, and the most famous rock star of all time....

I'm not sure how you don't understand what a bad argument that is... 

&gt;Any woman can research the Red Pill theory to know what to look for.

Attraction isn't a choice. Lots of women know what The Seduction Community is, and it still works. There are many posts in /r/Seduction written by women. Hell, go read /r/GoneWildStories and it's basically a shrine to TRP.

&gt;It's not some sort of secret society. I can read about their strategies. And when I see someone trying one of those strategies with me, I walk away. Honestly, they are not nearly as ""smooth"" as they think they are.

TRP isn't about being smooth...I don't think you know what TRP actually teaches...I think you just think it's a Seddit under a new name...

&gt;How is it hypocritical? I don't believe that some lives are more valuable than others. 

We've been over this like 100 times. You **do** believe in social value. Everyone believes in social value. If you're unwilling to date a 400lbs man with no job and terrible hygiene, you believe in social value. 

Would you date a 400lbs man with no job and terrible hygiene? No? Congrats! You believe in social value :D!

&gt;I think you will find most people, attractive or otherwise, reject the theory of social value.

If logic and reason had an ad populum bias, the Earth would still be round, and the Gravity would be magic.

&gt;That doesn't matter. If someone would be willing to let me live with them rent free, that's their decision. I would never accept it though, I don't use my appearance to get free things.

Yes you do, you just don't admit it consciously. ""Wow..johnny from accounting was so nice to me today. He's doesn't treat anyone else this way, but wow...he's s0o0o nice. What a nice guy johnny from accounting is...derp"". 

&gt;I've been hired by heterosexual women before, they didn't hire me just to impress me. 

Being hired by heterosexual women doesn't disprove my point....it's been proven that everyone responds better to attractive people. 

&gt;What type of special treatment do you think I get for being attractive?

I already said. Everything in your life is drastically more positive than the life of anyone else. I work with a very very attractive women, and people are very aware she is treated far better than other people because she's a very good looking woman. Me and another guy were explaining to our other female coworker that people bend over backwards to not offend her, hurt her feelings, be nice to her. She's probably faced 1/10th the hardship in her life as anyone else simply because she won a genetic lottery. When she walks in a room, everyone is thinking ""what can I say or do to please her"".

Peach was actually Bowser's girlfriend all along, and prior to the events of the game, Mario had stolen her away before Bowser successfully rescued her back. So over the course of the game, the player is guiding Mario through his quest to kidnap the princess a second time. This is why there are hordes of enemies - Bowser placed them as defenses to try and prevent Mario from getting to Peach again.   

The reason Mario doesn't seem so evil is because, due to repeated brain trauma from using his head to break bricks, he's gone completely insane and is living out a delusion where he is the good guy, Peach is in love with him, and Bowser is pure evil (when in reality, he's just super pissed at Mario because he keeps trying to kidnap Peach).

Can you pose a hypothetical that does not demonstrate ignorance?  Would it be fair to assume that, at least occasionally, someone is simply using it as a tool to encourage someone to look at something from another perspective?

Let's explore this for a moment then:  

Why are you ""supposed to"" be born with a foreskin?  

&gt;  no one is supposed to be born with a cleft lip, club foot, and 12 fingers, and if someone is shame on the obviously related parents.

That's a low blow, dude.  Are you now implying that children are only born with birth defects as a result of incest?  If so, that's a pretty ""despicable opinion"" in its own right.  If you're just out to and troll and draw the ire of people who do not understand your philosophy, then that's your thing I guess.   

Have you considered the possibility that the absolute intolerance of someone else's viewpoint is, in and of itself, an act of ignorance or bigotry?  

I can understand and empathize with your viewpoint, even though I do not agree completely.  I can clearly see where it can be positively applied to certain situations.   Can you see how, for some people, it would be a nearly unconscious ""alright, sure"" when the doc asked if they wanted to have their child circumcised?

So that means you'd have to be in the 96% of a .1% group. The odds of you being in that category, not so great for you.

I am fine with people being able to speak whatever they wish, as long as they are willing to take the heat (whether legal or societal) for stating something that may completely destroy someone's livelihood and or their bigoted remarks towards certain groups (the LBGT community for example.)

For example if I were to repeatedly harass someone to the point that they considered suicide a viable option, then I believe that is worthy of legal consequences. If I were to say that gay people shouldn't get married or are committing an act against God, this is punishable by societal consequences of losing all my friends and potential family members. You can say whatever you like, but when it comes down to the point of negatively affecting a person and or persons, then there should be consequences, if that makes things any clearer. There are of course potential exemptions where it is a he said she said situation, but generally speaking, actions have consequences, that's my belief when it comes to free speech does not mean lack of consequence."

SirNuke,linux_gaming,1389414961.0,"If you want to dig into this, you'll actually probably want to write [a winelib DLL](http://www.winehq.org/docs/winelib-guide/bindlls#BINDLLS-INTRO).  This allows you to write native Windows code that interfaces with UNIX APIs and runs under WINE.  There's definitely going to be some pain due to Valve's use of C++, and Bourne Stroustrup infinite wisdom in how C++ does symbols and whatnot.  The WINE's spec stuff is probably all but useless here, as there's no traditional Win32-style API calls in Valve's headers.

I'm thinking about starting a git project to work on this.  The first step is probably creating a simple recreation of how the Steam client works from an API perspective: a Linux executable that responds to virtual function calls similar to in style to the Steam API, then create a Winelib DLL that glues the WINE-&gt;Linux environment (to sort out any symbol/packing/etc issues).  After that is implementing enough of the Steam community APIs for basic apps to work, and work your way up from there.

Admittedly, maybe it's the alcohol and rusty-ness with C/C++, but I'm not 100% sure how virtual function calls work across libraries in this case.  I feel like I'm missing a step, perhaps one clarified by the full Steamworks documentation.

UPDATE: [OpenSteamworks will probably be a useful resource](http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=824685).  Definitely need a 'proxy' between WINE and Linux Steam, in the form of steamclient.dll/steamclient64.dll.  Can't help to think this would take a half hour total if it was done in a straight C API, but oh well.  I'm done poking at this for tonight.

EDIT: I feel like I should mention that a hypothetical WINE -&gt; Linux Steam steamclient.dll implementation may or may not cause a VAC ban.  I'm not sure 'where' VAC runs on a Linux/WINE scenario.  Most VAC games are Valve properties that have native Linux ports, however a binary mismatch due to the WINE -&gt; Linux Steam steamclient.dll will probably get you VAC troubles if you play on VAC enabled games/servers."

frolickingotter,nonprofit,1389415033.0,"We're a relatively new (2012) nonprofit, but we've been operating as a not-for-profit since 2009. The TL;DR of what we are is a community space, geared towards a particular demographic. My role is essentially general manager/facility manager/ bookkeeper/ do-er of many things. Seriously. I've even dabbled in some of the coding for our website, and I have very little background in that. Believe it or not, I am not a founder, and didn't get involved until 2.5 years ago. (I am, however, their first and longest lasting employee.) Anyways, on to answering your question.

* Categorizing money spent. Since providing the space is kinda our ""big thing"" as it were, this sometimes can make doing bookkeeping tricky. Does it count as doing work towards the mission? Probably, but it sure would be nice if the people holding the main purse strings would feel it necessary to spend the money to discuss this with a lawyer.
* We are primarily funded by monthly membership dues. Finding the balancing line between giving the members benefits, but also making sure we don't detract from the public's ""experience"" as it were, has been one HELL of a roller coaster. There is some serious growing that needs to be done, and some lines that just need to be drawn and stuck by IMHO.

As far as software goes, here's a quick rundown. Let me know if you want specifics on anything- more than happy to help:

* Quickbooks: To send out invoices, and track corporate donors.
* Outright: We technically could use Quickbooks to categorize money spent, but after spending several hours on both, I personall much, much prefer Outright for basic income/expense categorizing.
* PB Works: I'm  not sure what the technical word for this is (again, I don't do the programming, not my background, etc.), but this is how we go in and edit/ create our website. Like some people use WordPress, we use this. I enjoy it, but I'm no guru on this so take that with the appropriate grain of salt.
* WePay: Currently what we use for our merchandise selling online, and what we've used for selling tickets to events and fundraisers. Honestly, it's not as good as what it used to be and I'm interested in finding another platform. But it is fairly intuitive to use, so there's that.
* Square: Just good to have around, take in money on the fly. You can create a pretty decent online shop with that too.
Spreedly/ Pin Payments: For taking in monthly subscriptions for our membership.

Aaand.... I think that's it off the top of my head. Hope some of this is remotely useful! Remember, all non-profits are different though, so what works, what our pains are, etc. are probably going to be wildly different from others'."

And I've grown a pretty evolved BS detector and in most games I rarely suspect people. In this game though, considering how many people I see in killcams randomly tracking me through walls before killing me, I have to wonder. Seriously. To be fair, a lot of it IS lag tho. I know half the time I don't even have a chance at getting kills because i get 1 shotted from my perspective and crap. That I can't blame on people as that is what you get when you put the game on crappy matchmaking instead of giving us dedicated servers. But when I see people apparently tracking me through walls? You bet I'll call BS.

&gt;“I like people with property. I am not at all enthusiastic about the rootless fellow in an apartment house, with a social security number as his main distinction. I loathe the capitalism that concentrates property in the hands of a few, no less than socialism which wants to transfer it to that great nobody, the hydra with a million heads and no soul, Society. I like people with their own abode, their own field, their own views prompting them to independent action…I hold that state, business, manufacture are the great slaveholders of our times. John Doe works like his spiritual ancestor, the medieval serf, one and a half days a week for his landlord. Of four weekly checks he hands over at least one to the corporation which rents him his habitat. Failure to do so would result in dispossession, a menace unknown to the villein of the thirteenth century. In the factory he slaves, unlike the guildsman, for unknown investors as well as for corrupt labor leaders, if not, as in the USSR, for a combination leviathan of State and Society. The workers should own the tools of production; there is no earthly reason why they should not own the factories in a literal sense or be the holders of all shares distributed after a certain key. A plant could be a living community no less so than the medieval workshop.”"

2) Do some sort of faux ""backsplash"" on the wall above the stove.  Maybe even just hanging tiny pictures.

3) Look into some colored barstools and more colorful placemats on the breakfast bar.

4) Anywhere you can stick something functional and colorful:  a pretty mixing bowl, or a pretty pitcher with flowers or utensils, canisters, etc, works well in a kitchen.  We have colorful state map dish towels and a painted pot rack on our wall, as well as a cute cookbook stand.

My recommendation was for OP to build 60 card Highlander decks (no Commander, none of the EDH rules) to play against the lower-powered decks in the playgroup.

Orelle,infj,1389415906.0,"I agree. But I think expression of empathy can also be learnt situationally. Perhaps not authentically or without awkwardness, particularly for those who are private, but as a valued device. Children are told, ""put yourself in their shoes,"" and I've heard it suggested that one is mentally ill or delayed if they are unable to do so relationally — addressing this as a cultural issue. Sympathy may be genuine, even more honest when experiences are disparate, but done inadequately it may be seen as superficial (a valid but somewhat selfish concern depending on the context), a lesser form of empathy, and I think it can be an isolating factor for the listener and/or the listenee. Where sympathy is viewed negatively, as pity, it may be avoided or feared an imposition. 

There is a connection, but in a way, empathy is inclusive and sympathy rather exclusive. Sympathy can be one-sided where empathy gives; in a way, it may be a tendency but also I'd say it's a call, and I'd argue both are projections. Empathy may be less of a listener but also less of an island. Sympathy is more direct but also more of a spectator. Likewise, I'd guess that having a tendency to be sympathetic is the lonelier and stranger of the two roads. 

The usefulness of either depends on the floor, so to speak, and if the injured party wants to take or yield it, if they may feel ""alone"" or if they desire individual attention — if they seek attention at all. (Example: embarrassment.) With awareness of cues comes choices. The longer we live, the more genuine empathy we stand to gain, and I'd be curious how that alone affects how we choose to articulate 'feeling' connections.

I am loving that they're not the biggest and baddest, they're just getting started, the phase pistols are brand new, they don't have any shields, they're barely getting to warp 5, and they're making a bunch of mistakes with first contact with other species, and they're only have an alliance with the Vulcan, they don't even know if they can have children together.

You want to be able to play any character you want, so do I, but at the same time, how does creating some sort of framework for what your character was pre-zombies take away, and not add to, the realism of an ordinary person with a normal life and ordinary skills stuck in a zombie-infested wasteland?

What do you think the Devs could do, to provide tolls you need to play a varied character types, beyond some sort of mechanical separation of characters, what could they implement that will make you even a little different from all the other people running around the world?

The first said he claimed me first, and the second said he had a bigger dick. They went back and forth for a while, and some others joined the chatroom and got involved as well. Keep in mind, I haven't said anything after my first post. There were all kinds of internet tough guy statements flying around. It was basically like those nature documentaries you see on Discovery Channel where all of the male animals are fighting over the female animal, and their method of domination was to see who could be the loudest. I left the chat and rejoined on an alt account a minute later. Nobody noticed I had left. They were still going at it. I was laughing pretty hard, but later I felt really bad for any woman who would happen to come in contact with any of these primates. I wish I would've stayed to see how long they would have argued, or to see if anyone noticed I had left.

&gt;LMAOOO youre a fucking idiot. yes. im sure non-japanese people bought a shirt that says 'Hentai' on it (which is based on a shirt that says ""pervert"") from a site that is decorated with hentai because of this ostensible other meaning of the word. the mental gymnastics you do to justify your idiocy is astounding

I guarantee you none of them bought the t-shirt because of its associations with hentai or anime. They bought it because it seemed edgy, the same reason people buy Comme Des Fuckdown hats and FUCK-printed Supreme garments.."

Taulon,CrusaderKings,1389416708.0,"One of the largest factors is the number of holdings that the county has in it. A county with just a castle is much less profitable than one with extra baronies, especially cities. City vassals make you a ton of money, which is why building extra city holdings is extremely profitable. You can usually make the investment back within one ruler's lifetime is you have high taxes on cities.

Upgrading your holdings is nice and all, but it's really more like a drop in an ocean. Worse than a drop in the ocean really, because not only is the amount of extra income miniscule, but it takes so long to just break even with the investment, much less turn a profit."

Your source is ""Free Domain Radio"" which is a self proclaimed **philosophy** podcast. I hope I don't need to explain why philosophy and empiricism readily conflict. 

FDR's source is the ACE institute. Which is a small research institute currently run by two doctors, which used to be run by three doctors until one of them was forced to resign after a scandal involving his tampering with test results became public. 

Not only that, but the ACE institute HAS NOT FINISHED THEIR STUDY REGARDING THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CHILDHOOD **TRAUMA**. Trauma. Not spankings. That would be things like car crashes or near death experiences. Also, **the study isn't even done yet.** 

Basically what happened here is the biased FDR took an incomplete study and made it sound factual, despite the fact that they really stretched the definitions of some words, and were going off of a study that isn't even done.

Dantilli,socialskills,1389416746.0,"Just ask her out, the worst that could happen is she says no, but she DID ask for your number so just go for it.

My top tips would be 

1. To make sure she knows that you're asking her on a DATE and not just to go hang out as friends. I've seen a few people make that mistake and the result is an embarrasing mess most of the time.

2. Do NOT go to a movie on a first date (or within the first 3 dates ideally) unless you are both really, REALLY excited about seeing it. A date without talking is completely pointless and you'll both end up feeling disappointed afterwards. My suggestion would be to ask her to do something that you would normally enjoy and do yourself anyway (no, not playing computer games, don't be silly). It helps her enjoy herself if you're already enjoying yourself and if the date doesn't work out, you're already doing something fun.

3. The fact that she recently broke up with her boyfriend is not a problem. If it is, she'll tell you."

If a game needs a tutorial (i.e., because the mechanics are very complex, a la Crusader Kings or Ai Wars), I really want a proper tutorial that I can work through at my own pace and refer back to when necessary. 

Trying to hide the fact that the player is in a tutorial leads to two *terrible* results, if the game is hard to learn: Either the player is thrown in blindly and has no idea what they're doing because the game developer is afraid to walk them through it, *or* they are forced to sit through an unskippable tutorial that they can't ever refer back to without starting a new game and which they can't avoid if they *do* already know how to play.

Also, mushroom dishes are delicious - Look for dishes that end with ""Pilz(en)"" or ""Champignons"" - they won't be in season, but you could find some restaurants that used dried mushrooms if they're your thing.

Also, Berlin has some terrific Italian restaurants - there are a few around Bergmannstrasse that are particularly good (and that's a fun area of town too!)

Finally - turkish places do wonderful quick veggie meals - and if you've got a minute can whip up some killer thin-crust pizza for €3-4. Döner can be made vegetarian too with feta instead of meat, and a lot of places in Berlin specialize in Gemüsedöner (veggie Döner), which adds fried root veggies along with the cabbage, onions, tomatoes and sauce - really good and cheap for a take-along lunch. Mustafa's is famous for their's (also near Bergmannstrasse).

As far as general resources are concerned, I'd recommend looking into the [Hawaiʻinuiākea School of Hawaiian Knowledge at UH Mānoa](http://manoa.hawaii.edu/hshk/) and the [Bishop Museum](http://www.bishopmuseum.org/) which should both have a lot of resources about Hawaiian history and culture as well as potentially support for genealogy projects and similar. It might be better on-island to visit, but I think both have some online resources or at least contact info for people who can point you in the right direction. Also, consider utilizing your local interlibrary loan systems for books and resources that aren't available in your area. 

One book that can provide one take on an important part of Hawaiʻi's history is [Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen](http://www.amazon.com/Hawaiis-Story-Queen-Liliuokalani/dp/0935180850) written by Queen Liliʻuokalani after her overthrow. It's not the only perspective for sure, but I think it's a good introduction to a lot of other major historical events and figures, especially if you're willing to read it with a bunch of google tabs open in another page XD

Trollshaws gives you a bigger level range, but I didn't care too much for the quests there in the first place, and it involves a LOT of back and forth foot travel with little in the way of stable-masters, and even less swift travel.

Evendim is fairly linear in the sense that you get directed from quest hub to quest hub (Oatbarton to the glass-blowers to High King's Crossing, etc.).  The faction reputation is not too hard to max out, and although the last area, Annuminas is very hard for solo at-level, you can always come back later, when the epic quest brings you back.  Also, the scenery is very pretty, lots of cool old ruins and Arnorian statues, and I really like the soundtrack."

Few years ago I lost 80~ pounds going from 360 down to 275~. Diet and exercise. Eating properly, not 1-2 large meals a day or fast food. As stated I'm in the neighborhood of 375 again, mostly due to depression and previously having a job that required me to drive 3,000+ miles every month to month and a half.

But COD is normally a rather competent game. It's good at what it does.

The problem with ghosts, is it failed completely at the execution. It finally develops a new next gen engine where we finally get decent performance, but then it completely sucks in implementation. Seriously, if you're gonna bring high level hardware to its knees, you better give me the best darn visuals I've ever seen. If you're gonna run worse than crysis 3, then I hope you at least LOOK like Crysis 3. Ghosts, at best, looks like Crysis 1/warhead. Maybe not even that. 

And then there's the lag. Seriously....why the hate for dedicated servers? 

And the hackers...why are hackers a thing? I mean, how come treyarch games don't have 1/10 the hackers of the IW MW games? 

And just...ugh. Mouse acceleration makes it impossible to aim properly...I feel like vsync is on, even when it isn't. With my 2400 DPI mouse, I am a pretty good shot in every other game...including previous CODs. But in Ghosts, my character acts as if it were drunk or something. 

MW3 had lag/hacker issues too. BO1 had bad optimization, but runs great compared to ghosts. 

It's just....ugh. Really, it's not hard to make a good COD game. Even if the formula becomes repetitive as heck, if the games are good, I'll still buy because don't fix what aint broken...instead, IW just breaks crap and then expects it to sell...that will be COD's big downfall."

Nausved,gamedev,1389417981.0,"That seems like the easier approach to me. Depending on your modeling software, removing faces is as simple as selecting two edge loops and collapsing them—or, in more difficult cases, cutting off certain details (like, say, the ridges and ravines in the human ear) and replacing it with flat planes. But *adding* details is quite a bit more involved; in the easiest scenario, you insert an edge loop, maybe round it off a bit, and then have to tweak the edge loop piecemeal to match the silhouette you're going for. In areas of more complex detail (like around the face), you may well find yourself deleting large patches and re-creating details from the ground up.

Not to mention, modeling in high-poly first can provide you with the normal maps to make your low-poly model look like its high-poly version.

That's my take, anyway. I'm certainly no expert."

red_one2012,MakeupAddiction,1389418030.0,"Regarding the lip liner question, it can be necessary depending on what look you're going for or what product you're using. 

For instance, I almost always wear lip liner because I have a really thin upper lip and can make it appear more full by using liner. I can also use liner to outline and then fill in the entire lip, followed by my lipstick. The liner helps to keep the lipstick from feathering and can also make it more matte/long lasting. 

Finally, a liner can be your best friend when using a dark lipstick because it will be more apparent if you have any less than perfect edges.

a1blank,arduino,1389418277.0,"I used to manage an observatory with a 16"" scope that used stepper motor setup to move the telescope. Here's what you need to do (these will be general concepts). 

You'll need a way to orient your telescope directly toward celestial north which, depending on how sensitive you need, could be considered to be magnetic north. You also need to be able to adjust your scope in both the RA (right ascension) direction and the dec (declination) direction. These measurements are based on the [equatorial coordinate system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_coordinate_system).  Right ascension is the measurement that deals with the earth's rotation.  You really won't even need to be able to read your settings on your scope as long as you orient it towards north and you are able to find the object you want to track.  From there, you should just need to set a precise stepper motor to move the telescope a tiny bit every couple parts of a second (depending on how much you want to mitigate blur).  I think this might be called a fixed-rate right ascension drive.

If you need better tracking, you'll probably have to investigate ccd-based tracking setups and those get expensive.

Other thoughts: You should be able to achieve the effects of a precise stepper with a large gear ratio such as one achieved with a worm gear (you'll want this to be pretty tight so as to prevent slippage when weight shifts onto or off of the motor).

Edit: you might find [this](http://stargazerslounge.com/topic/66141-diy-tracking-drive/) thread useful.  I'm going to keep poking around and see if I can find anything that might be useful as a guide.

Edit: [This](http://davetrott.com/inventions/double-arm-barn-door-drive/) might also prove useful if you're doing barn door tracking specifically.  [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/1jk0h5/equipment_homebuilt_tracking_mount_up_and_running/) is /u/0x05's original post about his mount, so you might be able to glean some information from that."

I read ""Journals"" too.  I know his idea of this unknown stomach disease that causes random bouts of severe pain in the abdomen.

whoseworldisit,nba,1389418527.0,"There's no reason to break it down by distance when you can look at synergy and see it broken down for pick and roll, transition, iso, what have you. You can look at the numbers yourself:

[LeBron:](http://i.imgur.com/F8MZN8Y.png)

[Durant:](http://i.imgur.com/inyfR0d.png)

As you can see, in almost every category, Durant's shooting foul rate is as close to James' as to make no difference. The observations align with what one would expect when you consider their playing styles. LeBron handles the ball a lot and gets calls more often in isolation and pick and roll plays. Durant is more of a jump shooting threat and gets more calls off screens, in spot ups and hand offs. Coaches will tell their players never to go under a screen on Durant, whereas if LeBron settles for a jump shot you can live with it. 

Really, the only area where Durant has a huge margin over LeBron is in transition plays. Again, if you know anything about their play styles this makes sense. LeBron is extremely hard to stop in the open court, and is pretty good at finishing through contact. Players don't want to foul him in transition because of the and 1 risk. With Durant, even though he's a 90% free throw shooter you still want him to earn it at the line instead of just letting him lay it up. "

Cast irons are meant to last a long time and give tea a purer taste. If someone were to want to pass the teapot on to someone else, say a grand child, it wouldn't be too appealing if the teapot made green tea taste like a chocolate rooibos or something.

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1389418853.0,"I used to go for drives, but my parents quickly put an end to that because it was their cars and they didn't care if I was paying for the gas. I could kind of agree with that. I would just take my brain out and point the car in a direction and go. But the cars are old and constantly falling apart so I don't really blame them. It's been a while since I've gone on a nice drive. 

I do wrap myself up with the internet pretty much, Reddit mostly. (GASP! SHOCKER!)

However, before my long period of unemployment (3 of some of the most agonizing years of my life) I would work a lot. When I was in high school I at one point was a busser for a Chinese restaurant, had two babysitting jobs, going to school, and helping out at a flower shop. Granted they were all on call, it kept me busy. Then I graduated high school and was unemployed for the longest time - bouncing from odd job to odd job. 

However, I don't work nearly as much as I want to. I finally found two jobs, but had to quit one so I could be home to take care of my disabled mother. I used to cycle too, but now I don't have money for a bicycle or the time between what little work I have and my mother. 

Now I just bottle everything up. Reddit helps, a little. I can complain on here sometimes, help get some of my problems out -but I am only able to hide in my room for a little bit. 

It's hard when you';re going to be 22, not really able to have your own car, not really allowed to have a drink. Very very rarely do I have pot, but again, too expensive and not really able to.

The actual number if dead people that society as a whole eventually has to deal with remains unchanged. What I'm saying is that it's no more expensive for you and I (clean-up / sickness wise) if they die of heroine vs every other cause of death. 

And yes, to an extent your arguments about alcohol play in to the idea of legalizing other drugs, too (with heroine as possibly the most extreme example). If we trust people not to hurt others while they're drinking enough to say ""you can drink as much as you want legally with some restrictions"" then what is it that stops us from legalizing ""heroine"" or any other drug? They're both addictive. They both damage society. What's the difference?

Well, for one thing if you're high on h you're not going to drive a car. For another you know far more people who use alcohol recreationally without addiction. On the other hand, how many h users do you know? Alcohol use is accepted because, to put it bluntly, it is acceptable. Not because it's safe. Not because it doesn't ruin lives. Just because the people in charge of making laws (by which I mean both MOCs and you and I) also do it. We proved that prohibition doesn't work in the 20s. Why must we continue to support it? I don't do heroine (tangential argument) but I see no reason why if *you* wanted to do h in the comfort of your own home you shouldn't be allowed to. "

I'm just interested in finding a gym I can afford to go to so I can finally start working out again. I was a member of a 24 hour gym, but it was way too small for the price. I was paying around $50/mo, they only had 2 showers/restrooms, a mini-fridge in the corner with 4 water bottles, a small box of protein bars, and Gatorade - they had 6 treadmills with cable and like 5 shelves for people to put their stuff. That was pretty much it. It was tiny as hell. Like, as big as one and a half living rooms in an average double wide trailer. Maybe. And it was in a shopping mall. *Not* worth $50 a month. PF seems like it might be better but after reading stuff here, I feel like it's not. $10-20 is about all I can afford a month when I work PT delivering pizza and have $400/mo in medical bills plus helping my mom pay bills now that my dad has passed.

CartManJon,AskReddit,1389419377.0,"Working the backroom of a big-box retailer, I needed to get a TV out of the back for a customer. We had a pallet of 5 of this model of TV on the top of the warehouse shelving. Customer was in a hurry and nobody else was available to get it down. I am not certified to drive the forklift but thought ""fuck it, I will get it"" and began to get the pallet of TV's down from the top.

Well I put the forks too high up and smashed them into the front of the first TV on the pallet. The three on the backside fell off the top of the stockroom shelves to the floor and smashed. The one I hit with the fork had a big hole in the box and the screen. One TV survivied.

I got drug tested, passed, and so got put on final warning for operating equipment that I was not certified on."

It's a chance you take when you put yourself out there.  It's the same chance the females who date you put out there, too.  And *chances are* they are experiencing the same anxiety.

If you feel anything start to get serious, be upfront about these things and expectations.  If she's a decent human being, she'll lay her cards out on the table, too.

Now that you're on campus, your school control the routers that need to pass those ports to your machine when he tries to connect to your IP address. The campus probably locks most of the doors and windows.

Did this work before you went home for the holidays? Your school probably has a help desk that might be able to help you out, but even they are going to be limited to what they can do to help.

As solutions go: you can take the server world files you have and send them to him and he can host the server with the same world you guys used (if he's at home or lives off campus where he has his own internet).

My understanding is all the medications you speak of are of less strength than the methods which were available to me in my teens and twenties, so I would have thought things were different now. In talking with younger girlfriends, it seems not so much.

I took the pill around 4 years before my first child. The type was Ortho Novum 28 day. After the pregnancy, the pills made me feel vaguely ill. I experienced the same nausea I'd felt during my very early pregnancy. Trials of three other brands made no difference. Same nausea.

I've spoken to three younger friends who've experienced the same in the last five years. As with myself, there are also many women who tell me they never experienced anything like this. I do think the pregnancy is the key, and had I just gone off and on without any pregnancy it wouldn't have happened.

Other than this, which seems the most important to me, my cramps returned actually fairly quickly over perhaps three months. As the doctor had warned me, my ovarian cysts, which I was told were the cause of a lot of my pain and which I believe to be correct, returned without the pill. 

I didn't loose or gain weight either when I went on or when I left the pill the first time. When I returned to it, slow gain. A lot of women who said they had no slight nausea when they returned to the pill also said they had weight gain issues. Some had had them on first use, some had not. Some of it may have been age as most of us had taken them in college and were returning after we were in our adult lives and less active.

PainShake,magicTCG,1389420119.0,"I play Bird Tribal in every format I can.  While I'm sitting out of Standard right now (too little time to keep up), I had an absolutely hilarious build in the Alara-Zendikar Standard. The list in its final incarnation is [here.](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bant-birds-bite-back/)

It all started when I pulled a [Flurry of Wings](http://magiccards.info/arb/en/127.html) in a pack and decided to build my FNM deck around it. (I had just recently gotten back into Magic, and it reminded me of all my favorite Bird Soldiers from when I started in Odyssey).  Various experiments led to the list I linked, a very fragile deck that could turn games around in a single turn, or win as early as turn 4.

For perspectives sake, this was a budget deck (I spent $24 total) in a format where both [Baneslayer](http://magiccards.info/m11/en/7.html) and [JtMS](http://magiccards.info/wwk/en/31.html) were legal and commonly played. I was mainboarding 4 [Sage Owls.](http://magiccards.info/m10/en/69.html) 

Those [Sage Owls](http://magiccards.info/m10/en/69.html) really got to people.  It inspired much laughter and derision when it came down on Turn 2 (or 3, the deck had lots of lands that came in tapped).  I was the one laughing when 3 turns later my Owl was hitting for 6 with help from [Coat of Arms](http://magiccards.info/m10/en/207.html).

Many would-be lethal alpha strikes were narrowly stopped by a [Flurry of Wings](http://magiccards.info/arb/en/127.html) (A card so often overlooked that few opponents remembered it existed). And of course, following a Flurry with a lethal [Coat of Arms](http://magiccards.info/m10/en/207.html) or [Sigil Blessing](http://magiccards.info/ddg/en/30.html) charged backswing from nowhere left them stunned.

It wasn't a great deck. It lacked strong removal, and got crushed by board wipes and a lot of targeted removal.  (Perspective: [Lightning Bolt](http://magiccards.info/m10/en/146.html), [Path to Exile](http://magiccards.info/mma/en/25.html), [Day of Judgement](http://magiccards.info/zen/en/9.html) and [Terminate](http://magiccards.info/arb/en/46.html) were also all Standard legal).  But it was a fun deck.  It was tons of fun to play, and very fun to play against, especially since our FNM was clogged with Jund, Jund, and more Jund. The list even came dangerously close to top 8 on many occasions in very competitive meta.  It was the best time I've ever had playing Standard, and I strive to make all of my ""competitive"" decks hit that same perfect peak on all three pillars of my ""Will I Play it?"" scale, pasted below for your convenience.

1. Does it have a bunch of Birds?
2. Is it fun to play?
3. Does it not lose every match?

I haven't been able to keep up with this Standard, which is a shame.
Mostly because there are 3 different 1-drop Birds in Standard right now (name them all for bonus points!), and there could be more coming in the next two sets.

Apparently I wrote an essay for this response.  Neat.
tl;dr  I played Bird tribal in Alara-Zendikar Standard, it was totally dope."

SibcyRoad,funny,1389420288.0,"I loath any HOA. Where my parents live, the rules include no pools, no flag poles, no boats parked in driveways and no clothes lines. 

Alright. Fine. But when they *pick and choose* who gets to follow those rules and who doesn't, that's when it's a problem.  There are members of the HOA with pools. The guy across the street has a flag pole. Why? Well he's some kind of blow hard pseudo cop or something. 

But what really bugs me is the money they ask everyone for every year. And each year that price increases.  Don't pay the money? Have fun being nitpicked about every landscaping move. 

So this year they asked for $200 for ""repairing the sign"" at the entrance of the neighborhood. There are 50 something houses in our subdivision. That's a lot of money.  My parents asked for a breakdown of how the money would be spent. Back and forth emails with the least amount of information from the HOA possible finally pissed my parents of enough to demand a line by line break down of each projected penny spent. They sent a very trite email with the explanations, as if they were doing some sort of monumental favor that was asking entirely too much. 

Why were they demanding? Because the HOA wanted to sink most of the funds into a glaring spotlight, and copper fixtures. Copper, which has been systematically stolen from several surrounding properties, would not exactly be worth the investment. 

My parents brought that up and refused to pay a dime. "

This just isn't true for a lot of people. My SO used to work 9 am to midnight 7 days a week. Every second of free time he had was spent sleeping. And he doesn't even have a family to take care of. Many, many people have families and kids, and have to work two or more jobs. I can't even imagine how they find time to clean the house, do laundry, and spend time with their families, much less spend three (consecutive -- that's important) hours cooking, and another hour doing dishes, plus the time to plan out meals and shop.

I'm not saying that it isn't important to try to eat well. It definitely is. But it's really easy to oversimplify things if you've never been in that kind of situation. If there was a satisfying healthy option that was just as fast, easy, cheap, and accessible as fast food, I'm sure many people would absolutely start eating that instead."

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,InteriorDesign,1389420400.0,"I really like your house. It has a distinctive style that isn't overwhelming. It's fun, has some amazing pieces, and definitely feels like a home. I would want to spend time in those rooms. 

Nitpicks:
 Most of the art is way too small for their placements. The one lone piece across from the niche by the door, the abstract one over the armoire in the dining room, the one small clock in the kitchen, even the guest room paint by numbers looks so dwarfed compared the wall its on. Try finding larger pieces for those spaces, and then group the small ones you have to fill the space.

Do you use the clocks? If not, I would suggest taking most of them and grouping them all on one wall, like the kitchen wall or the dining room (and switch the bird sculpture into the kitchen). Again, many of them are too small where they are and are getting lost. By making a group you highlight a beautiful collection and fill up space in a balanced way.

Tchotchkes. I love what you have, they are just too cluttered on each surface so they are getting lost. The fireplace mantel should have the sunburst and then maybe just the animal statues. The dining room armoire needs to be pared down. One idea would be to use the china cabinet not just to show the awesome place settings, but also the pottery and candlesticks mixed up in it. More like a china bookcase type feel. You could also [tack/tape up a printed paper to the back of the china cabinet](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/00/54/c8/0054c8e7df39a9a122a3562116dd3a01.jpg) to bring some pattern into the dining room. A lighter background would soften the largeness of the cabinet and would pop the plates. 

None of your candlesticks have candles in them! Go get a box of long thin white tapers and put them in. You don't have to light them, but they will add height and drama. 

Finally, think about switching out the two chairs by the fireplace for one of you other eames loungers. There may not be room for it, but I'm wondering if having the couch and two matching eames chairs might not make a cleaner look instead of 3 mismatching chairs. 

This is long, so it probably comes off very negative. I swear, I love your house! Just thought I would throw out some ideas. Also, I love that you have blankets in almost every room. I'm a blanket person and it made every room feel super cozy. All together a really beautiful home. "

What does entitlement have to do with that...? Men want sex. Women don't want to have sex with them. Men found a way to get sex from said women. 

&gt;I will admit, it was a shitty argument. But you got my point.

No, I didn't, because the argument didn't make sense. 

&gt;You are right that it isn't a choice. I don't read /r/GoneWildStories, I'll have to look into it to see what it's all about. My point is, I'm not attracted to people with the mindset of TRP. And even if I were, I would NEVER go out with someone like that.

Almost everyone agrees with TRP if you present the information in a diplomatic fashion. People disagree with TRP because they produce the information in a combative manner. 

If I said, ""people pretty generally only show sexual interest to those who meet their standards, and women tend to have high standards, being strong, confident men, because they can get sex whenever they want"", far fewer individuals would disagree.

Second, you haven't demonstrated how it's misogynist.

Third, you haven't demonstrated why seduction without emotion is a negative quality. People do it all the time. That's what clubs and nightlife are for. 

&gt;No, I don't believe in social value. I can value someone, and not be attracted to them.

Maybe, but you value someone you're attracted to more. There you go. Social value. 

&gt; I would not be attracted to that guy, but I would still care about him as a person, and I might be friends with him if he's nice.

Oh yea. That's nice of you. How many ugly, fat, and jobless friends do you currently have, hmmm?

&gt;And you are forgetting the downside to being attractive

There is no downside. 

&gt;People always discredit your accomplishments. Some people, especially men, don't think I'm very intellectual when they first meet me. Some men don't want to approach me. Others shout vile things at me on the street. Some women are rude to me, especially if they are with a boyfriend or husband.

Boo fucking hoo for you. 

That's like life handing you a free Ferrari and complaining because it's paint is midnight black and you wanted it to be sunfire yellow. You won the most powerful privilege in the world and you're complaining because people are rude to you and some men are afraid of talking to you...?

The embalmer was prepping someone and told me to go get the casket so we could put them in once they're dressed.  I so to the store room and get the casket on a cart.  It's a $5,000 steel casket with brass fittings.  I wheel it I to the embalming room and open the lid to arrange the pillow and the lining.  When I do that the balance shifts and the whole cart tips over and crashes into a big bronze crucifix denting the top of the casket and scratching the shit out of the finish.

I had no idea what to do.  The embalmer helps me get it back on the cart and tells me to go get the one from the showroom.  Thank Jeebus we had the exact same casket in the showroom!  We get the deceased into the casket and set up the room for the viewing.  When we're done with that the owner calls me in to his office and I'm sure I'm done but he just tells me that ""everyone does that once, but only once.""

With a sample size as large as 700+ possessions, it's a pretty safe bet. 

&gt; I've followed KD closely since he's entered the league and over the last few seasons, I feel like he's been getting more favorable/undeserved calls than any other player and many agree. 

People agree because they don't like Durant and remember the 1 superstar call more than the 9 he earned. I see a lot of Heat fans who are insecure about Durant being close to as good as LeBron and will find any way to devalue his stats. This shit's been going on for decades; my uncle used to say the same thing about Jordan being pampered by the refs. Or my cousins who complained that Kobe got calls Paul Pierce never would.

Like, amid all the talk of trying to find new fuel sources, the obvious truth escapes us which is that every conceivable substance is a potential fuel source. But like, metaphorically. For life. So...all the things become potential sources of intrigue, all the weaknesses become strengths, all the problems become opportunities, all the insignificant details become important clues. Well maybe not all of them. This one's still pretty vague, still chewing on this one.

Workability, the situation is workable. There's always something to work with, always PLENTY to work with. I carried around this logical/dogmatic rule of thumb for the longest time that any given shitty situation seems 66% more shitty than it actually is.

Honestly, I despise myself. I know that I hide it well, either being positive or neutral. I'm well known for being calm, fairly confident, and quite man humorous. 

I don't see many women being attracted to me, to be honest.

Exactly two women have been irrefutably attracted to me. 

One had a family that was to religious. I'm very pro-gay rights and they were very pro-chic fil a and traditional all that shit. Admittedly, she wasn't but she had a violent temper that made us incompatible for being in a relationship. 

The other almost totally took me off guard. I could only guess because she was friendly with me beyond necessity. That ""nice"" guy stuff isn't exclusive to men. I liked her, but she was younger than me(and looked it, which made me feel uncomfortable at the time), and I didn't want to hurt the other girls feelings(they liked me at the same time).

The other times I have *thought* women were attracted to me, I've found out sooner or later that they act that way around men they're either comfortable with or are casual friends with. I am positive there was no romantic or sexual interest. 

Going back to my original point, I despise myself. I see no reason to ask anyone out, and my misery is unlikely to be mitigated by the multitude of rejections. 

So, instead I work on trying to improve myself. Ease the pain. Enter uni, and I'll think about it then. "

terabyte06,NoStupidQuestions,1389421344.0,"My opinion:

Microsoft managed to capture the PC market share back in the 80s because they offered a cheaper product that was good enough.  They bolstered that with the release of Windows 3.x and Office.

Since then, they've maintained the business market share by offering granular control of company computers through Active Directory, etc.  Apple hasn't made much move into this market.

In the smartphone race, Blackberry came first, then Windows Mobile, then Apple.  I think Blackberry beat out Microsoft because it performed better for business users, which smartphones were originally targeted at.

Apple came around and changed that with the iPhone, targeted at consumers.  

It wasn't until about 3 years later that Microsoft released a true competitor to the iPhone with Windows Phone 7, at which time it was already too late.  Android had popped up as well, and taken a considerable portion of the consumer market.  

Since these new devices are heavily app-driven, and app development is heavily driven by market share, Apple and Android apps are far and beyond what Windows apps are.  I think this was a large driver behind the development of Windows 8 and the Surface tablet.  They're enticing app developers for Windows Phone by expanding the market to include Windows 8 desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.  

Anyway, I'm a sysadmin, a PC user (Win8.1), an Android user (currently).  I've owned the iPhone 4S, Moto Droid, iPhone 3G, Blackberry Pearl, Samsung Blackjack (WinMo5).  So take from this what you will."

Some questions for you:

- How much alteration was needed to adapt the WH40K universe to the FATE system? Is FATE very flexible in that sense? (It ook a look at your rules section, and I got the sense that you did quite a bit of work, if not re-wording).

- How much detail do you plan in your campaigns from session to session? That is, do you write very detailed back stories for every major NPC? Minor NPC? Do you typically have a good idea which NPCs will be important when the session begins?

- What tools (software or otherwise) do you use to manage your plots and/or NPC relationships?

- Have you ever had a situation where two PCs came into direct conflict with each other in such a way that a GM veto wouldn't make sense from a narrative perspective? If so, how did you resolve the conflict without animosity developing between the players themselves?

However, I would like to point out that lowering launch costs by an order of magnitude (or two) is an absolutely critical step towards SpaceX's ultimate goal of going to Mars.  With launch costs even half as expensive as they currently are, a Mars colony is not economically viable.  Musk has mentioned on a number of occasions that he does not think people will colonize Mars en masse unless the cost per person is ~$500,000. 

That means that SpaceX still has a *long* way to go before it would make sense to pump a ton of money into R&amp;D for a Mars mission specifically, because it would all go to waste if nobody is able to overcome the crucial first step of drastically lowering launch costs.  Fortunately, the technology that SpaceX is currently focused on will be useful should they ever send people to Mars; the Falcon Heavy increases the amount of mass that can be sent to Mars in one trip, the Raptor methalox engine makes Martian ISRU possible, SuperDracos might be the key to solving that tricky Mars EDL problem, etc."

Toby-one,fatlogic,1389421655.0,"A) No. No one is refused lifesaving surgery just because they're fat however if you want to go through **elective** surgery then we feel that you should probably do a certain number of things to decrease your risk of complications during and after surgery. Please cite studies because I know of none. Blogs don't count.

B) Possibly but that is pretty much true about anything that deviates from what the doctor is used to. One reason for increased risk of dying from a gunshot wound in my country is because in the worst areas we only get 1 or 2 gunshot wounds per year. The really big risk group when it comes to doctors and nurses not knowing how to give the correct care is when old people end up in the emergency room. Because the people working there have lite experience and not enough time to care for older people which means that for every minute that an elderly patient spends on the ER instead of at the proper ward increases their risks of complications. Like good healthcare practitioners we have taken steps do decrease this risk by creating special ER teams for the elderly. We have lots of studies of how fat bodies work that is why we know that being obese increases your chances of dying during/after surgery and it leads to longer recovery time and more complications.

I want to point out that not every fatty is like this person. I know patients who have been diagnosed with early type 2 diabetes and have changed their eating and exercise habits and dropped excess weight like crazy but I have also met assholes like this guy. People who think that the only way to lose their extra kilos is by stapling their stomachs so when we get them an appointment with a surgeon and the surgeons tells them that they need to lose a few kilos before he feels comfortable operating then it's obviously the surgeons fault that this person loses his foot to diabetes...

More in oppression news we also don't operate unless you stop smoking first because smoking and/or fat really mess up your chances on the operating table and extend your recovery time significantly.

Gertiel,raisedbynarcissists,1389421829.0,"I just realized how lucky I am my spouse saw all the crazy first hand early on. At the time, I was just so humiliated and embarrassed. It was awful, but I never have to worry about him suggesting any contact with my nMom especially. In fact, he's told me if I were to insist on any significant amount of contact, he'd be sad. Sad because he'd be forced to divorce me since he knows he could not put up with that level of bullshit in his life.

For me, it is only since I have been trying to be NC that I have really realized the cost of each interaction with my nMom. I guess when something is a constant presence, you just don't notice it as much partly. When I had a lot of contact with her, I was just in such a constant state of agitation and unease. There was always something she was manipulating and pushing me to turn my concern toward. Now, on the few occasions I have dealt with her, I am amazed how I could have stood her anywhere near me all those years. The moment she opens her mouth, the lies and the crazy just spill right out. 

Recently, my nMom turned up at the hospital while I was visiting a family member. I knew she'd been by earlier and therefore was a little under-prepared thinking happily that I had missed her. My enDad is nearing 70 and still works a full schedule. nMom was bragging even whilst receiving treatment for his cancer, he never missed any work. This includes several surgeries. He apparently handled phone calls and emails even on the very days of his surgeries. All I heard was poor dad can't even retire because you spend it faster than he makes it. 

At the moment, I am 46 going on 17. I suppose that sounds a bit silly. I suspect some of the reasons, though I can never be sure. My nMom especially manipulated to ensure I didn't do any of the important things I really wanted to back in the years between 17 and 22. I am not talking of wholly juvenile pursuits such as boozing and partying. I am talking of those things which I wanted to do to learn about the world and develop my independence. Now I am busy planning ways to enjoy those things which were most important to me and missed in those years. I view it as parenting myself to be what I was meant to be.

Of course, I find it a lot more fun to make Ork weapons from scratch, seeing as how they're usually ramshackled and improvised instruments anyways. No two shootas will be exactly alike, and BIGGA BOYZ TAKE DA BIGGA SHOOTAZ.

To do this, I start with a human weapon that the Ork weapon will be based on (such as an autogun). I give it a slight damage buff, either by increasing the +N damage modifier, or by increasing its semi and full-auto rate of fire. You know, for **MOAR DAKKA**.

I slap on the Unreliable Quality, and give it some other kind of quirk, like a big BLINKEE RED LITE, an improvised bayonet, or a handle wrapped in duct-tape to make it EKSTRA GRIPPY.

And even though we were a D-III school we were for some reason ranked most fit campus by Men's Health Magazine, so basically there were plenty of attractive guys. Plus with parties around campus and the best bars in town being within 2-3 blocks, we walked everywhere and everyone you knew lived within a few blocks from you.

I'd recommend going for something within your budget that has a good picture, and buy a warranty. I've seen samsung, philips, panasonic, polaroid, sanyo, and emerson TVs all fail with the same problem, they use an under powered or cheaply made power supply that fails due to overheating or bad capacitors. $150-$300 repair at a shop. I have noticed Sony and LG tend to be more reliable, I've only repaired one Sony and it was 8 years old when it failed. 

Aside from that I'd look for something with a game mode, some TVs have a lot of post processing that you can't turn off and it causes input lag which really sucks for FPS and guitar hero. Another thing to consider is buying it at Costco, they have good prices and a really good return policy."

I run Soul Sisters in Modern and I've played Merfolk and I've found that Soul Sisters has better matchups in the meta than Merfolk does. Soul Sisters destroys Affinity, RDW, Twin (UR at least. It's very good against UWR too, just not *as* good), is 50/50 against Pod and Tron, and can beat Jund (but this is a VERY hard matchup). The deck is too fast for Living End most of the time, and can race Storm. Infect is hit or miss, but with enough dudes and a path, you can win. If you build your SB right, you should have answers to every deck that can beat you (though even post board, Jund is rough). 

Soul Sisters is perfectly fine in the meta, and many builds have done well in the past year. You can splash black or red and shore up any matchups you were having issues with, and those splashes involve getting staples (fetches, Bobs, helixes, etc depending on the splash).

Wuffles70,NewcastleUponTyne,1389422282.0,"I drop in on the fitness subreddits but honestly, yeah, me too. 

I was diagnosed with a heart condition last year and was on bedrest for 6 months, gained a fair amount of weight but lost way more muscle mass. As someone in my early 20s, I had never really experienced a loss of confidence in my body quite like it - more than once I burst into tears walking back from the shop with my SO after the bedrest because I was so exhausted and emotionally overwhelmed by how crumbled and weak my body felt. It took me a while to get up the motivation to exercise and even longer to find what worked for me but the first step was yoga.

I'd avoided it for ages because of all the new age BS that can get tacked on but it wasn't cardio so it didn't make me feel guilty for being out of breath, you improve really quite quickly at first and the focus on breathing and being present with yourself was really healthy for me. I had stopped being aware of my body and I hadn't realized that a large part of it was that I doubted its capabilities - making myself do it helped bring things into focus a bit more and help me slowly gain confidence in my body's ability to get better at what I wanted it to do. 

It didn't matter if I felt good or bad, yoga was non negotiable because it was as simple as rolling the mat out and getting on it (I know some people who even leave it unrolled in the hall and do a couple of stretches whenever they happen to be passing through!) and the emotional benefits have been recorded in quite a few studies investigating the physical and emotional effects. As I got more confident about being able to at least do yoga, other sports have followed on. I did a walking half marathon with a friend a few months back, am getting back into swimming (a big deal for me - I love it but I have body image issues so getting up the nerve to go back was a challenge), am doing a C25K with friends and am even considering taking up lifting. None of that would have happened if I hadn't started off with some more manageable chunks and, for me, that was yoga. 

If you're interested, I'd be happy to give you some info to help you get started - if it doesn't work for you, then I'm confident that something else will. We just have to find what that is. :)"

I play on a varsity level sport team, and I've become really close to my teammates which is pretty standard for all teams. I think this applies to club and intramural sports teams as well.

I also joined a fraternity, which I realize isn't the most popular suggestion here on Reddit. Only about 8% of my school is in Greek life, but between the 70 brothers in my house and the girls I've met at exchanges I have a good group of people to hang out with at any given time.

Lastly is something that anyone can do and I think is a great way for anyone who lives in dorm style housing to at least try once. Organize a trip, event, dinner, or some other type of activity open to anyone on your floor/in your building. For us we do a floor dinner any time someone has a birthday, and they are a lot of fun.

Acidpants220,AskMen,1389422692.0,"Girlfriend of mine had a bajillion cute things she did, but one of my favorites that made me really fall in love with her was the following:

The morning after I had stayed over one night I was getting ready to head to class, but she didn't have class for a few hours so she was laying about in bed mostly asleep.

I gave her a kiss on the cheek as I was leaving, and she responds by mumbling something inaudible and started walking down to the foot of the bed where the door was. She very suddenly leaps (read:flops) forward onto her stomach, and positions herself with her arm outstretched directly in my path with her pinkey out.

I grab her pinkey with mine and she opens her eyes briefly, smiles and says ""I love you."" and promptly falls back asleep. I'm pretty sure she doesn't ever remember doing it. I just melted inside. Took all my willpower not to snuggle back in bed with her.

We broke up a while back too, so who knows if I'll ever tell her about it!

The idea it just makes me sort of sick.”

At no point does she say that anyone has an obligation to be attracted to her, just that she is frustrated by the way that her artistic choices are being policed by people for no reason at all really, other than that there are certain people who don't find her attractive and are *really fucking vocal about it*.

So we started our own drama club (instead of the actual drama class) and put on skits and plays on our own. We always tried to have them the same night as the drama class' shit, but the teachers always ended up making us move it.

cassidymccormick,writing,1389422981.0,"There are two things that you need to remember here before you toss it in the black bin. Now I want you to listen very carefully, because these are very important points. Are you ready? Okay.

1. All writers will think their work is garbage somewhere along the writing process, even if it isn't. You've been staring at the same piece for a year now, you're bound to get overly critical of it. Imagine reading your favorite book over and over again every day for a year. By December you're going to be like, ""Atticus Finch is secretly a member of the KKK and this whole thing was a conspiracy! The grammar in this story is archaic! On page 132, line 47, word 6, there's an inaccurate representation of an old-fashioned coffee maker!"" (All just pulled-out-of-my-ass examples, of course.) But really, try not to sweat it right now. Wait until you're at least a bit more objective toward it.

2. It's a first draft. It's supposed to suck. Sure, a lot of people may disagree with me on this, but really, have you ever spoken to any writer who will say that their first draft was gold? Of course not, because then we wouldn't have drafts. Just keep working through it until you've gotten your story out and finished, then deal with the mess later. This is your creation, let it breath through you. You have months or even years to add all the other crap. 

My advice in reference to both those points? Like I said, power through it and get that first draft done, and then (this part is extremely important) TAKE A BREAK. If your start editing it off the bat, you're either going to be too attached, (""But the scene where they bump into each other while eating biscottis is crucially important to my character's inner conflict development!"") Or overly critical, (""THIS WHOLE THING FUCKING SUCKS! I CAN'T WRITE ANYTHING, I'M GOING TO BE A STRIPPER INSTEAD!"") You get the point. Take a month or two off. Breath. Sleep. Come back when you're a little less biased.

TL;DR: You're probably doing much better than you think you are. Just give yourself the time you need to make it the masterpiece it wants to be :) Happy writing!"

r0dlilje,MensRights,1389423096.0,"From my experience as a 23 year-old female, these attitudes seem a lot more common in older adults than young ones.  The following issue is that these older adults (plenty of older men share these views) have influence on younger generations.  While there's something to be said for who we spend our time with (and of course the fact that as a female I've never experienced such a situation first-hand) shifting our biases, I've encountered much more blatant role-determination and expectations from the 35+ (especially female) crowd than my younger counterparts.  My year spent in a nursing home was a real eye-opener to the archaic attitudes of much of the ""golden generation"" regarding gender roles.  Hopefully these attitudes continue to wane.  As a social worker it pains me to see the young men I work with struggling with fear about false accusations and simply asserting themselves and their boundaries.  It's even more frustrating when I have worked with colleagues who perpetuate these entitled and self-righteous views.

Interestingly, many of the older folks I worked with appeared to resent those roles they felt pressured to fill, yet passed those ideas on to their children.  Whether it was by example or ideology, these ideas definitely trickled down, and continue to do so."

jednorazowa,AskReddit,1389423127.0,"I am congenitally incapable of religious faith.  In other words, my brain doesn't bend that way.

I came to this realization when I was maybe 6 or 7 years old, taking catechism classes in preparation for my first communion, and the teachers placed a lot of emphasis on the importance of faith. I'd never heard of ""faith"" before, but obviously this was what I had to do to be a good girl.  So I tried to have faith.

And I couldn't.

I could be a good girl.  I could follow the rules.  I could say all the words to the prayers and sit and stand and kneel when they told us to.  But I just couldn't make faith happen.  There was nothing there to make it happen with. There wasn't even a hole or a void that I could fill with faith. I just didn't have that setting in my brain, like how there isn't a setting for tint on a black and white TV.

But the teachers were very emphatic about how important it was to have faith, so I started having dreams that I was going to hell.  Multiple times a week, I'd dream that I was falling and falling and it was getting hotter and hotter and I'd wake up screaming, but even that terror couldn't make me have the faith I believed I needed.

I mulled this over for years and years, and finally, around the age of 10, I realized I needed to stop going to church and going through the motions of being religious.  I figured that by going through the motions when I didn't believe, I was basically trying to trick God.  And I figured that God, being omnipotent, would know I was trying to trick him, and that he wouldn't be best pleased about some kid thinking she could trick him.  And I figured that not having faith *and* trying to trick God (and everyone else) is worse than not having faith but not trying to trick anyone.  So if going to hell was determined by absolute criteria, I'd be going to hell anyway, but if it was determined by relative criteria, I'd be reducing my chances of going to hell by no longer trying to trick God."

First off, we can't be talking about all animals, because a trivial counterexample would be social insects like ants/bees who live in matriarchies. So I naturally assumed, like you, that we're probably talking more specifically about primates.

Primates is a good start, but then the behaviour you describe suggests that beta males aren't completely denied reproduction and that alpha males play a role as well as any female in denying beta male reproduction. Even if that were true, it doesn't stop them.

So what you're saying goes along with my understanding. It's part of the reason why Chimpanzees are known to have unusually large testicles.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee#Anatomy_and_physiology

&gt; Chimpanzee testicles are unusually large for their body size, with a combined weight of about 4 oz (110 g) compared to a gorilla's 1 oz (28 g) or a human's 1.5 ounces (43 g). This relatively great size is generally attributed to sperm competition due to the *polyandrous nature of chimpanzee mating behavior*.[22]

Emphasis mine.

Also, incidences like Pimu's come to mind (an alpha male murdered by a gang of beta males from his community). It seems unusual but occurs when there aren't enough external threats to improve internal solidarity. This is why I was initially confused."
jms3r,tall,1389423547.0,"BMI is a crude value and is only a shaky indicator at best even for people within a small distance from the mean body type

BMI certainly does not apply to people outside the 95th percentile in height :P

look at body fat instead, it's harder to measure but it's a better indicator

or just be honest with yourself - do you have a healthy lifestyle, yes/no? cus that's what you are trying to find out isn't it?

I find people who feel they need to validate their ""yes"" with a BMI number should probably have answered ""no"" :p"

I am not sure about the bureaucracy of finding your records through the DOE or the school you attended, but I would really encourage you to be diligent and hound them for those records.  Along with this, I would see if you can build a relationship with a counselor or advisor at the school you are now enrolled in.  You need an informed adult advocate to help you get those records, as well as plan for scholarships, college applications, and possibly a way to take the PSATs independently or through another school.

Finally, if all of that doesn't play out, I would urge you to seek some real-life experience in the fields you're interested in.  An internship or an apprenticeship or volunteering somewhere or even a part time job relevant to what you want to study will give you unique real-world experience to use in your college applications."

They went after him. Never worked at all while we were together, but they didn't base it off what he actually makes. They based it off what an able bodied man of his age SHOULD be making. They ordered him to pay $215 a month. He got a job, and quit as soon as he got garnished. Makes his new wifey pay all their bills I guess. Last I checked he owed $2500. He has nothing for them to take, so it doesn't exactly help me, but they will take his drivers lisence, garnish wages/bank accounts, put a lien on any house/boat/car he owns if he has any of those things. If none of that works they will issue a warrant.

Gertiel,raisedbynarcissists,1389424463.0,"Not sure about actual age, but it does sound your GC sibling is at least emotionally younger than you. If your sibling is worth it, they will eventually understand. 

My own experience is possibly not a good one to go by, as my nMom has certainly done all in her power to manipulate my siblings to believe I am mentally crazy as a loon almost since their birth. I think after all the years of abuse there is no way I am not a little damaged, but I am not what she claims. My siblings and I are very distant in ages, with my siblings being more than ten years younger. We were always quite loving to each other, but distant in a way due to being in very different stages of our lives for so long. My nMomster found this distance extremely useful and has never failed to take what advantage of it she can. Now that I am gone, she has used the increased distance to manipulate and denigrate every interaction we've ever shared.

I would say, based on what I have read here and my own experience, you should assume your nParent will do everything in their power to put as much distance between you and the GC. Your abdication from the family will allow the nParent to consolidate their control over the GC in a way they haven't been able in your presence. Whether your GC sibling is an N or is simply riddled with fleas won't matter that much as either situation can easily be manipulated by the nParent. I know this sounds bad, but if you just assume in this way, if your GC sibling eventually does recognize and get free you will have a wonderful surprise rather than years of vain hopes crushed.

Of course, all of this is just my opinion and only you can decide what is best for you. I present it as a potential solution and I hope others will present other solutions as well, so that you will have a selection to choose from. As there is no single degree of nParent and GC, there is no one solution. To me, the greatest thing our nParents tried to take from us was the freedom of choice. I love how this sub allows a variety of choices in dealing with nParents, GC's, and the lot. It seems to me it goes a long way in returning to us something greatly missed. Free choice."

Unless there's another way to do it, I don't do it anymore and I am completely saddened by that.

The thing I will say, however, is that I don't have a webcam.  It's not by choice.  Our family computer is older and we just didn't get a cam for it.  And I didn't order one on my laptop because I'm a cheapskate.  Also, I really wouldn't be comfortable having the cam on if I did have one but I might.  It depends.

With that being said, I had a GLORIOUS time on Chatroulette.  I met people from all around the world.  (Supposedly)

p3ndulum,poker,1389424531.0,"Even though the hand is suited, I'd rather not play it out of the small blind at all when facing a raise, especially with a limper still behind me.

It's a hand that plays best against multiple opponents, and even better with position. By just flitting in the small blind, you are giving away a lot of information about the relative strength of your hand while simultaneously gaining nothing about the relative strength of your opponents hands, while also risking putting in chips only to be raised again by the limper.

Without hitting your perfect flop, you're going to just be check-folding most of the time. And even if you make a single pair, you could be setting yourself up to lose medium-to-large size pot when V2 actually has a premium hand, or when the limper flops a set, or even something like two pairs or a straight.

It's also not a very concealed hand when you end up flopping a straight, especially against competent opponents who can piece you're line together, which means you're only going to win a monster pot against something like a flopped set that doesn't improve to a boat.

If I'm going to play this hand from the SB, I'm going to try to take control of the betting early, mis-direct my opponents by putting in a 3-bet, and then hope that I completely whiff but still take the pot down with a c-bet, or flop huge while everyone thinks I have something completely different than my actual hand.

Hopefully V2 has a weak Ace or something like KJ and feels like he's out-kicked and just goes away pre-flop, but even if he just flats, he should have a pretty difficult time calling a c-bet without flopping strong (beware of the float).

It's a nice-looking hand, but it's not a very profitable situation IMO, so with only a fraction of my stack ($2) in the pot, I have no problems donating the two bucks and saving the rest off chips for a mucho more advantageous situation."

BuildMyPaperHeart,AskMen,1389424578.0,"(a) The religion and culture thing will definitely curb your potential pool. If it's not beyond reason, you could maybe consider widening the net to include, say, other related religions, or different cultures of some kind. Sure they might have some conflicts, but if you are both okay with the differences then you could have a really robust relationship. Of course, make sure you two are aware of your religions BEFORE you engage in a relationship, or one of you will get hurt.

(b) I feel you there. Take it at your own pace!

(c) If you're confident enough in who you are, forget what your parents think of your relationship. Your happiness should come first, but if your happiness is in part due to your parents' wishes, that's totally fine as well. 

(d) Self-confidence is definitely a major hurdle. You just have to see the worth in yourself, and it can be hard sometimes. Try talking with more of your female friends if you've got any, or even just female co-workers. Keep it platonic, and just engage in conversations with them. You'd be surprised how female friends keep you grounded, and it's good practice talking to them when a girl does come along that you're interested in (well, only slightly; it's still hard).

I know there's really no normal--Kinsey and Masters and Johnson all destroyed that myth--but then there's gender identity disorder. It takes something most people take for granted and makes it a life-or-death issue. If you don't have it, you have little chance of understanding it, and there's really no good way to know for sure! So you have this disorder and people can just assume that it's all in your head (which is only literally true--there's nothing we can do about it), or that you can change your mind. And at once, gender becomes unimportant to them, and gravely significant at the same time because we're not supposed to care about gender but at the same time it's necessary that we stay our assigned gender. I just hate all these mind games and doublethink and cognitive dissonance.

She's had such a hard life already. It's no one's fault besides the people who let her down, but I feel like I'm just adding to the list. Like you said, maybe, ultimately, the two of us will just have to disagree on this, though. It's not like her sadness and anger and disapproval is going to make me male, it just makes us miserable. She might come to feel that she can't handle be married to a woman, and I should be prepared for that. And because it's a possibility I have to accept, then her grief should come as no surprise. It doesn't make it hurt any less, it just changes the conclusions I come to. I don't want fear someone I love any longer. I'll have enough fear of everyone else to deal with."

Scratchums,PuzzleAndDragons,1389424959.0,"Your ideal team is defined by your approach to the game--if you value offense, defense, or a mixture.  Most people will approach the game in an overtly offensive way, the degree to which will vary based on the amount of risk you're willing to take.  It can range from an SOD Lucifer, for example, with a comfortable boost in HP and RCV for dark types, to your Ares, with a boost to HP but also attack for dark/fire, all the way to the extremely offensive, which give no hp/RCV boost.  

My suggestion is to find what leader you like most.  Do you like comboing, regardless of element?  Try for a Kushinadahime.  Do you like comboing with specific elements?  Try one of the Chinese gods, or Ra, Horus, etc.  You can make a team entirely of physical subs with a leader who boosts physical attack, or a specific element and make a mono-team.  There are also the super niche teams like Goemon that I wouldn't suggest to most people (the goal there is to keep your HP below 20%) or Anubis (you have to be able to do 10 combos regularly).  Once you have an approach to the game, filling up your bench, to speak, is about arming yourself with the necessary skills to make a team well-rounded--oftentimes a means for stalling, healing, orb conversion, damage spiking, or straightforward attacks. 

That said, to break it down by element, dark and light monsters are popular because they don't have weaknesses, however wood, water, and fire monsters are generally easier to level in mid-game because you can find Pengras of those elements in non-event dungeons.    

For further reading and inspiration, you may this intro to team building thread helpful (and as you consider your style, think about what element or leader to which you gravitate):

Aside from that, I think I have learned that I like when there is a little less similarity in our body shape/size because it makes me less nervous. That sounds weird but I have so many more romantic expectations when the guy looks to be roughly the same size as me. I end up freaking them out and i die of a broken heart.

 The officer reappears around 1 minute and moves the car to block her body.

The camera zooms in on her body @ 1:28.

Programming could greatly reduce the amount of repetitive effort when working with spreadsheets, emails, schedules, transferring information, querying databases, generating reports, or many other areas.

Thus, it would certainly be beneficial in an office setting, in particular if you are working often with data or a database somehow.

Additionally, there are a lot of jobs that require significant programming, but as a means and not an end (i.e., software development).  For example, as a statistician, analyst, or non-computer engineer, you would need to use programming to work with data and models, but not actually develop software products.

Relative suffers from a possibly deadly condition common to old age, and suffers a severe setback so is hospitalized. It is the third such hospitalization, and the second this year. Further, a couple of other older relatives have similar situations going on in their lives and have been hospitalized over the last year or even quite recently.

Also, here's one that took down a PTQ. Older (from March 2013), but it shows that the deck **can** take down a big tournament:

http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1104517

&gt; trying to tell people that Soul Sisters is competitive is just wrong. You're vastly overstating it's matchups.

No, I'm not. I've played this deck for months and I've played against many players piloting many decks. These numbers all come from my own personal experience piloting the deck, and many other people will tell you the same. I can go in depth about certain matchups if you want me to explain why the deck is good/bad in certain scenarios. There are only 3 decks I have consistently had issue with. Jund (I win about 30-40% of the time, but those wins feel really rough. Hitting my SB cards makes a huge difference, but G1 is probably a 20/80 split in the Jund players favor if they are good and the draws are equal), GR Tron (game 1 is 35/65 in the Tron players favor typically depending on draws and how aggressive my hand is. A mull to 5 is all but a guaranteed loss. Post board with Stony Silence and Suppression Field, as well as other board cards, it is more 60/40.), and UB control (a rogue deck, but man is Night of Soul's Betrayal, Damnation, SB infests, Lili, etc really rough. This is about 10/90 in G1, and about 30/70 in G2 if all draws are equal). I'm not telling anyone that Soul Sisters is a massive force in the meta like Jund is, but it matches up VERY well against more than half of the top tier decks and is VERY resilient and well equipped to take down the various rogue decks out there. 

Matchup break down:

**""Insta-win"":**

-Burn

-Aggro Loam

-Goblins

-Zoo

-Affinity

-Scapeshift

-Merfolk

-Death and Taxes

-UR Twin


**50/50 or better:**

-Monoblue Tron

-Boros

-Living End

-GW Hexproof

-UWR Twin

-UWR Control (draw dependent)

-Pod

-Infect

-Storm

-Angels Grace/Ad Nauseum (draw dependent)

-Soul Sisters (assuming similar build and draw, the games will end in someone decking)


**Worse than 50/50:**

-Jund

-GR Tron 

-Bloom Titan 

-UB Control

-UR Fairy Delver


I can expand on these matchups if you like as I've played each of these matchups at least a half dozen times (far more than that in the case of certain decks). Dismissing a deck that is very good against a large number of decks, and one that has a chance against many others out of hand just because it can be built on a budget is just silly. Honestly, Jund is the only deck that really has good or better matchups everywhere, and we can't all play Jund."

Necron_Overlord,funny,1389426682.0,"&gt;Romance novels have a male equivalent. It's porn. The romance novel market doesn't cater to men because men are more visual than women. Women read romance novels because a story and emotional connection helps us get off. Men watch porn because the visual stimulation helps them get off.

This paragraph right here is one of the most misandrist and hateful things I have read about men in a while.  Romance is not the equivalent of porn, it's the equivalent of male adventure fantasy -- the genre I happen to write in professionally.  Men need fantasy every bit as much as women do, and consigning male fantasy to the realm of porn is both unhealthy for men, and shows an incredible lack of respect for the complexity of male sexuality and 

&gt;Who the hell is talking about abolishing comics? Every girl I've talked to who is into comics doesn't want them abolished - they just want females without impossible anatomy in the vast majority of comics. I genuinely think there's an audience there that comics aren't selling to. I mean, hell, manga sells GREAT with girls, so it's not like a visual novel format is impossible to sell to females.

You, right here, are talking about abolishing comics *unless they appeal to women.*  Do you really not see that?

See, right now men buy comics as they exist, and they like them as they currently exist.  Women don't like them very much, so they don't buy them.  And what you and other people who make these kind of arguments do is demand that comic publishers change comics to appeal to theoretical women readers. There's never any acknowledgement that maybe men like comics the way they are, and that things don't need to change.  

What it boils down to is that comics as they currently exist favor a masculine power fantasy which does not appeal to women.  Women aren't terribly interested in stories about powerful, masculine dudes who do awesome things and are surrounded by powerful, sexy women.  Which is fair, nobody says they have to like it.  What isn't fair is this attitude you're displaying, [this attitude.](http://i.imgur.com/dnioHaE.jpg)

It's never suggested that there simply needs to be more comics written, with new comics being made to appeal to women.  It's never suggested that women should try their hand at writing and publishing their own comics if they don't like what is being sold.  what is always suggested is that the comics that **currently** appeal to men need to change to be made acceptable to women.  There can't be anything in the world that isn't female-friendly.

All men are allowed to have is porn and shame.

&gt;I don't know what time comic
 book companies have tried to ""cater"" to women. But, I'll admit, I'm not that into comic books, so if there's times they have, I've just never seen them reported. Would you mind giving me a few examples?

I'm more familiar with Marvel, so I'll just focus on their efforts:  Back in the 70s Marvel attempted to introduce a range of female superheros to appeal to women readers.  These characters included Dazzler, Ms. Marvel, She-Hulk, Spider-Woman and Red Sonja. There comics were all basically the *exact* same stories they were selling to men done in the same style, but with a female protagonist and generally some pop feminism thrown in.  They were attacked as sexist for their efforts.  Mostly by people who never read a comic in their life.  

Their most recent efforts have been things like [Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Spider-Man_Loves_Mary_Jane_1.jpg), which is based on manga style storytelling, and was cancelled due to low sales.  There have been like six different attempts at a Mary Jane comic, all of which have failed.

The reality is that comics is an industry dominated by men, and they simply don't know how to cater their product to women in a way that actually generates sales.  Instead, they get hammered on constantly by people like you -- people who are happy to imply they are sexist and to demand they cater to women, but who don't actually know anything about comics."

On sites where the demographic is older and the prices are steeper, the gender ratio of active users starts skewing in favour of men.

awwwwyehmutherfurk,AskReddit,1389426924.0,"I work a door to door job in Australia. One of the homes I knocked belong to an old German man. He was a ME pilot during the war and was shot down over Poland by the Russians and ended up in a Russian PoW camp. While he was there he met a soviet officer who saved his life. He'd met this officer before - in the skies over Poland. He'd shot the Russian down by shooting out his tail. As the Russian was coming down on his parachute he circled around a few times and saluted him. Remembering this when they met again in the camp the Russian asked why he didn't just shoot him anyway. ""I told him because I didn't want to kill anyone. My family is very religious and do not believe it is right, that is why I aimed for your tail and did not get you as you were parachuting"". 
The Russian returned the favour by saving him from execution. He was let out a few years later then moved to Australia, married a beautiful philipino woman and had kids and looked after her for the next 40 years. Now it's just him and his dog because he died a few years ago. 
He was a lovely man. "

Gonji89,AskReddit,1389427099.0,"This is no bullshit, when I drove to California (from North Carolina, where I live) in 2005, I stopped at this little run down gas station somewhere between Albequerque, New Mexico and the Grand Canyon in Arizona. It was in the middle of the desert on some shiny salt flats. No houses, towns, or roads besides I-40 anywhere in sight. As I pulled up to get some gas I happened to glance West and, as I did, I saw someone on a bicycle peddling slowly toward the station. I watched the person as they rode lazily across the desert, wondering what in the fuck they were thinking riding a bicycle when it's 100+ degrees outside.  

When the person pulled up under the roof over the pumps, I saw that it was an old man. When I say ""old"", I mean fucking ancient. He had to have been 80, at least. He had a long, white beard and his skin was tanned and wrinkled from, presumable, being in the sun for ages. He had on a wide-brimmed straw hat, a stained Hawaiian shirt that was hanging open, cut-off blue jeans, no shoes, and (I shit you not) a goddamn eye-patch. His bicycle looked about as old as he was and rusty as hell and he had a walking stick stuck down in a PVC pipe that was zip-tied to the frame. When he stopped he just nodded at me and said, ""Howdy."" I stood there for a second, stunned, before I responded with ""Uh... Hi."" He put down his kickstand and got off the bike, stretching his creaking joints. He asked me where I was headed and I told him ""California"" and we talked for a few minutes about how nice iCalifornia is and so on. When he went to get back on his bike, I asked him where he was headed. He said ""Oh, nowhere in particular."" so I offered him a few bottles of water and some tomatoes I had in the cooler in my car, which he graciously accepted. Before departing, he turned to me and said, ""If you're heading West, be careful, son. There's a mighty big storm brewing."" The sky was blue, no clouds or anything but I thanked him all the same.  

As I was pulling back out onto the highway I noticed two big-ass ravens sitting on the ""76"" sign out front of the station. Every time a car would pass one would go ""caw"", which made me laugh because it sounded like they were counting the cars and saying ""car"". Sure enough, about 3 hours later I drive into a hell of a storm. Hail in the desert type shit. I pull off the highway onto the shoulder and decide to wait it out and as I do so, I keep thinking about that old man and it hit me. I still, to this day, wonder if I might have given water and some tomatoes to Odin.  

tl;dr: I gave some tomatoes to a Norse god."

Riali,ABraThatFits,1389427656.0,"Firstly, is that tight underbust as tight as you can get it?  Completely exhaled, pulling like you're trying to break the tape?  It's unusual not to have any squish in your ribcage, so it's worth double checking.

Otherwise, your measurements indicate a 30D/DD.  30D is one cup volume bigger than 32B, and 30DD is two.  In your current bra, the cups are, I believe, a bit shallow and a good bit small.  The curling outward on the edges of cups is sometimes seen in too small moulded cups, where the breast is pushing against the lining and distorting the symmetry of the cup construction.  There is a bit of gapping along the top, but I do think it's mostly a shape issue.  Are you scooping and swooping -when you but the bra on, lean over and really scoop everything into the cups- sideboob, underboob, all of it?  You might find you're even overflowing if you do.  It likely won't stay, as the band is too big and the cups too small, but you'll get an idea what your boobs are capable of . 

Take a look at the shape guide next, as that makes a massive difference in fit."

I couldn't find a link on YouTube or any other free site.  Sorry guys!  This is my first post on r/Documentaries and if you ignore the modest, less-than-polished quality of this film I think you'll agree that it rings a strong and underrated message about how without fathers, boys never know at which point they become a man, and girls never get the objective validation that is missing from Mom's loving, unconditional affection.

Some on Netflix have reviewed this as either religious or misogynistic propaganda, but bare in mind that I've watched this documentary with an open-mind, and I consider myself to be pretty left-leaning as far as wanting society to be mostly secular and to appreciate both genders for their unique differences and strengths, and it seems to me that these people who are screaming ""propaganda!"" are the ones who are either brainwashed or just trying to call attention to themselves.

My point with that is, please watch this with an open mind.  If you think it's skewed to a biased and unfair view point, then turn it off.  And if you do, I personally think you're wrong and ridiculous, but you're entitled to your opinion so I'm not going to argue with that."

blackirishboy45,CallOfDuty,1389427785.0,"Let me just give you my thoughts on your points. These may be biased and personal, but maybe they can sway your viewpoints.

1. Spawns: the spawn system is kinda messed up in certain game modes. The modes I play are cranked, tdm, dom, and snr. In TDM and Cranked, there are some bad spawns. But I have found that for the most part that they are consistent as long as the teams are split evenly across the map. Those game modes where teams are intermingled around the map, spawns are bound to get weird. That's been a part of every Cod. The dom spawns are less organized than before, which I understand the change to disallow spawn camping. Before, teams could get trapped in their spawn. Now, their spawns are inconsistent throughout the map, allowing more balanced play and allowing for comebacks.

2. Maps: The only map I really dislike is Chasm. too many levels, strange sight lines, very inconsistent from typical cod. Most other maps are relatively balanced, similar to other Cods. My personal favorite is Warhawk. Not much else I can say about them.

3. Try using single-shot AR's. Their damage is really good, normally killing in 2 or 3 bullets. In this Cod, there are more close quarters than others. But I think that means you just need to change your sniping and where you hardscope. On freight, there's sniping opportunites in the 3 story buildings. you just need to make them. they're there, on almost every map. just a little less clear than before.

4. Game types: I agree, I was pissed originally at the removal of classic game modes. However, the changes to dom make it different and new, while not really changing it too much. Cranked and Search and Rescue are both fun, with cranked really being a new game mode while SnR is a twist on old SnD. I think this problem could be solved by acclimating to the game. 

5. Kill streaks: I think the dog is one of the coolest killstreaks ever. just really unique for the game. the change from uav's to satcom's is, again, original and different. however, I think it removes that aspect of the game, forcing players to communicate, use the map, and rely less on the mini map. Just a little different.

To conclude, I agree it's different, and while some things may seem worse, some changes begin poorly. I would try to give it more time, try other game modes, other guns, and maybe adapt to the game. however, if it's not for you, it's not for you. leaves more kills for me "

While I was searching for it I hear someone enter the room. I turn around and there he is. He asked me if I found what I was looking for. I did not know what to do or say so I just started mumbling looking down on the floor. Then I just stopped and looked up again. He was standing really close to me.

We two have been in a mediated situation wherein she would present her alternative viewpoints and I would quietly present proof she was lying.

She'd immediately claim foggy memory from old age and insist it happened at another time which she knew I would have greater difficulty providing proof against. 

Luckily for me, the mediator was not the sort to have the wool pulled over her eyes in such a manner, though that's another story. The look of hatred she gave the poor mediator when he directly called her out was certainly priceless, though. I'd never seen her give anyone other than me such a look of vile revulsion in my life!

Her ideal is to go mid, with a tanky support + AD bot and Tank/initiator top and AP jungle.

Ap jungles are pretty meh at the moment and poke/burst supports sit on most of the common tank supports.

If you get the line up rolling though, the enemy team has two ADCs they have to deal with, one of which (quinn) can seamlessly swap over to an AD assassin. It's a lot of DPS pumping out provided your team comp has the appropriate CC to cover it.

I'd actually imagine it'd eat the current tank meta alive, Nasus can only wither one ADC. Cept AP jungles literally can't do anything right now, and without one its to easy for the enemy team to stack armor."

Rinnve,russian,1389428351.0,"&gt; By the gulags I mean prisons. Both the members of Pussy Riot and and Mikhail Khadarkovsky spoke about their awful treatment, forced labor, and discrimination in Russian prisons. They all refer to these 'prisons' as camps because thats what they are. They live in cells with 12 other people. By day they work 18+ hours in a factory sewing military and police uniforms. They aren't allowed to bathe more than once a week, not fed, etc. Just horrible treatment in general. The similarities of their stories and Solzhenitsyns Gulag Archipelago are strikingly similar even though one predates the other by 40 years.

First, if you find similarities with Solzhenitsin's Gulag Archipelago, you must read it again. Second, you mentioned Khodorkovsky... I cannot find any interview with him mentioning something like ""18+ hours work"" or ""not fed"". 

&gt; A friend of mine and former classmate decided not to leave Russia because he had opened a school and several businesses. Eventually all were closed down. When he went to the business bureau and he asked why they were closed down. He was told very rudely and completely openly that it was simply because he had not payed off the head of the bureau for his district.

There is no such thing like ""business bureau"". Business in Russia cannot just ""close down"" without a reason. I'd guess that you were bullshitted.

&gt; As to North Korean labor camps, vice has a piece about it.

That piece with a video about British company running logging operation with North Korean contracted workers? Mmmkay.

&gt; Education: I understand that Russia's current system is one of the best in the world, but many people don't have access to it simply because there is such a large divide in the wealth classes. Most people in cities go to school, but people in Siberia don't have access to much education, much less good education.

It is not because divide in the wealth classes. It is because there are no freaking universities in Siberian taiga! There is nice one in Novosibirsk though.

&gt; Again going back to the wealth and social divide, people who are very poor are starving. This is perhaps connected to the problems with narcotics smuggling which mostly occurs in Siberia where most of the poorer people live.

Having these abilities in your back pocket will be very useful in any office environmental where you work with data or spreadsheets of any kind.  [Here](http://excelexposure.com/) is a link to a lot of good material.

Second, learn basic Python so you can develop scripts.  This will require some basic understanding of things like variables, control loops, and functions, but not some of the higher level concepts like object oriented or optimization.

Focus instead on things like how to read and write files, how to manipulate values/strings, how to access websites or databases, and how to call external programs.  

Give yourself projects to teach yourself.  Perhaps a program that opens a file that contains a list of websites and parameters.  Then, the program accesses those websites, grabs the data, manipulates the data based on the parameters, and then saves it to an Excel format file."
BuildMyPaperHeart,Warframe,1389428926.0,"Refrain from making statements which attack the person whom you are replying. Please focus on the argument and opinions, and only that.

Example:

* ""I disagree with your statement here for XYZ"" is acceptable.

* ""Your logic in this statement is flawed because XYZ"" is not. 

The difference is clear: in the first, the **statement** is the noun of the sentence. Thus, any problems you have is with the statement, the opinion, the facts, and the discussion. In the second, the noun is the **logic** of the person in question, which is a much more personal word to use. While yes, perhaps some people are more sensitive than others, but if we are to have discussions, then they must be civil.

This goes for all parties involved. Be excellent to each other."

savoytruffle,AskReddit,1389428932.0,"I was in Bangkok before my train trip up north. I was In west PatPong, which is where all the prostitutes are. But somehow I was in the gay man area?

I was having a drink in a club while a nubile young man massaged my bicep and I watched two men actually have anal sex on stage.

Yikes!

The next day on the train to Ayutthaya I was disgusted by my memory, but at the time I was there in the moment.

I asked my young man wouldn't he rather not be a male prostitute? And stuff like that. Meanwhile the guy onstage is definitely going at it on the other guy.

My young hired companion said he liked it and tried to kiss me.

Okaaaay! Time to go!"
lynn,Parenting,1389428940.0,"It's one thing to live austerely in order to save up, and quite another to drive yourself slowly insane (or, more likely, into depression) by having no time to yourself and never getting out of the house.

I started taking my daughter to the YMCA's child care 4-5 days a week when she was a little over 2 years old. The socialization time made her blossom from a selfish, shy toddler to a far more confident and often friendly preschooler who's very willing to share. And I got an hour and a half to work out, knit, whatever.

You and your toddler *need* to get out of the house. You need social time. These are not wants that can be put aside while you focus on your goals. They are human needs. Loosen the belt a little and make some friends.

Speaking of which, don't discount the possibility of making friends with parents of different ages. I find that most of the conversation between parents tends to be about kids anyway, and that you do have in common with them."

I_RAPE_MY_SLAVES,news,1389428947.0,"I personally don't like using 1/3=0.333... as an example (or at least as the only example) because I feel it doesn't satisfy anyone who holds .9999... != 1.

A reason a lot of people don't accept .999... = 1 is that, in the back of their mind, they still intuitively feel there's a final 9. Using a .333... doesn't change anything because the same intuition suggests there's a final 3. Using Roflkopt3r's example better demonstrates the difference between finite and infinite decimals, and that often helps the idea that there really are infinite 9s (or 3s) click.

It depends on the person, though. I know plenty who prefer .333...*3."

Small amounts of negative camber (when the bottom of the wheel is further out than the top) can improve grip in cornering on the outside tire due to the fact that it compensates for any suspension lift, and large amounts of negative camber will impair handling (causing slides) but is often used for drifting to allow a slide to begin easier (hence you will often see drift cars with large amounts of negative camber on the front wheels and tiny/no negative camber on the back, allowing a slide to begin easy by giving the front wheels little traction and keep the slide moving by giving the rear wheels straight to keep maximum contact with the road in a rwd car).

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389429258.0,"Men call women ""crazy"" when women use emotions to manipulate arguments, which women do all the time because it's easy and there are little or no consequences.  What women do is predicate their positions on arguments that cannot be falsified because their proof is reliant on women's **supposed** superior intuition and understanding of emotion. Whether women actually are more emotionally developed and mature than men is, I think, *extremely* arguable; suffice to say *they* believe it's true and argue accordingly.

An example would be when a woman frames an argument so that any disagreement with her is interpreted as a sign of disrespect or lack of love.  A man can't win an argument framed in that way, because it's like The Game -- if you try to play, you lose.  She'll never need to explain why or how it is disrespect or malice, that she asserts it is is sufficient proof in her mind.

Another example would be when a woman responds to a rational argument made by a man by explaining what he ""actually"" means or explaining ""why"" he believes that, in such a way that it ""proves"" that his argument is irrelevant.  Women often do this by framing men's emotions and desires as irrelevant as well.  You can't win an argument against someone whose position is that they understand your own mind better than you do.

When men say women are crazy, what they really mean is that women *make* men crazy.  Because women who use these sort of emotionally manipulative styles of arguing are counting on one thing:  That men will control their tempers.  

That's what these styles of arguments are designed to do; they are designed to frustrate men until we start to lose our temper, at which point we've been trained to shut up and stop arguing and just *give in*, lest we get angry and engage in some old-fashioned domestic violence.  Most of us learn to just laugh and accept that women do this, and then complain about how women are all crazy (because it seriously is a *rare* woman who doesn't do this).

At the end of the day though, women aren't crazy.  They know their arguments are bullshit, and that it's all emotional manipulation.  They laugh at us behind our back, because they think they're so much smarter than us, because they can play us like that.  They're just narcissists."

duckface08,AskWomen,1389429746.0,"I think there are studies that confirm that people like their personal space. Who you let into your personal space is dependent on your relationship with that person. For example, generally speaking, I think most people prefer strangers to be at least an arm's length away, which is a typical distance for strangers conversing with each other. Friends are allowed closer, but not too close, while people you can be intimate with (i.e. SOs, close family) are allowed immediately next to you/touching you. These distances are not set in stone and are not the same for everyone; personal preferences and culture probably play a part, too. For example, I was raised in a family that was never very physically affectionate with each other (we love each other, but we just don't show it physically), so I'm not used to people being physically close to me or touching me.

I'm no expert or psychologist, though.

ialsohaveadobro,relationships,1389430061.0,"&gt; His wife left him for another man  
  
Is it possible he's coping with that by ""evening the score"" by getting into a relationship with someone else's wife?  Just a thought.
  
But mainly, I want to agree with the ""fog"" sentiment and reinforce the reality that you are, indeed, in fantasyland with this new guy, and there is literally no hope that real life with him would feel just like this.  Right now it's just all the good parts--the attention, the appreciation, the infatuation.  A real relationship, as you know, has a lot of warts to it too.  You likely have no real idea of what his warts will be.  For all you know, his wife left him because he's an abusive, controlling jerk.  He may just happen to be the kind of abusive, controlling jerk who knows how to put on a great facade.
  
So the real issue, to me, is that your motivation for this emotional affair is that you are not satisfied in your marriage and you seem to have no realistic hope that you will be satisfied in it.  That's the reason to think hard about ending it, not this new guy.  That's where you need to focus for your decision.  The new guy is a symptom, not a cause."

GeoffreyArnold,short,1389430162.0,"&gt;If anything the first thing to suspect might be that their culture is affecting their evolutionary norms since we have one exception on one variable.

I could almost accept that. Culture can often manipulate our evolutionary tendencies. But, you should have examined the thesis of the study. It says that most ancient tribal groups did not sort by height, but that height became an important factor in mate selection during the Industrial revolution, thanks to the rise of the modern city. 

I guess that I generally find evolutionary physiology less than meaningful when it comes to these topics. It attempts to take modern behaviors, much of which are entirely social, and link that to assumptions about ancient behavior regarding survival.  But it does so usually based on the widespread behaviors of modern White People of a geographical location and environment that was radically different than the savannas on which we evolved. In other words, it's a discipline (evo psychology) which requires a ton of assumptions.  "

As it is though, I wouldn't mind Jace. He's been around for ages, he's iconic, brings up the correct imagery of mystery and magic in most of his art, even if you have no idea who he is. No matter how you feel personally about Jace, he's a good brand image."

davidlove,hiphopheads,1389430529.0,"I can't think of any examples off the dome, but here's music theory 101. In any key, a scale is established. Say the song is in C major. That means the basis for the song is a C major scale: C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C. Within this, each note is assigned a corresponding number. C is 1, D is 2, etc. A basic major chord is the 1,3, and 5. In the case of a C major, this would be C, E, and G. The major 7 that /u/riyoh mentioned includes a B, which gives the chord a sound one might call ""jazzy.""

The #11 extension follows the same principle, except the 11th note from the tonic (C) is raised one semitone, making it an F#. 

I didn't explain it very well, but maybe it helped a bit? It's easier when you've got a piano in front of you."

AaronRodgersMustache,golf,1389430564.0,"Oh absolutely. This was about 8 years ago, when I was 15. I was kind of the loser of my group of friends, you know, that nigga everyone stole on. I took up golf, and was getting decent. Kind of petty, but the last hole to win our little gambling match I sunk about a 40 footer, and I remember watching it take a big swooping break, and about halfway you just get that feeling it has a chance, and a few feet out you know its going in. First time I beat em all as well. 

First time I felt that, that surge of confidence, like, I could get good. This could be my thing, I could be really good at this. It's possible. And that little success plus the resulting love of the game after I spent time playing it grew to an obsession. Spent the next few years addicted and after a year I was waxing em and had taken my place as best in our group. Felt amazing. Getting that confidence on the course helped me bring it off the course and develop socially really.. I was always the quiet guy with nothing to say, but really, once I came out of my shell and we all matured from being  little shits, they became my best friends.

It offers no **special** recourse or protections to a transitioning person. All people have the same right to freedom from harassment by landlords/the workplace/etc regardless of gender identity or gender expression. 

Which means you have the same protections you would have if you were a male being discriminated against as if you were a male transitioning to a female.

* More reasonable memory.

I spent most of my teens and twenties celibate because of that. It made me stay home at night, because going out was just going to confront me with it again. It made angry, sad and depressed and guess what the only real comfort was...

I did not experience any physical consequences of being fat until age 30, besides not being very good at sports. But mentally, it was the bane of my existence and very nearly the end of it. 

For me, it was a mental health problem with a physical side effect. 

(I lost 100 pounds since 2011-2012 and kept them off. I'm no longer morbidly obese, just obese.)

For example: If a woman expects me to give up *all* of my hobbies (indefinitely) because she feels that she is being neglected whilst i'm disposed with them.

Edit: /u/littlelibertine in the thread you linked seems to be a relatively good example of 'crazy'. Reading through the amendments she's made to her OP, and some of her replies in the thread itself, it seems she is simply seeking validation of her opinion, that it *was wrong* for someone to call her crazy. I would hazard a guess that she is just bitter about being referred to as 'crazy' by an ex, for being unreasonable... and it's unreasonable to be angry about that.

I really disliked the guy to for awhile. I read ESPN, watched their broadcasts where they just trashed the guys personallity. But in actually watching him on the field, I am slowly coming around to believing they are behaving as they always to in creating a story out of small things and trashing the guy.

I'm a huge opponent of the idea that homeopathy or ""fire cutting"" are better than a placebo, but if it prevents that the doctors use opiates or other medicine with side effects, I think that these things have their place in hospitals.

However, I hate Boiron laboratories for having built their business on a lie (They explicitly say to their clients that it has more effects than a placebo).

BANKS
Fusing dark R&amp;B with thunderous electronic grooves, she has collaborated with underground British producers such as Jamie Woon, Lil Silva and Totally Extinct Dinosaurs.
But she hails from LA, where she turned to music to combat a bout of depression, aged 15. Expressing her fear and loneliness through music helped her cope - and she says she wants fans to hear her lyrics and feel they’re not alone. 
Her London EP, released by British label Good Years in September, led to a support slot with woozy R&amp;B soulmate The Weeknd, and she has recently been putting the finishing touches to her debut album.
Banks cites Fiona Apple and Lauryn Hill among her influences and can count the likes of Katy Perry, Jessie Ware and Lily Allen as champions of her soulful style."" - [Source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01ky6g6/profiles/banks)

ejchristian86,aww,1389432519.0,"As a former employee of the San Francisco Zoo (where Pike lives), I feel it's my responsibility to post this information EVERY GODDAMN TIME THIS PICTURE GETS POSTED.

1. Pike (pronounce peek-ah) is a female. ALL the polar bears at the SF Zoo are female. They once brought in what they thought was a male polar bear, Andy, to be Pike's mate and hopefully make little baby polar bears, but oops, it was another girl, most likely incorrectly sexed at birth. (And no, life did not find a way.) That's okay, though - the two shared their enclosure for many years and were BFFs up until Andy passed away in 2010.

2. The post title says ""California Zoo,"" which of course conjurs up the idea of hot sunny beaches and whatever... but like I said, Pike lives in San Francisco; despite what you may have seen on TV, we get like one week of nice weather every year, and the rest of the time it's cold and foggy. Especially at the San Francisco Zoo, which is located right on the coast in a near-constant cover of fog and clouds. It rarely gets above 60 degrees Fahrenheit, which is about what you get in the summer in their natural habitats in Alaska (and no, they don't have snow year-round throughout their entire range). Most of the time it's around 50. In the rare event that it does get warmer than that, or if they just don't want to stare at the public's ugly faces anymore, the animals have a temperature-controlled, off-public indoor enclosure they can enter at any time. They also have a cold pool in the public area of the exhibit.

3. Just to cut off the inevitable ""OMG zoos are so cruel, she should be released back into the wild""... Pike was born in captivity; releasing her into the wild would mean certain death. The SF Zoo takes great care of its animals, and is in fact home to the oldest living polar bear in North America: Pikes neighbor, Ulu, who is 32 or 33 iirc. Recent zoo births include a tiger (twins were born a few years ago) and a mountain gorilla (again, another was born just a few years ago), and one of the rhinos has had more babies than any other in captivity, ever, significantly helping the conservation of these animals.

TL;DR Pike doesn't need your pity party; her life is pretty good."

calexanderj,AskMen,1389432629.0,"&gt; I guess this is a weird question

Yep

&gt; But I've always wondered why so many guys consider sex one of the most important parts of a relationship.

Biology? Instinct? Evolution? I'm not sure the 'why' is important.

&gt; If you loved someone but couldn't have sex with them for any given reason (LDR, abstinence, etc), how much would that matter?

It depends. For how long are we talking about?  LDRs are not that uncommon, and there are guys who wait til marriage. Not a lot percentage wise, but there are some out there. And when you say no sex, do you just mean no PIV, or are we talking about no sexual activity at all? It's going to be a hard sell if you're looking for a guy who will forgo all physical contact

&gt;  I want to be seen as a great girl because of who I am, not because of how good/bad I am in bed. 

Most guys fall in love with a girl because she's great and not because of how good she is in bed. Sure there are guys who use girls just for sex, but if a guy is spending quality time with you, treats you right, and you have a genuine relationship where you talk and enjoy each other's company, it's almost certainly not just for the sex. It would be way too much effort to fake all of that just to get laid.

&gt; I want to feel like who I am is the reason someone wants to be with me. 

Isn't how you are in bed part of who you are? Just sayin'. It seems a little naive to assume that if you have sex, you'll be unable tell why a guy is with you.

BikerMouseFromMars,rpg,1389432633.0,"The Heroes Handbook (M&amp;M 3rd Edition) has a small chapter about the dying topic. It's Open Game License, so it is okay to post it.

The Mutants &amp; MastermindsDamage effect makes it relatively difficult to kill someone outright; the target has to first be incapacitated, then further damage causes them to become dying and potentially die. If you want to up the level of lethality in your game, you can apply some or all of the following options:


* Allow attackers to “go for the kill” when they attack. In this case, incapacitating the target also results in their condition becoming dying.
* Use minioncharacters and have a “taken out” result against them equal the minion being killed rather than simply incapacitated.
* Have certain kinds of attacks—such as guns, fire, or lasers—alwayscount as “going for the kill” when they are used.
* Add dying to the third degree conditions an Affliction effect may impose.
* Have four or more degrees of failure on a resistance check against Damage (and Afflictions that cause the dying condition) result in immediate death. This is a particularly harsh option to impose, but heroes still gain the benefit of hero points to help them avoid this fate.
* Make conditions suffered from a killing attack slower to recover: one condition per hour or even per day. This emphasizes their seriousness. Also see the Lasting Injuriessidebar in the Recoverysection of Chapter 8"

Most of the problems in HS are driven by yours and your peers' insecurities. The bullying, the exclusion, the fights, etc are caused by people's own feelings of inadequacy and/or problems from their own personal life emerging (and hormones being crazy). As you and the people around you grow up these issues either decrease in severity, or people learn healthier ways to deal with them besides taking their emotion out on others. 

Also, you yourself are still developing. I'm nearly done with college and that little, awkward person that waddled into HS seems like only a shell of what I am now. That's not a bad thing, it's just something everyone goes through.

Along with developing, you tend to figure out more about your niche. You find out what hobbies you really, really like, what types of people you associate best with, what really makes you happy, etc. 

However, this does not = once I'm out of HS, life is infinitely better. It isn't a light switch like that. You could have shitty college years, or HS could be really awesome for you - maybe you've come into your own early, and nothing really feels different. Not everyone has the same experiences in life, but in general, the people that had it really bad in high school look back and laugh. What they went through was such a small portion of their life. It is not permanent. It's four years, you've been alive more than 3 times that time period. Chin up, get good grades to the best of your ability, push yourself to branch out and face your fears, get involved in something new, and steer as clear of the drama as you can. IF you attempt these things, I promise the reward in the long term out weighs the risk. 

Wish you luck, bud."

Berean_Katz,DebateReligion,1389432746.0,"I see what you're saying about Judas betraying Jesus, making him unworthy of praise to Christians by nature of his malintent. Being an atheist, however, I don't see Jesus as being Lord--so within the Jesus Trilemma he could only be either a Liar or a Lunatic. With those two possibilities, I don't think Judas really was as sinister as Christianity paints him out to be. Granted, I wouldn't have allowed *anyone* regardless of character to get tortured through crucifixion, at least we can see where Judas was coming from, given the historical context. If Jesus wasn't God, Judas was one of the few people who was able to read through the lies of his supposed divinity.

Either way, I still have objections regarding the whole nature of this sacrifice to begin with. If God is omniscient, he should have known ahead of time that humanity would sin and fall away. That being the case, the very fact that humanity *DID* sin and fall away shouldn't have surprised God in the least. He not only should have predicted it, but he also could have prevented it, given his omnipotence. It's also strange that the method he chose to forgive mankind was by impregnating a virgin and sacrificing himself to himself to act as a loophole for rules that he himself established in the first place.

&gt;And of course, there are atonement theories that downplay the actual death on the cross itself, seeing its importance more as part of a narrative of Christ's obedience to God at all costs. The bloody death didn't have to occur to us to be saved, even if it became inevitable based on the message Jesus was preaching and the context in which he preached it.

If Jesus didn't have to die, then God should have been able to prevent it or stop it from happening. If all God had to do to forgive mankind was simply say ""I forgive you,"" then the sacrifice was pointless and nothing more than Christianity's excuse to glorify someone's gruesome death. Even then, as I've mentioned in other posts, Jesus' sacrifice is hardly a sacrifice at all given the context. He not only *didn't* die, but he rose to heaven as the Ruler of All Creation. Sounds like a deal anyone would be willing to make, and hardly worthy of being labeled a ""sacrifice,"" in my honest opinion."

This happens every now and then to my thumb with no rhyme or reason.  It began when I was working at a pizza joint and I assumed it was a reaction to something there.  There is no ""typical"" amount of time from one breakout to the next: this is the first time in three years or so that it has happened.  

It starts with an itchy spot on the side of my thumb--SUPER itchy.  The itch lasts for about a minute and then becomes a pretty awful burning sensation.  This fades too, for a little whiole, and that's where the pictures come in.  The first is three or four hours after the itch--that's when the bubbling starts.  It swells up like a cluster of blisters, which you can see in the other pictures (the second is about 12 hours after the first, the third about another 12-15 from there).  It gets really nasty looking and the pain comes back, a very strong burning sensation.

So what I'm looking for is can anyone tell me what this might be?  Has anyone else experienced something similar, or can you offer any advice on how I can prevent it occurring again?  It's very irritating, being on my main hand and in a very awkward spot (bandaids are almost impossible to keep on it, and my thumb brushes EVERYTHING).

Jakuskrzypk,AskReddit,1389433339.0,"Strzyga, Poland. A strzyga (Polish pronunciation: [ˈstʂɨɡa]) is a female demon a bit similar to vampire in Slavic (and especially Polish) folklore. People who were born with two hearts and two souls and two sets of teeth (the second one barely visible) were believed to be strzygas. Furthermore a newborn child with already developed teeth was also believed to be one. When a person was identified as a strzyga he was chased away from human dwelling places. Such strzygas usually died at a young age, but, according to belief, only one of their two souls would pass to the afterlife; the other soul was believed to cause the deceased strzyga to come back to life and prey upon other living beings. These undead strzyga were believed to fly at night in a form of an owl and attack night-time travelers and people who had wandered off into the woods at night, sucking out their blood and eating their insides. Strzyga were also believed to be satisfied with animal blood, for a short period of time.
When person believed to be a strzyga died, decapitating the corpse and burying the head separate from the rest of the body was believed to prevent the strzyga from rising from the dead; burying the body face down with a sickle around its head was believed to work as well.
According to the other sources strzygas were believed not to harm people but to herald someone's imminent death. In this they resemble Banshees."

LeoKhenir,AskReddit,1389433357.0,"Norway also boasts creatures like:

The ""hulder"". Appearance of a beautiful woman, except with a long furry troll tail. Lures young men into the woods, and they never see the tail before it's too late.

""Nøkken"" - often depicted as a young (often also naked) pretty boy who sits on stones in ponds, lakes or rivers, plays the flute (or violin) to lure kids into the water to drown.

""Fjøsnisse"", literally ""barn goblin"" or similar. Closely related to Ireland's leprechauns. A small man (two-three feet high) who lives on farms. Appearance kinda like Santa Claus, he's chubby, long beard and red top hat, and a knitted woolen sweater. Will help the farm if he's treated right (food left out, the farmer takes good care of the animals and the produce, et cetera), but can cause quite a lot of trouble if the farmer neglects his duties or doesn't treat him with respect. I believe the tradition of leaving food out for Santa Claus might originate from this myth.

There's also a myriad of what's called *nisser*, *tusser* and *vetter*, which basically are creatures of the forest. *Nisser* are ""wild"" variants of the fjøsnisse. Most often they just cause mischief, but can also be harmful if the humans don't treat their territory with respect. *Tusser* are more common in little-travelled areas.

However, the ideal goal would be some as of yet unimagined mechanism to achieve this elegantly and simply. Imagine some kind of super tiny nano-bot cloud that just went around fixing fixable cells and killing unfixable ones based on a given template. Remember, human cells are rather large within their realm so this isn't 100% crazy.

Sure, it's sci-fi right now, but, 50 years ago, this very conversation, where it is taking place, how, and every other aspect about it was sci-fi as well.

Given the continued advances in nano-technology and materials science, it will be very surprising if we can't achieve something like this within the century."

Gertiel,AskReddit,1389433926.0,"My parents were not noticeably religious at all in my youngest years. They only even started to go to church at my encouragement when I was 9 or 10. Now they're your typical Bible Belt pounders, especially my mum. Always sharing religious stuff on facebook and sending pointed religious email forwards.

Being religious was pretty ubiquitous in the Bible-belt small town I was raised in. To the point if you wanted to have anyone to play with as a young child or hang out with as a teen on Wednesday evenings and Sundays, or to go on the trips the greater part of your class went on during holidays, church attendance was mandatory. Thus listening extensively to the indoctrination provided at church services and youth meets.

Summers meant church camps. Christmas break meant church ski trips. Spring break meant mission trips to help with things like building schools in third world countries for high school kids and church camps for the younger lot. Even long weekend school breaks came with trips to various youth camps, especially for the older set. Further, due to building use laws, even secular groups such as Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and the like were held at churches where participants were strongly encouraged to enter into participation in the church they were held in only slightly exception granted for those active in other churches.

I was pretty religious when I was younger because I just accepted what was spoon fed to me at those mandatory attendance events. I only really got away from it when I began to learn more about history. A pivotal moment was discovering the story of the flood appears in historical records which pre-date Christianity just with different names. Straight up plagiarism. 

I guess I would now best technically be described as agnostic atheist."

lumpking69,SimCity,1389434842.0,"Well, its a very grey rule and its hard to know what they mean by it. 

&gt; Mods must not jeopardize the integrity of the gameplay or harm the experience of others. 

Would larger cities jeopardize the integrity of the gameplay? If it does, I'm not really sure how. Nor can I fathom how it would harm anyone's experience. 

&gt; Mods that affect the simulation for multiplayer games and multiplayer features, such as leaderboards or trading with other players, are not allowed.

This is where I think it gets tricky. I think there is a (weak) argument that a larger city might give a person a boost in the leaderboards and maybe an advantage over players in non-biggie sized regions. I think its a weak argument because I don't think a larger city would really give anyone a real advantage. After all, all that it would do is make it so you dont have to jump from city to city. You can still have everything a multiple city player would have, its just not spread out so wide. 

I really don't know though. There may be things that I am missing. I wanted to post this question on the simcity forums but fucking EA cock blocked me. Don't ask, I just can't post/read the forums for some reason.

Exactly! You get two good messages for the price of one, not all elves are racist pricks and dwarves are not some isolated animals. I didn't like the whole idea of Kili being wounded and needing elf help, I didn't like how Tauriel worked ""elvish healing magic"" by orgasmic whispers (I'm a herbalism enthusiast and I hoped for some down to earth, science-ish, 'technical' dwarfish healing ; still, elves are known to be master healers, and the sparkles were a callback to LOTR I think, so I'll let that slide), but when people complain about her getting enthusiastic about starlight? *She's a bloody elf.

Necron_Overlord,movies,1389434895.0,"&gt;Volsunga is saying that the studio knew that audiences would respond better to the seemingly helpless, inexperienced astronaut if the character was female.

There's a serious problem with this sort of analysis: it creates a catch 22 that is unresolvable.  The problem arises because of a reality of drama: It's necessary for the story that the protagonist be helpless and inexperienced, or there is no *drama*.  Gravity becomes an entirely different (and fairly boring) story if the protagonist remains perfectly calm and knows exactly what to do and does it.

So if the character is cast female, then the complaint becomes the one being made here, that the character is portrayed as weak and vulnerable and needing men, and is therefore sexist.  If the character was cast male, then the complaint becomes that Hollywood doesn't make movies with female leads and is therefore sexist. 

There is no winning in this game, because the point of these sort of analysis is to find sexism in whatever they look at."

elerico,gaybros,1389435105.0,"Here's what you do: first, rewrite this so I can understand what the fuck you're talking about without having to read it three times. Second, stop calling it ""shizzy bizzy"" because (I'm assuming) you're an adult.

You get comfortable with sex by doing one of two things. You can either take small steps into the pool by establishing clear boundaries of what you will/won't do, so the pressure to have sex is off the table. This allows you to take things at your own pace and really explore the sex part of your sexuality. Eventually, you'll be comfortable enough to take the next step, and then the next. Eventually, you'll have no problem having sex.

The alternate way (what I did) is to take the plunge into the deep end and fuck on the first date of your entire life, thereby having just awful, awkward sex. Then it can only get better from there!

I'd recommend the first. In any case, the worst thing you can do is try to escape this for as long as you can. Own your own sexual desires and don't make excuses for yourself. What do you want? What's going to make you happy? Don't do something just because someone else expects you to, do it because you want to.

Berean_Katz,DebateReligion,1389435522.0,"I think you could pretty much summarize the Christian moral argument as this: *I don't know where morality comes from, therefore God.*

Clearly, this is intellectually dishonest. Just because you don't know where something came from, doesn't mean positing God as an explanation makes any scientific sense. As Neil Degrasse Tyson eloquently put it: ""If that's how you want to invoke your evidence for God, then God is an ever-receding pocket of scientific ignorance that's getting smaller and smaller and smaller as time goes on."" It's essentially the good ol' God of the Gaps argument, also known as the Argument from Ignorance.

With that being said, it's a wonder that Christians speak of morality at all, considering that *their* philosophy completely disregards the morality of a person in the first place. Instead, simply believing in Jesus is all it takes to be rewarded an eternity in heaven. If we were to flip the script and look at a non-Christian who lived an objectively moral life but didn't believe in Jesus, the Christian would say that person would go to hell. So clearly morality has nothing to do with Christian philosophy at all. You could argue all day long about the ""good"" things that the Bible teaches you, but you'd also be ignoring all the atrocities committed and commanded by Yahweh himself. How many times did he kill off a vast number of people to suit his supposedly moral narrative? The Flood, the firstborn of Egypt, the Midianites, the Amalekites, the Canaanites, the list goes on. A lot of the people he killed were children. He killed a group of 42 children by mauling them to death by bears simply for laughing at a bald man (**2 Kings 2:23-24**). He commanded the Jews to slaughter the ""heathen"" Midianites, including the male children, and taking the virgin daughters for themselves (**Numbers 31**). He sanctions slavery, saying that Jews enslaving Jews is to be treated more as indentured servitude (**Exodus 21:2-6**), but if Jews enslaved non-Jews, they were permitted to beat them with rods as long they don't die within a day or two, and treat them as property (**Exodus 21:20-21**). Jesus himself commanded ""slaves to obey their masters, including the cruel masters"" (**1 Peter 2:18**). There's a plethora of examples such as these, and no context whatsoever could possibly make these things OK, especially considering the paradox of God commanding us ""thou shalt not kill.""

Christian morality is not based on ethics. It doesn't concern with the well-being of conscious creatures, human or otherwise. It doesn't concern with the preservation of a free society with the equal treatment of all, as humanism would have it. It doesn't care whether you love or respect your fellow man, no matter how much it would seem that way if you were to cherry pick verses. Religious morality is based on divine edict: ""What I say goes."" It doesn't base itself upon rationality or well-being. If that were the case, the Bible wouldn't see homosexuals as ""abominations"" (**Leviticus 18:22**). It wouldn't punish individuals with eternal torment for mere disbelief (**John 3:36**). It wouldn't command you to kill witches (**Exodus 22:18**), especially considering witchcraft isn't even real. All of this is objectively immoral to any rational person.

With all that being said, I will never understand how a Christian can invoke the moral argument, given the nature of their own belief systems. I have plenty of Christian friends and I love them dearly. The problem isn't the people, the problem is the ideas. Until they recognize that atheism doesn't necessarily mean ""immoral,"" there is no reason why I should change my perception of Christian philosophy either, especially considering it's based on what their own Bible actually says. Christians can be perfectly moral. But so can atheists."

Necron_Overlord,movies,1389435623.0,"&gt;I'm not saying there is absolutely no positive female presence in these movies, but you cannot argue any of these have female leads. James Bond and Indiana Jones are clearly the leads

They're clearly the *male* leads.  But all of those movies also have female leads. 

In the Indiana Jones films the female leads are Marion Ravenwood (Raiders, Kingdom), Willie Scott (Temple) and Elsa (Crusade).  Crusade is the only one of the films where the female lead doesn't have her own subplot (because of Sean Connery's character filling in where the female lead normally would).

A ""lead"" is just the top-billed actor, and most films have a male lead and a female lead.  Which lead is has a larger story role tends to be more a genre issue than anything else.  Action/adventure stories tend to have male leads because action/adventure is primarily a genre for men.  The inverse is true of romances."

Gertiel,solotravel,1389436178.0,"Think of it this way. You want an item which can only be used once and disappears. Since you financed it, you will be paying for it way after the item is used and gone. Not only that, due to the interest and any fees, you've agreed to pay a premium over and above the actual purchase price of the item. This doesn't seem like very good financial sense and is what these people are on about.

Personally, I think much depends upon your overall situation. 

As an example, suppose you just graduated college and will be starting a very demanding but well-paid job in 3 months. Your income from the job will allow you to pay for the travel loan in just 4 months while simultaneously paying all your living expenses and putting away 10% in savings. There is further incentive to travel while you are able during the three months as the job, like so many in the US, only allows for 1 week of vacation after 1 year and 2 after five years service is completed. In this situation, I think a loan or using cards to fund the three months travel is not so unreasonable. 

Of course this is a best-case, but I think you can see the direction my thoughts take. As long as you are able to repay the loan without damaging your future life, I think it may not be the best financial decision, but may be a good decision for your mental well-being."

Necron_Overlord,movies,1389436216.0,"*You* are why people think feminists are obnoxious.  If you ever find yourself wondering why, now you know.

This has nothing at all to do with sexism.  It has to do with teenage boys having disposable income and no girlfriends, so they go see the same actions flicks a dozen times and drive up box offices, so Hollywood caters to them.  

It has to do with the reality that most stories with female protagonists -- romantic comedies and dramas -- don't require a twenty foot tall screen and surround sound to enjoy, and do better as rentals than first run box office smashes.

Box office toppers tend to be big huge action adventure movies full of explosions because those kinds of movies are thrill-rides that people go see again and again.  They tend to feature male leads because those stories tend to revolve around people who do dangerously exciting work, and the vast majority of people who do that kind of work are men."

Which is true, and now that I think of it, it makes perfect sense (my friends complained a lot about that) that the dwarves don't *feel* like a team. No, they don't, that's the point.

He also says a bit about fighting different incarnations of Azog for AUJ (a man in orc costume, a man in greenscreen costume, and a tennis ball on a stick :D) and explains that the orcs pursuing the company are meant to drive home that they are not safe anywhere. There's a long bit about Thorin wanting to erase the failings of his father and grandfather, desperate to bring pride and prosperity back to his people, which is important because in the third film he's going to lose sight of his initial motivation.

TheCanadianAsian,AskReddit,1389436250.0,"My first job was at a Quiznos. A co-worker and I were shooting the shit and insulin in the back office, he had diabetes, and the topic of conversation turned to blow jobs. So I tell him that the girl I most recently had sex with couldnt fit my dick in her mouth and that she had a nasty vice-grip.

Ding, we hear a customer walk in, so we walk out to the front. Now, I was dumb and kept talking about blowjobs. When we were walking out I was doing the ol' pretend to have a dick in my mouth, hand motion and tongue pressed on my cheek. At this time the customer looks at me and I just rush into the back and let my co-worker take her order.

When he put the sub through the oven, I came out and said ""Do you ever brush the back of your teeth?"" and I do the ""blowjob"" motion and he slowly starts saying he does and he uses this kind of toothpaste. He finishes her order and she leaves. We both go into the back while he is laughing his ass off, Im having a heart attack worrying if the customer is going to complain to my boss later or if my boss is going to watch the security cameras.

No one complained and I worked there for another year until I said ""Meet me out back at 8"" when a customer asked for a ""footlong""."

TNSGT,FifaCareers,1389436287.0,"I've always been a fan of creating a team from scratch for use in the second or third tier, with players to suit. I have a blend of older players who I'll base off of good players but have lost their touch, 25-30 year olds who are average, and younger players who are not first team ready but have a high potential. I name the team after something local and give them a small stadium.

I only give the team a number of players to make the first team and subs, then some money to purchase others so I have the option of a decent depth of average players, or a thin team with one or two decent players.

I enjoy it, and I'd definitely recommend it, and I've found that I don't feel as bad for letting some players go as I don't have any sort of connection to them like if I was managing a team I supported where you can have favourites that you may not sell even if they're not as good as others.

I also found that some of my players (because I randomised some players stats) are specialists in certain aspects (not like the FIFA specialities) which makes you alter your play style to accommodate certain players.

Main draw back is the fact that the game can sometimes be unplayable with a created team, to the point the game may crash when you pause the game."

Plus, it just seems far more exciting for Cersei to continue her reign of madness in King's Landing than being convicted and killed, or forced to go into hiding. 

After Kevan's death she's going to be even more paranoid about Tyrion and the Tyrells. Think of the juicy conflict between Cersei, the Tyrells and the Faith if she wins. And there's still Margaery's trial by Faith, Lady Nym joining the high council, the foreshadowed death of her children. Cersei's our window into all of this. She's the only POV we've got inside King's Landing until Arianne and/or Jon Conn coming knocking at the gates with Aegon. 

Plus, whilst I know a lot of people favour the theory, Sandor = the volonqar just seems so unsatisfactory in terms of Cersei's storyline. 

And the alternative - Sandor finding peace, then inexplicably coming back for vengeance and *dying* against Robert Strong - would be cruel even for GRRM. "

evilbrent,careerguidance,1389436876.0,"You are bound by the conditions of your contract.

You are not bound by imaginary conditions or conditions on someone else's contract. You made an agreement with your employer, you signed it, they signed it, that's the end of it. (You have your copy right?)

I personally would only bring up that you aren't required to pay them a cent after you have your money in your pocket. I mean by that - what sort of company do you work for? Is it a fly-by-night place that's going to stiff you? Or is it a stand-up company that'll honor its agreements? By which I mean is it expected that they will take this payment out of your final paycheck? Or are you expected to write them a check from your bank account when you give notice? See how they're different?

I'd say just go ahead and leave and don't worry about it. For a start if they do make an attempt to make you pay they'll have absolutely no leg to stand on, and for a second, so what? It's a grand, which is a lot of money, but in the end you have to follow the job that is best for you and a grand is a drop in the bucket compared to that.

(Only thing I would be wary of is if there is a CHANCE that they could have changed their copy of your contract then you have to get that sorted out ASAP. The official copy (in their eyes) is probably the copy that they hold. Your copy is probably just a copy for your own reference as far as their concerned.)

A lot of people have theorised Bonifer Hasty. The pious knight Jaime left in charge of Harrenhal. He's closeby to King's Landing, he's not a Lannister support (he only bent the knee after Blackwater) and his piety is well-known so he'll probably be known to people in the Faith. He seems to be a talented knight, since he won a tourney in his youth before he gave up jousting. Certainly a  much better choice than Lancel, and a more likely one than the crippled, unknown, reformed Sandor.

nerowasframed,politics,1389437784.0,"Yeah I was just going to make a point about this. This isn't about marijuana or even states' rights. It's more so about a Obama not enforcing a law that was passed by Congress.

However, given the past ample leeway afforded to the President with respect to the Faithful Execution Clause by previous Supreme Court cases as well as the finite resources for law enforcement, President Obama is well within his rights to de-prioritize enforcing federal laws concerning marijuana. In that respect, he has not so much completely stopped enforcing the laws as much as he's basically saying ""we have bigger fish to fry, we can worry about marijuana users another day."" And, like I said, given the precedence set before with respect to the Faithful Execution Clause, President Obama has the right to do this.

You're absolutely right about the last thing that was said:

&gt; the next executive can come in and enforce federal law and throw all the legal growers, sellers, and users in prison. We need to change federal law.

That is the biggest problem with not enforcing (and not paying attention to) the federal law while constantly progressing states laws on these issues. The Supremacy Clause as well as that case you cited give the president more than enough right to make all those progressive state laws completely futile."

Meliae,sex,1389438013.0,"The first time my boyfriend and I had sex. 

It was like rediscovering sex. I've had really good sex before. Sex I never thought was possible until I had it. 

But he topped every single thing. The way he wanted me was intense and it showed in every thing he did. How deeply his fingers sunk into my skin with desperate.. desire. How he'd kiss me, lip bruising, teeth scraping, breath stealing hunger. How he tasted and nipped and sucked every inch of my body, savagely. How he penetrated me to the core, like I belonged to him. 

Lust at that intensity is like a drug. 

I remember how time seemed to just vanish. (We fucked for over nine hours, breaking away from each other only for a cigarette and a water. 

And inevitably, we'd incidentally brush each other's body, or catch a hungry stare, and like it was gravity we fell back into each other again and again. And each time was better than the last. He pushed me to my limits and I him, then we'd break them and try new ones. 

We fucked, we had sex, and we made love. On the bed. On the couch. On the floor. On the stairs. 

Even though the sex we have now, being in love with each other, is even better, I look back at that night and seriously contemplating selling my soul to back and relive it. 

There's nothing like the first time. "

When you add a lot to the gif (Modern Family downvote) is that all done manually frame by frame, or does AE allow you a simple way to do this?  I ask because I remember you mentioning once that making these takes days or weeks and I know that I have abandoned a few gifs based upon how much time/effort it would take in PS.  If that time/effort is reduced with AE, I would definitely consider doing more.

professor__doom,Automate,1389438099.0,"That's what they said in the late 19th century in response to the advancements made during the industrial revolution.  They developed a completely [different method of distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx), which didn't seem to work out too well.

I think the answer lies not in a complete systemic overhaul, but in some relatively moderate tweaks to the existing system.  For starters: 

* A strong tariff system, preferably one that will hold China and similar states accountable for both their enviornmental and human rights abuses.  (This is something that unions, environmentalists, and manufacturers should all support, but retail will oppose.  I'm pretty upset that our Democrat president, despite his rhetoric being pro-union, pro-environment, and pro-manufacturing, seems to be pretty [cozy](http://www.mediaite.com/online/wal-mart-heir-gives-big-donation-to-obama-campaign/) in [bed](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/03/03/obama-walmart-exec-budget-chief/1960923/) with big [retail](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2009/06/30/170849/walmart-letter/).)


* Strengthening the power of the SEC and FTC to investigate and prosecute fraud and (especially) break up monopolies.  Prior to the 1980s, monopolies were identified as such and broken up on the simple basis of market share.  In the 80s, the law was changed: the FTC could only take action if it could be proven beyond a doubt that the monopoly impacted the overall efficiency of the economy.  This definition doesn't take fairness or economic robustness into account
* A higher minimum wage, which is pegged to both inflation AND productivity statistics.
* A tax system that encourages manufacturing and discourages undistributed profits.  For starters, being able to write off machinery purchases against current-year income, instead of the stupid 10-year depreciation system.  And ending the favorable tax treatment of the financial sector.

I actually self-identify as a moderate republican in the vein of Eisenhower and Nixon.  Most of these ideas were SUPPORTED by the GOP for the first half of the twentieth century; even Nixon imposed tariffs to ensure an advantageous balance of trade."

Anyway, last year March the 15th we we're at our mutual friend's engagement party. He had a suit and a top hat for fun, and I just thought I would break the ice. I asked if I could borrow his top hat and he said I could. He took a couple of pictures of me and said I looked cute. Then I went dancing, he followed when I asked him to, and was really hot dancing and grinding against me. 
It got hot and we went on deck (it was a small party boat fastened ashore) to get a smoke, it was like minus 10-15 celsius or something. We talked a bit and then **he suddenly pulled me towards him with his hand behind my back and kissed me deeply**. I went all spaghetti! 
In the end of the night I asked if he would like to come to sleep next to me tonight, even though I don't do these kind of stuff. He said that he doesn't either, but he would love to come.

There are many reasons for this but the outcome is the same.

Add to that the media, which over here is broadly supportive of the theory of CC, even the rightwing papers, in stark contrast to Fox et al.

NO. There are only exclusive titles because people (namely, guessing by this, you) buy consoles *for* the exclusives. This then provides the profit incentive for Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to shove exclusivity into the frame. If we as gamers didn't tolerate it and considered it a black mark as opposed to a shiny star sticker, there'd be no sense to it for them and overnight they'd start developing games for all platforms because at that point that's where the money would be for them.

Scarcer,buildapc,1389438673.0,"&gt;Please tell me where you got your electrical knowledge?

*Totally an argument winner* @_@

Hey brah you brought up the *750w* argument.

**CX500w** +3.3V@25A, +5V@20A, +12V@38A, -12V@0.8A, +5VSB@3.0A

**CX600w** +3.3V@25A, +5V@25A, +12V@46A, -12V@0.8A, +5VSB@3.0A

Now regarding higher quality, besides the fact that entry models fail more often...

**Seasonic 550RM** +3.3V@20A, +5V@20A, +12V@45A, -12V@0.3A, +5Vsb@2.5A 

(**EDIT**: To clarify I'm responding to SyncMaster's question, and when speaking of quality, I speak of durability, not electrical efficiency.)

&gt;*Cry's* ""but it barely is equivalent to a CX600! You fool, you said it's better than a CX750!""

Do I have to cover every argument? CX is low quality regardless, if you have to spend the money, get the better quality. If I were to recommend 750w for SLI, I'd get flamed for quality, in which case if you can spend the money going SLI, you can obviously buy a nicer PSU.

&gt;""What's all this talk about quality!? Nonesense!""

Well you like talking about ratings, how about looking up the PSU thermal ratings for various models, I don't feel like doing all the research here. Regardless, my point which I should of made clearer for cases like this are: Less electrical load = Less thermal Load, simple quality improvements from CX to ~~GS~~ lines (EDIT: Okay, those two are now the same, outdated info.) is apparent, there's more though I'm not doing all the work for you.."
Necron_Overlord,movies,1389438677.0,"I think it's that it's really hard to tell Wonder Woman's origin story to a modern audience without it coming off as having a really *odd* subtext at the very least.

She comes from an island that is all women.  So right away modern audience are wondering ""island of lesbians?""  Try answering that one without offending someone one. If you say ""No, of course they're not lesbians."" then the response is ""Well what's wrong with lesbians?  Are you saying there's something wrong with lesbians?""  So then you say ""Sure, they're lesbians."" and someone else is like ""Isn't this for kids?  Will parent's be offended?  Will *Fox News* be offended?""

Let's assume we want to be gay friendly, so they can be lesbians. And if they are lesbians, are they *all* lesbians, or are there some very confused straight girls on Paradise Island wondering why they can't get no satisfaction?  Is Wonder Woman a lesbian?  This is going to get very important because now we're going to ask:  Why does she leave lovely amazon lesbian paradise?  Because of a man.  So, not a lesbian then?  Exposure to a man cured her lesbianism?

Basically, studios have trouble with Wonder Woman because the character's origin is really fucking messed up if you think about it, as it a lot of the character's elements. She was invented by a bondage fetishist who invented the polygraph, hence her power being to tie men up and make them tell the truth, and her weakness to being tied up, both of which were serious cases of [author appeal](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal).

It's kind of like why they left Robin out of the new Batman movies.  It's really hard to portray the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson in a way that doesn't come off as creepy and NAMBLAy.

If they ever do make a Wonder Woman movie, they're going to have to totally reinvent her origin, but that will piss off the fanboys."

NoCold,evolution,1389439016.0,"Well done OP. Just 2 of your points I would answer a bit differently;

/7. We see complex fossils because they fossilize well. Simple creatures tend to have soft bodies that don't leave much trace behind, but even then we do have fossils of soft bodied animals and even plants.

/26. (I don't think the article was asking for an example of evolution, but rather how the mechanism of evolution works). Evolution basically works by changes in DNA, which occur all the time through; mistakes in transcription/translation, virus insertions, frame shifts, radiation damage, etc. These changes can include insertion of new DNA, and deletion. Also it doesn't necessarily take ""more"" DNA to make a more complex creature. Bacteria are incredibly efficient at throwing out vestigial DNA, because it accounts for a significant percentage of their body mass. A bacteria's DNA is generally 95% coding DNA, while a human is the other way around. We have a very small percentage of coding DNA, while the rest is largely considered ""junk"". There are DNA control factors there and other important things, but a lot of it is vestigial and our cells keep it around as protection. Say your DNA is hit with a virus that inserts its own code, and your DNA is 90% vestigial and useless. Chances are your important DNA is safe. For more on that look up ""introns"" and ""exons""."

Women push men for commitment and in this day and age it isn't because they think that's the only legitimate way to have sex. We don't live in the 1950s or any age before that which had real ramifications for those who didn't play by those rules. Let's be real here.

If you want to talk about instinct, almost no man is going to want to commit to them if they're sleeping around. It's instinctual to not want to commit to promiscuous women for very obvious reasons relating to biology and how reproduction works."
Necron_Overlord,movies,1389439684.0,"It's terrible.  It's terrible and it's sexist.  It automatically discounts the vast majority of female authored stories to the trashbin.  Almost every romance ever written fails the Bechdel Test because the central conflict in a romance is *the romantic relationship* and most dialogue in a well-written story will be about the central conflict of the story.

The reason the Bechdel Test is flawed is because Allison Bechdel is a *lesbian* and thus she doesn't care for heteronormative romance stories.  That the vast majority of woman authored stories are written by heterosexual women, and they are about interpersonal relationships (i.e. romances), which means by their nature the main characters will tend to stand around talking about men.

Jane Austen is one of the most cherished women authors in history, beloved by women everywhere, with a huge fan base.  Her books are made into movies over and over and over.  And the stories all basically boil down to a bunch of women standing around talking about who should be fixed up with whom and why and why not.

I get the heteroromantic thing, where you like the idea of cuddling and whatnot but don't want to go farther. Fortunately, there are sexual people that can accept that. The girl I was with had a ridiculously high sex drive, and I didn't realize until 3 weeks into the relationship that she thought my asexuality meant I wasn't *willing* to have sex. She actually was completely fine with being in a relationship that would deprive her of sex. If people like each other enough, I guess they can get by without stuff like that.

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1389439966.0,"First of all, there is a problem with interpretation of the word ""immigrant"", where plenty of politicians and media either pick up certain immigrants to fit their current agenda or mix them later on just to ""prove"" what they argue about.

* Outside EU immigration from poor countries - people most desperate to move into UK, whatever the cost. Illegal immigrants will even work for nearly nothing (forget about NMW). Even legal ones can (for example student visa allows part time work, where students actually work F/T, so illegally, thus possibly under NMW). That group normally doesn't even think of going back to their countries as most of them don't have there any prospects of normal living (no point in writing those here as probably all of you have an idea), especially after looking at normal life in UK.
* Outside EU immigration from first world countries - obviously less desperate than above and they very often have somewhere to go back (meaning they aren't forced to live here). Probably more than a half of them comes here with a decent skill, required for UK. Some may still be working under NMW, at least for some time or work illegally (student visa restrictions, visiting visa etc). That group surely has an impact on NMW but much lower than previous group.
* Inner EU from ""western and central"" (richer) countries - probably the lowest risk group. They have mostly where to go back and can do it easily (plane ticket or couple of hours driving and you're home). They have full working rights, so they certainly tend not to work below NMW as they can legally sue an employer and have nothing to lose (nobody will send them back to their countries, they will just find a new job here). On plenty of occasions their countries pay nearly the same wages for the same done jobs and offer very similar level of social help, medical and education. I would even say the risk of lowering wages from their part is nearly at the same level as any British person who lost a job and will work for less just to have one.
* Inner EU from ""eastern Europe"" - higher risk from the group above as wages in most of those countries are lower than in western. However, in most of them very similar general level exists, meaning they have decent schooling and health system and if they earn good they can make even nicer living than in UK (as costs there are lower). That group tends to have some influence on wages but not really that much as they also know they have full working rights. As probably all of them moved overseas to make a better living and most of them try to work hard, meaning they have good ambitions, they try to go up the ladder and earn the same as British people do in certain sectors or change jobs for better ones. It does take time though.

Also, important perspective with numbers. Let's say 1mln immigrants from Eastern Europe now living in UK. That is 1/62 so about 1.5% of total UK population. Now, I'm not an economist nor good mathematician but can anybody tell me how 1.5% of total UK population can have a SERIOUS impact on wages? Even if you take into account children and pensioners, how much in percentage the total number would be? 3%? 4%? I really don't see how they could lower wages so much as to have a national discussion about it.

Western Europe numbers are probably even lower than from Eastern Europe. Outside EU is definitely higher (together with already living people and arriving) but I will not be looking into it as I made my main points."

namrettik,AskReddit,1389440233.0,"I teach college ESL.  I had a student that was...different.  I knew the first day of class.  Our program is pretty much the last one able to sign up for classrooms, so one class can meet in multiple classrooms (for instance, a three hour class can meet in three different classrooms in one day).  On the first day, the student came up to me after class and said he'd see me again in a couple days - when our class was meeting in the same classroom.  He told me he thought each classroom had a different teacher.

A couple days later, we're in a different classroom, and it has its own door to the sidewalk.  This door has a card reader for after-hours, but the door is unlocked during normal class hours.  Everyone got in just fine, but he was late, and just stared at the handle.  The whole class could see, as the entire wall was glass (including the door).  We're all waving him in or just telling him to open the door, but after 20 seconds of him just staring at the handle, a student finally gave up on him and let him in.  It took three weeks for him to figure out that he could just open the door.

He never paid attention in class; he was always watching videos on his phone with his headphones in.  His grade, and when he wasn't distracting anyone else and kept doing it after I told him not to, I gave up.  He almost never did the correct assignment, always doing random ones from the book even when he directly asked me beforehand what to do for homework or telling him what he specifically did wrong three times.

The real kicker was our final.  They had an 1.5 hours to write an essay on a topic that we covered during the course (the questions were new, but the topic was familiar).  They did not know which topic it would be on.  This kid *plagiarized his entire essay*.  He had no phone, no papers, nothing.  He memorized an entire essay, from the internet, that happened to be on the right topic.

There had to have been something off with him, and unless he went to someone on his own accord, I doubt he'll ever be diagnosed.  He didn't return the next term, so I don't know what happened to him.

Which of course brings us to the next point, that this *like, free love, man* thing is not compatible with our advanced civilization and the kinds of parental, especially paternal investment it requires. Even hunter gatherers didn't really live the hippie ideal. Most of them pair up, with some of the highest values males getting more than one mate simply due to lopsided ratios due to life simply being more dangerous in that state of nature than it was for the females.

The only way you could possibly try to make this ridiculous model work is by essentially making the vast majority of men de facto cuckolded by the state that takes resources from them in some totalitarian communist nightmare that seizes these resources under threat of imprisonment or death as most males would simply not cooperate if they weren't getting the kind of fairer that the enforced monogamy model produced.

But... isn't that my point? There's plenty of naturally cool ideas that can be used for churches and church services to make them have that organically occurring cool. The issue is that old people don't know what to do, so they not only try too hard, but try WRONG.

&gt;I see what you're describing as being kind of like a church saying ""Hey, kids carry iPhones around, and that's cool...we'll start distributing iPhone-shaped bibles!

I... no, that's something an old person would try doing. The perfect example of trying too hard and trying wrong. That's my idea of what NOT to do. Things TO do would be 1: design the buildings in a more ambient way that will appeal more to modern people, without losing the reality that it's a church. Create an ambient atmosphere people actually want to be in, since the atmosphere itself generates good feeling, and comes off modern. Cool might not be the right word, but a place people would want to be rather than be afraid of.

Next is update the music. There's plenty of good ambient and religious sounding music in movies and things... why does church music often sound stale and uninteresting? Get in some people who can rewrite the songs in a way tat taps into a modern ideal, without losing the core of their purpose. Maybe even make some new songs.

Finally, get people who will actually talk about thigns younger people find interesting. It's no secret to anyone that a lot of churches sound like the topics they talk on range from ""for a very specific type of old person."" to ""Vague and meaningless."" Sure, some versions of the message may always turn people off, but presentation is everything. "

ta1901,AskMen,1389441792.0,"Thank you for asking, educating someone about these things, so they can be realistic and be happy, is very important. There are many reasons and i'll try to cover some of them. 

1. Men on average have a much higher sex drive than women, especially before age 35. Women's sex drive, for the most part, doesn't begin until late 30s. With a few exceptions. 
2. I think men like the physical intimacy but they may not know that or understand it or want to admit it. There's something amazing about being inside someone else and looking into their eyes. 
3. Sexuality is a huge part of men's lives. Getting sex = being accepted as a sexual person = a huge confidence boost. This is a really huge issue. 

&gt; I am a virgin with a pretty low (but not nonexistent) sex drive. I want to be seen as a great girl because of who I am, not because of how good/bad I am in bed. 

Then you need to find a guy with an equally low sex drive. And you need to discuss sex after 2-3 dates, and tell him directly that you have a low sex drive. Don't waste his time or yours. The top 3 things couples fight about are: kids, money, sex. You MUST be compatible in these 3 critical areas. 
Because attitudes about these 3 items are very hard to change much. 

You need to be very realistic though. For the vast majority of men, no sex = no relationship. 


&gt; How do you know someone doesn't just want to screw you??

1. You wait to have sex 1-2 months while you date and get to know them. Players generally will not wait that long and will bail before that. 
2. You be honest with them on the first date and tell them you have a low sex drive and you won't have sex for 2 months, or whatever you think is right for you.

luxury_banana,MensRights,1389441850.0,"Sexual morality as you know it was largely about ensuring that most everyone got a fair shake at the whole fulfilling of the biological imperative thing. Women could not reasonably expect men to labor and provide resources for them and their children with no reasonable guarantee that they are getting something out of the deal.

It was a compromise. That a man would concentrate his efforts on one woman and give up his optimal sexual strategy of trying to impregnate as many women as possible. That a woman would not use her optimal [dual sexual strategy](http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/EP07160163.pdf) of trying to be impregnated by the man she both had access to and deemed to have the ""best genes"" available, while getting the most resources from whatever man she could -- as rarely do the two intersect and only the luckiest women end up with a man that has both.

It had a number of benefits. It helped largely rid us of wasteful and often violent competition over mating rights, the kind of violent competition we've seen in modernity over such things where spouse is killed as a result of infidelity is nothing compared to the slave raids of less civilized cultures like that of, say, the Ottoman empire, or tribal warfare and capture of the opposing tribe's females of the past.

It created an environment in which a man could be reasonably certain (as there was no way to tell for sure before DNA testing) that the children were his so he could channel his efforts into doing something productive that brought in resources while providing something needed that helped or. Like resource extraction via mining, logging, in more recent decades maybe even a great inventor--whatever. The point is that the effort didn't go towards fighting other men or needlessly wasteful intrasexual competition between men like we see today with the whole bigorexia phenomenon where guys spend massive amounts of their waking lives in gyms often taking dangerous things like steroids to boost their gains.

Infidelity and promiscuity completely fucks the model up leaving no reasonable man who knows even the basics of how it all works wanting any part of it, least of all contributing to it through any labor or resources. And you can't say such a man is wrong for thinking this way, either.

The bottom line is this; Most everything worthwhile that humanity has done has been in defiance of nature. You can act like an animal running purely on instinct if you want but expecting the fruits of civilization--an artificial construct in defiance of nature--for doing so probably isn't going to work out too well for you or the civilization itself if too many people start doing that."

&gt;CS500w = Bronze+

&gt;CX600W = Bronze+

&gt;Seasonic 550RM = Gold+

The difference between these models may seam marginal so you are looking over my point. (**Which I half ass attempted to include because I was responding to an argument you made in the first place which has nothing to do with my origonal post**)

Lets use a different comparison that might be more obvious.

A CX600 has a thermal rating of 40c, an HX650 has a rating of 50c to back up the manufacturers claims of durability, as you can see, this has nothing to do with efficiency rating, and may also not answer all of the differences regarding durability and forms of smart protection.

&gt;&gt;electrical load = Less thermal Load

&gt;This has nothing to do with wattage

&gt;Not only are those corsairs the same ""quality"". Probably 95% of the components inside them are identical. The only difference is likely a large transformer and filter cap. If you opened them up and looked inside they would look identical.

I realize this and is why I opt for better built hardware, especially getting into the 750w/multi GPU argument.

&gt;he same amount of current will come out of a 450w that will come out of a 750w in identical systems. What will be different however is the power that goes into them (from the wall)

Again, I realize this, and had nothing to do with my argument. If you have a low quality power supply that barely meets the build requirements, a cheap arbitrary option is to go a model higher that is rated to carry an even higher current; in theory the CX is less likely to fail by carrying the same current.

^**THIS** is the argument you are supposed to respond to.

TJDG,feminisms,1389442191.0,"I think I have a story that it would be useful for you to hear. Understanding how I developed my beliefs about feminism might help you better understand some of the problems.

For context, I am a 25 year old heterosexual man living in the south of the UK, cohabiting with my fiancée and in full time employment and part time graduate school. I consider myself feminist.

I first discovered feminism shortly after discovering pornography in 1997. I have had access to the open internet (in the sense that my parents never tried to restrict or monitor my access) from age 9. I got effectively all of my sexual education from surfing the net. I was very curious and very critical. In the end, I lost my virginity to my fiancée aged 22, so I had a very long “theory” session and very little “practice”.

I quickly learnt (from the internet), that pornography is not an accurate depiction of normal sexual behaviour. I also learnt that I found it intensely arousing. This was probably the first point at which my critical senses were triggered. If I find it really hot, why isn't it normal in relationships? Well, said the internet, because girls don't find it hot. They can find it pretty degrading, painful or coercive. My understanding developed; girls are different to me because (other than the obvious) they don't like porn-y sex. I like sex as depicted in pornography, they don't. I decided to explore this more deeply, and I discovered the concept of rape culture. 

Next, I started looking around, educating myself about rape culture and the patriarchy and such. Remember, all of this is happening purely as a result of surfing around various sites. No structured education at all. After a time, I came to the conclusion that men persecute women, that women are regularly objectified and discriminated against. I quickly came to what the 25 year old me now considered the “correct” view about things such as equal pay; that is, women should not be discriminated against based on their sex. Great.

The big problem, the problem that took me perhaps another 10 years to really solve, was this; the young tjdg's understanding of sexual objectification was that if I view, or seek to view a woman as sexually arousing, I was harming that woman. That means I can never at any point in a relationship imply that I am attracted to a woman, or that I want to sleep with her because doing so is objectification! Asking a woman to sleep with you is pressuring her into sex! Breaking up with her because she won't is coercion! I therefore entered what I now recognise as my “nice guy” phase. Always friendly, never sexual, never ever successfully starting a relationship.

I had in my head two ideas of women. The first was the pornographic ideal. I had moved to mainly stories and comics at this stage, because they tends to include more holistic storylines which lead to far better characterisation, which makes everything much more erotic. This meant that my ideal was basically a very attractive girl who (importantly) actually wanted to have sex with boys. The other idea of women I had was a “real girl”, who is found alone at a bar, looking scared and angry. This girl, just like the porn ideal, wants a satisfying, fulfilled life. Unlike the porn ideal, she doesn't want to actually have sex with anyone (for all the so-called feminist reasons described above). The “real girl” in my head was always fuzzy, half-formed. She was a clear contradiction in terms; a girl who wants a family, but would be damaged by the normal means of getting there. Who wants a relationship, but would be insulted and annoyed by any approach made by strangers. She was like a balloon with a love for porcupines.

It took me a very long time to get over this. I can't be sure I've done it yet. I've tried to read some actual, long books on feminism to try to better understand this contradiction, and I picked up my fiancée along the way; she helped considerably. I believe the misunderstandings I had around the “real girl” are very important. I believe that they are the central cause of The Red Pill; men with the beliefs I use to have say “my choices appear to be between rape culture and celibacy. That doesn't seem fair, so how can it be right?” 

That's the biggest problem that I personally have with feminism (or rather the view that I have developed of what feminism is). It critiques current culture and points out why it can be harmful, but it provides no positive alternatives. Men are defined by some feminists entirely in terms of what they shouldn't do, and never in terms of what they should do. It's like a 1950s family manual was picked up and redacted line by line with a black marker, leaving a nonsensical collection of snippets which don't fit together into a practical method of initiating or maintaining a relationship.

The start of a way to fix this is, in my view, a subtle change in the way we talk about groups of people. We need to acknowledge that there are women who are not (or perhaps not yet) feminists. I don't mean in the sense of “I don't want to apply a politically charged label to myself” but in the sense of “I enjoy playing my 1950s American gender role and feel that society as a whole would be better off following this defined set of rules.” We also need to acknowledge that it would be helpful for the debate for feminists to propose complete alternative solutions rather than just critiques of current solutions, and also that these solutions need to include a positive characterisation of men.

The problem that is think is most relevant to feminism overall is different. When a person new to feminism asks an innocent question, the response can sometimes be to RTFM. This is characteristic of a failure to properly distinguish between academic discussion and persuasive debate. If I am publishing a paper in a journal or having a discussion over coffee in a gender studies department, it is perfectly natural for me to use the word 'kyriarchy'. If I want to rehabilitate someone who I believe might become a rapist one day, is it actively harmful to my case for me to use that word. Feminist speakers making statements in public spaces often fail to pitch their language properly, leading to an unpersuasive case.

You need to approach people on their own terms to get through to them. If a right-wing person asks “won't this lead to the collapse of society?” the correct response is not RTFM, nor is it “you hate women”, and it is especially not “mens get bens”. The correct response is to explain why you believe that sexual liberation will not lead to less capable family structures. You need to explain why your proposed modification to society will not damage the things that the right-wing enquirer values. You need to use language they understand, not start by explaining a brand new vocabulary. Persuade, negotiate and educate based on genuine empathy with the person you're talking to.

Tldr; I believe feminism tends to fail out of a lack of empathy for right-wing, privileged and uninitiated viewpoints, leading to poor argumentation which does not lead to the desired social change."

In the 1990s there were trends not to challenge kids in school, and every kid who participated in a competitive challenge won and got a blue ribbon. They did this to encourage self-esteem. This discouraged personal improvement and does not reflect real life at all. In some US schools all competitive games were banned. 

But not every school was that stupid. But it did have a noticeable effect. Some kids are going to be upset if they don't win a game, but this is an opportunity to learn to deal with loss, and struggle to be better next time.

But in a non-monotheistic context, where there is no huge distinction of this kind, that would be kind of an arbitrary distinction to make.

If you want to be technical, every culture has a slightly different view of gods that is not always directly interchangeable. But it is also true that if you went into most Asian countries at the times when most were Buddhist, you would not be acting like their adoration of these entities is vastly not at all analogous to things in other cultures.

Relevant parts are here:

&gt; she argues that she eats less than 2000

and here:

&gt; She was so proud of her weight loss that she celebrated... By going back to her old habits completely. Sigh. She's put on more weight but keeps insisting she's losing.

&gt; Bonus: [She's not the only one who dares to choose her own food.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1uum5v/but_juice_is_good_for_you/) How disgusting of them!

Issue is here:

&gt; As expected, she looked at them incredulously and screeched ""but juice is good for you! I'm trying to stay healthy!"".

Again, denial of scientific evidence, plus the bizarre idea that drinking some juice is ""staying healthy"" when she eats like she does.

#Choosing her own food is not the issue. Choosing that as her food and then saying she's ""trying to stay healthy"" is the issue. This is what fatlogic is.

#You obviously missed the part where he felt he was entitled to go messing with someone's thermostat because they're too hot (because of a few extra layers of fat maybe?) or insulting someone's cooking and suggesting that ordering out results in ""better"" food.



&gt; This hambeast is annoyingly protective of his small breed dog.

Are you serious with this one. Screaming discrimination and saying ""fuck you"" to people because he doesn't want to take care of his dog properly by going to the small dog section? And you say they aren't warping logic?

&gt; ""FIRST YOU WANT TO SEGREGATE DOGS BECAUSE OF THEIR SIZE, THEN NEXT THINK YOU KNOW YOU'LL BE THROWING ME IN A CAMP, SO FUCK YOU SIR""

veevax,Politique,1389444015.0,"[Reddit est un site communautaire de partage de signets.](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit) 

C'est donc bien plus un site de partage de liens que Pinterest où tu ne peux partager que des photos avec tes cercles, ou Stumbleupon, où c'est un algorithme qui te propose des recommandations.

C'est l'essence de Reddit que d'offrir un moyen de partager du contenu. 

Je ne trouve pas que le système de Karma soit idéal pour construire un débat argumenté et contradictoire, ce qui pourtant fait la qualité d'un débat d'idées.

Sur Reddit, un commentaire qui va à l'encontre de ce que pense une communauté est très rapidement sous-scrutiné vers les profondeurs de l'oubli éternel.

Les communautés où les systèmes de commentaires fonctionnent le mieux à mon sens sont celles où la qualité du commentaire peut-être aisément évaluée. Je pense en particulier à /r/AskHistorians où il n'y a pas de débat, mais où les commentaires les plus riches et les mieux sourcés se retrouvent systématiquement en une. 

Même /r/photoshopbattles est un bon exemple.

Quand il y a une ambiguïté sur la mesure de la qualité, ça devient le bordel.

Est-ce que j'upvote parce-que c'est un point de vue riche et argumenté qui sincèrement souhaite enrichir le débat ? Ou est-ce que j'upvote parce que ce mec est d'accord avec moi ? 

Je ne vois pas Reddit comme l'outil idéal pour un débat d'idée, mais je trouve que certaines communautés sont composées de gens passionnants et je suis heureux d'avoir des débats d'idées ici."

TOWER 1: Snoooooore.

TOWER 2: Still not really feeling awake. Sometimes there are good weapons you have to think carefully about how to acquire but not for me.

TOWER 3: Hey this one has a chest in it. Oh wait I have a chest key so I don't have to bring a thief. Oh hey and I guess I unlock Caellach. Good for me.

TOWER 4: This one does a cute thing where it splits your units but I only bring three anyway. I mean I split them up but I'm not forced to, take that game.

TOWER 5: This one's silly. I bring Rennac and a chest key on someone else, then snooze through the level. 

TOWER 6: I hate these fucking walls. I bring another chest key to go left and Rennac to go up. Ross and Gerik fill up on Axes to blunt against the walls. I get to use Orson hooray.

TOWER 7: Hey guys, does anyone else remember FE6? Well I sure remember how easy this map was there. This time is no exception. I have Vanessa solo it to get rid of some of my junky lances. And hey Riev finally brought Artur a Purge Tome to use.

TOWER 8: This is the last level? Seriously? Lute and Artur solo it to get rid of tomes.

Ruins time! You know I haven't ever actually attempted the ruins. Should be fun.

RUINS 1: I'm bringing a bunch of cool guys to the club, mostly anyone who has weapons. My mages are going to be seeing less usage cause I forgot to buy anything for them but whatever I've got like a billion spears. We'll be fine.

Oh god guys this is a lot harder than I thought it'd be. All these guys have so much HP. I go into the next level a bit better equiped.

RUINS 2: I'm going to run out of weapons. Those motherfuckers have so much health. Busting out the killing weapons and hoping I have something left at the end.

They can survive 2 crits from my swordmasters or one crit and a regular hit from a max strength Ross. It's very scary.

Scarcer,buildapc,1389444952.0,"&gt;That is an utterly useless spec. It's also a lie. That's a spec the manufacture came up with entirely on there own likely by placing it into a cold room with fans at 100%. It isn't a standard or regulation. The methodology behind those tests is not universal or published.

&gt;Even if it were a legitimate number though? What exactly does that tell us? It's 10 degrees cooler than the other unit? So what, the cheapest capacitors are rated at 85c (a quality unit will have 105c). 40-70 honestly makes no difference what so ever.

You're aren't providing any argument besides brushing off what's provided while providing nothing tangible in return. I'll dubb this arbitrary and move on as you aren't leaving much less anything worth discussing, I was expecting more so I wouldn't have to lead this debate.
---

&gt;Every watt that is not used is wasted. If you can achieve a higher efficiency by sacrificing wattage you don't need there is no downside to doing that. And almost every build I see uses a ""bronze"" power supply that is more than enough for the build.

Okay this is getting ridiculous, you keep coming back to the same argument, and talking like an expert you are really providing nothing tangible so forgive me if *I'm losing patience*.

* Are you trying to say that going higher wattage on the model is wasted money because it will never get used?

* Are you trying to say that exp: 600w power supply constantly pulls 600w? ( I really hope this isn't the case. )

* Are you trying to say that going higher wattage (jesus, wattage wattage wattage, should just start saying 'Current Rating' instead because you just fly off with the wattage word out of context) is a waste because the model will fail just the same even with identical load?

---



Regardless, watts are really more about model numbers, and the rail specs are more imported, but since you keep coming back to wattage and power use, I'll ride this argument.

Obviously I don't have a cheap wall tester handy, so I'll use a database.

In the mean time I know full well power requirements have gone nothing but UP over the years but, I went a bit aggressive on eXtreme Power Supply.

4670k oc 4.2, high end desktop, 2 7200rpm drives, optical drive, 4 120mm fans, 240mm closed loop system, 780 ti... Most of it seams reasonable.

Estimated 522 to 572w.

Again, this isn't real time fact, but this is a maintained database vs the opinion of one person on the internet for power recommendations.

**EDIT:** Power went out when I was finalizing this.

---

**I'm done trying to organize my argument in order.** I'm done for the night anyway, feel like a zombie.

---

&gt;If you really think high wattage does anything for you, invest in one of these[1]
 
and see for yourself how much of it you utulize. 

**Never was my point.**

*Okay, now I'm done editing, gnight.*
---

&gt;Every watt that is not used is wasted. If you can achieve a higher efficiency by sacrificing wattage you don't need there is no downside to doing that.

Okay, this is a bit somber to read, again though you are coming back to the efficiency argument, which I was not making.

A great deal of women these days are raised in an emotionally over-permissive environment in the sense that emotional outbursts are far more likely to be tolerated in them than they are in men. I think this does a lot of women a profound disservice in failing to teach many of them how to master their emotions and how to realize that their emotional state often has little or nothing to do with external reality.

If someone has the emotional maturity of a five year old in and adult's body and insists on trying to inflict those emotions on everyone around them, then they deserve to be called bugfuck crazy. The degree to which you have mastered your own emotions speaks far more to the quality of your overall character than anything else.

There has been this ridiculous narrative being pushed over the last few decades that being overly emotional is somehow the same thing as being ""mentally healthy and expressive."" I can't even begin to tell you how many women I've known who have completely destroyed their lives (and the lives of those around them) by blindly pursuing their ""feelings.""

DoktorDemento,changemyview,1389445598.0,"I'd say that the problem with laugh tracks is that they restrict the shows which use them. If *Fresh Prince* wanted to do a joke which was a little subtle, maybe a Shakespeare joke or a callback to a previous season that they couldn't be sure everyone would get, they either put a gap for audience laughter - alienating anyone who didn't get it and breaking their immersion - or they don't - leaving those who *did* get it confused about whether it was intentional or not and breaking *their* immersion!

On the other hand, *Community* is free to do everything from a standard sitcom funny-entrance joke (enter the dean) to a *Sixteen Candles* reference which many people won't get - and both audiences will be fine. People who don't get a subtle joke won't notice it and won't lose their immersion; if they do spot a subtle joke, they can laugh just the same.

So, I don't think sitcoms with a laugh track are necessarily bad; IMO *How I Met Your Mother* (early seasons) and *Black Books* and *The IT Crowd* are all great comedies with a laugh track. But losing it opens up a whole set of possibilities, allowing stuff like *Spaced*, *Community*, *30 Rock* and *A Touch of Cloth* to be more inventive and complex.

(A secondary factor is that if something is less obvious, spotting it can feel like a ""secret"" or ""earned"" joke, further rewarding the audience who see it. I wouldn't say this is a big factor though.)

kicker7955,lostgeneration,1389445724.0,"&gt;You would have to describe why its incompleteness or inaccuracies are relevant to this particular case.

This is all I've done, every hypothetical I presented was adapted to this specific situation

So the issue is how much do prices go up, fair enough, but we will enter sociology. The reasoning that inflation will end at a point where any added benefit of the change is unperceivable is that people don't accept having less than they had in the perceivable past.

Prices will go up, from a macroeconomic perspective, until there isn't demand for them at that price point, but in **practice** because these are essential products, long before that decrease demand effects suppliers bottom line, there will be crowds of people complaining that they live worst that in our current system. 

However, the government will intervene at that point and that generates other hypotheticals.

So explain why is my assertion stupid? we already agree on the matter of inflationary pressure, what makes you think that such an unprecedented raise in buying power in sectors that are for the most part oligopolies or cartels(housing market) and service fundamental needs, won't have devastating repercussions for the social contract.

&gt;If you've ever taken an economics course in your life, you should only be more ashamed.

I am ashamed, because IRL I'm disregarded because of idealists like you. People like you are destroying our generations credibility, you have left practicality behind and instead of making a case for actual feasible change; you jerk eachother's self-righteousness egos, over the internet and complain about how unreasonable and corrupt the outside world is."

I mean shit no one was exactly creaming their pants (except me) but he still got a generally positive reception. Now one tweet to Del Rio and an anecdote from Cornette and people have turned on him completely. 

The same thing happened with Bryan joining the Wyatts. When he was ""kidnapped"" on Raw people were talking about how a heel turn for him and joining the Wyatts is literally the worst thing creative could do, but then when it happened the 2nd time people fucking love it. 

It also happened with Ryback. For weeks any discussion of him was essentially ""Faceback good, Heelback bad."" People talked about loving the ""feed me more!"" chants and how selfish CM Punk was for not putting him over even once in their feud. But then Ziggler suffers a concussion in a match with him and all anyone can talk about how overly physical he is and how he deserves to be buried.

For two years I lived in a 700 square foot apartment that was literally 90%	of our income, not counting bills. I couldn't find a job and was not doing well mentally because of the situation. I felt like I was cleaning all the time, but the place was disgusting. I never took care of myself, my ex never helped with anything, and all of my attention went to my daughter. I neglected myself, and it showed. 

Here is my advice to you:

Tackle your budget first, see where you can cut things off. If your cable is too expensive, chop it down to just internet and get Netflix. Make sure your SO has a packed lunch. Find off brands of the food you usually eat, and of your toiletries. Apply for food stamps, WIC, and TANF. See if you can switch cell phone companies and get a cheaper phone plan. Get a cheaper apartment with more light. 

As for friends, local colleges usually have mom groups. Also, check out libraries for free meetups and entertainment.

Talk to daycares near you, and get a quote on their prices for full time and part time. See if there is daycare assistance in your area. Then find and apply to every job that can at least cover daycare. Working is better for you and, in the long run, your son, than staying home right now. Even if your job only pays for daycare. "

It is possible that the helpless parents, unaware of the nature of their son's condition, assumed him to be sick or poisoned, and treated him valiantly to no avail. The page says there was a Journal of Internal Medecine, they must have fruitlessly searched it for a diagnosis of their son's illness, but there is no way that book could have helped them. They could not understand why their son did not die from his serious illness, but when they inevitably died from radiation poisoning, their son remained in the same state. Then one day, when his transformation was complete, he got up and walked out, leaving no trace and unable to face his parents' dead bodies. It's possible he made a life for himself in the wasteland, but I think it's more likely, due to his young age, grief and confusion over his parents deaths, he lost his mind like so many others and became another nameless feral ghoul."

Pashtacular,teenrelationships,1389447343.0,"Just start to flirt with her more, call her cute, compliment her clothes (if you think they deserve a compliment), Skype her a bit if you can and just flirt more. 

When you are both alone you need to start the conversation off about you two, then just ask ""Do you want to be my girlfriend?"", if she says yes then well done! If she says no, then realise that you at least made a move and tried.

If she says yes, then hug her, go in for a kiss if you feel like the mood is right, look into her eyes a lot (shows you are confident).

Being a boyfriend depends on what you want from the relationship, hold her hand in public, talk more on Skype or text, kiss her when you're together etc. 

**Please remember that you have other friends, don't leave them because if you ever break up then you need good friends to support you**

**One of my best friends got a GF and he is ignoring everyone just to be with her, once they break up he will wonder where his freinds have gone**

I would say that you need your GF to become friends with your mates because it makes it easier etc.

Necron_Overlord,movies,1389447352.0,"&gt;Uh, The Da Vinci Code was one of the best box office movies of 2006. I am pretty sure it exceeded expectations at the box office.

It barely made it's money back and has a 25% rating on rotten tomatoes, so critics *hated* it -- an audiences weren't much more enthused.  

&gt;And even The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo made grossed over $200 million worldwide.

Yeah, and then Daniel Craig went on to make *Skyfall* which brought in over a billion dollars.  Which makes *Tattoo* seem pretty lackluster.

&gt;One problem is that people expect too much out of these books.

Okay, but you have to understand that the argument I'm addressing is the argument that people should expect huge returns on popular books, so when you say that people expect too much out of these books you're basically agreeing with me.  /u/definitelynotaspy is arguing that making a movie out *The Hunger Games* was a sure-thing, a guaranteed success.

The point is that there is no such thing."

Things like body armor made out of hard enough materials to protect from such an attack are a relatively recent development.

Add to that the fact that primitive tribesmen in surviving tribes don't look very built. They either look somewhat chubby or even a little emaciated.

Invisisniper,AskReddit,1389447675.0,"There are strong philosophical arguments out there for both sides of the debate. The way I understand it in simple terms is that the theists argue that the existence of ""God"" (or some equivalent thereof, from now on referred to as God) is either necessary, or probably necessary. On the other hand, atheists argue that the existence of God is either not necessary, or probably not necessary. They then infer from this that God probably does not exist. (I should add that I believe this is a fair assumption; if God exists but does not have any impact on us, then he may as well not exist at all.)

The way I see these arguments play out is that the theists come up with some scenario which can be simply explained by the existence of God, and the atheists make up a convoluted mechanism which, if true, (it should be noted that these ideas are as verifiable as the existence of God itself) explain the scenario without the existence of God. To me, all this is is people coming up with more and more convoluted arguments to support what they have already decided is true.

Despite my bleak description, I do find these philosophical debates quite interesting. However, there's one thing that has always irked me. The simple question: ""Why?""

We have come up with solid scientific theories for the creation of the universe and creation of life in the Big Bang and Evolution. I honestly believe that, given enough time and research, the scientific method can explain any mechanism of our universe that we want to understand, all without the necessity of God. But science never has, and never will be able to give purpose to any of it.

If there were no God, it makes far more sense to me that there would be nothing at all. This universe seems so arbitrary if not for intelligent design; why should it exist at all?

In all honesty, the atheistic view of the world is a very bleak picture. I am simply a mechanism which has developed over millions of years to replicate slight variations of a specific molecule. My emotions serve no purpose other than to give this molecule higher chance of replicating. It wouldn't really matter if I were to kill myself now, or live another 100 years. Dust I am, and to dust I will return.

The idea of religion gives me something that science alone cannot, and will never be able to. Purpose. The idea that my existence has some non-zero significance. That what I do *matters.*"

&gt;No, your ""movement centre"" does not ""not understand why you must step backward."" No no no no no. Your ""movement centre"" does not ""understand"" anything. There is no elaborate game of supplying some kind of false information about wanting to jump so that you move back. The brain does not work this way, or anything close to it.

&gt;Yes, l'appel du vide absolutely counts as the classic example of what we refer to as intrusive thoughts. It's functionally identical to lots of related sorts of ""what if I just..."" private verbal behavior people engage in about, for instance, swerving to hit a pedestrian, yelling in church, punching a baby, etc. These are common. In layman's terms, certain individuals have a greater propensity for thoughts to ""stick,"" or experience greater paradoxical persistence of the thoughts in response to attempts to dismiss them--these people are prone to OCD.

If a beginner comes in with a $1000 build (okay okay I like that number) and a few regulars can cut that down to $950 (or increase performance by a $50 value without raising cost) then that's a win. 

Some lucky individuals may get a performance improvement by $100, or even $150, (but the more aggressive the changes in a specific direction, the more the arbitrary arguments show up.)

I can't fathom being annoyed/irritated by playful groping if the rest of your relationship is great. You mentioned he used to do sweet things (like the running a bath suggestion mentioned) and does no longer. 

Talk to him about what you want and what would increase your drive. If you're away from home 12+ hours and coming home to chores, I wouldn't be in the mood much either. See if he's willing to romance you a bit more, or pick up more of the slack around the house. Or evaluate your house of job. Is the money really worth a 3-hour commute and the toll on your personal life? 

Oftentimes, the problem with sex for women isn't rooted in sex at all. Your comment that your sex drive is low **nowadays** also gives me that indication. "

oldmonty,AskMen,1389449106.0,"I'm going to preface this by saying this is my opinion and I dont know either of you so I cant pretend to know your motives or whats going on in your head.

Basically, it seems to me like he doesnt know that you can afford it and thinks you are offering to buy him a ticket you can barely afford. He doesnt want you to skip out on buying things you need, as you would have to if you didnt have any money and were in your situation (no job etc.) and, as his financial situation is similar, the only logical conclusion is that you are offering to spend what little you have on him. 

Think about the idea of him spending every last penny to fly over and meet you and then skipping out on essentials like food to cover it. He doesnt want you to have to take a hit like that and thinks it would be selfish of him to take you up on that in order to be with you, which it kind of would be if you barely had any money. 

This has nothing to do with being emasculated btw, it has little to do with feeling bad about not being able to afford things, and more to do with the fact that your relationship is new and he doesnt know about your financial situation. As such he has had to make various assumptions which, however logical, turned out to not be true. This is evidenced by what he said to you ""I dont understand how you could afford it"". 

The way you said ""I have some money saved up"" also kind of reinforced this, if I heard it in that situation I would think you were saying you had just enough in savings to afford it which you had been saving for a long time. 

So my advice is this, its way to early (if indeed it has just been a couple of months) to talk about your finances with him and reveal that you have a trust fund. However, I am confident that if you reassure him that you can afford it without issue he will stop worrying about the money. "

etruscan,boardgames,1389449149.0,"I haven't played it yet, but [**Coal Baron**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143515/coal-baron) is a brand new game from Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling that's slightly heavier that your current fare, but not quite as dense as Agricola. You are in charge of a coal mine and are pulling contracts that you need to fulfil - delivering certain types/qualities of coal... so you must send workers into the mine and, using a clever little elevator gizmo, bring it back up. This lasts three rounds.

I watched [this runthrough](http://youtu.be/Ynk-G8ZR9fg) and it's convinced me that I should own this game, even though it's slightly lighter. I like the look of the puzzle, and both Kramer (El Grande, Hacienda) and Kiesling (Tikal, Java) are considered two of the greats."

Chocobean,Parenting,1389449206.0,"hey, I'm not here to judge, I just think your post is a cry for help. 

I'm pretty simliar to you in a lot of ways: 20-something SAHP with a great kid, living on single income in a small apartment, both college educated.. But some of the differences you brought up are, I believe, key differences that will make or break your life. 

Some red flags I see: 

&gt;**dark** 700 square foot apartment

Seasonal Affective Disorder is a real thing. Go get some natural spectrum light bulbs. Get some plastic or cheap flowers for the house. Put up pictures of happier times. Make comfy sitting spots for reading a book or vegging out. 

&gt; please remember that stuff costs money that WE DON'T HAVE

Library? I belong to a ""bring your own baby book club"" that meets every month. We take a book home, read it, and go back and have adult, serious discussions about non-kid stuff. If your local library doesn't already have one, you can certainly talk to a librarian and he/she'll help you HOST one. This month we're reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks; it's great. Church? Local area early childhood education initiatives? Going to the park? Playing in a puddle or the snow? Local area swimming pools should have ""family days"" that are cheap. Start your own meetup group that meets at the mall or library without spending money.

&gt;Our apartment is **dismal**

You're a homemaker. Change things up. Put up EVERY holiday decor item you have AT THE SAME TIME if it helps you.

&gt;a lot of older mothers (early 30s or so) **whom I definitely don't have anything in common with.**

You were all human beings before being parents. Age doesn't make it so that you have NOTHING in common. One of the moms from my book club is a single mother in her 40's. I have more in common with her than most others in my age group. We talk about families, about being a sibling, about politics, family policies, women's rights etc. Age has some effect on your concerns, but isn't it more interesting to hear about struggles of another age than to have a mere echo chamber ?

&gt;I'm 11 weeks with baby #2 

Not judging. But please be super careful about not having baby #3 until life is sunshine and roses again. Even the first weeks postpartum can be fertile times. 

&gt;Every day is the same

This is probably the biggest challenge for SAHP. It does suck, yeah.


&gt;When does this get better?

This got better for me, one day, suddenly, when I read a book about the destructive powers of incessant complaints. I paid closer attention to stuff that comes out of my mouth. I made a point of verbally noticing nice things in my day. Magically, life got a lot better after that. I'm not being sarcastic or trying to say you are at fault here: people like to complain, it's so natural and yet so destructive. 

&gt;This post has forced my husband and I to have a much-needed conversation 

No kidding. We're single income too, but not living in Dickinsian dystopia. We have decided that it is ridiculous to even think about buying a house in our area ([this](http://thethirtiesgrind.com/2013/08/29/absurd-vancouver-property-august-29-2013) is a 1.7 mil house, for example). It is as ridiculous to NOT have a discretionary spending amount for you as part of your budget. You have to make a decision: living well some day WITH sanity in tact, or not. If you want to talk more about living frugally, I'm all ears. We are living vastly within our means by choice as well. But please: Stop this nonsense about living austerely, right now. You are not in a prison cell, or a monk's cellar. But you are choosing to be. That's probably the biggest ""well there's your problem!"" thing I can think of. Good god...$30 a month for you, and you can decide, like a grown up ass adult, whether to have coffee or buy a dollar store trinket with it.

It's your biological duty to be the protector of your offspring. Can't tell you how many times I've woken up in my living room, weapon in hand, realizing I heard a sound and am ready to defend my child with my life. I know that sounds awful but parents have a supernatural ability to run off little sleep. When they are infants you want to respond every time they are crying because that is their only way to communicate. This means that even if they aren't crying you will have to get up several times in the night to feed them until they can eat solids which can sustain them throughout. Even when they are toddlers and they are doing that fake cry to get attention, you still have to respond. You have to remember they are trying to communicate as best they can. So, you encourage them to use words and point out what they are concerned with, rather than crying, and you do your best to interpret. It's your responsibility to teach your children how to intelligently understand their emotions and respond to any situation.

My friend is dating a girl who's asexual. She's considering asking her if an open relationship in terms of sex would be possible. Only because she loves her g/f, but has needs. Her g/f accomodates, but isn't ""into"" as much as someone who does have sexual desires. There's a huge difference in satisfaction between being with someone who wants you sexually as much as you want them, and someone who loves you, but isn't into sex.

No one is saying that you'd only *ever* be into the girl's looks, the point is that your initial interest in her *is* based on looks because of course that's all you have to go on. I don't even know how that's up for debate. Just because you are hoping you like her personality if you get to know her doesn't mean there's anything you *currently* like about her besides her looks. It's not like this implies that you're a terrible, superficial person, it's just not everyone's preference to meet strangers because they don't like starting by going by looks alone. Like personally I don't give a shit if a random stranger is cute, lots of people are cute, and I've never had trouble meeting cute guys who weren't randos.

I answered that I thought it was especially inappropriate to approach someone at a restaurant, that I didn't like being approached by strangers so the only way you could not be intrusive is to not approach, and why I felt that way.

tsukino_aiko,BabyBumps,1389449615.0,"For the record here was my reply, directed at someone who asked how you can tell if a study is ""good"": 
""Just remember what you learned in school, look at the person who's writing the post or authoring the study. What's their agenda (everyone has one, even regular doctors, this is not a bad thing)? Is there a study sited? When was it done? How many participants were in it, who were those participants (ideally they should be a large group with lots of variety)? Look at the site where it is published. Is the site trying to push something? Is the site pro or anti ________? Is the site written by only one person, multiple people? Who are those people? Who is accountable for what goes up? Is there any peer (people in the same field) review process to get published? How did you find the site (doctor rec vs almighty google)? 

Then if you do think there is a bias (again not a bad thing, everyone has a bias) do your best to try to seek out an opposing view. Never take anything as gospel and keep reading before coming to a decision, be okay with changing your mind  

good discussion ladies! Unfortunately being a history teacher, reliability of sources is a daily crusade of mine, so I think the occasional reminder to be a little skeptical is good. OH and if you want access to peer reviewed studies, check out your local library!! Any local college, university, high school or even public library will have access to databases that can help you find real medical studies on many topics and since these are all community organizations will almost always let you have at least limited access to their databases (though I have never been restricted anywhere, you just have to ask for permission sometimes)""'

TL;DR you can get access to studies, just ask and make sure that you question what your reading, don't just believe it as gospel because of _____"

svaachkuet,AdviceAnimals,1389449754.0,"Not all Asians are influenced by ""Asian cultures"". That's a stereotype. In fact, most Asian-American I know (I'm also an Asian American) try really hard to distinguish themselves from their parents' cultural background due to the strong pressure on children in the US to assimilate to a mainstream, monolingual, white-dominated society. Also, Asians bear the stigma of being perceived as perpetual foreigners, and often the only viable way to escape that perception is for one to look, act, and think hyper-American and not hang out with other Asians. Isn't that a clear enough obstacle that members of this demographic group must face, no matter what their merits are? Do you need to accuse all Asians (international and American alike) of being prone to cheating, when academic dishonesty seems to be quite rampant in undergraduate university education across the US already?"

steadymotion,asktrp,1389449800.0,"Whenever you're wondering ""how do I answer?"", what you should do is give her an answer she doesn't expect. So, if she was expecting you to say you loved it, you could say ""No, it was shit."" with a grin/or deadpan.

But in this specific case I think she's kind of going to expect both answers (both ""I liked it"" and ""I didn't like it"") because many people will say they liked it even if they didn't, but she might also be expecting you to say you didn't like it since she knows you didn't, so you'll want to go with a third option. Say something funny/sexual that you liked, which will also imply that since you found that part of the trip exciting, it means that you didn't like the trip as a whole. For example, ""Well, at least Marissa has a nice ass.""  (Talking about one of her friends who is annoying but has a nice ass as a redeeming feature). This implies that since that's all you can say about the trip, you must have found the rest of it pretty bad. But it also conveys that you're not upset about it and you're able to make a joke about it."

It's still a fact that single mothers with children from multiple fathers are heavily stigmatized in our society as short men are heavily stigmatized.  Stigma doesn't care for ""whose fault"".

The fact is that if you punch someone, there is a chance they will die. One punch can kill, and because of that I think the cowards who do this should face attempted murder [actual murder now i guess] charges and spend a long time in prison. 

Instead its more like: nobody is permanently injured? basically nothing happens maybe pay a fine. Someone is permanently brain damage? 6 months of weekend detention. Maybe. Someone dies? a year.

As fucked up as this whole situation is, drunken violence like this occurs all the time and our country seems to pretend like its nothing. The silver lining is that the victim dying will bring a lot more media attention and maybe some actual legal changes will happen.

Amonette2012,fatlogic,1389450725.0,"I know that happens a lot, but I don't think she's saying that. At all. She's complaining that being fat is affecting her love life but she isn't actually saying someone should date her despite being fat, but that she ought to be allowed to have her own standards, the same as everyone else, rather than settle for anyone who'll take her. In fact, the title of this post is horribly misleading. Why shouldn't fat people have standards? It doesn't imply that they're ALL going to expect the people they find attractive to date them if they don't comply to *their* standards, and while the complaint of 'I'm fat but I want someone hot to date' is pretty common, the titp poster in this case is simply saying 'why should I have to settle for some loser I don't like just because he's good enough to show an interest in me'. Well bloody good for her! As my mother always said, better a happy maid than a miserable wife. She's better off alone than with some asshole who maybe only asked her out because he thinks she'll be grateful and easy.

This to me seems like the poster has a horribly insensitive family who have belittled her to the point where she doesn't think she's worth the weight loss. Losing a very large amount of weight can seem like an impossible task for someone who has no support system and who has been conditioned to think they're less valuable, less capable and less worthy than the people around them. I feel really sorry for this girl, and I hope she makes it. I also hope her mother gets hit by a bus for heaping that much negativity onto her own child.

It's just when I play I don't fuck around, I've been playing mmo's my entire life so i know how they work, how to maximize Exp in any situation.

I'm not saying there aren't people like the stereotype you probably have in your head but the average power gamer isn't the basement dwelling existence that you probably associate with it. Most of us are just more skilled and more experienced at mmo's then most people. We understand mechanics faster, trends in leveling, mmo design, etc.


I don't want wow, I've never stated that, I just want a game that has more than one end game raid at launch. I don't really think i'm asking for much there do you? You'd think developers would understand that what's killing their game is catering to casual players. The slew of mmo's that have come out in the past since wow have all tried to do that, make it more approachable to the mass, dumbing down basic systems.

Why do you think they make it so simple in wow to level? because people want to raid. Aren't they giving you a free almost max level character now? But honestly i don't compare games to Wow, if anything I would compare games to Everquest which still has one of the most creative raid teams in the business. Sony is doing some pretty bold stuff lately and i can't wait to see what they have in store for us."

I'm not sure why, LMG's aren't designed to be ADS all the time, they are designed for suppression and denial and clearing areas. but they don't do any of those things. They are just biggest assault rifles with less accuracy and shorter range, with a bigger magazine.

I'm not sure what they want the LMGs to actually be, but reducing hipfire accuracy.. i'm not sure what the LMG is fore at the moment.

I suspect they want the LA to be less accuracy with the SMGs (probably) but again.. not sure what the goal is, i wish they would tell us WHY they were doing these things, so we knew the goal, and could understand the change. instead of just telling us its there."

RougeCrown,manga,1389451772.0,"As a person who spent almost a few years trying to draw manga, I urge you to draw it instead of writing down every single thing about the manga. 

Why so? First, after you write out your lore and your manga's nooks and crannies, your brain has this false sense of satisfaction and it will be much, much harder to put down everything you have in mind into imagery form. This is because your brain kind of trick you into believing that you have achieved something while in fact, you are only on the first step of making manga. Even professional mangakas don't write down everything they have. Instead they just put down key ideas, plot development, snippets, and discover the finer details as they move along. That's why artists sketch- they don't want to be bogged down by small details that ultimately don't carry any significance in the bigger picture. 

Second, writing is a very different medium from drawing. Something that sounds nice on paper might not be that appealing in visual terms. Manga is not a writing medium, its a drawing medium. Use it to convey the story instead of trying to translate a novel into a manga.

luxury_banana,MensRights,1389451797.0,"In what way. The tests are taken for a variety of reasons including suspicion or anxiety (from either gender of parent/putative parent,) court-order, immigration-related, so it's not even just ""the suspicious people may not be representative of the population and may increase the negatives in sample."" Even if you ran with that unquantifiable argument then you also have to account for the fact that there is another unquantifiable variable that is those who never suspect but nonetheless are also not the father.

Other methods I've seen to try to reduce them make even less sense. There's this idea of paternity confidence whereby the idea is that if you think it's yours it's some kind of causal factor in it actually being yours. This has the most tenuous grasp on reality as although there is some data showing that babies tend to look more like their fathers, we still find plenty and plenty of stories of men being duped and having no clue they've been duped until a decade or more later when after a divorce and a woman brazenly asking for even more in monthly goodies, the man's lawyer advises him to paternity tests and lo' and behold, not his.

The socioeconomic angle makes more sense than the confidence angle but only partially due to how women have a [dual sexual strategy](http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/EP07160163.pdf) which means they seek a man who has what they deem ""good genes"" as well as a man who has resources, although not necessarily in the same man. This theory posits that those in a higher socioeconomic class have a lesser chance of being victims of cuckoldry. This is based on the percentage of those who took tests where this data was recorded. Even if it's true, though, you have to remember the truly wealthy who only have maybe a 1-4% chance according to this reasoning only make up an infinitesimal part of the population, so the reduction to the overall percentage would be basically nothing.

So what you are left with is the empirical data which is showing a large percentage of tests show the man is not the father. Could it be less? Possibly. Could it be more? Again, possibly. Due to the nature of this and all of the vested interests in keeping this all under wraps, both politically and personally (for the women who do this) it's difficult to ascertain an actual ""real"" percentage. The only real way would be if governments did something that would be deemed unethical by testing every live birth, and preferably in secret so as to not alter the incentives/consequence via the obvious application of game theory of those who'd know they're being watched and be on better behavior."

mg115ca,magicTCG,1389452014.0,"Hmmm... According to the gatherer ruling for Reverberate: 
&gt;The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).

(Reiterate has no such rulings but the text is exactly the same, so I assume a Judge would rule it the same)

It looks like if you choose not to change any targets on the copied Reverberate, it keeps the old one, and fizzles. (that's the problem with the 'may' in the ability)

However...

If you use Wild Ricochet instead of Reiterate, you can change the target of the original Reverberate. If there anything that stops you from changing the target of a spell to itself? (Wild Ricochet to change the target of Reverberate to itself, then copy it and leave the copy with the same target (the original). The copy resolves, copying the original Reverberate, lather rinse repeat)

EDIT:nope, damn... 
&gt; [114.4 A spell or ability on the stack is an illegal target for itself.](http://www.yawgatog.com/resources/magic-rules/#R1144)

WAIT, I'VE GOT IT!
Reverberate on the stack, targeting the countered spell. Reiterate, then change the copy's target to the original Reverberate (call these reverb-O (original) and reverb-R (reiterated)). Then, Wild Ricochet also targeting the reverb-O, changing it's target to the reverb-R, and putting a second copy of Reverberate on top of the stack. You now have 2 versions of Reverberate on the stack, targeting each other, and a fresh copy of one sitting on top of the stack. Said fresh copy resolves duplicating the reverb-R, and resulting duplicate then resolves duplicating reverb-O, and *that* duplicate then resolves duplicating reverb-R, and so on and so forth."

I think assigning these types of things as ""you're not a man if..."" or ""you're not a woman if..."" is harmful to many people.

My family has a bit of a problem with food, never-ending appetite, and a tendency to relieve stress with food, it seems to run in the family.

The family members who recognize this problem have normal, or reasonable weight. The ones who fail to see it as a problem end up overweight and with health problems. Basically you cannot deal with a ""problem you do not have"".

Your husband has a problem and instead of solving it, he would like to share it with you. That way you are both fat and he is more secure in his relationship, at the expense of your health and self-esteem.

Do not know if that is all the problem, but I am pretty sure it is a big part.

I also understand your side. You got involved in something you were not ready for, it happens. And for that, you need to do what is right for you. I'd talk to her about how you feel, but keeping in mind and letting her know that you don't want to throw her out on her ass. A temporary roommate may not be an ideal situation for either one of you, but it may be one that helps her get her on her own feet.

EtherBoo,insanity,1389452550.0,"Alright, it sounds like you are not pacing yourself, which is one of the most important parts of the workout.  If I busted a nut during my warmup, I wouldn't be able to finish and I'm in the middle of Asylum 2 right now.  Instead, the key is to pace yourself.  Take note of the 3 possible intensity meters on the time bar:

      __________________________
     |        |        |33333333|
     |        |22222222|33333333|
     |11111111|22222222|33333333|

When you start the warm up, the timer bar is at the ""1"" in terms of height.  Then you do the second round of the warmup, and it bumps to a ""2"".  Then at the 3rd round, it bumps to a ""3"".  

This bar is telling you how hard to work.  If he says ""Jog it out"" and you're killing yourself right away, you're definitely doing it wrong.  You need to pace yourself.  Even sometimes at a 3, you need to say to yourself, ""I have another 10 minute circuit after this with completely different exercises, I'm going to kick it down to a 2.""

Pacing yourself is I'd say the second most important thing in this workout.  I did this workout at 320 lbs at 29 years old.  Just do what you can, and as long as you finish the DVD, even if it means you jogged during the last interval, it's better than not finishing it.

I hope this helps."

hpartist,Health,1389452603.0,"It's excellent that you're getting 8+ hours of sleep per night! That narrows it down quite a bit. 

Here's my advice based on my own experiences and a bit of research:

Since you have anxiety (like myself) try to do everything else in your power to make sure that your body is in the best condition it can be. If your mind and body are overly stressed some very important bodily functions can be put on the back-burner by your brain, such as sleeping, digestive, and immune functions. Stress is a silent killer. Some people never even realize what's causing their problems until something serious happens. Keep your stress in check. Be in control of your body. 

Since stress heavily affects the digestive system, it's important to help your body out in this. You're right about your diet not being the best. You should limit your soda intake to once a week, if not all together. Keep desserts to a minimum; a small 100-200 dessert once a day is ideal if you have a sweet tooth. Cut out fast food. Most of it is processed and isn't helping out your digestive system. And it sounds like your diet mostly consists of meats, dairy, and unhealthy starches. The majority of what you eat should be healthy, lean protein (fish, chicken, minimally processed soy), vegetables, and starches like potatoes and rice. Try to keep wheat to a minimum.

Also, working out for 45 minutes twice a week probably isn't enough physical activity for you. Yoga is an excellent option that you can do in the comfort of your own home, whenever is most convenient for you. This will also do wonders for your anxiety (trust me on this one). Traveling by foot whenever you're able to can really help keep you alert and less stressed. 

tl;dr: If you help your body out by eating the right foods, remaining active daily, and spending time doing things that you enjoy to help out with your anxiety, you'll probably have a much easier time staying awake and alert. "

Kaisharga,asexuality,1389452816.0,"Nah, don't think it's true. It is scientifically supported that feelings of disgust are inhibited by sexual arousal, yes. But that doesn't mean sex is inherently gross to everybody except when they're feeling randy, nor does it mean people with low libido also find sex and sexual topics repulsive. All of this, coincidentally, is completely independent of asexuality, which is a lack of sexual attraction, which itself is only rather indirectly related to the sexual act.

So there are people who get horny who don't want sex.

There are people who want sex but think it's disgusting.

There are people who think sex is disgusting but are happy to have it if they're in the mood for it.

There are people who think sex is always repulsive. 

And for that matter, there are people who think sex between others is fine, dandy, and even interesting--but for whom sex as a possible activity to engage themselves in is inconsiderably disgusting.

hafetysazard,canada,1389452899.0,"It really depends on which part of the job market you are looking at.  If you maintain your focus on industries which do not require a great deal of specialization, the benefits and compensation that employees in those industries are offered as new employees, tend to decrease overtime until they hit bare minimum.  The more people who are available to work a particular jobs means there is going to be more people willing to work that job at a reduced pay rate than were previously offered.

I do not see the feedback loop that you do.  What I see is more people choosing to work in saturated industries, and consequently working at reduced wages; making less money than their counterparts in other industries.

In particular industries, there is often animosity towards individuals whose grandfathered wages reflect a time where their jobs were in particularly high demand, and could demand higher compensation for their work.  This leads newcomers to imagine that their work is worth more than it currently is."

Femininity is not what women are or should be.  Both are just culturally assigned collections of traits whose gender divisions are meaningless in a broader context.

300mg lamotrigine and .5mg clonazepam in the morning, 300mg lamotrigine and .5 clonazepam at night, and then a host of various other medications to handle my other conditions. 

I can tell you right now that medication is hell some days...I dropped down to 105lbs at 5'4 at one point. It remains a struggle to keep my weight up at 120-125, because the medication makes me feel so sick that I can barely eat some days. 
Of course, you don't want to add any more fatigue than you already have or other issues by getting hold of some nausea medicine, because you're constantly tired as it is, and the wrong medicine can cause a seizure. 

They nearly killed me in the hospital for a week-long EEG, and that's how we found out how to treat my epilepsy...ha. 

She doesn't want to take the medication because it makes her feel like shit. Been there, done that. But have her shoot me a message if she'd like. I know it's hell at first...but over time, it gets better by the day.

I think what hit me the most was the change in outlook of life, well whatever a teenager can perceive. You start to realize that different people are *vastly* different, and that you can't generalize *anything*. Sure, you can group similar people together, but even then, each one has their own different ideals and dreams and views which are so very, very, unique. 

At first, I thought the difference between India and the US was night and day. It's nothing like that at all. The people who inhabit both countries are human. The light that shines each dawn comes from the same sun. The atoms in the paper I write in are still the same.

In most of the US, $250k is enough to live an upper class lifestyle, or at least be right on the border of one.

Edit: for clarification, many people even making less than $250k live in nice houses in the bay area, but they are in debt to an extent that is unthinkable for me.

Labour made a mistake with calculations by 1:5, not 1:100. Also, actual studies prove it was for Britain's benefits in any case.

If UK is concerned on the immigration then it can certainly control any further expansions and restrict limits for future countries. Why isn't it better than quitting EU at all?

The Unknown Armies book has some enlightening bits on this if you can find someone who owns a copy, but my group put this into very good practice a couple times. The most memorable of these was our decision to run a newspaper organization--we were permitted to have a printing press, and our party members included a writer, a printer, a deliveryman, a guard for the deliveryman, and an investigative journalist. Everyone had their roles in the company as well as their part to play in combat situations (for ""hard-hitting investigations,"" or occasional situations in Need for Defense of the City), and we all got into it pretty keenly. We occasionally had reasons to split up for a little while, but because we knew what ""our jobs"" were, we had a better understanding of when it was prudent and/or necessary to bring in the others, and when it was such a small matter (or so specific to our work) that we needn't bother the others while they were busy doing *their* jobs.

sturdyliver,Christianity,1389453958.0,"I think the priest may have been talking about an alleged 1880 or 1884 vision of Pope Leo XIII. There is a story that Leo XIII overheard a conversation that appeared to be between God and Satan, where Satan claimed that he could destroy God's Church if given 100 years and enough power. God told him that he would have 100 years and power within the Church. 1884 is the same year that Leo XIII introduced some additional prayers to follow the Mass, and this vision is said to have been a motivating factor. There are other variations of the story where there is no mention of a time frame, but this is the one that I think the priest mentioned.

I'm trying to find a good link on this that can explain it better than me, but the best I can get are bizarre traditionalist sites. I don't think that most Catholics are aware of this story today, and to my knowledge, there has been no statement by the Vatican as to whether or not this alleged vision is worthy of belief. However, it is a well known story within radical traditionalist circles, where it is used as evidence that Vatican II was a false council, as it fell within 100 years of this vision. Personally I don't know whether I should buy the story, but I don't feel that it should change my faith either way, so it doesn't really matter. The fact that there are significant variations on it and that it wasn't recorded for 50 years after it supposedly happened make me very skeptical."

~~I like you a lot, Peter. After Niko killed me with a fall trap in CW, you were the one who gave me enchanted gold armor on his behalf. Whenever I had passed through the Commonwealth, you always welcomed me and offered to show me around. I hear stories about what you've done for newfriend and oldfriend alike.~~

~~I was shocked when I found out how you had contributed to the vault that held many of the server's innocents. I didn't even hear about it until I had already broken most of the way through it with some other players. Hell, I was wearing your gold armor the entirety of the vault-break!~~

~~While you certainly had legitimate claims against the WP and Carson, retaliating against them by building a vault for dillcrew is ridiculous. While you said you only wanted WP inside of it, you were naive to think that dillcrew wouldn't use the vault to hold innocents that they pearled in their terror across the map.~~

~~The people in your vault are your responsibility. However, I am now much more in favor of seeing arbitration between you and the LADS.~~

StSeungRi,anime,1389454108.0,"You say that, but I believe that it's about as easy to pirate (stream/download) anime of a decent quality as it is any other popular show on Netflx, just by looking on some of the staple pirating sites.

As for file format support, I have yet to encounter a format that I haven't been able to play on a device I want to play it on (mainly since most of the devices I would think to use run Windows and Android, both of which have lots and lots of file support), and most downloads will be in one of the more popular file formats (.mkv, .avi, .mpeg4, etc.)

As someone who watches Netflix from a country outside the US (the UK in my case), where Netflix doesn't have that great of an availability of animé at all, I would say it's considerably harder to set up a VPN correctly for streaming animé from American Netflix on a myriad of devices than it is to simply torrent it and watch it where I want, how I want. The only reason I choose to use Netflix when a show is available on there is not because of its ease of use, but because I'd like to see the creators of the show get some return from my watching of it."

ElDiablo666,leaves,1389454125.0,"Good morning. One thing to keep in mind about not getting caught up in your negative thoughts is that it isn't just about relapsing down the road. Support is support. It's about meeting people where they are, not where everybody else is or getting everyone together to a certain place. You *aren't* like those people because you're you. If you had the least amount of problems there, it's still OK if you go!

The key to healing and recovery is understanding your own needs and attending to them. If you can help others on that path, all the better, but your recovery is your own. Don't let any negative thoughts pervade your mind, my friend. You will be free if you want to. That's the beautiful thing about being a human being: we're capable of so much pain and so much hope. But where we wish to triumph, we always do, just not alone.

Please also keep in mind that we're not sitting around trying to formulate national policy or budgetary restrictions or anything when we're solving our personal problems; those are community actions that are taken for the benefit of the community. Who cares if you only did something once or if you only had one craving or whatever you're getting hung up on. It doesn't matter. Focus on you and taking care of yourself and stick with what you need for your recovery. Cheers."

naimnotname,SquaredCircle,1389454206.0,"1. People hate John Cena because he represents a change in the product. They grew up with Stone Cold Steve Austin, and now they get a family friendly babyface that's always presented as super morality based, who wins all the time. Initially, he was well liked. But when they put him in the ring with solid main event talent that could teach him how to hide his weaknesses, he couldn't keep up at the time and now there's a stigma that he can't wrestle (so untrue.) 

2. Batista is the number 2 guy from this B level star era that he actually speaks of. When he left guys like Randy Orton and CM Punk easily filled his void and honestly, I personally did not miss him. He only got his spot because he worked out with Triple H and Mark Jindrak was a fuck up. Negative qualities aside, he actually managed to make a lasting connection with the audience at large and wasn't the drizzling shits in the ring. 

3. Brock Lesnar is every bit as good as they say he is, yes. He's inhuman. A man that big should not be as strong, athletic, or agile as he is. 

4. June 24, 2007 marked the end really. They still did a few raunchier things, but honestly heading into 2008, they just really needed to become a mature product. By that point in the past few years, they had a team of Mexicans riding out on lawnmovers, Chippendale's dancers called the Dicks, live sex celebrations, strip poker, a pseudo Islamic jihadist angle, and finally Chris Benoit killed his family. And that was after Mr. McMahon's limo exploded with him supposedly inside. It was getting gaudy. Like wrestling was already a parody, but had they continued down the path it was, it would've become garbage TV. Not as respectable as it is now. At least respectable enough for old talent who you thought you'd never see again to come back, like Bruno Sammartino."

On a more serious note. My stature gave a large contribution to the person I am presently. With such a sudden change, would come a change in personality, (In aspects I'm sure I don't need to point out) which I don't want. My height taught me about humility (In every sense of the word) and humbleness. If we took that option to change our height, we would be admitting that there's something objectively wrong with being relatively short (Not true), as well as admitting to yourself and others than you're embarrassed of the body you inhabit/inhabited. I don't know about you, but I can't respect someone who doesn't respect themselves. Cliché as that sounds, I'd much rather have a short/Average/tall woman who is proud of what she has and seeks to optimise what other areas she can, over a self-deprecating, self-loathing woman, who cries over an immutable trait. 

The same applies vice-versa of course, but I'm straight, so it's not applicable.

Just like we used to explain thunder and lightning as the actions of upset godlings.   Not everything in the Bible is God's direct word. Much of it is miss-understood and some of its just allegorical rather than literal. (like six days of creation.)

The warnings against witchcraft are clear and in modern society we see that people who really believe in magic are typically mentally ill or become mentally ill. (Depending on the severity, some are just slightly irrational)

Believing in witchcraft etc.. is just old fashioned superstition. Its really time for humanity to grow up.

When God made this universe, the physical laws he built into it leave no room for anything magical. 

If you can show just 1 instance of something magical, James Randi will give you 1 million dollars in cash. 

Science is the detailed study of God's work and reality, if you deny science, you deny reality.  If you deny reality, you deny God.  All beliefs in magic are simply acts of self-delusion.  (Which is not abnormal, we humans are very talented at self-delusion. )

thingsgetwhatever,AskWomen,1389454520.0,"&gt; That has more to do with the lack of meaningful purpose and direction in many men's lives, and the realities of a system that still punishes men for failing but no longer rewards success.

Does it?  Because that's not what I've heard from the mouthes of the men I've met in the mental health system.  It's not what I hear when I talk to men with problems that are horrified at the idea of treatment.  I agree that with younger generations there is a lack of purpose feeling happening, but I'm basing what I'm saying on men 30+ in age.

I think one can guide into adulthood without the guidance being as gender specific.  I think one can guide into adulthood without the ""MAN UP"" catch phrase.  I don't think guidance is bad at all.  I just think guidance should be more gender neutral in terms of life in general AND most importantly I think said guidance should have a spot for ""if this guidance isn't working then here are other resources and support.""  I'm behind guidance, but I think the guidance needs to be more empathetic to those who fall outside of the ""men man up"" and ""women are kind at all costs.""  I have spent many years working with the mental health community and I can tell you where that can lead.  To men who would rather kill themselves or become addicts than discuss a problem with someone because then they feel like a failure as a man.  To men who finally decide to seek help and then beat themselves up in anger daily for failing to meet the masculine standard.  To women who are terrified to have an opinion on anything because ""I don't want to impose on anyone.""  To women who fear saying ""no"" to even simple things because it might not be nice and women are nice.

Here's my perspective.  I do love being a woman.  I love dresses and feminine things.  Appearance wise I love all things feminine.  However I see the crap that those who don't get and I don't think thats' right.  On the opposite end, I didn't get the ""be nice at all costs"" deal.  I tend to be on the assertive end of the spectrum.  In some areas that has helped me.  In some it has been clear that it's too outside of the ""docile woman"" spectrum.

I think people should pick and choose what works for them.  I don't think they should be hit with a society hammer that says it's not okay to do this or be this based on gender.  

I also am of the opinion, this one just based on my own thoughts, that having ""women do this"" and ""men do this"" standards tends to fuel the gender wars.  I'm pretty fed up with the us vs them gender problems.  I'm sick of things having to like that.  I wish we could all just see each other as people and be helpful to each other based on that alone.  It makes me sad to see women who hate men and men who hate women.  It makes me sad when each group refuses to see the other group has issues.  It makes me sad to see people pushing for greater gender divides to ""solve"" these issues.  We are people.  Hostility won't fix the issues there are.  But, as I've said elsewhere, I'm just me.  I can't fix large scale problems.  I do work often with people within the mental health framework though and I know ""you can get help and be a man"" and ""you can stand up for yourself and be a woman"" gets said more than it should have to be."

PainShake,magicTCG,1389454757.0,"I think we're both wrong.  It's hyperbolic.

Let's say they start at 0 life.  The Mirror would have them gain 20 life as part of the action ""set your life total to 20.""  Rain of Gore makes them lose 20 life instead.

They are at -20.  The Mirror would have them gain 40 life.  Rain of Gore makes them lose 40 instead.

It's a little to early in the morning for me to find the equation here, but these are the first few values:

0
-20
-60
-140
-300
-620

MarkMcGuinness,india,1389454768.0,"I'm atheist too. But let me ask this. Do/did Europeans believe in Greek mythology? In Roman myths? In Egyptian ones? 

No. But, they took lessons from them anyway. They used them as poetic/literary themes, and they formed an essential part of European cultural heritage, especially Greek and Roman myths. They used them as motifs, as cultural symbols, as metaphors.

These aren't prescriptive religious scripture like the Bible - they're called *epics* for a reason. They're more akin to the Iliad, the Odyssey, etc.

Why is it either believe or totally disown? Not believing doesn't mean totally disowning. You can still read it as stories, and Indian mythology is an undeniable collective South Asian cultural heritage. "

His random attitude would work to his advantage to give the audience a constant laugh, and his TARDIS would allow him to speak to anyone who spoke another language. One other thing he could do is randomly bring a sentient alien life form from another planet/time and interview it, possibly allowing some other well known figure from earth to join in (e.g., political figure, scientist, etc).

He **is** negotiating back with you.  If he wasn't, you'd be in court right now, and then you'd have a judgment, and he could just come and take your property to satisfy that judgment.  

&gt;I want you to understand that I need to be able to take care of myself. I need to have some money left over in case something happens to me or there's an emergency.

You mean an emergency like some irresponsible person damages your property or hurts you and doesn't have insurance to pay for it?  That kind of emergency?

&gt;I don't want to be nickeled and dimed for everything I own in order to satisfy a lust for money.

This isn't a lust for money.  It's you owing them money, and them being gracious enough not to just come and take your shit with a Sheriff standing by, in order to rectify the problem.

&gt;I'm willing to make payments amd they're not satisfied with the fact that it's going to take longer than they want it to.

The instant you drove that car without insurance, your payment was overdue.  Why should someone else have to front you money for your irresponsibility?  You're not responsible enough to have insurance, why would anyone agree that you're responsible enough to make payments in a timely fashion?

&gt;But I can't give away the rest of the little amount of money I'll have left over each month. 

You have to.  You said you're saving for an emergency?  This is an emergency.  This is what emergency funds are for.

&gt;I didn't ignore it like most people would.

Anyone who ignored it would be in court right now.  That's what you're not understanding.  Your options are not (1) pay a few pennies and maintain my comfortable ""padding"" on my expenses each month, or (2) pay way too much ZOMG too much.  Your options are (1) make the payments they want you to pay, or (2) a Judge gives them an order to come and take your belongings until they have sold them for enough money to cover your debt."

It's a debate, and earns equal effort in response if it's worth responding to at all.

If no one here put any effort out to explain themselves because they some how believe their argument is inherit of reality, no one would could move forward and it becomes a perpetual circle jerk of mere opinion.

(Where we are referring to one general point in the argument I made, the situation as a whole is confounded because the discussion keeps getting moved to addressing points I never attempted or intended to make.)

Anyway, I appreciate your honest input as my electrical expertise outside of computers is limited to home electrical installation and welding, not engineering; so these details are important...

This is why I can't move forward on that topic because it's the parties duty to provide a good argument for their case in question.

I'm taking this seriously, as I understand I'm not just talking to some desperate kid who wants to argue because his pride is hurt or disagrees based off of bias.

I just ask that careful attention is made to details, and to not address arguments that I did not intend.

Your worst case scenario is bankruptcy, in which case you can probably shelter all of your net worth.  Best case is rapidly accelerated retirement.

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1389455280.0,"Sex is an issue people get very passionate about, politically, and I do have to say it is ""cool"" to be in to casual sex nowadays.  So I do think you have a point in saying that it is unpopular to believe you want to have sex with someone you love.  I believe in the same thing, I'm 26f, and have definitely gotten flack for what is seen as a ""conservative, traditionalist view"".  I do live in a big city, but even in colleges in the middle of nowhere, hook up culture is the prevailing norm.  People are very big about pushing casual sex, I think, because they are the backlash to the previously held traditional view, most likely spouted by their parents - you should have sex with someone you love.

People on both sides of the issue can be assholes about it, doesn't matter which belief they hold....I've certainly met pushy jerks who look down on those who have casual sex, and I've certainly met a lot of people (perhaps it seems like more because I hold a similar belief to you, OP, so it runs against their grain) who express extreme distaste at the thought of love before sex.  Try not to let it get to you...there is nothing wrong with your opinion, but people will jump down your throat for having ANY opinion that is not the same as theirs.

None of this refutes what I'm saying and the author is even more or less saying what I was at the end!

&gt;As stated earlier, these statistics were not designed for this purpose, and statistics typically have to be designed for a purpose in order to be reliable for that purpose. There are factors which might make numbers such as ""28%"" higher than the real non-paternity rate, and some which might make them too low. No one knows the real non-paternity rate for this sub-population. And, as shown above, sometimes, no one has been misled, and sometimes there is no fraud. These statistics simply provide little or no prediction for paternity fraud.

This isn't looking like a very good argument. I have seen the various summaries of the studies present on the second link before and they more supports the possibility of a quite high (20-30%) rate.

Bottom line is that this is a serious enough problem that any man should test no matter what, especially given the legal system's refusal to render just verdicts in these cases. Even the oft-quoted 10% by most is insanely high when you consider how big populations are."

To figure out where you are on the shallow vs. projected spectrum, here is a [diagram](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hnIpeGDU2WE/UEYGVHZOCgI/AAAAAAAAA20/AkCVXUtLzcE/s1600/shallow+breasts.jpg) that shows what the side profile of a shallow breast looks like. [This NSFW visual](http://i.imgur.com/N8mnDf0.jpg) has women with the safe cup size, but places them on the shallow/projected spectrum so that it is easier to visualize within a cupsize. And we also have the [shallow breast guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/wiki/shallow). Hopefully those point you in the right direction, and once you start trying on bras, you'll be able to narrow things down!

As far as fullness, breasts can be full on top, even, or full on bottom. [This visual[(http://i.imgur.com/zeP3dZF.png) is really helpful. Standing in profile in front of a mirror, cup your breast as thought you are supporting it like a bra, and find the shape that most matches yours.

For roots, I suggest standing without a bra on in front of a mirror and bending over so you're at a ~90 degree angle. Your breast tissue will succumb to gravity, and if you have wide roots, it will look like the lateral portion of your breasts are coming from your sides. Otherwise they will come from your chest wall, and you have an average or narrow root.

1.  I'm thinking about it!  I haven't decided yet what I want to do, but it's a definite possibility.

2. I've thought about this also, but I don't want to do a P90X hybrid and not  know P90X.  I want to do the program once before I start hybriding it.

3. I'm a little scared of Body Beast.  Plus, I don't know if I have all of the equipment necessary (I do have an impressive dumbbell collection though!

4. I hate gyms.  Seriously.  It might be my area (Ft. Lauderdale, FL), but there are so many meat heads and bros at the gym who love to give their input about what you could be doing better.  Last time I was at the gym, I also had no idea what to do.  It might be better if I had a trainer to get me a routine, but I'm very routine oriented. Also, I saw a thing with Tony where he said something like gyms are inefficient, because the machines usually only work out a few muscles at a time.  His (and Shaun's) programs work out several muscle groups at once and can give you quicker results.  

Thanks for the input, I really want this to be the year I shake my gut, so I'm not sure how I want to go around this.  Also, for financials, I can borrow P90X from a friend before I buy it.  I usually borrow the workout first, then try it.

&gt;Getting me to agree that 1% is possible is not a step toward getting me to agree that 100% is remotely plausible.

I was just clearing things up we both agree that there will be inflationary pressure, we only disagree at what point it will stop.

&gt;Any increase always has to be some small fraction of X.

There is no such rule

&gt;income is currently equal to the BIG amount,

no, I believe people are spending much less in the present than they will spend after the being given the basic income,

numbers are arbitrary in this case you really can't quantify basic needs, but I'll use them to argue my point:

 if they currently cover 70% of their basic needs, wich will abstract as Y utility. after implementing the basic income they will have all of those needs met 100% of y*. However as months pass because of that inflationary pressure Y becomes more expensive so that basic income covers on 95% of Y and so on, is in that inconceivable that within a year, or maybe 2 the benefit will be erased.

goundo,AskReddit,1389456075.0,"Yep. I was a pretty sad kid. Everyone talks about how kids are so joyous an carefree, but for me, it was certainly not true. My parents weren't abusive, paid all their bills on time, and hardly drank. For a long time, I blamed my parents for me having an unhappy childhood, because of such-and-such reason. But what the fuck are you supposed to do when your kid hardly talks to you, let alone other kids; when he is so lazy that you constantly have to physically force him to do anything but watch tv? And how the hell is a kid supposed to pull himself up by his own bootstraps, and put enormous amounts of effort into improving himself, when he can't even conceptualize what that improvement is?

In the end, I've realized that my unhappy childhood was just a product of random chance. If things had been different, maybe I would have fond memories of my childhood. But they weren't, and I just have to accept that and move on."

Death penalty in that sense is not a reflection of the inhumanity of the sentenced but of our inability to deal with his disease in a truly humane and compassionate way. So I believe we should stop killing criminals until we find a way to cure their diseases. Also the threshold for what is punishable by death is largely subjective and I believe it's self deluding to think American laws are more fair in that regard than say some Islamic countries laws even though they obviously are. The most sensible law is one without death penalty.

thendrill,Bitcoin,1389456556.0,"The inherent problem of the bitcoin p2p protocol is that if a node has 51% or more of the computing power of the total mining network then it can generate pay transactions without actually them being valid but if 51% of the network says they are valid the rest of the network will validate them. 

In simple terms. If a pool has 51% or more of the hashing power then it can generate unlimited amount of coins. That would void the whole point of bitcoin, people will lose faith in bitcoin and the price is going to go down down down.... 

So that is why in every miners interest for that not to happen. When a pool reaches 51% people will move away from that pool to keep the security of the network and coin price. "
Skeetrap,DecidingToBeBetter,1389456557.0,"A former coworker of mine went to AA twice a week for the entire time I knew him, because he had a similar problem to yours. He would only drink on payday, but he sometimes spent half of his check on booze and drank himself into oblivion, not because he enjoyed it, but because that was the habit that he had been in for a rather long time.

AA is not for everyone, but it does help some people. There is a ""spiritual"" aspect of it that not everyone is comfortable with, but if you are capable of giving yourself up to a higher power (doesn't need to be a religion, could be anything greater than yourself), meetings can be a place to realize that you are not alone and there are others striving for the same goals you are.

If attending weekly meetings are not possible or desirable to you, substituting a different habit for the binge drinking may be the solution. Instead of going out to the bars or getting a bottle on Friday night, look for things to do that remove you from the act of drinking. My coworker believed that some people simply have addictive personalities, and are inherently susceptible to forming bad habits. Replacing a destructive tendency with a constructive one will not only decrease the danger you are in, but it will help to kick-start your progress towards your other, higher goals.

I hope some of this has helped you come to terms with your alcoholism. Binge drinking is alcoholism, but your understanding that it is a negative aspect of your life is the first step of a long journey of self-awareness. I'm confident you will prevail, it's just a matter of deciding what road to take."

The game looked good for its time but it benefits from a less-than-realistic art style.  The problem that most games have is that they try being too realistic so they don't look as good in 5-10 years.

I was in a similar boat. I gained an appreciation by just being patient and watching a ton of older films. Like you, my girlfriend at the time wanted to show me the value of older films, so we ended up watching a lot together. I didn't really realize I was actually gaining an appreciation until I started watching more modern films again. And it wasn't that I liked the modern films more or less, I just had this sense of depth now. I started to pick up on references and structural/styling choices. My entire viewing experience became much richer. If you like Tarantino you'll like him even more once you realize how ridiculously chalk-full of references his films are. His films are a lot of fun because he'll add the most innocuous little detail for no other reason than as an homage to some film he likes.

I'd also suggest reading on wikipedia about the visual language used in films. It seems obvious, but a lot of times we forget that films are a visual art medium and that when a good director puts something in a shot it's there for a reason. So it becomes like a little treasure hunt, what subtle clues can I find in each shot that will give me a better understanding of the story and it's characters? An example would be someone looking at someone else through a mirror, causing them to appear twice on the screen, implying that have ulterior motives or hidden thoughts. In older movies this kind of ""visual vocabulary"" is used in a much different way than today. Many older films are much more tightly constructed, like watching a play with acts and strictly blocked movement. This might be what puts you off to old styles of cinema, since it can come off as stilted to our modern sensibilities at first. But the more you watch the more you appreciate how meticulous some films were in their construction. 

As others have pointed out, since films started out as a silent medium, their initial traditions were rooted in theater and painting where things like light, composition, and gesture were the most important aspects for telling a story. Over time, with the addition of sound and color, these traditions have changed, but at a cost of sorts. The modern audience literally doesn't look at a film in the same way an earlier audience would have, so you have to train yourself to see what's there. And the best way I've found to do that is simply by watching lots of movies.

Take away: Watch a lot of old movies, you might not like them all but you'll enjoy film in general on a much deeper level (maybe)."

wh1skeyk1ng,AskReddit,1389456984.0,"I had fell asleep driving home from work with a friend/co-worker one night and rolled my car into a shallow creek.  I came to consciousness upside down, head under water, with my seat belt still on, and the air bag siren going off.  I had no clue what the hell was going on.  I wrestled to find the seat belt release so I could breathe, and got myself upright with my head above water.  I yelled for my friend, who responded but I could not see him in the darkness.  I remembered that I had a flashlight in my pocket that I used at work that day, so I located it and by the grace of all that is holy, it turned on.  I tried getting my door open but to no avail.  It was a cold 40F degree night, the snow had just finished melting that week, and my friend and I were trapped inside the car in frigid water.  This is when I thought we were both going to die.

 He couldn't get his door open either, but managed to find that one of the rear windows was broken out and informed me that he was going to have to swim under water to get out.  He did so, and yelled for me to do it too once he got outside the car and was standing in the creek bed.  I got out, and we managed to trudge a half mile down the road soaked from head to toe, to a farm house and got help.  "

ianp622,AskMen,1389456999.0,"You can learn how to identify the signs. What you need:
First you need a baseline, so look for girls that you know are not interested in you. Pay attention to their mannerisms - that means eye contact, smiling, how good your jokes are before they laugh at them, and physical contact (but also take into account their friendliness and the justifiability of the physical contact - did it seem totally unnecessary or was it expected in the given situation?) Body language is also important - her grabbing her arm or crossing her arms shows disinterest. 

Now, if there is a particular girl you want to know about, you need to see what her range of flirtiness is. So look for groups of mixed guys and girls. Pay attention to how the girl interacts with the group. Is she touchy with everyone? Does she laugh at everyone's bad jokes equally or only yours? 

If it's just you and the girl, consider the likelihood of your encounter assuming she's not interested. Did she go out of her way to engage you? Were there other people and she singled you out?

If you're more mathematically inclined, you're trying to determine the likelihood of the girl being interested in you given her behavior. If we take L being she is interested in you, and B given her particular behavior state, we have the equation P(L|B) = ( P(B|L)P(L) ) / P(B). So when you identify the range of her behavior among a mix of people she has varying levels of interest in, that's P(B). P(L) is the probability of her liking you without taking into account her behavior (so your attractiveness and her preferences). P(B|L) is where you need to use your baseline, so you can find the probability of her behavior both when she is interested, and when she is not. Of course, this is the most difficult part.

What this model shows is that if she is generally flirty (P(B) is high), then it's less likely she is actually flirting with you. That's why the separate situations are helpful."

ViddySense,AskMen,1389457524.0,"So this happened a few months ago with a cute red head I work with. We had always been fairly talkative but on a slow day at work I just randomly text her ""Hey :D"" while standing next to her before I had to go and take care of something elsewhere. Moments late she shows up and say ""I don't want to do this back and forth thing. I like you but I just don't like long hair on guys."" We talked about it briefly and it ended with me telling her that I grow my hair out to donate from time to time and that I wasn't cutting it until it was ready to donate, it was almost time any ways.  


A few weeks after this I had a hard time falling asleep and was watching some shows at my PC when I get a text out of no where at 4:30 in the morning from her wanting to know if I still awake. When I responded she followed up with if I was interested in having sex. Briefly talk about it and determine it's actually too late for that since it would have been about a 15-20 minute drive for us both and neither of us really want to leave out apartments.  
A week later I end up passing out early for the night and wake the next morning to see a text if I was awake and two missed calls. We worked together that day and make mention of it and asked why she had called and get told it was for the same reason as the week before. I let her know we could do something that night and then it happens....  

""Oh, I see you more of as a brother.""

...

WAT!? I'm absolutely dumbfounded by this. I just stand there smiling and say ""yeah, whatever."" and thus ensues the awkward silence between us at work."

A woman's sex drive is more complex than a man's, we get an aching urge to just blow a load whereas a woman's is much more situational. At a young age a girl (18-22 etc) will feel the horniness of a man (albeit to a lesser degree) but her harem of beta orbiters willing to do shit for her and the bounty of Alpha cock available to her means that her body doesn't need to give it out as much, she'll only really get wet for the absolute best men. As a woman ages she loses this power, her natural beauty, so he body has to be prepared to give more, so she wants to fuck more, because that's what she needs to do if she wants even 40% of the power she once had. Remember this stuff is generally subconcious.

It's hard to directly respond to your question as I can't imagine Brits migrating to Poland to do low paid jobs and thus can't answer you what possible views of native people there would be, based on those facts.

If I was to say that Poland was in the same position as UK (rich, with high demand on low skilled labour) some people will obviously always moan but most would be happy that there is someone who is willing to do work which native isn't interested in - just using this one reason."

Ages were mildly relevant but this other stuff isn't.  You're not gonna guilt trip me into saying whatever you want to hear.  Let's keep going.

&gt;Basically we've been dating for 8 months. A few months ago she moved in with me in another state. Before this she was struggling to pay her way through school and was living with four other roommates, all with a dead end (albeit steady) job.

So she CHOSE to move in with you, right? Let's see what the terms were on this one and...

&gt;I told her she didn't have to work...

Sorry to have to be the one that tells you, but you're an idiot.  That's fine, we can work around it.  But really why did you offer to pay for both her and yourself?  You're not adopting a little kid, it's a relationship between two (hopefully) capable adults.

&gt;Which I now regret.

I bet.  Now lets get to the great moral quandary here.

&gt;I don't know what I've gotten myself into with this. Her family was abusive so she can't go to them, and she isn't really qualified for a professional job. Even if she found something and managed to find roommates, she'd still need somewhere to stay while saving money.

Once again, you tried but you won't guilt trip me into going soft on you.  I'm not sure what makes her not qualified for a professional job, but everything there forward is a lot of her own personal problems.  You do not owe her anything.

&gt; The only choices I have here are to kick her out, stay with her out of guilt, or make her a roommate while she saves money.

Don't stay with anyone out of guilt.  So now we're down to giving her the boot and an awkward (for her) living situation.  Which you shouldn't care about because life's too short to have to worry about if you're making someone else feel a little awkward while you're providing them shelter. You don't owe her anything.

&gt;The logical choice would be to make her a temporary roommate, but I know it would break her heart to see me bringing other girls in and out.

And this is where she's gotta go.  If you can't live your own life the way that would make you happy because of someone else you're not even in a relationship with (that's  NOT a child) something has to change.

&gt; I feel like a dick because she cooks and cleans for me 

You feel like a dick because she kind of contributes while you're financing her life?  Come on, man. You don't owe her anything.

&gt;Now I have to break it for my own happiness.

But wait!  There's this tiny little beacon of hope!  I THINK HE GETS IT!!!

TL;DR read it.  I broke it up into segments so I could regurgitate it into your mind-mouth for easy digestion."

dbanano,AskWomen,1389458000.0,"I have the hormonal IUD and I've had it for about 2.5 months. I've had two-three days of spotting since I got it. Before that I was on the pill for 5-6 years. To be fair, I almost never got my period while I was on the pill (even low-dose ones), so I may not be the best example.

I haven't seen/felt any hormonal changes. My doctor said that for 80% of women the hormones stay in your uterus, meaning those women don't get the side effects of normal birth control pills. I never had trouble with the pills though so I'm not sure. My doctor also told me that once it's out, there should be no change in possible fertility. I have seen no real difference in my weight or hunger or anything.

One thing I really like is knowing for sure that the hormones are there and not having to worry about pregnancy. I never had a problem with the pill but I still felt like there was so much possibility for human error that I was constantly kind of afraid of getting pregnant (to be fair, I'm a huge hypochondriac). I also really love not having to worry about when I'm running out of birth control, etc.

My only warning would be that it is extremely painful to have put in. Like, my doctor told me that and i still could not believe how bad it hurt. The good news is, that was about two minutes of pain, followed by like 20 mins of me feeling like I was going to pass out, and then I've had absolutely no problems. My doctor mentioned that some women, especially with small uteruses (i.e. me) say they can ""feel"" the mirena, but that never happened to me. My boyfriend said he thought he felt it one time while we had sex but that was like a week after I got it."

The hood pins are not just for weight, but are also for reliability/durability/security. Two pins do a better job holding the hood down in unusual circumstances than one latch (even if the latch has a redundant mechanism, as cars do). Some hoods have four pins, one at each corner, and lift right off instead of having hinges.

That is *supremely fucked up*.

That shit will only stop once we stop doing this to boys.  If Jews want to do because its a religious thing, we'll whatever (that wouldn't fly as justification for FGM, but hey, I'm used to double standards that only harm men being ignored), but this ""health reasons"" fucking nonsense has to stop.  Teach boys to wash their dicks and use protection, for fuck's sake."

flyingcatpotato,AskWomen,1389458532.0,"I dropped out of grad school to marry my ex husband.  That's the context. This isn't justice porn but more karma porn.

His long-term mistress is one of those people who has gotten a lot of breaks in her life thanks to looks.  One particular lie on her cv is that she speaks five languages.  She speaks three, and the third, English, she does not speak well. At her job, she is supposed to speak English but my ex and the other people she was sleeping with wound up doing all her higher level work and her looks made up for the rest.

One of the things they both told me when i confronted them is that i was not ambitious or pretty enough for my ex and that one of the things he really liked her is that she was going to do this prestigious MBA program in English and that she spoke more languages than me. He had the fucking nerve to bring up my lack of education when i dropped out of grad school at a top tier school to marry him.

Karma was on my side, because she didn't get accepted into any of her top schools because her English was too shitty. Furthermore, her employer just started a round of layoffs and her looks didn't save her this time. My ex got fired for sleeping with her because she was a colleague (because that way he wasn't in the official layoff figures). The stress broke them up because if he couldn't pay for stuff she needed to find a dude who would. So now she has no MBA and no job.

Meanwhile i have a great job, have just passed a government test in one of her languages, and have am amazing boyfriend who still has a job. Her arrogance did me a favor!"

goundo,funny,1389458550.0,"I've seen, with my own eyes, an eye-spliced static kernmantle rope, which was then able to hold a load probably in excess of 6000 lbs. If only the sheath had been spliced, the rope would have definitely ripped under that much tension. While I've never personally spliced a kernmantle rope, I imagine the process goes like: unravel the sheath down to where the bottom of your splice will be; splice the core with itself; reweave the sheath around the core; splice the sheath. While this would work with an eye or short splice, if you want to make a back splice, you might as well just take a hot knife and fuse the end - a lot less work, and the same effect.

Climbing ropes are most often made of nylon, not just ""plastic"".

And while the sheath's main purpose is to protect the core, IIRC, it still provides about 10% of the rope's total strength. 

And that is definitely not a climbing rope. Maybe it could be a haul line, but it looks static (and probably is - who wants to climb 10 feet up their grappling hook line before they leave the ground?), so there is no way I'd use it as a lead line if I had any other choice. More evidence against it being a lead line is the thin diameter (though I suppose it could be a twin rope), and the thick bunches the fibers of the sheath are in. I would use it to rap in a pinch though.

My guess is that the company that makes the hooks just got some rope that can hold body weight. If you are going hand over hand with no safety gear, like I assume most of their customers will do, the company is probably better off hiring good liability lawyers than investing in UIAA or CEN certified rope. I could be wrong though."

Dantilli,IWantToLearn,1389458970.0,"/u/SkyPilotOne gives great advice if you're wanting to learn mathematical logic without actually studying mathematics. 

But to actually THINK logically getting into philosophy is the easiest way. The whole point of philosophy is to look at an argument and analyse is through pure logic. Technically this is still mathematics, but it's an abstract application of it that helps you to apply logic to, well, everything. It is literally logic in it's purest form.

This also kind of teaches you to think outside the box, but not exactly. It more teaches you how to define exactly how big the box is based on the facts you have on hand. Most of the time this box is bigger than it seems to a casual observer hence it seems like you're thinking ""outside the box"". When in reality you're just expanding your box to fit the situation. You're just thinking outside THEIR box. Does that make sense?

As for how to get into philosophy I'm not too sure (I have friends studying it and constantly have philosophical conversations with them), try googling for it. Or maybe ask the queston on this subreddit. If you're really lucky maybe a really kind person will reply to this and help you out."

I mean, the fucked up thing is she probably would have drowned if you hadn't rescued her, but now she is going to drown and it'll be kind of your fault.  If you had just let her sink in the first place, your hands would be clean now.

1) He's been hurt more than she has and is still vulnerable. And going beyond that, he is proactive about trying to help mend her heart.

2) He probably didn't mend his own heart. So, he has had others mend it, as he is doing for her.

Kind of gives a bit of perspective to how humans go from relationship to relationship and every interaction we have with others is affected by the interactions that came before it.

Well that weekend I was in Pennsylvania with family anf my mom's cousin had tickets to Kristin's last performance. She got the tickets before the date was announced and she didn't know about the last performance. She noticed I was obsessed and the next morning - which was the day of the performance - she offers me and my mother her tickets. I was ecstatic! We headed home in ny, got dressed and headed for the theatre. It was the greatest audience I've ever been a part of. There were about 5 standing ovations throughout the show and the actors were changing the dialogue. Kristin also did a special version of ""Popular"". When the show was over my dad met with us and was waiting at the stage door and got me an autograph of Kristin Chenoweth, Idina Menzel and Joel Grey. It was pretty amazing. "

I even enjoyed the fan service in the manga because it was part of the humor.

How excited was I when I heard there was going to be an anime. Low and behold I was utterly disappointed. The animation and art were great. The voice actors and music were fine. The story was still the same but I just couldn't enjoy watching it because the amount of fan service was just too high. The fan service just eclipse everything else in the show. That didn't mean that I couldn't still watch it and enjoy it. It meant that if I wanted to watch it and enjoy it I had to force myself to and doing that wasn't worth the effort."

shalashaskatoka,AskMen,1389459369.0,"Look, here is the issue. Its not that you are a bad person per-say, but what you want is a raw deal for men. You use your $100k a year job as a measuring stick for men to measure up to for having the *privilege* of having increased bills, more responsibilities , and more liabilities. If your ideal man was as utilitarian as you are when it  comes to selecting mates, you seem like a: Drain on resources since you quit your job, more so since you spawned kids, more so because those kids need more expensive health insurance plans, clothes, schooling, college, etc.And to top it all off, you are one of the largest threats to my ""empire"" through divorce litigation. I'm sorry, but the ""power men"" you are looking for live "" high speed, low drag"" lives that allow them to  excel. You are the maximum level of drag out there. Now if you wanted to keep your job and have kids,you seem more appealing. More so if you drop the kids.But in general, ambitious men don't want or seek out mates for families since they don't have the time to be a father. Yes, being a father takes time. I need to be there for my son just like you need to be there for your daughter. Even if you had 2 boys or 2 girls, the girls need daddy and the boys need mommy too.  
  
Its not that you are threatening, its just that you are not as great a catch as you think you are. Lets look at it straight out. In your ideal situation here is the stack up.  
  
Man: $150k year salary, stock options, room for advancement, car, house, investments, presents few legal risks to you.  
  
You: Retired, Spawned on average 2 kids, decent savings, no career advancement, no income, kids cost on average $241,000 over 18 years, so a HALF MILLION in expense(http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/14/pf/cost-children/), increased healthcare expenses, Severe legal risks through divorce.  
  
On paper, after you quit your job and have kids, you are not that great of a deal. In fact, if you swapped qualities and the man had the qualities I depicted under""You"", you wouldn't even look at the guy twice.  
  
What concerns me is that while you are very aware of the plight of men( And I commend you for your attention, thank you), you are seemingly unaware of exactly what you bring to the table in the dream relationship you desire. You start off like a shiny lamborghini with your good looks, $100k salary, and intelligence, but turn into an Acura when I drive you off the lot ( Marriage). An Acura still looks nice, but its not the same $300k+ car I bought in the dealership. You literally plan on becoming a different person after a guy commits to you. That is not ok. We know this as soon as you want kids and move the other way.  
  
Im 22, Just started a $50k+ year job and have connections. If I work hard, I have a shot of being something someday. However, Dating is hard since girls with goals like me are not looking for men. If I want girls, I have to look elsewhere. This means lowering expectations. Its a tough spot. Most people dont make $50k  before mid 20s. Just like many people dont make $100k at 30+.  
  
Plus, here is another analogy. Finding a nice mate is like finding a needle in a hay stack, but when you add qualifiers( Male, straight, $100k year job, Looking for you). You make the haystack smaller and the needle even smaller. At this point you are using a neutron microscope to find quark sized needles in a nano scale haystack. Its going to take time."

You don't get it back, because it doesn't matter. You move on with your life. From now on whenever you deal with her, you talk her to in an abrupt and impersonal manner, as you would any other co-worker. Treat her like a business partner and nothing more.  You have a life and important things to do with your time. You're not interested in this woman, after what she did to you (even though you brought it on yourself, but nevertheless she still disrespected you).

She'll sense that you no longer care about her and have moved on to bigger and better things. Ironically, by not trying to get her respect back, you may eventually earn her respect. But that doesn't matter, because this girl and her opinion of you doesn't matter.

&gt;In 1913, young Chicago chemist Thomas Williams had a dilemma. His older sister, Maybel, was in love with a man who was in love with someone else. Maybel Williams did her best with what was available—she used petroleum jelly on her lashes and brows to enhance them. Her brother decided to help her increase her allure by adding carbon dust to the petroleum jelly, which darkened her lashes and brows more dramatically. The product worked. In 1915, Maybel got her man and Thomas founded what would become the global industry giant, Maybelline, named after the bride and her favourite beauty aid.

As someone who was circumcised mostly because the doctor convinced my mother to do for the health reasons, I'm generally anti-circumcision.  I mean, it's a naturally-occurring body part. It has to have some kind of purpose; that's ignoring all of the studies that have shown that it actually does serve a bunch of purposes. The cleanliness argument doesn't make sense since there are all kinds of holes and crevices in the human body that can get infected if you don't clean them regularly.

If I do have depression, it is a mild form, since I've read stories about what depression feels like to people who have been diagnosed with it, and I feel like I mostly just wanted to turn my brain off and let it go numb (hence the tv), while people with diagnosed depression can't muster the energy to turn on the lights when it gets dark.

I suppose I could see someone, and get an official diagnosis, but that would cost money. And while I'm by no means starving, I've found my own best coping mechanism in the outdoors. I'd rather spend my money on gas and gear so that I can see and interact with beautiful, amazing places.

Deandalecc,AskMen,1389459523.0,"There's only one woman I've ever been with that I would call crazy. Everything started out fine with her but I did notice fairly early on that we were moving really fast.

One day she calls me and says that she needs me to come over because she's bored and she misses me. I told her that I was at work and I couldn't, then she got really annoyed and gave me that ''fine!'' and hung up. That was red flag number one.

After a while she started having these really violent mood swings where she would be happy one second and then insanely pissed the next for seemingly no reason.

It all came to a head when one day she calls me at work again and says I need to come over. I told her I couldn't and she starts screaming that I don't love her and that she'll kill herself if I don't meet up with her. I spent the next half hour trying to calm her down on the phone and then right before she hung up she started laughing and saying ''wow I was pretty upset there for a second, talk to you later.''

I broke up with her about a week later and she threw a book at my head.  "

I've been burned so badly by panhandlers when I was trying to be nice that it has tainted me towards all of them. I've heard the ol' I need gas, I'm carrying a Jerry can crap only to see them again on a weekly basis at the same gas station (great business plan). I've pulled out my cash to hand a dollar, only to have my whole fold snatched out of my hand, while they run off. A good female friend of mine used to pass the same homeless person on the way to class every day so she decided to get the man a coffee and a sandwich. She handed them off to him only to have them thrown at her as she walked away, with an added ""Bitch!""

I'm sure there are good panhandlers out there, however my experiences have ruined that for me.

 

However, if a homeless man or woman wanted some food, I would buy it for them at the drop of a hat. If they were honest and said, damn man, I really need some smokes, I'd respect the honesty and buy them a pack. I just can't mess with cash anymore.

As other users suggested; starting from the ground up is really the way to start appreciating old films. I'd recommend watching The Trip to the Moon, and maybe Battleship Potemkin. And as you work up, you will start appreciating the warmth and fidelity of an old film, and it's great."

New media lets us choose to hear reporting about which topics are of interest to us.

Politics has become such a game of spin, optics, trying to shape the debate, and outright lies that people can't interpret political coverage anyway, and don't trust what they hear if it doesn't fit their mental image of how the world works.

My attempt at a concrete example:

It's a marketplace of ideas, and maybe I choose, for example, to not want to consume ideas about high-end sports cars. I'm sure sports car dealers would prefer that I did, but that doesn't change my interests. A sports car dealer saying ""hey, our V12 is actually a more green solution than any electric"" wouldn't ring true, even if I cared to read about how energy inefficient the production of car batteries is.

p3ndulum,PurplePillDebate,1389460077.0,"&gt; So you don't think scientific research in this area is valid because men and women are socialized differently?

Exactly. It's all relative.

Men are typically conditioned to have thicker skin through things like having their ""balls busted"" by their friends, and are no doubt physically disciplined far more aggressively than women are when they are children.

Boys roughhouse and engage in more risk-taking than girls, so they get hurt more often than girls do.

Boys are taught that ""men don't cry"", etc.

Sure, yes, there are physically active and aggressively-disciplined girls, but these things are heavily weighted towards boys and men.

For whatever reason, people hate to see girls and women cry, so they are more prone to having things sugar-coated for them, as we as having blame and responsibility lifted off of their shoulders. Their negative or unwanted behaviour is more likely to be excused.

They even wear high heels and make-up to make themselves look like delicate flowers - a ritual that starts as early as grade school for some of them.

Bottom line is that men and women, girls and boys, just simply don't experience the same levels and intensities, generally speaking.

So I think that in respect to their everyday experience women have a certain level of EQ that is fit for what gets thrown on their plate compared to other women just as men are equipped with their own spectrum in relation to the frequencies that are unique to their experience - but I don't think you can compare them to each other, respectively.

As an anecdotal example, I see this dynamic play out almost every time I get to see my niece and nephew.

My niece is an instigator and likes irritate her brother to the point where he begins to chase her. Almost immediately he gets scolded for being too aggressive with her, or for just simply getting out of hand, all while his sister gets scooped up into the arms of a parent or adult and asked ""aww, is your brother being mean to you?""

He bares all of the responsibility and is expected to grow a thicker skin and she gets coddled and protected from her owns manifestations.

And no, I don't have any scientific research paper to back me up.

Ha. Imagine what might happen if somebody published a paper that suggested that women might actually have it easier than men, or that they are actually treated preferentially..."

To me it seems like you're letting the opinions of other people take control of your thinking, and you have to learn to master your own thoughts. Yes, people will be mean. Yes, you will have a hard time in high school. Everyone does. 

Just know that you are in *absolute* control of your reactions to things, your thoughts, and your attitude. It's a difficult thing to master, but controlling your mental self is a step in the right direction. You *are* capable of ending your nervousness, but you have to realize your capabilities before you can start acting with them.

Earth is not special at all by composition or available resources. Anything that an alien species would want from earth is abundant in the entire universe. Anything they would want they would mine/gather from nearby (as we will someday probably mine asteroids and other planes/moons in our solar system). Coming all the way here for that is an inefficient expenditure of energy.

As for colonizing, the earth just has a random set of environmental conditions, the only aspect that might be remarkable is allowing for liquid water. Liquid water is not present on all planets, but from a practical point of view planets with liquid water are still in endless supply. Farther than that there's no indication if any form of evolved alien life would be able to survive, much less so thrive, on Earth. For example our 20% oxygen atmosphere might be too much, too little, or the oxygen might be completely irrelevant and they would need something else. Most creatures alive today would not fare well in earth's distant past and the differences are comparatively tiny to what native conditions extraterrestrials might have.

We might have a nice conversations about math and physics, exchange some technology, but an invasion is out of the question for the simple fact that there's nothing to invade us for."

If it's a platonic thing, I would encourage you to take the leap. The older you get, the more difficult it can be to establish friendships with new people.

And what I meant was that if things don't go well for you when you hang out with him, you can revert back to avoiding him or finding a way to be direct and honest with him about your position - whatever strategy you feel comfortable with to avoid having to hang out with him again.

Original course: trying to befriend this guy and hang out with him.

Changing course: looking for someone else to be friends with.

Really though, it seems to me like you're projecting a lack of confidence in yourself to be interesting when you say that you get ""that feeling"". 

If you are expecting things to not go well, it could be creating a feeling of stress based on expectations alone. It's what keeps people from doing all kinds of new things that may or may not actually be satisfying for them.

Of course cancer was the cause of death, but if that doctor actually tried to perform more tests and not just assume it wasn't necessary because she is old and it's normal for old people to have certain problems, it may have saved her life. It's not a trivial mistake, it's a question of caring enough for your patients to check all possible threats to their lives regardless of age.

Yes, she may have been alive if she didn't have cancer, but she also may have been alive if the cancer was discovered sooner. That's also a fact.

Edit: Death is absolutely inevitable and I completely accept it as a part of life, but that doesn't mean that carelessness of medical staff can't speed up the process where it was their job to help save a life. "

RandianHero,obama,1389461093.0,"If it wasn't governments, hegemony, and civilization as the norm, it'd be the law of the wild where civilians would die anyway. And while there's a certain appeal to having to scavenge, hunt, and even kill for my basic needs, that path is guaranteed to cause even more deaths than a few random people in the name of maintaining all the creature comforts you and I hold dear.

By the nature of people, we will always disagree. By the nature of civilization, those disagreements will usually not result in one of us dying. If a few people have to die elsewhere for that privilege, it's an acceptable loss. Is it tragic? No one is saying it isn't. Was it avoidable? Hard to say. Even during peacetime, people were dying in the name of protecting this strange idea we call America (and Canada, and the U.K., and Russia, and China, and *anyone* on the planet who lives in a country). People also die senselessly driving to work in the morning because someone didn't do a good job plowing the roads. Shit happens.

It's easy to be cynical about government and want to say, ""Fuck it all! I'm not taking part of it!"" That's your right as an American, and good on you for exercising your right. But that's also a very young, very emotional reaction that ultimately doesn't accomplish anything. Far be it for me to criticize what I once thought too before I got older and started seeing the bigger picture, so I'll just leave you with this: consider the alternatives. Not the ideal alternatives that television and comic book superheroes would have you believe, but the *actual* alternatives. Suddenly, First World politics don't seem so bad."

For instance, transmen often feels as though they get raging boners, their brain is mapped to have a penis. Transwomen often feel as though their penis does not belong as a part of their body. 

Men and women's brains differ in that some parts of the brain are different sizes. Research has shown that transmen, pre hormone therapy, have brains that more closely match that of a cis man. Same for transwomen- their brains more closely resemble the cis woman's brain. 

These people, when they realize it's an option, often undergo hormone therapy and gender corrective surgery to make their body match their brain. 

It's not that they can chose their gender, it's that they can chose to correct the mismatch between their brain and their body. 

Gender identity and sexuality are two completely different concepts. I'm not sure what you mean, exactly. "

Tombstone31,seduction,1389461301.0,"KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid. Picking up a girl isn't about doing 100 things well, it's about doing 5 things perfectly. Those 5 things are very fundamental: 

Rule 1: Be attractive;
Rule 2: Put yourself out there (i.e., open);
Rule 3: Be likeable; 
Rule 4: Be genuine;
Rule 5: Make moves

That's it. If you're not having success, there's a 100% chance you're doing one of those things wrong. Figure out which one(s), and fix it. 

For example, being a ""provider"" isn't a bad thing; it's a bad thing when girls feel like you're trying to buy your way into their pants. That's MANIPULATIVE behavior - which means you're not being genuine. 

You also mentioned escalating - notice that escalating isn't one of the 5 rules, making moves is. Escalating is one way to make moves, but it's not the only way. You can pick up girls without ever laying a hand on them, but you're going to have to reveal your interest (i.e., be genuine) in other ways, like through your words, and you're going to have to make moves in other ways, like through asking them out and asking for their phone number. You're going to have to physically escalate later, sure. But, while kino is helpful when meeting a girl, it isn't necessary."

Miliean,explainlikeimfive,1389461323.0,"Because advertising.  Google has realized that the competitive advantage in serving adds is serving the right add to the right person at the right time.  To do this they need information, massive amounts of information.

Every Google service is targeted at this.  Google maps is all about gathering information to serve local advertisements.  If you have Android just take a tour of Google Now to see how much they actually know.

But the one area of our lives that Google knows nothing about is our friendships.  That's the domain of Facebook and Facebook is capitalizing on that advantage in terms of advertising.  Google+ is Google's attempt to get that information for themselves, and it's failing. 

So Google thinks that if they force people to register for Google+ in order to use other Google services then they can get the information they want.  Problem is, it's those friendship connections that Google really wants, and there's no way to force people to take that step.

So Google has 2 choices.  Either Google to buys Facebook's information (and since that's all Facebook has it would be the equivalent of buying Facebook), but that would be super expensive.  Or to force enough people into Google+ that people start to make those friend connections.

Once Google+ reaches a critical mass of people then everyone will just have a Facebook AND a Google+ account, much like people have a Facebook AND a twitter account.  The friend connections won't all be the same but many of them will.  Enough that you can use that information to target adds. 

The most important to thing to remember to understand Google and anything they do is this.  If you don't pay for it, you're not the customer you're the product.  To Google you are the product and they are selling you to their actual customers, advertisers.  The better the product the more they can sell it for.  So to improve the product they need to know information about it."

Really it's all about organization.  Throw your clothes in a basket at the end of the day, keep your money in your wallet, and keep a trash can next to your desk.

With school, I find it's easy so long as you keep up with your classes.  Meet your deadlines and study every day after class.  

As for keeping a schedule...  You might be subjecting yourself to more stress than necessary.  There really shouldn't be a tight schedule beyond, ""wake up at 7, school at 8, study at 3, workout at 5, bedtime at 11.""  Of course your schedule is going to be different but I would NOT recommend keeping a minute by minute schedule.  Keep your daily routine simple, and flexible.

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389461781.0,"Okay, to understand this you have to understand there are three types of guys:  Group A is guys women want to have casual sexual relations with; Group B is guys women don't want to have casual sex with but do want to date/marry; and Group C is guys who need to pay women to touch their dicks.  Each group uses the word ""slut"" differently.

Group A uses the word ""slut"" to refer to women that want to have casual sex with them and that they want to have casual sex with. As in ""Let's go out and pick up some sluts down at the bar, and have a good time.""  These guys like sluts.  Don't respect 'em, but they like them.  This use of slut comes from the way women use the word; women declare other women sluts for not making sex scarce, and men perk up their ears and go ""So and so is a slut?  I want to meet her.""

When a man is having sex with a woman and calls her a slut, he is **always** speaking from Group A.  He always means it as a positive.

Group B uses the word ""slut"" to refer to women that want to have casual sex with Group A and not with them.  Sometimes they are bitter about this, and so slut might have a harsh edge on it. Most will begrudgingly admit that women have every right to pursue a sex life, but most feel some resentment at the way women make it clear that *they* are not suitable candidates for casual sex.

Group C uses the word ""slut"" to refer to all women everywhere who have sex, and *especially* the ones that enjoy it.  And they mean it in the most hateful way possible, because they are sad, bitter men.

When trying to understand how men use slang, it also always help to keep in mind that a man probably refers to his dudebros by such affectionate terms as ""those idiots,"" ""those cunts over there,"" ""this bunch of fuckstains over here,"" etc.  Men don't like to admit they like things, so instead they affectionately insult the things they like."

As for what feminism is still trying to do, as an example, is fight against the idea that a valid criticism of women speaking is that they aren't tactful enough to please others, and that women should attempt to address social problems in a more ingratiating way. 

It's so weird to me that you picked the word tactful there when effective works better.  It seems like you're objecting to women speaking when it's not for someone else's benefit.

danhakimi,leagueoflegends,1389461833.0,"Okay, so let's think of this in terms of mechanics. Is this a channel, or not?

The ones you listed (other than Maokai's ult), are all clearly not channels, but effects that work over time. Fiddle's ult channels before, but once it's out, it keeps going unless Fiddle dies.

Channels are all interrupted by... well, interrupts. And you (your champion) can't do *anything* during any channel, with a few exceptions. Take Kat's, MF's, Fiddle's, Janna's, and Nunu's ults as examples: you can't move, aa, hourglass, or do anything at all while channeling. The rare exceptions come from moves like Lucian's Ult, through which you can move by explicit exception.

There are un-interruptable channels, like Lux and Ez's ults: they will happen unless the champions die before the channel is over. A champion cannot move during the channel.

Moves like Swain's Ult, Karthus's Defile, and Amumu's despair,  Morgana's Ult and (I believe) Kennen's ult are not channels in any sense--the first three are plain toggles, and the last two are plain activated abilities. You can keep doing everything during those skills, use hourglass, and get interrupted. Nothing but death or running oom will stop these skills. I believe Maokai is in this category as well, but I can't remember seeing him with Zhonya.

In the middle, what do we have? Which moves are kind of channels and kind of not? Lucian's ult is a channel with an exception. So are Ez's and Lux's. But... are there any that aren't channels, but have channel-like qualities?

Anivia seems to be the one real outlier.

So the problem is not that she isn't balanced right now, but that her ult is unintuitive, unclear, and out of the ordinary. Riot fixes this kind of thing all the time--they set norms and lump things into more accessible categories. So if they can solve this too, they should.

So, what's the problem? Looking at Froggen's post on the surface... he lists a lot of numbers. If the problem is numbers, there is no problem -- lower the numbers, nerf Anivia, then buff her by making her make sense. Then she'll be balanced *and* make sense.

The real problem is not in numbers. The real problem is that if Anivia's ult can only be beaten by escaping it or killing/egging her, it's going to be uniquely frustrating no matter what the numbers are.

Because her ult has a decent radius, and slows, and because Anivia has a wall and a stun, it ends up being hard to escape. To balance this, you'd have to lower the radius, lower the slow, or at least increase the cooldown or lower the range. This is why it is altogether unlike Maokai's ult: Maokai's ult is kinda weak in that the teamfight might just slip away from it (and in that it has a low but non-negligble cooldown). It's good around turrets, at baron/dragon, and otherwise very limited.

The other option is killing Anivia. She's usually squishy (RoA isn't nothing), and the ult is pretty low range. But allowing Anivia to Hourglass for two seconds during her ult sort of ruins that option, too, doesn't it? She can save it until the rushed focus comes in on her, and then avoid significant burst. Then, she can take the next round of burst with her inevitable Seraph's Embrace active and/or RoA health.

So... we have a problem here that's *really* hard to fix.

I guess that's all I have to say."

girlfrodo,AskHistorians,1389461855.0,"I know that Lipton received his battlefield commission after the battle of Foy, although I realise this doesn't address the question of the sniper. I'm going to try and dig out the book. 


**Edit:** I can't find my copy of the book, but I had a look online and found an e-book box set on GoogleBooks titled ""From D-Day to Victory: Band of Brothers, D-Day, Pegasus Bridge"" (June 2013), which I guess is a compilation of Ambrose's writing. It's a limited preview but on searching for Powers' name, I found the following:

'[...] *as Speirs moved his men forward, and threatened to cut the road behind the German position, three Tiger tanks lumbered off, all that was left of the panzer company. A platoon or so of infantry got out with them. Some 100 Germans, mostly wounded, surrendered. Easy Company had won the test of will. It had taken Foy.*

*Lipton and Popeye Wynn looked at the place where the sniper had held them up, the one Powers shot at. They found the sniper with a bullet right in the middle of the forehead.*

""*You know,"" Wynn commented, ""it just doesn't pay to be shootin' at Shifty when he's got a rifle.*""'

It doesn't comment on the part with Lipton running out to draw the sniper's fire while Shifty took aim, but hopefully someone else in possession of the actual book may be along with an answer. "

As for Gen Y failing to launch:

The prospect of spending $120k+ on a degree that won't get us a job because we won't have 5 years of experience right out of the gate. Well paying jobs that lead to careers are hard to come by, and most people my age don't know how to prepare for and/or find them because we were all raised on the idea that you *must* graduate college to get a well paying job and that a degree is a guarantee of future employment. The people who don't continue their education after high school don't do much else (at least at first) because they haven't been informed of all of the other options and half the ones that do go to college dick around for 4 years and get a rude awakening when their degree doesn't mean shit and take the first job they can just to make rent or move back in with their parents. Meanwhile 2 years ago we watched thousands of unemployed/underemployed college grads camp out in parks across the country for months because of poor pay, lack of benefits, etc. Which kindof shattered the rosy picture of the future that growing up in the '90's painted for us. It's pretty easy to say ""well shit, I'm probably never going to surpass or even reach the same standard of living that I grew up in, so why bother trying, I'll just do what I need to do to get by and enjoy what pleasures I can have now"". 

As for why you and your friend can't find ""driven"" men of whatever age. It's probably because you're looking in the wrong places. The sorts of places where people usually go to find a boyfriend/girlfriend/hookup/partner/future spouse/etc. tend to cater to people who aren't doing much with their lives and have a lot of free time on their hands. I work and go to school full time and am working towards my commercial pilot's license, I wake up, go to the airport for a flight lesson, then work for the next 8 hours 5 days a week and spend the other 2 in class. I'm in the career path of my dreams and spend pretty much every waking hour working towards it, I'd consider myself ""driven"", but I'm not exactly the sort of person you'd find in a club or at the bar on a friday night. 

What about male coworkers around your age? Wouldn't they be considered successful, motivated men? Why the assumption that such people don't exist?"

TofuRobber,anime,1389461940.0,I think the fan service in the Monogatari series intentionally makes fun of typical fan service. It's usually done in a way that is obviously over the top but not in a way you'd usually see. The character's body aren't excessively sexualized. There are implied sexual moments in the show but it's not like in Fairytale where the female character's clothes always gets torn off for no good reason. It's not like Soul Eater where characters are created to solely be sexualize for the intent of fan service.
