ctesibius,unitedkingdom,1388876318.0,"My background is in comms security, mainly mobile data. I would be reasonably confident of being able to secure access if the data could only be reached on a small LAN. An example would be the control and provisioning interfaces for  RADIUS server in a secure hosting environment. In contrast, I would say that any data which can be reached  on more than quarter of a million nodes *cannot* be restricted to those nodes. Although for any given small physical area  of a hospital you can be sure to a high probability that no-one has put in a rogue router, an undocumented VPN, or remote desktop software, when you add together the whole size of the NHS network the probability that this has happened approaches unity. Even with no malicious intent, someone will have put in security breaches ""to get the job done"" - and with information this sensitive I'm sure that there are multiple parties with malicious intent.

Eagle-Eye-Smith,lebanon,1388876401.0,"Israeli here.

He was, at the very **least**, indirectly responsible for the massacre at Sabra and Shatila in 1982. The ""Kahan commission"", an Israeli commision that investigated the actions of the government at the time of the massacre, found that Sharon ""bears personal responsibility"" for the massacres, and that-

*The decision on the entry of the Phalangists into the refugee camps was taken without consideration of the danger - which the makers and executors of the decision were obligated to foresee as probable - the Phalangists would commit massacres and pogroms against the inhabitants of the camps, and without an examination of the means for preventing this danger.*

***Similarly, it is clear from the course of events that when the reports began to arrive about the actions of the Phalangists in the camps, no proper heed was taken of these reports, the correct conclusions were not drawn from them, and no energetic and immediate action were taken to restrain the Phalangists and put a stop to their actions.***

TL;DR- He knew a major massacre was about to happen, didn't do anything to prevent it beforehand in order to keep the trust of the Phalangists and didn't stop it even after he was explicitly informed that a massacre was occurring at the camps, essentially helping to facilitate the massacre."

I do think that smoking marijuana was harmful to your physical and mental health. 

I also think that every adult should be able to decide for themselves (wisely or poorly) what kind of intoxicant they prefer, and that we as a society need to understand that some people will become addicted and have measures in place for folks to quit, with help if necessary. 
Many people need help to quit addictions. 

Some, like yourself in this case, do not.

Prove it - don't just repeat your assertion. And if your argument is based on cost, you're going to have to say what financial value you put on privacy.

&gt; I have little patience for those who value their privacy over the well-being of others.

Ok, now you're coming back to the assertion that this will benefit others as well as save costs. Again, prove it, don't just repeat your assertion. And to do this, you need to establish how you weigh privacy against medical outcome. Do you for instance advocate a total ban on smoking in the entire UK, over-riding individual choice? There would be more justification for that draconian proposal than for anything that you have said. Do you agree that everyone should have their cholesterol intake tracked with ration books? Perhaps we should ban private transport because of its high accident rate? If not, you agree that privacy and individual choice have a value which in some cases outweighs medical consequences. Now tell me on what basis you weigh the two against each other.

Unfortunately the blame here lies not just on the teachers/school system but on the parents. How does a parent live with a child for 18 years and not know they are having problems reading?? That blows my mind.

There are many things that have changed in the school system over the years. In our area children are no longer taught to write in cursive (which is unfortunate because there are many signs, etc. they will not be able to properly understand), and are being told that using the borrowing and carrying method in subtraction and addition problems is the ""wrong"" way to do arithmetic. 

I remember in school I had to drop a math class because I couldn't afford to purchase one of the specialty calculators... They had several available, but were only willing to allow students to borrow them for a set period of time. I was actually very interested and pretty good at math, too. As a girl in our school, that was uncommon.

Our priorities as a nation, and as parents, are very damaged and skewed right now when it comes to our kids' education.

Until those priorities and views change we will continue to be behind in the education of our children, and our children (as well as our country's) future will suffer for it."

As a vegetarian, my diet should be a lot cheaper than it is in practice, since meat is such a resource-intensive way to produce nutrients, but in reality, I sense that I spend more than I would otherwise, gram for gram. 

Sometimes there is an apparent discount (beef burrito: $8.50, chicken: $8.00, bean: $7.50, as an example), but if you think about it, the bean burrito should be like half the price of the meat ones. 

Thanks to American farm subsidies and the bicameral legislature, this is unlikely to change soon, at least from within. I fear external forces will force its change at an inopportune moment.

As a ""nice"" player, I want to scavenge for items, kill a few zombies, and venture around the map with some friends or by myself. I want to discover new places, pretty vistas, and cool loot. I want to help new players find items and learn their way around the game. I don't want to be shot anytime I try to drink from a water pump or try to enter a town. 

If it was just occasionally that would be one thing. Or if it wasn't so hard to find all the items you need to get back on track, it might be okay. But as it stands right now, I (or my friends) get killed a lot and are forced to start from scratch, essentially ""wasting"" hours just trying to get back to where we were in terms of location and items.

There are some non-PVP, KoS, and ""friendly"" servers out there that are usually better than the average server. There's still some killing, but it's usually only as a last-ditch effort to protect yourself. They're not perfect, but they're usually better than a standard server in terms of players killing each other."

frsp,DebateReligion,1388877149.0,"&gt; The fact that religion is universal does not mean it's either useful or correct.

But you cannot deny that it is a part of human nature, and human nature exists for a purpose.

&gt;The good thing about atheism is that you don't need a hard ruleset. As I've mentioned later, it's easier to realize that you're ultimately responsible for your actions.

I know, and I suppose atheism can be made to be work with natural law ethics, if nothing else but a handy guide, but if you go down to the roots I see atheism ultimately incompatible with anything but nihilism.

&gt;Egoism I define/understand in a very broad way. To me, acting in an egoist way is literally tautological. And claiming otherwise I take it as ""bad faith"", in the way Sartre put it.

I suppose it depends on how you use the words. Even as a Catholic, I would say that people are naturally driven in a self-interested way because we are created with God as our natural end and when we seek permanent satisfaction, it is self-interested, even if we find it in our self-interest to love selflessly. 

&gt;I don't think he makes a very good representation of existentialism, since existentialism is all about overcoming existential angst.

Well, true, but you have to understand all my friends think I'm a young Woody Allen, he resonates with me. 

&gt;First, how do you derive natural law? I reject that concept on the basis that ""is"" does not imply ""ought"".

I derive natural law from observing that everything in nature has a purpose and that contravening these purposes has bad consequences.

&gt;Is fellatio contra natura?

It depends where you blow the load.


&gt; Would any being capable of art be considered a person to you?

A being that naturally produces art would be exhibiting traits of rationality, yes.

&gt;Yet we can reasonably explain the origin of religion through natural evolution, from primitive animism to sophisticated theology.

That is an argument *for* religion, not against it. If human beings are hardwired to be religious, and religions universally point to some kind of transcendent reality, then the human person exists for transcendent reality.

&gt;While I agree that there's much nonsense, the point of abstract art is reducing the amount of data in the work, so that it allows the brain to reconstruct meaning.

True, but things signifying nothing cannot be considered art."

bombeater,changemyview,1388877269.0,"All right, thank you for clarifying that. I'm gonna give you some constructive criticism here, specifically about debating issues like this, even more specifically on forums that are intended for constructive debate.

To see where I'm coming from, focus on the perspective that much of the ""anti-TRP"" side of this debate comes from a place of sympathy for the girl in the story. With that in mind, this:

&gt; Why should OP have to cripple his possibilities for finding a mate just because of the possibility that some girls might be so socially inept as to be unable to handle themselves without being coddled like a 6 year old?

... is *needlessly* inflammatory. If you're honestly interested in exploring the space of possibility with another person in a discussion like this, it behooves you to craft your message in a way that makes your *disagreement* clearer than your *judgment*.

To elaborate on what I mean by that, here are the loaded terms you used in that phrase:

* **cripple** - creates sympathy for the guy, uses hyperbole to invoke the imagery of severe physical damage
* **socially inept** - casts judgment on the girl, portrays her actions as unreasonable
* **coddled like a 6 year old** - casts judgment on the girl, portrays her as being immature

Again, this is all based on the fact that you are actually interested in having a constructive debate. At this point, it's totally up to you to say ""If you have a problem with the way I express myself, it's your problem, not mine"". That would make you wrong, and a douchebag, but it's entirely your call. And to be honest, I was ready to assume that was how you felt based on the paragraph I quoted. You ignored most of what I said in the first part of my post, and reversed my summary but with more inflammatory language. Simply put, that isn't how to compare ideas and explore knowledge with people.

So, what is the non-judgmental way of phrasing the question? I'm not sure. The fact is that language, especially in discussions like this, is *extremely* important, and drastically influences how we handle and analyze ideas.

One thing that seems concrete to me, is that you feel like coming up with a socially acceptable white lie in such a situation is not only considered to be a basic social skill *right now*, but that it behooves men and women for it to remain that way.

That's what I really disagree with. There is no reason for everyday social situations to be minefields of discomfort for women. There is no reason to expect women to come up with lies to avoid bruising the ego of men who they are not interested in.

Think about it this way: Why is lying a basic social skill in the first place? Why would we consider a woman to be ""socially inept"" if she can't come up with a lie to get off of a man's lap?

Easy: **Because she's not supposed to make the man uncomfortable by explicitly rejecting him**.

By the time you get to the lie, you've already placed an unfair expectation on the woman. This phrase:

&gt; She couldn't just come up with a lie to get out of there? Wow, how socially inept.

And this phrase:

&gt; He couldn't just ask her if she'd like to sit on his lap first? Wow, how socially inept.

Are equivalent in terms of their basis in valuing people's comfort. We can't judge the girl for not lying unless we're also willing to judge the guy for not asking.

bozbalci,progrockmusic,1388877301.0,"I love Focus to death.

This album, for me, represents Parnassianism in music. It might or not be intentional, but just listen to ""Le Clochard"", ""Janis"", ""Moving Waves"" and ""Focus II"" in succession, and tell me that it doesn't paint a beautiful picture, using the delicate sounds of flute and the keys. I think that the album cover is hugely represented in the music, you can feel the colors from the notes.

Hocus Pocus is a crazy song. It brought a few elements from various musical genres and gave them a final touch with the scat vocals near the end. Very original work, and it has been covered very often (by heavy metal bands... what?)

Eruption? There is something about Focus's side-long tracks and me. I think that they are loosely planned, but that's not a very bad thing. I can still feel the band moving all together. I think Anonymus II is my least favorite side-long from them, Hamburger Concerto being my most favorite. But I don't see any other way Eruption could have been. It's just the way it had to be. I like it."

smootie,college,1388877742.0,"Non-trad student here.  I just got my bachelor's degree and I'm 34.

College was much easier this time around.  I'm much more disciplined and focused.  As a teenager, I was scared to talk to my profs, but as an older student, I wasn't intimidated by my profs and wasn't afraid to ask questions and go to office hours so I got the help I needed to do well.  I put my life on hold to go back to school, so I felt like I had a purpose and it was critical for me to succeed.

It was wonderful experience, and I am looking forward to starting grad school in a couple of weeks.

However, that being said, I don't think it's for everyone.  IF you have a clear, well-thought out goal in mind, then by all means you should go back to school.  There is no reason not to chase your dreams.

For example, I went back to school because I wanted to better myself and it was something I wanted to check off my bucket list.  I didn't care about job prospects or the employability of my degree, so I majored in something I thought was challenging and fulfilling.

However, if you are planning to go back to college for the purpose of getting a better job or making more money, then you should not do so unless you *thoroughly* research your intended career and find out what credentials are necessary to get into that field.  Often, just because you have a degree doesn't mean you can get the job you want.  

Choosing the wrong major will leave you worse off than you are now because you would have wasted several years of your time, and could be left with a lot of student loan debt."

* vegan potato salad (veganaise, mustard, pickle relish and dash of vinegar for the sauce, pretty standard) with diced celery and sliced black olives 
* pasta salad with Great Northern beans, sundried tomatoes, and a light italian vinigarette

* chickpeas marinated in red wine vinegar and olive oil with red onion, basil, and oregano (especially good on top of spinach). 

Each of these can take a lot of veggie add-ins. Cucumbers are delicious pickled along with the chickpeas, while cubed avocado makes the salad creamier without getting too bland. Cooked diced beets and green peas make a shockingly pink, but delicious, twist on potato salad. "

myrrlyn,teslore,1388877815.0,"Actually RD was the one to sic me on the Jungian Cave.

I personally am of the opinion that the Mortal Towers mirror the Divine Towers (note that RM is Stoned by Divinity, as is WGT in its way), and that the Stone of Snow-Throat can thus be a concept as is Ada-Mantia. Ada-Mantia gets to use an incredibly powerful impossipoint as its Stone, whereas Snow-Throat is ""merely"" the process of Tower assembly by the mortal Elves. In essence, its Stone can be construed to be the specific path by which the other Towers were made, thus serving both aspects of the Jungian Cave: the Failure of the Students, and the Path of the Master. The Failure aspect is that the Towers reinforce Mundus rather than provide escape, and the Success is the route of Tower Construction. Relative to the Ur-Tower, the Meric Towers are failures, but relative to the Meric Towers, Snow-Throat is the path of Success.

And yes, I'm aware that this is all complete and utter horse...speculation, backed up by prayer and whimsy and about as structurally integrable as a papier-mâché palace, but [Snow Throat](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/106664/stone_of_snow_throat/) Stone discussions are my [favorite places](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/101dwz/convention_20/c69rsp6) to go [tusks-out ridiculous](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1oihxh/the_stone_of_snowthroat/)."

While the illogical inconsistencies piled up, you actually had the courage to question your doubts, seek real answers and this may not be the same for friends. 

In light of that I would highly recommend reading Plato's [Allegory of the Cave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave.) 


So, no, I don't think you are selfish for thinking that. If seeds of doubt are planted in your friends due to your actions and conclusions, it is nothing more than an unintended consequence. You are not on the offensive and attacking someone who hasn't asked or isn't ready for it.

Serae,PCOS,1388878219.0,"Spironolactone helped with my PCOS related acne.  It wasn't BC.  I had some jaw acne left which I was able to deal with using Clindamycin and Trentinoin.  If I do break out now it's because I went on a dairy binge (I have always been sensitive to dairy) or I haven't been taking my spiro regularly.  

This is what worked for me.  Everyone is different, ofcourse.  My derm and endocrinologist told me that PCOS deals with hormonal acne but that what remained was not hormonal.  I needed to attack both types with different treatments.  They worked well for me.  The only thing that worked better was Accutane, but I can no longer take it."

WeaklyDominant,AskReddit,1388878228.0,"Not sure if somebody has posted this yet, but without a doubt the hardest riddle I've heard/somehow eventually managed to solve is called ""The Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever."" It's a doozy.

The riddle is a variant on those problems about two prison guards--one who always tells the truth and one who always lies--and an escaped prisoner who must determine their identities in some small number of questions. Only in this riddle, there are three Gods--one who always tells the truth, one who always lies, and one who randomly tells the truth or lies--and they reply 'da' or 'ja' in an alien language that you do not understand. Intrigued? Here's the complete riddle text (from Wikipedia):

&gt;Three gods A, B, and C are called, in no particular order, True, False, and Random. True always speaks truly, False always speaks falsely, but whether Random speaks truly or falsely is a completely random matter. Your task is to determine the identities of A, B, and C by asking three yes-no questions; each question must be put to exactly one god. The gods understand English, but will answer all questions in their own language, in which the words for yes and no are da and ja, in some order. You do not know which word means which.

&gt; Some clarifications:

&gt; * It could be that some god gets asked more than one question (and hence that some god is not asked any question at all).

&gt; * What the second question is, and to which god it is put, may depend on the answer to the first question. (And of course similarly for the third question.)

&gt; * Whether Random speaks truly or not should be thought of as depending on the flip of a coin hidden in his brain: if the coin comes down heads, he speaks truly; if tails, falsely.

Here's the link to the Wikipedia page if you're curious, but be warned that it contains the solution: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardest_Logic_Puzzle_Ever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardest_Logic_Puzzle_Ever)"

use_more_lube,changemyview,1388878246.0,"You were, at the very least, socially pressured and treated poorly. 
That woman is not one that I'd have as a friend, and not someone I'd allow in my home.

I don't think you were raped. I do *not think you were coerced. (edit - a word) 

If you turned her down, was there a chance of her making a scene? 
If she made a scene, you'd have been ""the guy who passed up on sex"" and in some social circles this is pretty damning.  Also, you found her attractive but didn't want to have sex right then - that is absolutely your right.   

However, if you reverse genders there are some things you may not have considered. 

Men are more powerful than women.   

She did not overpower you, and I'm guessing that physical violence (being attacked because you said no) was never even a concern of yours. 

(Please correct me if I'm wrong on these assumptions, because at this point I have little information on what happened. )

One of the things women learn is that men can get very violent very quickly, especially when sex or pride or anger are involved. 

Moreover, you weren't alone when she approached you and she didn't drug you nor did she take advantage of you when you were drunk. 

You were in complete control of your wits, and the only lever she held was some degree of social leverage. 

Thank you for the provocative (in the good way) question - made me rethink and examine my considerations on the matter.

the_glass_gecko,dogs,1388878394.0,"White chocolate is made with cocoa butter often (theobroma oil) but not any cocoa powder so it has a mild chocolate flavor from the fat of the cacao plant but not any flavor from the bean of it.  Theobromine is much higher as you concentrate the cocoa - so dark has more than milk.  Some white chocolates use vegetable oil or another type of fat rather than cocoa butter, which is hopefully what these dog treat places are doing, because cocoa butter does have small amounts of theobromine in it as well.

A friend of mine told me once that dogs can't digest theobromine so if a dog has a few hershey's kisses or something here and there throughout it's life it accumulates - it's never digested and a single big dose isn't necessarily the worst that can happen.  However it does take a lot to get a dog sick - WebMD cites an instance of an 8 lb poodle eating a pound of chocolate as one vet's worst chocolate poisoning experience, and even then the dog didn't die."

On a side note, most dating websites are designed by men. As someone in the design field, this is a huge pet peeve of mine. It shows in the experience the user has. The result is sites that are designed like how men would approach women. The dating sites designed by women are generally much different. They are based around events/interests.

I think OkCupid's major issue is that is it a bunch of guys who are using math and only math. That is why their CrazyBlindDate and Events have essentially failed or are not done well. It requires a different approach and I don't think they understand that.

I like your eyes, but like someone else said, try to do something about the darkness. I'm sure you've tried some things, and in some pics they look better than others so I'm guessing some days are worse than others. You just gotta find something that works.

You have a solid body. Work on the legs and it will be golden. Its not a deal breaker imo.

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,California,1388878694.0,"I understand not wanting to argue against hypotheticals. But there will be consequences if the airport were to be shutdown that need to be addressed as part of the pros and cons. 

You mentioned that a park would better serve the needs. While open space like that would be amazing, do you know how much it would cost to create a park that large? Tongva Park is 6.2 acres and cost $42.3 million. How would Santa Monica pay for a 227 acre park? That would be a $1.5 billion park. Obviously that is not how much they would spend per acre. So let's cut the spending by 1/6th of what they spent on Tongva Park. That is still about $230 million! Is that cost really in the best interest of residents? 

Again, I agree that arguing hypotheticals is often times fruitless. But you gave the example of a park instead of the airport but won't discuss the logistical impacts of that statement or the likelihood that a park would even happen. The repercussions of not having the airport are just as important to the discussion as the repercussions of having the airport. "

I believe that most people would not be okay with a daughter, sister, SO, or other close loved one participating in a pornographic film or photo session. Therefore, by viewing pornography, we are directly contributing to an industry that we obviously have a problem with at some level.

There is a difference between a poor choice, an unethical choice, and a non-choice (or nonconsent).

I might think that doing pornography would be a poor choice for my daughter, but that doesn't make it unethical, and it doesn't make viewing it unethical.  I think pornography is a fine choice for some people."

I'll define a just punishment one where you will suffer equally to the amount of suffering you inflict on someone/something or you show sincere remorse and regret on top of a milder punishment, where the suffering inflicted on yourself via the regret and the punishment add up to the suffering you inflicted.

This is a very barbaric way to define a just punishment, but it's irrelevant to my point really (my point being the bolded bit).

An eternal punishment means that you will suffer for eternity. Now, if you're familiar with the concept of infinity (I am a physicist, so I like to think that I am decently familiar with it), you'll realize the immensity of what eternity means.

You say it's the primary interest, that was sit for me too, learn something new, help people, join a gym or club.

People will start to see you in a new light and a better one, they will see you as more outgoing and will ask you to hang out IRL, as you start to hang out you will meet new people, ask for their names ect and make friends with them.

My family still thought I was a believer, but then told them that I was not.
My father was really cool about it since he's not the most religious guy out there. 
My mom on the other hand, went on by saying ""take what you want from the religion, and don't care about the other stuff"" and hoping that I was just a little religious. Now she has since accepted the fact that I'm an atheist.
My twin still ""pokes"" me with different comments on the subject, but I do the same to him. We both shrug it off and leave it at that.

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1388879410.0,"I would be pissed if I were you. Platonic relationships are one thing, but when someone does it view as ""just platonic"" (the boss) you have to handle them differently. Let's just say there really isn't anything going on between them and she has no interest in him. She knows what he wants, and actions speak louder than words. Even if she's saying that she has a boyfriend, if she's texting him everyday outside of work during odd hours, he might get the impression that she's interested. 

It's weird though because it's not like she can just be rude to him (he's her boss), but she can still be firm and not text him during those hours. That's incredibly weird too actually. Usually when you're tired you go to bed. I know once or twice I've stayed up late texting a friend because the conversation was interesting, but that's not something you do often. Nor would you do it with someone you see all day. 

This doesn't mean that she's definitely cheating or anything, but her behavior is really odd. Here's the deal, I know you're worried about pushing her away, but if she truly respected you she would understand your concerns and accommodate you. If texting her boss at 1 AM is more important than her feelings than you should reevaluate your relationship with her.

Just because she's not secretive anymore doesn't mean there isn't anything to hide. She probably noticed how accepting you were when she opened up a little, and that might be why she's more obvious about things. Just remember, trust is earned. She's the one who's been secretive, admits that this guy likes her, and is texting him late at night. I mean, who texts someone who likes them *that much* unless you like them or the attention? Usually if someone admits they have feelings for you you try to distance yourself a little, especially if you're in a relationship already. 

At the end of the day you can't control what she does or what she thinks of you. Definitely be calm when you talk to her, and explain your side clearly. However, if she is cheating she's not going to come out and admit it. She's already had opportunities to do that. It's probably not going to be until she can't deny it anymore that the truth comes out (if she's cheating). If you are clear, open, and rational it should be okay. If she reacts badly, then that's on her. 

Whether you bring this up or not doesn't change the fact that what she's doing is inappropriate and inconsiderate of your feelings."

Capetorial,AdviceAnimals,1388879508.0,"This guy's a socialist. Listen, dude. Capitalism and socialism have their merits. In socialism, you have steady work and efficiency. In capitalism, however, you get something quite different. Everything is far less efficient and absolutely chaotic (by comparison) but there's something really nice about capitalism....people are more likely to make their own ideas. Inventions are more often found. Capitalism improves whatever resources it has (not resources like iron and oil but resources in the sense that knowledge is a resource) while socialism uses it very efficiently. What the world really needs is both. The world needs socialist nations (or states or cities, doesn't really matter - could even be guilds) as well as capitalist counterparts. Making paper, for example, would be a strictly socialist activity - we've gotten damnned efficient at making paper and we're probably not gonna get much better. Making cars? Oh, capitalism, take that one capitalism. Which economic system is more fair...is up for debate. Would you rather live in a society where you can greatly succeed and greatly fail or one where it's nearly impossible to do either?

I like to work hard and inoften. I like to have a lot of time off while wealth is not very important to me. Enjoying my work and having time off, that's important. Capitalism affords me that...not socialism. "

ichibanmarshmallow,bestof,1388880007.0,"&gt;who can honestly say they know exactly what another complex human being really means/wants when they display mixed messages? 

If you're unsure, don't pursue. That shouldn't be difficult. Most women don't play hard to get. They play ""nice nos""

""Nice nos"" are when you don't look someone square in the eye and say ""No, I don't want to do _____"" because you don't want to seem like a bitch (as he and his friends may construe you to be) and because, frankly, you probably don't want to embarrass him. Unfortunately, many people assume ""nice no's"" don't mean what they actually are, and that it's ""hard to get"". If a woman isn't making her intentions clear enough that you can be certain about what she wants, assume it's a ""nice no"". Because if it's ""hard to get"", she'll return once you back off. If it was a nice no, she'll be happy and leave you alone.

&gt;you don't get to call people rapists when you regret doing something because it turned out badly

That's not what anyone's talking about here.

&gt;If seduction or convincing is akin to rape, you have to start throwing women who seduce married men into the pile with red pill men who don't let a couple verbal ""no's"" hold them back when there are physical signals that say ""yes.""

I... what? If someone is physically saying ""no"" fuck whatever their body language is saying (unless you're doing BDSM). In fact, you're probably misreading it. Respect a no from whoever it comes from.

&gt;YOU made the choice that your boundaries were less important to you than some random people getting the wrong impression of you. This is bad for so many reasons. Stand up for yourself. 

No, YOU became terrified. YOU became so scared that YOU had no idea what to do. YOU are fully encompassing the deer-in-headlights situation and while you should learn confidence to be able to stand up for yourself, your mindframe shouldn't have to be ""I hope I'm clear-thinking enough tonight that if someone crosses my physical boundaries, I can stand up for myself.""

carlaacat,EatCheapAndHealthy,1388880052.0,"Nuts are expensive, but I believe that buying them in bulk, raw, is way cheaper than buying nutty granola bars (which also have more sugar, fat, chemicals etc). Since you don't have options like a hardboiled egg or greek yogurt, nuts are worth the price to me. Almonds are sometimes an ok price and I love raw walnuts as well. It's also cheaper to make your own trail mix with raisins, dark chocolate chips, cheerios, etc. You just have to consider the longterm benefits vs. the upfront cost, I guess-- save up a little, invest in a bag or two of raw nuts, and stretch them out with other ingredients to give yourself a healthy and filling snack.

Pairing your peanut butter with apple slices or a banana makes for an interesting change of pace from bread. Also, ants on a log, while messy, can be packed somewhat neatly if you cut the celery in half and arrange the raisins like gear teeth and then stick the halves together.

She lists her body type as ""athletic"" on her online dating profiles, along with very carefully-cropped selfies, and it ultimately works against her because it's intentionally misleading.

I think you've got a fantastic body but, to be honest, I'm not sure that ""athletic"" is the best way to represent yourself.  I think that you'd have more success calling yourself ""thin"" and writing somewhere in your profile, ""Yeah, I'm thin, but I could kick your ass in a pair of yoga pants and heels.""  Or something.  Maybe not that.  I honestly believe that the type of guy who searches by body type for ""thin"" but excludes ""athletic"" is doing so because he doesn't want an Olympic weightlifter and he'd still love your figure, and I think those guys outnumber the ones looking for ""athletic"" but not ""thin"".

Some of the group is settling down while some of you are still clinging to the old dynamic. You may have to face the reality that your group has changed over the years and no longer fulfills the needs of all its members and that is why they are leaving. You're making an effort which is good but sometimes its just about the time people have to invest and it sounds like your friends don't have it anymore. I would make it known that you are always there for these people and maybe you can redevelop the friendships later but the group dynamic is probably dead.

the_clever_cuban,fantasybaseball,1388881034.0,I really like Rosario this year. I think he will get more starts behind home this year and in 120 games he still hit 21 homeruns and knocked in almost 80 runs. He's going to strike out a lot and not walk very often but he hits for a solid average and great power numbers. I'll easily take him and someone who I can plug and play when needed over someone who I would have to over pay for like Yadier Molina. Rosario actually out played Molina last season despite the fact that he played less games and was in a worse offense.

She told me that something needs to change, I felt bad telling my friends that I'm gonna start limiting my time with them but they understood completely because even they felt I was spending way too much time with them considering I have a serious girlfriend.

After that I spend the next couple of weeks with her ONLY - we connected again and I gradually started hanging out with friends again every now and then.

We've been together for 5.5 years now, I'm almost 23 yeras old.

I think that's what we fundamentally disagree on, to be ""Creepy"" it has to suggest or hint danger i think.

Hence a little old sweet lady going to the same park as me to steal a glimpse of me to brighten her day, isn't as creepy a a 6'ft 6 300lb biker doing the same.

creepy or not creepy is entirely a subjective and contextual thing. but creepy is like revulsion or disgust, its an extreme reaction to extreme stimuli.

It's also perfectly normal to have red (not painful!) marks from your bra, just as socks and waistbands give.  It needs to be snug to give support.

ToastedOtter,movies,1388881807.0,"&gt;I understand his first job, I think. He acts as an agent and a salesperson, right?

The McConaughey scene wasn't strictly illegal--they're just convincing people to put their investment earnings back into the market--sort of like letting it ride at the roulette wheel. And the brokers make money each time the investors buy a stock, so the more times they let it ride, the better off the brokers are.

&gt;So that's what I don't understand. How do they decide how much of a cut they take? I thought it was just this company that belfort worked for, that took that much of a cut.

The company charges transaction fees on every stock purchase. They make a certain amount of money based on the purchase, and the broker gets a cut of that, depending on company policy.

&gt;Then he gets his own warehouse, so at that point it seems like he's got his own company. So did he....take those 'pink slips' from the company he was working with, and bring them to his new company?

An over-the-counter, or pink sheet, trade, goes directly from buyer to seller, without being run through a standard stock or commodity exchange (though they may go through their own networks). Basically, if you can't get listed on a stock exchange, you can still sell your stocks through over-the-counter trades.

I'm fuzzy on the actual mechanisms, but I expect that the companies give their information (listed on the eponymous pink sheets) to brokers, who sell shares on the company's behalf. There isn't a structure to the market, as there is for a standard clearinghouse-based exchange.

&gt;I'm just kind of confused about the process, about how he goes from working for the little hole-in-the-wall into forming his huge company, and keeping the huge returns.

So basically, Belfort started as a broker, selling exchange-traded until his bank went belly-up. He went to work for a pink sheet broker, which offered far more money in commission for selling their penny stocks (presumably because the per-transaction profits were small, so the company made money off of quantity, rather than size, of trades, and needed to encourage people to sell, sell, sell!). Then he opened his own brokerage with his friends, which would pay out small commissions for well-known, reliable stocks ('blue-chips'), and high commissions for those pink-sheets. Essentially, they were building trust with clients by showing positive returns with the blue-chips, and then would encourage those clients to take on the risk of buying the pink sheet stocks, which were being represented as one-in-a-million opportunities."

That's just Sturgeon's law. For your criticism to mean anything, you would have to have found a problem with the core beliefs of the group. Which you have not done.The PUA community acknowledges a basic fact that men, unlike women,  need to put in a considerable amount of effort to get a relationship. That's the core belief, and it's important to recognize it as such. Negging, openers, showing value, kino, all of that is inessential to the core belief.Are a lot of people in TRP idiots? Of course. So are a lot of the people in atheism or whatever feminist subreddit you like. That's a people problem, it doesn't say anything about the value of the core ideas of the group."
riseandrise,AskWomen,1388881943.0,"This question is very timely for me because I just started seeing a new guy. We met on a dating site where he listed his orientation as ""straight"", but after a few dates he told me that he was actually bi. He explained that he was more attracted to women than men, and wasn't really interested in a relationship with a man, but when he listed his orientation as bi he only got responses from gay or bi men.

I'm pretty okay with it, though I'm glad he told me when he did. I think a lot of people have the belief that bisexuality is really just a pitstop on the way to accepting one's homosexuality, but I don't get that vibe from him at all. He's old enough (25) to know who and what he wants, and his family is liberal enough that I think if he were gay he'd just admit it and be gay. So I can accept that he's attracted to both sexes but specifically attracted to me.

Honestly my main concern with the whole situation is that I'm very sexually submissive; if my partner can't be dominant a fair amount of the time, I'll lose interest. I guess I was worried he'd want to be more submissive/feminine in bed, which I guess isn't a reasonable fear but it was my main concern. Happily that concern was unfounded.

Anyway, I think what he did was reasonable re: waiting to explain his sexuality. As much as I don't have a problem with him being bisexual, I might have been less likely to respond to his message if I saw that he was listed as bisexual on his profile. The way he went about things gave me the chance to get to know him a little and see that he was genuinely attracted to women in general and me in particular.

Oh, also, I don't know how other women would feel about this, but I'm actually pretty open to the idea of allowing him to experiment with men if we end up in a relationship together (which I hope we do). I don't feel threatened by that kind of experimentation because obviously a penis is something I can't provide. I'm also interested in MMF threesomes so... This could all be a win/win for me.

Hope this helps!"

My kid, however, listens to black and death metal, specifically the technical, melodic, symphonic and viking subgenres.  I was very concerned for a while because he was only 12 when he started listening to it, but I didn't deny him.  Instead I just kept a close eye on him and made sure the music didn't affect him in a negative way.  

He's now almost 14 and he still listens to it but his tastes diversify as he matures.  He's more open different genres now as well as classic bands and enjoys tracing the roots of his favorite musicians' influences.  This is his 3rd year in the school band as a percussionist and has recently expressed a desire to write a symphony.  This may or may not happen, but he has the heart of a musician for sure."

bombeater,changemyview,1388882675.0,"Awesome, now we're getting somewhere!

&gt; Honestly, I see nothing wrong with telling the guy off directly, but the girl did.

I think this is where the disconnect happens between a lot of people debating issues like this. It comes back to the ""four options"" that /u/Cenodoxus [originally wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1u9994/starting_to_think_the_red_pill_philosophy_will/ceg25ql).

You wrote that ""there's an easy way out"", but it's not actually easy. Ultimately, everything about the ""convenient lie"" scenario falls under what Cenodoxus described in Option #1, with my additions in italics:

&gt; **Option #1: I can try to remove myself:** What if he pulls me back? He's stronger than I am and can do this easily. What if he interprets it as playing hard to get and we get into what he sees a playful wrestling match? *I could lie and say I have to go to the bathroom, but what if he finds me after I'm done and keeps getting physical?*

The point is twofold:

1. **Men touching reluctant women is not considered awkward.**
2. **Women shooting down men who want to touch them is considered awkward.**

If she lies and he doesn't take the hint, it becomes an escalating loop that always comes back to the four shitty options, with the woman feeling less and less comfortable each time, with no additional risk from the man. **No matter what**, if the man wants to keep touching her and she doesn't want him to, she **WILL** have to choose one of those four options, period.

1. Men touching reluctant women is not considered awkward. **Because of this, men can escalate physically with impunity.**
2. Women shooting down men who want to touch them is considered awkward. **Because of this, any unwanted advance from a man instantly signifies to the woman that she must now either A.) repeatedly deal with him until he gets the hint, which might be all night, or B.) deal with the consequences of rejecting him.**

You might say, ""So what, all OP did was pull her into his lap. He didn't badger her for the rest of the night."" Honestly, in a perfect world, I would agree that this means it wasn't a problem. If we lived in a culture where guys could do stuff like that and women could smile and say ""Oh, I'm not comfortable with that,"" and she could rely on being socially supported in doing so, I would abso-freakin'-lutely agree that it isn't a problem.

In closing, I have three points:

A.) We don't live in that world. Instead, women have to choose between hiding their discomfort or being judged for rejecting men, and as long as that's the case, it's ultimately disrespectful and unfair to potentially impose that kind of fearful situation on a woman just because you think they might possibly have sex with you.

B.) It's silly to even hyperbolically characterize ""no pulling reluctant girls into your lap"" as ""crippling your chances of finding a mate"". I've had no problem finding mates and I have *never* made an unsolicited physical advance on someone who hadn't explicitly consented or without explicitly asking first.

C.) I recognize that I have written all of this with the assumption that the girl wasn't interested. However, it's not enough to say ""she might have wanted it"". The fact is that this sort of situation, while casual and occasionally frustrating for men, is often scary and simply dangerous for many women, and we as a society can do better."

Vilhu,malefashionadvice,1388882907.0,"By no means did I intend to offend you. Hope you understand that. Although I want to give you some insight in my reaction. This advice might be a bit unwarranted, but here's my $.02 about that picture. You have good facial features, and the glasses suit you well. The shirt and the beard? Not so much. 

The shirt fits as in it lands on the correct spots of your body (as far as I can see). That's great, but what kills it for me is the collar and the pattern. The text on it really helps *cheapen* it (for me), it gives me a dad-visiting-Hawaii vibe. 

I'm unsure whats going on at the collar area, the shirt simply seems to be missing a button? It looks almost like the shirt is trying to be a blazer up there. For strongly patterned shirts I'd recommend trying to find more classic cuts. Since they alone are a big focal point of an outfit, adding more complexities becomes to much.

frsp,DebateReligion,1388883489.0,"&gt; Moral emotivism says that what is right is whatever we feel is right.

That's just silly.

&gt;It marks the point that morality cannot be deduced from observation. A slap in the face of ""natural law"", to begin with!

Not when natural ends and purposes are clearly discernible.

&gt;Kantian deontology does not require a God. Kant uses God as a hypothetical postulate for ""do as your conscience dictates, or you'll burn in Hell"", which seems kind of redundant to me. ""Do as if everyone was to follow your example"".

Kant is alright. Typical Prussian, though, do as your told.

&gt;Utilitarianism proposes that utility (happiness, satisfaction, etc) ought to be maximized. Whatever maximizes utility is good. Hedonism (pleasurable = moral), including Epicureism (intellectual pleasures over purely physical ones) lend themselves to be used for utilitarianism.

Utilitarianism fails to explain *why* utility should be maximized, and furthermore, utility is subjective. And what if a wild utility monster appears?

&gt;Virtue ethics say that what matters the most is good intention. Good intention + knowledge leads to good actions.

Asking yourself, ""what would a good person do"" is always a good way to start, yes.

&gt;Then we get nihilism. All of the above have some critical flaws, even if they can give us some orientation, so: ""logic can't back morality or purpose, everything sucks and I wanna die, but I won't kill myself because of my survival instinct is stronger than my depression"". Man, Schopenhauer is depressing.

There you go. 

&gt;And from the ashes of nihilism, existentialism arises. Going for the Nietzschean way: ""My survival instinct is stronger than my depression, logic can't back morality or purpose, I can do whatever I want, I can create my own values"".

""Existence precedes essence"" I would say holds true to some degree, but if we reductio ad absurdum that shit then it amounts to a denial of any sort of human nature, a tabula rasa on crack. Not that creating meaning is not a worthy goal.

&gt;Kierkegaard, who was a theist, had another view. We give meaning to our own life. When we die, we give God our life for him to judge, and see what we have created.

I don't disagree. I would say that every human has both a natural purpose shared with all humans and then he is required to discover his subjective meaning.

&gt;Swallowed. I don't know if you are still serious, but I am.

Wrong orifice. I'm being completely serious.

&gt;Not necessarily. All moths are drawn to lightbulbs. Does it mean the purpose of moths is to persist until they burn?

Lightbulbs mimic the sun to a moth, it is a dim reflection of the purpose of moth action. This actually works as an analogy for the religious instinct of the human race groping around looking for the truth.

So, that said:

Suburban sprawl will probably stay level. As it expands further from each city, it gets more frustrating to have to commute an hour each way. So people are going to continue to move closer to denser downtowns. 

But then there's the question of companies in suburban campuses. People will still willingly live out in the suburbs and drive every day to these companies. I think it depends a lot on the industry culture - for example, the tech industry will continue to move to buildings in downtown San Francisco , while the oil industry will continue to have car-oriented campuses in the Energy Corridor of Houston.

I'm fine with stevia, eyrthritol, and the sweeteners with a lower GI.

Unfortunately, a lot of ""no sugar"" items use sucralose (and sometimes maltodextrin).


Some people claim that some sweeteners kick them out of keto. Since I'm new, I really don't want to risk it too much so I don't always discount them when I'm looking at my carb intake. It's not the biggest deal in the world for me. I was mainly noticing this when I was looking for good flavor enhancers for some of my carbonated water.

b) deliberately breaking someone's arm is a jackass thing to do when you are larger and stronger than they are and are therefore perfectly capable of using far less violence and force than that to defend yourself and restrain that person

c) it is nasty and creepy (OMG I SAID THE C WORD) to be this gleeful and jubilant about such a situation, especially considering points a and b

Apparently the rest of the band has been asking him to come back so they can tour and release new music. I would love this to happen, but sadly it doesn't make sense for Josh to do it. (Source: The bassist in my band works at Fader Mountain with Josh, and all three of us are Nimbus alumni)"

People can hope for a more valuable dogecoin if more people get into it now and it gets distributed more.  The more coin = less value.  More people want to keep their coins as a currency = value goes up.  More places to spend doge = value goes up.  Not to mention that doge is basically an 'entry coin' to a lot of people because of luls.  

I dont think its TOO much of a stretch to be optimistic about the future.  But I dont think people should get their hopes up too much."

Since starting Estrogen, my depression has effectively disappeared. Testosterone was more or less causing me to be inhuman, completely uncaring for others or the future, just coasting through life because anything more was not worth the effort.  Taking a week off of work had me come back just as stressed as I left.

But now, I feel ""right"". I don't feel anxious just as matter of course. I have hopes and dreams, can look forward to the future. I feel alive and real.

There are some other parts to it as well. Taking estrogen won't give me everything I need it to, but the fact that it's moving me in the right direction is enough.  HRT is a powerful thing. It's capable of doing more than you probably think it can."

Duffadash,Games,1388885969.0,"I would be delighted to.

First and foremost, the single most prominent title people remember when talking about point-and-click adventure games is Monkey Island, and for good reason, the first three games are excellently written, genuinely funny, and bettered the genre in almost all ways. I would suggest starting with the third game of the series, [The Curse of Monkey Island](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/curse-of-monkey-island), it is based on Cell-shading instead of pixel-art, and it is free of almost all pitfalls of the genre (such as pixel-hunting). The game isn't readily available in stores, but you can probably get it somewhat cheaply from Amazon or Ebay. The game is playable on everything you can imagine through the [ScummVM](http://scummvm.org/).

To continue with the best of the comedy genre, it is definitely worth it to play through [Telltale's Sam &amp; Max series](http://www.telltalegames.com/samandmax/), which somehow manages to get progressively better through all three seasons. All three seasons are readily available everywhere.

Heralded as possibly THE best adventure game is Tim Schafer's masterpiece: [Grim Fandango](http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/17517), another LucasArts classic. The game's control scheme is quite dated, and some of the puzzles are almost impossible without using a walkthrough, but the world is masterly crafted; a combination of film noir elements and Mexican mythology surrounding the land/festival of the dead makes it a very unique atmosphere. Again the game is unavailable for purchase, but it shouldn't be too hard to track down a copy on Amazon or Ebay. To get the game running, use [ResidualVM](http://www.residualvm.org/), a sister project to the previously mentioned ScummVM.

Staying in the world of mythology is [Gabriel Knight](http://www.gog.com/game/gabriel_knight_sins_of_the_fathers). Skip everything but the [first two](http://www.gog.com/game/gabriel_knight_2_the_beast_within) games for now. The games explore a world with Dark Voodoo Rituals and supernatural powers lurking just below the surface of society. Expect conspiracies and lots of depth. Also expect that you might need to glance at a walkthrough once in a while. These two games are doubtlessly the best adventure games to come from Sierra, the creators of the graphical adventure genre.

Continuing in the same vein, [Broken Sword: Shadows of the Templars](http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/17503) is a fantastic game, centered on conspiracies concerning the Knights Templar. It is currently available anywhere in a new 'Director's Cut' edition, although the original release can still be gotten from GOG.com.

Moving on the Sci-Fi and Fantasy, two games stand out. The first one [The Longest Journey](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/longest-journey), which has been repeatedly praised for it's excellent writing, interesting mythology, world and characters, and it is still highly playable. The game shifts between a cyberpunk'ish futuristic setting and a fantasyworld of fairytales and magic, as the strong female protagonist deals with conspiracies, prophecies and possibly the end of the world. This game too is available most places.

Another fantastic science fiction game is [The Dig](http://www.mobygames.com/game/dig), again by LucasArts, it has possibly the most beautiful pixel art I have ever seen, and has you control an astronaut exploring a dead alien world, trying to figure out how to get home. This game is currently only available on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/6040/).

A third game of the Sci-Fi genre I just remembered is [Resonance](http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/21793), a newer indie title from Wadjet Eye Games, which have also put out a lot of other great titles such as [Gemini Rue](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/gemini-rue) and the [Blackwell series](http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/bestowers-of-eternity-the-blackwell-legacy-series), which are excellent games in their own right. I haven't played through all of these yet, so I will leave it to you to read a bit up on them and decide whether they're for you or not. The games should be available everywhere.

Moving on to horror, a genre I am less familiar with, a single title stands out. [I Have no Mouth, and I Must Scream](http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/17464) is a horribly sadistic and dark game, written by the award-winning sci-fi writer Harlan Ellison. It follows the last few surviving humans, being repeatedly tortured to insanity and/or death and then resurrected by an insane computer. The game has recently become available for purchase on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/245390/) and [GOG](http://www.gog.com/game/i_have_no_mouth_and_i_must_scream).

Next up is another recent indie title called [The Cat Lady](http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/23373), which tells the story of a sad woman's fight against depression in the form of a horror story. This game is somewhat more 'artsy' than the other games on this list, and has even less gameplay. Nonetheless it is extremely well-written, and is definitely worth a play. It is available almost anywhere.

Last up is [The Walking Dead](http://www.mobygames.com/game/walking-dead) by TellTale. Unless you've been living under a rock for the entire last two year, you should know why this game is on the list already. It is again not a classic point-and-click adventure game, but that shouldn't matter as it is apparently the best [non-tradional](http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/24014/page17) and best [overall adventure game](http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/24014/page19) of 2012.

First, she told me after we went out to the movies together, right after the movie. Something told me something like that was coming, but I still blanked and just stood there for several seconds when she said it. 

I think I said something to the effect of ""I'm cool with that but I don't know how I feel"" and then we parted ways. I eventually wrote her (we passed a notebook back and forth to communicate a lot) and explained my feelings and told her I wasn't into her. This was in high school, and the next thing I heard she went to the counselor's office and then went home. There was a lot of crying.

She didn't get over it, and I had a lot of emotional issues at the time, so eventually I asked her out and she was so happy. :/ That lasted two weeks and ended very, very badly.

We're very close friends now, but it took her a long time to get over it and things between us had this vague overtone of awkwardness for a *long* long time."

&gt;  it's hypocritical to mock the feelings men have when they are rejected.

I never *once* mocked the feelings that men have.  Ever.  In fact, I stated that I've been there myself.  I have no idea where you're pulling all this from - likely society's reaction and not mine despite the fact that you're discussing it with ME and not society - but it's absurd.  I think the article was ridiculous as fact and funny as satire because it's purpose was satirical.

My *only* point was that it's understandable for women to be surprised when the person they've viewed as a friend for a long time decides to stop being friends with them.  They don't deserve or are entitled to his friendship - as I've also said a number of times, but no one seems willing to admit it - but that, as a human being, they are absolutely entitled to feel a certain, understandable way about a situation even if the situation is understandable.

An rv will also kill you on gas, just get a tent and regular camping supplies. I guess if your in sw ohio and want to see the western landmarks it's either dip south and hit Grand Canyon/Zion/arches or start north and see mt Rushmore/Yellowstone. Be sure and see Yellowstone if at all possible and the Utah parks (Zion arches and Bryce) as well. Otherwise if someone has a smartphone take it day by day and look up state parks that happen to be the right distance away, you see crazy stuff way off the beaten path if you do this and I'd highly recommend it. For example this past august my gf and I were driving from nc to nm and we decided to take the little state roa that goes through the panhandle of Oklahoma, turned out a little state park called alabaster caverns was about the right distance to camp for the night so we pulled in, never having heard of it before in our lives, turned out to be one of the coolest cave tours I've ever been on and we got a gorgeous well appointed campground down at the bottom of a river canyon all to ourselves. The more open to changing plans and going with the flow you are, the more fun you'll have. 

The one other thing id say is if you have friends from college in interesting cities (San Fran, taos, Nashville, Austin, Portland, New Orleans etc) hit them up for couches to sleep on and a tour of their town, people tend to love to show college friends a good time if they drop in. Just don't let seeing people in their cities force to rigid of a structure on your drive, afterall, I've often decided I need an extra day in parks like Moab, Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon, as well as an extra day or two with friends in whatever city (due sometimes to hangover I'll admit)"

Overclock, yes. There isnt really a power requirement to overclock. SLI, definitely not. Just ask yourself if you really are willing to spend 500$ down the line for another GPU. The minimum reccomended PSU for 2 way SLI on 770's is 700Watts, according to PC Part Picker. I reccomend getting [this](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/corsair-power-supply-tx850m) power supply for SLI. Also, you can probably save 20$ by getting a seagate barracuda harddrive. So The optical drive is waaayy overkill, save 45$ and go with a simple iHas optical drive.

The defense isn't asked to prove their client is not guilty; the burden of proof lies on the prosecution. What you're doing (if you'll indulge my courtroom analogy) is asking the defense to prove that their client is not guilty, which simply isn't the way the burden of proof works."

Yeah, like I suggested in one of my points, there doesn't seem to be any research that tells us that moderate use is harmful.

I have no doubts people telling their accounts are being honest, but for each anecdote about negative effects, I'm sure there's another praising how it made their life better. Besides those recollections not providing precise information (dosage, frequency, etc) or being under experimental controls, we should be weary of lending too much credence to anecdotes because they likely result from ""self-selection bias."" People who have strong (either good or bad) opinions will share their stories, however, if the normal experience is neither amazing nor terrible, people are less likely to share boring stories. In other words, you'll hear the ""1 star"" and ""5 star"" reviews, but if the usual experience is really a 2 star, we won't know because they chose not to share."

In the interest of fairness, is there a level of humor that I'm missing here beyond ""what can we get away with"" and ""unsuccessful actors/middle-aged women"" are contemptible?

I don't see much wit, just a willingness to degrade people. What's the point?

edit: How predictable. Plenty of silent downvotes, zero intelligent responses. Here's my take:

The Leftist politics of the 60s became mainstream in the 90s, so that environmentalism, feminism, gay rights, etc. became default fashionable concerns for the more privileged classes. As the internet became widespread, young men with enough technical acumen to succeed at video games but not enough motivation (or smarts, or parents' money) to pursue a sustainable career in the tech industry began to feel entitled to some kind of recognition for their rarefied skills simply because computer technology is the hot toy of today. Since no one is impressed by someone's supposed intelligence that isn't actually put to use for the benefit of society, this recognition doesn't come. Consequently, loners of all stripes come to blame the ""official"" victims du jour for hogging the spotlight of attention &amp; sympathy that an adolescence pissed away online should have earned them. Thus, women, minorities, sexual deviants, and other ""weak"" (but more *respectfully* regarded) demographics become the enemy and are therefore worthy of as much ridicule as can be legally applied. Since most everyone in the Western world now has their basic needs met (and then some) the only enemy left for a confused, impotent rebel is the PC word police. Freedom = thoughtlessly shitting on anyone within sight (extra points if they're an easy target)

The entire attitude of a lot of this kind of comedy reeks of bitterness and misplaced aggression. Hand any of these ""edgy"" sociopaths a $60K+/yr programming job and doubtless, the real world's expectations of decorum will start to sink in."

She's struggling in this relationship to give you physical attention, and instead of fixing that she's going to go out and try to hook up with other guys? Nope, not cool.

If this was her plan to ""start her own engines"" so she could be more sexual with you, she would have told you, right? Since she's not a liar anymore? Even if you wouldn't like it, it would be better than thinking she's cheating.

* [Four Counties Beagle Club](http://www.fourcountiesbeagleclub.co.uk/) - see Breeders section.

I have two Samoyeds, my first one I got through a similar website to what you are using and the breeder we picked was one of the few breeders there who did health tests on both parents and was happy for us to pick up the puppy in person and see their facility (which we loved). My second puppy I got from a breeder I found through my local Samoyed club. When buying a puppy you always have to be very picky about who you get your puppy from because you want to find a breeder who does the necessary health tests on both parents and cares about temperament."

        &gt;Indent by four spaces, then double linebreak

    2. Repeat.

And this will produce this:

1. Example    
    &gt;Quote

2. Example
    &gt;Quote

This is not reddit's fault. It is, to be painfully blunt, yours. Markdown is a text preprocessor that allow for HTML formatting without giving users HTML access. Markdown is an alternative to BBCode and is, in my opinion, much prettier, because the text is stored as you see it in comments, and then Markdown runs on page generation. This means that for Markdown-lacking things such as mobile applications, the actual text appears and rather than get shit like &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;th&gt;Col 1&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Col 2&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cell One&gt;&lt;/td&gt; blah blah blah, we see this:

    Col 1|Col 2
    :---:|:---:
    Cell 1|Cell 2

and you look at that and immediately recognize it as a table. Tags are horrible for humans to read. Markdown is not.

The ""formatting help"" at **every** text entry provides some information, as well as a link to Markdown's homepage. I also highly, highly recommend playing with it. A live updater such as featured in RES is also helpful. And when in doubt, use four spaces at the end of a line and a single line break to keep from making a new element set. I also wrote a short guide to Markdown on /r/myrrlyn that covers some obscure stuff, but is by no means comprehensive."

Here's what stands out to me though:        
&gt; We didn't follow the diet at all,

Look, I don't follow the diet either (I follow Engine 2/HSH; a plantstrong diet), but *a healthy salad and the others were low carb/fat/calories)* doesn't tell anyone anything.  The book actually recommends a eating 40%/40%/20% mix of Carbs/Protein/Fat, 5x per day varying between 300 - 500 calories a day depending on your weight/lifestyle (low activity office work or high activity construction worker).

So when you say low carb, fat, and calories, by what standard?  Is your healthy salad being covered in an oily dressing (1 tsbp of olive oil = 120 calories)?  

I think my favorite thing I ever read on reddit was on /r/fitness, it said something like ""Lose weight in the kitchen, gain muscle in the gym.""  You sound like you got the muscle part in your arms, but the weight part sounds like it's stemming from diet based on the small amount of info provided (and with me making many assumptions trying to fill in blanks)."

But I'll give it a shot

So the feel I'm getting from this flag is that you took inspiration from Cuba's flag, and then went from there. Since FGR is socialist or something I'll just assume I'm right here.

Problem with this is that you've taken the chevron of the flag and flipped it, or something. I have no idea. When a chevron is concerned you're going to want to put your emblem or whatever inside of the chevron that's immediately on the hoist (left side) of the flag.

The different thicknesses of the lines are pretty terrible too. This screams MS Paint, which you probably made it in.

On the plus side, the colours you used aren't shit. This is a major improvement over 90% of custom flags I've seen on here. 

What I'm going to do is make this look somewhat presentable. I'm also going to use my personal favourite shades of the colours you've chosen and you're just going to have to deal with that because Habsburg yellow is just the bees' knees

papermageling,MakeupAddiction,1388887677.0,"Start with tutorials from Lisa Eldridge and Goss Makeup artist. Wear makeup about as often as you can (preferably every day) so that you get a better sense of what you're doing. 

Don't wear any foundation or powder with spf. I'm actually also going to be doing my own wedding makeup in a bit over a month, and I just ordered some pro foundation samples (graftobian), because I want something that photographs beautifully. There's also ""no-color"" powder which MUAs use, which is apparently also great for photoshoots. If you'd rather try in store, look at MUFE. 

In general, you want matte (or nearly matte) textures. You can put a bit of highlight exactly where you want it, but you don't want it everywhere. Like, go for a matte blush, foundation, etc. 

You may want to try some subtle false eyelashes. 

Anyway, in general, for wedding makeup, a reasonably natural look is often considered good, and you need things to last and to photograph well. Look things up as much as possible. 

For lipstick, try Revlon Just Bitten Balm Stains. I've found them extremely good at staying. Use a lip brush for a crisp line. If your natural line is blurry, decide where you want your line to be. "

A few years ago things changed when I decided to care more about my appearance and I'm now supposedly ""a sexy little thing"". It has given me much more confidence and I feel a lot better about myself, I'm happier.
I get compliments a lot more often now (beyond comparison), but I maintain the same groups of friends and I feel like I'm still the same person, just under a refurbished wrap.

So as popular overall, noticed by getting different type of compliments (about my physical appearance, which is nice but I liked the personality ones I got before just as much) and being asked much more often. It hasn't affected my friendships in the slightest nor my personality much (apart from becoming much more confident). The effort had more to do with hair and starting to wear much more feminine clothes so it wasn't a big deal at all and it was most definitely worth it.

1. If you want to use an ordered list, just use it. Don't cop out by putting the ) to block it. To do multiline stuff in a single list element, end each line with four spaces (    ) and put in a single linebreak, and then indent by four spaces. Because what you did triggered the `code` element, and now your non-primary `&lt;li&gt;` lines are a pain to read.

2. `&lt;hr&gt;` breaks are four underscores `____`. Much prettier than a string of ~'s.

Responding to your ideas:

1. I feel that this could lead to power abuse quickly, but since downvotes are already public (though opt-out) information, it's not mechanically difficult. Perhaps a list of total karma a user pumps into a subreddit, and below a certain ratio of up-to-downvotes, their name becomes visible.

hint: 

Affect as verb: means ""to impact."" (the force of the kick affects the distance traveled by the ball = the force of the kick impacts the distance traveled by the ball).

Affect as noun: means an outward display of a mood or emotion. (after seeing the horrible images, his affect was clearly disturbed).

Effect as a verb: means ""to cause."" (The new Pope is trying to effect changes on the Catholic church).

Effect as a noun: means the consequence of a cause. (pulling the trigger of a loaded weapon has the effect of causing it to fire). This is also where the meaning of special effect comes from - the cause may be CGI or a special lens, what the audience sees is the effect.

xadriancalim,relationships,1388888214.0,"I honestly don't know what caused it.  I mean, there was an age gap and in the end she probably just wasn't ready to make that step and I was.  Just different points in our lives.  But, I'm also pretty sure she started seeing someone else right away despite saying otherwise.  Thing is, we stopped talking immediately so I'll never know.

Now I'm so-so.  I'm not crippled emotionally like I was but I still have days when I miss her and the life we had and the friendship and the contact.  Sometimes it's unbearable and I still break down.  But they don't last long and come less frequently.  I've gone on a few dates (with marginal success) and I'm actually right at the beginning of something with someone new.

I don't think I'll ever be over this one.  Despite the age gap, we shared so many interests and view points and goals.  There were so many little things we didn't have to worry about which made everything comfortable and allowed us to do adventurous things.  I really hope I can find that again.  Which is my problem being on OKC right now is I'm looking for her clone and that's not fair to anyone.

I have a lot of internal stuff I need to sort out.  I've seen a lot of bad behavior when it comes to relationships.  Despite my age, I've dated very few people.  I've had relationships (a marriage and long engagement) but I've never done the meet-and-date routine.  I always sort of just end up with people.  I don't know if I can handle the idea of picking someone out and trying to find out if they're a good match or not.  I'm better at the relationship part, not the dating part.  But we'll see.

Thanks for asking. :)"

I was one of those people that cheated by eating WAY less to lose buckets of weight. It was stupid and made me feel tired all of the time. Nowadays, I am doing it the right way - eating more consistently and maintaining a much more active lifestyle.

I didn't notice until about the same time, we didn't have any classes together, but we would socialize a lot. When we went out to eat she would just glance at the menu for 5 seconds and say ""I can't decide, I'll just have whatever you have."" After a few repeat instances I just asked her and she started crying and said that nobody had ever taken the time to teach her and her Mum had done all her homework since forever. 

After dropping out and working she paid for an adult tutor for a few months. Turns out she's dyslexic but her tutor gave her the tools to deal with it and now at 26 she can read enough to fill out forms, text message, read news articles, and most importantly, as a really bad driver previously, read road signs...

Now I do know that Cyrus does have a fan base and has people who do admire her, but that goes back to how one is exposed to her. Some people will be exposed to her in a positive light and some in a negative and this is true for almost any popular figure. And even if they are exposed to Cyrus in a positive light their view may change as they get older.

The best personal comparison I can make is to my personal interest in punk music. Getting into it, I could have fallen into the drugs and violence part of the culture but I ended up gaining interest in the part of it that promotes political awareness and a straight-edge lifestyle.

GoNavy_09,AskReddit,1388888504.0,"Living on Mars. I know a lot of people say it will be possible in x amount of years to have a Mars base, but I think it would prove impossible or so difficult its not worth it. 


**Reasoning:**

- Costs:
Moving tools, materials, and all the things needed for infrastructure would be incredibly expensive. Wether it be many small trips or a few large ones, it would cost an astronomically insane price. [They can't even afford to send the astronauts on the ISS fresh laundry](http://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/livinginspace/Astronaut_Laundry.html), and you're telling me that we are going to have the funds to shoot all the tools and equipment needed to build and maintain a Mars mission, including wrenches, drills, computers, windows, doors, thousands of pounds of insulation, air purification systems, water purification systems, water, food, dirt, thousands of pounds of metal plating, communication systems, etc? Yeah right.  


- Risks:
The risks involved in living on Mars are quite high. First off, there is radiation. So assuming you don't get cancer within a short of time there is also the risk of system failures. What happens when an oxygen or water recycling machine stops working? You can't go to Mars Home Depot and ask the Martian workers for the water purification isle. No. You have to have reserve machines than can run for the many, many months you'll have to wait for a replacement part. But what if those shut down? What if the computer system controlling the machines has a problem? Nothing man mad is ever promised to always function and unlike the ISS or even a Moon base, NASA isn't going to be there within a day or two to help and a Mars base running on only partial efficiency is a problem. 
And that's just one thing. There are so many parts and machines that could have such a variety of problems. And then of course, sickness and health problems. There is always the risk of something from Earth being contaminated in some way and causing sickness or of the human body just having a derp moment and trying to kill itself. Aneurysms, appendicitis, unset of mental illness due to isolation are all things a team would need to be prepared for, but the problem is that there is no way to be prepared for every possible danger that could take place and help is a good ways away.

In the case of Greece and Italians politicians were to corrupt, Spain was to inexperienced to handle the euro.  
I think that to have the euro succeed or even to have the European Union to succeed, we have to reform how the European Union works. European Parlement should be smaller. Max 100 persons in the shairs there. Every European Law also validated by European ministers after the European Parlement said yes. No country has a veto. The European Union should function as a country. A country above all other European countries, who has the last word about stuff that inflicts whole EU. "

There are just too many inane side missions (That I feel compelled to do for no reason than that I'm a bit of a completionist). Ubisoft has missed a few basics like allowing you to change keybinds correctly (Grenade switching is set to the mousewheel despite every other PC game in existence using it to switch weapons), and give me a chase cam view for the vehicles instead of the clunky first-person only view. The mission to follow the man in white was the most incredibly painful ""Follow this guy, but don't get too close"" mission ever. Also, I have learned that I utterly loathe UPlay, not realizing that it was required to play before buying it. No, Ubisoft, I don't wan't to dork around with trying to add friends to your jank-ass UPlay service just so that I can attempt to play online with them when it actually works in Steam.

Feminism is post-modernist institution. 

##They outrightly question science and logic and deem it oppressive to women. 





&gt; The scientific realists accused the postmodernists of having effectively rejected scientific objectivity, the scientific method, and scientific knowledge. Scientific realists (such as Norman Levitt, Paul R. Gross, Jean Bricmont and Alan Sokal) argued that scientific knowledge is real, and that postmodernists thought that it is not real. 



##


&gt; The scientific realists argued that large swaths of scholarship, amounting to a rejection of objectivity and realism, had been influenced by major 20th Century poststructuralist philosophers (such as Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Jean-François Lyotard and others), whose work they declared to be incomprehensible or meaningless. They implicated a broad range of fields in this trend, including cultural studies, cultural anthropology, **feminist studies**, comparative literature, media studies, and science and technology studies. They accused those postmodernist critics who did actually discuss science of having a limited understanding of it.

amk906,volleyball,1388888745.0,This is a good idea so you have the wide range of shots. Another thing to do when hitting out of system sets (transition sets) is just waiting on the ball. When you are hitting that quick tempo set you are adding a lot of energy to your hit. This is just because you are moving so quickly to go get the ball. Now when you are hitting these transition balls you are slowing down your approach in effect taking a lot of energy at your swing. So wait on these sets and see exactly where it is going so you don't need last minute adjustments in your approach. Then use all your bodies energy to go get the ball. Hopefully this helps.

Instead of thinking at why girls X doesn't want to be with me, I focused on what I want to do with my life, what sport, activity, skill I want to learn and enjoy.

People that liked my activities, sports and skills started to show up around me - you tend to meet people that practice your sport, or dance style, or whatever - and within those people some girls were quite nice. 

Because I already had a good common ground about what I liked to do with others, and with those new girls that kept coming in my life I had no problems dating and getting to know them, and even get into some relationships now and then.

With that said..  This was emotional filler...  That was really sad..  a bit disappointed Luffy didn't even try and use COC he doesn't know how strong that person will is..  The writers should have at least explain why he didn't use it.  "

bombeater,changemyview,1388888972.0,"&gt; I find when I debate this with people, it always devolves into an argument of semantics.

Why is that a devolution?

This always confuses me. People say, ""Now you're just arguing semantics,"" as if arguing over semantics is a waste of time. When arguing about *anything*, we need to use words. What could possibly be more important to any argument than figuring out *what the fuck we mean when we say a certain word*? Like... what is the point of even talking about *anything* if we all mean something wildly fucking different every time we say ""dog""?

For example:

&gt; gender egalitarianism (not feminism, important difference)

My personal definition of those two terms is *literally* synonymous. I reiterate: *to me*, personally, gender egalitarianism and feminism are **literally** the same thing. There are many people for whom that is also true.

Feminism is controversial because no one can agree on what it means. There are a few hundred thousand people who believe it means the same thing as gender egalitarianism. There are a few hundred thousand who believe it means ""man-hating bulldykes"". There are a few hundred thousand who believe it means ""equal rights for both genders, but women should still be ashamed of being sluts"". 

**ALL OF THESE PEOPLE CALL THEMSELVES ""FEMINIST"".**

Everyone thinks their meaning is the ""one true"" meaning, and there is literally **NO FUCKING REASON WHATSOEVER** for any particular interpretation to be *inherently* more valid than the others.

To a certain extent, we are having the same problem with TRP. Because there is no central ""leader"" or authoritative source of information, it's possible to argue back and forth until you're blue in the face about ""someone said some pretty fucked up shit on the TRP sub""/""no dude, that's not TRP"".

So it comes down to language. Language is extremely fucking important. Humans are irrational creatures, and language plugs deeply into the irrational parts of our brain. Sticks and stones may break your bones, but words leave psychological wounds that might never heal. So I am very concerned with the language TRPers use, and I think it's fair to claim that articles linked from the very sidebar of the TRP subreddit is a valid source for what should be considered ""canonical"" TRP views.

&gt; TRP does not really dictate that one should treat woman in an inferior way.

Yes it does. I'll tell you why it does and I'll tell you why I disagree with it. Here is an excerpt from the [introductory post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/12v1hf/almost_a_hundred_subscribers_welcome_newcomers/) linked on the TRP sub sidebar:

&gt; Feminism is a sexual strategy. It puts women into the best position they can find, to select mates, to determine when they want to switch mates, to locate the best dna possible, and to garner the most resources they can individually achieve.

&gt; The Red Pill is men's sexual strategy. Reality is happening, and we need to make sure that we adjust our strategy accordingly.

The Red Pill makes sex and relationships *oppositional*. There is no arguing this.

&gt; For instance, men are disposable. ... for women, she's willing to leave just as long as the relationship hits the rocks and a guy who is objectively better in every way comes offering her more.

It's right there in the manifesto. Over and over again. ""Women cannot be trusted.""

&gt; As nice as it would be to relax, trust and be vulnerable, upfront, rational and open, the great abyss is still the lack of an ability for women to love Men as Men would like them to.

""Men should run the show. Women will fuck you over. Women are in it for themselves.""

&gt; Men have been, and should be, the more dominant gender, not because of some imagined divine right or physical prowess, but because on some rudimentary psychological level we ought to realized that a woman’s love is contingent upon our capacity to maintain that love in spite of a woman’s hypergamy.

Here's an excerpt from [Man affections vs. boy affections](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/15q8vw/a_very_insightful_analysis_of_the_nature_of/c83z3qx), again, linked to on the TRP sidebar:

&gt; on the flip side, relationships suddenly work incredibly well when you treat a girl not like an adult that you look up to, an adult that you seek validation from – but like a child.

How does *any* of this stuff sound even vaguely like what I was talking about? Furthermore, how does any of it even come close to...

&gt; TRP does not really dictate that one should treat woman in an inferior way.

...?

&gt; Yes, the language TRP uses is vitriolic and extremely offensive, but the point of that is largely to try and get people to wake the fuck up.

It doesn't matter what the point is: it does a completely shit job of it, and it creates toxic attitudes and false assumptions about women. You catch more flies with honey than vinegar. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to allow anger and bitterness to be the primary emotional content of advice that is ultimately supposed to result in having sex, an act that ostensibly benefits from the *healthy* emotional bond shared between two people.

Healthy relationships *are not* oppositional. I trust every single one of my female friends and partners with every ounce of depth and confidence and openness that I trust my male friends. Feminism is *not* a sexual strategy, women are not constantly searching for an objectively better male, and approaching sex and relationships with that assumption contributes to a toxic social outlook that will shit up the lives of everyone who comes in contact with it, myself included."

monochromatic0,tifu,1388889020.0,"Last year medicine student here. A couple things you should know:

1. Interrupting the act isn't and will never be an effective contraception method, *never* rely on it. Although some studies question their ""healthiness"", spermatozoids can be released before climax. Penetration isn't even necessary!

2. Pregnancy tests usually only start to be reliable after around 14 days of fecundation. If you took pregnancy tests one day after having sex, chances are these tests aren't being very helpful. The results you gave agree.

3. If you want to forget this once and for all, reliably, take a blood test for beta-HCG. See a doctor and tell him you want to make the test, doctors deal with this stuff everyday and they won't tell anyone about it, as everything you tell is confidential and will remain so. I'm not American so I don't know how it works for you, but in my country it's also possible to walk into a lab and do the test without medical prescription, without seeing doctors first. Not recommended though. 

4. STDs are a real concern here, as real as pregnancy. Unfortunately, people are also giving somewhat ""wrong"" advice here about the use of condoms. Condoms are really useful against infections, but they do not prevent all kinds of STDs! Unfortunately, the only safe way is abstinence. If you want to have sex though, do it with people you trust, and always using a condom. 

I hope everything works out for you, good luck!

EDIT: Ah, as someone said before, being worried can definitely delay periods. I know it's not always easy to stay calm, but try your best to keep control of the situation. It helps more than you think!"

With 12 Me in a Year I was stoked about the concept because I thought it was really original and unique but the writers of that show dropped the ball big time.

karhall,talesfromtamriel,1388889376.0,"Here's my contribution:

*Human Races*

**Nords:**

* Average height: 6'2"" (m) / 5'9"" (f)
* White, famous for their golden hair and icy blue eyes (not every Nord is blonde-and-blue).
* Chiseled facial structure, wide jaws and defined cheekbones. Most men sport thick beards.
* Men are usually well-built, women are usually of the same.

**Imperials (also known as Cyrodiils or Cyrods):**

* Average height: 5'10"" (m) / 5'7"" (f)
* Olive skin. Dark hair and eyes.
* Rounded facial structure. Soft cheekbones. Some men grow shorter facial hair, usually around the lips and chin.
* Both men and women are generally of slender build, though through military training the men can build heavy muscle.

**Redgaurds (also known as Yakudans):**

* Average height: 5'10"" (m) / 5'5"" (f)
* Ebony skin and dark hair. Eye color can vary greatly.
* Flatter noses and pronounced jaws. Men rarely grow facial hair, as it is often thin and difficult to manage.
* The most athletic race. Men are more athletic than the women. Low body fat percentage and plenty of lean muscle.

**Bretons:**

* Average height: 6'0"" (m) / 5'10"" (f)
* White. Hair and eye colors vary greatly.
* Long, thin facial structure and lightly pointed ears. Men can grow substantial facial hair.
* Due to their half-Mer blood, the Bretons are generally less athletic and muscular than the rest of their human counterparts.

*Merish Peoples*

**Altmer (High Elves):**

* Average height: 7'0"" (m) / 6'3"" (f)
* Golden-tan skin, yellow hair. Eye color varies in shades of blue or gold.
* Long, angular faces and almond-shaped eyes with long, pointed ears. Unable to grow substantial facial hair.
* Very little physical prowess, as they have more of an affinity for magic. A military trained Altmer will sport a decent amount of lean muscle.

**Dunmer (also known as Dark Elves):**

* Average height: 6'0"" (m) / 5'8"" (f)
* Skin color varies from purple-grey to ashen-grey. Black hair and blood-red eyes.
* Large, triangular chin and jaw structures. Strong, furrowed brows. High foreheads. Pointed ears. Able to grow minor facial hair around the lips and chin.
* Broad-shouldered men and slender women. Low body fat percentage.

**Bosmer (also known as Wood Elves):**

* Average height: 5'7"" (m) / 5'3"" (f)
* Brown skin, brown hair, dark eyes.
* Almond-shaped faces and slanted eyes. Soft features. A few men grow small beards on the chin.
* Light, thin, and toned. Their high-protein diet grants them much more lean muscle than their other Merish cousins.

**Orcs (also known as Orsimer):**

* Average height: 6'3"" (m) / 6'0"" (f)
* Skin color is various hues and shades of green depending on lineage. Most Orcs are born with black hair and dark eyes, though mutations can vary eye color and ritualistic hair dying is common.
* Round faces with flat noses and under-bitten jaws. Two large lower teeth, almost like tusks, are common among warriors. Orcs with higher social standing and more respect as combatants grow beards.
* A large, thick, muscular race. The women as well are strong. Their love of combat drives nearly all Orcs to grow even stronger and more powerful every day.

*Beast Races*

Here's where it gets interesting...

**Argonians:**

* Average height: ~5'8"" (m) / ~5'5"" (f)
* *The figures for average height can vary greatly depending on how much Hist sap the individual has ingested. The Hist have been known to create Argonian soldiers that are ±7'2"" during times like the Oblivion Crisis.*
* Scaled skin. Colors range from deep green to mottled brown, even some copper. Reptillian facial structure. Horned protrusions around the back of the head and along the lower jaw. Some Argonians sport plumage around the crown/back of the skull. Long tails. Clawed fingers with small amounts of webbing in between for swimming. No visible ears.
* Argonians share athletic characteristics with the Imperials.
* Female Argonians possess features similar to females of other races (mammary structures, wider hips, etc.), though it is unclear if they serve the same function.

**Khajiit:**

* Average height: 5'9"" (Suthay-rhat m) / 5'6"" (Suthay-rhat f)
* *The figures for average height vary greatly depending on the breed of Khajiit. The most commonly encountered breed is the Suthay-rhat, a larger version of the Suthay breed (whose male members are measured around 5'5""). The largest recorded bipedal Khajiit was a Cathay-rhat at about 6'4"", and the smallest bipedal breed is the Suthay.*
* Based on the breed of Khajiit, the facial structure will vary in similarity to feline animals (Suthay-rhat have facial structures not unlike bobcats). Skin is covered in an even layer of fur, save the thicker growth around the face and neck that is trimmed short in respect for the Mane. Fur on top of the head is occasionally grown longer into dreadlocks or small braids. Fur color varies greatly from white to black, usually in shades of brown, orange, and gold. Clawed fingers. Long, feline tails. Pointed, feline ears set high on the skull.
* Khajiit share athletic characteristics with Bosmer.

I'm not saying these are set in stone, this is just my conjecture based on all the lore I've absorbed.

If you want more info on Argonian/Khajiiti physiology, I'd be happy to supply more sources; just shoot me a message."

Hajimotto,gaybros,1388889509.0,"Okay, so you start off by saying that specific groups of people are diseased and we should exterminate them. Then you are surprised when I politely swore at you for saying that I should be exterminated. If it is incorrect to call the gays diseased and advocate their extermination then it is also incorrect to call religious people diseased and advocate for their extermination. Both are an essential part of human identity. How identities form is a complex series of interactions and your identity should not be a judge-able factor. It is the persons actions and inactions that should be the evidence for the merits of a person. Please do not pretend you are more righteous then me when it is you that is advocating genocide or at least attempting to crush a part of others identity.  
  
You think pretty shallowly if you think that science is a challenge to religion, and I will repeat the reasoning again since you keep not understanding it. Religion lives outside of the constants of physical evidence. This is why it is called religion and not history. Attempting to show that a religious event cannot occur is a pseudo-scientific exercise that benefits neither. Religion is not about how much you can prove or even how much of it is actually real because it is an exercise in attempting to discover greater 'truths' not 'realities.' The reason that they should like emotional appeals is because they are emotional appeals. Religion appeals to your emotions and moralities to help you create a unifying framework for your non-physical existence. Being unable to understand that simple thing means you are condemned to straw manning my case.  
  
Furthermore, I can guess your next area of logic being the logic should always be held to a higher regard then emotions. I would challenge this idea on the grounds that logic can only tell the individual the cost and benefits of an action and never the merits of being the action. Take a simple action like sending 'Thank you' cards. You and they both get very little benefit from the action and thus it is logical to not send the cards because they impose a harm onto you without a substantial benefit in the short or long term. However, when you add in the emotional benefit of an individual then the action should be done not because it benefits you but because it makes the other person feel better even if it never benefits you. The ability to make 'even if' calculations is a manifestation of holding emotions on equal grounds to logic. Both are needed for a society to prosper.

I do, however, take issue with the fact that Orsinium was sacked **again** after the Warp in the West brought about a general reduction in hostilities. On the upside, the Orcs are moved out of populated areas and I'm hoping that they'll figure out a way to keep up the warrior and strength traditions that don't involve an endless back-and-forth of blood and flame with the neighbors. I think the Nords and Orcs have a pretty good system of (HEADCANON WARNING) beating the shit out of each other non-lethally as a coming-of-age ritual and general pastime and then being drinking and fighting buddies when someone else comes along that they both hate.

4LostSoulsinaBowl,baseball,1388889625.0,"According to bbref's oWAR (I don't count defensive WAR because there are thousands of metrics and none of them really encapsulate everything), Sheffield ranks 34th all time, in company with Boggs, Frank Thomas, Carew, Yaz, and Kaline. If you take all WAR into account, he's significantly lower (82nd), but still above HoFers like Killebrew, Greenberg, and Stargell.

Batting Wins, he's 30th, amongst guys like McCovey, Yaz, Henderson, and Mathews.

His OPS+ is 140, right between Chipper Jones and Reggie Jackson, tied with Duke Snider.

His similarity scores say the most similar players to him are Chipper Jones, Ott, Reggie, Griffey Jr, McGriff, Mantle, Billy Williams, Frank Robinson, Frank Thomas, and Al Kaline.

Jay Jaffe's not as kind to him, saying he would be the 12th best RF to be enshrined. Most of the RF's below him are guys you could make an argument shouldn't be in the Hall (Enos Slaughter, Chuck Klein, Harry Hooper, Sam Rice, etc.)

Bill James' Hall of Fame Monitor gives him a score of 158, with 100 being an average HoFer. That's the same number as Ryne Sandberg, just below Kirby Puckett, and just above Eddie Murray.

James' Hall of Fame Standards gives him a score of , with the average HoFer at 50. 61 ties him with George Brett and Ken Griffey Jr.

In terms of more conventional counting stats, he had over 500 HR, nearly 2700 H, almost 1700 RBI, with a slash line of .292/.393/.514

My opinion on the Hall is that it should be somewhere between inclusive and exclusive. I think we need to get rid of guys like Tinkers, Evers, Chance, Mazeroski, Lloyd Waner, and every guy whose last name starts with K-E-L-L. But I think guys like Tony Mullane, Jim McCormick, and Bill Dahlen have been unfairly overlooked. And, of course, I support the inductions of Shoeless Joe, Rose, Bonds, and Clemens. Unless, of course, you're prepared to kick out racists like Anson, Cobb, and Speaker; spitballers like Perry and Sutton; drug users like Fergie Jenkins and Paul Molitor; and players who continuously broke *federal law* by boozing during prohibition. Unless we're going to kick out Babe Ruth, we better fucking let in Barry Bonds.

DivineVodka,pcgaming,1388889687.0,"Honestly..  I found it a joke among us PC gamers about this so called ""addiction"" truth of the matter is we enjoy buying games...  We enjoy the hype train and see if we like a game...  We enjoy participating in sales just for the sheer amount of communication between players who likes this why you should by X etc etc.

If you honestly cannot control yourself to stop then something is wrong.  It's so easy to drop $100 in your steam wallet and never add another thing..  If you see one or two extra games?  Sure go ahead!  Pick them up even if it's $50 in total.  The point is you tell yourself if something catches your eye $50 is the most you will go over it.  

I bought 15 games and a DLC during this sale.  I have only played 2 ( 2+ hours).  The rest?  Either uninstalled or installed just sitting there.  League of Legends take up my time so most times I don't even remember to play them.  I have at least 100+ unplayed games out of 195..  and I have finished maybe ( or satisfied) 30-40+ will I play the others?  Yes I will!  Sometimes I see a game and wonder if I should buy it watch a TB video see he likes it explain why it's good and say why not.  Buy it install it...  Proceed to -_-..  not my kind of game and uninstall it and move on. 

Who seriously has the time to regret purchases when they have a freaking backlog?  You supported the developer you may not play it..  but at least he got $ from it.  Is this article just exaggerating or do people seriously sit down and feel sad about this?  Or worse are addicted to spending money on games to the point where they feel sad?  I am not judging I am honestly just confused.  At the end of the day even if I don't play it I am happy to support the developer especially if it's under freaking $10 dollars.

Also a fun part about this is Bundles for sure at least make up 30-40-50+ of our library for people with a huge catalog.  At least I think that number sounds about right...  Especially when you bought the bundle because you wanted 1 game out of 6 lol..  and you added the rest because you like how the scroll bar just keeps getting smaller."

xthorgoldx,AskReddit,1388889729.0,"Don't worry, the article is bullshit - it's misrepresenting definitions of ""temperature"" in contradictory ways that produce a seemingly incredible ""less-than-zero"" solution.

Temperature is defined as the amount of energy held by an atom. ""Absolute zero"" is the state in which an atom has *zero* energy - it's not moving at all. Under this definition, it's impossible to have a negative temperature.

However, we also define temperature (or heat) as the entropy state of mass. As you add energy to a system, the more chaotic it becomes. Absolute zero, therefore, is defined as a *very* ordered system, with anything more energetic being less orderly. However, in very artificial circumstances, it's possible to create scenarios in which adding energy to a system will cause it to become *more* orderly than a system at absolute zero, which, if you're interpreting tempreature by the chaotic state of the system, means that the orderly system must logically be at a negative temperature - it's more orderly than 0*!

Except, as I said, this is only the result of mixing two different interpretations of temperature and deriving an invalid answer as a result. It's like trying to measure speed in seconds per hour - you're just doing it wrong."

myrrlyn,teslore,1388889897.0,I honestly haven't been following it that much. I'm happy to see they're getting more into it.
javatimes,ftm,1388889897.0,"Ok, well first...24 is by no means old at all. I don't know how to change our communities to acknowledge that age is almost totally meaningless, and certainly people in their 20s are not old!
I went on testosterone when I was mid 20s, having started a social transition that inched along a few years prior to that. In 2006 when I started T I was right in a very average age group for transitioning. I mean, maybe a lot has changed in 7 years, but...
Anyway, not to get obsessed with the age thing.  I think what people who do not want a full adult post-pubescent male transition (and no judgment there) should do is look at long lists of what the effects of testosterone could be, and try to figure out which effects you'd want and which you don't, and see if it's feasible to try testosterone.  For instance, if you don't want your voice to change at all, that's one strike against T because almost certainly your voice will change in some way (not necessarily to a basso profundo of course). If losing your hair is a red flag, that's a more manageable problem because there are ways to mitigate some hair loss (though if balding is in the cards, eventually you will probably bald.) If body hair is a negative, there are many ways of dealing with that. If genital changes would help you or harm you, that's something to really think about, because it's as likely a change as voice. (Though, some people get no genital or voice change on testosterone, but that's much rarer.) 
I think you see what I'm saying.
Emotional effects of T are much harder to predict. But I think it would be best to expect a bit of emotional instability (it is puberty after all) and think about how that would effect you.
But don't let the structure of transition dictate who you are. If you live where you still have to get a therapist letter, you may have to act a bit more binary than you actually are (usually you can suss this out with the therapist.) Even with informed consent, a lot of places still aren't all that friendly to genderqueer folks. But you can fudge things a bit if you want to go on T to try it. I tried T. I was not at all sure I'd stay on it, but it turned out I really liked the effects, so I've stayed (mostly) on it.
hope this helps some.

neotecha,AskReddit,1388889980.0,"In an effort to educate you then, the Christian bible is split into two sections, the old Testament (pre history effectively up to Jesus) and the new testament (leading up to Jesus and following his death).

In the old Testament, there are ""laws"" defining what God's followers are allowed to do or how certain situations should be handled. Many of those things are no longer culturally relavent in today's society (including the ones that /u/FourArm listed, as well as things like 'If a rapist rapes a girl, he must pay compensation to her father and marry her, etc.). 

Many Christians also cite that Jesus made a ""New Covenant"" (i.e. as promise between God and humanity) that effectively overwrote the old rules. The line of thought here is that Jesus opened up the idea of who could be saved and removed some of those older rules (so now we can eat cheeseburgers -- mixed dairy and meat -- if we wanted to). By extension of the same argument, the ""old rules"" against homosexuality might not apply anymore, depending on who you ask..

DrinksWellWithOthers,pics,1388890079.0,"Good catch, yes this a waste sheet.  As a former McD's mgr, we used these to track inventory counts, not costs.  At the end of every day we counted inventory and tracked our waste.  Waste was food and material we had to discard because it had expired, or hit the ground, or any other reason we threw food out.  The beginning inventory less sales less waste should equal ending inventory.  That's why they charge for a medium cup, it subtracts from inventory and must be offset by a sale.  If a whole Big Mac was lost, we'd throw the container in the waste bin.  If a large fry was lost, we'd throw the large fry container in the waste bin.  It was all sifted through at the end of the day by a manger and tallied on one of these waste sheets.

If there was a serious deviation between counted inventory and calculated inventory (I seem to recall it needed to be more than a few percent), it warranted investigation.  I never had to valuate the waste, but it probably is good to put a cost on the sheet to let managers know a relative cost of the losses on their shift.

For some, it became a sense of pride to minimize waste on their shift.  Just a game between shift managers, not required by management.  In fact, no one I know ever got in trouble for excessive waste.  It's just an inventory tracking sheet."

The first time we said ""I love you"" we basically had an argument over who would say it first.  Both of us had said it to people before because we felt like we were supposed to reciprocate, but were terrified to say it first now that we really felt it.  Long story short, he ended up being the one to say it first.

So fast forward and I want to tell him that I want to marry him, but again I'm way too scared.  I told him that I had something to tell him and he said I had to say it first since he said ""I love you"" first.  I was still scared that we were thinking completely different things, so I even went so far as to say, ""It's five words, starting with 'I' and ending with 'You.'""  I finally ended up saying it, and he said he wanted to marry me too and I think we were engaged then.  We bought engagement rings together (yes, I bought one for him too). 

Then we realized no one had gotten down on one knee, so he decided to do that.  I said yes.

Years later, we still had not married but were living as a married couple and decided we were going to do it for real.  He had described to me the wedding ring he would like to have one day when we have money, so with my tax return I bought him the ring he had described.  I took him out to dinner and for dessert.  When we got home, I asked him to lift my frock, and there sat the ring box.  He said yes.  We got married.  It was awesome."

cincodenada,Christianity,1388890275.0,"What others have said, but specifically, from top to bottom, things that I don't agree with:

 * **""It is foolish to think that there is a God with a cosmic plan""** - I'm not convinced it's foolish, just that it's wrong.  There are lots of reasons people believe in God, I just don't think any of them are really compelling, particularly for me.

 * **""People can do as they please without eternal consequence""** is true to the letter (I don't believe in eternal, at least not in a human context), but there are plenty of consequences in this world, and **I don't live my life ""doing as I please""** - for one, my effects on other people are important

 * **""The more you have, the happier you will be""** - I'm not sure if this is supposed to be ascribed to me, but it's bullshit in any case.

 * **""Our existence has no grand meaning or purpose""** - this is a big one.  **My existence has meaning and purpose** (see below for more on that), it's just not tied to or defined by some deity - it's **defined by the relationships I have, the people I love, and the legacy I will leave behind** when I die.  It's defined by things that are real to me, not some deity that I don't think exists.

But perhaps most importantly, I disagree with the first line: **I don't really *live my life* according to my belief that there is no god**.  I think this is important because it's something Christians often don't understand.  I live my life according to my belief that humans are important, and we shouldn't be shitty to each other, and that I want to do my best to leave the world, in some small way, a better place than I entered it.

While I don't always agree with him, I like how Neil Degrasse Tyson put it:
&gt;I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And along the way, lessen the suffering of others. You’d be surprised how far that gets you.

See, none of that is *according to* my belief that god doesn't exist.  That's just incidental, some of could be described as a result, I suppose, but it's hard to live your life according to a non-belief.

Now, there's stuff I agree with in there too - briefly, it *is* ridiculous to think I am lost and need saving, or deserve Hell, an all-powerful god can be a comforting (and useful!) thought to some, Hell is often used to keep people in power and generally scare people into doing things, and of course I don't believe that god exists.  I'd say on average though, I disagree with more than I agree with, although some of that is due to the format.

**TL;DR:** Bold stuff above, also, I don't live my life *according to* my atheism, I live my life based on people being important, trying to lessen suffering, and not being a dick."

It's a lie of course, because corporations would buy each other out and all, but they'd argue this wouldn't happen because someone would undercut it eventually. This isn't very comforting though, since this could take decades. 

In short, libertarians don't believe their views would lead to plutocracy, but let's face it, they will. Right wing libertarianism sounds disastrous. Such libertarians seem to want to go back to the gilded age. 

Left libertarianism I'm not as aware of, but based on the link, it sounds like a form of anarcho communism, which I also wouldn't want either.

I'm sure they're trying to cut costs and I'm sure that what kind of staff they have to man qualifiers is part of that.

Second thoughts: These are not the typical quality of photos that are posted here. Shallow depth of field, good use of light, and dead-solid shot means that the photographer is at least pro-am. There's more than a tattoo on your right shoulder... a burn, maybe? The background in #1 is lots of photos on a corkboard. I think I've nailed what bugs me about #2 -- you've drawn attention to your eyes with makeup, but your smile is *completely* disconnected from them. The smile is a practiced ""social"" smile. You're not looking at the camera, either; just above and right... the photographer?

Third thoughts: I think you were *told* to smile for pic #2, and were not in the mood. I had to resize pic #1 to check, but I think you're not looking at the camera in that one either. Above and to the left. Same person?

Out on a limb: You're emotionally involved with the photographer. More than friends -- possibly a lot more.

EDIT: Had to roll back a long way through the posts to find [your first post](http://i.imgur.com/qFPMDlW.png). Reinforces everything I thought. You seem happier in the two more recent pics, but the older pic gives me *way* creepier vibes. The photographer is your husband/fiancee."

* **CPU:** No use spending money on an AMD CPU when you're building a 3k machine. The 4670k has equal performance across the board to the FX-8350 and runs cooler to boot.

* **Motherboard:** $100 is weak sauce for a $3k build, especially if were an FX-8350, regardless I chose a really nice ASUS Intel board with on-board wifi and more features than you could ever use.

* **Thermal Compound:** The H100i already has a one-time preapplied thermal paste, but if you insist on buying some now you may as well get the best on the market.

* **Memory:** For a gaming build, 16gb is an utter waste and you'll be hard pressed to use up 8gb. 16gb wont make your computer more powerful, no matter how strong the placebo effect is

* **SSD:** The 840 Pro isn't realistically better than the Evo, save some money

* **HDD:** With the SSD, the Caviar Black's are pointless to buy, even then they are only marginally better than a standard 7200rpm HDD. Another issue is that you are buying two 1tb drives instead of a 2tb drive. Fixed.

* **GPU:** The GTX 690 was only worth $1000 up to ~4+ months ago, since then single gpu cards have been coming out that compete with the GTX 690 in performance. Most recent is the GTX 780 ti, which is cheaper and is within margin of error of equaling the 690 in performance. To boot, this 780 ti model has the fastest factory overclock available as well as a quality aftermarket cooler. It would be niave to buy anything else, much less a more expensive SLI gpu, as SLI has issues. (Source: I own a GTX 690)

* **Sound Card:** These are flat out snake oil for the niave gamers, they don't make the sound better, if only louder. 99% of the time, the best sound quality is going to come from the rear auxiliary socket on the motherboard. The only truly audiophile option is an external digital converter. 

* Everything else looks good, but with this money saved, you may as well be buying a nicer-than Logitech mouse."

Rodalli,todayilearned,1388890564.0,"As someone with an interest and experience in german longsword fencing, this comment makes me very sad.

Actually, real swordfighting techniques are extremely strategic and the fights are fast-paced. Muscle memory takes over and you must read your opponent and make a decision in an instant. You almost have to know what your opponent is going to do before they do it in order to defeat them. An average fight if it was being done with sharps and the intent to kill, wouldn't usually last more than 30 seconds. It's that fast, and nearly any hit is going to be fatal, or is going to handicap the target in such a way that he isn't going to be able to properly defend himself from the next blow."

Additionally, as far as the Luffy vs. Enel fight goes, it was actually one of my favorite fights in the series, as it shows off how even the strongest of DF users can be defeated in a bad pairing. This means that no DF is ""unbeatable.""

My husband is, as my bipolar brother and I refer to people without mental issues, a ""normie.""  It took him some time to figure out what was going on during during my panic attacks, but once he did he was able to be a huge help.  Now, I feel so incredibly safe around him.  And when he consumed something that caused a panic attack in him, I was able to take care of him as well as a person could.  He puts up with some bullshit from me, but I put up with bullshit from him too that has nothing to do with being normal or not.  

I think you just need to warn a potential partner of what you deal with.  They may try it out and decide they can't deal with it; that's their decision.  But if you're open and honest about being depressed or having anxiety or whatever else, and a ""normie"" wants to date you, I see no problem with that."

An older animal that isn't breeding age anymore, why have it be a drain on resources to help the species?  Instead, auction off a hunt, with the money being used to help the surviving population.  Dollars from hunting licenses here in the states are used for conservation efforts.  Example, wolves.  You've been able to hunt them in Alaska.  And funds from taxes on Alaskan sales of guns and ammo used to hunt wolves helped pay for the reintroduction of wolves in the lower 48.  Now it will continue with the new wolf hunting and trapping seasons in various states.  The funds could be used by other states to reintroduce wolves into more of their traditional territories."

TheLittleGoodWolf,TheLastAirbender,1388890813.0,"&gt;The true mind can weather all the lies and illusions without being lost.

I'm not exactly sure of what is meant by ""the true mind"" but I think it refers to an ideal mind something to strive for, maybe ever truth itself. 

To weather something is to put it out in the open, to examine it, to see it, and to acknowledge it. To do this to lies and illusions can often be confusing and you can easily loose sight of where you were when you began and even where you are. 

This points to being open minded and to not let your judgment be clouded. Deep inside (in your true mind) you will always know what is right. When you stick to that you can examine all lies and illusions without bias, without fear, with unclouded eyes.

&gt;The true heart can tough the poison of hatred without being harmed.

The true heart I think refers to the soul, the honest soul, the innermost core of your being. Much like above I also think it's about an ideal to strive for, something that we all have the potential for but requires some effort to get to.

Hatred is an infectious, spiraling, and destructive feeling that I believe (I heard there was a study done on this) as been proven to actually damage the body itself. Anger and hatred is also a natural emotion to feel, we all feel it but we do not have to let it control us or damage us. 

By realizing what it is (with the true mind) we can tough out its effects without damage to our soul or body. There is some link to what guru Phatik said also but he said a whole lot and I can't recall what portion of it I'm after.

Basically it's okay to feel anger and hate, just know it's a destructive feeling and that it will bring you no good. Acknowledge it, accept it, embrace it, then let it go.

&gt;Since beginning-less time darkness thrives in the void but always yields to purifying light.

There is some imaging from the Kingdom Hearts series that well explains this. The closer you get to light the greater your shadow grows, and (maybe not from KH) the greater the darkness the brighter light shines.
Or something like that.

Darkness has always been seen as nothingness, as void, and been linked to evil. Just as you can shine a light to find your way in darkness, good will make evil yield. Just as hate can corrupt love, love can also purify hate.

That is my take on the quote at least."

Also lost some weight and grew taller, although that was more in high school. Let my freak flag fly with playing music, nerdiness, metal, books, etcetera. Made real friends.

In my sophomore year (junior now) at the big uni where I and many others from my elementary/high school go, four (I counted) boys who used to bully the shit out of me hit on me. Three of them didn't recognize me.

* Right at the beginning of freshman year - with people from high school, not until I met them again randomly

* More friends/socialization/people willing to come up and chat. I guess I don't have a problem being rejected by the guys or girls I like, but I am more in search of awesome people to be around than boy/girlfriends. However, I'm really put off by how upfront and brazen some people are about sheer attraction. Creepy, man.

* No. I, myself, am an introvert. If anything, I question people's motives more now.

* Not the ones that I like to hang out with.

My grandparents and my mother's siblings have told me they always knew there was something wrong in my childhood, but they didn't really recognize the scope. Mainly, they point to how my two siblings always had the very best designer clothing and everything money could buy while I was made to do without. My mother used to justify regularly and frequently buying $250 sneakers for my brother by saying his foot size and sports participation required it. 

Meanwhile, on the rare occasion she bought me clothing or shoes, they came from the cheapest outlet she could find. Cue me in a Polo shirt second with a horse with five legs. The better for my nMom to manipulate people to see me as a bit odd and isolate me. Only the family really recognized how she manipulated me into dressing oddly, and only in hindsight. I found out from friends of the family years later they thought I was dressing in crappy clothing from choice.

My grandmother apologized to me when we finally really talked. She wished she had tried to get me away from my nMom when she took me away after my grandma had raised me for the first six years of my life. Instead, she used to have me stay with her every school holiday longer than a week. She'd convince my mom to let her do that by offering to relieve her burdens. She even once flat out gave my mother money she wanted for some frivolous stupid in order to soften her up to let me visit. She tells me they only really recognized there was obviously something going on when they visited after I'd been living 1000 miles away with my nMomster and step-dad for about six months.

&gt; How am I able to commit my faith to something that is contradictory to who I am? 

I struggled with my faith (as Catholic/Christian) for a very long time, before I came out as transgender (assigned at birth as male, now female). The eventual line of thought that allowed me peace between the two is that I needed to come to terms with who I am first, before I can be a good servant to God.

I have no problem with this line of thought. Christianity is about half-again as old as Islam, but has many more factions or denominations within.  Christianity is effectively in the hands of the people, who translate it and interpret it different ways.  Some people have very strict interpretations for what is required for salvation (you can't break any rules without forgiveness) and others are relatively lax (All you need is to love God and you're good). 

From there, it's very possible that I'm wrong, but I believe that God is fully aware of this. I try to be the best person that I can be, and let God sort out the details.

The other possibility is that God chooses very particular people that he wants to save and is willing to cast aside any one else. If I just happen not to be in his chosen bunch, there's not much I can do. The Master does not need to heed my protests, so I just need to accept my fate."

Hoodwink,AskMen,1388891197.0,"I like to think I figured out fashion or at least part of the problems associated with it.

There's two competing strains of fashion - one where women with good figures who try to downplay their sexuality to be taken more seriously/conservatively.  And one where you play it up.  There is a constant confusion between the two fashion ''genetic'' strains because hotter women/marketing generally make the trends and everyone copies it.  And a lot of young women don't know whether if the particular clothing is playing their sexuality up or down.

I like that stuff on very good looking women with breast size trying to downplay their sexuality.  It makes them seem conservative/high-brow in their sexuality.  It adds a sort of virginal or high-brow purity to their efforts because if they wear anything else - their sexuality just oozes all over the place.

The problem is that women don't know what the clothing is doing to their bodies and are sometimes clueless because they just follow the crowd or don't know their bodies well enough."

bombeater,changemyview,1388891403.0,"&gt; Women couldn't possibly get more support these days if they make a guy's advances a visible issue. What you describe is almost the exact polar opposite of what happens in reality. At a minimum, the guy would get a sympathetic talking-to to leave the girl alone.

&gt; I genuinely have no clue as to what world you live in with this statement.

[This world](http://captainawkward.com/2012/08/07/322-323-my-friend-group-has-a-case-of-the-creepy-dude-how-do-we-clear-that-up/), and [this one](http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/disney-rape), and [this one](http://www.jimchines.com/2013/08/sexual-harassment-conversations-in-comic-form/), also [this one](http://www.xojane.com/relationships/stop-saying-i-have-a-boyfriend), can't forget [this one](http://www.baggagereclaim.co.uk/unwanted-attention-from-men/)...

If you need more examples, look no further than replies to very thread we're in.

&gt; taking a 'no' at face value would probably cut your chances pretty significantly.

Cut your chances of what... having sex with them? It seems pretty likely that someone who doesn't want to sit in your lap *also* doesn't want to have sex with you. ""But they play games"", we say. Sucks for them! Who wants to get with a game-playing girl? Not me. Never been with one, never will be. I don't care for it. There are plenty of girls who don't.

So here's what I think is going on.

You know the ""three blind men and an elephant"" joke? Where they're trying to figure out what this thing in the room with them is; one feels the tail and says ""It's a rope,"" another touches the leg and says ""It's a tree trunk,"" and the other feels the trunk and says ""It's a snake"".

You and I have had different experiences. You know a lot of guys who are paralyzed by fear of rejection, I know a lot of girls who are paralyzed by fear of rape and ostracism. However, I think I'm seeing more of the elephant here than you are, and this is why:

How many women do you know?

How many are you close friends with?

How many have you talked to about unwanted physical advances?

When you've spoken with women about this kind of thing, did you sound *anything* like what you wrote a few posts ago?:

&gt; Why should OP have to cripple his possibilities for finding a mate just because of the possibility that some girls might be so socially inept as to be unable to handle themselves without being coddled like a 6 year old?

If my hunch is right, then I can tell you exactly why it seems like we're living in different realities: you know a lot of guys, you listen to a lot of guys, and you don't listen to a lot of women.

*Most* of my close friends are women, and they aren't even the only ones who have confided in me about exactly the kind of negative experience I described.

(Okay so I've made some pretttttty huge assumptions here. If they're on target then I guess that's pretty badass of me, but if not, I apologize.) 

Even if I'm wrong and the average social group *really would* ostracize a guy for touching before they would ostracize a girl for rejecting him, why is it so important that guys are able to have ""the lap-pull"" and similar moves in their toolbox? *At best*, you have a willing girl on your lap who was already fond of you anyway (otherwise she wouldn't be too enthused about occupying your lap), but *at worst*, you are creating an incredibly uncomfortable experience for someone who was just minding their own business. Why is it worth violating someone's personal space *just* to send a signal that you want to bone them, which you can do in a million different ways?"

Humans take nine months to create a single offspring, and two or more at the same time is a relatively rare event. Meanwhile, a housecat takes roughly two months, and usually produces more than one offspring.

If you have never looked at a set of data and thought, ""this looks weird"" then you are a pretty bad scientist. Data is not omnipotent and can easily be swayed by incorrect assumptions or faulty variables. It is used as a tool in evaluating a proposal and by itself is insufficient. The models that are created based upon the data is the real realm of scientific creation. Oh looky here, data cannot be collected about religious ideas like morality, I bet it is because they are not equivalent things. They answer two different questions about reality.  
  
If you look at cultures that believe heavily in curses and spells you will actually find people that believe they are under the affect of a curse and their body will react to it. Within their framework of the world curses and spells exists and to them curses are more real then you. These afflictions can be linked to psychosomatic afflictions and not God's will, however, to them it is real and has real ramifications. Furthermore, in cultures that never have a word for a specific color like 'green' people will not identify the color. Their view of reality is no more real or less real then ours because we view things will a different set of assumptions. Reality is a temporary induced idea based upon assumptions that an individual has and for people that believe in God he is real in their reality. "

All throughout high school and college, on any assignment where I had to cite references, I always had to ask the teacher/professors how they wanted the resources cited because they always had some personal stylistic preferences.

On my mom's side my mom, grandpa, one aunt and one cousin who is a couple years younger than me smokes. (cousin also does pot.) My dad's side of the family is much worse. My dad and grandma smoke SOOO MUCH!! and my aunt died of lung cancer from smoking about 7 years back. I live in argentina, a culture where smoking and drinking not only are legal at the age of 18 but no one checks before selling you them. At least half of my friends age 16+ smoke and 95% of them drink. (I drink too but weak stuff for now. Beer chamagne and wine.  had tequila one day before a party but i threw up. It's so strong and it was my first night out partying and drinking.) When i see a good looking girl smoking a cig every now and then i think it's sexy (Especially if she blows out a thin stream of smoke after inhaling). If it's all she does and she looks like shit its a big turn off. I want to try it because in 2013 I have been battling depression most of the time and I think that smoking might make me temporarly happy. My dad told me that if he catches me smoking he would whip me with a belt (LOL) not because it's illigal or anything like that but  because he is addicted and he can't give them up. He has quit a few times in the past (i.e when my brother and I were born) but he always goes back. He doesnt want me to get hooked too or end up like my aunt. If i were to decide to choose to start it would be so easy to do it. Just go to any kiosk and buy a pack and lighter. A pack is like 11 pesos (10 pesos = 1 dollar.) I think that the only thing that is stoping me from starting is that for now i can get off from just being with a group of people that are smoking and inhaling the smoke.

""Fine!"" I replied, snapping them off and balling them into a cantaloupe-sized mound. I went to put them in my purse when I realized my purse and coat were on his couch. 

Where the hell was I going to smuggle these? I didn't trust my balance enough to get them back on. So I rocketed out of the bathroom and beelined to the couch. Trying to act quickly, I shoved them in the arm of my coat. He didn't say anything, so I assumed he chose to ignore my weird behavior. 

Later, I was trying to make a cool exit, so I pulled on my coat and hastily left without fanfare. It wasn't until I was halfway back to my place that I noticed the Spanx were gone.  Probably laying crumpled on his floor. I imagined him looking at them with curiosity, then confusion, then mild disgust as he realized what it was. A really off-putting souvenir, I bet. 

**TL;DR: I didn't want this guy to see my Spanx. They're probably burned in his mind forever.**

LasherDeviance,pics,1388891837.0,"The midwest outside of the plains is either mountainous, desert, rocky or plains. But the real reason is that the weather there is nice in the summer, if not in the deserts, or grueling in the winter, so it isn't as urbanized as one would think.  It's all agriculture, and that's where a good majority of our food comes from.

That's why all of the major US cities reside in a U-shaped area from western Washington down thru California, into the southwest, (New Mexico, Arizona, Texas), into the Deep south, (Louisiana-Florida), back up the east coast into Maine with a few major cities in the eastern part of the midwest, (Chicago, the Heart of the USA, Cleveland and St. Louis) 

All of the other major cities in the midwest, like in North and South Dakota, Idaho and Montana and Wyoming, have less than 1Million people and its more rural than anything. That's where all of the great natural wonders of the US reside as well, like Yellowstone, Mt. St. Helens, Grand Canyon. 

Also its a reminder of all of the Natives that died during the Western expansion of the early 1800's as well, so that part of the country is kind of sacred as well.  That's where our country symbol, The Bald Eagle, makes it's home, as well as mountain lions and buzzards and vultures and coyotes."

Scarcer,buildapc,1388892043.0,"* Single wide/single fan radiators are pointless to purchase, you may be better off going with a Cool Master Hyper 212 Evo, or going up to a Corsair H80i.

* That motherboard actually more than you technically need, if you want all the extra features, you may get it, but you can easily scale down to an ASUS Z87-A and get all of the overclocking features you need.

* 16gb of memory is way more than you could possibly use for gaming, it's a pointless buy. Get 8gb.

* GTX 780 is FAR more power than you will need for a flight simulator or an MMO. You can easilly scale down to a GTX 760 or 770 and get all the performance you need.

* You can save money by getting the Samsung 840 Evo, 256gb SSD is far more than enough.

* With the money saved, get a 2tb HDD

* With the money saved, get a RM or HX series PSU. You can go down to 550-600W if you don't plan to SLI, 750w or 860w if you do plan to SLI.

* Arguably the Fractal Design Define R4 w/Window White is a nicer case than the 600T you have selected."

Of course it's going to sell like crazy: drop a few beats, sample a few better songs, get in some features from popular artists, and have a record label that buys up tons of air time. Boom. Instant platinum.

Doesn't make him good, and it doesn't keep his music from being overrated. He's, at best, an average pop star with an extremely high opinion of himself. Pit him against any real rapper and the guy's a joke, made even more of a joke by the fact that he thinks he *is* a real rapper."

What I keep reminding myself of is that while I can drink-there is only self imposed restriction at this point-it would be so much harder to stop if I started again.  I think of the hangovers that turn into the eye-openers; I think of having no energy and the grogginess returning.  And in between those thoughts I think of what kind of life I want to build for myself from here on out.  I remind myself of the desire to finally nurture myself.

As far as being related to their ancestors, I believe that's true to an extent but not to the magnitude of pure bloodedness and superiority. Truth is all of the Balkans are genetically mixed, not only prior to the ancient civilizations forming but afterwards as well; the Balkans have been an epitome of vast migration and trade since the ancient times, imagine all the populations that came and went with the Roman Empire, the Byzantine empire, the Ottoman Empire, etc. Its idiotic to claim that you're the direct descendant of the ancient Greeks, Macedonians, Illyrians, etc. the Balkans IMO need to stop being so nationalistically obsessed with their history and focus on the future and get unstuck from the past. The only people that can understand this from my experience are those that are highly educated, but the rest seem to be wailing about whose history is whose, territorial disputes, whose more whiter/aryan....seriously if you don't believe me go on YouTube and read through the comments sections of videos related to the Balkans, it's ridiculous. For example some Macedonians consider Turks their allies and say they will help them battle Greece to take back northern Greece which used to belong to the ancient Macedonians when with that logic turkey should give Anatolia which used to belong to Ancient Greece, it's just irrational idiocy of people stuck in the past."

Jourdin,AskWomen,1388892479.0,"Here are the red flags that came up in my head as I read your post.

1: You are at a store; when I am at the store, I am not prepared to receive compliments on my body without reacting in an offended manner.

2: You're not complimenting her clothes, or her fashion sense, you're complimenting her body. This is usually not well-received, especially in the context it was given.

3: You have a wife. I understand that everyone has different degrees of openness in their relationships, but still. If she said she doesn't know if she'd be comfortable receiving a compliment like that, then I doubt she's comfortable with you complimenting *other* women like that. (Edit: Alright, you say you two have an open relationship. Take this one as a generalization.)

4: ""Those pants aren't chosen for their insulative purposes."" Okay??? So??? That doesn't mean that woman was wearing them to showcase her ass, either, and it doesn't justify you commenting on her ass.

Finally, the way you word some things in this post makes you sound like a 15 year old, not a grown man. Her ""azz"" looked ""amahzing?"" Can you not say ""ass?"" We're all adults here. (Not to mention, you said ""ass"" without difficulty throughout the rest of the post.)

To sum it up, you probably came off as a total creep. Learn from this experience and don't do it again. If you want to compliment a woman because the colors of her outfit go well together, or because she is wearing something fashionable and visually appealing *as an ensemble* (not because it makes *her* even more visually appealing), then that's great. But when you say you're complimenting her ""clothes"" and clearly have ulterior motives (come on, dude, you even admitted that you were thinking about her ass, not her pants), just keep your comments to yourself."

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1388892716.0,"Okay, so I'm not saying what he did was right, but I think I can understand why he'd say that.

It sounds like he's not comfortable with sex *at all*, so if they asked him he of course wouldn't want to tell them that he's doing something he's not comfortable with, right? It's like, if you're embarrassed to have sex you're going to lie and say you're a virgin. So he's grown up thinking that sex before marriage is bad, and still doesn't want people to know that any sexual activity is going on because even if it's ""okay,"" it's still taboo for him. 

However, he's still a guy. So if he says *he* is the one who doesn't want to have sex, then they're going to call him gay or something. That's just what those group of guys would assume. It's kind of a lose-lose deal for him.

There is probably a better way for him to have handled that, but it can weird if you're around people like that who are clearly immature. If he's uncomfortable about sex most likely *they're* bringing it up, and he's just trying to say whatever he can to get out of the conversation but not have them think less of him.

Edit: Also, if he's grown up thinking you need to wait for sex, he probably internally feels like girls should remain ""pure."" Not that he thinks any less of you, but he may have subconsciously been trying to protect you from them calling you a slut or something. Like I said, he could have handled things better, but sometimes you're in really weird situations and you don't know what to do. "

Settling is the wrong word here. Colonization would be more appropriate.

Native people in the mission system were [forced to work against their will, subjected to corporal punishment](http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/78spring/labor.htm), [raped, and murdered](http://www.cla.calpoly.edu/~coneill/es210/missions/phase3.html).

DoubleRavens,gainit,1388892950.0,"Not claiming to be an expert here or anything but I'm coming back after nearly 6 months off. Around March/April last year I started training ""properly"" and eating better too, I hit PRs and was happy with the way things were going; then I crashed. Over the last 4-5 months my training and diet has fallen apart as I got injured, then I had a chest infection, tonsilitis, ear infection, chest infection again etc etc. It took me a while to realise why I was failing but now I've got it sorted and I'm back on the wagon. It was SLEEP. Sleep is when the vast majority of repair goes on in our body and by working out I was putting EXTRA strain on my body without giving it any more time to recover (in fact I was giving it 6 or less hours a night when it needed 8 or more).

Immediate advise is to grab a deload week, try and keep up with your bulking diet as much as possible and aim for 8-10 hours sleep a night (the more the better if you're already ill!)."

I feel like OP is on the side of being the one to have high hopes, that might get hurt. As long as this girl is respectful of OP's feelings that is all that matters. I just hated being in the position of being the one who thought things could go somewhere,wanted them to and they could take it or leave it. 

In my current situation I am the one who could take it or leave it so, I don't have much emotional involvement. Since I don't have the benefit of really knowing what the other girl is after, ultimately-I suppose I shouldn't speculate on her intentions.

gerrettheferrett,OnePiece,1388893284.0,"For # 1, I find the Sky Island arc to be the purest adventure arc in the series. Alabasta comes to a close second, as it is man's romance to save a country for the sake of a princess. But, Sky Island is different from any other arc in that *they did not have to go there*.

It seems for you that is what made it boring. But for me, that is what made it pure adventure. ""What's that? There is an island in the sky?"" ""Welp, we're going there."" It goes back to the roots of the series, how Luffy wants to be the Pirate King not because he wants to beat everyone, but because the Pirate King is the freest. And what is more free than adventuring for the adventure's sake.

They go on a grand adventure, bond with Robin, and get money needed to fix the ship. Before leaving, other pirates make fun of Luffy, saying that childish dreams like his are old fashioned for today's pirates. But Luffy doesn't say anything back, and keeps on dreaming.

You mentioned that Sky Island

&gt; has like 0 influence on the rest of the world

I am fully expecting that to change. Because, if you will remember, there is a key person who knows that Luffy went to Sky Island: Blackbeard.

I expect that when Luffy and Blackbeard eventually clash (which is going to happen, Blackbeard was the one who caught Ace), this theme will come into play: men's dreams never die, and how Luffy and Blackbeard both want freedom, but diametrically opposed freedom. Sky Island being an adventure for the sake of adventuring will come into play there, I feel.

In regards to your # 3, that is what I found most interesting about the fight, as I mentioned earlier.

But, the fact that Enel still gives Luffy a decent run for his money even with the bad matchup shows that Enel is a good fighter. He thinks of roundabout ways to try and defeat Luffy.

The elemental match up made it one of the most interesting fights of the series in my opinion.

As for # 5, why introduce mantra (haki) early? To demonstrate that haki does an incredible amount of playing field leveling. Without it, Enel would have gotten his ass handed to him by Luffy. But because of it, Luffy did not have it easy.

Just like without haki, Luffy would have lost to CC.

Why did Lucci not have haki? Because, as is established, haki normally takes a very, very long time to master, and CP9 instead focused on the 6 styles, which are also used by Navy higher ups right along with haki.

As for # 6, my memory might be off because I have not watched this arc for a while, but wasn't a large reason for that because, even though he could feel Luffy's attacks with his mantra, they were a little too fast for him to do much with it. Additionally, I don't think he just straight up dropped using it. I think it is more that Oda stopped explicitly mentioning every time Enel used it."

If your reason for going back in time to tell Obama he won't get re-elected was to prevent his reelection then no matter what you do, he will win his election.

Let's say there are no altering timelines or universes and everything you do occurs on the same timeline. If you are successful and Obama loses the election, then the reason you came back in time would no longer exist. You came back in time because Obama wins, you don't like it, and want him to lose. Well if he loses, then you would have been happy about the outcome and have no need to have gone back in time in the first place, creating a paradox. Because the universe can't allow a paradox, no matter your best efforts, Obama will win his election.

that said, transition for everyone. but DEFINITELY see a therapist if you can. the best thing my therapist said to me was:

'transition isn't a jump off a cliff, it's a walk up a tall slope.'

basically, making the decision to start transition is never a finality. not that you should go into it willy nilly; know what you're getting into, but even when you start, the point of no return is a ways off. [which is why most of us regret not starting earlier. :p]

And guiltless in a sense cause he was willing to

Yes, but only if you rewrite it this way:

Rewritten, this is now:

[(3^(1))\*(3^(1))\*(3^(1))] \* [(a^(4))\*(a^(4))\*(a^(4))]

[3^(1+1+1)] \* [a^(4+4+4)]

3^(3)\*a^(12)

bermyWHAT,clothdiaps,1388893804.0,"I'm still trying to decide if it's worth it for me to get a portable washing machine (or even a small camping washing machine - although no spin) or hand wash with a wash board.

My issue is that the portable washing machine I want is $170 (the Panda one with the spinner) but will end up being around $520 by the time I get it to the island. But a schmancy proper portable washing machine is like, $575 but bigger than I had wanted...

I watched some videos on cleaning cloth diapers with a washboard and it didn't seem that bad...I'm just worried about it because I'm a first time Mum and I have no idea how tired I'll be dealing with cloth diapers and everything else might be too much at first until I establish a routine. But you're past all that...so...it might even be worth it to get the proper portable washer to do all your laundry in the long run.

I asked a similar question on /r/camping and they recommended a washing bags where you put the laundry, soap, and water in a bag-type-of-thing and you woosh it around with your hands to wash the stuff. Or there is a bucket-type of device with a hole in the lid and a plunger looking thing that you basically ""churn"" to get your laundry clean. 

There are sooo many options. I guess it depends on your budget and if you want to spend a lot of money initially or later on or even if you want to completely eliminate your need to use the communal washing room unless it's for big stuff like your bedsheets or something. But then again a schmancy portable machine should be able to wash everything and then you can line dry or just pay for dyers."

The outrage was because women shouldn't need to constantly be on guard for potential unwanted advances because guys expect them to come up with some bullshit reason for temporarily deflecting them.

To reject this is to say to all women, ""Look, if you want to be in public, then men who you are totally uninterested in are going to regularly make you uncomfortable, some of them are going to badger you for *hours* or until you leave your current location, some of them are going to flip out at you the next time they see you because you gave them a fake number to get them off your back, and that's how *I* want society to work.

If you mean that the majority of tech jobs are in the northeast, then I would have to disagree with you. The majority of non-telecom based jobs are definitely on the western coast of the US. 

Telecom based jobs are majorly in Texas, as I currently live in TX and work as an accountant for a telecom subsidiary. I learned this the hard way.

Northeast jobs consist mainly of small media based gigs, i.e. local television and music industry, the remnants of journalism and programming tech, which we all know is a personal endeavor if you are a programmer, or artistically based. 

The Midwest is mainly known for the logistics/supply chain industries, which is why if you look into where anything that you order that's USA made, hell, not even USA made, outside of tech, the distributing address will be somewhere in the midwest.

BranLandry,Drugs,1388893958.0,"Before I get into my answer, I too am going to give some background information. I'm a biology and chemistry student and research assistant. During the beginning of my university adventure, I found many people like you and I (i.e. the science-type drug users). I found it absolutely fascinating, and immediately found myself surrounded with others who had perfect GPAs yet still enjoyed drugs.

Here's where things get a little... iffy. While the drug-using community is large, our pursuit (that is, the science and knowledge route) is *very* different than that of many other drug users. This is **not** to say that we are in any way, shape or form better - only different. **But** eventually, I saw many of my friends get frustrated. ""All the *other* drug users are giving us a bad name! All they do is go to raves, watch movies and laze around all the time!"" 

While I agreed that there were many people on the other end of the spectrum who were indeed giving drugs a bad name, remember this: everyone has something to teach you. If possible, surround yourself not only by people who combine drugs and science/knowledge, but by those who do them for different reasons...

TofuRobber,changemyview,1388894419.0,"So you're saying weed can lead to and cause anxiety in a certain people/groups of people and although not scientifically proven the large number of anecdotal evidence would lend to support that argument? 

If that's all you're saying then that's probably true. Not many people, if any, can refute that claim. That still hold's no grounds to say that weed is harmful in general. Say I don't think science has caught up to it yet means nothing and stands as only an excuse. All it's saying is, I have no scientific evidence for it, but that's only because science can't test it **yet**.

Because there is no scientific research regarding those claims, they have practically no power as persuasive evidence. With that said, the most you can say is that ""I've had bad experiences with the drug"". But anybody can say that about anything. I can say that about aspirin. Would you believe me if I said that? What if I said that I don't think science have caught up to studying it yet?

Look, there could be any number of other factors that could **also** contribute to those feelings of anxiety that those users experienced: dosage, genetic strains, method of uptake, legality, personal circumstances, etc. There are too many factors to consider when using anecdotal evidence that can't be accounted for. The question, ""Is weed bad for your health?"", is not going to be answered with anecdotal evidence therefore there is no reason to even suggest using it, even if there were thousands or millions of them. That doesn't mean that those people are wrong. It just mean we can't use their experience as a basis.

To even make use of those anecdotes you'd first have to analyze them and the person whom they are connected to. How much did they take? Did they smoke it, vaporize it? Who was their provider? Were they doing it legally? Was it medical related? Were they taking other drugs? Were there any other major things in their life when they were on the drug? How often did they use it? Where did they use it? When did they use it? Why did they use it? 

It's hard enough to get any clear idea of the circumstance for just one anecdote for it to even be usable but to get it from hundreds if impossible. There there's also the fact that you have to consider this is all testimonial. To really be sure they are telling the truth they'd need to be able to verify their story with at least one other person on every aspect of the inquiry. 

As you can see it's does no good to rely on anecdotes. Your own experience will affect you greatly and you may be sure of it but a second party has no reason to take your words as truth much less the general public comprised of billions of people."

I find worrying about whether I'm ""enough"" of a man comes in waves. Especially early in transition it was really important to me. As I started 'passing' at a much higher percentage, it lessened some because, frankly...people just aren't judging me all that much. Usually.

It might also help to pay attention (if you haven't been--I hadn't) to the wide range of masculinity and maleness that exists. I used to focus too much on the tallest guy, the most built guy, the most angular guy. But most men fail to live up to that kind of pressure, so in that case at least, I am in good company."

Actually *talk to him* before deciding that you need to break up with him over this. Seriously. If you throw out every single relationship you have over one incident where it doesn't even sound like he was trying to hurt you, you're not going to have very many successful relationships. 

If you talk to him and his reaction is dicklike, ""I just felt like saying that because YOLO,"" or something, or if he's not apologetic, then yeah definitely be upset.

Lecks,TumblrInAction,1388895035.0,"&gt;Are you similarly confused by transgender people? Or Asexuals? 

I understand asexuals quite well, transgender people confuse me on a similar level as agender people though.

&gt;An analogy she briefly mentions describing asexuality - a lack of interest in sex. It's like a lack of interest in sport. It's kinda weird to say that if someone isn't interested in any sport, then they should just turn on the tv and be fine with watching any sport that comes up. Agender is kinda like this. I'm not identifying with men or women. My tv is not tuned into that channel, so saying I should like football when its on when I don't even like sports isn't quite correct. I don't identify with whats between my legs whatsoever, no matter which is between my legs. If a female agender woke up tomorrow with a dick, now they're a male agender, not a man. 

I guess I just don't understand gender identity itself. As I said, I identify as a man because my body is male, were my body female I'd identify as a woman. I wouldn't know what other characteristic by which to identify my gender. 

With transgender people I can sort of understand it, their body tells them they're a certain gender but their brain tells them it's the wrong one. That clicks with me, but the concept of agender just leaves me stumped for some reason I'm completely failing to articulate.

Anyway, I doubt this will ever make sense to me. Gender stuff has always given me a headache."

As far as Teach goes, Blackbeard was on the island with Bellamy. After Bellamy beat up Luffy, it was a drunk Blackbeard outside of the bar that told Luffy that a man's dreams never die. Right before the upstream took them to Sky Island, Blackbeard and Co were just about to attack Luffy and Co. I think it was because Blackbeard was going to take Luffy down to prove himself fit to be one of the 7 Warlords (defeating the guy who defeated the previous one is a good way to go about doing that), but then once that failed, he settled on Ace.

Once the upstream hit, Blackbeard is all like, ""Well shit. It looks like a man's dream really does not die."" (That's a paraphrase.)

As for # 5, why would Oda have had Enel call it haki? It was established that Sky Island was an entirely separate culture. Things had entirely different names up there. They did not even know what rubber is.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to me that haki as earth dwellers know it would be largely unknown there, maybe even considered a gift from the gods, and have a different name."

myrrlyn,ideasfortheadmins,1388895105.0,"Alright. Little lesson in how HTML works.

When you type `2. List stuff` with NOT `&lt;li&gt;` elements around it, Markdown sees this and goes ""Oh, of course! Clearly he wants to make an `&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;` pattern!"" And then your BROWSER sees it and makes the first `&lt;li&gt;` tag display 1, or I, or A, or a, or whatever CSS decrees that the li shall be, but it's the FIRST ONE.

This will always. always. always. be true. Because that's how HTML works. This will only ever change when HTML changes its list definitions.

I gave you both a way to make Markdown do what you want and an explanation as to why it wasn't.

This is not reddit's fault; it is not Markdown's fault. You told Markdown to make an ordered list, and it did. Your browser creates the 1's. Not Markdown, not reddit. Markdown reads your plaintext and tells reddit what HTML tags they mean, and reddit feeds those HTML tags to your browser, where the numbers are made. You won't find said numbers in the HTML source.

**It has everything to do with HTML tags; it is not terrible design or a software bug. It is you not using the system properly.**"

about 8 months later, I get a nasty letter stating that since I hadn't provided proof of insurance, they have suspended my license and are reporting me to the police. After I get that whole pile of stupid sorted out (by faxing them a copy of the police report and the insurance card), a month later I get another nasty letter from them stating that I owed them for a shitload of parking tickets. 

After the car was totaled, the insurance company sold it to a junkyard. Alaska DMV fucked up the paperwork, and still had it in my name. I had to spend about 4 hours on the phone trying to convince the dipshit lady at the DMV that the car was not mine, despite what the insurance company was telling them.

RichardBehiel,spacex,1388895339.0,"**First stage:**  It's looking pretty likely.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if SpaceX managed to get a first stage to land back on the pad within the next few years.  The real question, though, is how much it will cost to get the stage refurbished and ready to fly again.  Keep in mind the shuttle was reusable, but we all know how much money that saved...

One thing to remember regarding reusability is that the cost of building and refurbishing the rocket has to be amortized over the total number of launches that the rocket is capable of.  As mbhnyc pointed out, ~~10~~ ~3 minutes of burning LOX + RP1 really takes its toll on an engine; how many times can a Merlin withstand that? 

So the idea that rocket launches can be brought down orders of magnitude to $200,000, the cost of the fuel, is probably a pipe dream (I hope I'm wrong).  Still, a reusable first stage would sharply cut launch costs and give SpaceX a huge competitive advantage.  

**Second stage:** I'd say 90% chance it will never happen.  It's just not worth it.  A thousand pounds added to the first stage takes 250 pounds out of your payload, but a thousand pounds added to the second stage takes a full thousand pounds out of your payload.  Ouch.  

Furthermore, the second stage is traveling much faster than the first stage, which complicates things; either you need a stronger retrograde burn to drastically slow it back down (fuel mass taken away from your payload), or you'll need a heat shield on the second stage (heat shield mass taken away from your payload).  In short, second stage reusability is possible, but not practical.  

Edit: Just had a thought.  Reusing the second stage only brings back one Merlin, as opposed to the nine in the first stage.  So not only is the second stage more difficult and expensive (in terms of payload capacity decrease) to recover, but you also only get a ninth the amount of engines that a first stage gives you.  Does anyone know how much a Merlin costs relative to the rest of the first/second stages?"

Granted, I've been this way for a while, not because of philosophy, but a lack of funds. Now it's about philosophy.

I bought my 360 in 2008ish, and I've been having a blast playing older, really good games. I just got a ps3 for $199, plus many games which are exclusives for only $10-15 a game.

Constrictorboa,Winnipeg,1388895451.0,"I come from a long line of commercial fishermen. I personally would NEVER eat burbot. Burbot are also called ""mariah"" and they are bottom-feeders like catfish and bullheads. I've eaten a few in the past but I had no choice. It was 35 below zero and we had no food other than the burbot. The only reason people say they taste like lobster is because both are served dipped in butter. I can't tell you what to eat but I am personally disgusted by bottom-feeder fish. Stick with fresh, lake-caught pickerel aka walleye. Also, do not eat anything caught in the Red River. Pollution filled river fish are gross. Try Grand Rapids up north. Ask around as to what time of year is best. I personally get the best results in early spring and late fall when the water temp is low. The local commercial fisherman sometimes will sell you all the cheeks you can cut out yourself for dirt cheap since the usually discard the heads. If you get more adventurous take a canoe north of the 54th parallel and hit up lakes that haven't been fished in years. Flin Flon area (not near town, the lakes all around) has served me well. Be prepared to get spoiled though. Sometimes I'll go three casts without a fish and I'll be genuinely confused about why it's taking so long lol"

Slim chance of a (probably treatable) STD/pregnancy, *very* slim chance of a rape/assault accusation. That's about it. If you're just looking for a one time thing, those are favorable odds.

In the vast majority of cases, a man's reputation and personal safety would hardly be threatened by this girl. To many men, her erratic nature would appear more a threat to herself that anyone else. Men fear rejection from women more than anything. The pain of getting brushed off by this halfwit is zilch. So: zero (legitimate) risk.

That being said, it's not a very believable profile. The author is setting herself up to attract the credulous and self-deluding. I have no doubt that she is ""from the internet"" as her experiment reflects the kind of bias-confirming, echo chamber thinking to which the web so readily caters."

I just... I have a boyfriend who sometimes struggles socially in weird situations and I know he would have done just as well handling this as your boyfriend (so not well). That doesn't make him a bad boyfriend, and that doesn't mean he disrespects me. It means that he doesn't know how to react in certain situations and sometimes does the wrong thing not even realizing it. If he apologized and asked what he could do to improve,  that's not a lack of maturity. That's him accepting he fucked up and wanting to improve, and there is nothing immature about that.

Not everybody knows how to handle certain social situations well. If this is something he struggles with it's better to help him then to just call quits. Like I said, if it's about sexual incompatibility that's one thing. However, I don't think this situation should play a role in your decision."

Studies do show that children of divorced parents do perform worse in school and are less successful in life, but when accounting for various factors, the conclusion is simply that it is better to be raised by two parents rather than one.

So, I think it is safe to say that on average, a child raised by two parents (whether they were married, divorced, gay, adopted, or biologically grandparents) would likely make a better partner regardless of gender.  

That said, the variance is so wide and individuals are so different that attempting to use such a generalization in dating preferences is pretty much worthless."

I thought he was making shit up, I am so sorry I am not fluent in [le] STEM, and I responded to the question later down the road anyway.

&gt;I have masturbated. Does this make me a murderer? Women have spontaneous abortions all the time. Does this make them murderers?

Sperm are not people and miscarriages are not intentional. Exercise some common sense.

&gt;There aren't two people. There never were two people. You even admitted it yourself. Why would there be a ""brother"" waiting in heaven when the ""brother"" never existed in the first place?

No, I never ""admitted"" anything, I speculated about unusual cases and used consistent reasoning.

&gt;Like I said, you've answered nothing. 

No, what you mean is, I've answered nothing in a way that makes you feel smug and victorious. I've been having a very intelligent discussion with this person, who is capable of exercising common sense and not taking a slightly miscommunicated question and translating it into masturbation is genocide.

&gt;You're using black-and-white thinking to answer questions when you need many shades of grey.

Because that's the way it is. A = A, reality is objective, and no matter how much you want it cannot be spun into an incoherent relativist fairytale that tries to make A = A and A = B when B != A.

My late uncle had the Sacred Writings collection of the holy books from the major world religions--the New Testament, the Tanakh (Old Testament), the Rig Veda, the Quran, and of course the Dhammapada. When he died and his books were passed along to me, I read them all, with the Tanakh (mostly the Wisdom books) and the Dhammapada being my favorites. 

It wasn't till later that I took up a more intentional Buddhist practice, but reading the Dhammapada and meditating occasionally with candles and incense as a teenager always kept Buddhism in the back of my mind."

I often only communicate what I feel is absolutely necessary; though my mind is often abuzz with many different things, it is difficult for me to tell others of what is going on in there. Don't automatically assume that a lack of communication is a lack of frustration, but rather can be their nature.

at that point he either has to take away the shot or the pass, he took the shot away from the puck handler, then its on holtby to make a save and guess what...

.545 obviously aint gonna cut it, and he was playing like shit before he got benched and grubi played well so dont act like he sat for 2 weeks for no reason.

i used to be a big defender of holtby, but i'm tired of it, he sucked early in the year, he played well for a little while and hes sucking again. so many teams can hope for their goalie to put up a performance like ryan miller did against us where they just stand on their head DESPITE poor defense and win it single handed, and right now i'm just praying that holtby can manage to *just* give up 3 goals in a game.

Neither does asking the most common-sense deprived questions possible. Use the ""reason"" and ""logic"" you adore to make conclusions based on what is read.

&gt;So if there is no God, then there are no objective morals, is that what you're getting at?

Yes, that is exactly what I am getting at. It is an untenable position to be an atheist and believe in morality.

&gt;The same people who oppose Christianity as the basis of the state, who oppose the so-called Christian state, do not tire of repeating that morality is ""the fundamental pillar of social life and of the state."" As if the dominion of morality were not a complete dominion of the sacred, a ""hierarchy.""

Or perhaps you might like:

&gt;Right - is a wheel in the head, put there by a spook; power - that am I myself, I am the powerful one and owner of power. Right is above me, is absolute, and exists in one higher, as whose grace it flows to me: right is a gift of grace from the judge; power and might exist only in me the powerful and mighty.

That's like my boyfriend. He's always been so confident and outgoing and it wasn't until recently that I learned he sometimes doesn't fully get certain social situations. I'm so used to him being so bubbly and out there that it doesn't occur to me that he is not Mr. Perfect when it comes to interacting with certain people. 

I highly doubt your boyfriend wanted them to treat you like that, and I'm sure if he knew what the outcome would be he'd find something else to say (or just stand there silently). 

Definitely don't interact with those guys again. They're dicks. *They're* the ones that made fun of you, not your boyfriend. I'm sure it's hard for him to put up with them at work as well. 

Sex is definitely a tricky subject, but in this situation it seems to be more about him being pressured and confused by assholes then him trying to hurt you or anything. Once again, if you can't handle not having sex then don't stay with him. However, if your boyfriend doesn't do something like this again and understands why you're upset, then try not to factor this in too heavily. "

ThisIsDave,MachineLearning,1388896468.0,"It largely depends on what assumptions you're willing to make.

If you think your samples are distributed from a relatively simple distribution with known properties (e.g. it's univariate Gaussian or Poisson or whatever), you can often do quite well for some purposes with 10-50 samples.

If you make your distribution more flexible (e.g. conditioning it on some high-dimensional measurements, adding mixture components, making the predictions higher-dimensional) then you'll need more data.  Sometimes you'll even need *exponentially* more data to get the same level of precision as you would have gotten in the simpler case. If your priors are weak enough, some statisticians will say you should have 10-50 data points *per parameter.*

If you're willing to constrain the model more tightly (e.g. with strong priors) then you won't need as many data points. Some methods will even work with more data points than parameters.  Machine learning folks tend to be more comfortable in this area than statisticians. But strong constraints like these can require making some fairly strong assumptions about the data-generating process (e.g. that most effects are negligibly small and your overall outcome is dominated by a few key factors).

---

**What will go wrong if you have too few samples for your model?**

It depends:

1) The best case scenario, in a Bayesian framework like yours, is that you end up with a very flat posterior.  So you can't say much about any of your parameters or make very precise predictions, but at least you're not *wrong.*  Information criteria and cross-validation are both good ways to get a sense of whether your model is too complex.

2) You can get a wrong or meaningless answer.  Maybe your Markov chains don't converge to the posterior distribution or your optimization routine gets stuck.  Maybe you get [zero variance](https://faculty.washington.edu/jmiyamot/bayes/gelmana%20prior%20distributions%20f%20variance%20parameters%20i%20hierarchical%20mods.pdf) for some important parameter that should obviously vary. Maybe your priors weren't as weak as you thought (on some scale) and your posterior distribution just ends up repeating what you already told the model. Some of these things are easy to diagnose, but others can be very subtle.

-----

In short, tread carefully, and look hard for evidence of pathological results.  Even if you think you need all the complexity (multivariate mixtures etc.), start simple and work your way up.  Simulate from the data-generating process your model describes and make sure you could recover the correct parameters.  Look for ways to simplify the model (e.g. tying some parameters together or setting some covariances to zero) or to get prior information from other sources.

Good luck!"

Fallout 3 was one of my first serious gaming experiences.  On one of my journeys through the wastes, I found something terrifying.  At the time I played, I had yet to realize that monsters are less likely to spawn along the roads and thus decided to just travel straight over the wastes.

I remember as I crossed through an area full of radioactive pools, suddenly being hit from the side.  I turn to face what attacked me and nearly jumped out of my chair.  I have a fear of arachnids, so imagine how I felt coming face to face with a radscorpion the first time.

At the time, I was still a fairly low level.  Little ammo and mostly weak guns.  For role play reasons, I was using a 10mm pistol as my primary (character preferred pistols in general).  So I proceed to back-pedal away in fear while firing away.  Before long, I'd blown through all my pistol ammo.  The scorpion is still coming.  For a moment, I abandon character and I switch out to a hunting rifle.  Before I know it, all my .32s are gone from my wild shooting.  And that darn scorpion is still coming.  Now I switch over to my assault rifle, and proceed to fire away.  Filly, I kill the thing...and only have one clip of 5.56s left.

michaellicious,AskReddit,1388896743.0,"I'm gay so prepare yourself. The first dick that I took was huge, like monster can size. I started to suck it but my teeth wouldn't stop touching his shaft. It seemed like he didn't mind, so I just rolled with it. Then he started to force deepthroat me onto it until I gagged. When he wanted to penetrate me he didn't prep at all. No fingering, no stretching nothing. The worst part? He used lotion as lube. The only thing I could bear was his tip, and even that made me limp around for 3 days (I should've mentioned that I told him to stop after this and pull out). I guess I have to be somewhat grateful that he didn't rape me as he had all the strength to take advantage of me.

Tl;Dr: make sure he plays with your ass beforehand gay guys.

Edit: I should've mentioned that I'm naturally submissive so I was kinda into it. Don't worry about if it was rape, it was consentual. Until the last part.

By the way, the body can run off of fat and protein and a small amount of glucose... it's called ketosis.

mjohnson062,buccaneers,1388896871.0,"These continued comments of ""his system"" and ""Tampa 2"" are driving me absolutely insane.

I used to love bologna and cheese sandwiches, but one day, I found that we were out of bologna, so I made a PBJ and it was awesome!  I did **not** try turn the PB into bologna, I realized that was silly and instead looked for a way to best use the PB and found some jelly!

See what I did there?

Coaches who must use *their* system are idiots and I don't believe Lovie is an idiot.  I also don't believe that in it's purest form, the Tampa 2 works in today's NFL, particularly against QB's who are very accurate and have many solid receivers (ie, the entire NFC South).

Honestly, I've had some discussions around the possibility of us switching to a 3-4 defense (get a big nose tackle, McCoy becomes a DE along with someone opposite and we likely have enough LB's, who don't need to be as versatile overall as they specialize inside vs rush).

EDIT:  Just because Florio and everyone else at PFT says ""he'll run a Tampa 2"" doesn't make it so, they don't really know jack-shit about football and simply aggregate sports news and rumors while applying their often uninformed opinions."

hubeijames,nba,1388896927.0,"Nope. Hinkie is from the Morey school of highly valuing 2nd round picks. A non-lottery first rounder isn't that much more valuable than a 2nd rounder. This is because 2nd round picks offer much more salary flexibility for their rookie contracts, and non-lottery first rounders are already pretty unlikely to get you an impact player. The difference in quality between the 17th and the 47th picks aren't as much as you'd think: both picks have a low probability of producing valuable NBA players. Sometimes the salary flexibility is more valuable than the slight increase in chance of getting a good player out of a low-value pick.

My guess is Hinkie would almost certainly prefer to give the Heat a non-lottery first rounder than two second-rounders."

Modern humans are very diverse phenotypically despite being very genetically homogenous and as the Georgian fossils show, our ancestors were equally diverse. I think there has been a tendency to want to make the human family tree look bushy (I am looking at you, Ian Tattersal!) as a subconscious reaction against misconceptions of human evolution as a linear progression. Also a factor is that finding and describing a new hominin species is seen as the path to the Big Time in Paleoanthropology, which tends to inflate species numbers (hence all the spurious taxa like *Australopithicus garhi* and *Homo antecessor*).

IMO there are only 2 species of *Homo*, *H. erectus* and *H. sapiens* (the latter including Neandertals and *H. heidelbergensis*), 2 species of gracile australopithecine (*A. afarensis* and *A. africanus*) and 2 species of robust australopithecine (*P. aethiopicus* and *P. robustus*).

Jeffreyrock,philosophy,1388897254.0,"I'm an idealist so my view is going to be the opposite, namely that matter emerged from consciousness.  To quote Cambridge physicist Sir James Jeans:  ""Today there is a wide measure of agreement which, on the physical side of science, approaches almost to unanimity that the stream of knowledge is heading towards a non-mechanical reality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than a great machine. Mind no longer appears as an accidental intruder into the realm of matter; we are beginning to suspect that we ought rather to hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter-- not, of course, our individual minds, but the mind in which the atoms out of which our individual minds have grown to exist as thoughts...The new knowledge compels us to revise our hasty first impressions that we had stumbled into a universe which either did not concern itself with life or was actively hostile to life. The old dualism of mind and matter, which was mainly responsible for the supposed hostility, seems likely to disappear, not through matter becoming in any way more shadowy or insubstantial than heretofore, or through mind becoming resolved into a function of the working of matter, but through substantial matter resolving itself into a creation and manifestation of mind.""

Damn, those games are amazing. They have the characters you know and love alongside a cast of goofily stupid/oblivious to the mustacioed plumber with Mario being two dimensions living in a 3D world (and the second game takes full advantage of this). You make friends, some of which are awesome fighting partners and everyday companions while others are just slightly ridiculous but necessary. Just complex for you to be interested in the depths that can be explored, and the depth can engulf you. The first game can take about 30 hours your first time through, and the fastest I've done it in has bee about 20 hours; additionally, the second is extensive and will take you more time than reading *War and Peace*, for it will occupy over 100 hours of your life the first time it is played.

Omega037,changemyview,1388897362.0,"In any system as large as the criminal justice system, there will always be aberrations and incidents that fall well outside the normal standard deviation.  

While these events are especially attention grabbing (in large part *due* to being extremely unusual), it is best not to use these exceedingly rare examples as the basis of policy.  Furthermore, it is very unlikely that you have all the facts or that the facts are being correctly reported to you.

The vast majority of people who are arrested and convicted of murder with intent serve very long or life sentences.  Most jurisdictions require a minimum of 25 to life for premeditated murder, so there is no possibility of ""getting off easy"".

That said, there are many mitigating factors.

Like you said, insanity can be a defense, but it is an incredibly high bar to reach.  You have to show conclusively that the person has a very serious mental condition that made you incapable of making decisions.  

In other words, you are saying that the person was *incapable of intent or malice*, so it doesn't meet your definition.  Furthermore, these people are sent to psychiatric facilities for an indefinite period, which for most is a life sentence.

Other factors can also come into play.  What if a person is only 11 years old when they kill someone, should they be treated the same as an adult and executed?  What if they were heavily coerced by a violent physical and sexual abuser to commit the crime?  What if the person they are killing is their abuser?  

Not to mention, sometimes we have to make deals to get any amount of justice.  If a person is going to almost certainly walk due to lack of evidence, isn't it better to get them to confess in exchange for limiting the sentence to 20 years?

As for executions themselves, there have been countless numbers of people sent to prison for murder who have later been found to be innocent.  A person if prison for life has basically forfeited the majority of their life existence.  The only thing executing them does is basically say that the state *never* makes mistakes so we don't need to be careful or allow an appeals process. "

frsp,DebateReligion,1388897364.0,"&gt; How would it constrain it? As tribal animals, a sense of morality aids us, in both survival and quality of life.

To play the character of an egoist, certainly there is a certain usefulness in minding our own business and getting along, and occasionally uniting as fellow egoists to admire our mutual brutality, but the idea of morality is merely a means of domination of the unworthy over the strong, as much as religion, capitalism, and the state is. There is no right but might.

&gt;If it were proved to you that there is no God, would you stop having a negative reaction to murder and theft, and start considering them just fine?

I might have negative emotional reactions if it affected me directly, but emotions are just chemical reactions, are they not? It's all completely meaningless. Furthermore, as the ego, the only one, die Einzige, I have power to claim my own, my property, mein Eigentum. The weakness of others is a sign of their own failures, why should I take pity on a useless animal?

Assuming you've got that, I saw great forearm results by altering my grip on pull ups.

Whenever I transitioned to a finger based grip my forearm strength and size started going up tremendously. When they tire out, I switch to a palm grip to complete a set, but otherwise it has worked wonders."

SublethalDose,socialskills,1388897394.0,"&gt; Actually, it doesn't seem commonplace at all. I don't ever shake hands with people my age, or see them shaking hands with one another.

This is a good standard to apply.  Definitely keep an eye out for how people around you touch each other.  American culture (I'm assuming you're American) isn't very touchy-feely, so touching is often interpreted as inappropriately intimate even when it isn't meant that way.  See the answers on [my AskWomen question](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1ud4lq/how_do_you_feel_about_a_casual_hand_on_the_back/), where a slight majority said they found a casual touch on the back to be too intimate for someone they weren't dating, even though a large minority said they were fine with it.  All the more reason to take a dance class where there's a lot of socially sanctioned touching.  You won't have much opportunity to desensitize yourself in your normal social life unless you start dating a lot or trying to pick up women in clubs.

A lot of the advice floating around on the internet is based on trying to pick up women, a goal towards which it can actually be advantageous to take a fairly aggressive and cookie-cutter approach, so you can quickly find out which women are down to get physical right away.  Women who aren't into it will be forced to show their displeasure so you can move on, and women who were hoping you'd get physical will think you're a sexy, sexy mind reader.  It isn't necessarily a good approach to take to your social life in general.

They asked me had I ever thought about God, and they showed me the bit in the Bible that said that everything the Bible says is true.
I told them I was agnostic. They seemed to be unsure of what that meant, so I defined it for them. 

We were having quite an interesting, friendly chat, and then he tried to give me a pamphlet or a copy of Watchtower.
I told him that I would read it if he would read something of mine, some atheist pamphlets that I kept near the door for just such an occasion. 
""How the Gods were Made"" published by the Socialist Party of Great Britain, an atheist pamphlet by Emma Goldman, a pamphlet copy of ""God and the State"" by Bakunin, and another one by someone I forget.

Suddenly he looked really offended, almost disgusted. He told me he didn't want to read any atheistic literature as he was ""convinced"" of the truth of the message of his church.
So the conversation came to an awkward end and no literature was exchanged.

Of course, it would be too much to expect of these people to put themselves in someone else's shoes and to think that I might be equally ""convinced"" in my agnosticism. As irritated as he seemed at the idea of reading some pamphlets, it probably never occurred to him that people might be equally irritated when people come to their door at tea-time and offer them literature in which they have no interest.

But outside... on the good days, it is sunny, but not too sunny, as clouds drift lazily through the sky, occasionally covering up the sun, occasionally allowing it to warm you. And you look up and see a dozen raptors circling overhead while you sit at a belay ledge. You catch the sunset on the way down the mountain, to your camp where you recount the day's adventures to other climbers from the area and beyond, while eating a massive dinner of hamburgers that you packed into camp frozen the day before, and having a couple cheap beers or shots of whisky, and maybe a bowl, before everyone wanders off to bed to do it all again the next day.

On the not-so-good days, you'll end up climbing through clouds in 50 degrees, in complete silence, save for the sound of your breathing and your gear clinking as you move up the rock. You are going slow, and you run out of time, benighted on a belay ledge just big enough for you to rest your head on the wall, while your partner rests his head on you.You wake up at 4 am, and both agree you are too cold to stay still any longer, and you decide to just night climb out. After a few pitches made more difficult by having to find them in the dark, the sun slowly brightens the fog around you. As you make the final exhausting pitches to the top of the wall. You plod down the mountain, the pine branches soaking you to the bone. After an eternity of zombie-like walking, you reach camp, where you find you left your extra socks out to dry the day before. But you brew a good pot of coffee, and let it warm you and wake you up while you eat a breakfast of instant grits and scoops of peanut butter. At least you have some energy now.

At my second visit, he also took x-rays of the specific area I was specifying. But he said nothing was there. So I'm rightfully worrying that over a few weeks a pain has cropped up that seems to have no tangible cause. (Unless it's somehow still a residual effect of the gums.)"

Terron Armstead had a huuuuge game. The only time his assignment touched Drew was when the play broke down. That kid was thrown into the fire when there was no margin for error, and he's played beautifully since halftime of the Carolina game.

Teams need solid play in the trenches to make playoff runs. We may have that now. I criticized the move by Payton to start Terron so late in the season, but he knew he had to light a fire under this team's ass after the Rams game. He's tired of the ""can't win on the road"" shit everyone is saying. Well, guess what. We just won on the road, in the cold, IN THE PLAYOFFS!!

The notion that men lose sexual attraction for women that throw themselves at them is generally only true of average to above average looking women going for men with many options who would generally be considered ""out of her league"", and in which case, the man probably wouldn't have been interested in the woman anyway.

balathustrius,mead,1388898064.0,"Sorry you're having issues. Two stages of reply here - actionable advice and future batch advice.

Actionable advice: Leave those bottles alone! Provided that they are corked, leave them on their side as usual until (at least) 3 days before you are going to open one. The sediment *will* eventually fall out of suspension and settle on the downward side of the bottle. If you gently set it upright a few days before opening, that sediment will fall to the bottom. Don't shake it up if you can help it before opening, and you can give it the ol' [homebrew pour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyXn4UBjQkE). If they're crown capped, just leave them upright and (again) try not to disturb them too much before homebrew pouring.

If you mess with it at this stage, you're taking an exceptionally high risk of oxidizing the whole mess and being very disappointed.

Future batches: Allow the mead to clear before bottling. I call my mead clear enough to bottle when I rack it off the last of the lees and nothing else noticeable drops out over the course of two weeks to a month. After you reach that stage, rack *one more time* and leave 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch in the bottom via the cap on the end of your racking cane. From the fresh carboy, bottle normally. 

*Then* come back to those dregs. Bottle as much as you can and mark it ""dregs."" You will probably notice a big taste difference between that bottle and the others. If you let it sit for a couple of months, you'll also see far more sediment form in that one than the others. It's still drinkable, but it isn't a gift or show-off bottle."

sw1n3flu,Games,1388898196.0,"I hated Dota 2 at first as well, but that's because the game isn't any fun until you pass the learning curve as well as get out of the lower matchmaking bracket. By surpass the learning curve I don't mean just learn the goal and feel of the game, because Dota's learning curve is one of the most difficult that I've ever seen. Becoming decent at the game requires knowledge of every single hero's strengths/weaknesses, knowing how to do things like ward/execute ganks, and understanding what item would be useful on your hero at any given situation. If you don't like relying on other players, stressful situations, or simply don't have a lot of free time, I wouldn't recommend the game. However, if you aren't hampered by any of those then it can become your favorite game by far. I'm really happy that I continued to learn about the game even though I hated it, because now I've played 944 hours and haven't looked back.

What my problem is is that during my FIRST visit, he told me how to help gingivitis... those thigns I've been doing. And by appearance it's already starting to go away. My gums don't bleed anymore from flossing, etc. I even had him do a cleaning to remove tartar. The problem is that even though it looks better, and my gums don't bleed anymore... it's still painful. And he claims that there's nothing else wrong in that area. So I'm rightfully panicking over a mysterious pain that came out of nowhere and shows no signs of abating, even though the gingivitis has been lessening. 

My dentist himself says that it's not the cavities causing pain. He took an X-ray of the specificarea, and... claims it's not anything else, either. Okay then. So if my gingivitis is already healing, but the pain is still there, and it's not a cavity, then what is it? One of the only things that helps whenever it's painful is rolling up a paper and stuffing it in there."

ixAp0c,skateboarding,1388898432.0,"There's going to be a big difference between wheels suitable for street skating (skating street obstacles) and wheels designed to cruise around.

Most cruiser wheels are around 80a in durometer, where most street skating wheels are 95a (softer like Spitfire Soft D) to 101a (harder) durometer.  

Street wheels are usually harder so they can slide, so if you land a trick crooked you can slide after you land to straighten out your momentum.  If you land crooked on a softer wheel, the wheel grips the ground a lot more, and throws you off balance.  

You only mainly have to worry about landing crooked if you are doing rotational tricks, where the board spins, or if you are doing a grind where the board hits the ground a bit off to the side from the direction you are going.

You could still cruise around on some softer wheels and ollie, kickflip, etc., but pop-shuvits and 180s etc. are going to have to be pretty perfect to not throw yourself off balance.  

Softer wheels grip the ground more, and are a bit slower than hard wheels, but can roll over more terrain like old bumpy roads.

Harder wheels slide more, but can't ride too well on sidewalk or tarmac and shitty pavement, the concrete has to be relatively smooth and not bumpy.  


If you are skating from spot to spot all the time and have a long way to go, just get a second set of wheels and bearings (having a second set of bearings will make wheel changes a lot faster) and have a pair of cruiser wheels on the board, and street wheels in a backpack to swap out.  

If you have a car or your skate spots are close, etc., you could just get by with one set of Bones STF.  They can ride over a lot of terrain my old wheels couldn't but nothing rolls over shitty pavement like soft wheels. "

If you've read Ken Schramm's *The Compleat Meadmaker* he mentions that he heats the must, but he has since shifted entirely to no-heat for anything except braggots and the like.

Edit: Sources for Ken Schramm (of Schramm's Mead, and a founding father of the Mazer Cup International Mead Competition) advocating no-heat methods.

[Optimizing Honey Fermentation(2005)](http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/attachments/0000/1256/NDzym05_MasterMead.pdf) - No to extremely low amounts of viable bacteria in 100 ml of tupelo must.

[Mead Success: Ingredients, Processes and Techniques (1995)](http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/attachments/0000/1305/Springzym95-Mead.pdf) - Mentions sulfiting must as advantageous over heating.

[An Analysis of Mead, Mead Making and the Role of its Primary Constituents (199x?)](http://www.bjcp.org/mead/analysis.html)
&gt;The compounds dominating the list [of aromatic compounds] are phenolic in nature, and could account for some of the phenolic character attributed to meads, particularly young meads. *Most of these compounds have boiling points below 180 F*, and would be subject to rapid blow-off during boiling.

They all loved my truck and the shirt, so I became their best friend immediately.  I needed to get the exhaust system entirely redone on the truck due to rust.  (This truck grew up in the midwest so super snowy/salty roads.)  They pointed me to a repair shop in the area that got everything done parts/labor for under $200.

Basically, if you need to find a good auto shop, talk to people at Napa.  They deal with auto shops all day every day.  They know who is trustworthy and fair.

&gt;So nothing subjective means anything to us? We can't hold strong opinions about subjective issues?

Subjective issues are morally inconsequential, and if there is no morality, well...

&gt;No, I mean that all that was there was meaningless platitudes. Prove your God's morals are true.That's all I'm asking. 


1. Everything that naturally exists can be deduced to have a natural purpose.

2. Interfering with this natural purpose can be demonstrated to be detrimental to the human person.

3. Therefore, it is reasonable to speak of a natural law that should be followed.

4. Furthermore, even these things without intelligence exist for an end, and work towards this end, non-intelligently yet always achieving it.

5. Whatever lacks intelligence cannot be moved to an intelligent end without intelligence, such as an archer shooting an arrow to its end on the target.

6. Therefore, everything exists and is directed by and for an ultimate intelligent end. This is God.

* Day 1: 
Squats (w/ dumbbells)
Bench (machine)
Dumbbell Rows (...w/ dumbbells)
Hammer Curls (w/ dumbbells)

* Day 2:
Squats (w/ dumbbells)
Shoulders (machine bench - same exercise as above)
Reverse Curls (w/dumbbells)
Triceps (standing position - w/ dumbbells)

Day 2 also calls for Deadlifts, but I have an old back injury (at 25... it's sad), so I cut those out for a while since it started hurting again.

- Use enough water to cover the eggs and bring to a boil
- Pour the boiling water into a pan that will hold all of the eggs and let the water cover the eggs.
- Using a slotted spoon, gently place the eggs in the hot water and cover for 6 minutes.
- Take them out and let them cool for about 30 seconds or so until they're handleable.
- Crack them in the middle and into a dish.

Playing them with friends is significantly less stressful, and much more fun.

* Tying into the previous point, I have new-found love for Pokemon. Thanks to how simple it is to dig into the deep mechanics this time around, my friends and I have been able to breed and raise Pokemon to fit whatever role we want for them.

But anyways, technically yes. Hitler and his wife died of suicide and the Tigers won the World Series. So let's say you go back to Berlin in 1945, you find Hitler holed up and kill him. Then you bang his wife and kill her (assuming she's a sick fuck and watching her husband die is a turn on). You want the Cubs to win, but leave it alone and just return to the present.

Assuming the butterfly effect is bullshit, Hitler and his wife still died in Berlin and the Tigers still won the Series. Your original reasons for going back into the past still exist in this timeline so your current self would still go back in time to kill Hitler and his wife and want the Cubs to win the series. Plus, since you no longer exist in 1945 after you leave, everyone still assumes Hitler and his wife committed suicide and no major historical events changed. Your reason for going back in time still exists and the current you would still make the journey.

brvheart,sports,1388898958.0,"For the people that don't get the references: (Obviously some are open for interpretation, but this should help you get some jokes.  Generally the actual people are QB's on their respective teams.  Quarterbacks are widely (and correctly) regarded as the most important position in NFL football, so the QB's are often the ""face"" of the franchise.

**NFC West**

49ers  - QB Colin Kaepernick.  He owns a pet tortoise.

Seahawks - QB Russell Wilson (on balloon).  The Seahawks are better than everyone.  Wilson is a young player and already out performing the rest of the division and league.

Rams - Terrible team, so they constantly get draft picks.  The player isn't important in this case.

Cardinals - Carson Palmer #3 is reaching for Russell Wilson because he wishes he was that good.


**NFC South**

Falcons - Terrible.  Matt Ryan is burning in a piano.  (I don't understand the piano reference, but I'm assuming it has something to do with Ryan being highly paid, and under performing)

Panthers - Cam Newton on the left is a good QB, and he's doing his ""Superman"" pose, which he does after scoring.

Saints - The player (QB Drew Brees) is irrelevant, as the ""joke"" is the Saints fans always dress up crazy because they are from party town New Orleans.

Buccaneers	- Terrible team.  Rookie QB is on an IV.


**NFC North**

Packers - QB Aaron Rodgers was hurt for several weeks this year.  Cheese head because of fans in Wisconsin.

Vikings - QB Christian Ponder is widely considered not good.  They drew him retarded here.

Bears	- QB Jay Cutler is widely viewed as not caring about anyone but himself.  He was also hurt for a lot of the season.

Lions - QB Matt Stafford has a lot of energy and it's not always directed at being a good player.  He's not a declared homosexual.  The rainbow is just a joke.


**NFC East**	

Redskins - QB RG3 is being crushed by the unjustly large expectations of a crazy owner.

Giants - Eli Manning should be throwing INT's and pouting, but they have just depicted him as looking joyful and getting lots of draft picks because the Giants are terrible.

Cowboys - The joke here is that owner Jerry Jones cares more about himself and the new 1.2 billion dollar stadium than the actual product on the field.

Eagles - QB Nick Foles is breathing life into an Eagles team that few thought would be good after QB Michael Vick got injured.  (of course they lost in their playoff game today against the Saints, so their season is over.)


**AFC West**

Chargers - QB Philip Rivers has 7 kids with his wife, and they probably aren't done having kids.  (he might be Mormon or Catholic.  I'm not going to bother looking this up.)

Broncos - QB Peyton Manning has a huge forehead.

Raiders - The Player (could be anyone since it's irrelevant to the joke) is waving the surrender flag, because the Raiders are terrible.

Chiefs - They have had a much better than expected year.  Their QB #11, Alex Smith, has been playing fairly well this season.  There isn't a joke here.


**AFC South**

Texans - Terrible.

Titans - Terrible.	

Colts	- Only decent team in their division.

Jaguars - Terrible.


**AFC East**	

Patriots - The joke here is that they are the only good team in the division.

Dolphins - Not great.

Jets	- Not good.

Bills - Bad.


**AFC North**

Ravens - Biggest rival is the Steelers.  They are wrestling here.

Steelers - Biggest rival is the Ravens.  QB is a rapist.

Bengals - Had a great year.  Young team with lots of upside.  No real rival in division.  Browns would be - since they are in the same state - but the Browns are so bad, that the Bengals have no rival.

Browns - Terrible.  Always terrible.  Fans are super loyal to a terrible terrible team.

Last time I was there, driving in the left-most lane, the red mustang in front of me was just cruising along at ~75 mph, when I noticed a massive number of brake lights up ahead. All traffic was completely stopped. The driver of the red mustang didn't notice this, because they kept barreling ahead, and I was reading the traffic, so I began to brake. 

The mustang finally realized traffic was stopped as it was still traveling full speed, 2-3 car lengths away from the car in front of it, so at the same time that I came to a complete stop a safe distance away, the red mustang locked up it's wheels in a nosedive, smoke everywhere, skidded onto the shoulder, and scraped the fuck out of it's side.

I assume the driver was texting. Fucking idiot.

My most memorable experience on this stretch of freeway was during October of last year, when I was on my motorcycle and swerved just in time to avoid a large object (that looked like a gallon jug of milk) fly by me at windshield/head level. I looked in my side view mirror just in time as it hit, and exploded all over the windshield of the car behind me. Sure enough, it was a jug of milk, and at 65 mph, it would have killed me.

tilde_tilde_tilde,civ,1388899051.0,"I assume you know how to gain happiness, with the buildings in each city and luxuries, etc.  I assume you know how to gain culture, with the buildings, wonders, landmarks, and working the guilds.  I assume you know how to gain tourism, with creating Great Works.  Tourism also has a few multiplying modifiers (trade routes, embassy, open borders, etc.).

Now, there are various levels of influence one civ can exert on another.  This is the Tourism(influencing)/Culture(influenced).  So if Japan has 5 tourism on Rome (who has a total of 20 culture), Japan would have a 25% influence over Rome. The tiers for tourism influence are at the percentages of 10, 30, 50, and 200. Each level will increase the science from trade routes, decrease spy surveillance time, and decrease unrest from conquering their cities.

What does this mean for us?  Obviously, it can be seen that culture is a shield against tourism; however, ideological influence is cumulative.  That is, every Order civ, even if they have little influence individually, together can create a large ideological influence.

Go to the culture victory page, when you mouse over the ideology the civ owns it will tell you what they are influenced into and by. each tier you you are above their influence on you: Exotic, Familiar, Popular, Influential, Dominant. Provides another ""influenced towards so and so ideology"" point, 2 points = dissidents, 4 points = civil resistance, 8 points = revolutionary wave.  Each of these levels has a certain number of ""unhappiness per city OR unhappiness per culture.""  I don't recall how much off the top of my head.

I didn't even know what that was until last summer when I asked a cousin's friend if she was married, then she explained it's just a promise ring.

From my understanding it is meant to signify your loyalty to your SO and a promise along with it (I will stay faithful, one day we will marry, I will do my best to keep you happy, etc.).

I honestly think promise rings are the most irrational and useless rings in existence. If you are old enough to get married, why not just wait until the appropriate time in the relationship to propose?

But because you're both still students and have some things to still figure out even though you're ready for marriage, I guess it is cool of him to do that since it has some meaning to you.

The OP wasn't asking what society thinks of men owning sex toys. He was asking if it's common for men to own them--and yeah, it's becoming increasingly common, especially with the introduction of the Tenga line of toys, which look nothing like vaginas.

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1388899505.0,"&gt;the idea means the buddha is in all places equally as we are all in union with one another. 

What does this have to do with respecting sacred images of the Buddha as a way to respect this principle (the Dharmakaya)?


&gt;one could even say that the buddha was the ultimate iconoclast. 

Towards the Hindu caste system. Not much else, besides our ignorance, of course.

&gt;buddha showed us that all icons are illusion, thus setting the path to their destruction.

&gt;edit: it is not a literally killing of the buddha. it is a killing of the concept of the buddha you hold in your mind, because any concept you hold holds you. one should keep ones mind like a clean slate.

I know what it means. *Not all schools teach the way Zen does* so I don't know why you are insisting that people shouldn't find it disrespectful based on the teaching methods of a school they may not even be a part of.

tangerinelion,beer,1388899514.0,"BTW, your math is bonked.  You can't divide Fahrenheit like that.

Imagine you started with 32F water, or melted ice.  Then suppose you converted to Celsius and did the same math.

Immediately you notice that your ""18% increase"" becomes 44.9F = 7.2C and your 32F = 0C, so the increase is now 7.2C / 0C = infinite.  Terrible job, tulip.

The correct thing to do is convert to either Kelvin or Rankine.

The latter is easiest if you measured in F, as the relation is T(R) = 459.67 + T(F).  So you actually have water that started at 497.67R, the tulip ended at 504.57R, and the mug ended at 510.37R.  These are increases of 1.3% and 2.5%, not 18% and 33%.

All we can really say is that the Tulip saw an increase in temperature equal to 54% that of the mug, or 46% less than the mug.  Inverting it what we find is that the mug absorbs about 85% more heat than the tulip, but this does not mean the tulip is 88% better (firstly because ""better"" isn't defined)."

Do you think NK hasn't reinvaded the south because they've forgiven them? How about Japan? Come on now... isn't it because they've strangled themselves into poverty.

And that's subjective. I think the Orwell state NK has constructed is at least equally bad as the US's crimes.

Getting kicked out is awful. It's coming up on three years ago for me, and my relationship with my parents is still pretty distant and strained. But after the initial thermonuclear blast, things quieted down a lot. I found a place pretty quickly, but the lease didn't start for a few more months, so I was tolerated on my parents' property for a bit longer. By the time I physically moved out, things weren't nearly as bad as they'd been.

Your blowup only just happened, so hopefully the situation will change over the coming weeks and months. Definitely talk to your financial aid office in the meantime. Who knows?-- a financial aid officer might be willing to call or send your mother a letter on official letterhead personally requesting that she complete the FAFSA.

Jeffreyrock,philosophy,1388899638.0,"&gt; it doesn't seem at all supported by our current understanding of the universe.

Sure it does.  Incidentally the fundamental theories that make up our current understanding of the universe originated during the era Jeans was writing in.  

Another quote I like is one from Heisenberg:  ""I think that modern physics has definitely decided in favor of Plato. In fact the smallest units of matter are not physical objects in the ordinary sense; they are forms, ideas which can be expressed unambiguously only in mathematical language.""  In other words, the deeper you penetrate into nature of matter the more you converge on pure mathematics, which is itself a structure of pure thought.  

Lastly, from Max Planck:  ""As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear-headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research into atoms this much. There is no matter, as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of the atom to vibration. I must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter.""

&gt;The structure of the universe is utterly indifferent to our existence.

How can we say for sure?  Western science has long been wedded to rank materialism and has never seriously framed an investigation into consciousness as anything other than a product of matter-- we as yet have no real inkling of its true nature."

I'm probably going to get slammed here, but I'm going to be honest with you, after 8 years I finally got an MCR tattoo. The break up kinda sealed the deal for me, knowing that no matter what happens their discography will always mean something to me. I'm glad I waited so long because I switched from generic ideas that directly relate to the band/album cover/artwork to an image I'm in love with that's taken 8 years of my life to create. (I wish you could see the hundreds of ideas I've saved.)

Basically what I'm trying to say to OP is at 18, your tastes will evolve. Some will stay with you forever and some will fade. I'm sure you're aware when you choose a FOB tattoo it's forever. You'll be 55...75 with it one day. Take the time to create something that means Fall Out Boy to *you* and not just something off the album covers. Honestly, since the end of the hiatus I'm so glad I haven't gotten a FOB tattoo yet, seeing as I have many, many other tattoos. The band is also changing and evolving and so are my tattoo ideas. It's worth waiting awhile to find something you're not just ""into"" and ""settling"" on but something you're passionate about. This is just my little piece of advice from someone who got a tattoo at 18 that cooooooould've been better. ;) Good luck!"

If your friends are more like acquintances you drink with and pretend to be friends, it's because you're not giving them enough reason to want to hang with otherwise. Maybe you don't ask about them enough...maybe you don't invite them out enough to do other things? 

Your girlfriend cheating on you isn't really a big deal. I mean, it sucks, and maybe you did a poor job of being a sex-worthy male for her and she found it some place else, but there are many fish in the sea. Male sexuality is binary; if you can attract one girl, you can attract many many girls. 

Just remember, the game doesn't stop because you're in an LTR; if you don't remain the person she was attracted to, to begin with, or better, yea, she's gonna dump or cheat on you. "

The lady states that there was a red car that clipped her, causing her to lose control and hit the snowbank. Since there is suddenly another car, it's being investigated under the whole hit and run/uninsured motorist approach. 

I was in the military and ""hey, I don't have a car to get to work"" doesn't cut it, so I had to get a rental car. USAA tells me they realize this is a huge burden, but they won't pay for it while they are figuring out if there was another car. If there wasn't, they'd reimburse me for it, if there wasn't, I'm shit out of luck. 

Turns out the lady who was handling my side of the case decided to go on vacation about 2 days after I filed, and nobody bothered to tell me. 2 weeks later, it took me getting REALLY nasty (no I'm not going to fucking wait for her to come back, put me through to someone else, NOW) and working with the other person's insurance agent to get anything done.

There are a ton of JRPGs that go unnoticed.

Shulk from Xenoblade Chronicles. I'm mid-game, and he currently has an extremely powerful sword, extremely effective precog, and is just an all-around bad ass. Also, Xenoblade Chronicles is a pretty good universe, but has some issues. For example, normal weapons don't work on the Mechon, which would make fights with adamantanium users hard to gauge.

A quick search for ""xillia"" and ""Maxwell"" and ""Milla"" show that the Tales of Xillia universe is fairly unexplored. It's pretty easy to see how powerful the characters are through normal combat.

Valkyrie Profile has an interesting take on Norse mythology, and the characters are very powerful without being overpowered. If you ever need to know how powerful they need to be you can just check their Soul Crush.

I'd imagine that the universes linked need to be accessible enough for someone could easily understand how powerful those characters are, so perhaps this was a bad post.

Ekotar,malefashionadvice,1388900079.0,"Well, what feels wrong about it? Have you looked for inspiration? Have you figured out what you like?

I know it sucks fashion is so subjective, but I really think you gotta put in the work to figure out what you like, experiment with fits, and see not just how it looks when you wake up, but when you get home. 

I know it's weird, as someone who clearly wants to look good(I mean, you came here trying to improve) to put out a fit that feels 70% or 85% right but there's something just *off*. But sometimes you'll figure it out right away: *""Oh, it's look better w/ X shoes or Y Jacket instead!""* and sometimes it'll take a day or two. I always kick myself on those 85% days at around 2 because it'll just *CLICK* in my head. 

The secret? Don't make the same mistake twice.

Plan your purchases so each one creates a two or three new outfit combinations with old pieces, but also so it improves old standby fits you like (or *fills the gaps* so to speak)

Ya dig? I can upload a few different things from what I have if you like. My personal grey chinos are lighter grey (from JCrew) and I love them with my Pink OCBD, navy v-neck, and a burgundy tee. I'm still figuring out my next big shoe purchase, but it'll be Beckman's in Cigar or Black Cherry, and my grey chinos (and denim, brown chinos, olive, navy, and khaki, etc) will go great will it, I'm sure.

Gluestick05,weddingplanning,1388900131.0,"&gt; I relay these ideas to my parents and they pretty much make a sour face about it since they think ""not everyone will enjoy that"" (but really they mean themselves). Every. single. idea.

So, this is kind of how I feel like my parents have been.  Very supportive, but pretty cold on most of our ideas.  We're doing a weekend retreat with hiking, cooking classes, and some unstructured reunion time, and we hear a lot of ""people aren't going to like that,"" as if walking around and eating food is somehow polarizing.  Is it your parents' style to ""poke holes"" in things?

Ultimately, we're just charging forward.  You can't please everyone, you just need to do your best to plan an enjoyable party and then show up and have fun.  People will have fun if you have fun.  Nobody will care about how they signed the guest book.  If it's any comfort, my parents have gotten progressively more excited as we have finalized decisions.

&gt; I guess my point is that they simply can't support any excitement I do have for planning a wedding, and it's been like this for months.

Many people just aren't into weddings.  I know it's supposed to be a magical time with your mom and stuff, but really weddings are a big pain in the ass to plan, and not everyone is going to love it.

**My advice** would be to push forward with your ideas, and instead of just asking for opinions, offer your parents a ""veto.""  It is much, much harder to ""veto"" a fully-formed proposal than it is to poke holes in ideas.  The veto lets them maintain some control, but discourages nit-picking and other less constructive complaining."

Hey, you know vampires?  Those things that don't exist?  What do exist are men and women.  We're all washed with the same sex hormones (E and T) in different amounts.  Is it really all that difficult to understand that some people fall outside of the realm of what makes one specifically a man or a woman?

Whereas, there's no ""vampire"" gene.  There's no cross-species DNA swimming around in our bodies, for those who like to talk about dolphins or dinosaurs, or what-have-you.

askgeeves,gallifrey,1388900347.0,"I can't agree enough about the rewatchability point.
Whist I enjoyed most episodes on first watch I've found Matt Smith's the least rewatchable (as in going back about a year after it airs).  I can watch pretty much all of the other Doctors episodes over and over but only several of Matt Smith's are bearable on 2nd viewing for me. (There are a few that are very very good in my opinion though). 

For me I'd say this is less to do with the arcs and more to do with not liking the silliness and acting style as much (as well as many episodes with weaker writing). It just makes me cringe a lot to be honest. I definitely prefer the more serious and grumpy Doctors and agree that I felt a lack of depth and many of Matt Smith's more emotional moments fell flat for me.

I respect that the show has grown heaps in his tenure and he's not been bad as such but I'm definitely in the minority that would rate Matt Smith as one of my least favourite Doctors."

Sure.

You've just serenely glossed over the whole crux of the matter.  The human brain is arguably the most complex piece of machinery (or hard ware) ever to come into being in the universe.  Now, certainly we would balk if someone said ""the matter in my Honda arranged itself into a car""-- because building a car is something that requires planning and carefully coordinated steps, something that can only happen through the instrumentation of a mind.  

&gt;Why would a non-matter dependent mind give rise to matter-dependent minds?

That's a very interesting and deep question and I don't have the answer right now...and I don't see how my not having an answer now in any way impacts my earlier thesis of the logical priority of mind over matter.

jhalton3,magicTCG,1388900522.0,"I am a competitive player.

I didn't start as a competitive player, but rather became one as I started to be around more competitive players.

I have been on both sides of this.  How I have enjoyed magic has changed.  Back at the kitchen table I used to play at, I almost always had the best deck.  I ran counter spells first and did all kinds of things that my play group hated.  I was the first to die in our multiplayer games and I deserved it.  Soon, my friends started buying singles (oh my...) to beat me, and it worked.  I started losing.  I responded in kind and built my own decks to beat theirs.

At this point, I started to enjoy this.  This was my birth as a competitive player.  I still hated netdecks (where's the fun in someone else's deck?) but I was buying singles now and my budget was on the rise.  I started winning again, and soon we ran into a problem with a known solution...  I was playing banned cards, but we weren't playing inside of a format, so we started.  We went with standard, since it seemed cheap (we were young and stupid).

Now that I had a standard deck, I could play at the MTG club at my school.  I played against T1 decks and lost... a lot.  They let me start borrowing their decks and I really enjoyed it.  Who cares if someone else plays this?  Tempered Steel was awesome, you know?  So I started netdecking.

The only format where I still hated the players playing the best cards was EDH, and with time, even this faded.  Do I want to be that guy?  No.  In fact, I played a pillow fort deck with no win conditions for close to a year.

Now I am a competitive player.  I play standard on a budget (bog ass witch ftw), Twin in Modern and Sneak and Breach in Legacy.  I play EDH, but not very well.

Recently, my roommates started playing the game.  By the time they did, I was already a serious competitive player.  I would sit down with my decks and clean up.  Not even take damage.  It was bad.  They stated to not want to play with me.  You know what I did?  I built a casual deck.

My casual deck runs: 22 lands, 38 creatures.  It can win some and it can lose some.  Even when it wins in a landslide, my opponent doesn't feel like it's OP, you know why?  Because I play a tribal deck that isn't explosive.  Removal hurts me, but doesn't stop me and counterspells hurt.

Overall, this is what I have learned.  If you enjoy casual, that's great.  If prefer competitive, that's great too.  Everyone has their thing.  Respect other people's things.  If you are a competitive player and want to play with casual players, (for lack of better words) try to sink to their level.  Build something casual to play with them.

**TLDR;** Yeah, we do that.  It sucks.  We need to do better.  Competitive players should try to accommodate the casual players if possible, or at least warn them in advance."

When I hurt super bad, I get cranky and mean. When I'm feeling like a jerk, I will put myself in time-out for a bit so I'm alone and can't hurt anyone. Also, I make myself wait several seconds to reply to something someone says, that way I don't blurt out anything hurtful. 

I highly recommend a psychiatrist. Mine was (I'm without insurance for a bit.) awesome. Also, be vigilant about ways to control your pain or to work out aggression. I (lightly) exercise when I'm upset. But do whatever helps your pain, if your pain is lessened, you'll be less mad. Heating pads, Biofreeze, sweet treats, movies, cuddles, those are my go-tos when I need to deal with the pain. 

I recommend doing all the above, taking a few days to get yourself straight, then go to her. Tell her your pain makes you this way, and that you're sorry, and tell her that you're working on ways to control your pain and anger. 

Also, find hobbies that you can do with your new limitations but that still make you happy. Your can't let your disease change you, but you can change parts of your life to fit the new you. "

You're question made me curious as well. I couldn't find any info on the company or what they're doing nowadays. So I looked up the website registry information. Here is what I found out. 

* Registrant Name: Yair Greenberg
* Registrant Street: 21306 Gault
* Registrant City: Canoga Park
* Registrant State/Province: California
* Registrant Postal Code: 91303
* Registrant Country: United States
* Registrant Phone: +1.8187048888

The company at least was registered to someone in California via GoDaddy registration. Now this doesn't mean the company is based in California per se. But most of the time when a site is registered to a place it's most often a HQ or the location where someone has something to do with the company. 

However, [Google street viewing that address leads us to a building called ""Yafa""](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=21306+Gault+Canoga+Park,+California&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=_-7IUsWCNaTCywGIwIHoAg&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAg)

[Yafa company as it turns out is](http://www.yafa.com/) *Yafa® (established 1978) is the manufacturer and worldwide distributor for 3 brands, Monteverde®, Yafa®, and Aldo Domani® which are now available in 25 countries.* 

So with all of that said Yafa is registered to the same company and location and runs quite a few major brands websites. So it appears they are a distributor who also has pens manufactured for the brands they own. Now IIRC MonteVerde is made in the USA. So I would assume that same factory more than likely churns out Conklins as well. Now the question arises of where are the Monteverdes made. We need to find that factory and if they produce the Conklins there. If not I'm going to assume that they are made in a factory in either China or India like most other fountain pens, and if they are that makes me sort of sad. I want an Ohio pen.

Note that there's a difference between using a group identity as a shortcut and using it as a replacement for independent thinking.

Cryptonix,Christianity,1388900726.0,"&gt; I personally, and a lot of us as Christians, put a lot of stock in the resurrection. If it happened, it doesn't prove that Jesus was who He said He was, but it does make it a lot more plausible.

A majority of humanity for most of recent history believes in Christianity because they were forced to and knew nothing else. They were threatened with damnation, both in the afterlife and in real life. That's why there's a bunch of Christians. It was forced and now it's just everywhere. That's also why there's a lot of stock put into it. It's been here a while and in mass numbers because people would have been shamed to death otherwise. That doesn't make it more plausible. If our ancestors forced humanity to believe in Islam (like they actually do in the Middle East), there would be a mass number of Muslims and stock put into Islam.

&gt; As for why not other religions, it really comes down not to right or wrong, but truth and more truth. I believe Christianity contains the most truth, so I'm here. Lots of religions get lots of things right, but I think Christianity gets the most things right with regards to theology.

If not right or wrong, give me a truth. What's a truth from your religion you can give me that I can't deny?

If we want to talk right and wrong, let's talk about Original Sin and how currently 7,000,000,000 people are held responsible and punished by default for the defiant acts of 2 people. Those two people stand for all of us and that's why people are suffering today.  Adam and Eve are 0.0000003% of humanity, which is demonstrably small, but us 99.9999997% are guilty with them.

I do. For a long time, it actually depressed me that the rest of the world doesn't see/hear/taste/feel things the way synesthetes do (in their own individual forms).

Once I do that a few times and am comfortable, I just incorporate the Ollie, the same way I ollie over a simple crack or sidewalk line, using the line between the sidewalk and curb the same way I do when going on flat.

It also helps if you add a little speed.

And once you land it, even if it's just a pop off the curb and not a full ollie, you just go at it again and again, until it feels natural.

There is something in him that is causing this depression. The best way I can describe depression is a long dark tunnel. You know there is a light down at the end. But it is so far away and you are already tired of traveling, so what's the point of going to the end. Then it perpetuates. You just get more depressed, until one day you either start feeling like life is getting better, or you take anti-depressants (those don't even fully work).

My wife and I have been together for over 20 years, and the passion is very much still there. We routinely embarrass our kids, and that's just from things like cuddling on the couch or kissing goodbye/hello. 

I shudder to think of the emotional scars that would result if we didn't lock our bedroom door.....


It takes a bit of work at times, though. A big enemy is complacency; Once you get comfortable, you tend to stop working at it. You get lazy, you slack off because you know you don't really need to work. You feel safe, like the relationship is secure and you don't have to put that effort into it anymore...and that's the start of a slow rot. 

Another enemy is time, and I don't mean the passage of time. I mean how you spend your time. There will be periods where one or both of you is busy....and because of that complacency, you feel safe knocking down the priority a bit. 

It's not the sign of a doomed relationship, and it's not inevitable...but it is a natural phase that relationships go through. You just have to make the relationship a priority. 

And just to be clear.... the ""you"" in all of that is the plural ""you"". Go back and read it again with that in mind.

&gt;I love her a lot still and am not looking to break up with her, but would just like to know if this is just normal and something you just have to get used to and adjust to it?

No. No, you do not. You can if you want to....but I wouldn't recommend it.

I can't link you to any studies on it, but I can't imagine that having the TV on constantly is any good - however, I don't think I'd approach it from that angle if you really feel the need to say something to your sister.

I'm guessing here, but your sister probably keeps the TV on at night as sort of a white-noise thing.  I would just buy a white noise machine as a new-baby gift and tell her you've heard parents rave about these and thought maybe she would like to try it out to help her baby sleep.

As far as having the TV on while the baby's awake.. well, my baby didn't pay any attention to the TV until he was about 8 months old.  Now he's 10 months and if I have the TV on he'll watch for a little bit, then go back to playing with his toys.  As long as he has plenty of appropriate stimulus I don't think he'll pay that much attention to the TV, but I could be wrong.

That is done outside a dog park under controlled conditions with leashed animals.

Dog people don't get freaked out by pit bulls. Dog people know that each dog is different, and that no matter what reputation of breed may have, any given individual dog may be completely different from the reputations of breed has. The problem with pit bulls, is the stereotypical behavior of pit bull owners, (some of,).

***Questions***

1. Central Standard Timezone, Canada. 

2. It depends on how long I spend on reddit that day, usually around half my time is spent in sports subreddits, reading threads and stories along with commenting and occasionally posting. It can be half an hour a day up to 2 or 3 hours. 

3. I haven't been a member of the /r/sports community for very long, I've lurked previously but only subscriber 4 or 5 days ago. But I've been a part of a lot of other reddit sports communities since I started redditing. I'm an experienced mod and huge sports fan, and some of the ideas that I have for this subreddit in my opinion could improve it. 

Here's some ideas I have that are not necessarily changes, some may be additions as well: 

* I'm not sure if you're at the flair limit yet but adding more would be a good idea. 

* Having something similar to /r/nfl with distinguished comments, there when a mod distinguished his comment their team logo is replaced with the NFL's logo. It could be a good idea for this subreddit as well so it doesn't appear that there is a bias when doing mod actions, especially if it coincidentally happens to be something pertaining to a user who supports a different team, such as a comment removal. Having a default flair that comes up when distinguishing a comment would be a good idea. 

* Since you've just became a default and will probably have an increase in things such as image posts. A daily image post thread automated by automoderator could cut down on the ""fluff"" content. If this is an interest to you.

* A daily highlight's post, gifs and videos of recent sports highlights could be posted in there.

* A daily questionnaire post, since you're now a default there will definitely be an increase in people unfamiliar with sports,  instead of everyone who has a question making a thread that can all be put in one thread. Or this could be a weekly questions post. 

* Though I'd admit I haven't seen a lot of posts about personal stuff, such as ""I bought this jersey"" and an imgur link to the jersey, moving those style of posts to a different subreddit could be beneficial. I grabbed the subreddit /r/sportsfandom as a possibility. 

* Link Flairs, ""Football"", ""Golf"", ""Meta"" etc. 

* An IRC channel for general sports discussion.

Kerithlan,pokemontrades,1388901720.0,"I think that the biggest problem (and the one that bothers me the most as a new user) is that the only way to climb the ladder is by trading progressively harder-to-find Pokemon. It creates a false illusion of the pillar of trust -- what I feel the hierarchy is for/touted as.

What it instead creates is a ""have's club"" or in other words a small pool of players who pour hours of their lives into creating the most token of collections.

While on paper that sounds nice, it isn't realistic and doesn't encompass what I've observed the majority of traders here to be about.

The majority of people here seem to be on the more ""hardcore"" side of things, yes, but as competitive battlers rather than artificial economy juggernauts.

Should the point of the hierarchy, therefore, not reflect a modicum of trust/credibility as is basically established by the [Flair FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/flair): ""CSS flair denotes that the user have been actively trading on /r/pokemontrades and can be trusted to a certain extend."" [sic]

Why not simply increase the number of trades required for higher tier flair balls and remove the artificial restrictions, or better yet, develop a point-based system?

Earning a certain number of points surely is a better solution than completing a certain amount of trades, as it allows each subredditor the opportunity to play as they'd like, rather than forcing those that don't care about events or shinies to ""play the game"" so to speak.

Let's examine the point idea a bit more. Rather than having each trade itself constitute one point based on its content, and each flair tier requiring a certain point value based on trade content...

... why not have each flair tier require a certain amount of points, and each trade be worth a different value of points based off of its contents?

That way, we'd approach a system that more correctly denotes a tenured, trustworthy trader rather than the current system that more or less says, ""this person is really good at finding rare stuff.""

Let's say that the tier hierarchy requirements change to be as follows:

1. Pokeball: 32 points
2. Premier Ball: 80 points
3. Great Ball: 200 points
4. Ultra Ball: 500 points
5. Master Ball: 1,250 points

This system separates each tier by 2.5 times the previous tier's minimum.

Now let's say that any generic, common Pokemon (such as a 5IV HA Charmander for a 5IV HA Blastoise) is worth 1 point, as are common items (BP items, for example), and that each progressively higher tier trade involves progressively higher points.

For example, let's say trading a Shiny Pokemon is worth 3 points, and worth another 7 points if it is competitive. I'm bullshitting numbers out of my ass, but wanted to give a very simple example. We'd need someone (or the subreddit) to sit down and formulate a fair point scale, but once that was figured out the only challenge would be looking over references.

As a quick example with [my reference sheet](http://www.reddit.com/r/poketradereferences/comments/1spdv0/kerithlans_reference/), I'm currently eligible to apply for a Pokeball flair if I felt like it. In a system where everything that I've traded is worth 1 point (it's all low tier stuff), my current sheet has a potential of 28 points with 9 trades. Extrapolating on that, this means that people will need to amass around 10-20 trades before being able to apply for a Pokeball, which while much larger than at present would better represent the fact that I am able to reliably participate in a variety of trades with a variety of people.

The biggest flaw with the current flair system is that it doesn't actually do very much for the people that you trade with, and is only there to look fancy for your own benefit/ego. Reinventing the flair system to help others rather than oneself is a great way to promote better trading overall.

The secondary fault is that it only caters to one portion of the user base here rather than to each individual type of trader. This system changes that by granting bigger point rewards and faster ladder growth to those trading harder to obtain items, while still ensuring that everyone will have access to a Master Ball flair if so desired. If someone wants to earn trust and repute by trading nothing but tier 1 rarity Pokemon, they can do that without worry."

* Onion 
* Bell pepper 
* Broccoli 
* Carrot 
* cabbage 

Toss it in a pan with some olive oil to soften the crunchy stuff and wilt the cabbage, season with a bit of salt and pepper. Cook some rice and add in lentils (I like a 1:1 ratio). Do up some chicken in a pan with a little olive oil. Filets, strips, dices, however you wanna eat it.

Bam. World is your oyster. Want a mexican flavor to it? Add some salsa, chicken broth, cumin, and cilantro to the rice/lentils while it's cooking. Top with salsa, greek yogurt, and I like to add in some black beans. Asian? Stir fry it up with some teriyaki sauce or whatever you like best! Something hearty?

duckface08,nursing,1388902059.0,"I don't work in an under served area but I definitely moved further north to a smaller town, though I don't qualify for tuition reimbursement. I originally came from a big city. It was definitely a big change from what I was used to while in nursing school.

I also know several of my classmates who also ended up in small towns and northern areas. Two of them even ended up in a tiny Native reserve on James Bay. Reactions to the culture/geography change and the distance from family and friends differ depending on your goals, personality, and how you adjust.

I know some people who nope'd out of it and moved back home after 6-12 months, while I know one girl who has met a great guy and plans to settle here permanently. Some people are city-dwellers at heart and love the bright lights and constant bustle, while others prefer the great outdoors and a quieter lifestyle.

Typically, at least in Ontario, the smaller and more isolated you are, the higher variety you'll see of patients. The two classmates who went all the way to James Bay had to train in just about every major specialty - medical, geriatrics, pediatrics, maternity, emergency, psychiatry - and because of the lack of doctors, they acted pretty autonomously. The learning curve, however, is incredibly steep.

Where I live, we have a lot more resources but even still, I get a wider variety of patients on my unit than a similar one in a big city. I find big cities with their numerous hospitals and higher concentrations of specialties and research programs end up with smaller, more specialized units (I.e. Cardiology, respiratory, hematology, surgical oncology, orthopaedics, GI surgical, etc). Smaller hospitals will lump them more together (I.e. One unit for all kinds of surgical cases instead of separating them, all types of oncology patients getting different types of treatments). The trade-off seems to be that highly complex/rare cases will be sent off to the big city hospitals."

m00nf1r3,AskWomen,1388902276.0,"My top comment was in response to [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1jptng/ladies_what_was_the_gamechanging_difference_that/) in /r/sex about what the ""game-changing"" difference that separated a regular sex partner from the best I ever had.  I got 338 karma for saying this:  

&gt;I'm currently dating the best sex partner I've ever had. We (31F, 26M) met online, he replied to my ad looking for a FWB (Craigslist) and we ended up falling completely in love in a very short time. Here is what makes him the best compared to the other 35-ish guys I've been with.

1. He's emotionally honest and open about everything (it might sound odd, but that makes a difference).

2. He is the first guy to make me cum from penetration, and it happens Every. Single. Time. I'm not sure if it's his upward curve or just general knowledge about how to penetrate a woman, but we both agree that our sex organs were designed for one another. He says my pussy feels the best from previous partners, and his cock drives me wild.

3. He's the best kisser ever. He has these thick, soft lips that mesh perfectly with my own and he knows how to use his tongue during a kiss. His kisses turn me on immensely. 

4. He's the perfect nipple pleaser. I've had some amazing nipple play in the past but nothing like what I'm getting from my current guy. He's so gentle with it that it feels both amazing and like a constant tease. Makes me so wet!

5. He does things for me that no other guy would ever do. We do have vaginal sex while I'm menstruating, but I don't ever ask him to finger me because that's gross. If I want a clitoral orgasm during that time of the month, I use a toy and wash it. Well, my vibrator broke a week or so ago and along comes my period. I was texting him while he worked one night about my sexual frustration and almost as soon as he walked in the door, he led me into the bedroom, kissed me passionately, played with my nipples until I could hardly take it anymore, then slid a hand down my panties and teased my clit until I came. I was dizzy afterwards, it felt so good. Then he fucked my brains out. ;)

So now to get a computer that can compete or exceed consoles you would need to spend another $300-400 more if you are thrifty.

And like you mentioned, not having to pay for subscriptions to a service other than maybe an MMO and discounted games will help a lot.

I went to hang out with my best friend and she invited me over to a buddies house. I'd had about two drinks at this point and was a career drinker. Bartender, what can I say. 

Anyway, the guy makes me a drink and all of a sudden I'm fading. Can't hardly stand. He offers to take me up and put me in the spare bedroom. From this point on, everything went black. 

I came to, with him on top of me and his tongue down my throat. He pulled away to whisper ""Shh,  This is our little secret."" In my fight for consciousness, all I can make out are his lips. I fight to speak and fail. I can't move. I black out again. 

I wake up the next morning feeling sicker than I'd ever been. My clothing is askew and my other friend Ashley is sleeping next to me. My body is sluggish and sore. I see bruises on my breasts. Finger bruises. Thighs too. But didn't feel that tell tale sensation like a penis had been inside me. I grizzly remember that one moment I was conscious, and ask Ashley about what happened. 

Apparently he had disappeared up stairs with me and she came up to check on me, only to find the door locked. She thought it was weird but didn't speak up because she didn't jump to that conclusion. Fifteen minutes later she came up to check on me again to see him coming out of the room he'd put me in, and he grinned and said she was ""too late"". 

I told my best friend about it and she refused to believe me. Shamed me. I struggled to deal with it alone. 

About a month later and I'm out with friends, and this guy comes up to and puts his arms around me. ""Hey baby.""

Me: ""uh, who are you?""

He leaned in close and whispered, ""don't you remember me baby? We had so much fun together.""

Everything clicks and I froze. Just, terrified, shaking, and I said, ""no, because I was unconscious.""

He laughed at me and walked away. 

I didn't deal with it well. I'd been abused as a child and it brought back many unhappy feelings. I got stuck in a negative thought loop and agonized over it. I felt I couldn't get past it because I didn't know what all he did to me, but he was in the room with me for twenty five minutes or something. It still hurts me to this day that I didn't knock his teeth out, I just stood there and shook like a mouse. "

Geohump,AdviceAnimals,1388902493.0,"The real problem here is the owners of the pit bulls. The irresponsible ones that is. In the United Kingdom, where these dogs originated, they have decided not to allow them to reproduce anymore. All pit bulls or pit bull hybrids have been banned.  They can be seized by the police without a warrant.

From: https://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public/banned-dogs
 
Going to court

It’s your responsibility to prove your dog is not a banned type.

If you prove this, the court will order the dog to be returned to you. If you can’t prove it (or you plead guilty), you’ll be convicted of a crime.

The maximum penalty for having a banned dog against the law is a £5,000 fine and/or 6 months in prison. Your dog will also be destroyed.
Index of Exempted Dogs (IED)

If your dog is banned but the court thinks it’s not a danger to the public, it may put it on the IED and let you keep it.

You’ll be given a Certificate of Exemption. This is valid for the life of the dog.

Your dog must be:

    neutered
    tattooed
    microchipped
    kept on a lead and muzzled at all times when in public
    kept in a secure place so it can’t escape

As the owner, you must:

    take out insurance against your dog injuring other people
    be aged over 16
    show the Certificate of Exemption when asked by a police officer or council dog warden, either at the time or within 5 days
    let the IED know if you change address, or your dog dies

Edit: If you just mean French in general then a great place to start is with basic literature. Something I found useful was to read a book in French of which you know the basic plot.

Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems the reason they might generally get away with this is because of EULA stuff. Games are no longer really viewed (at least by major producers) as physical media that can have defects and fall under the relevant laws, but rather services that can be revoked at any time and that do not make any guarantees of quality or longevity. That seems to be how they are covering their asses, but if it holds up in court if it comes to it is a different story."

Cryptonix,Christianity,1388902755.0,"&gt; Something tells me you've got your ears plugged here, so I'm not going to try and convince you otherwise, but you should know that you are pre-emptively dismissing all evidence for Christianity, and the assumptions about it that you have to fill in to explain yourself (how did it get so big to begin with, how many people converted from other religions or schools of thought with no thought of eternal punisment, etc) are, from my end, just as preposterous as the ones you aren't examining sound in your head. So like I said, I'll leave that one there.

I was saying how the equity of Christianity comes from the fact that there are a lot of Christians. Oppression did come from the Christian people and the number is so big because of the distribution. Christians became people in power, so they could make their way around the world and that's how it got so large. Not everyone was convinced through fear of damnation, of course, so I'm sorry for saying that. Still, Christians raised their children and those children would raise their children as Christians, etc etc. It's all they knew and while considering another religion never came to their mind anyways, doing so would put that fear on them. People can go from one belief to the other nowadays because of freedom and intelligence. That didn't exist back then and some people today don't even get that. Some people are denied that by their parents. You most likely have the freedom to not be Christian, but Christians back then could not without punishment. You could kill me, an Atheist, if we lived in olden times. You as a Christian had that power in many governments. I probably wouldn't be Atheist, though, because I wouldn't know the things I do now AND I'd be shamed even if I did.

Still, people are Christians because it's what they're convinced by, but suddenly replace the situation with Islam or Judaism and bam, you're Muslim or Jewish. Funny how that works.

&gt; People can't deny truth? News to me. You can deny anything you want.

Oh yeah, people deny facts all the time...but still, go ahead and give me a truth from Christianity. I'll see how I feel about it.

&gt; This is a misunderstanding of original sin. Original guilt is what you're describing here, and is explicitly rejected by God on multiple occasions in the Bible. So, knowing that, you can set that fight down.

Or, you know, you could explain my misunderstanding. I'd appreciate it."

It's completely rational to want to spend time with your S.O (Even though /u/twwwy did a good job in explaining how her reaction could be considered selfish). But I think you may be misunderstanding what I mean when I say introverted people get worn out by spending a lot of time with romantic interests. Of course I want to spend time with them, but ""as long as you can"" can sometimes be a pretty long time, especially if you're supposed to dedicate every waking moment of that time to spending time with your partner. Spending one entire day isn't painful, but an entire week is. As I said, this is very different from living together, because although you are technically spending time together constantly every day, you're not necessarily interacting all the time, you can do your own stuff. I'm sure even extroverted people would get sick of having to entertain each other for days at a time, they have hobbies too.

Now in this case, it isn't about them having spent lots of time together and that she wants more, it's that she had some off time and was upset that he didn't want to disrupt his plan to have some alone time to be with her, and that is understandable. But you also have to notice that he apparently had planned things with his friends and had been doing stuff all week, not to mention working a 9-5 job. I definitely understand his need to take some time to himself to do what he needs to do to be able to get through the week.

Srace,AlAnon,1388902994.0,"I haven't had a lot of success with controlling the alcoholics in my life (or the regular people, for that matter) or getting them to behave in the way that would probably be best for them and definitely be best for me.  Because of this, when I am thinking ""if only such and such would be different,"" sometimes I like to reframe the dilemma.  Instead of thinking ""what could they do to make my plan for how I want things to unfold work better, and how can I make them take those actions?"", I think ""what would I be doing in this situation if they weren't here?"".  Often, brainstorming about this gives me some great ideas to solve my problem, and then I can let them off the hook because I'm not depending on them to be there for me when they aren't capable of carrying that responsibility.  I feel better when I'm not waiting around for someone to sober up or smarten up.

I don't think it's unreasonable for you not to want your kids near your dad when he's drinking, but given that he has a drinking problem, it's probably unrealistic to think he'll be able to put them first and restrain himself.  The first priority of the alcoholics I know is alcohol, not their families.  Maybe you can set some boundaries that you are comfortable with and that you can control?  For example, if you leave the kids over there, you have no control over whether they are exposed to the drinking or not.  If you find an alternative for babysitting, and only go over for visits when you can stay too, then you can choose to leave whenever the drinking reaches a level that makes you uncomfortable.

I haven't had a lot of success in setting boundaries that depend on other people to act a certain way, but I have had good success with setting boundaries where I set a certain course of action for myself.

use_more_lube,changemyview,1388903129.0,"I don't think alcohol is recognized as a healthy life choice, nor are cigarettes - yet both are used, legally, but adults in this country. 

Just because it's bad (or may be bad) for children and teens does not mean we should ban the use for adults. Just because it's bad for adults doesn't mean we should ban it, either. 

Being an adult means you're free to make choices that might be bad for you. 

I feel that *crime* should be illegal (hurting someone else, or their stuff) but *vice* (hurting yourself, or your stuff) should absolutely be a personal decision. 

I feel that intoxicants are a vice, at worst. Thus, I do not think they should be illegal.

noblehallett,resumes,1388903406.0,"OK, more info. You listed your responsibilities on the job, the tasks that you did. Possible employers want to see what you accomplished, that you are capable of completing projects, working independently or in a team, utilizing time well,and communicating your ideas in speech and writing. So instead of saying  giving a whole big list off what you did, state what you accomplished. And there are many closely related responsibilities that either could be in one sentence not three or not mentioned at all depending on how important it was to what you trying to achieve.

For example you mention being part of a team, nothing about what the team did. You should state that ass part off a group responsible for x you got y and z done. Try and show them your qualities, not state them because to be honest even if someone were to read your resume they would not find it interesting. 

As for formatting try breaking up your experience based on projects
like this:

Position                    - company, dates
Location

Project 1

-accomplishment #1

-accomplishment #2

-accomplishment #3

-accomplishment #4


Project 2

-accomplishment #1

-accomplishment #2

-accomplishment #3

-accomplishment #4

Now with the formatting you might want to leave some spacing between project listings so as to save the eyes of who ever is reading it. You do not have to use this format exactly, feel free to mix and match what you want, but make it so peole want to read it, even if it is lengthy."

This girl did you a favor. You only wasted one date on her before realizing that she is a cruel person who does not care about your feelings.

I honestly mean it: she did you a favor. She laughed at your dick, but you'll be laughing at her when you get laid with someone who you have mutual respect and attraction with.

I can tell from your writing that you are an articulate and candid person. Please: don't change. Take a break if you have to. But don't stop being an honest and compassionate guy. There really are women out there who will seek you out and love you for it. Maybe there aren't many in your city, who knows, but they're out there.

As for the dick size thing, you need to find your own way of working through it, without a doubt. BUT. It's far from a ""virgin-for-life"" sentence: the most powerful human sex organ is the brain, and if you can find your strength and confidence, you *will* be a great lover. Period, no two ways about it. The right woman will like your dick because she loves you, not the other way around. When a woman laughs at your dick, laugh right back in her face; you have an incredible mind and now she's missing out on it.

Esoteric_Indulgence,TwoXChromosomes,1388903631.0,"Keeping in mind our reproductive organs are a little on the small side, a 2cm cyst is about the smallest size, 3cm-5cm is about a medium size, and anything over 5cm is considered large. So based on the doctor's description, it sounds like it must be on the large side. 

I'm not sure why your gynecologist was so unconcerned with this. It might be a good idea to schedule with Planned Parenthood just for the sake of a second opinion. It's true that small ones and even some medium sized cysts can be left alone and they will subside over time, but a large one can be problematic and needs to be evaluated properly. It's not uncommon for large cysts to be surgically removed.

My only advice to you, as someone who dealt with medium to large cysts for years, is to treat your abdomen with care. Don't poke it, don't strain during bowel movements, don't get hit in the stomach. Avoid positions that cause pain or discomfort. And also know that if this is a recurring issue, some BC can treat ovarian cysts. My gyno recommended BC to me so that I could finally get relief and I haven't had any problems since then."

Expanding a highway may relieve congestion for a brief period of time, but it ends up having the opposite effect of encouraging more people to congest the highway, as well as encouraging business and housing developments that further congest the highway. And whaddya know, within a few years, congestion is back to where it was before construction. 

What would really help is if we quit building so many freeways and instead encourage people to live close to where they work, and have an effective public transit system that caters to everyone rather than being just a basic service for less wealthy people. Houston's doing that with the MetroRail, but Katy and Cinco Ranch still have no public transit at all. "

Cryptonix,Christianity,1388903779.0,"&gt; Right, you're talking past the interesting part: it's not hard for anyone to understand how popularity causes something to become more popular, I'm interested in why it became popular to begin with. Before there were a lot of Christians and it was a worldwide thing. Before they were in power. That part has a lot more to do with the veracity of it than anything in the last 1800 years.

I couldn't tell you the specifics of the distribution, but I've mentioned how Christians had power and could get around from country to country. This all happened over hundreds of years, of course, which is enough time. And it's not like it spread everywhere. For starters, many Asian countries didn't get Christianity. Of course a few hundred years later, Islam came into play, so Muslim countries didn't get it. On top of all of that, two entire continents didn't get it (Americas). It didn't spread as big as it seems. But European nations had a lot of influence on the Americas and Africa, so that's where it stems from there.

&gt; I'm going to assume I'm misunderstanding you--are you trying to tell me that freedom and intelligence didn't exist before a given point? What point was that?

Freedom in some sense, sure, but democracy wasn't big and democracy's where it came into play. Democracy existed in places such as Greece, but that was before Christianity even existed and Christianity's exactly why it stopped existing in Greece. Democracy may also have existed in areas without central government, so there's that. Then we come to the formation of the United States where democracy was huge and the states had immense influence on the world thereafter. 

As for intelligence, it was always there. It existed with and beyond Christianity and religion. However, in very modern times, the distribution of knowledge over technology has allowed more and more people to turn away from religion as we can hear thousands of voices from all different kinds of people whereas without, you get narrow and similar responses depending where you are.

&gt; Sure. We aren't guilty for the sin of Adam. If you need a verse, I'd take a look at the oft cited [Ezekiel 18:20].

I didn't get much from that. You said I'm wrong and I get that, but you didn't explain any reasons as to why we're not guilty. You gave me a bible verse that elaborates, but with my perception of what went down in the Garden of Eden, it's only a mere biblical contradiction."

/r/pcos 

They *can* be controlled with birth control; the theory is that since you will not ovulate that you will have large cysts. 

When I was on the pill I had no issues. I didn't realize though that sometimes an IUD can cause one with a history of ovarian cysts to have problems and because of this every 6 weeks or so I have one pop and have two days of pain then I'm fine.

I do agree with this statement: ""All the pride and conceit of youth unleashed."" My view is that most youthful pride and conceit is unjustified and more a reflection of the individual's lack of experience or insecurity than any kind of wisdom. And these guys appear to be in their 20s, not the preteen years that would explain their behavior. 

I don't think the reality of their work is as ambiguous as you suggest. They're likely somewhat socially dysfunctional, aimless dudes more motivated than others of their ilk but without the social connections to significantly fund their projects and who exaggerate their already odd sense of humor for the camera.

The other 3 guys in the ""Moms"" video don't really bother me. It's mostly Sam, simply because he does not appear to have an ounce of shame in shitting on people to their faces. To me, that suggests a total lack of empathy. I get the same feeling from his other videos."

WinterCharm,WTF,1388904084.0,"Yes. But the virus itself also has a protein coat that protects the nucleic acid inside. 

Nucleic acids outside of the cell's nucleus are rapidly degraded. This is why RNA that's to be transcribed has a Poly-A tail. There's a rate of degradation that occurs, and the length of the Poly-A tail determines how long the complete sequence lasts for protein manufacturing. 

This effectively is one method of ""timed control"" for protein manufacturing. 

Genetic material of a virus is packaged in a protein coat, protecting it from degrading mechanisms in the body (and often also allows for its insertion into other cells). The nucleus in our cells serves the same protective function. 

Denature the protein coat and the virus can't continue to spread, and the viral genetic material gets degraded."

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1388904143.0,"I posted this story elsewhere:

I went on a date with a guy I met online. He ended up sending me years old photos and instead of the somewhat husky guy I was expecting I got what amounted to Peter Griffin - except more so. Guy was fucking tipping the scales at 350LBS. I suffered through dinner with him, and he practically inhaled everything. It was a little weird him watching me eat. 

Anyways, afterwards he asks if I want to go for a drive with him. My brain said, ""NO,"" but I think for the first time and ONLY time ever, my brain was short circuited by my dick. It was a two year dry spell... so that didn't help. I agree and he we drive up into the woods and we pull in somewhere. 

We chat for a bit and I find myself totally unimpressed with this dude. He was 26 and it was his mother's Volvo station wagon. Well he gets out, lifts the gate and invites me out back. I oblige and we start. I'll give him one thing, he gave decent head. 

Well, I go to return the favor... and I have to find his damned cock, which was an adventure in itself.... I pretty much turned on to auto pilot at this point. I went to give him head in return... but he was uncut and admitted he hadn't had a thorough cleaning. This was the only point in my life I wanted to gag from something so foul tasting. 

He tells me to roll over, and I oblige and he had condoms and lube... well we start. I never thought I would have to fake my own enjoyment. I could not feel a god damned thing. The moaning I made came from the fact my thighs were being rammed into the bumper of this vehicle for 20 minutes. 20. FUCKING. MINUTES. (I kept watching the clock on the dash.)

Well he finished and i zoned out until I got to my car. I raced home, smoking I think half a pack of cigarettes in the process (it was a 15 minute drive). When I got home I had a lovely, gigantic purple bruise on my thighs and I later learned that the guy was so small in fact, the condom got lost and I didn't find THAT until a few hours later. 

Ever since, I've always thought with my big head. Even if I am running dry.

Dharmasabitch,funny,1388904197.0,"The un-scientificness lies solely in the politics. The consensus among impartial expert scientists around the world is that [climate change is happening and specific current and past human activities have contributed to the change](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/306/5702/1686.full). When there's a scientific consensus by experts, the prevailing theory is considered fact, or the next best thing. Sure, there's doubt, but it is unfair to pretend that both ideas - that we're not causing climate change and that we are - are of the same probability. So we say, climate change is caused by humans, due to the overwhelming evidence as considered by the world's top climatologists. The fact that they're funding tests for this more and more only gives it more chances to disprove it, but until then, it's the scientific consensus, which is considered impartial to special interests. They are funded by fairly static government grants. The overwhelming amount of money lies with the conventional coal, oil and gas corporations - [it's far more than in wind, solar and other alternative fuels](http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=11391).

&gt;The 928 papers were divided into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, paleoclimate analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Of all the papers, 75% fell into the first three categories, either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position.

&gt;...

&gt;The scientific consensus might, of course, be wrong. If the history of science teaches anything, it is humility, and no one can be faulted for failing to act on what is not known. But our grandchildren will surely blame us if they find that we understood the reality of anthropogenic climate change and failed to do anything about it.

&gt;Many details about climate interactions are not well understood, and there are ample grounds for continued research to provide a better basis for understanding climate dynamics. The question of what to do about climate change is also still open. But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen."

You are misusing this quote.

&gt;the ideas of the feeling like anything can possibly disprespect who you really are is what the buddha said we should let go of. nothing can be disrespectful in its essence, because its essence is your essence, just acting out different karma. 

Actually, it does offend me, but not because I feel disrespected. It's disrespectful to the Buddha, in this case through Tara.

Weight loss starts in the kitchen and coming up with a good diet is essential.  It's hard for me to answer what you guys are doing wrong diet wise, especially since I have a very different diet from most people here.  You might want to (as the other person that replied said) read the book at least.  It gives you a starting point and a foundation to work off of. I ate a ton of Subway and Quiznos my first run (I was still eating meat and cheese at the time) and it worked well.  Additionally, the teambeachbody.com website has a ton of recipes and alternatives you can use and I think a  substitution and eating out guide.  

Changing your diet is tough, and it's hard to gauge what it's like, but I wouldn't be looking at it so much if your results weren't so typical of diet issues. 

Give me an idea of your weekly diet and I can **try** to help you out.  Also, random tidbit- the last two workouts I've gotten from TBB (Asylum 1 &amp; 2) have recommended cutting dairy out of your diet.

NeonGreenTV,lewronggeneration,1388904477.0,"I'm tired of simpletons like this who get on their soapboxes and get followed by an army of other simpletons. I used to be like this AS A TEENAGER but then I grew up and realized that I liked sex just as much as anyone else. The only reason I liked hating people who were having sex , and believe me most teens just say their having sex when in reality a lot of these people don't have sex until their 18+, this is why they grow up to be a bunch of assholes spouting ""kids these days"", when back then they were just like the kids of today.

But guys like the guy in the video sicken me. I'm 24, and I'm say dude is around my age maybe a little older maybe even younger, I don't know. He really doesn't look much older than 27 at most, so I'd say this guy fits right in their with millennials. Also he says he was playing GTA and waiting to do that kind of stuff in the game when his parents left. I assume that if this guy was playing GTA and had to hide it from his parents he's talking about the PS2 era games and he's not that old, so lets say early 00s. 

In the early 00s I was playing GTA, in the 90s I was already playing Doom, Mortal Kombat, and Duke Nukem. So of the most violent and controversial games of those times. On TV there was just as much sex, violence, and just crass humor on TV as today. Remember Beavis and Butthead, remember how Beavis and Butthead caused a lot of controversy? Remember how George Bush(the first one) threw shade at The Simpsons because it was a bad depiction of the American family? Remember how Married With Children and other shows like it were considered low and how 90s entertainment was a bunch of low brow shit and generation x was the worst generation at the time, destined to basically be nothing just listening to violent gangsta rap and angsty depressing alternative rock while shooting up heroin, popping e-pills, and getting pregnant?

I'm 24, I'm a millennial in the truest sense and I was only 10 by the end of the 90s. I don't want to toot my own horn but I was a pretty observant and forward child in those days and I don't remember the past being any less violent, sexed up, or stupid as it is now. I mentioned Beavis and Butthead, which came back in late 2011 and didn't survive a season before it was canceled because it doesn't work with modern teen audiences. And this isn't because Beavis and Butthead was great intellectual content, in fact Mike Judge meant for Beavis and Butthead to basically be a joke on MTV's audience at the time and basically you weren't supposed to look and B&amp;B as role models or cool. 

I'm only 24, and I remember Bay Watch. I remember [2 Live Crew](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIX5bo8MOxQ ""tooltip text""), [Wreckx  In Effect - Rump Shaker](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKKONgfNONU ""tooltip text""), and shit like Cinemax turning into a porn channel at 12:00AM and watching softcore porn like it wasn't nothing while my parents were fast asleep and didn't know I was watching it. Hell, when I got around 12-13(which was early 00s but also popular with defeners as a pure time now) I would steal my dad's porn DVDs. 

Not to mention that R rated movies with sex scenes and shit like that were plentiful and available to kids. But my parents are/were pretty cool, pretty lenient, and a little more liberal than the parents of my in comparison sheltered and religiously brainwashed friends. 

But yeah man, sex was everywhere then and it's everywhere now and it's always been. Check out this [Calvin Klein commericial]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXzR5b6HoIA ""tooltip text"")  with Brooke Shields, which I think is from the 80s.

Madonna's Justify My Love 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np_Y740aReI

And don't even get me started on the countless movies of the time depicting sex, violence, drugs, and other subjects in new ways
Shit, a lot of the stuff you see today had to have had a starting point. Artist, musicians, etc pushing the envelope. 

Sex isn't bad, it's the reason we're all here. Show me a human that was pure and popped right out of into existence and not bought into this world as a result of ""EWW DIRTY SEX"" . Even without ""DA MEDIA!"" and ""DA SOCIETY!"". Kids would still be curious about sex, it's in our nature. Bullshit moralists and other brainwashed by bullshit moralists only exist to control people by trying to tell them natural human desire to have sex and propagate is a bad thing, so you guilt people to try and get them to live this bs 1950s type lie life that was thought up by a bunch of people trying to shove the bible down other's throat, i.e the white man and anyone dumb enough to buy into his past like it was their own.

Do I have a problem with teen sex? No, as longs as it's within the correct age range and consensual. Do I have a problem with teen pregnancy? No, why? Because you have two choices, abort or take care of the kid. Once the child is here, it's here.

I find it funny that guys like the one in the video talking about sex devaluing a person, or don't feel devalued if you aren't having sex when it's people like him who shame people for wanting to have sex, yet you trying to tell them that they're also of lesser value for having sex. Maybe if we would stop telling people that sex is bad and they're lesser and impure for having it. It's like the same people poising you trying to sell you the antidote, but they shamed you for getting poisoned and then shamed you because you took the antidote and didn't just lie there and die. 

The only bad things about sex in my eyes

- Potential STDs

- Rape: Forced unwanted sex

- Sex with minors: I think it's ok if teens want to experiment with **OTHER TEENS**, but legal adults preying on children and teens is a no no in my books. 

- Teen Pregnancy/Unwanted pregnancy period: This is subjective, I'm pro-choice. But I say if you're going to have the baby the only next logical step is adoption or doing your best to take care of it. 

If teens are going to have sex, use protection.

Works identical to the way it is now:

* Person makes trade and records what they believe their points are
* Person eventually submits reference sheet to mods
* Mods review it and give flair, or don't

If you mean the amount of work it would require to update now, it's still simple enough:

* Develop new system
* Clear all flair
* Have anyone interested/active recalculate their own flair points and resubmit it for review
* If work load is too high, add additional mods or temp mods (they already have a pool of people to draw from in the GS ball group)

Having someone sit down and count through everything by hand is insane. Only count through what's been submitted for review, and assume that anyone who does not submit is either disinterested in flair or inactive/long gone.

I've done something similar to this but with a group of 12,000 people. It's going to take a bit of time sure but you don't have to do it for everyone -- just those that are active and want it, and that pool is probably 5-20% of the overall."

The reality is, you're in a shitty situation. But luckily, you want to improve. So that's a great thing. If you stick to this, you will become a better man over time. 

Your first step is going out and confronting your fears head on. It's hard, I know, we all know. But you have to do it. If you aren't strong enough to start facing those fears, you'll never get anywhere. No one is going to hold your hand, because the only person in the world that cares for you is yourself. 

So step 1) Go out and confront your anxiety. Do it as much as possible. Understand that you will come off as strange and awkward. Don't let anyone tell you differently. You will be awkward as fuck. You will fail miserably. Don't fear the failure. Understand that it's going to happen, and just do your best not to think about it.

The first few times are going to be rough. There is no nice way to say it. It'll suck. But depending on how much effort you put into it, into solving something you apparently care a lot about, the faster you'll get over this.

2) Reflect. Don't reflect immediately. Go out, every time expecting failure but working on improvement. Eventually, after all these failures, you'll start getting used to it. After several different times out, you'll start realizing you're half the bitch you used to be. And a few weeks from then, you'll be half the bitch again!"

I train krav maga as often as I can. I'll never be able to take on a guy of equal training, but the more I train, the fewer of those there are. And while I'll always be cautious, I'd like to think I could currently take a totally untrained guy who's about my size or not much bigger.

&gt; And, if you could press a button and make the sexes equal in strength, would you do it? Why/why not?

Absolutely. This would actually solve some of the problems men face, as well - men tend to be in a lot of higher-risk physical jobs because they're stronger and because they're seen as disposable. If women were just as naturally strong, you'd have more female cops, firefighters, construction workers, oil rig workers, infantry, etc. And that's good for the men who are no longer dying in those jobs, because having women there would cause an increase in emphasis on safety, or at very least even things out.

turtlehana,AskWomen,1388905108.0,"Grew up agnostic.

My mom grew up Lutheran and my dads family was Catholic/Protestant though they encouraged the kids to do what they wanted in regards to religion. 

I grew up in the midwest. 

The only things my parents ever said about sex were: (1) If I got pregnant they would be very disappointed in me, (2) Men are dogs, and (3) Only dogs (men) watched porn.

When I was 11 a girl told me that men stick their penis in the vagina and I didn't believe her. Then I remember in 7th I heard about blow jobs on the bus ride to school. I then knew about sex from late night tv but not anything in great detail and in 8th grade I had sex education but that was mostly talking about STD's, pregnancies, labeling sex organs, hormone changes, wet dreams, birth control, and teen pregnancy. Nothing about sex, blow jobs, eating out, and masturbation.

In 9th grade-10th grade my mom left and I helped raise my little sisters. I didn't have time to focus on my self and it never crossed my mind. 

Then I met a boy that changed everything when I was 16. We did fingering, hand jobs, blow jobs, anal, and piv. I was happy to have phone sex (just him masturbating on the other end)... so I wasn't sexually naive in those ways just in the ways in which women can be pleasured or pleasure herself and about porn.

**A combination of what my parents said, not really knowing about sex, and not having any concern/time to discover self lead me to just not know about some things.** "

Anyways, I spoke with someone I know that has some experience dealing with medicare and medicaid billing. They are apparently by far the largest portion of the population in a lot of areas, so if you don't accept them then there goes a LOT of business. They do pay enough to cover their own bills for the most part (depends a lot on the specific treatments), but not really enough to thrive. The big factor though is that there is no two-way negotiation. Medicare doesn't negotiate with the hospital, medicare just says ""this is what we'll pay"", and the hospitals can individually take it or leave it. And they can't take or leave it on a treatment basis, but only on a whole basis. As long as you do more treatments that are profitable than those that are not, it's overall worth it.

noblehallett,resumes,1388905115.0,"Just a cursory look and the formatting of your document is all over the place. Spacing, bullet-points, font size, grammar, punctuation all need to be the same for everything except your name and address. You can bold things like education and work experience but do not bold anything else.

Get rid of the objective, if you have a cover letter you should try and make your argument for what you want to do their. Leave the references part out. 

First thing you should list is your work experience. For your work experience you start out great with work place and position, but then you say things like ""Work in close proximity with owner"", ""Data entry "", ""Meet and greet clients in courteous manor "". Honestly the way you have presented your experiences is boring and uninteresting, if I actually got beyond your formatting issues I would stop reading at your first job description. 

Instead of saying what your duties were, state what you achieved, what your work resulted in. For example "" Met with clients to provide a warm and welcoming experience"", ""Performed data entry for xyz to provide useful data for billy bob in a timely manner"" or ""Worked with owner to perform x, y, and z roles"". Try and show what qualities and skills you demonstrated in these positions. 

Now for qualifications, I would leave that part out and replace it with a section on skills that you feel are important but were not covered by your work experience. 

Now this is just my personal opinion on formatting, but if I were someone looking to hire, I would see the mess of your resume and toss it because you seem disorganized and not worth my time. "

The voting system should stay, but should not be tracked in the form of karma, as that discourages people wanting to raise a silly number, and encourages people trying to get a message out, or just trying to make people laugh. I also think it would discourage emotions from intervining too much on the vote system i.e., he is already negative enough, I don't want to put his karma down too low, or even he gave a shitty story about his hard life, have an upvote, even if it is debtramental to the quality of content."

There's not enough detail. 

You're asking for stuff that's a little vague and needs to be explored more through questions and answers. This is called ""discovery"", and high quality freelancers or agencies charge for this because it can be time consuming. 

The result is a requirements document that outlines all things the project entails. No assumptions. If it's not in the document and you want it, it costs more than whatever estimate came out of that document. 

What you want may be pretty simple but what you've written so far is not nearly detailed enough to say.

mundabit,birthcontrol,1388905479.0,"[I couldn't resist.](http://i.imgur.com/VCBSdjv.gif) The longer you are on a pill the more chance you have of your body adjusting to and then compensating for the change in hormones. I never had much luck skipping periods, I would get breakthrough bleeding very early on in the second pack. I found that progesterone only long term methods like Implanon and Mirena give me longer before the flood gates re-open, and when I do resume getting periods they are lighter. Though Combijnation pills were far more predictable.

beyaz is a rather low dose of oestrogen, if your other brands of combo pills were also low dose, that might be the reason you are getting breakthrough bleeding after a few months. You might need to try a higher dose. if however your previous combo pills *were* high dose, then maybe a lower dose (eg: beyaz) is what you need.

beyaz's progestin is drospirenone, which is very good in managing acne, its also one of the less common ones, so its unlikely your previous pills contained that paticular hormone, which is also good news as it reduces the chance of the same thing happening.

If all else fails and you feel an IUD, Implant or Injection is not for you, consider taking planned periods, while it would be ideal to skip all periods, if you are getting breakthrough bleeding and PMDD at the 7th month, try seeing if taking the placebo pills in the 6th month helps avoid serious side effects in the 7th month, It will mean having to have a period, possibly a long one (in my experience the longer I delay a period, the worse the next period is) but it might mean that you get an extra 6 months of trouble-free birth control *after* that period."
ScipiiRye,TumblrInAction,1388905485.0,"People *assume* it's gender norms that prevent women from applying to typically male-dominated jobs.

She's one of three women because the only other women to apply weren't strong enough to make it despite relaxed standards. No one's telling women they can't be strong, but everyone's telling women that they should be able to get in without being strong.

The problem *is* feminism, in this case. 

If you're not physically capable enough to pass the standard tests, you don't get in. It's not a gender issue. If a woman is strong enough to pass she gets in, it's that simple. People really need to stop reading sexism into stuff."

Bombkirby,pokemon,1388905573.0,"As omegaten said, you have to do SOME research before hopping onto showdown. There simply is no way you could really make a queue for hardcore players and another queue for casual players. You just need to know the game. 

For example, the Devguy kid was using the wrong type moves against enemy Pokemon. Like a Fire Blast against something that barely took damage from it. You have to know type coverage and the types of each Pokemon (and most of that info is written inside Showdown, like you can mouse over an enemy Pokemon and see their type.) And sure if you make a casual queue... then what? There's going to be casual players that know the type match-ups, and they'll make quick work of those newbie players who attempt to use Fire moves against your water Pokemon.

You can win with any team if you properly guess/predict your opponent. There's nothing stopping you from using your favorite Pokemon (even if it is on the weak side) with a moveset that isn't just copy and pasted from the metagame standard movesets. But the moveset has to make sense. (I love doing that!)But you can't like...stick physical moves onto your Alakazam when you can very well see that it's special attack is easily triple it's physical power. And you can even just look at it and figure ""Well... it's a wise and powerful psychic so obviously I should teach it attacks that involve it's mind and not it's fists."" You have to understand the 6 or 7 or whatever stats, type coverage, and what each move actually does. And that's all figured out just by playing through the story and reading what the NPCs are saying (usually the ones at those schools) or trial and error.

The last I checked, developers are highly sought after and are recruited after in college.

The job has the advantage of high demand, high salary and availability not limited to any geographic region (whereas most engineers and chemists have to relocate).

In terms of employment and salary, developers have better prospects than business/accounting majors, which is really saying much.

Esotericgirl,AskReddit,1388905957.0,"I completely understand your point regarding overcrowded classrooms, and it sucks that it seems the majority of facilities/education systems are in this situation. Quality time and a better ability to teach to individual learning styles is one of the things that prompted me to homeschool. 

When it comes to the above, though, if a teacher notices a child is having issues, I hope they will *at the very least* notify the parents, as well as give the family some resources which will point them in the right direction of tutors, etc. There were some teachers when I was growing up who would offer to stay after school with students if they needed extra help. 

If teachers don't make at least basic efforts to help after noticing a kid is having issues, that makes them a bad teacher. 

I also place a ton (though I may be alone in this) of blame for the lack of basic education on the parents that stick their kids in school and don't interact with them enough to know how they are progressing. I know it happens, but I cannot imagine being oblivious to the fact that my child couldn't read."
Jeffreyrock,philosophy,1388905963.0,"&gt; I'm not aware of any theory the predictive power (let alone rigor, or even coherence as far as I'm concerned) as materialism.

It's not a theory so much as an ontological persuasion.

&gt; but do you seriously believe there is evidence suggesting our mind is anything but an... coincidence of physics and natural selection? 

Physics and natural selection deal with the objective material universe.  My consciousness is entirely subjective, ie., it belongs only to me.  There is nothing you can do to my brain that will give you a sense of what it is like to be me-- the closest you could get would be a sense of me filtered through your experiences of being you.  You can't step behind your own self consciousness-- in that each of us has something that's entirely our own, excluded from the domain and reach of objective physical science.  This is a fundamental point-- our conscious awareness is asymmetrically accessible.  With such a glaring chasm between matter and mind it's certainly not crazy to entertain the notion that mind may be something other than a ""coincidence of physics and natural selection"".  

Now the dominant materialist philosophy of our time tacitly assumes that such an explanation will eventually be forthcoming.  For my part, I can't help but observe that absolutely no headway has been made on the ""hard problem"" in about 150 years.  Furthermore, my consciousness is the most fundamental aspect of my existence.  Everything that comes within range of my investigations must necessarily do so through the medium of consciousness-- because of this, lacking a coherent account otherwise, I am left to cling to the default position that consciousness is more fundamental than matter.

&gt;Also, It's not really clear what unpopular philosophical premise you are advocating here.

mundabit,birthcontrol,1388906047.0,"I got Implanon mid-last year. I did gain weight, But its totally controllable, Implanon does not effect metabolism or thyriod, the reason you gain weight is because your appetite changes, Keep track of what you eat with a diary or just be conscious, ask ""am I eating more than what I was pre-implant? am I *really* hungry?"" and you will be fine as far as weight goes. Its not like taking steriods or something where weight just piles on no matter your diet, Implanon related weight gain is effected by diet.

The best thing about the implant in my opinion is that insertion and removal is fast and easy, so if you don;t like it, you can get it removed with minimal fuss, and side effects will easier up soon after. IUDs have the same benefit of being removable, but as you can imagine removing them takes a bit more effort. This is compared to methods like Depo, that are not removable, once its in, its in.

I had quite a bit of bleeding on Implanon and Mirena (Hormonal IUD) I didn;t get much of a chance with mirena, but I've had Implanon for a while now, after a few months bleeding eased up, and I haven't had a real period in about 8 months now, just light spotting. Its unpredictable compared to the pill, but as far as no-fuss birth control goes I'm happy with it.

As far as returning to your old brand, I have done that a few times, I was on nordette for 11 years, and in that time frame I had to take a few weeks to a months break for travel of script-muck ups or surgery. most of the time there was no problem at all. a few times I had a rough first month back, but after a month it always returned to being the pill I knew and loved.

Unfortunately the plot wasn't large enough to bury the dead. He was still alive because his family forgot him in Scotland. It always hurt him when they did that.

Kevin had attempted to sue, of course. No one else did, but that was because there wasn't really anyone left. He assumed that the legal fees could be covered by his business and the rather larger chunk of inheritance he received. He assumed wrong. Endless appeals, court time away from managing his business, legal fees. And still he got nowhere at all. Now he didn't have a penny to his name. And they had the audacity to call *him* crazy. But he knew. He understood that the world had failed him. The justice system failed him. His childhood hero failed him. All in one really bad day.

Nelerath8,AskMen,1388906773.0,"I would almost say the second type lends itself to conversations that exchange ideas/words that are relevant to each other.

When you talk about what happened in your life the only real responses are emotional sentiments of ""Yay"" or ""Nay"" essentially or you reply with what happened in your own life. But the two aren't immediately connected they're just one person's life and the other person's life.

I hate to say it but it's more like the type 2 likes to talk about things that can actually be discussed, the other person can have relevant information to what is being discussed as well as their opinions. I bring this up because it seems to be more complex than simply having them in common. As I am definitely a type 2 communicator following this layout, but if you get me on the right topics like certain aspects of philosophy or psychology and I can chat for hours.

It doesn't seem to be that I can chat about philosophy because we have it in common, though in a sense we do. It seems to be just things we have in common allow for both parties to share relevant information to the conversation. It's not you say fish and I say banana, which is how type 1 communication comes off to me, you say fish and I am either happy or sad for you and then I tell you about banana and you're happy or sad for me, but where have we gotten?"

Hold down the super key (windows key). There will pop up a guide to a bunch of unity shortcuts. They are fricken amazing.

Of note is the HUD, which works in most applications. Tap the 'alt' key to search the application's menus, and that speeds up a LOT of fun things.

You can now snap to parts of the window. The right of the screen, left of the screen, and top are great places to drag windows (to snap to the right, left, and fullscreen, respectivley). For added control you can do a ctrl + alt + numpad #. You can snap to corners, top/bottom, and so forth. It's great for window management.

The standard way to look for applications is now just going to the dash (ie search menu). tap the super key for that. It's a bit slow sometimes, but it's a nice way to look for things.

Ubuntu One is now integrated by default. You get 5 GB of free online storage for whatever you want, and a way to buy music that's permanently kept in sync with any and all of your computers, at least if you install ubuntu one on your mac and windows machines.

Cause it's not really something that can or should be controlled.  I sometimes masturbate to my SO, but I do so because I want to, but sometimes I want to masturbate to other things.  

&gt; and the argument is that you need more than just thinking about someone (e.g. porn) to fap

Not sure who told you this, but it's wrong.  I fap to my imagination all the time.  Also your SO could provide you with fappable material, so I don't see why you bring this up

&gt; if it is indeed possible to fap to a woman you know in your real life 

It is indeed possible, and extremely common.  

&gt; why is it so outrageous for the SO to ask to be the object of fap to her man?

It isn't.  Most couples masturbate to each other using skype, or send pictures to each other to masturbate to.  It's extremely common.  The argument is that some women think that guys should only masturbate to their SOs and that they don't need porn in a relationship.  That's why people get so agitated at this issue, because the real issue is about being limited to what you can masturbate to.  Which is ridiculous.

She says she distinctly remembers astronomy hobbyists with telescopes saying they wanted to watch the moon landing, but the government said they couldn't, because the ship would land on the dark (far, not literally dark) side of the moon. My grandmother will not listen to anything that contradicts her memories about the moon landing at all. 

My dad thinks GMOs are going to have horrible side effects that manifest sometime down the line because he doesn't know very much about biology. There's also plenty of anti-GMO articles floating around that sound perfectly convincing to the uninformed.

What it comes down to is the idea that when someone is transgender, they are actually the gender they identify as. The idea is that who you are mentally trumps any physical difference you might have. 

What makes a person a man/male/a guy? Is it a penis? What happens if that man loses his penis, is he ""less than"" a man?"" Is it chromosomes? I've never had my chromosomes checked, so we (I would wager most people don't get chromosome checks), should stop calling ourselves men or women simply because of something that we can't see or intuitively know. Things along those lines.

Now, gay guys, what are they attracted to? I'm sure a penis is a plus, but is it the only thing?  Is it a guyish personality? Maybe the muscles, or their manly smell, or pheromones? Their hard lines?

They didn't. They told me to ignore him. He kept trying to touch me the rest of the night, even with everyone there. I had to have my ex pick me up at 3am and then *he* tried sleeping with me, even though he knew what happened. 

In the months following I had so many people telling me not to press charges. That he's sorry. That he regretted it. So I didn't press charges. Didn't see the point. Everyone there would've probably said I was lying anyway. Told my family and their response was, ""well that's what happens"".

What exactly do you mean by ""what was originally written""?

If that trip doesn't satisfy you, go to sephora or nordstrom and try to find more, and as well, find a foundation.

Brands to look for (because they are great!): Urban Decay, Lorac, Stila, Nars, Smashbox, Too Faced (only eye products for them, their face stuff even powders make me break out so bad!), cargo, etc.

MAC is a whole other story. If you are going to buy from them, pigments, brushes, lip liners, or lipsticks really.

We ended up at some dingy little motel (the first warning sign) that he wanted to go to instead of doing it at either of our places.  When we arrived, we went into the room and got straight to it.  There wasn't any foreplay, but it took him a little while to get hard enough to put a condom on. 

He didn't want us to get fully undressed for some reason, which confused me.  He made me keep my shirt and bra on, saying he wasn't interested in my breasts and slid in and went at it with lackluster thrusts.  

After about 5 minutes, he finished and then went to have shower in the little ensuite.  I wasn't particularly messy, so I dressed and sat there dumbfounded, then decided to play with his phone that he'd left on the bedside table.  

I ended up snooping in his text messages, because I was curious whether or not he'd told anyone about me and discovered a conversation between him and one of his best friends. It pretty much went along the lines of his friend asking if I was pretty, to which he replied that I was ok but he wasn't really into me.  And finished with the line that will stick with me forever, ""Every hole's a goal.""

Sort of sounds like he's embarrassed, but there may be something else driving this.

It might have been the alcohol that gave him the ED or maybe it was the fact he was hooking up with a good friend.

&gt; This place is as big as it is and as successful as it is because of the way it's currently run and because of its openness to all kinds of trades.

If you want to progress your flair (the subject of this thread), you must trade exclusively in event Pokemon after a certain point.

So logic concludes:

If people want to progress under the current system, then they must trade in event Pokemon, which contributes to a narrowness in trading. Changing the flair system eliminates the requirement that people trade exclusively in event Pokemon, which allows for an openness to all kinds of trades."
5kywolf,buildapc,1388907743.0,"Why he should drop the SSD? Here's why. Because it's his first build, chances are, I'm not saying an SSD is a bad addition but, an SSD isn't a sensible addition for someone on a budget. Unless, he isn't. Where could that money for the SSD go? A better rated PSU or a 'K' edition i5.

Sure, SSDs are a great performance boost man can put to a computer. But that 100$ spent on the SSD can go to MORE sensible investments such as a better motherboard. Hell, he could probably sneak in a 4670k and a Z87 motherboard with a 100$ lee-way.

Why can these systems run at 450W without a hiccup? Simple. Because either the components are underclocked (a little bit, just to meet the PSU requirements), better optimised for its components and the PSU's are likely to have Platinum certification, if that's the case."

Also, another thoughtful suggestion I've read around here is to remember to keep it frugal for your guests, as well. Declining gifts at the reception and working things so that your relatives and friends don't have to travel very far is a good thing to do.

That's just my 2 cents. I'm sure other folks here who have been married or planned weddings will have lots more advice! Also, I think there's some sort of wedding planning subreddit, but I can't remember the name of it right now."

Lightsaber fights and sword fights in showbiz are not sword fights - they're dances. People jumping and flipping and waving sticks around each other. It's choreography and acrobatics.

You can also try flirting with him and making him feel dominant*.  Sexual arousal and feeling dominant increase testosterone levels, which can lift and lighten a mood.  This will actually work much better than jokes and humor, though if he's in a deep depression his libido may fall to the point where he unresponsive to any stimulus.

But yeah, have him get his t-levels checked. Not enough men know about this.

If anything hurts, not just the dull ache of muscular pains you know what i'm talking about. Real pains. STOP and see a doctor immediately.

If they were a group of people more responsible for misery in the world, I could tolerate the cruelty.

People with disabilities shouldn't be sacred cows for instance, but directly mocking the condition which gives them the most grief in life and which represents no threat and little annoyance to others, is cowardly. It's one thing to make fun of a retarded person for burning a cake, it's another to explain to them how dysfunctional their thinking is while looking them in the face. I could poke you in the eye with a sharp stick too, but where's the cleverness?

If your whole interest in comedy is simply the breaking of taboos, what's the endgame? Murder and cannibalism? Transgression for its own sake is a very old idea that paradoxically requires and even demands further censure to survive. If you need to feel like you're breaking a rule in order to laugh, then you're going to need the rule-makers. It's a very weak, co-dependent perspective.

As for your point about the ""true"" target of their humor, I'd be more satisfied with that take if the actresses were definitely in on the joke.

ButterBat,FancyFollicles,1388908901.0,":)  I did the purple myself.  I used **Clairol born blonde maxi** to bleach my hair.  I added it a few inches below my chin (or where I wanted the purple to be super bright), then waited a bit (like 15mins) and added a bit more a bit higher up (like just an inch) and then waited a bit and added it a bit higher up, and so on until where I wanted the ombre effect to end.  Since my hair is so dark, it was a little scary bleaching my own hair, and I was terrified it would turn out awful and I would destroy my hair, but I was short on money so I wanted to do it myself lol :)  I just watched a tonnnn of tutorial videos on youtube and read tons of blog posts and such.  I would probably suggest having a professional do it for minimal damage to your hair, but thankfully doing it myself worked out really well!  After bleaching my hair I waited for it to dry and then added **Jerome Russell Punky Colour** in **Violet** to my dry hair (which I got at Ulta) wrapped my hair in a plastic bag (or shower cap) and hit it with my hairdryer (the heat helps the pigment soak into the hair) then waited about 30 minutes (though you can leave it in as long as you want) and washed it out.  I then rinsed my hair with apple cider vinegar and washed it out (I read multiple places that this helps the color stay).  And that's it!  It starts off pretty dark and then turns brighter after a couple washes.  I put in more color about every 2 1/2 months (I'm a little lazy and let it fade quite a bit before I redo it, oh and I wash my hair every other day) :)  I LOVE Jerome Russell Punky Colour.  It smells amazing which is a plus.  When I first bleached my hair I used Plum, which was super bright vivid purply pink fuschia color.

The last time I re-added color before this photo, was the first week in November, so the color is pretty faded now, but still really visible, as you can see :)"
JazielLandrie,atheism,1388908903.0,"&gt; 14 Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.

&gt; 15 He said to them, ""Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. 
&gt; 
&gt; 16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 
&gt; 
&gt; 17 And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 
&gt; 
&gt; 18 they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."" 
&gt; 
&gt; 19 After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God. 
&gt; 
&gt; 20 Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.

I guess you have to be a biblical scholar to understand how the wording of the text ""these signs will accompany those who believe..."" actually means ""these signs will accompany a few select individuals, of which I've made no mention in the verses before or after this section"". 

It really amazes me the sheer amount of cognitive dissonance some people can live with."

Euryleia,EQNext,1388908941.0,"Sure, there are few such people out there.  The problem is, far more people are accused of being either ""trolls"" or ""fanbois"" than there actually are of either.  Nine times out of then, the person using the term is using it to dismiss valid criticism without even considering it.  ""Fanboi"" in particular seems to get trotted out by critics who, despite their protestations, are absolutely infuriated when anyone critiques *them*.  Just as there are real apologists who go beyond reason, there are also real critics who sometimes make unreasonable and invalid criticisms.  And when people point out that they are being unreasonable, unfair, or just plain wrong, they say ""oh look, the fanbois are out in force"".  At that point, they are just trolling -- going ad hominem is the best way to troll.  You don't resort to name-calling, be it ""troll"" or ""fanboi"", unless you're just trying to infuriate people.

Reasonable critics understand that not everyone is going to agree with them.  Unreasonable ones construct ""armies of fanbois"" in their inner-fantasy-world to explain this.  The less reasonable they are, the more ""fanbois"" they see."

l2ighty,dayz,1388909114.0,"On the DayZ mod the other day, I was at the Balota Airfield (not a good idea) and there was this guy that ran inside the radio tower. I said friendly blah blah blah, the usual. He ran outside and got into a heli that was parked outside (I don't think it was his?) and I asked him if I could get in. He shouts ""YEAH GET IN DUDE!"" so I get in, we go up maybe ten feet and he crashes straight into the side of the building. Not enough to blow up the heli, but enough to where the heli saw the end of it's days. So we both get out and he runs back inside the radio tower for something and I see someone in the woods that watched him go in. I saw him and he didn't see me and I **seriously** thought he was going to attack the guy once he came back outside, so I opened fire on him. I hear him say something along the lines of ""I'm friendly, you asshole!""(?) After hearing that I decide to test him and walk around to where he can see me, he shoots at me, doesn't get a single shot on me while I shout about how I will bandage him and tell him to calm down, I only shot because I thought he was going to kill my new friend. 

So after I bandaged him up, we all stuck together for a little bit while we ran through the woods in search of his friend, who was coming to pick us up in a helicopter. His friend comes in a helicopter, we start flying around, find a heli crash site and we all get out to investigate it. Everyone got good shit but me (there was about 5 of us there, so I guess I was just too slow) and we loaded back up into the helicopter. They ask me if I have teamspeak, I didn't, so I go and download it while we fly around. Apparently we left someone back there at the crash site so we turn back, and on the way there the guy who I defended back at Balota Airfield randomly flies out of the helicopter and dies. Thought it was weird, whatever, we'll find him later. Finally we land and I get just absolutely unloaded on. I have no idea how I got shot, who shot me, with what, why they did it, but I'm dead. I type in the chat and ask what the fuck happened, and all I get the simple response of ""you got shot."" I look at the log and no one else died, so I just assume I was betrayed.

balathustrius,TheoryOfReddit,1388909258.0,"I was thinking along the lines of automation for scaleability. A subreddit the size of /r/askreddit would be completely unmanageable if mods had to redistribute karma as well(unless perhaps moderating was made to *also* cost karma?), and simply dividing it among the top posters would concentrate it and perpetuate a cycle.

The x karma per week scheme could be a function of the size of the active userbase, the collective karma of active users, and the average of a randomly selected subset of active users' karma. Have a user flagged as inactive (not deleted, just not counted by the algorithm) if they don't log in that week. This would keep karma value steady, or could be controlled to provide a slow rate of de-/inflation. It also solves the problem of how to become un-broke if you spend all of your karma on something that utterly tanks - you'd might be penalized with silence for a few days, but will have another chance next week.

Another automation option would be to add a chance for your spent karma to multiply when used, based upon the site's rate of growth. The math could get complicated, but as an example: If you're growing at 2% per week and the average user spends karma once a week, add a 2% chance that any expenditure either doesn't actually cost the spender - *a la* a bank error in your favor - or (b) contributes double to the spendee or (c) splits the difference between spender and spendee (costs spender only half, gives spendee 1.5x karma).

Where to send karma spent on self-visibility? Why not tally it and split it among subreddit subscribers who've contributed during the week? In the latter case, it would stop someone from being permabanned by going broke.

Another way to prevent broke permabans would be to *always* allow a user to post for free at a base value of -4, or just ~~below~~ above the default lower threshold.

I don't intend to come across as argumentative. I'm just thinking aloud. Neither of us is about to sit down and code up AlterReddit tonight.

Edit: Upon re-reading your comment above, I think maybe I should clarify that I was thinking that adding new users wouldn't add X finite karma per user, but rather a base of 1 karma + the weekly allowance necessary to maintain a steady karma ""value."" You could just give every user 100 karma and say ""good luck,"" but that has its own set of problems, too."

ScipiiRye,TumblrInAction,1388909566.0,"&gt; I don't have the numbers, but we can safely assume that the number of female firefighter applicants is lower than the number of men. We should promote even more women to apply and try out to be firefighters, whether this is about feminism or not. 

Agreed. I didn't mean to imply that there are plenty of women trying for these positions, what I meant to capitalize on is that even if plenty of women were trying for said positions, the percentage of women who fail the tests would just be higher, instead of more women getting in. If there is only a tiny percentage of women able to fulfill these roles, why are people shocked when there are so few women fulfilling them? The vast majority of women do what they want, they don't look around and say ""hmm, what job could I pursue in order to fight ""gender norms"". It's unfair of feminists to expect all women everywhere to constantly do things in the name of something so ambiguous as ""equal representation"".

The problem isn't that enough women aren't applying (although this is true), it's that the women who *are* capable of passing the tests aren't applying. That's not a gender issue, that's a matter of personal choice. 

If a woman truly wanted to become a firefighter, she would have to work considerably harder than a man would in order to pass the standardized tests. That's not ""the patriarchy's fault"" or a result of ""sexism,"" like the reasonable tumblr user said, you have Mother Nature and biology to thank for that.

It is entirely possible for a woman to work her ass off to pass the tests and become a firefighter. Many women aren't willing to put in that much effort, though, which is understandable because it's difficult even for a man.

Feminism is the problem here because it's crying ""sexism"" where there's none. It's telling women they can't do things for the wrong reasons. Instead of ""work hard to achieve your goals"" it's ""standards should be lowered, potentially putting lives at risk, merely to maintain an arbitrary ratio of men/women to make feminists happy"".

IMHO that's stupid and infuriating. ""Equal representation"" is such a stupid concept to begin with. If a white man in Parliament doesn't necessarily represent my (another white male) interests, isn't it sexist to assume a woman would represent women's interests simply on the basis of her being female? It's ridiculous."

This is how I'd personally spend 1500$.


CPU: Clearly, you need an i7 for your rendering requirements. The Hyperthreading technology present in i7's are helpful to you in getting those videos to render...fast.

Motherboard: Popular consumer-grade Z87 motherboard. USB3.0 Header. 8 SATA III connections are rated at 6Gbps. What else do you want?

RAM: Colour-coordinated. Also, 1600 MHz is the most speed the motherboard is compatible with.

Storage: SSD + HDD combination is popular in this sub. Put the OS in your SSD, together with your most used programs. Use the HDD for your mass storage. The HDD isn't your normal HDD. Western Digital's Caviar Black is the fastest in their line of Blue, Green, and Red series HDDs.

Video Card: I would've gone with a GTX 780 but I suppose you don't want that ugly Intel stock cooler on this baller build, do you? The GTX 770 is more than capable of pushing 1080p gaming to High/Ultra settings. Alternatives to this is the R9 280x.

Case: Idk about you but I absolutely love this case. It is up to you on the decision though because this is a personal one. The Define R4 is quiet, and has that window to show off your components.

Power Supply: This PSU is generally recommended for it's competitive price, Gold-certification, fully-modular and EVGA stood by it that it won't blow up. http://www.evga.com/articles/00803/

Optical Drive: What could go wrong with an optical drive that are commonly used? There must be a reason why they're still used. Which is that they're reliable and that they do their job well.

OS: You can go with Windows 8.1 if you desire but seeing as you have Win7 there. I wouldn't want to mess with it. It's your choice. The reason I would go with Windows 8 though is that it uses lower resources but then again, I have a low-medium end PC.

CPU Cooler: These benchmarks will help you decide on here.

http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/LGA-2011-i7-3960X-Air-Overclocking,3130-17.html

http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nepton-280l-tundra-td02-water3.0-pro-reserator3-max,3607-11.html

The reason I put a CPU cooler isn't just for aesthetic purposes. If you're running at stock speeds and compare to the stock cooler, you get quieter operation and a cooler CPU which leads to longevity of the component.`



Peripherals: Now on here, I don't have peripherals listed. Mainly because it would go over 1500$. Now, you could take away the NH-D14, and instead use a Hyper 212 EVO for your CPU cooler so you could have peripherals on the list. "

Manateecups,Anxiety,1388909583.0,"Do your fingers change color when they're cold/numb? If so, maybe consider mentioning it to your doctor. I also get cold when I'm stressed, and my fingers and toes turn black. It's called [Raynaud's](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/raynauds-disease/basics/definition/CON-20022916) and here is a little explanation for the lazy.

""Raynaud's (ray-NOHZ) disease is a condition that causes some areas of your body — such as your fingers, toes, the tip of your nose and your ears — to feel numb and cool in response to cold temperatures or stress. In Raynaud's disease, smaller arteries that supply blood to your skin narrow, limiting blood circulation to affected areas.""

Anyway, it can be dangerous if you do have it, since the tissue can die from lack of blood flow.

Kerithlan,pokemontrades,1388909850.0,"They're synonymous in that they're tied to the same system. The concept of a flair ladder is what most new players are going to be familiar with because that's what they see.

The condensed version of what I was going to post is simply:

* New people notice that other people have Pokeballs by their name, and want to figure out why
* They read the Flair FAQ and learn that to be considered a ""Fully Trusted Trader"" they need to get a G/S Ball
* To get that they need a Master Ball, which means they need to trade event Pokemon a lot
* Event Pokemon are traded sparsely and require a hefty investment of Shiny Pokemon if you don't have your own to kick things off with
* Shiny Pokemon can be almost worthless

It's impossible to unlink the trade ladder from the flair ladder when they're built into each other right now. It's exacerbated by the fact that there's an emphasis on things like Instacheck which a decent amount of people have no access to (and is dead now obviously).

These aren't problems to me on a personal level, but I at least recognize why they're problems on a communal level. Not everyone is going to be just as you are, and the best and most readily accessible way to clear up some of the problem is to rebuild flair.

&gt; I never thought that other people would forgo trading here because they felt it would be hard to get a certain picture next to their username.

No, but when the rules, helpful tips, and etc encourage people to prove that they're honest and trustworthy by participating in the flair hierarchy, it does condition the overall new-user-experience.

Even if neither of us cares about it much if at all, it's still something that affects the community that we participate in, and streamlining the overall experience can only help.

tl;dr

* this topic is about how it's hard for new people to break into trading
* the trade ladder forms the foundation for the flair ladder
* ergo, the trade ladder and the flair ladder are one and the same to the new user
* separating the two softens the issue long-term and draws in more users, which self-corrects the problem"
napalmmonkey77,AskWomen,1388909854.0,"I dated a guy with severe depression, but I didn't fully realize the severity until I became very close with him. He was a beautiful human being who had been through rough times and no matter what I did the end result was that he needed time to himself, to figure out his problems alone. Knowing what I know now I would not get into a relationship with any man dealing with this problem until he was healthier... not only for my sake but for his as well. 

That being said if I was interested in a man who had depression I would just take it slow! Friendship is as important to a relationship as the physical stuff and before anything gets romantic you need to make sure you love yourself, and are ready to take on a series of problems...(because worthwhile relationships do not go without arguing and issues). That is one thing I learned very well.. my ex was too overwhelmed when we had arguments because he had other things on his mind. 

And while this is not on topic necessarily, I've been reading a lot about foods that release serotonin (the chemical that makes you happy) and I've been trying to tell people about it! I really believe that nutrition plays a key role in the way we feel... and because there is so much processed junk out there, that we are not getting the nutrients that we need. I may be wrong, but if you want to consciously make an effort to get through your depression, I think nutrition is an easy place to start. :) Other ideas could include exercise, or maybe looking into certain natural herbs.... there is a herb called Rhodiola Rosea Extract that I've been taking that helps relieve anxiety... and so far I can interact with my family much better now, but it may just be a placebo effect kinda thing... haha who knows! Anyway.. 

I wish the best to you. And sincerely hope you can find love, because its an amazing feeling. (You can tell I'm a cheesy romantic). But I also pray that you feel healthier! Going through life depressed is no way to live and everyone deserves happiness. "

As for CB... I wouldn't count on being able to repeat the Marcus Cooper situation.  I mean, yes, he's been quite good for the Chiefs, but he didn't show any of that in camp, and ""most"" late-round CBs aren't anywhere near that good.  The other two late-round CBs we've drafted during the Baalke era (Phillip Adams and Curtis Holcomb) haven't done *anything*. If Rogers takes a massive paycut (say, to half his current salary) and Wright re-signs for near veteran minimum, I can see running Brock/Rogers/Wright/Culliver as our top 4 CBs and holding off on drafting someone; otherwise, we need someone ready to step in and contribute in case Culliver is slow getting back from his ACL and/or someone else gets hurt, and we're far more likely to get that in round 2 than in round 7.

I think my ideal draft would be trading up to get Watkins/Evans/Lee in the 1st, CB in the 2nd, Safety (if necessary) and backup QB in the 3rd, and strictly BPA after that."

You see, everytime we played, my step dad *always* wins. To this day, I still don't know how he did it. But this time... this time, things were going to be different. A great general would rise among the fallen and cleanse the earth of the brown army (I was grey).

I finished up my reinforcements, picked my battles wisely, and through an inhumane amount of luck, I won. At the end I was left with minimum forces on each nation save for the one extra That now resided in madagascar, the last country to fall.

It wasn't even that influential of a novel! It was swept under the rug and ignored until radfems discovered it and started shoehorning it to fit their pre-existing ideologies. 

What bothers me the most about academic feminism is the confirmation bias... ""feminist critique"" really means ""we've already formed our conclusions, how does this text reaffirm them?"" It's so stupid!

sweettenderhooligan,AskReddit,1388910582.0,"Last week. 

Day before new years I got a call from my best friend (S from now on) saying that he was going to the pub and asking if I wanted to come. He was going with a girl he'd met a few months ago (E) and had been fucking since, and a load of her friends he'd met before. I'd yet to meet her, and she seemed pretty cool, so since I wasn't doing anything, he came over and we had a couple of beers then headed over to the pub.

E kept flirting with me, so while I was having a cigarette outside, I asked her what was going on between her and S and she said that nothing was, just having sex. While chatting to both of them, they kept joking about going back to hers and having a threesome, and I (thinking it was a joke, but being cool if it wasn't) said that we should. We sat around in the pub drinking until closing, by which time S was pretty wasted, and left.

A couple of people wanted food, so we went to the kebab shop and everyone except me and E went in to order. While we were out there she asked ""Do you think S would be angry if we kissed?"", so I said ""Do you want to find out?"" and we ended up kissing. S and everyone else came out and me, S and E got into a taxi to hers.

By this time, I'd realised that she was pretty serious about the threesome, and thought 'fuck it, may as well'. We got up to her room and started making out etc. All went fine for a while until S got up and left. E went after him and talked to him, but came back on her own and told me that he was going home. I wasn't sure if I should stay or not and asked her if she wanted me to go. She said not to, and since S and her hadn't been going out, I figured it was fine if I stayed and we continued making out and foreplay. Since we couldn't find a condom, we didn't end up having sex, but I spent the night.

In the morning I left, thinking everything was fine, until I tried to ring S to find out what we were going to do for NYE. He didn't pick up, not unusual, so I went about my day. I kept trying to ring him all day, but it wasn't until I messaged E and she told me that he'd basically confessed his love for her the night before that I realised he was probably ignoring me.

It's been almost a week now and I haven't spoken to him once and I don't know if I ever will again.

tl:dr - Nearly had sex with girl that best friend loves, potentially ruined our relationship."

balathustrius,TheoryOfReddit,1388910595.0,"I agree about allowing users to post for free, but use karma to bolster it. I think there should be a major incentive to spend karma on every post though, thus having free posts start just above the default visibility threshold.

It's probably important not to let people know when a poster has spent their own karma to improve a post, so adding the OP's spent karma over time would be necessary. Otherwise people would see +100 (17 seconds ago) and trolls could hit downvote out of spite.

Should the karma be combined comment and link, or should those operate separately? I'd say separately, but they'd work on the same principles, and there might be a steep conversion rate (ex: 500 comment karma can be 1 link karma).

Sock puppets can screw with the system no matter how it's implemented. You could get around this by weighting karma distribution based upon activity, requiring a proof of unique personhood (most effective, but probably not plausible/viable), scanning for karma transfers between folks who log in with the same IP, etc."

parrot94,LetsTalkMusic,1388910645.0,As a guitarist I found it really cool when I was starting see people who were doing what I wanted to do and being worshipped for it but now that I'm a bit older and a better player than I was when I was 13 I see guitarists like Steve Vai to be extremely talented but incredibly boring to listen to. In regards to the guitar hero as being a part of a band and not a solo act I feel the only 21st century 'guitar hero' is Matt Bellamy of Muse. He gets very into his performance and watching him run around stage whilst riffing and soloing was very inspiring for my guitar technique and 15 year old me found his guitar smashing to be incredibly cool. These days however the guitar smashing and some of his 'stage moves' feel too rehearsed and are missing the spontaneity that made watching him and other classic 'guitar heroes' so exciting

I don't do it out of judgment of anyone, I'm just frugal and enjoy it as a hobby as much as I enjoy estate sales.

But you have to be willing to see other points of view. So what if something was in a dumpster? What's wrong with that? A dumpster is just a big box. And yes, people put gross things in dumpsters and so the nice things can get gross (I tend to stay away from that), but why does that matter if a person is willing to clean things? It prevents waste. Not only does that nice thing not go to a landfill, but a new one doesn't have to be made to take its place. 

The same things that end up in thrift stores, consignment stores and eBay can also end up in a dumpster. Some people don't have the time or inclination to donate or sell themselves.

This isn't necessarily unreasonable. You're both young and have been together for awhile, it might not be a terrible idea to date other people before deciding you want to spend the rest of your lives with each other. But this is something that should be discussed honestly and maturely. If he's sneaking around and lying about it that's a bad sign.

The other reason he might want to want til June is that he just doesn't want to expend the effort of maintaining a long distance relationship. Long distance relationships suck, but they are certainly doable for 6 six months, especially if you feel the person is marriage material. If he's not interested in chasing other women, he's saying that he doesn't want to expend the effort of talking on the phone, texting, skyping, travelling to see you, all the things necessary to maintain a healthy relationship while apart. He'd rather just take care of himself, and then when it becomes more convenient (and when he knows he can get some on a regular basis again), get back together then.

flodnak,AskReddit,1388911414.0,"In 1881, Tsar Alexander II, known as ""Alexander the Liberator"", was out riding in his (bullet-proof) carriage when a member of a terrorist group threw a bomb at the carriage. The bomb killed a member of his bodyguard and wounded several others, but the Tsar himself was unhurt. The rest of his bodyguard wanted the Tsar to leave the scene immediately and get to safety, but he insisted on stopping to see to the wounded. A second member of the same group threw another bomb, and this one killed the exposed Alexander.

Alexander had finalized plans for Russia to have an elected Duma, or parliament. Had he survived that attempt, he would have announced the plan in a few days' time. Russia would have been put on a different road that might have led to a constitutional monarchy - a road that might have meant to Lenin, no Stalin, no Soviet Union.

Instead, his son Alexander III took the throne, discarded any ideas of a Duma or a constitution, and in fact repealed some of his father's reforms."

You find out what chipset and other functions it has, off of ASUS' website.

- let's say it has an AMD chipset - the 970, for example.

You go to AMD's website and get the newest 970 drivers,

- let's also say it has a... Thunderbird sound chip.

You go to Thunderbird's homepage, and find the text: ""We make solutions for retailers and producers, and regretfully cannot service end-users"" - you go back to ASUS' homepage, and download your sound drivers there.

And you just go through this process with every single component of your motherboard - that way you can be certain that you have the newest up-to-date drivers."

The problem could be a software issue, or there could be a hardware root to the problem.  

If the problem is a software issue and is persisting in safe mode, then a repair install should fix the problem.  To do a repair install, find a legit copy of windows 7 home premium x64 .iso and burn it to a DVD as an image.  Turn the computer on normally (ie: do NOT boot from the DVD, load windows normally).  Insert the DVD and let it auto run (if it doesn't, then browse to the setup.exe and run it).  Install windows as an upgrade (NOT CUSTOM INSTALL OR YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR SHIT!!!).  After the upgrade is done, you will need to enter your product key, which is likely found on the bottom of your laptop or under the battery.  Write this down before you start. 

If a repair install doesn't work, in all likelyhood you have a hardware problem.  If you run chkdsk /r and it finds errors, that is a symptom of harddrive problems.  You can also try running memtest, but be prepared for it to run for a day or so.  Good memory tests just take a lot of time. "

They report to someone, whose job it is to get a group of supervisors in various areas to achieve certain results... and so on, and so on.

The Patriot Systems are embedded in society (Law enforcement, science/research, Law, Media etc.) and guide behaviour from the top down.  The thing is, nobody (except for people like Liquid or Solidus) has a big enough picture to really notice anything outside their sphere of influence.  

When the game talks about the Patriots being ""a set of norms"", this is kind of what they mean.  Zero programmed the Patriots with a set of parameters that literally equate to social principles and ideas - as an example; ""self-sacrifice in war is noble"".  This is a hardcoded trait in the Patriots Neural Network, and is somewhat equivalent to a genetic trait in a lifeform, like say... the Fight or Flight response in what is known as our ""reptile brain"" (roughly, our instincts).

So this trait floods every sphere of our social fabric - all decision-making in the financial, legal, military (and most importantly, entertainment and history - see the glorification of Big Boss) so that ""Sacrifice in war is noble"" becomes an accepted idea among the masses.  This idea is then used to help propel the war economy.

She was extremely attractive, and it seemed had slept with every woman within 5km of her university (she would tell stories of going to gay bars and getting evil eyes from the girls there until she made out with one of them, at which point everyone in the place would try to jump her). Plus she was into her ladies using strap-ons, so it wasn't as painful as you'd worry about in the situation.

But yeah...she basically thought that PIV sex was extremely gross. We spent about 3 months up to this point have extremely kinky sex that didn't include penis-vag penetration. But it was so clear that she wasn't into it the whole time I was actually inside her. She thought that sweating during sex was gross. After we had sex (and I took her full penis virginity) I wanted to break up immediately since I realised it wasn't going to work. But I felt really awkward and we tried again a few times.

Fortunately for me, my best friend at the time (who I thought was also a lesbian) admitted to me that she was in love with me, and the girl was totally ok with me making out etc with her (she really wanted to have a threesome with her, my friend and I).

You could work for Siemens, Varian, etc as a sales rep. Since you have training as a medical physicist, you will have an understanding of how current tech works. That will make you an attractive candidate for a position with one of those companies.

You could also apply to work as a full time research assistant in a medical physics lab, but since you don't like the idea of masters or PhD, this may not be for you.

Pick your favorite imaging modality and become a tech at a hospital.

You might be able to find a radiation safety officer position, but I don't think you should look for that at a hospital (of course anything can happen so be sure to check every nook and cranny). Since hospitals already have a medical physicist(s) on staff, one of them is the radiation safety officer. However, anywhere that uses radiation will have one. Universities are a good bet as well as some engineering/research firms (both private and government). If you're feeling entrepreneurial, you could try to make contracts with small medical practices that have x-ray tubes. You would need a lot of clients, though.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is always looking for medical physicists. Every year one of our alumni comes from the NRC looking for people. She says the pay is good and she travels 6 months out of the year (dem frequent flier miles).

3. Trains can't turn as easily as motor vehicles. I-10 may be relatively straight, but there are tons of minor windy curves that might prohibit a train from going at a fast pace.

I get wanting to experience the 'single life', but at the same time it's a little unfair to ask her to wait around while you go and bang a bunch of chicks. How would you react if she said she wanted to mess around and then come back to you.  It's possible that you're open minded enough to allow that but most people aren't when it comes to the person they intend to marry.

The sex is something you need to discuss with her. If you plan on being with her for the *rest of your life* you need to be able to tell her what your sexual needs are and compromise otherwise one of you'll be miserable.

regular-winner,AskMen,1388912506.0,"Well, [here's a start](http://www.villagehatshop.com/content/25/the-art-of-fitting-faces.html). Choosing a hat style should be largely about what kinds of hats work with the shape of your head, at least when you start. It's one of the many problems with the cheap, garbage trilbies people buy at Target or Kohls or wherever--that hat's dimensions just don't look flattering on many people. People just grab hats and drop them on their head and think it's an instant +1 to Style and Awesome. It's not, and it feeds into the fedora hate and the horrible associations we have with them and their wearers.

After hat style comes color and pattern, which should largely be determined by what kinds of colors/patterns  the clothes/outfits you will be wearing them with, and to some degree the colors of your hair and skin. [Art of Manliness covers this in their own hat guide well enough](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2008/05/28/the-perfect-hat-for-your-ugly-mug/).

If you want to add hats to your wardrobe, then shell out the cash for real, quality hats. None of the aforementioned cheap $15 Target specials assembled in sweatshops. Check out places like [The Fedora Store (now just Fedoras.com)](http://www.thefedorastore.com/) and [The Village Hat Shop](http://thevillagehatshop.com) at the least, as they will likely carry just about everything you will need in terms of hats unless you want to start pushing into the $100s or $1000s of dollars for custom designer or luxury brand hats. Also, specific hat company websites are good as well like [Bailey's](http://www.baileyhats.com/) or [Goorin Bros.](http://www.goorin.com/)(although their patterns can be a bit artsy).

My personal advice as a hat-wearing man is not to mix your more formal hats in with your casual wear, and vice versa. Just like you wouldnt wear a baseball cap with your suit, you wouldn't wear your fedora with your t-shirt and jeans. There can be some exceptions though for a more formal styled hat to be worn with more casual wear depending on material and shape; I've worn [this soft, crushable fedora](http://www.villagehatshop.com/product/big-size-hats/239346-296/bailey-tino-packable-fedora-hat-2xl.html) successfully with button-up shirts of complementary colors and nice leather jacket and dark jeans many times without any disapproving looks from people. Straw fedoras/trilbies are also a thing, and meant for casual summer wear. Conversely, don't wear a fedora [like this](http://www.fedoras.com/shop-by-hat-styles/fedora/scala-premium-wool-felt-new-yorker-blues-brothers-teardrop.html) with your t-shirt and jeans, or even a button-up and khakis--you will look like a fool who can't dress himself. That kind of fedora is for a two- or three-piece suit of a matching or complementary color. Also, if you are looking to simply be a little classier than a baseball cap, try looking at various ""flat cap"" styles (ivies/drivers, ascots, newsboys, etc), although keep your head shape in mind, like with all other kinds of hats.

Sorry this got to be a textwall, I just wanted to make sure I gave you real, constructive advice and got you pointed in a good direction to start in."
letsburn00,AskReddit,1388912509.0,"I was having sex with this girl. She was the bisexual girlfriend of a lesbian friend of mine. Anyway, she was extremely attractive, but only 18 and hence a little nuts. I met her once and then she got my number from my friend, with her blessing that I fuck her since she knew her gf needed a guy as well.

Pretty much the next day she's at my place and we spent the next month fucking each other senseless. I had a car and her gf did not, so we ended up with situation that I was seeing her gf more than she was. It all got a bit wierd and my friend asked me to end the whole thing. So I did and me and her tried to get along without the sex.

And then the two of them broke up. The girl I'd been sleeping with called me and asked me to pick her up from work to help her get through all this. I figured I'd be a good friend. She tells me she can't let her grandparents (who she lived with) know she'd left work early, so if she could hang out at my place a while....yeah...we ended up doing it about 4 hours after her and my friend broke up.

We did it a few times, but then a few weeks later my other fuck-buddy (who the girl had introduced me to, they went to HS together) got a bit off and said she couldn't keep just sleeping with me without dating. I then chose her over the 1st girl...who did not take it well. She immediately told her ex and my friend was pissed at me for a few months until we patched it all over.

Lesson? Don't stick it in the insanely hot 18 yr old crazy.

And yes, this is the second post I've put here, I've actually posted another and then realised this example."

* is making a claim that's within their area of expertise

* making a claim with an adequate degree of agreement among other experts in the same and related fields

All of the above bullets must be true, though some of them may be up for discussion, especially that last bullet. Be prepared to be accused of making an *Ad Hominem* attack, however, as most people don't have any understanding of how *Ad Hominem* and *Ad Verecundiam* interplay with one another.

thisisjustmyusername,nfl,1388913010.0,"Depends on what you find to be the most interesting aspect of football. 

If you are into high-powered offenses who light up the scoreboard and make chunk plays on a consistent basis, I would suggest the Denver Broncos. Their quarterback just had a historically great statistical season and is a shoe-in for MVP this year and they have one of the best receiving corps in the league. 

Also consider the Philadelphia Eagles. Even though they were just eliminated from the playoffs today, they are exciting to watch because of their dynamic offensive style that their rookie head coach, Chip Kelly, imported from his time as the HC of the Oregon Ducks. They have the top rushing offense in the league, and one of the most elusive and exciting running backs in the league in LeSean McCoy. 

Check out the Chicago Bears as well. They posses an awesome wide receiver tandem in Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery, and their QB Jay Cutler has a cannon of an arm. 

One can't talk about great offenses without mentioning the New Orleans Saints. QB Drew Brees is a top 5 talent in the NFL and head coach Sean Payton is renowned for being an offensive guru. Having the best receiving tight end in the league (Jimmy Graham) makes them pretty interesting as well. "
