AaronRodgersMustache,golf,1388770273.0,"One thing I gotta say, I used to date a girl who was like that in high school and she banged the ball well past almost all of her competitors. (I know I'm generalizing here) The problem is, she also usually banged the ball well past the hole when she was putting. I seem to find most women spend most of their time on the range vs the green.

I know hitting it further gives a huge advantage in women's golf, but make sure you spend at least as much time on the putting green as you do on the range. She could have went from high 70s to high 60s if she had. 

Am I off the mark or do you find to be like that also?"

BigFishMcNish,49ers,1388770304.0,"Regarding Wagner. His sprained ankle in the middle of the season made him miss three games and then he was rushed back. He was slow coming out of the gate,  couldn't get off blocks, had trouble tackling downhill,  couldn't run with receivers in coverage like he normally does. Then during the Vikings game, he took over and started playing better than last hear even, during a season when I think he should have won DROYover kuechly. He had been having as big of an impact as Bowman on the field. His wpa was over 2% for one game. Anyway,  had willis played all year and played healthy year, then of course he would have made it. But please don't ignore how good Bobby is. You guys are utterly disrepsecting him. He's the number one reason why our defense's run game has taken a turn for championship caliber.

sllewgh,changemyview,1388770323.0,"How many people have to have an allergy before we have to label it?  10,000?  1,000?  100?

Is it more important that we give the consumers the labels they need, or the labels they want?

There isn't enough good evidence that GMOs are at all harmful to people to consider them a risk.  However, despite this, [slews of polls](http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/issues/976/ge-food-labeling/us-polls-on-ge-food-labeling#) show that overwhelming majorities of people (&gt;90%) support the labeling of GMOs.

I believe this is an issue not of food safety, but of consumer rights.  If an individual wants to make a decision not to buy GMO food, they should be able to, whether we agree with that decision or not.  However, they can't, because that information is not available.

I support mandating such labeling.  I believe ""freedom of determination"" was the right phrase here.  I believe the cost of such labeling would likely be negligible to companies in terms of direct costs, and the cost they're avoiding is the loss of customers due to their perceptions of GMO foods.  I will support the rights of a consensus of citizens over the rights of a corporation to earn profit any day of the week."

- Selling ""New"" games out of a sleeve under the counter. (If I buy a new item from a store, I should be able to return it without a receipt for store credit.)

- Individual stores allowing employees to play-test games then sell them as new (back to the sleeves under the counter thing)

They lived at the start of our dead end street, so I had to pass the house every day. Anyway the cat had a thing for sleeping on the top of the garage door while it was open. It was a hot august that year, and they thought it would be great to take the family on a nice vacation. They packed the car loaded up the kids backed out hit the garage button and they were off for a wonderful week of making family memories. 

As they left the cat was still sleeping on the top of the garage like it always did. It had to of been taking a coma or something because as they shut the door it didn't move. The door came to a close with the cat pinned between the door and the frame at the top. The only thing hanging outside was the lower half of the cat, which shit everywhere when it was squeezed like some toothpaste. They were gone during the hottest week of the summer, and that cat just hung there baking the whole time. The whole fucking neighborhood smelled like death. Someone put a bag on it, but no shit that didnt help. 

I remember the day they got home I was out riding my bike. I watched them open the door for the first time. The waft of putrid cat death was so thick i swear i could see it mixing in with all the precious oxygen i like to breath.

mkvgtired,todayilearned,1388770601.0,"Make it a priority to go there if you want to. I am not saying to stretch yourself to thin, but there is a misconception that traveling has to be obscenely expensive. Granted its a costly hobby, but it does not have to be as expensive as most people think. 

Traveling during off-peak times, taking advantage of outside factors (like the British Airways strike), and always checking prices can really help you find a great deal. Also keep in mind the cheapest airport to fly into might not be in the country you want to go to. It could be cheaper to fly into London to get to Ireland, or Paris to get to Denmark for instance. For instance I wanted to check out Northern Iraq, but flying there is very expensive. So I flew to Istanbul and went from there. It worked out better anyway because I got to party in Istanbul before coming home. 

Some sample fares from Chicago I've gotten in the past: 

* Istanbul Round-trip: $550
* Frankfurt Germany R/T: $450
* Into Beijing, out of Shanghai: $750
* Into Hanoi, out of Bangkok: $1000

Like I said, it can be expensive, but it can be much cheaper than a lot of people think. Stay away from hotels and stay in hostels and guesthouses. Check out all means of local transportation, sometimes prices will surprise you. I'm not an expert or anything, but I think I am pretty good at finding deals and overall traveling cheaply. If you have any questions just ask. "

Also, no one is proposing that your food must be GMO free, or that you change how you make or sell it.  It's just a sticker one way or the other.  Whatever it is your company is selling, you could just label that it has GMOs, or that it doesn't.

It was extremely offputting at the time but I reported it in detail to my doctor and she said that wasn't necessarily abnormal. it only lasted about a day I think.

They also have good CC spells to keep enemy in place/pull them into danger/stop them running you over. Their damage is not very high, but the support they provide makes Warriors extremely dangerous.

The Warrior is all about simply busting through everything without a care in the world. Powerful CC through Earthshaker (Hammer Stun), but also some decent support abilities. Their damage is quite high and they are near-immune to Conditions which makes them very tough to stop. While they can provide support to others they do not have the same amount of support as Guardians do. 

**Not-so-Frontliners**

The Mesmer has some of the best utility spells in the game. It's very versatile because it can use Portals to move your raid around and also Veil to grant an unlimited amount of people Stealth for a brief period of time. They have excellent spells that will make your raid much stronger because of them and they can also deal good damage with a Greatsword. Their damage and burst can be very powerful, but it can be risky to land due to the squishy nature of the class. One of the toughest classes to get the full potential out of in larger scale WvW.

Elementalists are primarily played with a Staff in large scale battles as a Backline class. This makes them both a fairly strong damage-dealer, but also an invaluable asset for all the Combo Fields they can put down. They can provide a large number of players with many Boons through these Fields, increasing the damage/movement speed of your entire raid. They also provide one of the most important Water Fields through Healing Rain which can clear Conditions from your raid along with heal them up through Blast finishers. Along with that, they have strong CC. The drawback is that their damage can be tougher to land because it is not instant and requires the enemy to stand in one place for the most part.

In flight access would have been useful for one particular British weapon - a 400kt A-bomb called [Violet Club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violet_Club) which was considered too dangerous to fly in operations when not disabled by being filled with ball-bearings. As it took 30-90 minutes to make ready (on the ground because of the lack of access), and the UK only had a four minute warning period to get the V-bombers off the ground, it was essentially useless other than as a bluff. However as the only reason for the existence of Violet Club was as a short-term response to USAian and USSRian development of the H-bomb, the same need wouldn't apply to those countries."

kicker7955,europe,1388770835.0,"In principle yes, in practice filtering should be done by parents as they see fit, until the child learns to circumvent them, ""like God intended"". 

My main issue is the opt out process, the second issue with this filter is that if there was a guarantee that it would be applied only, AND I MEAN ONLY to ""rape+porn"" I still would be fine with it on principle. But adding terms like gay or even terrorism is limiting the access of information gratuitously.

Also, PM potato head argued that access to the darknet and limiting access to child porn are reasons for the filter. This convinced me that the whole matter is just an excuse for censorship, people don't google child porn, for a wank, and the filter won't stop onion access. The chinese are putting a lot more effort than the brits and there still are ways to conceal tor traffic. Oh, and as a tangent to asia censorship, every restriction measure in the last years was ""sold"" to the public as a *moral* necessity.

Also I find it odd that morality is such a big issue considering the UK has basically no legal framework for pornography, this type of behavior of close everything down:

* won't reduce the demand for extreme pronography, you just create an incentive to monetize it for pedos that aren't tech savy

* won't reduce the number of pedophiles, only increase tehir frustration


* won't limit russian children filmed by albanians within the uk, 

....but including words like terrorism will give the government the power to censor news that might contradict the official point of view on sensitive matters, without any scrutiny or explanation.

(Also terrorist don't recruit using the word terrorism)

bored_criminologist,Conservative,1388770843.0,"His work led to many changes. He did continually subscribe to a heliocentric view, which was something of a minority view. However, his work results in many changes to stellar models.  For instance his discovery of the phases of Venus resulted in astronomers adopting many different models to account for the observation such as Tychonic, Capellan and Extended Capellan models. The reason for these different models is because there wasn't a clear front runner model. Galileo's model was the Copernican model which asserted a heliocentric view with circular orbits. It wasn't until Kepler's laws and his prediction of the transit of Venus that the heliocentric view was demonstrably superior to the other models. After this other models appropriately died away.

Who knows if Galileo could have come to more accurate conclusions if his work wasn't censored and he wasn't forbidden from defending his Copernican views.

Edit:  All that is to say that Galileo's work was not ignored. Far from it. His work that demonstrated that current models were wrong changed minds and resulted in something of a revolution in astronomy. It was never as simple as he said something unpopular and so scientists stuck their heads in the ground. [Here's the relevant wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei#Astronomy)"

If you are going to run away from our debate and attempt to turn this into a humiliation fest, you can bet I'm going to carry the baggage here so people know how this started. [Click here to view the string.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1ub3rq/i_found_what_sounds_like_a_really_great_gaming_pc/ceg9o8z)

Let me reiterate to clear up this sillyness.

After dismissing my selection, (I don't really care about the brand or wattage I chose, lets swap it out for an HX series 550 or 600+ for all I care), you then suggest EVGA SuperNova over higher quality PSU's (such as the HX line, as was originally posted.) Look it up for yourself, it's not highly recommended and there's evidence of voltage regulation issues. If the facts point to me being wrong, I normally fold, but this isn't the case.

It was a silly argument in the first place to get enthusiastic over because the kid wasn't even ready to make a purchase.

This is a rage thread, not a diplomatic discussion.

Hell, I even started choosing higher quality PSU's on average because so many people disagreed with putting a CX model on a $1000 build. **Simply put, the regulars here value high quality PSU's, and I'm not about to argue with the community.**

""why does everyone choose a higher watt CX when the requirements are lower?"" - Simply the build quality is low, and the hardware has a very low tolerance to heat, the extra wattage is compensation so cheap PSU's aren't running at capacity.

Regardless, you totally bailed on the previous discussion when I got onto you about quality.

His offensive competition is middling. 

Though he has posted similar numbers throughout his career, what has changed is the offensive output of his competition: in 08/09 he was iced against the top forwards of the day, with the likes of Eric Staal in front of him. He continued in this role for a few years. In 13/14, he's being used sparingly as a 5/6D. What changed? [This changed](http://msn.foxsports.com/nhl/player/tim-gleason/injuries/342723?q=tim-gleason).

I'm hoping this transaction is a means to an end. It's transitional. Something else is likely to happen between these two clubs.

Also keep in mind that this doesn't particularly hurt us. As much as I liked Liles, he wasn't contributing in a large way to the squad this year, and neither will Gleason.

According to Windhorst and Shelburne, the Lakers are insisting on at least a young player on the Cavs or a future first round pick and that is confirmed by Jason Lloyd of the Akron Beacon-Journal. 

Lloyd writes: ""The Lakers keep insisting on an asset (I’ve heard Sergey Karasev's name mentioned) or a first-round pick and the Cavs aren’t interested in giving away assets. The offer is simple: If the Lakers want to get out of the luxury tax and avoid the repeat offenders clause next season, this is their way out. If not, the Cavs can simply release Bynum ...""

Cygnus_X,Bitcoin,1388771244.0,"Besides being 'noninflationary', Here is why I like it.

I have a property that went underwater in 2009.  I cannot sell it without paying someone to take it, so I rent it.  How do I go about obtaining rent payment?

Traditionally, I go to the property and pick it up and then take it to my bank to deposit it.  But that costs me time and money.  I could have the tenant mail it, but that costs them time and money and it also makes me dependent on the postal service for delivery.  What happens if the postal service loses the check?  And once I get it, how long does it take to 'clear' before I can spend the funds?  Then, what happens if a check bounces?  Guess who pays for a bounced check?  I do!  The bank will charge *me* a nice $25 fee for someone else bouncing a check.  And if I withdrew enough funds after the check cleared and before the check bounced, I get hit with *another* fee called overdraft.  And after all that, I get to go through the whole process all over again to get another check.  

A better solution is Bitcoin.  When I get home, I pull up my wallet and see if any funds have been deposited today.  If they have, then I am secure in my knowledge that I have my money.  At this point, the payment will not bounce, and I can immediately spend it without waiting for it to 'clear' at the bank.  All my troubles above have been resolved through Bitcoin."

That's not a complete government takeover and to market it as such is misleading, disingenuous or ignorant.  Single payer means there is a fund that everyone pays into that will cover basic medical treatment for all citizens.  That does NOT mean government hospitals, government doctors or the elimination of private insurance.  What it does is create a base level of competition for private firms and control the exorbitant cost of healthcare in America which is currently out of control regardless of whatever reasons you want to point your finger at it remains true.

My own plan (40% flat tax, $15,000 UBI) has the ""break even"" point at around $37,500, as in, you have negative tax below that. This is $75,000 for a married couple due to two people receiving UBI.

phantom_eclipse,MakeupAddiction,1388771301.0,"I play cello in an orchestra at a church. I can generally paint my nails whatever color I want, but any super colorful makeup is out. As in- no bright red lips, no super bright eye shadow, just sorta neutral makeup or black liner and maybe darker colored lipstick as long as it isn't 'extreme', cause it's a church you know. Recently some singer wore SUPER BRIGHT red lipstick (think Kat Von D's Outlaw) and I could *feel* the disapproval of all the old coots in the audience.

As far as tattoos, you can have them but they prefer they not be visible unless you're in the Contemporary service. Since I play for the Traditional service my tattoo gets to be covered up which is easy anyway. 

And dress code is all black with nice black shoes, which is the dress code for most music gigs. I could dye my hair if I wanted, but I choose not to. And I have a nose ring and no one cares lol, but if I got something more 'extreme' (like an eyebrow ring) I'd probably get talked to.

Rating albums on a 1-10 scale, or 5 stars, 4 records, etc., etc. When it all boils down, all that's left is whether or not you like the album. You can listen to other people's opinions and often get a good idea of whether you'll like it (if they have similar tastes as  you, you'll likely enjoy similar things), but in the end no one can make you like or not like an album, that's up to you. You don't have to be a critic to enjoy it, I think often when people get into critic mode they ruin things for themselves that they might otherwise like. 

That's not to say you shouldn't judge it for it's production quality or whatnot, but that's up to you. Just listen and enjoy what you want for what you like. Simple as that. "

African-American men were screened for syphilis in 1932 and 399 were identified as having the disease.  They were followed-up by physicians for 40 years in order to observe the natural history of what happens when people are infected with syphilis.

The subjects were not told they had syphilis.  When penicillin became widely available in 1947, the study physicians did not give it to the subjects; and, what is worse, they actively prevented the subjects from receiving treatment elsewhere.

Medical ethics were not unheard of in 1932; the people who conducted this study simply felt free to violate them.  On the positive side, this story is taught to medical researchers today and nowadays all medical research is reviewed by Institutional Review Boards to ensure subjects are treated ethically."

When normal people shake hands, they extend their hand and wait for the other person to extend theirs, they don't grab the other person's hand and start immediately shaking it.

Thus, the federal government reviews the state's assessment, approves it, and thus the states and federal government share the burden in making sure people can live.  

Seems like some webbing to untie, but if we acknowledge the hidden truth that cost of living differs by state and by locality, then maybe a national minimum wage is not necessary, but a federally reviewed, state-set minimum."

The colors are actually what draws me so much to this fit. When combining colors in an outfit (or, really, in anything), it's easiest to look at a color wheel to see how they work together. The large block of brown in his pants have a somewhat muted orange/golden tint to them, which works with the complimentary large block of blue above it. The gingham shirt shares both of these shades (the warm of the yellow and red vs. the cool of the green and navy), and can threfore be seen as tying the outfit together (even though it's barely visible) while still being busy and odd enough that it adds a bit of flash. Moreover, most of his outfit is pretty warm, which is why I love his choice of blue sweater: it's not your normal cold blue, but more a toned-down and greyed version that simply cools the outfit without clashing with it.

I also really like the use of different textures as well, because none of them clash and each makes the choice of garment more interesting than a ""plain"" version of that garment would have been.  He looks more rustic and outdoorsy with the cord pants and corded sweater - a look that works great with the sunny coastline of New England. 

Ultimately, you may think all of this is a bunch of poppycock, and I respect that. However, the guy isn't just haphazardly throwing things together; he's working with pretty basic principles. I think the reason I like this fit so much is because it simultaneously combines basic principles with a few different risky pieces, and, in the end, seems to come out with a working outfit that's a lot more interesting than what I could have come up with had I been in a rush and needed to throw some stuff on (which was the original reason I posted this picture; *that* is where I want to be at some point).

Hoodwink,OneY,1388771801.0,"&gt; Its still ""not OK"" for a smart man to not have a higher-income job.

That's because a lot of smart men actually seem dull and retarded outside the context of their jobs, work, and passion.  They can pass for normal outside of the context of jobs, but often they come off as 'off' in some way (that's often 'dangerous' and not in a good way).  That's why I mentioned them being in their parent's basement or a shack in the woods.  There is a general weirdness with more intelligent men because they usually don't value or don't understand or haven't practiced social norms.

And women are the ones enforcing these norms.  It's not that the men aren't there.  Higher-earning women retain the same natural gender attraction that they would have if they weren't high earners. They often have much higher standards.

&gt; due to the societal pressures, any man who is smart / well-educated enough to get a good job feels that being a househusband would make him ""not a man"".

Not societal pressure, but dating pressure from women.  If you ever dated women who have had money that you don't have, you can see the paranoia about money in their eyes at every date.  You can tell they feel like they're being used or a hesitating about bringing out the cash/credit in a telling way.  Other relationships I have seen where a man pays for her at some turns doesn't seem to have this paranoid dynamic AT ALL unless the female sexually teases another man or she wants to go out to clubs/bars too much.  And that can't really be separated from the rush of paranoia from jealousy/territorialism.

It's not that men think being a househusband would make him ''not a man''.  It's that not having a career would make a man ''not a man'' in the eyes of a higher income woman.  I don't think men are shying away from being a house-band, but rather women are not choosing men that would and could become house-husbands.  It's a women's choice here.  She has the power."

Like most of the people said, that other guy is just a crush and because he's not with you he'll flirt and be pretty much an ass. I've been through this before. I had a pretty great boyfriend and started working at this other place where a coworker would flirt with me all the time even though he knew I had a boyfriend. I liked him a lot because I'd see him every day and he was also older than me. 

He did everything to make me fall for him including telling me that he wanted me and wanted to be with me and I ended up breaking up with my boyfriend. I went out with the guy a few times and slept with him a lot but when it came the time to talk about being in a relationship the guy just walked away and he ended up being with someone else.

This is just a crush you have. If you end up things with someone you really love for someone who you have only a crush on, it won't end good.

If the guy can't respect your relationship with your current boyfriend then he's definitely not boyfriend material."

One day, Jeffrey complained to his friend, ""My elbow really hurts, I guess I should see a doctor.""
""Don't do that! There's a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything, quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10.""
Jeffery figured he had nothing to lose, so he took his urine sample to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:
“You have tennis elbow.
Soak your arm in warm water.
Avoid heavy lifting.
It will be better in two weeks.”
    Late that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.
    He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited $10.00. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:
“Your tap water is too hard.
Get a water softener.

Your dog has worms.
Get him vitamins.

Your daughter's using cocaine.
Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.

Your wife's pregnant - twin girls.
They aren't yours.
Get a lawyer.
And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better.”"

SkyGrass,psychology,1388771983.0,"Sorta, but I feel like this was an evolutionary trait to better ""adapt."" If a population of early humans lived in a dangerous place full of poisonous animals, the humans who grew to fear them and stay away from them would avoid them, thus surviving and passing on those traits of fear to their children who would also avoid them. Kind of like how when ducks are born they automatically know how to swim, or how turtles just know to go to the ocean after hatching. 

This is all just speculation though but I think even pigeons could play a role since their tolerance to humans have been changing through the years, especially in places that encourages feeding pigeons. Their epigenetics are changing enough so that future generations are less willing to fly away when approached by humans.

Actually, now that I think about it, even domesticated animals may have been like that. I'm pretty sure ancestors of dogs and cats were not as tame as the ones you see in households today.

Corbenik,whowouldwin,1388772041.0,"&gt; They have casual time travel. They have unlimited time.

Actually, they do need some amount of time to get their grounds. The planet acts as a central hub I can guarantee that the Chaos Gods (among other things) would immediately know if something of that scale just popped into existence. They're also unwilling to interfere with their own timeline. A time lords MO when scouting new places is to interact with that place, get their grounds, and then attempt to use the populace to their advantage. This is a terrible idea in the 40k universe.

&gt; The Chaos Gods aren't more powerful

That was poorly worded on my part. The Doctor was possessed by something in *Midnight,* and the Chaos Gods (and more importantly their daemons) are significantly more powerful that.

&gt; The Chaos Gods have no feats above the galactic scale.

They don't really need to. The most powerful aspect of their warfare is something that the Time Lords are particularly weak against.

&gt; It's also hard to believe the more corruptible Time Lords would be willing to work for beings as weak as the Chaos Gods rather than just trying to overthrow the Chaos Gods with some uber tech or other.

I've only recently gotten into the books, but I'm pretty far into them, and from what I can tell that's not really how corruption works in the 40k universe. People are typically corrupted when they want to do *good.* They're put in positions where they make small moral concession to Chaos Gods for some greater good. These concessions grow in size until the original meaning of the sacrifice is lost. Most entities that directly seek out power from the Chaos Gods attempt to make a more short-term deal that becomes elongated by circumstance.

I'd certainly agree that a bloodlusted and focused race of time lords could win handily, but we're dealing with a race of beings that's constantly plagued by indecision, poor decision making, moral corruption, and lack of foresight (something that's difficult to accomplish when you can see the future). For the 40k universe, this is a breeding ground for Chaos. "

If it were a serious-enough issue, it would probably be a bombshell no matter when it was brought up. For me it would usually be the case of the earlier the better. I don't have much experience with the casual datting approach, but I would imagine after one or two dates and we begin to notice a chemistry or hint things may have the potential for something serious forming, it would be a good time to be open about something chronic like that.

I have had relationships with women with mental health issues before, and it usually came out even before we were officially in a relationship, and I took it as it was.

For me the hardest thing is that both my fiancee and most recent ex (who was also a LTR) have the same allergy/intolerance to whey protein (not lactose though) and distaste for all cheese except small amounts of mozzarella.

If any of these are messed with I get massive anxiety that ranges to having to start over, panic attacks, or incredibly large freak outs that render me useless for hours.

Big stuff though?  Eh, whatever.  I don't plan anything other than doctors more than a day or two in advance.  I do this because when I start to plan out further than my already set routines I'll do the same over scheduling on everything.  For a while I had a whole daily routine set up to the minute.  If I'm supposed to eat lunch at noon and it's now 12:05 I'm upset and anxious.  So I try now to keep the routines to smaller things so I'm not so inflexible at all times.  I also do this because my mood fluctuates and I hated when I would plan a few weeks in advance to do something with someone, wake up depressed or overwhelmed, and have to cancel plans that had been set for a while.

JonWood007,changemyview,1388772089.0,"While I'll partially agree and say that hatred toward GMOs is overblown to the point people just blindly rail against anything GMO, I think there are several legitimate concerns in regards to them.

First of all, they haven't been adequately tested in a lot of these GMOs, and as such there is the potential that they may be harmful in some cases.

Second of all, we are not really informed of what food IS a GMO, and what is not. There's no transparency, and a lot of deception involved. People want to know what exactly they're eating.

That being said, I think GMOs hold some promise, and I'm NOT a blind hater of GMOs, but I do think more rigorous testing and more transparency is a must. A lot of the arguments against GMOs aren't ideological, as much as they are about legitimate issues like testing and transparency."

I find that while it completely eliminates all of my armpit sweating, sometimes it can make me sweat more in other places (palms, feet, even my back) if I'm really hot and my body is trying to cool down.

Mashiara,GirlGamers,1388772351.0,"A game like DayZ minus zombies or whatever (I'd say like The Division, but it's not out yet) that incorporates Google Earth and has other players as your main threat (or allies). Post apocalyptic (virus, flu, whatever... not nukes), you start out wherever you actually live. Your city/town/neighborhood. Walking the streets in the game would be the same as IRL. Players can help by marking a building front as ""grocery"" or ""outdoors store"" or ""vet clinic"" etc and the game will generate the inside of the store based on various templates. Servers are regional and you have to travel from one place to another (can't just spawn in Chicago if you started in Houston).

 You can attempt to ""occupy"" buildings and try to create a player service (an inn, a trading market) if wandering isn't your thing... but be careful who you trust. 

 Real time survivor simulation using RL locations. Yup.

Edit: Each player would start with a randomly selected ""occupation"". A player can teach another player these skills, but players will be limited on very few (one major and a minor that someone else has to teach you). This way, people will be inclined to work in groups to survive. Want to occupy Woodsbury? You probably want to find a civil engineer, a politician, possibly law enforcement. You can learn how to be a surgeon but it would take a long time and you'll never be that good at it. If you spawn as a Doctor you know you'll be highly sought after but if you're a dick they'll just learn what they can and abandon you or kill you. Outdoorsman? Carpenter? Cook? 

You can use your skill or just disregard it entirely.  Just because you're not a hunter doesn't mean you can't, just means you have to work a little harder.

mkvgtired,pics,1388772422.0,"&gt; Although growing and wholesale is fully illegal and in criminal hands.

The next logical step would be to allow legal production to keep organized crime out. That was part of the reasoning in Colorado and Washington. On the Federal level, the Obama administration told both of those states they had to keep production from falling into the hands of Mexican cartels. That was one of the conditions these states have to abide by to keep Federal drug agents from intervening. I think that is a completely reasonable request. As a Chicagoan, Mexican cartels contribute immensely to our murder rate, mostly due to the drug trade. This is a similar story in many US cities. Their involvement in the drug trade causes far more murders in Mexico.

I have always wondered why the situation in the NL evolved the way it did. Do you know how sales became legal but production didn't, or what factors led to that? Unfortunately given the pressure from your neighbors and the EU I dont see marijuana laws becoming less restrictive in the NL anytime soon. With how close the pot card verification system came to passing, I can only see them getting more restrictive unfortunately. What are your thoughts?"

&gt; Give yourself some time. It's going to hurt. That's okay. You may be sad and angry for a while and that's okay too. Everyone grieves differently. The best thing you can do is keep living your life. Try to do things that bring you joy. If you need to be alone, be alone. If you need to be around friends, then be with your friends. It all depends on what makes you feel better.
&gt; Don't let anyone tell you how long you should wait to be in a new relationship. Do what feels right for you. You don't need to rush into anything and you don't need to push someone away if you feel a connection. You will figure out what is right for you.
&gt; Best of luck. I'm sorry you're hurting and I hope your heart mends soon :)

That doesn't mean I'm going to start controlling him or telling him he can't talk to her or anything though, because that would be nuts unless the situation starts to escalate. I can't help my feelings. My SO loves snowboarding and the whole ""hipster"" style. I hate snowboarding, and I don't usually dress like that (mostly because my fashion sense sucks). If I see him talking about snowboarding with a girl who is wearing clothes he finds attractive, yes, I'm going to get a little bit jealous. 

I know my SO is not going to do anything because I completely trust him and I know he loves me and respects me. But she has traits that I wish I had, but don't. I think it's completely normal to have those kinds of feelings. What is NOT normal is acting on them unless it starts going too far.

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1388772837.0,"She seems to have this idea that you're suppose to just willingly trust her no matter what, and that's not true. It's earned. If she's giving you a reason to not trust her (like change in behavior and being secretive) then she can't blame you for not trusting her. She's only getting so hyper defensive because she *knows* what she's doing is wrong, and *knows* if you actually get suspicious enough to look you'll found out the truth.

Call off the engagement. Even if she isn't cheating on you (yet), you cannot marry a women who is acting the way she does. It's completely immature and terribly selfish. If my boyfriend was concerned because I suddenly got more protective of my phone, that last thing I would do is get upset at him. Unless he was constantly paranoid about this stuff (which you aren't), I would trust that this is something he's really concerned about and not just letting anxiety or something control that. 

Her lies suck. If he was just a friend she would be open and honest. If you've always trusted her I'm assuming you're okay with male friends. Unless you have trust issues that your constantly projecting onto her, her excuse of, ""I knew you'd be upset by our friendship,"" is just plain insulting. If you think your SO would be upset at a relationship you're having with someone, you need to think long and hard at whether the ""friendship"" is worth it. If they were just platonic friends you'd have nothing to be concerned about, and she knows that. She's *really* manipulating the situation here and turning it onto you. ""I was doing this to protect your feelings."" ""You don't trust me."" ""This is your fault!"" 

Nope. Not okay at all. You need to be firm and say something like, ""I know you're cheating on me. You can twist and manipulate the situation all you want, but if you don't tell me the truth right now we're done. You have given me *so* many reasons to not trust you, and if you cared about me at all you would stop lying to me and making me out to be the bad guy. If your ""friendship"" with this guy is so important that you need to lie to me about it, then we have no place getting married or even planning a future together."" "

noc007,DataHoarder,1388772903.0,"This sickness started about 2003. I was downloading a lot of...stuff as well as needing storage space for pictures and other documents. I put a system together with old parts I had laying around and ran OpenBSD. I bought a used IDE raid card that had a RISC processor and RAM; this was a hard find (I need to see if anyone will buy it on eBay since it's collecting dust) and was the max spec length of a PCI card. I put in 4x120GB drives as a RAID 5 and had an offline spare I never used in case of a failure. This yielded a tad over 300GB of usable space which I promptly filled up within a year or two. I added 2x300GB drives to a Promise FastTrack card with the firmware reflash in a RAID 0 to store the stuff I'm ok loosing.

By 2008 it was showing it's age and I was regularly deleting stuff just to manage space. I built a mostly new system reusing the case with 3x 1.5TB drives. I switched to FreeBSD for my OS since it could do ZFS and booted it off of a USB stick. The drives were put into a raidz1 with 2.7TB usable. I ended up getting distracted in the file transfer and lost a bunch of stuff.

In 2011 I came across a steal for a HP Microserver for $50 new. I don't know why it was so cheap, but I couldn't give them my money fast enough. My budget was tight and I couldn't expand the 2.7TB that was already full and getting crap deleted. I was wanting to build a HTPC for a while and this would free up hardware to be repurposed. The cool thing about the setup is I could plug the USB stick with the OS onto the mobo and I only needed to make a change in the BIOS to boot. After that the only change I needed to do was setup the new NIC; ZFS didn't bother me with finding the drive and just mounted it

A few months later in 2012 I come down stairs to hear the wretched noise of one of the HDDs failing. I wasn't that concerned about it since I could lose one drive; this was a mistake since they were made around the same time. Two weeks later another drive went down due to the controller and in hindsight I should have just taken the drives offline until I could replace the failed drive. I got my hands on a replacement drive with the intention of swapping the board, but later found out that I need to copy some settings from the firmware and the process is beyond my expertise. So the data isn't entirely lost, but I've had to move on without it until I could find someone that can take the job.

BlackFriday 2012 brought good fortune with 3TB drives for $100/ea and I snagged 4 of them to start over and tried to ensure they weren't made on the same date. Because I don't access the data regularly, I'm also having the OS spin down the drives. I've got the irreplaceable data backed up between AWS S3 and Pogoplug cloud. I know Pogoplug uses S3 as well, but it was cheap and I think I've got enough copies to accept the risk.

That's about where I am now. I haven't filled the drive yet since I just don't have a whole lot of motivation to rerip all of my DVDs for now. Next on my list is to replace the HTPC as it's showing its age. I've been thinking about getting an Intel NUC to do the job and even considered one to replace the desktop so I can re-purpose that as an ESX host for learning labs. I've also considered buying a used C6100 off of Ebay for an ESX cluster, but the affordable ones have Tyan nodes and they don't particularly have the best track record IMHO. I also need to get a good quality scanner to digitize old family photos and documents. So much to archive, so little money and time.

HD408s were my first ever set of headphones and I only paid $65 for them 

It's not as bad as it looks, I swear! I appreciate the advice though! You're definitely right about the lighting though, they did a shitty job of setting these places up. I used to have a couple of lamps but they were slowly replaced as I acquired more stuff... Because, you know Lamp &lt; Darth Vader Helmet

I do have plans for the monitors, they're pretty long term though. I have it worked out that I'll be able to put a down payment on a house in a couple years here, and by that time I'm thinking the 4k OLED panels will be signigicantly less expensive. I've already designed a system that will allow me to integrate the monitors into one of my walls and essentially use the entire thing. Suprisingly, it won't even cost that much! It's a future plan though, only time will tell what happens! In the meantime, maybe some 27s..."

BullsLawDan,changemyview,1388773038.0,"&gt; There is a big difference between a medicine that you can choose to take and medicine that you have little to no idea whether you are taking or not.

So?  We have plenty of science stating the GMO in our food supply are safe.  Moreover, there is absolutely no science linking the GMO in our food supply to any ill effects on people.  

&gt;We have made mistakes, costly mistakes, with our food supply in the past. There was a belief that transfat was actually Good for you for a very long time. I think it was a silly and costly mistake to widely use it. This has the potential to be much more costly and perhaps irreversible.

This is what is known to intelligent people to be a *logical fallacy.*  It's called an ""Appeal to Tradition,"" or an ""Appeal to History.""

Merely because ""we have made mistakes"" in the past does not mean that *this* is a mistake.  Your argument is akin to saying that we should not explore solar power because our ignorance of the sun in medevel times led to lots of people getting sunburned.

&gt;Caution is not misguided zealotry, even if I expect that GMOs are safe it is silly to claim that we suddenly MUST implement GMOs everywhere NOW or the entire world will starve.

This is another logical fallacy, known as the ""strawman.""  Confronted with a good argument (mine), you have instead grossly misrepresented my position by restating a bad argument, and arguing against that.

My only argument is that your phrase, ""quite reasonable,"" is irrelevant here.  Science does not determine what is ""quite reasonable,"" it determines what is true.  It's pretty amazingly ""unreasonable"" for evolution to produce an animal that literally escapes predators via the use of internally-produced explosives, but, alas, the bombardier beetle exists.

I could just as easily say it is ""quite reasonable"" for GMO to be completely safe.  It's a non-starter as a position."
Gre3nArr0w,politics,1388773040.0,"I'm not saying everyone is like this but...

Why do people feel entitled to being wealthy? People seem to have this assumption that the people who are wealthy got lucky, Sure it had some luck but the wealthy people usually are the ones who worked non-stop, didn't waste money on things they didn't need and actually saved money.

Plus 80% of all the wealthy people are first generation millionaires. Meaning they didn't get their money from inheritance. 

One of the reasons the lower class will stay in the lower class is because they waste so much money on non essential things.

/u/vanguard_anon said something along the lines of this ""there are 3 ways the lower, middle, and upper class live. The lower class sees wealth as the amount of ""stuff"" they have, they will spend money right when they have it because they know it will be gone tomorrow, the middle class sees wealth as the amount of money in there bank account, the upper class sees wealth as power and uses money to change the world around them. Everyone should try to see wealth as the middle class""

And lets all be realistic here, If you were to put a lot of people in the position of upper class and hand them the money, a lot would waste it away faster than it came.

Some people just aren't made for the upper class lifestyle but we can all aspire to try to live in the middle class lifestyle by saving money."

Money sitting unused in bank accounts does nothing for the health of the economy. 

Keep prices level when a minimum wage hike happens and you see demand soar. Yes, you could raise prices to offset this, but you are then at the mercy of your competitors if they don't do the same. "

I got it to reward myself for a promotion and because I wanted to try out more NARS stuff. The primer that comes with it is amazing and I will be buying a full size when the sample runs out.

carbidegriffen,AskMen,1388773223.0,"It would depend on the type of illness and how big an impact it might have on a relationship.  
Most things I'd want to know early, 2nd or 3rd date.  Things that I would want to know: terminal illness, expected rapid decline (like expected loss of mobility, sight, etc.).  
I would want to know these things because, personally, when I was dating (I'm married now), I was seeking a partner who wanted a family and liked to travel and camp.  Everything that I mentioned above are things that would get in the way of what I was seeking.  
That doesn't mean that I would stop seeing a person, but it would allow me to establish realistic expectations for both of us.  

Things that could wait a little longer, like when we are talking committed relationship; infertility, sexual incompatibility, controlled issues (MS, psychiatric treatment)  

To ease my fears, I would want to know that I'm not being deceived and I want to have realistic expectations going forward, level of care expected, fertility, life span.  I might want to meet with the doctor so that I could ask some questions.  I wouldn't expect to go to Dr. visits unless I was being asked to for support.

It didn't teach me shit except how to read, write, and generally communicate. I also played a lot of video games and I'm not sure what they have taught me. Perhaps curiosity and perseverance.

shytemptation,dating_advice,1388773381.0,"I have a feeling that a lot of cheating isn't necessarily planned in advance. Whether they've been cheated on or not, I just don't think most people think to themselves, ""you know what? I want to become a cheater today."" I think it's probably an impulsive thing that happens when an unexpected opportunity arises and the cheater-to-be is craving something new or lacking in the established relationship.

I cheated when I went into the military because I suddenly had lots of hot guys hitting on me and I didn't really know how to say no to guys. I didn't have sex but I ended up making out with some of them. I also wasn't able to see my boyfriend for long stretches of time since we weren't near each other. I always called up my boyfriend in tears the same night that I created because I felt like a horrible person for being unable to control my sexual impulses and every night he forgave me, but it was an unhealthy relationship to begin with so I eventually broke up with him. I had mainly been staying with him in the first place because he raped me and took my virginity and I didn't think anyone would want to marry a non-virgin, so I was also suffering through ptsd and depression at the time.

Cheating isn't necessarily a black and white issue.

I haven't cheated since then, but at this point I just opt for open relationships because I still don't fully know that I could resist the impulse if another opportunity came up like they did in the military. I much prefer being honest and open and guilt-free over the awful feeling of being a cheater. It's also much more enjoyable to me than the stifling two year monogamous marriage I had."

Getting a spot for your car for the night at most KOAs is only 10 dollars.  If you don't mind sleeping in a tent that is very affordable.  I have a nice blow up mat that makes sleeping anywhere pretty comfortable.  I also drive a TDI, and was getting around 50 mpg, so that helped on cost too.

NDaveT,DebateAnAtheist,1388773531.0,"&gt; Really? You are so foolish as to claim oxytocin is the same as love.

Love is what we feel when oxytocin reaches certain parts of our brain, yes.

&gt;&gt; I never claimed it was. Everything in the human experience has a scientific explanation.
&gt;
&gt; way to roll back your words. Wasn't this yours:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Now, you have knowledge about what your personal choices are, but if you want accurate knowledge of what your personal choices are, you use empiricism, just like you do for everything else.

Do you really not see the difference between making a personal judgement and knowing you made that judgement?

The latter is knowledge; the former is not. 

&gt; You very much claimed the only way to know not only about the material world, but about yourself is through empiricism. 

And that is correct.

Are other people restricting what I do? Then I don't have freedom. Do I feel love for someone? If yes, then I have love. If no, then I don't. Does that other person behave in a manner consistent with feeling love for me? Only empiricism can give you an accurate answer to that question.

&gt; Erwin Schrodinger, telling you

&gt;&gt;    Science cannot tell us a word about why music delights us, of why and how an old song can move us to tears.

Schrodinger was wrong: http://www.amazon.com/This-Your-Brain-Music-Obsession/dp/0452288525

&gt; Sure they are, I have to wonder if I have my freedom. I have my love. We ponder those regularly enough.

Yes, and to find out whether you really have them, you use empiricism.

But again, you are talking about abstract human concepts, not something that exists independently of humanity as gods are alleged to do. You are making a category error.

The question of whether you want freedom is a question of desire, not existence.

&gt;&gt;  No, they don't. Buddhism and pantheism both involve beliefs about reality external to human preferences and values.
&gt; Please, outline this, let's have a lol. Especially Pantheism, and Spinoza's god, that is going to be hilarious. While we are at it, please, address Rinzai Zen Buddhism as well. 

Spinoza's god is a deification of the universe. It makes a claim about the universe. It's not a claim about how Spinoza feels about the universe.

Rinzai Zen Buddhism is one of the atheistic variations of Buddhism, and de-emphasizes reincarnation, but does not reject it, so it's still making claims both about external reality and about the existence of souls.

&gt;&gt;  Yes, you do. Something watching over you is something external to you. If it exists, there should be scientific evidence that it does.
&gt;
&gt; Not if it is not a scientific epistemic. That is the whole point. 

The whole point of what? Fooling yourself?

If something is watching over you, then that something would have to exist independently of you. And that means you can use science to determine whether it exists.

If your only evidence for its existence is the feeling you get, then it's a safe bet it doesn't exist outside of your own mind.

&gt; &gt;   No such theism exists. All theistic beliefs posit a god that exists outside of the human mind.
&gt;
&gt;Ah yes, when faced with an argument you can't answer, let's deny it. 

Believing a god exists is the *definition* of theism.

&gt;&gt;Your love is a feeling, not knowledge.
&gt; I know I love my wife. 

Yes, you knowing you love your wife is knowledge, and you use empirical methods to determine if you feel love for your wife. Your feeling of love is not knowledge, it's an emotion.

But this is all irrelevant because you are classifying things that exist only inside human minds (love, justice, freedom) with things that are posited to exist external to and independent of human minds (gods).

roketgirl,gardening,1388773533.0,"Howdy Seattle neighbor! 

The proper time to plant lawns here is going to be late April or early May, depending on our weather and how much sun you get.  Soil temps need to be above 50 degrees.   Throw down your seed and top it with a quarter to half inch of compost, and keep it moist but not dripping, and you'll have a lawn in a few weeks. 

As far as grass varieties, I just go for a mix that doesn't include annual grasses since those will die either in summer drought or in the winter.  Perennials will go dormant and sprout again when the weather suits them.  Just read the small print label on the bag and it will specify the varieties. 

You'll notice most people let their lawns go dormant here in the summer.  It's fine for the lawn once it's established with perennial grasses.  "

What will you do if the only job offer comes in helping big banks foreclose on families in huge amounts of debt?  Or in suing poor people over unpaid credit cards on behalf of the 1%?

How about what I do... I take injured people's grocery money away.  I  help large corporations avoid paying liabilities to their employees, many of whom have been nothing but faithful workers.  I was told two weeks ago that I ""ruined Christmas"" for someone who had done little wrong but get injured on the job.  We're hiring.  How would that sit with your morals?  I enjoy it, but then again, I'm a jerk.

By the time you have enough experience or reputation built up that you can choose to take cases and clients that are ""morally rewarding,"" you won't be able to square those morals with what you've already done without wanting to kill yourself.  Your morals will be discarded like so many law grad resumes at Starbucks.

jglee1236,trees,1388773570.0,"I have an older model MFLB. My buddy just got a new walnut MFLB and my other buddy just got a new PAX and I've used all of them a good bit so I think I can answer this question, lol.

My older (1-2 yrs) MFLB has a slightly underwhelming vapor output. This became apparent when my buddy got his new MFLB and it outperformed my box by, like, 3-fold. I have a warranty claim in to Magic-Flight for this. Now, the Pax is really nice except for a couple negatives. The draw is TIGHT. I guess Ploom advises you to really pack the chamber good 'n' tight for optimum performance, resulting in a tiiiight draw. Also, the cleaning procedure (which can only be done with  the proprietary cleaning instruments) is a bit convoluted. I also heard if you break anything while cleaning it, you're pretty much fucked because you 'didn't follow proper cleaning procedure'. Those two negatives aside, the vapor production is FUCKING IMPRESSIVE. Clouds. Like, you'll wonder how it works so well, that's how much vapor it makes. It outperforms the MFLB here because you can only hit the MFLB so hard before it just starts whipping around the chamber. The Pax negates this problem.

Ok, on to what you're asking about and that's taste. I would put the Pax at 8/10 and the MFLB at 9-10/10. I think this has to do with how each unit works and the way it's designed. The Pax is clearly a more complicated unit in every way the MFLB isn't. There's more pipes and joints and seals for the vapor to travel through. The MFLB is just a hot screen trench and out to your mouth. Also, the Pax is constantly heating until it's turned off (it does turn off by itself after a bit). The MFLB is only on when you're using it. This, I *think*, lets the MFLB have a slightly better, cleaner, more natural vapor. Just my best guess, though. I'm really splitting hairs here.

In conclusion, all-in-all, the new MFLBs seem to be knocking it out of the park. Plentiful vapor production (not quite Pax level, but again, splitting hairs) when hit properly, draw tightness is a non-issue, great tasting vapor. My buddy also got the finishing grinder, which just clips right into the hole over the trench so you grind it right in. And it grinds it like espresso powder. Perfect for MFLB vaping."

[Manga Spoilers](/m ""She even goes as far as to imply that she would cut down Christa during the armored titan chase if she interfered with their attempt to recapture Eren, and coldly declares that she decided long ago what lives she cared about protecting. Yet at the same time, she hesitates to kill Riener and Bertholt when she has the chance... Given all of this, I'm inclined to view her as a more complex character than she's sometimes given credit for being."")


In addition, Mikasa is also just as emotionally impulsive as Eren. She arguably does more to hurt the situation than help it during the standoff with the Garrison over Eren. [Anime Spoilers](/m ""Her attempt to kill the female titan against orders would have resulted in her death were it not for Levi's intervention. Worst of all, she arguably ends any chance at a peaceful resolution to the confrontation with Annie in Stohess when she abruptly decides 'oh, I've had enough' and suddenly draws her swords without orders."")


As for Levi, the most common criticism I've heard is that he utterly fails when it comes to the charisma department. This does nothing to help the Scouting Legion's political ties, and he's outwardly emotionless to the point that he's accused in the anime of lacking basic humanity. He might be a Mary Sue when it comes to combat and the military (and even then it's evident that his teamwork and leadership are somewhat lacking), but as a character, he's far from perfect."

Gpotato,AskReddit,1388773644.0,"There are a few things at play here:

Most teens have grown up with cell phones.  So they have learned a whole different set of values around phones.

If teens of today are anything like I was 15 years ago, they are tuning out their parents or anyone else who is seen as ""judgmental"".  The cell phone is a perfect tool to not only not listen,  but also show that they are not listening.

Lastly, and this is going to sound a bit harsh, teens are not the most [introspective](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/introspection) group.  When combined with a lack of consideration for others this can lead to some behaviors that are offensive to others.

Not that during that period left-wing policies have been widely implemented. In particular:

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1388773871.0,"&gt; I thought it was completely natural to have to work extremely hard at proving your worth to a girl to attract her. 

You actually summed up what I was trying to say much better than myself. But this is exactly the point I was trying to get at. This is why Reddit is so bad at giving advice. In their world, it's just the norm to buy girls flowers, do ridiculously romantic things, to place her on the pedestal. So to these people, like your former self, just think, ""That's how it's done. Every one around me does it that way, and that's what the women are telling me to do. Obviously this is *the* way to go about it.""

Then these guys jump on /r/relationship_advice and start saying shit like, ""You're an asshole if you don't forgive her for cheating on you! She's a women, and she's allowed to explore her sexuality without feeling shamed!"" Then they go back home to their cuckolded relationship. 

&gt; I realized that I meant nothing to her. I was just used. Everything I had done was just to feed her own ego.

Again, this is where the female disconnect comes from. To them, this behavior is normal. To women that have any shred of fuckability, it's just absolutely normal to have guys around to keep you company. That's what guys are for! They are just good friends that like to keep everyone happy! It's like those girls that have a ton of guy friends. They'll always say something like, ""I just like to hang out with guys so much more. They are so nice!"" No bitch, listen, 4/5 of those guys would probably fuck you at the drop of a hat. What you like is the feeling of having orbiters around at all times. The sad part, is you probably don't even know it. And if you do, you'll never admit it. Women are notorious for never being blunt about these things, instead they just [talk between the lines](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1ogpof/women_give_each_other_tips_on_game_and_are_very/)

&gt; Just 3 months on this site has been more helpful to me, than 30 years of listening to women and ""blue pill"" ideas.

Also, talking specifically about LV, look at the detailed descriptions. They're all ""Genuine Leather"" or ""Real Cow Leather"" or other things that indicate sub-par quality. Those aren't good leathers. They're the same cheap shit used to make bags they sell at Wal-mart. LV is an upper-middle-class brand designed to show off.

Do you and your wife have a lot of pictures from your travels? Maybe get a bunch of them framed and arrange them in a way you like. You can get a picture rail too, if hanging them all is a bit intimidating. 

I will say that I do find the placement of the four current pics a bit odd... Generally you want to put pictures at standing eye-level. 

You said there are no built-ins. What's your budget like? Is that something that could be done, maybe?  Not only will it look more ""finished"" it will also give you some nice storage.  If a built-in is not in the budget, a few shelves could be a nice touch that add a bit of extra storage (provided you don't fill them with knick-knacks and other tiny crap lol). 

What about turning that wall into an accent wall? How do you feel about wallpaper? These days, there are soooo many beautiful options that range from traditional, to contemporary, to downright artsy and funky.  Maybe even just a pop of colour on that wall.  Do you collect anything?

Sigh_No_More,buffy,1388774046.0,"Someone answered number 2 already, and although it bugs me a little bit too, that's the right answer. They had to show that the ubervamps were strong and scary, but the finale couldn't just be ""and then everyone died and vampires took over the world. The end."" I really liked the end of the show, and I think it was worth a little bit of fudging the plot to get there.

As for the first question, I don't think anyone actually did know. Buffy realized that the only reason one slayer was called at a time was because of some silly unimportant rule, so it could be changed. They also realized that the scythe was particularly important to the role of the slayer, so if they were going to attempt to call them all at once, it is the obvious catalyst. At that point, Willow was a strong enough witch that she could do magic at ridiculous levels. What she did had likely never been attempted before, and was incredibly dangerous and experimental. They had no idea if she would even be able to do it, much less make it work. So basically, I think they realized that unless they did something really extreme, everyone was going to die and the world was going to end, so attempting it was worth the risk. It was an incredible stroke of luck that everything worked as planned.

I'd drop the Combine. Gaspy really doesn't need the free upkeep and you will never pull off Dark Industries except against a total newbie, whose feelings you will hurt so bad he'll be making (and failing) a CMD check.

Canker I generally like more with pGaspy than eGaspy, but he's an excellent harasser under the right circumstances. I think he's cuttable in favor of a defiler or nightwretch though. 

At 50 points you really want the full Biles. You can't give your opponent the opportunity to shoot them all off the table in a turn, and your ability to protect them will be spread thin with all the other models on the board.

You want a Skarlock.

The Reaper I am actually a fan of under the right circumstances. When hiding behind a forest or clouds he can be a nasty disincentive on control points. 

The Black Ogruns on the other hand, I am not really a huge fan of. The CRA is nice but it feels like it's 6 points just for the drag. At least the reaper can drag and scrap something on the same turn most of the time. If you're trying to pop high-def models, that's what we have biles for. 

The blood witches are an interesting addition I rarely see on the table. It would be really cool to have them pop feat and drag models through them, but your opponent will be altering his position radically knowing you have a couple Drag models on the table, so your ability to snipe anything cool will be extremely limited. More often than not they will probably just smash into a tarpit or some other kind of jamming unit, then die."

xthorgoldx,AskReddit,1388774261.0,"TIL: Vindolin didn't read the full post, or at least is misinterpreting it to a large degree.

Fukushima was a reactor which was *not* designed to be fail*safe*. It used a design built for a flowing-water (aka, not reliant on pumps) reactor from the US and adapted it for coastal use, which introduced a failure state in which total power failure *would* cause a nonsafe failure - no water flow meant that the heat would build due to stagnation of the coolant.

In a properly designed nuclear plant, what happened at Fukushima - the water pumps running out of electricity - is designed not to happen. The reason you get a meltdown in a water-cooled reactor is because the coolant stops flowing. When that happens, the water boils, producing steam, which... is what happens when the reactor is online. WBRs are designed to use this steam from decay heat to indefinitely maintain their own cooling systems: if it's hot enough to be at risk of meltdown, it's hot enough to keep its cooling systems running.

At Fukushima, the earthquake *destroyed* this failsafe and necessitated the use of the power-based generators, which were also damaged to the point of not being able to maintain the reactor. Fukushima wasn't an example of a nuclear reactor going into meltdown because no one was there to stop it, it was an example of why you don't build a goddamn nuclear reactor on a major faultline without building it to withstand those dangers (as I said, Fukushima used a design used in the *American midwest*).

So, to summarize:

1. What happens when the water evaporates? Water will move in to replace it; it's an open system. If the water is *boiling* away due to decay heat, then it will be at a rate that the turbines would be able to provide enough power to maintain the coolant system.

2. If it's hot enough that the zirconium claddings start to burn, you're looking at a scenario in which human intervention interfered with the reactor failsafes - this is what happened at Chernobyl when they removed the control rods, leading to a runaway reaction. If the humans are doing their jobs (or aren't there to do anything), the reactor will *default* into a scram state *long* before you approach meltdown.

3. The diesel generators are redundant; barring major structural damage the reactor will run off of its own power until the reactors are too cold to generate power, at which point they're no longer in danger of meltdown.

4. If this is the scenario, then bringing up Fukushima is *entirely* pointless, since any nuclear reactor that is left unattended has inherent design features that will initiate SCRAM procedures in the event of no human operators - reactors *literally* need someone to push a button every so many hours in order to keep working, if certain measures aren't taken then the reactor will shut itself down safely. If the reactor is shutting down due to an operational emergency, the presence of humans wouldn't change anything in the first place unless the circumstances of the emergency meant that the reactor was damaged to the point of no longer being failsafe.

It's the same as any other fetish. If you find someone who shares that fetish, awesome! But you can only share *that* fetish with one woman once before she is no longer able to satisfy the fetish.

Plus, who wants to believe someone who they love so much is capable of doing this to them? It's a horrific feeling and I could understand why you'd want to avoid that. 


If she's always been honest, and then suddenly is not, something has changed. **Do not** let her twist this into your fault. It is *not* your fault that you've been suspicious. What, are you suppose to just blindly marry this girl while she's off with some other guy? No. It's not like you just randomly snooped because you suddenly got paranoid for no reason. She did things that were suspicious, you asked her about it, her answer raised more flags, and you snooped. Even if you didn't look at her phone I would still assume she's cheating. Why else would she be so secretive and defensive?"

missus_b,TryingForABaby,1388774369.0,"-I eat a little of everything. I love ethnic food of pretty much any variety. We had so little of it when we lived in Montana, so now that we're in Seattle, it's go time! I also love to cook, so we are constantly trying new recipes!

-I wouldn't say my habits have changed too much over the years. I've slowly gotten to eating a bit healthier, eliminating processed foods, refined sugars, etc, but I still cook and bake with real butter, and I'm not sorry about it! ;)

-I think my favorite meal is either dim sum, sushi or pho. Although we did just buy a smoker, so smoked brisket is up there!!

-I take a prenatal and an additional B Complex. I also eat a lot of dark leafy greens on the recommendation of my RE. 

-If I had to eat one thing for the rest of my life, I'd probably pick a bento box with steak teriyaki, shrimp tempura, and a sushi roll (probably a veggie roll because of impending pregnancy and such) with some miso soup! 

-I don't have the recipe in front of me, but my FIL just made Brussels sprouts with cranberries--a combo I'd never have thought of on my own. It was really good!

Most of the Rogues have area-attacks that they can keep active for extended periods. They defend themselves before he ever shows up, and that slows him to a slightly more manageable speed.

It's also important to know that the Rogues have very little ambition. They could be some of the most deadly men in the DCU, but they have a code against unnecessary killing. They're enough of a menace for Flash to fight, but they aren't mass-murderers.

Zygomatico,HomeworkHelp,1388774440.0,"First things first: work on your structure. At the moment you've got an introductory paragraph and two huge blobs of text. I'm not too sure what you're writing, because at first glance it's not clear what you're talking about. Only when you start reading does it start to make sense.

So, what to do instead? A few things. First, break up everything into their individual paragraphs. Write down, in one comprehensive sentence, what you want to do per paragraph. This shouldn't be conjoined, just simple sentences. This will make it clearer to both your reader and yourself what the main points of your paper will be. Every sentence represents a paragraph, so make sure you separate those. Ideally any reader can immediately understand the main points of your paper by just reading the first sentence of every paragraph.

For example, in your first big paragraph you talk about id, superego and ego. I'd split it up into this:

- Golding uses 3 basic archetypes of personality
- Jack represents the id
- Piggy is the superego
- Ralph is ego

You've got the content, now break it up into bite-sized pieces.

Also, organise your information. You go on to mention fire in the second paragraph, mentioning its destructive powers a few times and what it represents. Instead, try organising your information like this:

Men are shown as an unintentional destructive force on the island. This is shown when the children light a fire, representing their attempts at civilisation. The forest, representing the nurturing, maternal side of nature, is burnt down in the process. This shows that the masculine side of society, such as its need for expansion, tends to destroy the feminine side, such as the need to nurture.

The idea is that you only mention every aspect once. It will make your writing much clearer.

That's all I've got. I'm not too well-versed in English literature, but this will at least help the readability of your essay. Good luck!"

He can work as a standalone guardian if and only if the rest of the team has sufficient CC to take care of themselves. Otherwise, he will only be able to watch as his teammates die.

As I said in the guide though, he is still a superb god in Arena, just not as a guardian.

As for Vulcan, reading the comments here has convinced me that he is low B tier, but no more. He might put out damage, I feel as if a lot of it is wasted damage that doesn't help secure kills as much as other magi. Another problem is that there are so many better magi that he really shouldn't be picked above unless it's an experienced Vulcan player. Granted, that could still qualify him as B tier, and I will move him there.

As for Athena's ultimate, it is one of the best peels in the game, and it gives her also something to do while her long cooldowns are down. A simple VAA or VRR in solo queue should remove the problem of low coordination (especially if you have the voice pack).

lingual_panda,Tokyo,1388774555.0,"23 year old woman living in Tokyo. Bring good deodorant. Summers here are miserable. 

Also depending on your body type, it's difficult to find clothes and shoes here. Make sure you have a solid wardrobe for your job. Also a good bra. Women in Tokyo tend to dress more conservatively than American women, plus the body types are different so it's hard to get used to. If you want to dress like Japanese women, find what works for your body type. Don't waste time and money on stuff that doesn't work.

If you are small enough to wear most Japanese sizes, get skirt suits at Aoyama. They're super cute and I wish I could wear them. 

Things that were difficult for me? I went to a very liberal university and I had a great sex life there. Then I moved to Tokyo and had a bunch of weird experiences and it turned me off to dating in Japan basically. Also I found scented toilet paper to be surprisingly common, so certain parts of me were painfully out of commission for about eight months last year. Ymmv with the dating though. 

If you're learning Japanese, commit to it from the beginning. Make time during the week to study before you get swamped by work and life. 

Tokyo is really safe, but don't be stupid. I've been drinking a bunch of times in Shibuya and Roppongi and Kabukicho. If you don't look like a lost puppy, people won't target you. But I don't go out drinking as much as I used to because I hate committing to staying out until 5 am. 

I can't give you much advice on making friends. I suck at it. Some of my coworkers are 20 something foreign women so I'll hang with them occasionally, but I haven't met a lot of people I really feel close to. It doesn't help that I worked 50-60 hours a week at two jobs all last year. My resolution is to get my mojo back, part of which is working less and socializing more. Most foreigners I meet are cool though.

Best of luck, you'll enjoy it. February is really nice in Tokyo. I arrived about a year ago and winter is my favorite season.

Russian_Surrender,relationship_advice,1388774562.0,"&gt; She said stuff like there's so many other girls and why choose this one and do you realize this girl is overweight 

So far, everyone else is saying that this is all about you and your Mom and her worrying about her ""baby growing up"".  

Based upon that part above, I'm going to throw out another idea:  For whatever reason (maybe weight), your Mom thinks you're ""too good"" for this girl.  She may even be worried about what *her* (your mom) friends are going to say to her.  She may be concerned that they'll be thinking ""Poor Billy, always had a fat Mom and now he's dating fat girls"".

If your Mom is a bit fragile, immature and her weight has always bothered her, I think your struggle may be to get your Mom to like this girl.  If she never does, you'll have to deal with that, but it will cause strain in both relationships.

Just to get it on or off the table, I'd just flat-out ask her:  ""Hey Mom, it really seems like you don't like Jane or don't think she is right for me.  Am I reading that right?""  Then see what she says and (hopefully) you can present your perspective to shoot down any shallow reasons Mom has for not liking her."

dmgb,nfl,1388774572.0,"This list is exactly right. Not to mention the number of season ticket holders that didn't order playoff tickets. Because the cost is normally credited to the next season's tickets if the team doesn't make the playoffs, signing up for post-season ticket offers was a no-brainer. But that wasn't offered this season. That paired with the lack of Aaron Rodgers and the doubt that we'd even make it to the playoffs left quite a lot of empty seats. 

A ton of people going to the game this Sunday are first-timers who never had an opportunity to get their hands on a ticket before this at face value. It's really exciting. Hopefully they know what they're doing and give the Pack some great energy. I was at the Vikings and Steelers games this season - the two coldest. And those were brutal.

He gets behind me and then puts his hands under my chest, which caused my center of gravity to go there instead of on my posterior chain, and I failed that set. He then proceeds to tell me how I don't really need to be repping 285 anyway, and that I'll never fight anyone that big (we do BJJ together). I thanked him for the spot, then 5 minutes later knocked out all 9 reps on my own.

Then the next squat session, another friendly dude is there and offers to spot. This time he doesn't put his hands on me, but I get so mentally focused on whether he's going to mess me up that I fail halfway through the set. 

THEN I'm doing a 380 max and I ask a random stranger to spot me, but to only put his hands under the bar and NOT my body. This actually helped out a lot. I didn't earn the 380 without a slight amount of his help, but at least I got stood back up with the weight on me!

Lesson: spot from the bar, not the body. Or, find someone who knows how to properly spot the body."

For the most part men aren't like this. The average guy doesn't have a bunch of chicks fleeing to him once they hear about the break.

pants_guy_,DoesAnybodyElse,1388774766.0,"I don't believe in prophecy or psychics or anything supernatural. However, when I'm pushing myself really hard, being really active and not getting enough sleep, I get these weird thoughts in my head.

The most prominent one only recently ""came true."" In 2005 I started at a new college, and one of the new people I met was a girl who was a friend of friends. We didn't get along. Soon after we met I pictured us driving North in a nice car, listening to techno, wearing formal clothes. This girl was close to hating me, plus I hated techno and fancy clothes, didn't have a nice car and never thought I'd get one-- I don't car about cars.

Years passed and once in a while it would come back. It didn't make any damn sense so I tried to ignore it.

Meanwhile, we left school. We both mellowed out and became friends because we had so many mutual friends. I got a job where I had to wear suits quite often. She moved. I got another job where I had to drive more, and my new job would give me extra money for getting a certain kind of newish, nice car. She got married and I went out to visit her and her husband when I went to their state for work.

Then, a mutual friend was getting married. She flew back into town-- her husband states home because he just got a new job-- and she stayed with some friends who weren't going to the wedding. So she needed a ride.

We got in my car, dressed up for a wedding, and eventually had to drive North. The new Daft Punk album had just come out, and Giorgio was playing on my stereo.

Everything was exactly the way I'd pictured it eight years before. Not wanting to sound like a raving lunatic I turned the music up, didn't tell her about it, and never told anyone about it until now.

Similar things have happened to me before and still do. Coincidences are amazing."

Their website has scant details.

here is whats going on so far:

Maybe its my fault, I'm making assumptions here...
heres what I did
1) went on truecar and got a quote for a base GTI 4 door manual price of $20,006 at a local dealership.

2) I got an email from that dealership that said Retail: $24,790.00 EPrice $21,130.00.
I saw the price difference and was confused so I went to their website because I assumed they didnt have the car I got a quote for and this was the price for one they had.

3) on their site they only had one GTI listed (as new, no used or CPO) and they said
MSRP:$30,760 Web Special Price:$26,812
so honestly I have no idea whats going on exactly but I have sent them an email asking questions. Im assuming this is for the same car and the price they have listed on their website is higher than the email quote.


4) I emailed them back and asked 
""Hi, XXXXX, I'm sorry I missed your call earlier I was putting my son down for bed and couldn't talk.
I noticed a difference in price between the quote from Truecar and the one in your email.  Is the car on your lot a different trim package than the one I had been interested in?
What color do you have available?

Thank you,
XXXXX""


I also asked (in another email) 
Two more questions for you
What is the mileage on the car?
Does this price include all fees? (does it include rebates I might not qualify for as well?)

5) they responded ""Your inquiry came through on a base model with a manual transmission; is that the type of GTI you're looking for? Price quotes do include rebates but not TTL or fees. We do honor True Car pricing on in stock units. Would you have some time to come in and go over numbers?""



So its my understanding that they are a certified truecar dealership and through truecar offered the car to me for a price of $20,006 (though truecars FAQ states it does include fees)...
then they immediately sent me an email with a higher price that doesnt include fees

so I have no idea whats going on.

How should I respond?
I feel like they have given me two prices, dont even know if they have the car, havent responded to my mileage question and want me to go down there already before any of this is sorted out.


So I dont know if they are just completely unorganized or if they have no intention of honoring the truecar price.  (I was under the impression that the certified dealers had to but not everyone else)

So I dont really know whats going on but I dont think im going to go down until I have a better understanding of the situation."

You can be a strong leader and cry or ask questions.  Those actions and emotions can be some of the strongest traits of leadership.  
Should you leave or not is a really tough question.  
Pros, you might be happier  
You'll get a taste of a bigger pond, before you get to college.  
You'll have more opportunities to meet new people/girls  
You'll be able to broaden your horizons.  
Cons  
Leaving would almost certainly alienate your relationship with your parents.  
You may find yourself cut off and on your own (that is a huge leap)  
You might not like different school any more than your current school.  

Personally I would stay, having a parental support system, even a weak one, has enormous value.  
I would also start looking into activities and hobbies that are outside of school and home life.

Middle class recieves basic income. Everyone recieves basic income. Basic income offsets tax burden for the middle class. 

http://pgpf.org/Issues/Taxes/2012/04/041612-tax-rate-explainer

Look at the combined taxes between income and payroll (I'd also have a similar corporate rate, which I don't factor into this, and don't really agree with them factoring it in).

To run their numbers myself:

$16,812 (20th percentile)- -49%

$33,542 (40th)- -4.7%

$59,486 (60th)- 14.7%

$103,465 (80th)- 25.5%

$163,173 (90th)- 30.8%

$210,998 (95th)- 32.9%

$532,613 (99th)- 37.2%

$2,178,886 (99.9th)- 39.3%

So I guess the middle bracket sees a small increase, but keep in mind this is for single earners as well. Married couples recieve 2 basic incomes, so that middle bracket would actually see -10.4%, 4th quintile only pays 11%, 90th percentile pays 21.6%, and so on. "

And I was right that the straw vulca is a bad statement when asking ""is science at odds with all forms of religion in general, and even some forms of theism in particular"". 

That wasn't the question. The question is ""Is there necessarily a trade off between science and all kinds of gods?"" You specifically mentioned a form of Buddhism that doesn't include any gods. 

&gt; &gt; If something is watching over you, then that something would have to exist independently of you. And that means you can use science to determine whether it exists.
&gt; 
&gt; Not if you are not requesting it to be a scientific concept. 

If you claim something is watching over you, you are making a scientific claim, whether you request it or not.

In order for something to watch over you, it has to exist independently of you. That's a scientific claim.

&gt;&gt; Believing a god exists is the definition of theism.
&gt; And that is not perse unscientific, as demonstrated above and acknowledged by you. Wohoo...maybe we are making some progress.

No, you're just lying. Believing a god exists is making a scientific claim. If there's no evidence to back it up, it's an irrational belief.

&gt; &gt; But this is all irrelevant because you are classifying things that exist only inside human minds (love, justice, freedom) with things that are posited to exist external to and independent of human minds (gods).
&gt;
&gt; Again, your strawman, not mine. 

You really don't remember the thread title, do you?

The O-line was solid, and they had no major defensive weaknesses. When we panicked and tried to come back by throwing the ball all over the place, we turned it over and gave the FSU offense more opportunities.

bored_criminologist,Conservative,1388775006.0,"He's just describing the same process using a different name. Consensus in science is results that are verifiable. That's all it means. Consensus builds BECAUSE you can demonstrate it. You and he are conflating scientific consensus with layman consensus. They are not the same and the author is doing a disservice to science by claiming that peer review is not a form of consensus. Peer review is certainly what he is referring to when refers to reproducible results. No one would believe you if told someone you made gold out of sand, but couldn't tell anyone else how you did it and no one else can follow your directions to reproduce the phenomena. Therefore, your statement would not be reproducible and there would be no scientific or peer reviewed consensus on the matter. However, if you showed everyone your models and people reproduced the experiment there would be a scientific consensus that what you said is true.

If your results are verifiable there will be consensus. That's what I mean by scientific consensus and that is what scientists mean when they discuss scientific consensus. If your results aren't reproducible by someone other than yourself using your methods then there will be no building consensus.

Edit: Which is exactly why I went through and talked about Galileo's work. His work is a prime example of how science changes and consensus builds as a result of reproducible research. Call it what you want whether it's consensus, peer review, or verifiability.  It all gets at the same idea of the science being true until you prove it wrong."

And then perform, perform, perform.
Like that game of post office, the more you say the patter, applying it in varied situations, the more the patter almost magically changes and evolves until you make it your own. Think of it like a standup comic. He'll write his routine but will only perform the big theatre shows after testing it out on dozens if not hundreds of audiences in smaller shows, with often unannounced performances.
Once you've reached that point, in the same way you expand your magical repertoire, learning different lifts and cuts, so too will you expand your patter. Experience doing the same trick to a loved grandparent or to an attractive girl you want to impress will lead you down two different routes. Travel both of them. Travel the further splits those routes entail as you meet different people.

SammaSunshine,relationships,1388775114.0,"I can relate, sort of, to your girlfriend. Though I am making the choice to change and work on myself, I understand how she might feel. In my previous relationship, I gained a considerable amount of weight. Partially because of our new relationship we ate out a lot, or I was cooking for him fancy things, then because I was depressed. I am absolutely an emotional eater, I eat when I'm stressed or depressed. My relationship was on the decline, for a lot of other reasons, and I hated my job. And so, I ate.

Eating made me feel better and then immediately worse. I felt like I couldn't control a lot of things in my life, but I could control my eating (even though I couldn't). My boyfriend talking to me about it, even when he was very gentle, hurt very much. It weighed on my mind, nagged at me from the corner where I stored it, but I couldn't figure out how to make myself do something about it. He told me he loved me and was still attracted to me, and we had sex but it definitely affected his level of attraction. 

It sucked because I was uncomfortable with myself physically, and I knew he was too but I wasn't bothered enough to actually do something about it. There isn't much you can say to force her to change her habits. Its something she really needs to come to herself. You can support her and encourage healthy habits but it comes down to her to make the choice. 

Here's the thing though, if she's anything like me: Her eating is a symptom of a larger problem. I ate because of stress, because my relationship was bad and my job was sucking the life out of me. I continued to self destruct until I was out of that relationship and job. Only now am I making strides to better myself. I'm in a new relationship and I definitely wonder why someone like him is in a relationship with me. (emotionally and mentally I know I'm awesome, just not physically). We started Couch to 5K, yoga on the off days from running, and eating Paleo. 

My advice to you is to talk to her about what is bothering her. If she is depressed, what is the cause? I know that when you feel good about your life, you want to take care of yourself. I also know that when I was depressed, I didn't feel like I deserved to feel good, and fed into that by eating the same way as your girlfriend, which then made me feel worse. Talk to her OP, but talk to her about what's eating her, not what she's eating.

BullsLawDan,LawSchool,1388775171.0,"A lawyer, a doctor, and a priest all had a mutual friend.  As the friend lay dying, he said to them, ""Gentlemen, I realize the error of my ways.  You can't take it with you.  I'm going to give you each $40,000 in cash, and I want you to throw it into my coffin, as a warning to others of the futility of material things.""

The friend died, and they went to his funeral.  While the onlookers watched, each man dropped an envelope, obviously stuffed with something, into the coffin.  

After the funeral, they gathered to talk.  First, the priest spoke.  ""Gentlemen, I'm afraid I have a confession to make.  My envelope did not contain the full $40,000.  You see, the orphanage at our church has very worn out beds, and so I took $10,000 of the cash, and bought new mattresses for the orphans.""

After a few moments of silence, the doctor spoke up.  ""Well, as long as we're confessing, Father, I sinned also.  My envelope only contained $20,000.  I used the other $20,000 to buy an MRI machine for the hospital where I work.""

The lawyer gasped.  ""I'm surprised at you two.  This was our dying friend's wish, and you ruined it.  He wanted to do something meaningful with that money, and you disobeyed his very simple request.  I'll have you know that my envelope contained a personal check for the FULL $40,000!""

masterdingo,MensRights,1388775183.0,"During the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese regulars would put punji sticks (sharpened bamboo covered with feces) into holes in the ground. The reason they did this is that it would wound one soldier, and that would require one more soldier to walk them back to base camp. Also, the soldier that stepped on the punji sticks would be out of battle for a considerable amount of time due to the likely infection from the shit on the stick.   
  
Now, since the women will be incapable of lifting a wounded soldier on their own, if the same technique is ever used again, it will take three soldiers off the field if one is wounded.

feedmahfish,politics,1388775186.0,"It depends on your business if you think about it.  Let's think about why you are in a business.  If you want your job to be a business owner, then you run your business as efficiently as possible controlling for all inputs because your income is based on how well you control costs and revenues.  

If paying people $1/hr, supposing no minimum wage, is this a proper business model.

If the price he is willing to pay is $1/hr to add one more unit of cost to his total costs, then it might actually be more fruitful to say, ""I'll not even hire"" and keep his costs low... which makes the situation even worse for the labor supply. 

OR he might say, I need a worker for $1/hr.  Depending on labor laws, this might not be a problem.  We are assuming no minimum wage for this example.  He might just rely on the most unskilled of labor: teens needing job experience... and we got lots of them.  That is, now the employer can discriminate because he has legal grounds to and there will be teens who might want to work for a dollar an hour.  Parents might even be happy for that and say: ""It'll build character"".  

OR  your envisioning happens, he can't employ any workers for more than $1/hr and he needs to have employees he can't afford and the supply pool is more skilled and higher value.  He can't run a business at that point.

So, actually the model really depends on the owner himself/herself.  The business might be run very well and the employer is just cheap.  Perfectly fine.  That's the owner's business and if the supply pool is full of desperate people willing to be paid crap wage, then it ruins the argument of why he is obligated to pay more.  People will still want that wage.

You know how they say if you want to be successful in business, surround yourself with other successful business people. It applies across different social boards. He needs to slowly start disassociating while finding other more likeminded people. 

Like I said in a recent post, what turned me from slightly red pill to blue pill was moving and finding a new group of friends who also happened to be BP. Just by becoming their friends and being around them all the time sort of turned me into a BP. It wasn't until I left yet again and found a more RP group just coincidentally, which increased my SMV tremendously as well as quality of life. Then I found TRP, and everything started to snowball from there.

pomjuice,AskEngineers,1388775191.0,"Wings don't accelerate air over their surfaces - in fact they don't accelerate air at all. Wings create lift by utilizing both the Bernoulli principle (which creates a pressure differential between the upper and lower wing skins) and Newtonian physics (by redirecting air in the opposite direction - downward)


The first thing you need to consider is the type of plane you're thinking of. Many STOL aircraft are propeller driven, especially smaller bush planes. This is due to propellers being more effective at low speeds in comparison to jet engines. 


There are some aircraft that use over wing jets - QSRA, AN-72, YC-14
These aircraft use the Coanda effect, which is (as far as I know) more Newtonian than anything else. Essentially the air wants to stick to the wing, and the wing then redirects the air downwards to create lift. So essentially, the engine is not only enabling increased airspeed over the wing, but also redirecting its exhaust airflow downwards. 


Now consider the structural implications of an overwing engine. The Honda Jet is the only aircraft I know of that has a truly ""over-wing"" design. The QSRA, YC-14, and An-72 all have engines which are essentially built into the wings.
With these engines built into the wings, it allows for STOL via Coanda effect, but in cruise I don't see too much benefit. "

3. if you go through with it, use lots of lube and make sure he wears a condom. **no glove, no love**

4.  remember that shit happens from time to time, so if it's a little messy, it's normal.

5. don't do any drugs before you bottom. no poppers, no trees, no alcohol. drugs deaden your pain receptors and in this case pain is your friend. if it hurts a little, it's probably ok. if it hurts a lot, STOP!

Once he moved up to AAA he cut that down to 29%. That still is very high but I'll take a guy that strikes out that much if he makes it count when he makes contact.

Let me ask you this... you know how it works at 21? I'm just about 23 and have only been in two ""serious"" relationships, and I still have NO idea what all of this stuff means. Your saying ""I know how it works"" could be to your own detriment, and using humility could be the KEY to your own happiness. You're right, age is not ALWAYS a fair factor in measuring one's maturity, but maturity is so so so complex. One can be mature (at a young age) about ONE aspect of relationships, but completely ignorant to loads of others. In my experience, this is how it almost always is. Also, in a lot of ways age IS a defining factor of one's maturity, because how can most people KNOW unless they experience (a *few* times)?

C_Terror,magicTCG,1388775567.0,"It really depends on your meta and at what level of magic you're playing. If it's at a local FNM, you should be fine without the voices (I just came back from a 3-1 with a GW aggro without any voices). Unflinching Courage is your best friend here. Slap that on to a monstrous Fleecemane or a Loxodon, and you're going to poundtown baby.

Personally, I find for GW to really work well without VoR, you need to aggressively pump out value creatures every single turn, and sort of ""overload"" their removals. I run 3-4x Rootborns MB for any wrath removals. 

Someone posted a pretty good deck list below me, but his deck is a little more token heavy and with a higher curve (with the scion of vitughazi).

Mine is more aggro;

**MB**

**1 drop**

4x Experiment Ones (These things usually get to 3/3 and 4/4 each game for me. Their regenerate ability is also awesome against wraths when you don't have any rootborns)

**2 drop**

4x Fleecemanes (Winner winner chicken dinner. 2 for 3 is value, but the monstrosity ends games. Watch out for thinking you're safe attacking alone; I got hit with a celestial flare yesterday)

4x Call of the Conclave (2 for 3 again, and gives our Rootborn/Trostani a target for populate

4x Selesnya Charms (Best utility charm ever. Gets rid of gods, Desecration Demons, big fatties from Gruul (except for dragon), pushing damage through with a pump and trample or saving your creatures, or slapping down a 2/2 post board wipe that's populatable)

**3 drop**

4x Loxodon Smiters (People scoff at the uncounterable, but it's no joke. 3 for 4 is also mad value). Throw an unflinching courage and it's lights out for aggro decks. 

2-3x Boon Satyrs (Their arbor colossus blocking your Wurm? BAM 9/7 Trample to value city baby. Board wipe? Sure, I'll just flash a 3 to cast 4/2 semi haste ready to eat your face)

3-4x Unflinching Courages (This card just... wins. Aggro? Can't outrace a trample lifelink Dumbo/Simba/Earthworm Jim on steroids. Mono B/Esper? Turn your baby Simba into big Simba and laugh at their face. Mono U/ or Azorius? Slap the courage onto a Skylasher or a Mistcutter and watch them weep as you laugh your way past Thassa, MoW, Aetherling. You get the idea)

4x Rootborn (Wraths? No problem. Doomblade? Thanks for another 5/5. How's that for a 2 for 1 value. What's awesome about this card is that you can rush with all your creatures, and next turn when they think they have a clear path and attack, you just say SURPRISE and flash in an **indestructible** 5/5.)

**4 drops**

This is where your deck curves out.

4x Advent of the Wurm (instant 5/5 Trample Token that you can make an army out of. Need I say more?)

2x Trostani (This card depends on your M/U. She's perfect against aggro/mirror/midrange. They have to answer this immediately, or you will win if she's out for more than 2-3 turns)

That's the main board, and it does surprisingly well without the best G/W Card in the block right now. I don't have an Ajani, but I'll swap him in for Trostani or Unflinching, because he is also insane in this deck. 

**SB**

Side board wise, it really doesn't matter, but this is mine for the time being

2x Glare of Heresy (Just used this yesterday in 2nd games against an Elspeth and an Archangel of Thune)

2x Last Breath/Plummets (depending on your meta against either MoWs or their Flyers)

2x Sundering Growth/2x Fade into Antiquity (Again, depends on your meta, but sometimes you just need to get rid of underworld connections asap. I run growths because gods isn't too bad of an issue in my LGS, and the extra populate is always amazing.)

3x Mistcutters/Skylashers (depending on what you have, purely for Mono U and U/W Matchups. Also could work on Esper decks)

2x Bow of Nylea/Spear of Heliod (again, depending on your meta, or just run 2 of each. Each gives value in its on way.

2x God's Willing (Sometimes, our creatures needs that extra insurance when pushing or defending. Scry is also a god send to G/W) 

2x Banisher Priest (This one I'm most iffy about because of the restrictive mana cost. All our creatures lean green (Advent and Boon both have 2G, and E1 is 1G), but sometimes, we just need the removal. Alternatively, 2x pithing needles.

**Edit**

Holy shit, didn't realize I wrote so much. 

TL;DR **You can do fine in G/W without VoR. You just need to find some ways around it**"

animuseternal,Buddhism,1388775649.0,"This may not be quite what you're looking for, but if you want to dive a little deeper into this from a scientific perspective--not a religious one--we can at least make some well-grounded inferences.

First, we recognize that [Dialectic Behavioural Therapy](http://www.priory.com/dbt.htm) is primarily based upon Buddhist meditation techniques and is one of the foremost forms of therapy, especially in the treatment of trauma-based anxiety disorders. There's a slew of research studies you can look into on this.

Second, a large body of scientific research over the course of many decades confirms that meditative practice contributes to enduring physiological changes in the brain and [how emotions are processed](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/11/121112150339.htm), essentially changing you on a biochemical level. Newer research is showing that it goes far beyond that and there is an [immediate effect of meditation on gene expression](http://www.news.wisc.edu/22370) . While this isn't a long-term study, if the practice of mindfulness physically changes the way your body maps affective response on not only a chemical but a genetic level--and that the chemical effects endure over time--then we can safely infer that the long-term effect of meditation would physically change a person to a significant degree over years of practice.

Can we say that a person is capable of completely alleviating all forms of suffering? No, but that isn't exactly what enlightenment is. Enlightenment is being present and mindful at every moment, such that you are aware of changes in your affect and can more readily and easily address these states of mind through examination. We can infer that mindfulness becomes easier over time (a given, but there's a decent body of research on this too).

Therapy protocols like DBT and CBT, across long periods of meta-study/analysis, show extremely low rates of relapse for psychiatric disorders, which suggests that the practice of mindfulness ultimately becomes more internalized and naturalized as a response-mechanism to stressors.

Is this a little easier for you to digest? I'm not exactly sure what you're looking for anymore."

I don't think it would have been necessary to arrest him. I don't even know what that was. 

Which is kind of my point: actual situations in the real world are usually too ambiguous and subject to interpretation to do without the distinction between lawful obnoxiousness and crime, or the distinction between trivially being a jerk and real moral horror. The original linked thread is a TRPer who said he grabbed a woman and made out with her at a party and that she didn't resist. My immediate reaction is admittedly not so much that 'this guy is a creep' as that 'this could mean eighty different things as far as what actually happened.' That's why I think the onus is on the person explaining the concept of consent to the Trper to be clear and charitable, rather than presuming the possibility of rape and raising it, especially in the middle of a giant anti-feminist backlash.

There is layer after layer of technicality in ownership of production and the means of production. One those who study it or are members of the owners class can have useful awareness about it. 

This directly mirrors the opacity of technological use and education. A thousand invisible things happen behind the scenes of every click and page call on the Internet, privy only to those who have paid to see it or are paid to gather it. 

It is difficult for those outside that class of owners and payers to even learn what information is most relevant to learn, let alone actually know it. There is such an over glut of information put there that even the most interested and studious may only stumble upon the really useful information by chance, and even then might not have the resources to understand its value or make proper use of it.

Coachskau,WritingPrompts,1388775845.0,"The shop door burst open, and a small, slim man walked in, exuding an aura of terrifying power.

The shopkeeper smiled pleasantly, surely perturbed by the man, but still willing to make a sale.

The man walked up to the counter, taking off his gilded leather helmet. Boredom oozed from his eyes like pus from a wound. He placed his small bag on the table, rummaged around inside, and produced several dozen identical blades that gleamed wickedly in the store's magelight.

""How much for these?"" he asked, barely a hint of inflection in his rumbling voice. It brought to mind distant, demonic screeches and a faint choir of delicate, beautiful voices.

The shopkeeper looked over the swords, then back up at the man. ""Why, sir, these are all incredibly rare dwarven shortswords, and they appear to be smithied by an absolute master!""

The man sighed, rubbing his eyes. ""Yes, I know. They're also enchanted with all sorts of crazy magic. If you need a sword that lights on fire, I have it. If you want one that can make you fly around in the air, it's in here. Very high-quality. Now, I ask you again; how much for these?""

The shopkeeper gulped, his bladder barely maintaining its grip on his urine. ""I...I...uh, three of these would be worth more than the entire city!"" He looked at the swords again, coveting more than he'd ever coveted before.

The man scratched his head. ""I don't care. How about this: just give me all the gold you have for them and we'll call it square. Oh, and, uh, those potions over there. And these scrolls, here.""

The shopkeeper could not believe this deal. ""Sir, are you certain? I...I'd be more than happy to make that trade, but you could make so much more selling these to the right collector...""

""I don't have time to go look for somebody else to buy these. My house is full of this crap, I'm the richest man in the world. I just want to sell these swords, fight the demon god terrorizing the capitol city, and go home and sleep. But I can't do that with a pile of shitty swords on my bed. So, please, stop talking and buy the damn weapons.""

The shopkeeper nodded quickly, wrote down the transaction in his ledger, then wrapped up all of the items the man had requested in exchange for the beautiful weapons. The shopkeeper had to pinch himself a few times to assure himself that he wasn't dreaming. He could move into a mansion and never work again with the windfall he now had!

The man placed his exchanged goods in his bag, nodded to the shopkeeper, and left.

_____________

That night, as the shopkeeper had the most restful sleep of his life, a shadowy figure cracked the shop's door open. He walked up to an ornate chest, fitted with a lock made by the best locksmith in the land. The man deftly picked it, then propped the chest open, revealing several dozen masterfully crafted, magic-infused dwarven shortswords. He placed all of them in his small bag, then silently crept upstairs to where the shopkeeper lay.

He uncaringly slit the poor man's throat, pilfered what few valuables were in the room, and left.

pistashley_O,delusionalartists,1388775847.0,"What makes me cringe the most isn't the unarguably terrible images ( 4 through 7,ugh,) but the one's that  are *almost* okay but for their lacking forethought or conscious effort or understanding of basic composition and angles.

The biggest miss here is that  they've basically taken trendy portrait compositions and just stuck a plus size  girl in them,  without bothering to adjust the pose or angles to flatter her - heavy bodies can look beautiful,  but the terrible lighting and awkward body shapes just make her skin look dimpled and her limbs look large instead of showing the curves of soft flesh, which could  have been pretty. Like number two: crossing  her arms like that just accentuates the  girth of her waist. In the tree picture, the white shirt makes a large flat plane, which the low ongle seems to exaggerate, and it's making  her head seem tiny and back seem huge by comparison. And the lighting on her arm - my eyes are immediately drawn there, and the skin looks uneven and lumpy, not to mention how the black spine print just exaggerates how much extra flesh there is.

The last one could've  worked for ""body acceptance,"" if they'd skipped all that tacky photoshop crap. Her skin looks nice, and I like the dark shades of her rolls - it's showing a large body as soft, with rolling curves of flesh. Then they had to inexplicably add the gas mask and  that horrid neon on her head.  Uuugh."

masterdingo,MensRights,1388775855.0,"You ever jogged with a 75 lbs rucksack on your shoulders? Have you ever carried someone 200+ lbs while wearing that rucksack? It's not all in the legs.  
  
But, let's take a look at a couple more likely scenarios.  
  
1. Female and male soldiers are in a helicopter. The chopper gets hit and goes down on the side. The male is on the lower side, but unconscious. The female is able to get out of her seat. She's just able to reach the side door. But, if she pulls herself up, she won't be able to reach back far enough to pull the male out. So, she needs to be able to do two things... a) Lift the male over her head and push him up onto the exposed side of the chopper, and  b) pull herself up (in a pull up) to get outside the chopper. And then, carry that 200+ lbs man away from the crash site.  
  
2. A female sniper is out with her female spotter. They are on the back side of a building, and know that there are enemies that they need to recon on the other side. They can't stay at ground level, so they need to shimmy up the back of the building, carrying their rucksacks, so they can spot and radio. This would require three stories of pulling themselves up with almost exclusively upper body strength. If they are unable to accomplish this, then it puts their entire platoon in danger."

A good relationship is a partnership, built on honesty and trust. Not telling a partner about something like rape would only have repercussions down the line, keeping secrets like that is harmful to everyone involved.

ANewMachine615,DepthHub,1388775956.0,"The Appendices to the Return of the King go into great detail over how Tolkien ""translated"" the terms from the Red Book. For instance, Westron was the Common Tongue of the era, which he translates into English. However, many puns didn't carry over from Westron. The easiest example is actually the names of the hobbits. Meriadoc Brandybuck AKA Merry was actually named Kalimac Brandagamba. He changed his name to ""Meriadoc"" because ""Kali,"" the shortening of ""Kalimac,"" meant ""happy"" in Westron. Thus, you preserve the meaning of the nickname by totally changing the name.

Another example is the Brandywine River, which actually had a complicated etymological history. Basically it started out as a pun in Westron based on a mis-hearing of a Sindarin word, and Tolkien was forced to translate it as Brandywine to preserve the joke and the similarity (the name of the river in Sindarin is Baranduin), even though you never knew the source of the joke.

There's a lot more to it. The use of Old English words to represent Rohirric words was meant to convey the cognate-sharing nature of the terms in Westron, as Rohirric was apparently an older tongue with less Sindarin influence. Holbylta, the Rohirric word for hobbits, is actually Old English for ""hole-dwellers,"" while ""Meduseld,"" the name of Theoden's great hall, just means ""mead hall."" These sound a certain way to the English ear, since they are rooted in an ancient form of our modern language, and Tolkien wanted to preserve that feeling that was apparently present between Westron and Rohirric. They're not at all representative of the words actually used in Rohirric."

animuseternal,Buddhism,1388775986.0,"Karma is *not* this Hollywood notion of ""what goes around comes around."" It is a law of causality: that actions cause effects.

Actions and intentions which are harmful poison the mind. If the mind is sufficiently damaged upon death, this determines the state of birth. It does not determine anything else other than how *you* are. The bully might be a bully because his/her mind has been in a negative state for lifetimes. Without greater reflection, the bully may remain a bad person. The bully's actions sow negative karma and make the world a worse place to be.

The five other kids are unfortunate consequences of the bully's karma. Their karmic lineage is not affected by this unless the bullying creates in them a negative state of mind that is not appropriately addressed. Good parenting or a self-reflective nature may prevent this.

tldr; everything you do is karmic, but everything that happens to you is *not* the result of your karmic actions. Your karmic actions affect your mind, which affects your birth."

JordanLeDoux,askscience,1388776023.0,"I am in NO WAY an expert at this field (quantum computing) or its related fields (quantum mechanics, electrical engineering, etc.) However, I have had this question explained to me several times, and I finally feel like I have a handle on how this part works:

Quantum computers have bits that can exist in several states at once, meaning that several discrete answers can be present in the qubits. 

The computers themselves do not actually know the answer, and the quantum system does not either. Instead, what we do is take advantage of the fact that in a quantum system the lowest local energy state is the most likely to be observed (this is probably worded poorly, but please correct me, as I said I am not any sort of expert at quantum mechanics).

The ""magic"" of quantum computers is that we can design ways of ""reading"" that data that will make the correct answer to our question the ""lower energy state"", and thus the much more likely place for the qubits to ""collapse"" to. We do not need to know the answer to our question to design the method of ""reading"" that will cause this to happen, but at the same time it isn't easy, and generally every ""type"" of answer needs it's own specifically designed quantum ""circuit"", where engineers spent a long time figuring out how to make that type of answer the ""lowest energy state"".

But... *after* that has been accomplished, you can take some problems that are insanely hard for normal computers and do them in a single ""read"" operation.

You can kind of, almost, sort of think of it like this:

If you have a bucket of different shapes, and you know your answer is written on all the cube shaped things, then normal computers are like going through the bucket and looking at the shapes one at a time to separate and read the cubes. Quantum computers are like pouring the bucket over a screen that lets everything except the cubes through.

&gt;&gt;If you lot want me to stop linking comments fine, I'll mention how dumb they are without a link and the same thing will happen.

&gt;Sure, do that instead. Personally, I don't know why you need to whine on Twitter about arguments you're having on a completely different site at all. But if you must, do it without the link. Talking about reddit is completely fine, trying to bring in sympathetic people to influence it for you is not.

second: you probably don't have it, or if you did, you probably did not get it from him. still, go get checked for your peace of mind.

ninja edit: if your parents get a bill (possible) it will simply list the clinic or doctor. it won't list what was done. they may ask but you can always say something like ""i was getting a flu shot"" or ""had to get a test for a trip"" if you don't want to tell."

Talk with the rest of the bridal party, it's important to have good communication and cooperation so that everyone is on the same page.  Also involve the parents.  For example its common to have a bachelorette with friends and bridal shower with family.

AMD is pushing the graphics on their APUs pretty hard, which is great for low-end gaming and media-focused systems, but discrete GPUs will still be highly desired. "

As much as I love the way a dark floor anchors a room (especially one with a lot of white) it highlights every crumb, every hair, every dust bunny.  And also just make sure you get a little colour pencil/crayon-type thing that matches your floor colour (a lot of flooring places sell these) so that you can fill in any nicks and scratches that will invariably happen, as those will also be very noticeable in a dark floor. 

My only other concern is that the floor looks to have a bit of a reddish undertone, whereas your wall appears to have a green undertone (I could be totally off-base here as I realise monitors vary greatly). Because these are complimentary colours, I worry that the floor and the walls will kind of compete with each other and perhaps not coordinate as well as they could. "

But let's pause for a moment and believe all the overly liberal discourse, and lead with the premise that filtering the internet is a necessity to protect children, what advantages do you see in the new system of government dictating what is and isn't appropriate; compared to the former parental control offered by browsers/antiviruses/operating systems? Also, why not let the ISP decide what is ""offensive"" and ""degrading""? Maybe some people actually want their kid accessing information about homosexuality but not terrorism.

I don't have a defensible position, my political views are to radical to even try to argue with someone that comes from a position of common sense.

TL;DR from a sociological standpoint: this filter is in line with mainstream internet use, that is why people support it, because the age of 35 year old programmers and 15 year old ""pirates"" is gone, grandma and uncle tony use most of the bandwidth for skyping, (or whatever the old people are calling it these days).

Le_Pyro,ModernMagic,1388776832.0,"Alright so I've been playing some variant of UWR for almost 9 months now and I feel I have a pretty good idea of what works and what doesn't. Here are my thoughts:

* 4 Colonnades is a must, they're just so good for what they do and to play any fewer seems silly. 

* Why are you playing 10 fetches? We have the full 8, there's no need to play any more, we're not combo in that we need to thin our deck out as much as possible, and the additional life loss isn't worth it.

* Pillar and bonfire are not where you want to be, you talk below about how how Geist isn't good because you don't want to tap out turn 3, but what are you gonna do when you draw a bonfire turns 1-4? It's just not good enough. As for Pillar, you want to be able to play pretty much your entire deck at instant speed, so while it does deal with Voice and Finks pretty nicely, it's basically a glorified shock (and that's why you have Paths anyway).

* I really don't think Remand is where you want to be, there's a nice thread right [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1u7fus/modern_gpt_for_gp_richmond_1st/cefd4mf) that discusses it a little more in depth. 

* Thundermaw is also not where you want to be because it means you're tapping out turn 5 (an arguably scarier turn because they have access to more cards and more mana) and you're not fast enough to have dealt ~15 points of damage turns 1-4 to make sure Thundermaw just kills them. While it does laugh at Lingering souls and Vendilion Cliques, the fact that it's Pathable and probably won't just win you the game then and there most of the time means it should probably go. If you want to play a 5 mana dragon Stormbreath is arguably the better choice (as discussed below).

* Where are your Electrolyzes? They're part of what makes the deck so good.

* Sideboard-wise, what are you doing with Turn/Burn and an extra path? T/B is way too expensive to be good, and the Path should arguably be in the main. I never really liked Mindcensor, it always felt too slow to really do much and it's super fragile. I talk a little bit about why I'm not a fan of Stony Silence [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ModernMagic/comments/1u98qr/report_gpt_for_gp_richmond_1st_xpost_from_rspikes/cefuwhr).

blackinthmiddle,politics,1388776845.0,"[From mutual funds that match the S&amp;P 500 Index](http://www.daveramsey.com/article/the-12-reality/lifeandmoney_investing/). Dave Ramsey states 12 percent, but when I say 10%, I'm talking over **any** 30 year period of time. So take any 30 year period of time (including the great depression, 2008 stock crash, dot com bubble burst of '02) and the S&amp;P 500 Index has returned 10% (10.1% last time I checked). I guessing Dave is picking random periods of time. 

Btw, Index funds beat the vast majority of managed funds out there (over 90%). That's because the expense ratio is low since it's an unmanaged fund. Remember, fees eat into your profits, as well as the fees involved with constantly selling funds, known as churning. Now if you want to be extra conservative while doing your retirement calculations, you can reduce the number to 8%, but the market has always born out 10%. If you have 30 years to invest, I'd implore anyone to invest in Index funds that match the S&amp;P 500 Index."

The god responsible for the creation of Mundus and the most powerful entity the Mundus has seen can't really have one of their names be forgotten.

That said, he is pretty much confirmed to have achieved CHIM (Tiber/Cyrus Sword-Meeting), he reenacted the Enantiomorph (activating Numidium, maiming Zurin and killing Wulfharth), mantle Lork (Lork took disagreeing gods and made a planet of mortality, Talos forged unity out of disparity and created an Empire of Man (mortals)), and followed the Second Walking Way (reach heaven by violence, and if Talos wasn't violent then I don't know what is).

CHIM happened before he fought Cyrus in the Sword-Meeting text, Enantiomorph happened at Rimmen, mantling is a drawn-out process, and 2WW was the process of his conquering Tamriel.

Hope that helps."

It's not terribly exciting, but over Christmas my dad gave me a Woolworths (Yes, still going strong here in SA) voucher. I was going to get food and bypass all the lovely clothes and undies (which I needed in quite a panicky manner too), but I stopped at the makeup counters.  
I've been living off hand-me downs and second-hands that don't really match me most of my adult life. The only things I've even bought new were the truly no name stuff that damn near promises a fun case of cancer of the eyelash in your near future. But I gotta hand it to 'em, those half-a-dollar store stuff goes on bright and pretties me all through even a hard working day, so who am I to complain about some future eyelashectomy? They make amazing falsies these days.  

With my voucher, swayed by the fumes of the razzle-dazzle, I splurged. On Woolworths' brand BB cream in a semi-tone darker than I usually wear. It was a *revelation*. It still wasnt *perfect*, but the difference it make both knowing it was a quality cream and a colour closer to what I ought to be wearing... I swear I just sat there at my little battle station- my bed, my box of pretty, an a mirror sticky-ed to the edge of my bookcase- and stared at it.  
I had no idea something so small could make such a noticeable difference. To have a product I bough myself, that actually lifts me out of the uncanny valley (or indeed, the ""She seems to be using liquid paper under her eyes to cover the bags"" effect), it's completely thrown me into high gear for my love of makeup and what it can do artistically AND for your self-confidence.  

TL;DR- Buys Woolworths' brand BB cream, trips balls of epiphanic delight."

It sucks and it's basically like having your teeth pulled the first couple of months, because those are *your* private thoughts and feelings and emotions and why should anyone else care about them? But then you realize that people *do* care about them and want to be supportive of you while you're dealing with them, and it's really fucking nice to just be emotionally honest with someone. I would encourage you to try opening up more, because it's one of the best things I've ever done for myself and I want you (and anyone else struggling with this) to experience it too."

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1388777594.0,"&gt; He has started to put part of the blame onto me for his actions. He says he feels I put the internship before our relationship, so he wanted to see this girl to put himself above me ""for once"". It was a retaliation of sorts.

Even if that's true, why would you want to be with someone like that? He was pissed that you left for a few months to improve your career? I would be a little sad and miss my boyfriend, but retaliation? I mean, you guys have been dating for 3 years, right? So I'm sure you've thought about a future together. Why wouldn't he want you to take steps to improve both of your futures? He loves you selfishly. He doesn't want what's best for you, he just wants the love and affection you can give him. If he truly cared about your feelings, he wouldn't have tried to retaliate and do something that might hurt you. 

&gt; I've asked to see his phone, but he has conveniently deleted all of the texts exchanged between him and the girl.

He's cheated. 

&gt; I wonder if I should cut my losses.

Do it.

&gt;  A part of me really wants to try to forgive him but trusting him seems more and more like a distant hope.

How can you though? First, he shown a blatant disrespect for boundaries. He lies to you. He's hiding things from you. He would much rather take revenge than just figure things out in a peaceful and respectful manor. It's 100% clear that he's cheating on you. I would bet all the money I have on that. 

If he had an emotional affair, came clean, and then actively worked on fixing things it would be different. However, he's trying to play you for a fool. How can he even rationalize what he's doing? The fact that he's trying to hide this from you when it's so obvious shows how smart he thinks you are. Dump. him. He's cheating. If he even cared about you *at all* he would be honest. Or at the very least, the absolute bare minimum, he would stop talking to her without you prompting him to. He wants what he wants. When he doesn't get his way he retaliates. Do not date a guy like that. "
SpaZticHero,xbox360,1388777595.0,"Alright, I've watch the entire video and I've found a few concerns, but I can get into that later, because for the most part, they have nothing to do with Mass Effect 3. (if anyone's want to see it, [here it is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_kQLYEO1qY).)

What this reviewer, and by extent yourself, fail to recognise , is that the multiplayer while helpful, is never necessary in order to help you reach the best ending. (Which, I'd also like to include, is just another potential option. All of the ending are currently considered Canon.) 

The multiplayer is designed to complement the single player experience, not draw focus away from it, and while it does offer microtransaction (something that I agree that, shouldn't be a feature in a €60 game), they're merely accelerators, by which they only speed up the process and give instant access to perks and weapons that would otherwise become unlockable to you as you actually play the game, and to judge a game by this rather than the 25-30 hour campaign, which is the main focus of the game, is extremely narrow minded.

Furthermore, even if ME3 was a complete right off, its not exactly good form to dismiss an entire series just because a sequel didn't meet the standards of its predecessors. Mass Effect 1 and 2 are superbly made RPG, and by refusing to play them due to the perceived poor quality of Three is the same as negating to watch The Godfather Parts I and II because people were upset with Part III.

Give Mass Effect a chance, and when you fall in love with it, come back and give Viva Pinata a chance. You'll love them."

ActingPower,MLPAnalysis,1388777810.0,"Every show jumps the shark eventually. ""You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain."" The question on that count is whether or not FiM has already done it. However, I don't think you can tell that while it's taking place. You have to see it after it's already done.

What I'm trying to say is that the tone is changing. You're right in that I like both the adventure stories and the slice-of-life ones. If I had to make up something, I'd probably say that I enjoy the adventure ones more viscerally, but the slice-of-life ones stand up better under scrutiny. I liked Daring Don't, but Sonic Rainboom does the reversal better. I liked Power Ponies, but Suited for Success explores the characters better. So yes, I do both want to have the cake and eat it. I know, however, that eating it (focusing more on the fantastic/adventurous elements) is not what's best for it, and I'd rather see it remain uneaten.

Let me do this comparison: have you ever seen Survivor? You know how, at the end, the lead guy always ""tallies the votes?"" He rearranges them so that the ending will be as tense as possible. Let's say 13 people are voting. If it's an near-even split between two candidates, he spaces them out; he doesn't just read the seven for one person and leave it at that. On the other hand, if it's 12 votes for one person and one for the other, all he can do is put the other vote first or second, then read the rest in order. The reason why I say this is because all but one of these first few episodes have had these same problems. That speaks to me as though all of the episodes are going to be like that. If they weren't, they would have been spaced out more evenly.

As to tone, I think Digi said it best: five of the seven episodes take place at night. Two are pop-culture heavy. Lots of continuity, and all of the episodes (except the CMC one) had all of the mane 6 standing around doing nothing. (Yes, I know that's copied straight from the article above. Bear with me.) These all speak to a change of tone, from one focused on friendship and magic to one of adventure and fantasy. And while that's okay, I suppose, a thought has struck me: nobody cares about action stories. Sure, they sell big, and they're popular, but in the end, they have no meaning. What matters most is character, not spectacle. That's why the character-driven episodes, not the adventure-y ones, will be the most popular in the end. Because they're the most thought-provoking, the most interesting.

I think that was once one of FiM's greatest strengths: the ability to explore its characters deeply and meaningfully. Again, that's one of those things that we'll have to see where it goes from here on.

Unredeemable to future viewers, I suppose. If people are upset with the current tone, is that just a quirk of the scheduling, or is this a permanent change that will drive some of the viewers off? Because truth be told, I was starting to have doubts around Keep Calm and Flutter On and Games Ponies Play. I'm still watching it, in part because I want to keep up with the show so that the fics make sense, but also because I'm hoping there will still be episodes here and there that engage me. But if the latter doesn't come around, sooner or later the former won't be enough to keep me here either, and I'll do... something with my life. Not totally sure yet. As it stands, I'm starting to feel like something's missing. Like I said, Magic Duel and Wonderbolts Academy hit me in all the right places, but after those two, I've been waiting for a show that hasn't quite come back yet.

And maybe it is that I don't know what I want. But like a child who asks for candy all the time, there's a difference between what I want and what's best for me. And to continue the food analogy, it's the healthy food, the food made to perfection and served with a smile, that's the most filling. I can scream all I want about ""Continuity!"" and ""Exploring Equestria!"" and ""More Fantasy,"" but the truth is that those character-exploring episodes are the ones that really matter. The rest just make me all hyperactive and fat. Or... something. :P"

silly87,AskWomen,1388777995.0,"Whoa! I think there are a lot of misunderstandings going on here.  First,  I don't see how discussing women's issues is an affront to men.  Think of it this way: if it said it was a sub dedicated to discussing LGBT issues or black rights issues,  would you take that as them being against straight people or white people? 

As for female privilege,  I don't think they're saying it doesn't exist,  but that it exists based on the wants of men,  not women often times,  and that it often reinforces harmful gender stereotypes.  For instance, mothers being more highly regarded than fathers probably looks like a clear case of female privilege.  In reality, it reinforces the idea that women are for taking care of children and nothing else.  This kind of thing is what feminism is working against;  and getting rid of the stereotype will help women but also men and children. 

I think you have some misguided ideas about what the patriarchy entails as well.  Feminists believe that while men benefit from it more than women,  men are hurt by it too, and that both men and women contribute to its continuation.  But I can see why the term itself can come off as accusatory towards men. 

As for telling men to shut up and listen,  I sincerely apologize if anyone has acted this way to you.  Many male scholars are feminists and many posters in askfeminists are male.  I have seen some women who think men should be more on the sidelines because men dominate most national conversations and they want a space where people who have had a female experience can dominate.  While I understand their stance, I respectfully disagree (as do many other feminists). Think of it in terms of race though: many black rights activists accept white people who want to work for the same thing,  yet they don't want white people dominating a black rights conversation because white people dominate most conversations.  I hope that makes sense.  Sometimes it's okay to just listen.  But, as I said,  there are many male feminist posters who are treated the same as female posters.  Hate towards men is dowmvoted at the least and deleted and the user banned at the most.

Remember, it might not just be what you're doing either. You don't know how your friends talk about you. Maybe because you're the only female friend, and you relate to them well, their girlfriends feel threatened that you have more in common with their boyfriends than they do? It's probably a combination of a lot of things. The best thing to do really is to try and include her as much as possible. If it's clear on your end that you respect their relationship, and you're not trying to be his number one girl or anything, it will be a lot harder to be jealous.

She said that after the fest shut down for the night and they stopped *only* cleaning trash, they (her volunteer group) started combing the entire festival grounds back and forth and back and forth for hours.

Half of it was to keep eyes open for more trash and valuable belongings. The other half is to make sure that no one is laying completely unconscious and overdosed somewhere or what have you. You never know. They did wind up finding someone pretty passed out in one of the corners of the forest pretty late into the night after everything was closed.

There are a bunch of 'red flag' behaviors that are looked at, basically anything that indicates defects in judgement, stability, reliability, or high-risk, anti-social, irresponsible, or emotionally unstable behavior.  It's not designed to exclude sane people who have had issues in the past and are currently stable with now/low risk of relapse, or people who have conditions under control through therapy/meds (although TS is probably still not going to happen).

Long answer: Not really in a significant way without modifications hardware.

banana-tree,Turkey,1388778240.0,"I was just trying to find out what your actual suggestion was, really. I don't have an answer, not without a reliable judiciary, and we clearly don't have that. I don't like how this investigation was held back until right before the elections, nor do I trust the Gulenist folks to be fair and transparent about it.

But I don't see, even with a perfectly fair judiciary (however that's supposed to be achieved), how your three assertions lead to a sustainable solution. You're saying everyone will inevitably be corrupt. Assuming that's true, we either need to choose to prosecute them when we catch them (and thus stall the projects), or turn a blind eye so they can finish up the projects. If you're suggesting the latter, let's not pretend that that solution respects rule of law. Then we can start thinking about what other consequences that might have, and whether that's worth it (i.e. Where do you draw the line to turning a blind eye? Or do we change the law altogether? When can we start caring about corruption again?). We can't even get there when people claim they respect the law and pretend that that won't stall these big projects (again, if we assume that corruption is inevitable).

There's also the issue of familial connections. If most big projects go to the extended families of the executive branch of the government, when can we say that their prosecution is not a 'judicial coup'? When can we actually start blaming the government for favouritism, and demand that they step down for it? If we can't do any of these, how do we trust the projects to follow certain guidelines so that they don't break down a few years later? How do we make sure that the undertakers are competent if we don't regulate them properly? 

As I said, I don't have an answer if we don't even have a proper judiciary, and we don't. I'm just trying to point out that there's a dilemma in what you're suggesting even if we fix the judiciary branch."
memorulez,battlestations,1388778241.0,"I don't have any person experience with the 600's but I'll try my best here: The 598s have this amazingly spacious and open sound to them while at the same time offering extremely neutral and true audio. By doing this however, the low end can almost be considered lacking by some. I don't have any issues with it, it's definitely still got a nice low end but it's definitely not as pronounced as some of the other cans I own. As far as I know, the HD600s don't quite offer the same sound stage but can produce as much more high-energy sound overall including a driving low end that doesn't overpower the rest of the sound. 

If you're not a basshead you'll be extremely happy with the 598s but if you like to have your brain rattled around then you might be a little disappointed. Personally, I use them mainly for listening classical, folk, country and jazz.

chickennooble,news,1388778241.0,"Whoops, I realized I should have used the term ""contract restructuring"" instead of renegotiated. Even so, when cutting a productive vet like Winfield, you do things that make sure they leave on a high note like:

-Inform them ahead of time of your decision. Let the player and their agent get ready to move around.

-Let them go as earlier rather than later. They get more time on the market and better chances of being picked up. This is the one thing the Vikes did right.

Sex isn't enjoyable because you're not turned on, and to be turned on you need more foreplay than you're getting. Talk to your boyfriend about needing more time to get ready, and maybe explore different kinds of foreplay together (ie certain place on your neck/oral/fingering/breast play/whatever it is). If there are certain things that you already know you really like, encourage him to do those. Also get ahold of some lube if you haven't already.

Basically, making sex good isn't just your responsibility, and this is something your SO needs to be understanding of. If the idea of sex is making you nervous, then try to set aside time to fool around but without any expectation of sex. That might take pressure of off you and allow you to be more turned on. "

Look at [this person's Deviantart gallery](http://doubleleaf.deviantart.com/gallery/) for more examples of sexualized men. 

The Witcher is a good example of a game like that that I recently started playing. Triss's portrayal kind of made me facepalm a bit. Here's this supposedly really powerful magic user, and she's the one who gets instantly rendered useless by the evil wizard guy. That's not to mention her clothing design. 

GTAV is another one. I haven't played it myself, though, just watched a bunch of gameplay videos, but the portrayal of men and women are definitely VERY different.

TBWolf,AskReddit,1388778342.0,"Thankfully people like you don't run the world, or I bet we'd have very little choices.

Since we're using political stances as ad-hominem, ""You pro-life people"" seem to forget that if you take away clinical abortions, people WILL resort to coathangers or other things, and they WILL die from it. This has been proven to be the case in the past, people will do unhealthy things to their body to try to get the baby out, and many will seriously injure or kill themselves, like has happened in the past.

What pro-life people SHOULD do is encourage people to not get abortions by opening up a service that helps pay for births that mothers can't afford, and encouraging people to have the baby and give it up for adoption, if there's no risk to themselves or the child.

Instead, you guys try to take away everyone else's rights due to YOUR opinion(And typically/statistically, people who are pro-life also tend to be against gay marriage. Nice trend going on there). That's pretty fucked up.

I don't ever foresee myself ever wanting my wife of the future or girlfriend even if it was accidental to get an abortion, but I will respect her wishes on it because she is the pregnant one, not me.

If a woman wants to carry to term and give a baby up for adoption? So be it, that's their choice.

If a woman doesn't want to deal with being pregnant and having to withdraw from work, staying home a lot, being physically inactive, and many other things that come along with pregnancy? Then so be it as well.

I think that only women who have birthed a child should have the right to be pro-life, otherwise, people need to shut the fuck up.

Also, Das_Mime makes a distinction where one is not warranted between the Silmarillion and the other books. The Red Book had 3 main sections: Bilbo's *Translations from the Elvish*, which was Bilbo's translation of the *Silmarillion* into Westron; Bilbo's *There and Back Again* which became the Hobbit; and Bilbo, Frodo, and sam's *The Downfall of the Lord of the Rings and the Return of the King* which became LOTR.

I read a fantastic Cracked article once that said something along the lines of, ""You can say you care about the homeless people all day, even say that they are in your thoughts. But what are you doing to SHOW that you care? Are you volunteering at shelters? Soup Kitchens? Because *that* is what really matters."" The article was basically saying that the reason most people feel unfulfilled is because they don't DO anything about what they want and how they are feeling, and this was used as an example.

As for your specific situation.... why would it be so bad if she was already in love with you, considering your points so far? "

Some people can have no concrete evidence and still believe. On the other hand, some people can be shown the truth and still not believe. I can reel off the big list of scientific/historic evidence I have considered in my choosing to believe that a man rose from the dead 2000 years ago, but at the end of it all it's not going to convince some people.

TheLittleGoodWolf,TheLastAirbender,1388778702.0,"Kinda want to share my views on some of these points, for my own amusement.

The good:

About Mako, take a look through season one again and you'll notice that he's pretty much the voice of reason there as well. Sure he gets into the whole love triangle stuff but that's confusion and emotion and whatnot. Imagine if you had the affections of both Asami and Korra in a situation like that, not easy. He tries to focus on what's important leaving the relationships aside. Sure it doesn't excuse some bad choices but it does explain them. After watching season 2 a rewatching season 1 Bolin actually became a bit more of the bad guy IMO, and I love Bolin.

No comment on the rest, I fully agree, though Varrik was my favorite character. 

The bad:

About Lin. Somehow this never really bothered me. She took a back seat and that's a shame but I can get over that. I think we kinda got a Jesus complex about her from the first season on the count of her being so fucking badass and no nonsense all the time. Still republic city is a place of laws, rules, and politics, and she is required to follow them in order to maintain her job as well as possible. Just because the two token idiot detectives are just that it doesn't mean she has to notice it or even have time to notice it. She's got a lot on her plate and just because she ""knows"" Mako didn't do it, that doesn't give her the right to free him with no evidence. Bit sad to see her as the stereotypical police chief but I don't see why she can't be both. There just wasn't room for her awesomeness in this season (it would outshine all the others).

Korra: There was no real fallout from season one, I still think it would have been awesome if they began the season with her amnesia and had the beginning as a flashback. Perhaps someone will do a re-cut of the season...

The love triangle: yeah, fully agree... fuck that noise. ^^^^^^korrasami ^^^^^^for ^^^^^^life!

The pacing and the villain: Yeah, the pacing did feel really off a bit too often for me. I kind of liked ""the sting"" in a way, but it could have been executed a lot better. They should have gone full CSI over the top with it IMO. Unalaq could have been sooo much better, but I'll  take what I can get. Somehow I prefer the ""mover"" version of him. Vaatu was badass darkness, and Varrik was awesome as the lovable scumbag.

Ending: I like the rebooted avatar actually, it was a great way to continue the franchise without damaging TLA in the process. They finalized it here with the actual execution of all the past avatars and I think it was great. Incredibly sad and upsetting but ultimately a good move IMO. I love how this is represented in Tenzin meeting Aang and their talk. Cliffhanger is a bit bothering but that's what they are for, I want to see what happens next, and that's what season 3 and 4 is for. Had it been the end of a series I would be furious though.

Eska and Bolin: Phew! I actually loved what they did with their relationship in the end and I didn't think I would at all. Sure Eska was a slightly fun character but waaay to abusive for my tastes and her portrayed likability (personal issues there that color my emotions of it all).

In the end I would like to see season 2 re-cut, because all the great elements are there but in the wrong order and wrong pacing. Also I miss the actual ""over the top"" of pretty much everything in this season. Had ""the sting"" been more of a parody of an action cop movie with all that entails, and Unalaq actually been more like his ""mover"" portrayal, etc I think I would have liked it much more. Still liked it a whole lot though."

Yes, the dedication, persistence and ambition necessary to achieve anything in the bodybuilding world is still admirable, but *all of that is completely overshadowed by the rampant use of illegal drugs*.

I'd like to clarify regarding public service buildings like arenas and event-type builds (edit: and player-built clan halls, etc.), the idea I was attempting to express is that Minecraft is a building game and survival mode is no exception, and if players wish to have something that doesn't yet exist in the map they have the power - particularly if they work together like we did during this meeting - to create it on the server directly. They don't necessarily have to have protections, and creating something of value to other players is not a power relegated to moderators and admins alone.

Take a look at the PvE server for example: people create dungeons and mazes and KOTH arenas and all sorts of things to improve the quality of the server for nothing but the desire to create fun for themselves and others (I offer Wonderland as an example). Rail lines are created by regular players bringing convenient travel and community projects are common. This may be helped by the fact that the server culture on P is not bogged down with conflict and frustration, but I believe the same basic spirit can exist on S as well. Not the idea of making everyone into communist carebears, but to stimulate a culture in which survival and PvP are more enjoyable and facilitating a stronger more engaged *community*.

Though if players build such things in creative mode and submit it to the mods/admins, that would still be better than no build at all in my opinion.

---

Not included in these notes is a brief discussion regarding automatic-roll-back grief protections. Bhrossman was mentioning a particular plugin that would allow players to break blocks and they would not drop as items. I would be interested in learning more about this plugin.

I think it would be nice to have a setup where you have your build ""protected"" such that gameplay on S is like normal, the rules regarding griefing are the same, you can break blocks to gain entrance but they must be replaced. If they aren't replaced after a period of time, 10 minutes, an hour, a day, etc. they're rolled back automatically, and either the moderators receive a notification or the player whose build it is is sent a notification. From there the grief is treated like normal, except moderators don't have to manually revert the changes, and modreqs don't fill up the queue. What's more, this handles grief that isn't detected if the player is working on more than one build on the map - particularly very large builds.

It might be a technical nightmare, or it might not be. We have regions on P and people get along with it fine, but it may be too big of a change.

During the meeting this idea was met with some opposition. LadyRavenOwl suggested that if you build near spawn and are getting griefed regularly, then you have signed up for it by building near spawn, and you should have to modreq each time. To me this seems to imply that the grief you experience is justly earned. I don't think bestowing grief is ever acceptable, and I'm not certain I fully understand this particular argument. I'd like to hear clarification.

Others mentioned that such a setup would allow duping of items. It seems like this idea was discussed in a Survival suggestion thread a while back, i think one that Uni0 posted, and a solution was proposed - I could be remembering incorrectly. It seems like i recall it being expressed that such a setup would discourage PvP but I'm not sure how - I could be remembering incorrectly, haven't yet found the spot in the recording where it was discussed.

---

The idea of non-pvp zones in cities was brought up by DingleDork. I understand this is something that was set up before P.nerd.nu was created. I know it didn't work in the past, and I believe that new developments in server plugins have the capability to allow this to work better than in the past. I'll see if i can find the old thread in the forums where a possible working solution was offered. I know many people bristle their fur at this idea, so it would need a lot of consideration and thought. I don't mean to suggest it should be implemented as soon as it is (if it is) found to be feasible, merely that it *deserves* consideration.

---

Regarding spawn rates and ender pearl damage and saturation and other changes to vanilla minecraft features (including the ideas I've offered support for): What we're discussing here is changing features in vanilla gameplay. We're talking about modifying the game to suit a particular preference. We should be *very* mindful of how such modifications will affect players who may have different preferences, and how we present ourselves as a server - e.g. the more modifications we introduce, the less we can claim to be vanilla. The easier we make it to get protIV dia and regen pots and whatnot, the closer we are to being a Kit server. I know it was only briefly mentioned in the meeting, but there are a fair amount of people on S who do not play there primarily for PvP. This might be mind-blowing for many of you, but it's true. With ever more emphasis on PvP and kill-death-ratios and clans and whatnot, this segment of the community does grow smaller. Maybe they're just in the wrong place to begin with, but we do view Survival as survival with PvP enabled, not PvP.nerd.nu. When making decisions about server changes, I ask you to please take this segment of the community into consideration.

---

I'm very appreciative of this meeting. I'd like to offer the idea that not all who play on the server were present, or were necessarily aware of the meeting considering the short notice. Any changes made as a consequence of the discussion should bear in mind that attendance did not necessarily compose the full player base. We may not necessarily run on democracy as a rule, but all voices deserve to be at least heard. Take time before making changes.

Dajbman22,AskMen,1388779024.0,"I personally love making lots of eye contact. Seeing my partner look longingly back at me (especaially looking up at me during a BJ) really drives me wild.

That being said, we need diffrent strokes for different folks. Sounds like your BF just really likes to go into his own little world while getting off. Some guys like to just focus on the sensation and looking up/closing his eyes is one way he can really focus. I highly doubt it is because he thinks you have an unattractive face and finds it distracting.

If it would increase your pleasure for him to look at you more, tell him. Let him know eye contact and looking at each other really get you going. He doesn't have to give you a 1000 yard stare deep into your pupils the entire time, but if it makes you feel better, there is nothing wrong with asking him to look you in the face every now and then.

slangwitch,relationships,1388779057.0,"Try to encourage her to do weightlifting and body weight resistance exercises (rather than cardio) while balancing her diet and counting calories. Weightlifting is easier to get into than cardio for obese people and building muscles helps to burn calories. Once she is back in the overweight range cardio will become a more viable addition to her routine for weight loss.  

You also are a great resource on this as it sounds like you have been involved in that weight lifting scene for a while now. See if you can get a specialized trainer through your contacts who understands the needs someone like her has for a sustainable program at a pace she can handle, not one of those crazy people who makes a person hop up and down 500 times until they have a heart attack. You want to find something that she can succeed in, not something that will be super painful and therefore a one time thing. 

I also think outdoor exercises like biking are great in that you can set a location as a goal and prevent yourself from wussing out halfway through as you might on a machine. Its also a bit like mixing weights and cardio. She can use podcasts or audio books to prevent boredom during these exercises. That fast became a highlight of my day when I really got into it.

Ultimately, she can't expect to become obese and remain sexually attractive to someone who developed their attraction to her during a much lower weight phase. She can be upset, but it just is the case and your expectations don't seem unreasonable. "

They humanize Jesus, instead of placing him on a pedestal of idolatry. The teachings of Jesus in the Gnostic Gospels are incredibly interesting.

Follow these steps:

* Decide on how important the website is to you. How long can it be down before you lose money? How much would it cost you if it were to go down?
* Decide on a budget that you can afford. The minimum is about $30/month -- but expect problems and poor service.
* Choose a *registrar*. A registrar is what you use to register a domain name. It'll offer you all kinds of upsells, the only one you should consider is a privacy option. Without that, people will be able to find out what address/phone number you registered with. Not really a big difference in registrars, going cheap is OK.
* Choose a host. Do **NOT** use the registrar up sell. It'll be cheap and also the stuff of your nightmares. (See hosting below)
* Choose a webdev. They can charge either by the hour or by the project. By the project is more typical, and can range from $300 for a simple wordpress site to over $5000 for a simple custom site. Wordpress sites all look similar, custom sites are just that; more to your tastes.
* For email, I recommend google apps. Its cost is $5 per user per month. However, if you are dealing with something SUPER secure, like patient records or high technology, you should roll your own. 

That's the gist of things!

Here are some terms you'll encounter:

* shared hosting -- cheaper than VPS, but you are on a server with lots of other people. That means it's both less secure and more prone to problems. 
* VPS -- virtual private server. This is what I sell, along with my consulting for startups and established websites.
* Dedicated server/colocated server. This is also what I sell, it's the most expensive. You have to buy or lease hardware and put it in a datacenter at a monthly cost. There are only a few instances where this is a better option then VPS.
* SEO -- search engine optimization. A lot of it is snakeoil, and most web development companies do basic SEO ingrained. Advanced SEO stuff costs money per month, usually around $300+. It also requires copy to be written on a regular basis.
* ISP -- internet service provider. It is similar to hosting, and it can overlap with the hosting company. It can also be different. 
* Managed (hosting, VPS, dedicated server) it's an add on service for your hosting solution. It means technical staff will take care of your stuff for you.

Finally did it when they tried to get me to buy them a car using my credit because they didn't want to accept that they needed to drop a notch in lifestyle.  The conversation went similar to this:

""You don't trust us to make payments?  You don't trust your own parents?"" they had said.

""NO.  You have done nothing but prove that you are incapable of taking care of yourselves and I won't carry the burden because I can't and it's not my job.  You are two grown up people and need to take care of your shit,"" I snapped back.  The sense of relief was incredible I have to say.  ""Your child should not have to be more responsible than you.""

""After all we've done to raise you,"" they attempted to mount a defense.

""I appreciate the childhood you gave me, but I am not going to pay back that debt by ruining my future.  That would make me an irresponsible adult which is not what you tried and failed to teach me.  I do not owe you my future and nothing you say is going to change how I feel or make that any less true.  For you to EVEN THINK THAT is selfish and I am not going to have that,"" I said.



Convo went on for a little longer.  I stayed stone-faced and rock solid on point.  They eventually gave up and I ghost-walked out of there.

How do you deal with fleas?  Realize that they will be there for a while.  I'm mostly okay, but I still do from time to time, mostly in the form of fear - the fear that I will fail and end up like them.  When it comes down to it, it's a day to day battle that you choose to fight and struggle to win.  Celebrate the daily victories.  I constantly remind myself that I am like them in some ways, but I am not them.  I will not make their mistakes, I will do better because I know and understand and am willing to admit.  I remind myself every single day that I have flaws and that these are things I need to work with and accept.

Some days are better than others.  That's how it starts.  Then you find your stride, and everyday gets better."

The best analysis I've seen comes from [Lawfareblog](http://www.lawfareblog.com/2011/12/ndaa-faq-a-guide-for-the-perplexed/). Note that the post is from 2011, but the language of the detention sections hasn't changed since that post (which addressed the 2012 NDAA). Relevant section:

&gt;**Does the NDAA authorize the indefinite detention of citizens?** No, though it does not foreclose the possibility either. Congress ultimately included language in the NDAA expressly designed to leave this question untouched–that is, governed by pre-existing law, which as we explain below is unsettled on this question.

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1388779231.0,"When we say it, we mean women are incapable of the same kind of love men have. We love each other in different ways. Often, men just assume women love us the same way we love them, but that's not true. Our love is entirely different, which causes a lot of men to get really burned.

For instance, men are disposable. When we commit to a woman, we are basically saying you and I are now a team. I am willing to take bullets for you. I will be the last off a sinking ship. I will fight wars for you. I will pay for you. I will do everything in my life dedicated to you and our child.

Women, generally do not have that kind of love for their man. She may care for him a lot, and genuinely feel connected, but she will never have the same type of love we are capable of. She may think she has it, when she's knee deep in lust and infatuation, but she has no problem swinging branches when something better willing to commit comes around. Men tend to stick by their women through thick and thin, just as long as he can trust her and she fulfills her duties as the wife of the man willing to die for her. But for women, she's willing to leave just as long as the relationship hits the rocks and a guy who is objectively better in every way comes offering her more. 

For instance, say some stud Hollywood actor came around that you felt a genuinely lustfully infatuated with. You think he also cares for you a lot, and now have the potential to have a wealthy life, with a fun guy connect with, and travel the world! Many women, regardless of what they admit, will be willing to do this. It happens on a daily basis it's almost sickening. Men on the other hand, presented with a similar opportunity are a lot less likely to go branch swinging. They don't want to ruin the relationship with the girl whom they've dedicated their mortality to. There is a reason 75% of divorces are initiated by women. When men divorce, it's generally not because he thinks he can branch swing over something better, but because she's failed to fulfill her role as the wife. She stops caring about him, get's selfish, gains weight, and just generally is no longer his wife. 

Hence the reason we teach men the women are not capable of love. It's safer to just understand that too many guys are investing too much of themselves into women who likely wont return the same type of favor. Play it safe, spin plates, and take it slow before getting into a LTR. Don't follow your instinct which is to give her everything and treat her like the woman you're willing to die for. She won't respect you for that. Women are very selfish and they will just take advantage and walk all over you. Today's society's women no longer appreciate and respect male disposability and how difficult it is to always be fighting to be the top 20% both socially and economically. So if they aren't going to pay us that respect, why should we pay them any respect? Many men are choosing to go their own way now because they simply don't see the system as fair -- It's just not worth it. 

You may be thinking, ""Yeah but men you don't NEED to act this way. You don't have to jump bullets and go to war for us."" Well, I don't think most women would like it if men stopped being disposable, but that's besides the point. Men want to be this way. We want to be winners and fighters. It's in our genes from hormones to brain structure. It's why so many little boys want to be super heroes. But like I said, times are changing. Men are being told to repress these urges and play by the rules the women are setting up. Feel how they tell you to feel. And it's BS.

positmylife,IAmA,1388779276.0,"I would tell you to read up on both disorders, but it might make you more worried than you already are. Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder while schizophrenia is not. It's more common that if you have a mood disorder in your family history, you'll be at risk for another mood disorder yourself. When you really think about it, mental disorders are not unlike physical diseases. If you have heart disease in your family history, that doesn't make you at risk for breast cancer unless that is also in your family history. Just because someone in your family has a mood disorder doesn't make you at risk for all f the mental disorders. You do need to be cautious if you are ever diagnosed with depression however, as some medications could cause someone with depression to swing manic if there is a genetic predisposition for bipolar disorder present. 

Hopefully this will put your mind at ease a little. You really should look into relaxation and stress relieving practices. Schizophrenia often comes on in the late teens/early 20s because that's a pretty stressful time in life. While we don't know how to prevent the onset of mental illness, a good rule of thumb is to just take care of your body. Practice using reason to work through irrational fears. If you're that anxious about developing a mental disorder, talk to a counselor. A counselors job is to teach you behaviors and give you the tools to deal with issues in a healthy manner. In the end, you have to realize your fears are doing you more harm than good and you need to work on getting those under control. It's easier said than done, but it's worth the effort. I used to get super anxious about a lot of things but I've learned to control that fear response and it's made life so much better."

I have had tenants online bill pay to my home before, but even then, I still have to go cash a check, which takes time to clear, and can also bounce.  Also, when I have cashed out accounts from services such as Scottrade, I have always received a check to my house, not to my bank.

You are assuming a tenant has to first buy Bitcoin before sending each month.  What if the bulk of my tenants financial assets were in Bitcoin?  What if they had to convert to USD before paying?  What if the price of BTC rose relative to USD after they sold?  What if it takes 5 days for coinbase to convert their BTC to USD?  If rent is in BTC, then how do I, as a landlord, ensure I am getting fair market value if the price relative to USD changes daily?

If you work off the assumption that the Tenant has Bitcoin and doesn't have to convert USD to BTC each month, then accepting payments in BTC makes sense.  "

As I'm walking back, I see my phone is gone and a kid sneaking behind the rack next to where I was set up. Walked over to him and said ""do you have my phone?"" He says nothing, pulls it out of his pocket, hands it to me, and goes over to his parents. I was furious. I'm not a big guy, but I wanted to beat the tar out of this kid.

Fast-forward 10 minutes and I decide to say something to his parents. Walk over and ask them if the guy was with them. They indicate yes. I tell them he needs to not touch other people's property, and they respond with ""no habla ingles."" (This is in Texas).

Westminster determines foreign policy, monetary policy, and shares the resources of the whole of the UK over the whole of the UK. Scotland handles how it divvies up its share of the pie itself.

One interesting tidbit about the North Sea Oil is that, if divided along a line stretching out from the border (as is the U.N. standard), England actually owns the majority of the UK's share (as the border [runs SW-NE](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Anglo-Scottish.border.modern.png)). It's only with the unusual (but unlikely to be overturned now) North/South division that Scotland becomes an oil-rich nation.

That said, there's no real argument *against* Scotland becoming an independent nation if it so desires, provided that it honours its treaties, including the 2% GDP defence spending required by NATO - we already have enough free riders from the Continent, thank you."

Abortion should be legal until that point (i.e. the entire first and second trimesters) since some women can go months without noticing due to denial, already irregular periods, and lack of education. 

I don't think that abortion should be used as contraception. Considering that's not even the definition of ""contraception"". Conception happened when abortion is needed. Now, education about birth control and better access to both hormonal and barrier methods will greatly eradicate the need for abortion. These folks had a slip-up for whatever reason.

min lösning var att börja gymma tills jag nu kan ha på mig 34-35 midja, som är mycket vanligare (även om 34 längd är ofta det bästa jag kan hoppas på, går att lösa med lite smyghäng så det inte syns så mycket)

You're okay joking about it because you're viewing this celebratory as not a real person. Actually encountering said person and sleeping with them makes them go from a fantasy to reality. Unless they made it *very clear* that this was okay, and not some, ""It would be cool if this could happen but it never would in a million years"" type thing, it's cheating. 

Theres a difference between fantasizing/joking about something that will never happen, and setting clear cut boundaries on it. When you talk about celebrities, the majority of people aren't talking about real boundaries because it's not something most people will ever have to worry about. "

I assume you mean the sense of lightness you get when you remove ankle weights after you've had them on for a while.  I also assume that you're asking about how to make that feeling of lightness linger for longer.

The short answer is that you can't, really.  Your body is very good at getting used to stimuli, and when stimuli to which it is accustomed are removed, there is some temporary reorientation, but again, your body is very good at getting used to this new state as well.  You can make some slight duration improvements by having heavier weights (though it is best to spread these weights out, e.g. knee weights, thigh weights, waist weights, etc.) on for longer before removing them, but it still won't last incredibly long."

But she also said that not much really happens with it. So I think in the next movie it'll be more about her kicking ass and less of her watching a little dwarf one. 

Edit: Should also add that Evangeline often describes Tauriel as a little bit reckless because she is so young and desires to do so much more, so I feel like there isn't so much *romance* but *compassion* for the dwarf that inspired her to defy her orders and do what she wants. "

doomrabbit,TheWire,1388779910.0,"I taught at he collegiate level, and one of my classes was an advanced placement which had local high schoolers bussed to my classroom. I know Prezbo's feeling the moment the class turned on him. It's real.

Normally, the inner city kids made up 2-3 of the 15 slots, a fair representation of their percentage of the districts pulled from. All were well behaved. Reminded me of Dukie. A little rough around the edges, but polite and eager to learn. You knew they had issues, but the joy of learning was doing something for them. Very rewarding.

And one year that school got massive federal funding, 2-3x normal, to ""turn things around"". Half the class was from the ghetto that year. The dynamic flipped, and hard.

No respect from the first minute, talked over me constantly, had a ringleader drawing in the interested ones and turning them. Must have had political connections somehow, because even with complaints and it being a class where I was supposed to be able to kick bad apples, I couldn't shake this the troublemaker. 

Normally the class formed a strong camaraderie, as the district kept them there for the whole morning, but they really only needed every other day if that for the coursework. There was plenty of downtime for them to socialize. Not this year. Near fights, self segregated sides of the classroom. 

Finally kicked out one student who had only attended day one, got a replacement from the district. She was gifted and blazed through the work, instant grasped it, made up two weeks in days, and didn't join in the class derailing. And four weeks in the school district found out she was pregnant and kicked her out. My one saving grace, the one student I was making a difference for, who might learn a valid skill and go on to have a career - gone. But the ringleader attended faithfully, oh joy.

And these were supposed to be the best and brightest and I had no budget issues. That was the year I lost what little faith I had still in public education.

TL;DR; I am even more whitebread than Prezbo. The idea of keeping the bad apples out of the classroom is real and it works."

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388779990.0,"&gt;Thing about that movie is that it's... refreshing. I can't express it rightly, but when something like that is important to you, when something like that matters, it just means a lot. 

In that case, you should check out [Barbarian Queen II](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBFH9qwibhk), [Amazons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6VNYggfs_A), [Phoenix the Warrior](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ_4NP2Kvjw) (aka She-Wolves of the Wasteland) and [The Sisterhood](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJBG0voe4Io) (just the trailer, can't find the whole movie).

&gt;But I think the fact that you had to dig so darn deep to find a movie that passes the Bechdel Test proves my point that feminism is still required.

I didn't have to dig deep to find a movie that passes the Bechdel Test.  I could rattle off dozens of movies that pass it, pretty much every new release I've seen in the last few years.  Maybe not Djano Unchained.

No, I had to dig deep to find a movie that both passes the Bechdel Test **and** is cartoonishly sexist.  And that's mostly because they stopped making those kinds of movies back in the early 90s, when the tax codes were changed and you could no longer use movies as tax shelters (which is why there was a massive explosion of low-budget fantasy and sci-fi movies in the 80s).

Yeah, finding a movie that passes the test is easy.  Finding a movie that clearly sexist made recently? Now that's hard.

&gt;Because women are still not being treated as having their own agency, they are still not being represented as something else besides validation for a man, they aren't human but objects to further the plot or romantic interests.

That's completely untrue.  It's easy to find stories where women are the protagonist and have agency and are the focus of the story.  The problem is that most stories about women protagonists are romances, and thus the woman's pursuit of romantic goals becomes the central plot of the story, and since dialog naturally focuses on plot (if the writer is any good), and since most romances are heterosexual in orientation, you tend to end up with movies full of women talking -- if only tangentially -- about men.

That doesn't mean these movies are in any way diminishing of women, or that women are objects.  It just means the Bechdel Test has a built in assumption that romantic heroines are useless.  Which is kind of sexist in of itself.

The reality is that the female audience is mostly interested in romances and mellodramas about relationships, while the male audience is  mostly interested in romances and mellodramas about heroism, and media reflects that.  The Bechdel Test is subtly designed in such a way as to remove almost all media created for women (and *by* women) 

I mean, I don't think most of Jane Austen's works pass the Bechdel Test.  Nor do most of the works of Anais Nin.  Considering the huge popularity and mass appeal these authors have with women, and their almost complete lack of appeal to men, perhaps you can see why I think the Bechdel Test is basically a joke, and not a serious tool for serious inquiry.  it mostly illustrates that Lisa Bechdel (a lesbian) is biased against the heteronormative romance stories that most women self-select for. 

&gt; What isn't cool is that [Bronies] are ostracised and made fun of for liking a feminine show.

No, those men are made fun of for taking a show aimed at little girls and turning it into a creepy, perverse sex fantasy that borders of bestiality.  Those men are made fun of for being creepy, weird manchildren.

Bronies are the only group of men that have ever tried to convince me that it's perfectly normal and not at all creepy for adult men to pursue friendships with tween girls.  That's why they get looked down on.  Because they're skeezy.  As a guy with a twelve year old niece who is crazy into My Little Pony, I'm really not at all sympathetic to Bronies.  I want those guys as far away from my niece as possible.

&gt;When it comes to me, and people of my train of thought, the black woman truly does have the shit end of the stick when it comes to our society today...you can't possibly say that the black woman is on equal footing as the white man.

Did you know that black women are as likely to receive a loan from a bank as white men?  And that white women are less likely to receive the same loan?  And that black men are *even less* likely to receive that loan?  It's because there is a favorable bias and perception of black women as strong, capable, independent and matriarchal.  

Or just look at how much violence is directed at black men, and how completely biased the justice system is against them.  I think a lot of the harm done to black women is actually a secondary effect of America's long standing war on black men.

But race and gender aren't the same, and one of my major beefs with feminism is the way race and gender are treated the same.  I mean, they're completely different animals.

We could actually eliminate race.  Do you realize that?  We could all fuck until everyone is a nice shade of mocha with black hair and brown eyes.  Just make it a rule that everyone has to hook up with someone from the opposite end of the melanin scale and eventually race goes away.  You couldn't do that with gender.  We could make babies until the universe collapses from heat death, and there would still be men and women.

Likewise, when you have a majority that is oppressing an actual minority group, like whites vs blacks, the majority can actually effectively *Other* the other group.  They can effectively cut off all contact, freeze out the minority group, and have little or no personal interaction with that group.  Men can't do that to women.  Not really.

Henry Kissinger once quipped ""Nobody will ever win the battle of the sexes. There is too much fraternizing with the enemy.""  There's a lot of truth to that.  This is why patriarchy fell in a generation, but racism and white supremacy are more stubbornly persistent.  White people don't have black children, but men have daughters.  White people don't *need* black people in their lives, but men *need* women to have a complete and fulfilling life.  You can't wage war against an enemy that close, against an enemy that shares your bed and raises your children, that *is* your children.

&gt;I will say that yes, being black and being feminist can be frustrating because yes, there are white women out there that just don't get it.

Oh, I know.  I know.

&gt; I also find it unfair that you point to an unfinished product and call it proof of your argument. Grounds without water do not a cup of coffee make... not yet at least.

Okay, let's play with this metaphor.  What I am saying is that the grounds were put in the filter over a generation ago, and that the coffee is brewing.  The water is flowing and the pot is filling as we speak.  The coffee has been made. You're just being impatient, and demanding that water filter through coffee faster than the laws of physics allow for.  

You, and contemporary feminists, are suggesting that we need to put more grounds in the filter.  But have you ever tried adding grounds to a filter basket *while the coffee was brewing**?  It's a disaster.  A giant mess.  It totally screws up your pot of coffee.  Now think about Tumblr feminism, and Jezebel, and Anita Sarkeesian, and all the other tripe and twaddle that feminism churns out and inflicts on the world.  You see the connection?

&gt;The fact is that feminism still has a long way to go until it's goals are achieved. When those goals are achieved, then it will be dismantled.

But what if feminism is organic, and constantly developing new goals?  What if it keep inventing new justifications for its existence, no matter how ridiculous, just to keep going?

And really, what are feminism's goals?  Global censorship of ideas and thoughts that are offensive to feminism?  Is the banning of Robin Thicke's song on college radio stations only the beginning?  Does feminism only achieve its goals when free speech and expression have been sacrificed on the altar of political correctness?

Is perfect statistical parity a goal of feminism?  Are we only equal when 50% of CEOs are women?  Does it matter how that's achieved?  Do we just pass laws and apply force until everyone confirms to a statistical mean?

These are really important questions, and when you consider that the ""goals of feminism"" can be both infinite, affecting everything (after all, everything is political), and *utterly insane*.  

&gt;Sort of like how I won't need more aspirin once my headache goes away.

And what I'm suggesting is that if you take aspirin, you have to allow time for it to take effect.  If you swallow two aspirin, and then *immediately* say ""I still have a headache, better take more aspirin!"" and then just keep doing that, by the time the aspirin has affected your headache, you've overdosed on aspirin."

I'll leave the program with pretty much the same knowledge (and career options) as someone with a BSCS and all the prerequisites for a CS Masters. 

The *last* thing I'd want to do is enroll in a Masters program without a really solid CS foundation. That can very easily turn in to a really expensive mistake - and if your brother had issues with school in the past, I think it'd be a very risky decision. (If he had a strong GPA and had some CS coursework under his belt, I'd say to go for a Masters.)

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1388780064.0,"They were angry because Green was misusing the word ""abuse."" Green says that a couple of teenage boys making fun of teenage girls with arm hair (literally all humans have arm hair) is abusive. TiA got mad because ""abuse"" is supposed to only apply to real adult things, like beating the shit out of your romantic partner and stuff. Green fired back that children are fragile, and that plenty of teenagers are ridiculously oversensitive over things like arm hair -- and that one dumb fuck spouting bullshit on YouTube is enough for a *teenager* (not an adult) to feel really shitty about themselves.

I personally found it really ironic because a lot of the commenters had not watched the entire video Green was replying to, *and* TiA regularly makes fun of people who get touchy about the meaning of words. So a lot of TiA users were making a huge semantic argument, saying that using ""abuse"" that way was disrespectful of actual abuse. Meanwhile, they make fun of people who hold that using the word ""racism"" against individual instances of prejudice against a white person by a black person is not a valid use of the word ""racism.""

So it was hypocritical to the *extreme*."

totally_jawsome,AskWomen,1388780123.0,"Okay so I guess I have a habit of being friends with idiots...

But this last year has been a bit of a roller coaster of friendships. 

So my one friend, we've been friends since we were 17. (I'm 22) we met at school, she was the new kid. She walked in and came over to me and liked my shirt, she told me we'd be best friends. I agreed. And we did. For a while. But her family is UBER religious and they hated me and one of our mutual friends for stupid reasons. It kind of caused her to pull away, partially because she's immature and lets that kind of thing get to her. She's also really obsessed with male attention, she has tons of ""guy"" friends. I'll ask her to hang out and she says she's too busy to, (but of course she wants to *eye roll) but then I'll see tons of pictures of her and her guy friends hanging out. It's so frustrating. I know I have been an awesome friend to her, there whenever she needs me. But she's been a terrible friend to me. Only there if she needs something. So we've grown apart but I finally decided that no matter what I'm not giving her any more chances. Tired of her BS and taking advantage of me. Mutual friends don't really care.

I have two other friends that I recently stopped talking to because they are so so dumb. They're the kind of girls who whine about how crappy their boyfriend is (with good reason because they're awful guys), ask for advice, then run right back to the guy and expect me to be supportive. Rinse wash repeat at least 5 times. I'm so done with it. 

Also, the worst one that I refuse to be friends with is my guyfriend Adam. He and I have known each other since middle school. We got really close during high school and have always been close. ALL of our friends are mutual so that's kind of hard. But anyways, I was having a family problem, my dad and I got into it over religion and we ended up not talking for a few months. He basically posted a status that said something like ""we need to get that Muslim out of office and get a christian in"" which IS SO DUMB. He was talking about Obama (who has never come out as being muslim) and Romney (who is MORMON?) and I told him ""hey dude you should do your research before you post a retarded status"". After a few stupid back and forth comments he told me ""it's your stupid liberal beliefs that caused your family to stop talking to you"" something like that. It was just too much. To add to that he's homophobic, racist, and an idiot. So we stopped talking. He refused to apologize as well.


I think when I was younger I had a habit of making friends with people and ignoring the signs of a bad friend. Now I am making friends and being careful with it because damn, I'm tired of this. I keep meeting people who don't take friendship seriously. They don't care about anything but themselves, sooo selfish. I fear that a lot of people in my generation don't appreciate friendship. I just want to find someone who values it like I do. I will be there at any time, I will give you the clothes off my back. I have done sooo much for my friends and I don't expect anything in return. Just appreciate me for the kind of friend I am. It's so hard to find."

So accessories that has to do *with* the computer, rather than accessories that go with the computer, would be my suggestion.

Or maybe some cold-cathodes for lighting up the case? I don't know if he's into that, but they're pretty cheap-ish. Google ""Cold cathode 12V"" - they're like, $20. It's a bad idea if he has the computer in his bedroom.

Now that we have a source to show that the Titan is rivaled, we need to compare the reference 780 ti, but this is difficult to find a direct comparison between the two models. So for placebo we will use Titan vs 780 ti.

[Comparison](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7492/the-geforce-gtx-780-ti-review/14)

So there is a little difference.

Lets look at prices and see if it justifies the price:

[GTX 780 ti reference (pick your model)](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/video-card/#c=153&amp;sort=a7)

I could not, however, be with a guy that was just lazy and didn't want to leave mommy and daddy. 

Right now boyfriend and I are working on moving out but since both of us are crawling out of school debt and life stuff we are just taking it day by day. Our families are supportive and understanding of the situation so why not?"

tattedspyder,pics,1388780755.0,"Basic inspections for contaminants (mold/mites/pests) are easy, a glance under a microscope and you'll see whether or not the bud is clean.

Tests for potency (THC content) are a bit trickier but can be done quickly, in house by the dispensaries and do nothing but help the dispensary.  With knowing the THC content of the bud they buy a dispensary can pay the growers a fair price (low for shwag, high for dank), charge the customers a fair price, and can provide a consistent product.

I understand that by saying ""we don't test, we don't know what's in it"" they are limiting their liability because they take zero responsibility for what they are selling, but that is a massive turn off for any reasonably intelligent consumer.  Would you buy food from a place that claims no knowledge of the ingredients or quality?  

Sure, the denial of responsibility *may* help protect them from liability, but it's also going to damage their reputation, reduce their customer base, and decrease their profits.  If I were running a dispensary I'd rather spend the time, money, and effort on ensuring I sold a quality product and having a good rep, than wash my hands of all responsibility, sell whatever comes through the door, and ending up with a crappy reputation.

But when they become hypocritical, I'm out. I really think that what they're doing needs to be done by people with experience critiquing feminism and sociology or whatever umbrella the shit they find falls under. You can't ask a creationist to critique an evopsych asshole who's gone too far. You call in someone who has experience and academic knowledge in actual evolutionary theory and science.

There's too much ""this is completely invalid from top to bottom"" in TiA, which is why I'm not there, despite being equally contemptuous of poorly done sociological blatherings. I'm not enough of a masochist to butt heads with people who would spit on my entire academic career. Not all of TiA is like that. But enough that I'm not involved.

I used to be involved in aSRS at the very beginning for the same reasons -- SRS was really, really *bad* for a while, and it was annoying. I was annoyed by the bad sociology.

Once you're registered, each time these people call you, state, ""This number is registered on the National Do Not Call list.

The next time they call give them the same line, but also remind them that you are within your rights to have all communication in writing.  Request that all further communication be in writing to the address they have on file.  Chances are good it is not your address.

The fact that you visited it and felt underwhelmed isn't, IMHO, a bad thing. It made you feel an emotion, even if that emotion was let down. It also left you curious -- curious enough to ask about it. What the hell do other people see in it?

Every cut of meat is going to have a different method and final internal temp. Some examples-

Steak. Cook at high temp (500+) to an internal temp of 125-150 depending on your own taste. (usually about a 15 minute cook)  

Pork Tenderloin. Cook at medium temp (350) to internal temp of 140-160, depending on your taste. (usually about 15min/pound)

Chicken. Medium Temp (350) to internal temp of 160(breast)/180(dark meat). Look into spatchcock chicken, its really good. (usually 45-60 min)

Pork Shoulder (butt) Cook at low (325-350) for 1.5-2 hours per pound until internal temp is between 190-200. (could be 12-18 hours)

Unfortunately if your tenderloin go to 158 and spent 45 more minutes on the grill, its probably WAY overdone.

* Front Squats

* Snatch Grip Deadlifts

* Snatch Grip Romanian Deadlifts 

* Pendlay Rows

Just slight variations on exercises you're probably familiar with that can add an extra ""punch"" to your workouts effectiveness.

One of the lines that stuck out was something like, ""People that listen to conventional wisdom are conventional people. Exceptional people listen to exceptional wisdom. There is a reason why a majority of people aren't exceptional, it's because they are all listening to the conventional wisdom you've been told. Work hard, invest into a safe low yield stocks, live frugally, and don't take risks. If you tried to tell them that they're wrong, they'll yell at you for being ridiculous too far outside of conventional norms. They'll tell you to listen to their wonderful conventional advice. But their advice is terrible. I don't want to be anything like them.""

I learned of [MineTweaker](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1886008-minetweaker-add-and-remove-recipes-make-tweaks/) the other day.

Sometimes it was *really* hard. Especially seeing as the pagan was the first person I ever dated. We got into it a lot about our beliefs but it also shaped me as a person. 

I am a lot more open to things now and I think he helped with that. I was forced to see different things. I like that. 

I honestly would rather not date a Christian even though that's the religion I would identify with. I just don't like the BS that comes along with it. I get along better with agnostics anyways. Plus I love conversing about stuff so having different beliefs is fun.

The more you broaden you social circle (they don't all have to be best friends, just people who you get to know a bit and you know each other's names), the greater chance you have of meeting partners.

In the end, though, you should put a priority on your education and building a good overall social experience for yourself, not on finding dates or a girlfriend. If it happens, awesome, but don't focus too much energy on it, or it could bring you down.

ebonlance,Warmachine,1388781279.0,"A skarlock is a must-own for Cryx so I would definitely prioritize it. He actually can't cast Caustic Mist since it's a range CTRL spell - he's there to upkeep-cycle or cast Parasite another Excarnate.

I find that while the Deathjack is incredible he's not significantly more sturdy than any other Helljack and is therefore a magnet for enemy hate, limiting your options in a lot of cases as your opponent structures his force around receiving him. It's one of the reasons I prefer a similar warjack with comparable damage output but a lower profile on the table, like a Seether. Granted a Seether puts out a lot less damage than  DJ but with Parasite on hard targets it's usually a moot point. 

The biggest problem with any Cryx list is that you have a lot of guys that need protection and a very limited number of clouds. Legion in particular hurts because they can see right through anyway so I'm not surprised that a pThag tarpit was a bad matchup. What was he leading off with? Legionnaires feeding into a spawning vessel or beasts all the way down? Striders will pick off literally all of our good shit so you need to be really careful about deployment and who you lead with. 

Another thing I'd add would be Saxon Orrik to give things pathfinder too. When you need to worry about terrain but your opponent doesn't it leads to some very one-sided exchanges.

In theory the blood witches should be a problem for most jamming units. Effective PS12 charges will take down most shieldwallers, and even multi-wound models should fall in short order if you can apply Parasite as well. But that may well be the only thing they do the whole game, and your opponent won't bother walling up against you since all of your damage rolls will kill their infantry either way. If you go incorp they might just decide to walk heavies right through you (especially if I'm playing pThag, those ARM22 heavies won't take shit on average rolls from a PS12 free strike. I'm not saying they're not useful but I think they probably require a lot of finesse to use effectively, and I simply don't have the expertise with them to advise you on their use, only how I'd deal with it from the opposite side.

It's just funny that you have a guy who raps about killing people, and then he hits one woman and people talk about losing support.

I don't think you'll find many who would object to these (I personally would add environmental regulation too, but let's leave that for later). Regulations like these are what people demand, I don't think anyone in their right mind is after stopping any and all construction projects forever. But you should realize that, given the current scale of corruption, these regulations would end up stalling most projects anyway, and as a result we would still have the government folks (and their supporters) complain that this and that arbitrary group is working against our nation to stop these big projects. And they would technically be right (on the stopping part, not 'against our nation' part), if said projects are run by corrupt people (and you claim that, inevitably, they will be).

So basically what I'm saying is, regulation will inevitably stall these projects, and we either put up with extended timelines or corruption. I lean towards the former."

Ensurdagen,changemyview,1388781633.0,"&gt; you are programed by society for failure.

My self-awareness is obviously a result of how society taught me to perceive the world, any conviction that we create ancient concepts like that ourselves is arrogant. I haven't invalidated my claim, self-awareness doesn't make me a female president. It doesn't even make me wanna be a male president, or CEO, or anything. I'm not a mindless sheep, I've gotten lucky with my upbringing and genetics and have goals associated with that. Devaluing the influence of society doesn't remove it from existence, people don't create themselves with zero input--it's the exact opposite.

&gt; Leary acid blah blah

I love drugs, man. They taught me a whole lot, but they don't change the fact that my brain is physical in nature and entirely built by my genetics and perceived environment. My internal dialogue is reactive, to claim otherwise is to create a mystical other within the human brain that gives us agency that transcends our society--a Christian, born a Christian, ready to die a Christian, having never left their Christian community, doesn't get to choose to be Hindu. It's literally physically impossible, their perceived reality thus far hasn't even presented them with the concept yet. Their Christian label doesn't restrict them, it's the stability of their current lifestyle and the way other people in their society affirm it. Labels describe already existing systems within society, if the collective label ""feminism"" was totally abolished somehow without changing anything else, nothing would change.

&gt; It's all fucking illusions, man. You have to pull the wool over your own eyes.

So you're saying that being inaccurate and agreeing with Nietzsche's once innovative but now outdated ideas is more important than having actual knowledge? The human spirit can use conviction to achieve things, sure, but feminism isn't the force that inspired nihilism in the majority of people in the first place. Nietzsche noticed this far before feminism existed.

&gt; What are ""clear psychological effects?"" What does that even mean?

It means that you should base your viewpoint on empirical models, because they are the closest you can get to mutually perceived reality. The longer your chain of thought makes assumptions and claims without performing tests to make sure it's right, the lower your chance of being right is. You don't have any proof that your way to interpret feminist influence is accurate.

&gt; If you make decisions based off this model of reality, you will make inefficient and ineffective decisions.

Sure, but even a feminist isn't dumb enough to apply it to absolutely everything. Feminism is more of a cool thing to call one's self and be lazy about actually thinking about. Feminism has very little influence on the everyday lives of people, and this isn't gonna change because, as you said, it's inaccurate. Feminists are so incompetent at even defining it, there's no way it has similar emotional effects on all of them--no matter how many times you insist it.

&gt; So you can become a big dumb internet joke.

Are you saying the sole reason that stupid woman isn't running for president or a ceo is her feminism? Did feminism pave the path for women to follow those roads directly, and then put a velvet rope over it? I'm positive they only paved a small section of the path. You don't even have historical evidence, it's not like the second wave of feminism caused a huge surge of female ceos and politicians while the third wave reduced those numbers. Your beliefs have no precedent. 

&gt; Tumblr

You think people posting gifs on tumblr all day aren't running for president directly because they are feminists? What about the ones posting cat pictures, is their love of cat pictures the sole reason that they are unsuccessful, or do you not think that because you don't have a negative emotional response to cat pictures?

1. Legal concerns. Patenting the blueprints of life interferes greatly with farmers' livelihoods. It makes it illegal to save seed and you can be sued for patent infringement for organisms you didn't plant. 

2. Environmental concerns. With each new GMO product, farmers are using more pesticides and herbicides. When you design roundup ready corn it means there will be a whole lot more roundup in our ecosystems. 

3. Food supply concerns. This for me is the biggest one. Biodiversity is of crucial importance to our food supply. When everyone is planting the same type of designer crop, that's a huge chunk of our food supply at risk from one pest or disease or drought.

turtlehana,TrueAtheism,1388781672.0,"I tried to believe. I went to youth group, talked to my Christian husband, went to a Christian college, and studied religion. I just couldn't believe but I still called myself agnostic. 

Then my husband in his search to answer my questions one day told me that he cannot believe anymore. (After 8 years together). 

We did some evaluation of religions and their commonalities and decided that there are lots of gods that we no longer believe in like Mayan, Egyptian, Greek, etc and that with all the religions in the world (that are pretty similar) people put a lot of faith in just one. That to us it just didn't make sense to believe that one when all the others not ""real"" either. 

Additionally we decided we don't need to know if there is a creator. That we certainly don't believe any current religions. That perhaps we don't have to know and we are okay with that. 

Then we started calling ourselves atheist. "

Fizjig,SaltLakeCity,1388781678.0,"I joined a friend of mine who goes to the temple downtown that has been mentioned in the comments (Behind the salt palace) for Sunday service once. I should mention that I am not religious myself. 

There was a period of chanting and meditation followed by a gentleman who got up and spoke intelligently about his experiences as a Buddhist. It was not preachy, and he made a lot of good points about life in general. He also made me laugh several times. He had a good sense of humor. 

Overall, it was a good experience for me. It was very welcoming and relaxed. I felt no pressure to join, or attend again. I would go back willingly, not to ""convert"" but to be around such a warm, positive group of people. "
IndignantChubbs,AdviceAnimals,1388781678.0,"I agree that blanket sympathy doesn't make sense, but I think there's an important point here about judgment and empathy. Context matters a hell of a lot. Like, you can sit in judgment of people who stone women to death, but the fact is that used to be what pretty much everyone did. That doesn't mean everyone used to be just moral midgets compared to us; it means that the context has changed enough, that we have come to expand our moral sphere and recognize the injustice of such a practice. 

Likewise, when people make poor personal behavioral decisions, you need to at least explore the possibility that they aren't just weak. Maybe they are; I don't believe everyone is entitled to total sympathy. But none of us have total self-discipline, all of us have failures of willpower and self-accountability. Sometimes, people don't expect enough out of themselves. But sometimes, we expect too much out of others.

So if you judge a fat person for staying fat, remember that what they would have to do to change their situation is probably an enormous burden for them to bear, and one that plenty of average (and non-obese) people would not be able to accomplish easily. I'm not saying they shouldn't try, or that you should just pity them. But condemning all fat people is arrogant. You have to know a little bit about a person's situation before you can call them lazy or weak. "

When you are alone, don't say a word, stare at him, I mean bore a hole through him until he looks at you.

sunshinerf,AskWomen,1388781888.0,"What made us friends initially: Can't really remember. I was 12 years old, he was 15 and we hung out with the same bad crowd. We became really good friends and he even dated my bestie for a couple of years. When we grew up we were roommates for almost 4 years along with another childhood friend. We moved to the other side of the planet together.

Why did things break off: When the 3 of us moved to LA, we each kind of found our own place, except for him. He kept being clingy and expected us to be the same but truth is you grow up and you want different things in life. He refused to grow up. Then when we decided we are moving out and not going to live together anymore because it ruins our friendship he disappeared. Our other best friend's dad passed away and he had to fly home. I was left alone to pack the apartment and pay all the bills. He said he'll be back next week and then I haven't heard from him in 5 years! 

How did mutual friend handle it: When he disappeared he cut ties with everyone in LA. The friends back home had some trouble because he would talk shit about us and blame us for things we had nothing to do with. We found out these things only later, like that he got a DUI and blamed us because neither of us wanted to go out with him that night. Luckily, we were on different continents so it wasn't too much trouble. At some point he came back to LA and talked to a friend I stored all his stuff with. He told that guy he doesn't want any of it because it makes him think of us. Idiot!

How do I deal with running into him now: I don't! Last month, after 5 years, he suddenly decided to reach out to us. Our other old roommate is more forgiving than I am, he actually let him come out and stay at his house. I refused to talk to him. I had to go there for my friend's B-day party but the jackass was warned not to try to talk to me and since he would be on the street if he did try it, he followed through. I can't accept him back into my life 5 years later like nothing happened. He never even apologized. Fuck him!

tl;dr childhood friend I was roommates with blamed me for his fucked up life and bailed on me with the apartment when things got rough and I needed his help.

You continue to ignore the fact that you can transcend all of these negative emotions with a bit of psychology and meditation. (by a bit, I again mean a lot of work over years of time--nobody gets anything worth having without a lot of work.)

Obviously getting a girl of your dreams that likes you wouldn't solve your problem RIGHT NOW, because you're too much of a pessimistic loser to even get out of bed, much less show up in a relationship. Your ugliness has ceased to even be a problem, and yet you continue to focus on it because your emotional state has you incapable of making accurate value judgements.

My younger siblings have been feed a steady diet of creationism but they aren't anti-science per say and are beginning to question what my parents have taught them. 

My stepmother and father however have begun to swing on the side of anti-science. Not because it is expensive and not because they have a vested interest in particular focuses in the study, but because it directly challenges their belief system simply by existing. My little sister has begun to ask me questions about evolution and science and since then my parents have doubled down on their efforts to push their beliefs because of it. My stepmother recently called Carl Sagan a fraud at a family event and my dad has recently begun to talk to me and email me articles pertaining to the ""religion of science"". 

They don't care about science, they don't care about what science does, and they don't care what scientists are capable of. They do, however, care very much that their youngest grown children are now old enough to critically analyze creationism and they care that science has begun to offer them a different view of the world.

No. It merely exists and it's existence challenges the beliefs they've instilled in my siblings and that they find is a problem. "

Saying ""just have a little willpower"" makes it seem like this isn't something you understand.  And you may understand it, and willpower may be the only thing that works in the end, but telling someone to have a little willpower doesn't actually help anyone.  It's actually incredibly discouraging because it's such simple advice and you know it would work if you could do it, but pretty much everything else in your life is pushing against that."

Celebreth,AskHistorians,1388782561.0,"I'll go ahead and quote from one of the most famous orators of the day to answer this one rather succinctly :)

&gt; This is what I wish for my orator: when it is reported that he is going to speak let every place on the benches be taken, the judges' tribunal full, the clerks busy and obliging in assigning or giving up places, a listening crowd thronging about, the presiding judge erect and attentive; when the speaker rises the whole throng will give a sign for silence, then expressions of assent, frequent applause; laughter when he wills it, or if he wills, tears; so that a mere passer-by observing from a distance, though quite ignorant of the case in question, will recognise that he is succeeding and that a Roscius [Famous actor] is on stage.

~ Cicero

So yes - a good orator would speak just as much with his *emotive* expression as he did with his verbal expression - even if someone couldn't quite hear the exact words he was saying, his bodily emotion and expression should have been able to convey it as well.

Anxiety is a big problem in today's society in general, so you're definitely not alone.  Just focus on taking care of yourself and try to get it under control.  Being less anxious can only make you feel better.  As for your mom, it should also help to know that there's no way for you to ""catch"" being bipolar or other mental disorders.  I'm sure you're aware of that, but sometimes it helps to see it written down.  If it's a trigger for your anxiety, that's something you need to tell the counselor and he or she will help you work through it.  Please make controlling your anxiety a priority though.  It really wears on your mind and body to be that stressed out at it's really not necessary.  I sincerely hope that things get better! "

What the bloody hell. My dad's not a violent man by any means... but I assume that if anyone tried to attack me my dad would do his very best to keep me away from them!

My boyfriend said something similar recently. I won't go into the long story, but I do standup comedy &amp; a fan turned bad and stalked me quite horribly last year. I have Crohn's and am on chemo, and the whole thing was very stressful especially since I was finding it hard to cope anyway, let alone having this guy to worry about too. In the end it got so nasty that we had to call the police, and since then he hasn't bothered me but I know he's still 'around' (as in, not in jail). I still panic sometime if I think I see him, or I check his twitter and notice he's in town.

Basically, my boyfriend remarked that if this was 20-30 years ago, we wouldn't have called the police but he'd have rang his mates &amp; brother, and my brother and his friends, and they'd have had 'words' with my stalker the next time they saw him. Nothing bad, nothing violent, just 'words' and it would most likely stop.

Instead the result was quite impotent. The police gave him a caution &amp; me an emergency number, but I found out from a female comedian friend (also young and blonde, like me) that he'd been bothering her not even 6 months after the police got involved for me."

I could accept interdependence, I cannot accept dependence. I definitely agree men and women bring different things to the table but I dislike traditional gender roles. A man shouldn't assume that I can't use a hammer because I am a woman.  I have always been rather tomboyish and somehow my capability at ""traditionally male"" activities seems to intimidate men. I can chop my own wood, fix the plumbing and get things off the top shelf.  I don't want to have to give up that kind of independence, I don't want to have to wait till my guy gets home to deal with a spider for example.  And yet many guys I have been with seem to expect me to be somewhat helpless, and when I do any of these 'manly' activities for myself, they get upset.

Still, one thing you DO need is an understanding of music theory, especially if you're going to be doing collaborative songwriting or learning/teaching songs to bandmates.

You need to be able to know how to build major and minor chords, the different kinds of 7ths, rhythm, and meter. Those are things that are made a lot easier by working with written music, though there are other ways to visualize or conceptualize them.

It's never a useless skill to have regardless of your goals, but I did see that you are interested in writing music.

Rinnve,russia,1388783028.0,"&gt; as well as give me something to talk about with any Russian person

That can be a problem. Russian culture is kind of diverse. For example some people (like me, yeah) would very much like to talk about Strugatsky sci-fi novels, some would detest those and some just don't give a nothing. Same goes for most recent writers, and the same goes for ""real classics"" like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy which are must read in schools and for that reason are disliked by many. (And there was this thing called USSR that changed our culture in too many ways, so Turgenev's and Dostoyevsky's Russia was a very, very different country in the same geographical borders.) Don't expect that after reading some book you'll be able to discuss it (or related material) with *any* Russian. Read something that you enjoy.

As for suggestions, it depends on what do you prefer; but if you're interested with modern Russian culture, I'd start with 20th century literature. Strugatsky brothers for real deep sci-fi (though more social than pure scientific). Boris Polevoy for a great WW2 story (""Повесть о настоящем человеке""). Victor Pelevin for really mind-bending postmodern fiction that is also deeply connected with recent Russian history. Also, my personal suggestion would be Valentin Kataev's ""Белеет парус одинокий"" (basically early 20th century events in teenager's eyes). And if you want ""real classics"", avoid Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. This shit is too deep and... well... too shit. Sorry. Gogol, Turgenev, Paustovsky and Chekhov are the way to go. ""Вечера на хуторе близ Диканьки"" and ""Записки охотника"" are frakking brilliant."

kyrostolar,AdviceAnimals,1388783237.0,"If you were paying attention, you'd know that 'women have the choice' isn't always true. Apparently from this thread it's even less true than I expected.

And if you haven't noticed, this is an unpopular opinion with an equality agenda. Can you count the number of unexpected pregnancies from consensual couples that have come to term with one or both parents not ready nor willing to raise a child at that time? In so many cases, both parties were very willing to have sex and not at all willing to procreate. A woman deciding to carry the child to term and demand the father's participation in raising said child is a snare buried in the inequality of genetics and politics. If the tables were turned, as in countless cases it has been, it would be misogyny.

Yes, there's inequality as so many redditors have argued. Different genetic build, different requirements, complete equality is impossible in that sense. Simply answer? Push our way as close to equality as possible. Frankly, the world is overpopulated; we need to reevaluate our understanding of the sanctity of life when the priority of our species is no longer to reproduce for a healthy survival, but to survive for a healthy reproduction. 

Edit: Just to clarify, I do disagree with OP's restrictive view on women's choice in abortions.

Are you dead set on S&amp;T? If so, download the Vault guide for trading interviews so you know what questions you'll be asked and how to prepare. It will be critical for you to nail any brain teasers and bond / stock math questions because you're already going to be considered a 'Non-target Candidate.' It's not impossible for you to land the internship, but it will be tough. So make sure that you nail the interview Q's.

Secondly, you're going to need to work up a story about how your experiences in engineering and passion for finance has led you to desire a trading job instead of an engineering job. Up to you how you want to weave it all together, but it needs to sound somewhat credible and believable (if it looks like you're just applying because you love the movie ""Wall Street"" or just want to ""make a ton of money,"" you'll be SOL).

As for your resume question, go to Mergers &amp; Inquisitions or Street of Walls and download their model finance resume format for investment banking and trading internships.

vertazontal,EarthPorn,1388783554.0,"I think the most concise way to describe this concept is as follows:

Photography was started as a means of making a permanent physical image created by light, and painting can be described as making a permanent physical image from paint. In the same way a painter cannot paint *exactly* what they see in front of them, a photographer cannot photograph *exactly* what is in front of them. Photography is faster and more accurate than painting, but no medium is capable of directly transcribing and repeating a sensory experience precisely.

It's a very, very nit-picky and small detail, but as a photographer it's one I have to concern myself with. Of course a photograph will get -pretty close- to repeating the scene which was in the frame, but when one asks the question ""is this the water color natural"", it's worth mentioning that nothing except actually being in that moment will answer the question of what the water color was.

edit: Generally, one of the most useful ways to think about photographs is not as a record of an experience or a scene but as an intentional creation similar to a painting. The difference between photography and painting is that basically everyone can create a photorealistic painting, but the skill of the photographer is a result of their thoughtfulness, craft, and artistic skill in doing so."

She already cancelled out his velocity by holding him in place, man!

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1388783692.0,"Depends on your interpretation, and in this case, I don't agree with your argument at all.  What is the end that is being achieved?    That's why Breaking Bad is a poor example - it achieved its ends, which is to be a successful TV show that told its story from beginning to end, as opposed to being canceled or being forced to wrap up early.  

But a relationship?  A relationship has no ends to achieve.  That whole argument that you're trying to make is based on the fact that a relationship is trying to achieve some sort of ends, which would mean the relationship would come to an end once it fulfills that purpose.  But you don't get into a relationship to achieve some sort of ends.  Therefore, the first part doesn't apply, so only the second part does.

The problem here is that people see ""failure"" as a terrible thing, and are looking to make it sound better.  You can twist the way a relationship ended and say that it wasn't a failure, because at least you learned something, but that would still be twisting things just to make them in your favor. You can still fail while learning something and that's okay, so I see no reason to have to do that.  I don't see why everyone gets so upset at the word ""failure.""

rick2g,compsci,1388783757.0,"Yeah... 'cause a psuedo-quantum machine can become true quantum by ingestion of money.

...there are some *severe* practical hurdles between what D-Wave puts out and a true Shor-capable quantum computer.  It's not just a matter of simple engineering - where all the requirements are well-understood and all the parts are all already available for bidding.  There are still *huge* gaps in the required capabilities involving some very fundamental limits to maintaining and manipulating quantum states.

Perhaps you've noticed that there's a steady stream of quantum 'breakthroughs' reported throughout the year.  Every year.  For the past 20 years.  Constant breakthroughs, yet no quantum computer.  Perhaps that might indicate to an experienced observer that the number of breakthroughs still required is potentially *very* large.

Last I checked, factoring with 7 qubits was achieved in 2001, and researchers managed to factor the number 15.  Now, 12 years later, the state-of-the-art is *still* at 7 qubits, and 21 is the largest number yet factored using Shor's.  I believe that the adiabatic method was used to factor a larger number (a bit &gt;100 IIRC), but that method is already believed to be impractical to scale to larger numbers (there's some ugly exponents involved when increasing qubits).

Bottom line - nobody knows yet if we even have the required technology, or the proper understanding of quantum mechanics to properly construct a true QC.  We might be like some early ziggurat builders, trying to reach the moon with wood and stone.  We simply don't know how far away we are from true QC - that makes throwing money at it primarily a good way to waste money.  I'm not saying we shouldn't fund research, but we should understand that it's *research* - returns and results not guaranteed.

Frankly, $1 Billion for a scalable true quantum computer is cheap.  I'd guess we have another ~2 orders of magnitude in research required... and that might be a low-ball.

You can also use the code to upgrade to a larger print and it will just deduct the $70 value from the total.

SammaSunshine,stepparents,1388783830.0,"I think /u/LetLooseOnTheWeb gave you awesome advice! The only thing I wanted to add is that maybe you should have a serious talk with your fiance about discussing her sex with her kids. I think that if she doesn't try and create a home where her kids can talk to her, it could have negative repercussions. 

Her daughter is 14, a perfectly normal age to be curious about sex and her body, other sexualities, etc. Her learning about some of these things from her mother is definitely better than the internet, and its important that her daughter can feel comfortable talking to her about those things. It doesn't need to be explicit, your fiance can decide what she deems age appropriate. 

By having a really comfortable relationship with my mom, I not only was better educated than other girls my age, but when I did decide to have sex I talked to mom about it, got taken to the gynocologist, put on birth control and educated about safe sex. I think that my mother having an open door policy made my siblings and I really comfortable with our sexuality and made us less likely to do something stupid as teenagers. We have an amazing relationship to this day because of it. 

I understand that your fiance is conservative, and you probably don't want to tell her that you snooped, or what you found, BUT you do want to talk to her about discussing safe sex and bodily changes with her daughter for both of their benefit. "

All you have to do is drizzle some olive oil in a pan, dump the onions and stir occasionally until they're done. 

It's also a good idea to begin tasting different ingredients and broadening your palate, especially with spices. Once you know what most of the ingredients are in a dish, recipes start being less intimidating. Find out what thyme, rosemary, cumin, paprika, basil and sage taste like, for example. It's also a good idea to familiarize yourself with different cuts of meat, and poultry, and how to cook each properly. "

**Summary**

* Nuclei number increases before muscle fibers hypertrophy, which suggests that more nuclei increases the total protein synthesis capacity of the cells.

* Myonuclei number is permanent, even after atrophy due to disuse. 

* Because nuclei number is still elevated, a lessened increase in protein synthesis would be needed by each individual nuclei after atrophy of disuse. **i.e.** You don't have to work as hard to gain the muscle the second time. 


Maybe not exactly directly related to bodybuilding, but for overall health as the study states that satellite cell activation and myonuclei number may be diminished in the elderly. So, it may be necessary to increase nuclei number before late in life.

Another example: global trade has been developed in such a way as to allow the rich countries to be extremely hypocritical when it comes to protectionist economic policies. That is not inherent in capitalism. It's close to inherent in states, because states are amoral, power-seeking actors, but that's not a property of capitalism.

When it first came out, again on FC3, then FC2 after the last restart, and again on his SSP world. After time and experience he just has the knowledge on how to progress, that someone just starting out, not watching all the spotlights or LP's would know. When I started it I specifically didn't look up anything about it, because I wanted a fresh start, with 2 and 3 I read ahead and there was no mystery with it, just do this to get this like everything else. After starting and scanning most of the stuff in my inventory and every node in a 1k radius with bat morph, I still used up all my aspects trying different things in the research table. First discovery was the infernal furnace, of which I didn't know the aspects needed to make the research possible, next was the frost wand focus that I was also missing aspects for so could not complete. Flew across 2 oceans looking for nodes to scan, because they were the only things I could continue to get aspects off of. Eventually I got fed up and did what most people were doing and cheated by watching a video on how to unlock most of the aspects, and then opened a webpage on the forums with a list of them. After that it was a matter of just throwing everything I owned on the floor and scanning it. This being the beginning of the game I really had no machines yet, but was able to scan every vanilla item pretty quick. Went back to research, still lost them all trying to figure out the researches because I didn't have the mastery skills (was on a second part of that aspect video). Now that I've played it and failed 3 or 4 times I'm much better at going through opening all the important aspects, scanning a bunch, then unlocking the rest, then scanning some more, ONLY THEN do I start researching, and I start by shooting for mastery, instead of golums and infusion crafting like I was in the beginning. These are things that won't come to a new player, they're aspects that you have to either know someone who can show you how or where to look to aquire. Or you do like I did and just fail out over and over until you've got it then start a world. To me, that is bad game design. Don't get me wrong I love the mod and of all of it, that is about the only negative thing I have to say about it. But being that it is a part of the mod you see very early it sticks much more readily than say an issue with the very last research.

Edit: I would also mention in the 3 to 4 times I've jumped into this mod, I have yet to get the deconstruction table. I always end up with an endless line of wand foci (and never the one of equal trade which I would like)."

IndignantChubbs,politics,1388784262.0,"&gt;I think any money given by governments to ""science"" is open to political corruption.

I mean, theoretically, yes. Any money given to ""education"" is also open to political corruption. Does that mean we shouldn't fund schools? The *possibility* of government corruption does not imply the *probability* of it. In fact, a ton of scientific research is already funded by the government, and there is scarce evidence that it's systematically corrupted by politics (though the Bush administration did a number on the EPA -- there are examples). So I don't really worry about this issue.

&gt;Were walking a fine line here. Do you really want someone to afford the ""science"" to back his politics. Do you want the republicans to pay a scientist to obfuscate pollution causes?

Republicans already do. There's actually a bunch of information coming out about this right now, which I can link to if you'd like. 

In a perfect world money wouldn't have anything to do with what scientific voices get heard, but that is not within the realm of possibility. Serious, unbiased science needs advocacy because it's contending with hackish sophistry powered by money."

ZippityZoppity,DebateReligion,1388784330.0,"&gt;We also can't debate humans beings possess language and mathematics and abstract thinking and the capacity to create new things, while no animal does.

Actually, [non-human animals](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=alex-parrot-posthumous-paper-mathematical-genius) have been shown to understand mathematics and abstract thinking such as the value of zero. And it seems that many animals have language and can create tools.

&gt;We can't debate a first-person subjective view of reality exists and language and thoughts and beliefs exist independently from any material referent.

Well no, I would say language, thoughts and beliefs all exist on a neural substrate. Middle English didn't exist before the Anglo-Saxons moved to the British Isles and were conquered by the Normans. The syntax of language seems to be a universal trait, but it also is the only logical way to refer to something (e.g. having a subject verb an object). And beyond this, does a thought exist if there's no thing to think it? That doesn't really make sense.

&gt;We can't also debate that human beings are the only things in the known Universe to create literature and plays and movies and have the ability to see moral themes and ideals.

Sure, but in our experience humans are the only thing that display ethical codes. A dolphin could possibly understand moral themes, but frankly not care.

&gt;Except that humans are not the image of any animate or in animate thing in the known Universe.

And neither are octopi. I don't think I'm getting your point.

&gt;The distance from the earth to the farthest galaxy in the Universe is still smaller than the gap between the mind of a four year old child and the smartest animal.

Considering that non-human primates can learn foreign languages, construct tools, desire and take care of pets, refer to abstract concepts of memories, I would say that's a bold claim. Consider that the observable universe is 46 billion light years across, and the distance between us and chimpanzees and gorillas is 100 million and a few samples of amino acids. We're much closer than you think - although I appreciate the poetic sentiment.

&gt;The sum total complexity of our Universe is a speck compared to the complexity of a human mind. Animals may communicate with each other but animals do not ask questions about the Universe.

Humans *are a part of the universe* - we contribute to the complexity but we are not more complex than the set - that's impossible. We are but a piece in the puzzle of existence, not some outside observer. And do we know that animals don't ask questions? Do you have some sort of insight into the internal representations of animals that other don't? Perhaps animals do ask questions, but simply don't bother nor have the means to answer them."

When I did the big chop I donated it to [Pantene Beautiful Lengths](http://www.pantene.com/en-us/pantenebeautifullengths/pages/default.aspx), which works with the American Cancer Society and gives away free wigs to cancer patients. 

Locks of Love is the most well-known organization but has had some [criticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locks_of_Love#Criticisms) lately over missing hair donations ([$6 million worth per year](http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/05/13/locks-of-love-6-million-of-hair-donations-unaccounted-for-each-year/?utm_campaign=forbestwittersf&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social)) and having a very low donated hair to wig ratio - 328 hair donations accepted to produce 1 wig versus Pantene's 19 hair donations accepted to produce 1 wig. They've also gotten shit about selling hair donations, but they claim they only sell hair that isn't viable for wigs (which is about 80%!).

Not criticizing people who've donated to Locks of Love, just a reminder to everyone to research charities before you donate.

If I had to expand on it a bit, I'd say a lot of it has to do with how women exist within society. This is especially true pre 1900s, but it's still true today. Women look at men as providers of resources. Naturally women never worked in history, so men were their only access to resources. Men had to be constantly thinking about creating resources, and women had to constantly thinking about how to get these resources. While this has changed a bit today, it's still generally true. You don't see many male golddiggers. Nor do you see many women marrying poor men when they themselves are wealthy. For the most part men are still the providers of resources.

I'd argue that this is what creates this ""in the moment"" mentality. They are wired to always be living in the moment. They need to be finding men to give them resources, and at any moment their man can die in war, so they need to swing to another. They have to be selfish, because their selfishness is what is going to keep them alive. "

Or:

MSU v tOSU - look at how overrated tOSU was all year!

MSU v Stan - MSU played the best game of their year to beat Stanford

Wisconsin being the only ranked B1G to fall to SEC in a bowl = silence from ESPN

All of this is in regards to ESPN bias and I don't even know what my point is anymore. I'm just tired of the conference bias by reported and commentators.

Esotericgirl,relationship_advice,1388784587.0,"Things Will Get Better  
By: Bradley Lester  

Life can be unfair to us, we want to run and hide  
It's times like these you need a friend, to be right by your side  
We all have hurt and loneliness, we sometimes look away  
We try to hide these awful thoughts, each morning of each day  



We need to look within ourselves, and take the good inside  
As this will help us through these times, our dignity and pride  
Each day will help to heal the heart, we need to take things slow  
And just remember each of us, our kindness we must show  



People tend to hurt us, with reasons so unclear  
We cry and sob and feel alone, we long for someone near  
We seem so lost and frightened, the ache inside is real  
We sometimes want to look above, and humble as we kneel  



So take the good inside, and take things day by day  
Things will get better, as we move, along life's weary way  
We all are special don't forget, we need this to believe  
That one day things will shine for us, just close your eyes and dream

Having been used to the atmosphere in the Boston Garden (that's where I saw the Bruins play when I lived there), I was surprised by the friendly Avs crowd at Pepsi Center. 

I've only seen respect for fans wearing their home team's jerseys, but then, those fans are also respectful in the arena. In fact, at the Avs/Wings game, there was a sea of red in the arena with a nice rivalry going on in terms of cheering between Avs and Detroit fans. The Flyers fans were pretty loud last night, too. Last night, I also saw a guy wearing a Pens jersey and another wearing a Habs jersey. You'll see a few other jerseys around the arena. 

Brooklyn's is minimal walking distance next to Pepsi Center. It's not the best bar, but it's also a restaurant, and at least you won't have to travel far. Parking: plenty around the arena, just get there early because the crowds really show up a half-hour before the game starts, and everyone has to go through security.

But let's look at Prater: **1)** Only missed one field goal *all season* **2)** Set an NFL record for PATs **3)** Set the record for longest FG in NFL history **4)** (not as important, but not to be overlooked) Won the shootout against the Cowboys in Week 5.

For example, if all of the clinical trials for a dug used in an NME application or even NDA had to be prospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov for the FDA to consider the data it would go a LONG way to reducing the potential for cherrypicking studies.  

Additionally, making the raw data publicly available, and making the protocols fully available to the public for review would also add a huge degree of transparency to the entire drug approval process. 

Unfortunately our legislators and regulators feel the commercial interests of pharmaceutical companies are the primary interest, so they make sure to protect much of the information submitted in drug applications. 

But there are ways around it and huge improvements which could be made without having to go all the way to only considering third party research.

OP's post is all about her frustrations, her feelings of inadequacy, her feelings that her struggles are minimized.  Your comment, the top comment, politely dismissed her as whining and not trying hard enough.  Isn't there a place for sympathy?  For saying, hey, yes, we're human, people have flaws and struggle to overcome them?  I don't see anything in this post that says that OP lacks desire to lose weight or that she's happy about being 100 pounds overweight, but I do see a lot about her being frustrated, tired, feeling overwhelmed, and feeling belittled and attacked.  Your suggestion about developing willpower like it's a muscle is more helpful and constructive, but just saying ""try harder"" can actually be more harmful than helpful, because it makes people feel like they just can't do it and like nobody understands how hard they're trying already.

TheLittleGoodWolf,MensRights,1388785038.0,"That's pretty much the story of my youth and the entirety of my teens.

To make a long story short; I grew up with a single mother who had been brutally abused and mistreated in one relationship and had a really nasty divorce with my father several years after that. It's all fact checked so I know it's not BS. She had largely feminist views during my upbringing and that's what I got to hear as I grew up. ""Men do this"", ""men do that"", ""men have treated women bad for ages"", ""don't be like your father"", ""don't be like those men"", ""don't rape"", stuff like that. To be fair it wasn't all that much and there was lots of good things too but it did leave an impact on me. The message from society was pretty much the same too.

Then at about 6 years old I was sexually used by a girl one year older than me. I'm sure she had no idea what she was doing either and I can only begin to imagine how that happened, but that's beside the point. I saw myself as a monster for a long, long time after that, I saw every sexual thought I ever had as evil and destructive. By just imagining a woman naked I felt as if I had raped her.

Needless to say I was shy of physical contact and thus rarely had relationships, and either didn't see or brushed off any advances. When I did get a girlfriend I felt bad for even wanting to kiss her. Yeah, you read that. That relationship died pretty soon but she did string me along for a few years (long story).

It wasn't until I was 18 that I would have (sort of) sex with a girl my age and I had a raging boner during the foreplay but lost it the second I entered her. In retrospect the pressure of the situation and a condom that was too tight was probably the biggest cause of that. Anyways, I still had troubles fathoming that she could actually *want* to have sex with me. There was a big logical conflict in my brain for a long time after that.

Yeah so this turned out to be a long story... sorry about that... anyways I slowly got better and could start to enjoy and even be proud of my own sexuality (I'm pretty blessed in more ways than one /humblebrag) and today I kind of function pretty well.

End of story on to advice.

Firstly stay away from people who study these areas in social sciences, they are not all bad but the risk is significantly higher.

Second, get to know the girl beforehand, bring up a lightly charged topic that will help you understand her opinions. If you are bold bring up a more charged topic.

Thirdly surround yourself with decent people who think similarly to you. The chance of finding someone you like is higher and the chance of them being an idiot or similar is lower. If you don't already get new and better friends.

Fourthly, and this one is important, the risk of being falsely accused is low, really low, far from low enough but still pretty damn low. Same with the risk of being raped. And if you keep your wits about you the risk gets even lower. It's still there but don't let it rule your life, respect the danger but don't let it control you and break you.

Fifth, get yourself a fleshlight or similar, those things have gotten me through a few dry spells wonderfully. It's a million times better to have real sex but (at least for me) it lowers the perceived importance of it all. I can focus more on finding someone I like a lot rather than ""settling"" which won't make you happy in the end.

Sixthly, focus on what makes you happy and if you feel to down stay the fuck away from this place. There are some happy stories but since it's about a problem and examples of the problem makes you sad. Much like in the real world, if you want to feel a bit happier try staying away from the news and similar media (this includes reddit and facebook) and watch good movies or read good books instead. The news are most often the ""bad"" news and that makes us see the world as a terrible place. Sure terrible things happen but not all the time and not always.

These are my tips and suggestions."

Dantilli,introvert,1388785047.0,"I have a few suggestions.

**1)** Instead of staying up late, get up earlier. Start your day with some peace and quiet, take a walk or exercise as soon as you get up then have a nice shower. As soon as I started doing this I felt SO much better about facing the days ahead of me. Also try and get some natural light when you get up too as it definitely helps wake you up.

**2)** I know you mentioned work, how much does that restrict you? If you do have some time I would recommend going out to a local library or somewhere. I'm at uni and it's pretty damn loud most of the time where I live so I often just go and sit in the library and read or study. Being a library it is guaranteed to be quiet and you have unlimited entertainment all around you.

**3)** This is the more extreme option which I would not recommend in most circumstances but some people won't listen otherwise. That is, instead of shying away from a conflict and letting him do what he wants, put your foot down in terms of giving you some peace and quiet. I mean go until you're both red with fury or crying and make a stand for yourself as this is really affecting your life in a bad way. Show him in no uncertain terms how strongly this is affecting you, it may take a bit of effort but it may be one of the only ways to make him understand how this is making you feel.

But DO NOT just try and get around him, you're related for fuck sake, he should have some consideration. **Make some kind of compromise**.

I feel I have to mention this but maybe he isn't receptive to your needs because he feels you don't respect his. This is very often the case, I've seen it SO many times. It's likely he feel underappreciated and not respected in some way by you and so feels like he doesn't need to respect you in these areas. I may be wrong with this but keep in mind that this could be a possibility so you don't start shouting at him for how ridiculous an idea it is. Instead keep calm and try and explain everything clearly. 

It just occurred to me that he might not understand that you actually need space, he might just think that you're being fickle. That you're there when you want to be, but when it doesn't suit you you're just going to shun him until you can be bothered with him again. This isn't how you think, obviously, but it is definitely one way in which your actions could be interpreted.

If he does have some problem with you or the situation, no matter how ridiculous, don't just discount it. It is the way it is in his head so don't go shouting at him how ridiculous it sounds. Instead explain and demonstrate in other ways how the way he thinks is skewed. Finally also consider the fact that your own thoughts are also biased and you may be thinking about the situation wrong. That you might actually BE in the wrong to some extent.

Hopefully this helps you somehow :). It's probably way too many words for what I actually wanted to say, but I hope it still makes some kind of sense.

TL;DR: wake up early and exercise. Try going to library. Confront him and make a stand, but respect and understand his view on the situation and accept that you might also be in the wrong."

Okay, this is going to sound like a pitch, but I used to use Odaban. For whatever reason, I stopped sweating as much when I was 25, but, man, [ODABAN](http://www.odaban.com) is the shit.

I was skeptical, but I tried it out. I sprayed some on before I went to bed, as directed. I couldn't sleep because of the painful burning in my pits, so I rubbed some hydrocortisone cream on them and dejectedly called it a night, sure that another product had failed.

Not Odaban. Oh, no. I'm pretty sure it burned away all of my sweat-producers. I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to love a product that feels like a chemical peel under you arms, but I was bone dry and hooked. I was in love with Odaban. Sure, I had to use steroid cream to assuage the side-effects, but for the first time in more than a decade, I was not sweaty. In fact, I was pretty sure I had lost the ability to sweat under my arms until I forgot to reorder more.

I am not joking. This product burns like a motherfucker, but it WORKS. It's a price I was willing to pay, and I always recommend it to people with perspiration issues.

You have have this claim:

* NikolaiVonToffel has had a divine/religious experience.

Can you provide evidence for that claim? Keep in mind that you've acknowledged that some people can be mistaken in these experiences. Going along with that notion, I put forth this claim:

* Experiences of divine/religious nature arise from the brain.

I can support this with a [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11328359) which traced neural activity during typical religious practices. I'm not saying that this in turn could not be caused through some divine interaction, but I'm also not saying that it is. I'm only claiming something for which I can back up with evidence.

Now a subjective experience might be good and sufficient for the perceiver, but it does little to say anything beyond the limits of their forehead to me. It might be true that a god of some sort is instilling you with divine inspiration, I don't know, but I do know that at the very least a brain is a big role in that and I don't see a logical way to go beyond that step at the moment."

Usually one pure defense item to round him off (Randy's/warmogs). Its all pretty tentative, ill build him slightly differently every game sometimes.

So yeah, it works really well because like i said gragas gets enough base dmg/stats to be effective with less ap. Also you are usually leveling w for defensive builds so mana isn't too bad. Also i usually run something like 0/27/3 to get the mana regen.

As for AD bruiser it works well, you spec for AD (hybrid pen works best here) ofc and get ravenous hydra for amazing clear and damage that synergizes with his free ad from W. Then usually build the same tanky items (iceborn/sunfire)."

justme753,relationships,1388785308.0,"My dad is a convicted offender - one victim/one time, and due to the circumstances surrounding the incident, I don't consider him to be a risk to re-offend in the slightest...

Despite my full confidence that he is not a risk to anyone, I STILL make it a point to let the parents in my life know about the history.  I live with my sister-in-law and she has an 8-year-old daughter.  She is fully aware of my dad's history and the details of the event - she's also aware that I don't consider him a risk, but she is equipped to make informed decisions regarding her daughter's safety.

The fact is, I would rather give someone the tools necessary to protect their child against an unlikely assault than to not say something for fear of causing a rift by speaking up - only to find down the road that there is a new victim due to my in-action.  I don't think it's necessary to tell your entire family, but telling the sister (and her husband) is.

That being said, I can understand why telling the sister is a scary thing... There will probably be some initial anger coming from her because she doesn't want to hear what you have to say or believe this ugly truth about her brother - especially if they're close.  I would suggest one of two approaches... 

(1) Invite the sister and her husband to one of your counseling sessions (if you are still in therapy) so you have a third-party mediator and they have someone they can talk to about any feelings that come up. 

(2) Have your sister with you when you tell them. Again, this gives a third-party to help guide the conversation.

But I would want it recognized that I know what I am doing in my areas of expertise, even if they aren't ""female"" activities. Like IT for example, my first degree is in comp sci and yet if I even mention to a guy that I have a problem with my pc they want to take over even though I know what I am doing (I have actually had exes break my comp when they tried to fix it when I was out).  
What do you mean about the commodity part?  I often wonder about the intimidation thing because I know a lot of women say that to each other to make themselves feel better about why the guy didnt call back etc, but on the flipside I have had guys try to forbid me from wearing heels because they say they are intimidated if I am taller than them....

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388785374.0,"&gt;I'm still not sure if the first part of my comment shows I'm responding to what you said because you didn't let me know if it was right.

Right about what?  Sorry, I'm a little lost.  I'm not sure what you mean by ""the first part"" of your comment, which I appear to have responded to.

&gt;As far as whether women are marginalized, could we not say that the very fact that I had to reference the difference between feminism being a philosophy to express the perspective of the marginalized, and you talking about feminism actually creating a marginalized mindset in women, explain how the views of the marginalized are still not being expressed clearly even by you?

No?  I'm really having trouble understanding the question.

&gt; That is what the SEP article alludes to, yes. That the criteria of impartiality used by many people attempting to describe whether there is marginalization doesn't take into account the perspectives of the marginalized and in fact makes those perspectives invisible, furthering the original issue.  I'd of thought that would be clear from the link and my summary. 

Honestly, I'm finding your comments almost impenetrably dense.  I'm really not clear at all what kind of a point your making or where any of this is going or to what purpose.  So I wanted to make sure.

&gt;Since this relies on whether or not Christmas should be represented at courthouses or in less obvious cases be being ""removed"" where the phrase ""happy holidays"" exists instead (which is inclusive anyway) then it is not like what's discussed. 

Your argument would seem to indicate the impartiality used by many people attempting to describe whether there is marginalization of evangelical christians doesn't take into account the perspectives of the evangelical christians and in fact makes those perspectives invisible, furthering the original issue.

I don't see what court houses and happy holidays has to do with it.  Those are merely some of the examples of marginalization that evangelicals point to.  How is [an evangelical christian acting butthurt over the supposed harm caused by a festivus tree](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2522024/Fox-host-Gretchen-Carlson-slams-Floridas-plan-atheist-Christmas-display-live-air.html) any different than [a feminist getting butthurt over the supposed harm caused by an 8-bit princess](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6p5AZp7r_Q)?

&gt;&gt;rape culture

&gt;You don't think there are more examples? 

I'm trying to figure out where you quoting me from, but I didn't use the phrase in my post.  So...?

&gt; a song that characterizes the way some men have categorized women (think the whole ""women have a way of shutting that whole thing down if they don't actually want it or didn't enjoy it"" thing) as ""you know you want it"" is insensitive towards women. 

What?  I totally did not follow this at all.  First of all, the line is not ""You know you want it"" it's ""I know you want it"" -- the it in question being Robin Thicke's body.  How does he know?  Because she keeps ""talk[ing] about getting blasted"" and ""The way [she] grab[s] [him]"" indicates she ""must wanna get nasty.""

You're literally describing a song that acknowledge that women have the same sexual drives, and the same right to act on those drives without apology, than men have as *insensitive to women*.

Have you ever even actually read the lyrics? Take away all the poetic license and boil the song down to its most direct meaning, and he's literally saying:

&gt;""Your last boyfriend put you up on a pedestal and treated you like a princess, but I know you're a liberated woman who wants to have fun and enjoys sex. I can tell from the way you keep grabbing me that you're into me, but you're worried about looking like a slut. Don't worry, I know you're a real person with real needs and I'd rather you be direct about what you want than confuse things by being coy. You're the most attractive woman in this place, and I'd be lucky to hook up with you, and I promise if you sleep with me I will give you the hot, wild sex you want, unlike that last guy who left you unsatisfied. I've got some weed, you want to get stoned?""

Goddamn, so misogynistic! /s

&gt;I don't think you've illustrated that feminism, feminists, or my take on either is nonsensical.

Well, I'm not trying to convince you, you're trying to convince me.  

And let me tell you, drawing random connections between ""Blurred Lines"" and the idiocy of Todd Akin while misquoting the lyrics of that song?  Not doing a lot to convince me that your position is not nonsensical."

Engaging in an MMF threesome as a woman tends to indicate a preference for a level of domination that most men have trouble providing by themselves. Engaging in a long term relationship with this type a woman is generally a bad idea, because it's harder to keep her attracted to you.

Engaging in an FFM threesome as a man, on the other hand, is usually indicative of an excellent ability to dominate.  For women who are attracted to dominant men, this is an attractive quality, and a man with these qualities will have an easier time sustaining attraction long term."

Cheesy as this is, I sometimes sit in my car or in a quiet space and rehearse things to say in confrontation based on what normally triggers said confrontations or triggers her narcissistic behavior.  The rehearsal makes it an instinctual response which helps me regulate my emotions.

Some of the ones I use:

""This conversation is no longer productive.  You aren't getting the satisfaction you want, clearly.""

""You're right.  I have nothing to add to this discussion.  I'm going to leave the room now.""

Sometimes it doesn't even have to be disarming.  A simple ""sure"" and a blank stare works wonders followed by just walking away.

pyralidae,thesims,1388785927.0,"The chemistry potions can only sold through the sim's inventory without the use of mods. Now if you are ok with using mods, here are some that help. This could get complicated.

You can use the Savvy Sellers Collection but only after downloading this mod:
http://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=517108

And the reason is the coding of the cash register and shelves of the Collection only allows objects from the buy mode to be sold. This is so the items never needs to be restocked, which if you used Open For Business in Sims 2 and liked that feature its disappointing.  That mod creates a custom code that can read by register/shelves where selling interaction takes place.

Your comment seemed to suggest that feminism was some kind of secret plot with a hidden agenda.  Which implies conspiracy.  I prefer to think of it as the inevitable consequence of humans being stupid, greedy, self-centered fucks.

&gt;Heh of course, one of the most famous first wavers' equality of unmaking married women as property and the herstory about it.

Look, I take the position (as did many Enlightenment philosophers) that the values of the Enlightenment are not gendered, and that women have the same rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness that men have.  And being consigned to an existence as a housewife does seem pretty dismal, and I don't begrudge women for wanting a fuller, richer life.  I would ask for the same thing.

I'm sure you can find all kinds of idiotic beliefs amongst the first wave of feminists, and yes the ""unpaid servant"" argument (which they still make!) is totally bullshit and always has been, but there were actual and real limitations on what women could do.  Those limitations don't exist anymore, but at the turn of the 19th century, they sure as hell did."

SlickKat88,conspiracy,1388786000.0,"1- Generally, the topic of distilled water and its relation to health arises after customers inquire about the PH levels of our water and all that we remove.  I'll advised them of the neutral 7 PH level, and go over what constitutes as an inorganic/organic dissolved solid/gas. Those who live in an area where the water naturally has more dissolved solids present will have shorter filter lives and run risk of pipe corrosion (as you mentioned), which can increase the TDS consumed to an even higher level. Those in coastal regions with high concentrations of salt have a TDS around 300. Some parts of AZ around 400-600. US average is 51-200. Max approved is 500 through the NSF/WQA. So, I will advise them that our quality is close to double distilled water without the ""flat"" taste. We remove anything inorganic or dissolved, and if the water filtered is municipally treated potable water, that means pure H20.  
  
2 - Yes, the water will absorb something from you. [It absorbs](http://www.durastill.com/myths.html) the ""rejected, discarded and unusable minerals and, assisted by the blood and the lymph, carries them to the lungs and kidneys for elimination from the body.... It doesn't leach out minerals that have become part of the cell structure, only those rejected"". It's possible to die or become sick from consuming water at a faster rate than it can be expelled, though the only point in which the water would absorb valuable nutrients/minerals from your body is if you were suffering from malnutrition and your body were burning it's own cells to generate energy to function. That is unhealthy, and water will only assist in what the body has already started.  
  
2.1 - Oh yes, various things both natural and unnaturally present in the water supply can cause corrosion of pipes. Lyme is a large issue in the south and explains a lot of corrosion issues in TX. The PH of our water is a neutral 7, the safest to consume. Higher or lower can be very dangerous for the body (hence avoiding drinking still water as water becomes more acidic as it sits). --- One of the big things about that site that hits me is that it is not the WQA or NSF, or FDA on that note. It's also like many others I see. She states that her son researched for and composed many of the articles on the site, so the credibility sort of falls for me. That's not to say it doesn't hold some factual basis, but it steers me away.
  
As far as taste goes, I actually do. It's not the minerals in the water but the amount of actual oxygen that we taste when we drink it. Sweet tastes are attributed to the iron in the water. The higher the level, the more iron.  
  
All that aside, I agree. Test your water people! TDS meters are easy and awesome."

So:

- Unless we first switch to an entirely carbon-neutral energy provision, the whole exercise is a pointless shirt pocket - back pocket operation.

- If we could do that, it wouldn't be necessary anymore.

- Worse, it'll be a net loss of energy.

- Even if that wasn't a problem, somehow we would need to generate all that energy *in addition* to our daily needs, *before* the greenhouse effect did significant damage.

That's the science. As for the social side: if we manage to get that much funding, we could just as well buy plots of land, grow trees, and store them somewhere. Boring and not as spectacular, but carbon sequestration is carbon sequestration. Alternatively, buy up coal mines and collapse them."

acsempronio,bjj,1388786174.0,"[No-Gi]

I train at a primarily KM gym.

My grappling instructor does a class once a week called ""End Game.""

A typical class is pad/bag strikes/kicks/knees for warm up.  He calls the combo, we execute, then switch.  Then he incorporates a closing technique for the strike warm-up we just did: could be an over under for control, could be a standing arm-triangle, could be anything that moves you from the ""red zone"" into the inner ""green zone.""  Then he adds in a take-down method to it.  Then he options an ""on-the-wall"" or ""against the fence"" scenario that is similar, but requires a slightly different approach.  Then we drill the stuff and some of us spar it.

He explains it to new students that we are ""using grappling to set up strikes and striking to set up grappling.""  My take away is that if there are 3 total options: defense from strikes, offensive strikes, and grappling for control, you are only allowed 2 options to use at any given moment.

Example: If we are both standing and in striking distance, I have two options: defend your strikes, and offer my own strikes.  The moment we start something grappling-related, I now have to stop worrying about hitting you and focus on not getting hit and controlling you.  Once you are controlled through grappling, I have effectively stopped any strikes from you.  Then, and only then can I now hit you some more.  

People who fail to understand this suffer with poor defense (getting hit), poor offense (hits aren't good enough), and even worse grappling (it's hard to control someone when your two hands are simultaneously hitting and defending.)

If your gym is offering this kind of training, take it.  Then learn the ""Gift Wrap"" technique.  I find it to be most effective in maintaining control, delivering strikes with impunity, and optioning to various submissions should striking become tiresome.

Funny note: The KM guys who come into our class from time to time suddenly realize that punching and kicking someone isn't as easy as their KM classes make it seem to be."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1388786217.0,"Sure, it has a purpose, but I wouldn't equate ""ends"" with ""purpose.""  They're similar, but I'm not sure I'd say they were interchangeable.  This is because the relationship is supposed to continuously produce whatever you're looking to get out of it, instead of some final consequence.  If it's happiness, the relationship should continue to give you happiness.  If it's sex, it should continue to give you sex.  By your own definition, once the relationship stops giving you these things, then how has it not failed? 

And also, I made a mistake in my last comment, and after rereading the definition, I'm going to go back to my Breaking Bad argument, which is more relevant:

&gt;not achieving its end

Wouldn't this mean that whatever it is, such as an undertaking, it is meant to come to an end, and once it does so, it has been successful?  For example, let's say my goal is to practice a song until I can play it from beginning to end without errors.  Once I accomplish that, I have been successful.  Long lasting doesn't apply, because that wasn't even a potential in the undertaking. That's why Breaking Bad works, too - it was supposed to end at a certain point, and it did.  Or let's say I want to build a space station out of k'nex - once I do that, I've been successful.  If I cannot finish, then I've failed.  But if I did finish, I've already achieved the final result - whether or not it's long lasting is irrelevant.  It's not even part of the equation.

&gt;But how can it be a failure if I went in looking tor something, and found it? That's success.

You can have successes and failures at the same time.  The guy who supposedly invented potato chips failed at getting back at the customer that was pissing him off, but was successful in creating a snack that became pretty damn popular.  You can have a relationship fail while finding what makes you truly happy - that's allowed."
RUN_BKK,Saints,1388786226.0,"Eagle fan here.  
Most Eagles fans already answered your question, but let me tell you a story of an Eagles-Jets game I went to 3 years ago (in Philly).  
I was sitting in the nosebleeds, where fans are the rowdiest. There were two Jets fans near me. The one in my aisle was a total shithead. He was talking trash to everyone around him, yelling at the top of his lungs. Most Eagles fans didn't even engage him, they wanted him to leave them alone. Every Jets score/good play he would stand up, yell, and jeer everyone on around him. By the 3rd quarter a guy behind him had enough of him and punched him in the head a few times (both the Eagles fan and Jets fan got ejected).  
Now, the other Jet fan was quiet and reserved. Sure, he cheered and clapped when the Jets did well, but he never tried to get in anyone's face. The Eagles actually ended up hammering the Jets this game so he eventually started sarcastically cheering for the Eagles. Everyone loved this guy. As he was leaving, people were going up to him and shaking his hand and patting him on the back.  
Moral of the story, don't be a dick a you'll be fine. I heard someone say make friends with the Eagles fans around you. That's great advice. If someone is being a dick to you the Eagles fans will have your back. As much as there are people who are assholes, there's the other fans like us who are respectable.

1. She should approach the neighbors with a dog bed and some blankets for the dog.  She should tell them that she decided to do something neighborly because she really likes the dog (or whatever sounds most plausible here).  She should not lecture them about the dog or tell them they are doing something wrong (even though it sounds like they are) because that might cause them to reject her gift.  

2. Anonymously leave a dog bed and blankets for the dog.  Leave a note saying it's from a local rescue or something.  Whatever she thinks will work.  Right now, the most important thing is keeping that dog from freezing to death.

Keep in mind there are taxes other than corporate taxes which nonprofits get out of paying.

In addition it keeps the nfl from paying taxes on league dues which it uses to fund low interest loans and grants for nfl stadiums, which would all normally be taxed (they don't spend all that money each year, they keep it, and in any case only legitimate business expenses would qualify. A preferential loan would not fit under those terms).

Drunk_Physicist504,LeagueofLegendsMeta,1388786331.0,"Well the ideal way to play Noct top would be to pair him with another strong duelist jungler (Udyr / Lee Sin). Push to turret during the 2nd wave and have your jungler wait in tri then ambush their jungler. You should still be level 2 when the opposing top laner is level 1 and has a wave full of minions to deal with. 

Once 7 or 8 mins rolls around, grab your jungler again and invade the opposing jungler at his top buff. Nocturne can ult from tri so once again you have a 2v1 situation where your opposing top laner won't be able to respond as quickly.

It's easy to say Noct would lose in a 2v1 scenario, but in a 2v2 he is quite strong. And the amount of wave clear ensures that you will pull jungler presence from other lanes or risk losing an early tower."

People will expect you to start learning the language of the region you live in.  Meanwhile, English will be fine if you are in a young, hip, urban environment and work a job in IT. 

Salaries depend greatly on the job. They aren't very high because of automatic deductions for social security and taxes. 

Belgians are people who typically mind their own business but are still friendly. There is some irritation towards foreigners, but that's mostly aimed at people who refuse to work and live on welfare.

His wife dies 2 years later at 67. She also worked 4 decades consistently. Where does all of that money that they paid into social security go? Where does all of the money that they paid into unemployment benefits go?

Sure, it's not a bottomless pit of money. However, there are many people (like my wife and I) that have been lucky enough to have worked consistently for close to two decades now (we're in our 40s). We've contributed into social security and unemployment. Where is that money going? And don't say that social security goes to pay the existing workers. There's supposed to be $2.7 trillion in SS right now, but our politicians have raided it over the years. 

So when that person is leaning on unemployment, s/he's first extracting money s/he put in. After that six months is up, let's assume s/he used up all of the money that person put in. Fine, let that person use the money I put in. Here's a novel idea. What if we cut our defense budget by 5% and use that money for the good old citizens of the US? 

Ultimately, I agree, we need more jobs, otherwise we're just delaying the inevitable. For many people, the skills that they have are for jobs that simply don't exist anymore. I'm not sure what the solution to creating more jobs is, but maybe we need our modern day Hoover damn. Maybe we need to put pressure on corporations that they can't get tax breaks *and* ship jobs overseas. There will have to be a multi-pronged approach, but it's clear this isn't 20 years ago. More and more, people are not finding work once the six months is up. Therefore, we have to change unemployment benefits to keep up with the times. Simply saying, ""Damn, you haven't found a job yet? I'm cutting you off!"", is only going to cause more foreclosures, which hurts all of us."

Vault-tecPR,worldnews,1388786444.0,"Although many of those are ongoing trials that are simply being updated and broadcast anew, you make a fair point--one which I *think* I agreed with in my most recent comment.

Of course, they don't address the differences between the U.S. and India with regards to what constitutes rape, nor do they match the sheer brutality of the most highly publicized cases in India (a 16-year-old being lit on fire; a woman's organs being pulled out of her), but they still stand as a collective example that the U.S. has serious societal problems of its own.

It's not a contest in my mind. I find it to be extremely disturbing when someone takes a position of moral superiority and says ""Indian society is fucked"" or ""all Indian men are animals""--both of which I have seen many times on /r/worldnews--yet I also find it to be extremely disturbing when someone affixes their blinders and wallows in political correctness. You don't seem to fall into either of these categories, but it's something to watch out for."

JustBitten,AskWomen,1388786474.0,"I dreamed that I had an alligator and that he lived in a pool in my yard. Apparently the alligator was unhappy, because the pool wasn't big enough. In my dream it was where the garden is so of course, the next second...there's a huge pool in front of my garage so naturally my pet alligator is finally happy! Yay!
And then it was time to go out. And how do you go out to run errands? A car? Public transportation? A bike? NO! You ride on your pet alligator. So me and my family of course got on his back and off we went. And in my dream I remember looking down and seeing we were really high up like we were on a horse. Totally normal! So the rest of the dream consisted of us zigzagging through traffic and passing by people like beep beep bitches, coming through.


Then once I had a dream that there was a big grid in my backyard. It was divided into 12 parts and I had to be very careful. Because the twelve parts were months. Actual months like on a calendar and if you step in one of them you will experience the weather from that month. I couldn't get out of it and I was pissed off because I have to stand here LIKE AN IDIOT. I'm dressed for warm weather and what if I step in, say...January and they won't let me get out (No idea who ""they"" are.). I'll freeze. And I guess there was a reason, like...someone could just push me so that's why I had to pay attention. I was just angry. Like wtf am I doing here? This is bullshit!


There was also one that was really weird because it was one of those that feels insanely real and you wake up all confused and just shaken.
It was about a year after my dog died and I dreamed I was walking around my house and then suddenly spotted my dog on the balcony. And I thought ""What? Why are you here? You died."" I felt a rush of happiness, just couldn't believe it. He's here. I missed him so much. This can't be happening but it doesn't matter,I'll get to hug my friend again. So I ran towards him, wanted to touch his fur but he moved away. And I suddenly got the thought that I shouldn't touch him and was confused. So he looked at me, and I thought ""He's just here to see if I'm okay and to take one last look at the house."" Then I felt what he was feeling apparently. And it was just calmness and happiness. So I thought ""He is okay. He is happy! He really did die, he's not here anymore but he exists somewhere and he's okay.
We just stood there together, and then suddenly he grew big wings. Really giant white wings, and he flew away and disappeared from my sight really fast.
When I woke up I was just weirded out. I felt like the spirit of my dog visited me in my sleep. I couldn't stop thinking about it even though I'm a person who doesn't tend to overthink dreams. Just an odd one that felt very real."

rottenborough,statistics,1388786502.0,"1. There are many possible causes for measurement bias in different ways, e.g. there's someone who prefers to use up the tp when there's not much left, there's someone who's actually taking whole rolls of tp (cardboard tube count doesn't work in that case). There's also the possibility that everyone is really regular and the tp usage happens to be in phase, but we can safely discount that strange circumstance.

2. Assuming unbiased measurements, the conclusion you'll be able to draw is whether you use more or less than the house average. You won't be able to know if you're using less than everyone else, or if one or more people are using more than everyone else.

&gt;Are men behaving so poorly these days that saying this has become 'business as usual'?

Some probably are. Some women are probably also saying it in a misguided attempt at either flirting or honesty.

&gt;And finally, at the risk of pot-stirring, what do you think hurts more, being treated as a sex object or a sex fiend?

Well, both suck pretty badly, but, in my opinion, someone can at least prove themselves not to be a sex fiend through their actions over time, but being a sex object is something that someone else can perceive you to be regardless of your actions and choices, so you have less say in it over all.

Don't get me wrong, I love providing.  I open doors, cook meals, kill spiders, open jars, change tires, do oil changes, etc., but that's because I WANT to do them and if I'm in a relationship, for the most part I'm WILLING to do them.

But a girl who asks for these things, the same things, repeatedly and consistently is a different story.  It's not the asking per say, it's generally that they don't know how and don't want to learn or don't feel the need to learn.  It's like, after the millionth time of having to open a jar of pickles, I get it, you don't think you're strong.  Why not work on becoming stronger?  My opening the jar doesn't make me feel macho.  More than anything it worries me about when you might need to actually use your strength to protect yourself.

ThoughtRiot1776,CampingandHiking,1388786626.0,"You really want fats.  Carbs and Protein have 4 Cal/gram whereas fats have 9 Cal/gram.  Calories are fuel.  I'm definitely not saying that you shouldn't have carbs or protein in your diet either. 

Copypasting:

I'm assuming you mean a backpacking trip since you posted here.

Breakfast:

* Oatmeal with nuts, seeds, and fruit mixed in for flavor, texture, and calories
* If I don't want to bother with cooking in the morning, just cold grains/oats.

Snacks:

* GORP/trail mix.  Cheaper to mix it yourself.  Granola, oats, nuts, seeds, some tasty bits like chocolate covered raisins, well baked ""cookies"" (my friend's mom makes awesome ones, I should get the recipe), PB filled pretzels, dried fruit, etc.
* bars, PowerBar and ClifBar usually.  If I'm pressed for space and weight, I might buy ProBars or the ones that that Hammersomething company makes, but they're pricey.
* Gatorade or another type of sports drink mix.  
* Jerky- expensive unfortunately unless you're making it
Lunch:

* Tortillas to put stuff in
* Peanut butter- make sure it's the fattiest stuff you can find.  Calories are important.
* Nutella- even more calories than PB and delicious.  Mixes well with PB.
* Cured meats, I usually get salami
* Cheese- has to be hard.  It keeps well over a week.  Maybe a little sweaty, but no big.  Delicious too.  80 Cal/ounce is pretty damn good too.
* Dehydrated beans- makes a good burrito with the cheese
* hot sauce or something for flavor in a small container.  Those TSA plastic containers work fine.

Dinner:

* Olive Oil.  It just doesn't get any better than this when it comes to calories.  200 Cal/tsp iirc.  And it makes your food taste better.  Specifically, it's great for the pasta sauce (replaces butter) and you can add it to the instant mash too.  
* Pasta.  I usually buy this stuff from Safeway called Acini, which is just little pasta pellets.  Cooks fast and it packs good too.  I buy those Knorr pasta packets or something similar.  They taste fine with some olive oil and water instead of milk.  When buying pasta, you don't want shells or stuff that has dead space in them.
* instant mashed potatoes.  Delicious.  Even more so if you add some cheese to them.
* the deydrated beans again
* Couscous.  
* Then something nice for dessert like some Chips Ahoy or those Mothers animal cookies or whatever you like

A few notes:

You will need to repackage a lot of the stuff because couscous and pasta comes in boxes that have a lot of dead space.  If you're really pushed for space (and I often am because of bear cans), you can prick packaging with a needle, squeeze the air out, and then put some tape over it.  It saves a pretty significant amount of room when you have 7 days of food.

Cygnus_X,Bitcoin,1388786741.0,"&gt;That does not matter when you have a business to run. 

Ok, lets play this out.  Let's assume you run a business and you accept BTC due only to the lower transaction cost of BTC over credit cards.  If you are running your business correctly, you will make a profit on this transaction.  Now, you have converted part of your BTC immediately to USD (through bitpay or similar service to pay for expenses in USD as you suggest) and you are left with a choice.  Do you convert the remaining BTC to profit in USD, or leave it as profit in BTC?

I am betting that many companies elect to retain a small portion of profit in BTC as both a hedge against inflation and as a bet that others behave in a similar fashion.  If this happens, the supply of BTC goes down, and the value goes up.  If many business elect to accept Bitcoin (which I believe they will), and if they all behave this way, then the value skyrockets."

viceywicey,AskMen,1388786767.0,"I would go so far as to say the choking and red-eyed/teary eyed is more out of TOO much control as opposed to a lack of control, be it unconscious or otherwise.  I'm mostly like this.  When my grandmother passed away, I only cried twice: once when the docs told me she was brain dead and I said my goodbyes and again when I delivered her eulogy.  All other times, stone-faced, no emotions.

To give you parallels to your work example, I work in a place where patients are generally low-income and have a sense of entitlement (""we should get free care and the government should pay for everything yada yada"").  I feel for these people but they can be really in your face on account for the the fact they don't like to hear ""no.""  When I get into confrontations where they call my humanity into question and call me a disgrace of a person for not giving them free health care, my eyes will water and my throat gets choked forcing me to seethe the words out between my teeth.

For me, it's less an issue of trying to control these moments, again, it's more of an issue of too much control.  When I get into these confrontations, I'm pissed.  Pissed that they think they have the right to say such nasty stuff to me.  Pissed that they are entitled to be ""right"" because we are still customer service.  Pissed that they want to dump their problems on me like they're the only ones with problems.  Pissed that I can't do anything but say, ""sorry for your troubles, but we can't help you.""  In those moments, there's a flurrying explosion of emotion that wants to out, but can't. The result is the red/teary-eyed cracking voice and desire to cry, but being unable to do so which makes it all the more frustrating."

AnyelevNokova,Parenting,1388786828.0,"Because we're insecure. 

We all want to be good parents. We want to do what's best for our child. The problem is, what's ""best"" changes seemingly on a daily basis, and honestly, there are very few things that are truly black and white on what is ""best"" when it comes to parenting. What might be ""best"" for one family might not be for another, and it often boils down to individual circumstances that, obviously, most people outside of the family in question might not be keen to.

But we still want to be the best and do the best that we can. And when we see someone else making a different choice, it's very easy for us to say, *wow, how misinformed that person must be! I'm doing the best thing that I can for my child. Maybe that person should do what I'm doing.* And when we're rebuked, we become offended because we think what we're doing is best. We were just trying to help, right? Why can't that person accept that what we've done has worked for us, and therefore, they should at least *try it* before shooting us down? Our personal research and doctor told us that X technique, X product, X lifestyle choice was best for our family; who's to say it's not for everyone else? I've told that person that what they're choosing is not the best, because we've been told that what we've chosen *is* best. They're choosing not to do this, so therefore, they must not be as good of a parent as I am. 

And this whole thought process, this judging, makes us feel better about ourselves. It's usually the most smug people that are the most insecure. If your parents ever told you that the bully was the biggest coward of all, it's the same concept. We judge because it puts us, in our minds, above that other person. With the constant bombardment of information from the media and other people, it's easy to become insecure in your abilities as a parent and, thus, as a human being. Judging other people on their choices makes us feel a little bit better about our own, and for a lot of people, it's very difficult to step back and really put themselves in another person's shoes, or accept the fact that we might not know everything about another person's life and why they've made those choices. What might be right for us might not be right for them, but it's easy to snap to a judgment that they're incorrect because we don't have all the information."

One thing I find helps to try and get them used to talking to you is to do something together. If it's at a party ask them for help cutting lemons or making drinks. Be creative with it and try and talk to them about the task in hand. Add in some questions and conversation while you are focussing on the task. It takes pressure off them as you aren't 100% focussing on them and allows them to get used to your presence.

It also give you inspiration to maybe tell a few stories about what happened last time you mixed drinks etc. this gives them more time to be accustomed to you and get comfortable with their surroundings.

meantforamazing,changemyview,1388786940.0,"&gt;Maybe it's because I'm someone who readily admits when I don't know how I feel about something, and I almost never say anything I don't mean.

Not everyone is like this though. Sometimes people get caught up in the moment, only to 'come back to earth' later. Sometimes people are proposed to in front of HUNDREDS of people, and they don't want to embarrass themselves or the person they are with by saying no.

There are other people, who, at the moment they become engaged, feel they are 100% committed to getting married. But shit happens. Sometimes, their engagement falls through because of something outside of their control. Let's say that cheating of any kind is a deal-breaker. Their fiance(e) cheats on them. They break off the engagement. 

Is the engagement that was broken a fault of the person who didn't cheat? Should they feel wrong to want to break an engagement when the circumstances have changed so dynamically? Do they deserve to be distrusted because they respect themselves enough to get out of a relationship where they don't trust their partner?

You say that you are very cautious to tell someone you love them. Not everyone is like this. Some people fall in deep, and hard, and are blinded by love. Their S/O proposes, they say yes, and then reality hits. They back out.

Shit happens, and honestly, breaking off an engagement is much less expensive than going through a hypothetically expensive wedding and divorce. Breaking off an engagement isn't EASY either. Imagine you are engaged, and your entire family and the family of your fiance(e) are super pumped for the wedding and the grandkids that may follow. You come to the realization that you don't want to spend the rest of your life with this person. I wouldn't want to be in that person's shoes! To not only have to break up with someone you care about, but also have to break the hopes and dreams of your family and friends.

Are the above reasons valid reasons to distrust these people? I don't think so."

Nothing, but genetics controls physiological features which are culturally associated with the constructs of race.  Sufficiently blend the genepool and it will become impossible to categorize by race, as the predominant physiological features types will manifest uniformly across the population.

&gt;Race... get this... get this, race is totally a made up thing. That's right, people just made it up. It's called a ""social construct.""

Yeah, I know.  This is why I find racists so silly.  It's not even a real thing! It's totally an illusion.

&gt;Now get THIS bit of tid-bittery. Gender is also a social construct! Fudgecicle bywombly am I for real? Darn skippy I am.

Sure.  Totally.

&gt;And as it turns out, in our day and age, in our modern civilized American society, feminine form is seen as less then, as worse than, and as an 'other.'

I disagree.  That's an entirely subjective opinion, which you have been indoctrinated to cultivate through confirmation bias.

&gt;But if you find what I said to be really insulting and dismissive of your arguments, keep in mind, you're not making arguments. 

Yes, I am.  You're being dismissive because you have no response to them.  It's insulting.

&gt; Everything you say rests on a false premise. You are not interested in **real actual feminism.** Just your narrow minded view of feminism that is easy to pick apart so long as you ignore reality.

There he is!  It just wouldn't be a discussion of feminism if someone didn't invoke the No True Scotsman fallacy.

Tumblr feminism is real actual feminism.  The months of bullshit on reddit about Robin Thicke's song is real actual feminism.  Anita Sarkeesian is real actual feminism.

Just because you can't defend that nonsense doesn't mean it isn't a real, actual, genuine, truly occurring, not imaginary,not illusory examples of feminism in action.

Like all feminist apologists, you want me to believe that all the self-identifying expressions of feminism that are clearly visible are not real, and that there is a secret hidden world of feminism that I just can't see.

This is a classic argument.  It generally takes the form of ""Who are you going to believe, me, or your own eyes?""

If you're wanting the NT scan/bloodwork, you'll have to get it immediately after you're first appointment because I think it has to be done by 13 weeks.

You're conflating a number of things here.  

I am a person now but I was not a person when my body began to exist.  When my body began to exist it wasn't even a body, just a clump of cells.  Life doesn't have beginnings, it's a process.  In fact, I'm part of a chain of life extending into history and it's only because my brain formed successfully that I am able to think thoughts like 'I am'.

welcomebutcarrie,TwoXChromosomes,1388787601.0,"

I keep seeing these posts about young women getting body-shamed by their families, and I don't get it. Your mom probably has your best interest at heart, but honestly, even if she is completely *driven* to say something, she should just let it go after saying it once. 

As far as what you should say to her, I wouldn't stress about trying to change her viewpoint. Letting her know how her words make you feel may be a good first line of defense. 

I think your own words sum it up quite nicely:
""I understand that you say these things as warnings, because you want the best for me. But even though I know that people who are closer to the physical ""ideal"" are often judged less harshly than people who don't, when you say these things it really just stresses me out and lowers my self-esteem. If I decide to change, it should be on my own terms and for myself, not because I keep hearing other people's opinions about how I look.""

For what it's worth, I was constantly given shit from my parents about how I should do things in life differently. I'm a bit older than you and have had time to move out and distance myself from my critical and neurotic mother. I recommend becoming hyper-vigilant about how you feel in these situations, then focusing on how it's her own issue and not yours, and finally dismissing physical appearance as an issue that she struggles with. It must be stressful for her. She may be projecting, she may have had a bad experience related to body image. The point is, the sooner you can process her repeated criticism as *her* insecurities, the sooner you can forgive that behavior and have control over your own self-esteem. "

silverionmox,changemyview,1388787634.0,"&gt;But the population is growing. Is our current agriculture system both sustainable and scalable to the future?

No. Therefore it's pointless to do the same thing we have been doing but on a larger scale and with even more interdependencies.

&gt;Do you think we can de-industrialize farming without decreasing the yields? Aren't yields the whole point of industrial farming?

No, mostly short-term profits are.

&gt;And another typical use is the opposite. The tool cuts both ways.

8/14 uses are to increase pesticide and chemical use. 3 out of the 4 most commonly used plants are to increase pesticide and chemical use. As the example of nosocomial infections shows, indiscriminate use of poisons will lead to resistant varieties of pests, sooner or later. But because mass industrial agriculture is all using the latest, newest, identical crop that resistant disease will sweep across the world.

So there's definitely reason for concern until they stop cutting aimlessly."
Amonette2012,LifeProTips,1388787649.0,"There's a difference between 'false positive' and 'reading the test wrong'. Also any medical condition that might cause you to produce HCG does so at levels that are undetectable. 

Additionally, what some people might consider a false positive - i.e. 'I took a test and it was positive, then I turned out to be not pregnant' - what's actually happened is the test has picked up a non-viable pregnancy that the body then aborts naturally at a very early stage. 

Edit: Also an expired test is still highly unlikely to give you a false positive. And knowing something about the manufacture of these tests, the batches are checked and the chances of a faulty one getting onto the market are so small as to be negligible."

I think that one of the reasons why being transgender is longer listed as an illness is because there's nothing inherently harmful about wanting to live life as the opposite gender.

backfromretirement,femalefashionadvice,1388787806.0,"Great work! I love this. I'm just going to add a few little things I've learned working as a flight attendant about packing in general.

Most airlines will allow you to check a bag for free, but if they don't, don't bother. Pack a normal sized roller board suitcase (21-22 inches long, no bigger) and bring a big backpack or other squishy bag for under the seat in front of you. This is absolutely key, that's an FAA rule- two carryons per passenger and one must fit in the seat in front of you. Don't try to get away with putting two bags up in the overhead. 

In your roller board pack your shoes and clothing that could wrinkle exactly like this guide says. If you know that you'll have access to an iron (most hotel rooms will have them) then roll your clothes up nice and tight and you can fit way more. In my carry on once I brought two pairs of jeans, four pairs of leggings, five pairs of tights, seven different tops, four skirts, two sets of workout clothes (shorts and a tshirt), and three sweaters along with a week's worth of underwear and socks all thanks to the rolling technique and the iron in my room when I arrived. But you don't need to bring that much on vacation! I was going to flight attendant training and was going to be living in a hotel setting for five weeks so that worked for me. 

So after you pack your roller board, you have to pack your other bag. This is where your laptop and everything miscellaneous should go (books, kindle, extra socks and underwear, medications, snacks, and accessories like jewelry). Don't waste space in your roller board where you could squeeze in another pair of shoes or something. You should also throw in your toiletries bag, just make sure that everything that's liquid is in its own little bag or you will end up with lotion everywhere. Trust me. If you're going to be somewhere for a while, just buy shampoo and conditioner and anything else (toothpaste, hairspray, etc.) there. Don't try to bring giant bottles of stuff, it just takes up room (and you can't carry on anything larger than 3 oz). If you are checking a bag and want to bring your bigger bottles of liquid, go ahead and put it in your checked luggage, but I cannot stress enough, make sure it's all in baggies! 

I'm going to copy and paste here something I wrote earlier about skincare on an airplane. Lubriderm is your BEST friend. Seriously. Apply liberally. I bring a bottle of that and all my makeup in my personal bag and leave it where I can reach it during the flight. Get a little 3 oz bottle and fill it with the lotion from the big bottle so you can bring it in your carry on. I reapply my makeup every few hours after wiping my makeup off with Neutrogena's makeup remover wipes and putting on more lotion. I also keep nail clippers with me because my nail beds get really dry when I fly and I get hangnails really easily, but I don't think you're allowed to bring those on the flight. Other than that, Chapstick and wearing fuzzy socks are your best ways to be comfortable on the flight.

Other random final thoughts: Don't wear tight clothing during a long flight, you will bloat up due to the change in pressure and you'll be SO uncomfortable. Wear your heaviest jacket and use it as a blanket (if you're sleeping, buckle your seatbelt over your jacket so the FAs don't have to wake you up). Don't wear jewelry and go through security, you'll just have to take it off if something sets off the metal detector. 

If I think of anything else I'll add it here :)"

everybell,TrueReddit,1388787825.0,"This is interesting, I've had a completely different experience with Pandora, but in a different context so that may reveal why. We use a wifi player at work to play Pandora stations, and I believe we have a business-class account so that may change which songs are allowed to play. They're all artist-seed stations, and we have a lot of similar genres represented across different stations. 

What I've found is that when we start it up on a different station, it will play new songs for about an hour, and then it's back to the same 10 songs per genre. If it's on any jazz or soul artist station, from Nina Simone to Otis Redding to Ella Fitzgerald, we're going to hear four different versions of Beyond The Sea play repeatedly. Sometimes the same song will play back to back.

Naruze,depression,1388787862.0,"I never managed to fit in when we moved to another country. I was young and was heartbroken having to leave my home, my school, my dogs and especially my friends all behind.

I became really insecure and very shy, stayed inside most of the time, started stuttering and was bullied because of this,  my appearance and my behaviour in school.

At first I laughed it off, but it always hurt and reached the point where I was too scared to go to school, I became sick (or at least I thought I was), I hated myself, started self-harming, my parents divorced, my dad was very abusive, my grades got worse and nearly everything that *could* go wrong went wrong.

I never had many friends and I spent most of my teenage years at home on the Internet. I don't really regret it much since I met a lot of amazing people here and I had a lot of fun playing online games etc. but   it was only then, when I didn't have to  interact with the *outside world* that I felt okay most of the time.

It got really bad in college where I skipped school loads, my grades got worse and I didn't care and my family situation was very messed up. I had lost the few people who were close to me in real life, I was feeling more and more grossed out by myself (specifically my body) and the self-hatred and self-harming became so much that I actually tried to kill myself once but I even messed that up.

All in all I think that many factors came together, but it's the fact that I am very deeply unhappy with who I am as a person. I sometimes just end up crying and shouting at myself basically, I sometimes really wish  I just wasn't born."

shalashaskatoka,bestof,1388787935.0,"Well the problem is this. In any significantly  large population of women, you will find some who like people with shitty personalties. They are just out there due to statical chance. Thats why Red Pill *can* work. Let me explain.  
  
  
  
If you are actually are "" too nice of a guy"" and by that I mean someone who puts women on a pedestal and worships them, then yes, you are going to have a hard time attracting women at all. A ""Nice guy"" isn't assertive nor is he someone with any convictions or passions. Thats hard to be attracted to. 'Nice guys' are so focused on trying to attract girls with their 'personality' that they don't actually develop themselves into interesting people to be desired in the first place.   
  
Now if you are  somewhat snarky and generally a bit pushy(Red pill), you exude some negative traits(Like being a douche), but also show very positive ones as well( Confidence, Goals, Ambitions,etc). Those positive traits make you attractive to more women, where as  being a ' nice guy' made you generally less attractive. To use numbers just for the sake of illustrating the point, lets say that 80% of women wont date the 'nice guy'. However, the 'positives' that the red pill guy exudes makes it so only 65% of women wont date him. A vast majority of women still wont date either one of these men, but the asshole red pill guy still has a better shot. Thats why guys without proper guidance think that it works. Therefore,red pill ideals *can* work on the right type of girl. But, there is one thing red pill never talks about. What *Type* of girls do their antics attract? Dime pieces to ""smash"" or a girl you take home to meet mom?  As a man,I personally don't like the way redpill thinks, but I do see how it does work.  
  
  
Ever wonder why that girl you liked in highschool/ college ended up with that total asshole of a boyfriend? Clearly, there was something she liked about him, even though his personality was awful. What was it? Well that asshole boyfriend had a ton of friends and people respected him. However, he had those friends because lets face it. Its way easier to be friends with an asshole in school  rather than abide by your own standards and deal with his shit. If you are friends, at least  he wont abuse YOU that much. So being part of the asshole boyfriend crew makes your life easier. Repeat 5-6 times and the asshole boyfriend now has a crew that makes it look like he has social skills and power. He had power, but not much else. That girl with the awful boyfriend you liked was interested in the 'strong man' at the time. This situation  exists all the way through life. Its all about the kind of girl you want to attract. Redpill just focuses on attracting girls who like assholes. They do exist for some reason."

Opening up a relationship (which is what you're doing when you allow your SO to sleep with someone else) is not black and white. Just because you agreed to a fantasy that you never thought would come true a year ago doesn't mean you're actually okay with that. Most people make these lists under the idea that it could never actually happen. You can't treat sex with someone other than your SO as, ""You said awhile ago in a joking way that I could sleep with this person that didn't even seem real to you! If you don't let me do this than you're a liar!!""

If your SO is about to sleep with someone and you're not comfortable with it, then you have to express that. You are allowed to change boundaries. Just because you were okay with someone awhile ago doesn't mean that's sticking throughout the whole relationship. Unless you make it incredibly clear that *it will* happen given the opportunity (not just some fantasy or joke), you can't expect them to be okay with that. 

Now, if your SO called you up and said, ""Hey, I have this opportunity to sleep with [famous person] right now, can I do it?"" and you agree, you can't call that cheating.

I've never said otherwise. They'll have to do even more, though, otherwise we're not getting there. At least they don't have the sunk costs in inefficient settlement patterns and infrastructure that was state of the art 30 years ago, so they're lucky in that regard.

&gt;Also, you're really showing your ignorant racism here. China is not filled with poor peasants... actually quite the opposite: millions of people crammed into dense urban populations. Shanghai alone has double the amount of people than New York City.

China's city population only exceeded its rural population in 2012. I don't really see how it makes a difference where exactly those poor people live: China can't reach the same per capita emissions as the USA, not even in some cities while the rest stays poor, or we're fucked.

Of course that goes against a sense of fairness (if the USA was allowed to they should be too), but the climate doesn't care about fairness. We pass the threshold, we get cooked... no buts!

* **I LIKED *Rome*. What I say below doesn't change that.**

* **The show is more accurate than most movies that are ""based on history.** 

* **Obviously, there are spoilers. I've only seen most of the first season, and I'm basing this off of what I've seen.** If you want to continue watching the show in blissful ignorance of the stuff that makes me go ""Well that's not quite right..."", then please, don't read any more! 

---

Okay, now that the prelims are done with, I'm going to address the idea that the producers did their homework regarding the Roman army. Honestly, it's better than *most* (They're not wearing *lorica segmentata*, for one thing), but again, it's not quite right. I love how they showed the discipline of the Roman army, however, again, it was not quite right. For example, Pullo, when he breaks formation and strikes a superior officer, would have been executed on the spot. No questions. The Roman army had *extraordinarily* strict discipline and specific, harsh laws regarding their behaviour. Pullo should not have survived the first episode. Speaking of the first episode, the show depicted a battle - however, I'm not sure WHAT battle it was, even though they claim it was Alesia (By Vercingetorix being captured afterwards). The Battle of Alesia was a totally different beast - it was a desperate siege, with the besiegers themselves being besieged, and an incredible display of Julius Caesar's brilliance as a commander, as well as an indisputable example of Roman engineering at its finest. I didn't get that from the show :/

Then, one little nitpick that would have been a HUGE deal. Caesar (and others) rode through the Roman camp. Again - seems like a funny thing to nitpick, no? The thing is, *no* one, not even kings and commanders, were allowed to ride through the camp - it was considered extreme bad luck, and at least one Roman loss that I've read about was blamed partly on a couple of individuals riding through the Roman camp. Caesar, a man who publicly based his reputation on his fantastically good luck, would never *ever* have committed such a *faux pas*. 

Oh right. Speaking of Caesar and *faux pas*-es. Another thing he would never have done is shown that much favour to the Thirteenth Legion over all of his others - his favoured legion was the *Tenth*, and he spent the vast majority of his time with that legion, as opposed to the others. The *Tenth* went with Caesar almost everywhere he went (The only exception being the one legion he took with him when he went to Rome, crossing the Rubicon - which WAS the *Thirteenth*). When Caesar fought the Alexandrian Civil War, the *Thirteenth* wasn't originally with him, as shown (poorly) in the show - that was the *Sixth* and the *Twenty-Eighth*. But they did get the armour right, and it's absolutely possible that they rotated their ranks like they showed in the show, even if we have no proof of it! :)

---

Now, on to non-army things. As /u/Tiako noted so well [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/w6ih7/how_accurate_is_the_tv_series_rome/c5ap81l), with broad strokes, the show is pretty solid. Showing street life is fantastic, showing the colours of the city, rather than the blase, stolid marble that we're used to is utterly gorgeous. But then there are the little things - and I'll just give you a couple of examples of those.

First of all, Caesar's...uh....sleeping around was rather well known. He'd slept with half of the married women in the Senate, it seems, and Servilia was Cato's (Who was FAR too old in the show, and would NOT have worn a black toga in the Senate) half-sister. Also, she had a daughter - who Caesar also slept with. Cato's wife? Yeah, Caesar slept with her too, I believe (He divorced her for sleeping around). Caesar's legionaries sang songs about how much Roman tax money was spent on Gallic women. My point to all of this is that *Caesar's wife would not have been surprised at his propensity to bang everything with boobs and two legs.* She certainly wasn't about to divorce him over it. 

The one big one that ground my gears a bit - they got housing completely wrong. The vast majority of Romans would have lived in houses called *insulae*, which were essentially big tenement complexes. Rooms were small, shoddily built, and they were generally five stories tall or so. Contrast that with Lucius' lodgings - the room is relatively comfy, larger than you would get from one of these *insulae*, and, most of all, it had something that those tenements would NOT have had - a kitchen. Funny how we just take that bit for granted, eh?

And then, of course, the excessive incest and random sex between Servilia and Octavia, Octavia and Octavian, Atia being batshit loony, etc etc are completely ridiculous. If you have specific questions about what you're looking for, please, feel free to ask them :) The issue with this question is that it's extremely broad - but in general, this all sums up to **NOT ALL THAT ACCURATE.** Compared to other Hollybood butcheries? It's amazing. Compared to reality? Not all that true.

jezztek,loseit,1388788372.0,"Howdy, 

My digital scale needs to be calibrated each time you move it. Basically I set it down, step on it just long enough for the digital display to ""wake up"" and immediately step off it, and wait the 5 seconds for it to go back to sleep. This calibrates it, so then when I step back on it again it shows a consistent weight.

On mine, when I step off it that first time it doesn't roll back to 0.0lbs instead it rolls back to 5.6lbs before it goes to sleep. So it appears that until it is calibrated it overweighs by 5.6lbs, and if I didn't calibrate it I'd get results almost exactly like yours, except the first weigh would be 5.6 pounds heavier than the others, rather than 5.4. With the rest being all the same.

So yeah, looks to me like that's the problem. Trust the post calibration numbers."

Chill Cpl tells us both to take out the trash, and maybe take a long while of it. So, at 2200, we both carry out one trash can out to the dumpster, dump it and then wonder how to kill time. i just so happen to have a ping pong ball in my pocket. i decide we should play baseball. so, i throw the ping pong ball, and he was supposed to hit it with the trash can. well he threw the trash can up in the air at me. i figure i can catch this fucking thing. i look up, and all i see is a street light and im blinded by it. i manage to udder ""fuck"" before the fucking thing slams into my god damned face. busts my brow open and bleeds like a son of a bitch. other PFC is freakin out, so i told him to go back to the guard shack to get some paper towels or something because i dont want to bleed on our freshly field dayed floors. when i got back the Sgt of the guard was not pleased. about this time is when i understood the poster from MOS school that said ""killin time kills marines.""

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388788683.0,"&gt;You're claiming to have a level of exposure to feminism that would put you in at least 90th percentile of the general population, and yet have never met or read one who wasn't a ""braindead nincompoop?""

Okay, you're right.  What I have observed is that there is a very strong correlation between identification with and embrace of feminist ideology and braindead fuckwittery.

It's a lot like Christianity.  The more fervantly you believe, the dumber you are.

&gt;Do you think everyone who disagrees with you is stupid?

No.  Some people disagree with me because I'm talking out my ass or I'm grossly misinformed.  But it's very easy to tell when I'm talking to someone who knows more than I do and is disagreeing because I'm wrong, and when I'm talking to someone who disagrees with me because they don't want to bother thinking and considering my point of view.

One of the reason it's easy to tell is because ideologues, regardless of their ideology, argue in specific patterns.  There is a structure common to all ideologies, and once you know it, the disagreements become very repetitive and boring.  

&gt;Or is there something special about feminism that makes 100% of those who agree with it idiots?

Ooh, good question.  Yes, there is.  It's an ideology.  And John Adams was right when he said that ""Ideology is the science of idiots.""  Robert Anton Wilson was right when he said ""Ideology is a poor substitute for actually thinking.""  

Ideology makes people dumb, because ideological systems convince their adherents that the ideology is always its ideal form and never its actual form, and that to question the ideology is to be an enemy of the goal of the ideology, which is always construed in the most positive manner possible.

So for ferminists, the goal is ""equality,"" the enemy is ""patriarchy,"" questioning feminism is ""misogyny"" -- or if you're a woman who doesn't think feminism is accurately describing your life, ""internalized misogyny"" -- and anyone who does not support feminism is an enemy of women, as feminism is ""only"" the desire for equality for women.

You can see that argument unfold on reddit every time someone is critical of feminism.  It's an ideological defense mechanism that prohibits questioning and rewards dogmatism.  It's why ideologies create idiots. "

Seems like you're fairly racist overall


* You're lumping ALL black people into the ""work in the heat or die"" category

* You're lumping ALL white people into the ""cold weather get chubby"" category

* You're lumping ALL asians into ""tiny body, must be smart"" category

You need to learn more about the world, and realize that you've been fed a load of shit. 

Spit it out, and taste the truth ok? What you're parroting is [Social Darwinism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism), and it's a pseudo science. Snake oil. 

The differences in anatomy from geographic regions are negligible. 
The back of your canine teeth are slightly more flattened than curved - does that make you better or worse at sports? 

C'mon, man - if evolution worked the way you claim, and it shaped policy, you'd see Irish Americans as migrant workers and mackerel fisherman.

Now there's a porn filter, that's all fine and dandy. We don't want little Timmy typing ""penis"" into Google for shits and giggles and suddenly finding himself in the middle of a hardcore porn site, now do we?

But what if they start adding small things to this porn filter? Animal abuse videos? Videos of people being shot?

To protect the children, of course. That makes sense. You can simply opt out if you do want to see it!

But then they start adding filters to more stuff. Some obscure websites of local communist parties for example that clashed with the police a couple of times. We all know communism is bad, right? No need for impressionable kids to be subjected to vile thoughts about a system like that. When they're old enough they can decide for themselves. Anyone else that does want to see it can simply opt out, right?

But are parents that opt out of the filter bad parents? Why would a good dad or mom want to view videos of people getting shot, look op communistic parties, or watch porn? Are they influencing their children with vile websites? Every child nowadays has a smartphone. Parents can't always control those. 

Mandatory filters are now in effect for all homes with children in them. It's for the wee little children, right?

Half the nation cannot research communist parties or watch porn.

s54b32dd,nfl,1388789083.0,"I think the Priefer reason is ithe reason for ""why now"" more than anything.

Ultimately, Kluwe clearly isn't happy with Priefer, and wants to keep him from being successful in the league. Beyond that, I do think Kluwe has respect for his teammates, as I believe him when he says he didn't come forward earlier out of respect for his teammates' responsibilities as players.

The Vikings are done playing, and will most likely have a new HC before the Super Bowl. If Kluwe waits until the playoffs are over, there's every likelihood that his words fall on deaf ears with Vikings leadership, and the Vikings organization hires a coach who doesn't mesh well with Minnesota's stance on gay marriage (leading to PR problems for the organization).

I don't like how little evidence there is for either side of this argument, and clearly football players have a brotherhood/camaraderie that you're not going to find amongst most coworkers. Kluwe knows that if he doesn't say anything, no one else will, so he's willing to ""become the villain"", so to speak, and do what he thinks is right (which, for the record, I believe he thinks he's doing the right thing).

Just a thought; the only issue that the KFAN crew appeared to have is the way Kluwe went about things, which I agree with as well. Kluwe clearly has no inclination toward the ""football brotherhood"", which is made clear in the way he discusses what it's like to be an NFL player with a former LB on the radio interview. As a result, he didn't feel the need to follow the unwritten rules of avoiding conflict during the season. I think this, more than anything, is what got him fired; the contractual obligations were a convenient excuse, but I think that if Kluwe were ""just"" a solid punter, he would have been able to stick around to close out his contract. Making waves during the season for anything but good on-field performance always puts your job in question in the NFL. If Kluwe was so concerned for his job, he should have been more cognizant of that fact."

Secondly I'm not so quick to judge and initially defended BWL, this is based on what I've been hearing from multiple sources, what I lived through and the outage map from the utility that DID get everyone's power back on.  I live in the Michigan county hit hardest by the storm.  The city I live in was like a bloody war zone.  I also traveled around Lansing and it wasn't worse than what I saw at home and inbetween.  I understand there is nothing on the ground that the CEO can do and I've got nothing against the guy for taking his Christmas vacation, but that's no the point I was trying to make anyway.  My point was that one company was able to restore an entire state while the BWL was unable to restore one city.  The BWL is also not held to the same standards by the Michigan Public Service Commission that the private providers are which may have contributed to the issue.  Given that they haven't released a good reason for why it's taking so long in Lansing but no where else it's rather curious and I think people are totally justified in thinking that going 11 days without power in subzero temperatures is unacceptable.  That's all I was saying.  Being a whiney CEO blaming rabble rousing cunt about it is not, which I don't believe I ever suggested.

Honestly, I'm of the mind that local governments should mandate buried power lines.  Yes I'm sure the initial cost is quite high but the saved cost of not having to have a ridiculous emergency response every few months should make up for it eventually and I'd gladly pay a little bit in property tax or higher energy bills to ensure I don't lose power again."

Sometimes the relationship moves far faster than the comfort levels of the parents, and I have to ask you: have you ever brought home someone who your parents were racist against? Like, straight-up ""I will pretend you don't exist and will suffer shame in silence when talking to the rest of our family and friends"" racist? 

Not to mention, do you realize that introducing someone to your parents in Korean culture is a pretty Serious Thing^TM ? 

You don't get to choose your parents. Sometimes in  a culture as xenophobic and homogenous as Korea, people don't behave the way you, as an American, expect them to, even if they're in their 50's and 60's. Dealing with this kind of situation requires the juggling of many concerns, one of which is the intermittently spiking blood pressure of your Korean parents. 

While getting someone to create proof of a fake ""friend"" is pretty over the top, I understand *exactly* what sorts of pressures this couple is facing and am not going to judge them for being driven to such desperate lengths.

TiburonVolador,Spanish,1388789223.0,"Ah, the beginning of r/Spanish's very own circlejerk.

Listen, all accents are lovely when spoken consistently and with a conscious effort towards clear communication. I do hope those saying Chilean is best are not trolling, while it is indeed fun and distinct (one of my favorites) it is infamous for how distorted it can become.

I suggest you use the accent best suited for your needs and setting. If you like Castilian, go for it! If you want to have a go speaking another one, feel free. It can be very sensitive to context. For example, I wouldn't speak like someone from Spain too blatantly among Mexicans, or make a speech in a very distinct Porteño to a group of Cubans. Work your needs, find a middle ground. Use vocabulary according to needs, avoid using terms you know will not be initially understood by a certain group. Why say 'carro' to a Spaniard when you may well know that you ought to use 'coche'? Worst case scenario you may come across as arrogant, specially if it leads up to an actual conversation on what accent is “better” (it's happened to me, not nice.)

That said, as a native speaker, my best advice to someone speaking it as a second language is that you should dabble as much as you feel comfortable doing it, nobody will judge you and it's fun, if you do eventually settle on a Castilian accent, then by all means that is the best accent, because you chose it."

I have seen this topic crop up more and more in various conversations. There is no counter in most dialogue when people begin suggesting a male should be beaten/fought/be exposed to violence. I find this deeply troubling, even if it's proposed in a joking context. While I hope I handled this conversation well, I'm curious for input on how to handle future dialogues and perhaps better ways to interact in conversations that consider the subject of on-male violence so acceptable.

**EDIT:** To add, the comment *""You can totally see the girl's tits in the cover photo.""* should have been highlighted gray: it is the same individual critiquing my sense of humor earlier in the discussion. Sorry about that mistake!

* Wash them in petrol to see what sort of metal they are.
* Check your filter for other bits.
* Clean it out, fit a magnetic sump plug, refill the oil and run for a couple of hundred more miles. The point is to see if anything more comes through the system. Obviously there's a bit of a risk, but I don't think that it will go bang soon.

there are policies to prevent it as much as possible but if someone wants to take advantage of a helpless person, they will find a way. most caregivers know to protect themselves from baseless charges (work in teams, so you aren't alone with a resident, etc.) but those who don't care or who want to take advantage will find a way.

as for having cameras, you can't have cameras in the resident's room without their permission (even MRDD individuals have privacy rights!)

Rhode,polyamory,1388789380.0,"My ex was married and poly when we met.  I wanted to be with her so I had to accept polyamory.  It was relatively easy for me, it was something I had always been interested in but didn't ever really think was possible because I just didn't know anyone that was into it.  We were together for a little under a year and it was mostly good.  It ended because she's bipolar and I lost patience with her behavior.  The final straw for me was that she repeatedly lied to me about sleeping with other guys, which was exasperating because she had my permission to do it so there was no point in lying.  In spite of that,  my perspective had shifted so much at that point that I didn't think I could go back to being monogamous.  

Right around the same time I started seeing my current girlfriend.  She was introduced to polyamory by her exboyfriend, he was in a group relationship.  It was not a good experience for her, the group was dominated by a girl who was not cut out for the whole thing. She was incredibly jealous of everyone and had a litany of bizarre rules that everyone had to follow, so after a while my girlfriend bailed.  

We both still believed it could work though, so that was what we agreed on when we started seeing each other.  It's been about a year now and it's been great. There have been challenges, of course, but we've dealt with them and our relationship has developed quite nicely.  We've both been outside the relationship and we've been able to support each other in those efforts, which was felt really great and only made us want to keep going with it.  The whole thing has been an incredibly positive experience for us both.  "

The scene with the low level Irish guys in the warehouse... In the scene Archer (aside from the homicidal tendencies) has exactly the same outlook and humour that my friend had (""I'm going to do everything in my power to beat this thing,"" that kind of attitude).

I said that DRE (I even put it in all caps when I said it for emphasis that it wasn't my opinion) took it one step further. I'm not a violent person, I don't believe it's ever the answer. I don't think what dre did was wrong because it was a woman, I think it was wrong because it was violent. My point is that it's strange that he can rap about killing people, he could actually do it and nobody would care. But if he hits a woman suddenly he's a terrible person. I'm saying that we're looking at someone who had a violent past, taking one incident and saying it's the only one that matters. The other make good songs but this one in particular is bad and he should be shamed for it. Like I said, if you don't like him then don't like him for all of the violent shit he's done, not just this one incident. My comment was extremely anti-violence, don't put words in my mouth. I'm saying violence is always bad, and that women aren't a special case (although it's naturally bad in that case too). Please don't put words in my mouth, I would never encourage hitting a woman, or anyone. If you read my comment again I'm sure you'll see that what you said is not my opinion.

TLDR: violence is bad, Hitting a woman isn't bad because it's a woman, it's bad because hitting anyone is bad. "

I think we're talking on two different levels about what problems are easily solved and which are not. 

Having ""more data than you can imagine"" isn't the issue. Making all that data difficult to untangle is the issue. If they could untangle it all, they'd simply track them all to individual IP addresses and send out arrests for all those who participated.

In your original post, you inveighed against the wrongs of ""sleeping with the enemy,"" despite the fact that *your own husband is technically of a different racial background* (by saying that your husband is ""interracial,"" I would guess that you mean to identify him as ""biracial.""). You are now claiming that you can ""hold your opinion and still see that people are human,"" even though you were previously arguing that the other races are basically evil and cannot be negotiated with. 

Your dialogue sounded eerily similar to the talking points that I've heard from some of my more black nationalist acquaintances; therefore, I addressed my post to you with the assumption that you supported a bigoted ideology of racial supremacy. Apparently, my assumption was inaccurate, but this does not add validity to your argument; if anything, it makes me really question how much of this you actually believe.

And finally, I am many things, but ""idiot"" is not one of them; I am not ""nitpicking"" at each point of your argument (I was attempting to deconstruct/analyze it), and my differences with your ideology run far deeper than simple semantics.

It's a long story, but I'll try to keep it short. Part of it was really that we grew apart-- but she wasn't accepting it. We had previously been extremely affectionate and made sexual jokes all the time and stuff, and I gradually grew out of it... but she only got more intense, like she sensed I was moving on and she was in denial. It got worse when I had a serious relationship later in life and the two of them could *not* get along. Not getting along is one thing, but stuff happened like we got drunk together (I had 11 drinks and she had 2) and she kissed and licked my neck. Not cool.

She also talked about people behind their backs constantly, including our mutual friends, and could be pretty vicious about it. I found out (as you often do with those types) that she was talking behind my back as well, bad-mouthing my relationship (surprise, surprise) and my school (she went to a fancy college and I went to an online one). 

Finally I called her up and told her I couldn't talk to her anymore, she was out of my life. She lost it, called my entire family crying (it was like 11pm), etc etc. 

I kept the phone call very short and to the point, so I wrote her a letter later going into my decision and sent it to her.

We've just started talking again now, years later, but I am taking it very slow. For obvious reasons.

I'm not saying the medical community is wrong, I just think you're misinterpreting what the things you are reading mean, and misunderstanding the kind of numbers we're taking about here. Statistically speaking, true false positives - ones that aren't caused by side effects of medication, misuse by the user or actual non viable pregnancies (those are actual positives rather than false ones after all) are rare enough to be insignificant. What I'm trying to say is that the test itself, if done correctly, will not detect a pregnancy that is not there unless there is a particular set of mitigating circumstances, and these themselves are reasonably rare.

I am hopeful that laptops and tablets will enjoy better low-power, integrated solutions. Another reason desktop GPUs have been getting bigger and more powerful too, is the move to higher resolution monitors. A decade ago, 1280x1024 was a pretty standard resolution for computer monitors. Now the ""standard"" is pretty much 1920x1080, which is nearly twice as big. 2560x1440 monitors and larger are gaining popularity and a decade from now, 4k resolution might be pretty common. This just makes ""gaming"" graphics requirements even higher, on top of the general improvements in visual quality. "

At the end of the day, it was a battle between his selfishness and his righteousness. His righteousness didn't win out until he realized he had already sacrificed his paycheck.

On the one hand, it would have been more noble for him to step away from the game, citing the treatment by his coach. On the other, he was earning a boat load of money to take the abuse. I personally see Kluwe as a selfish ideologue who hoped to use his minimal fame to promote an idea he believed in and potentially springboard him to a post-football career. All in all, his position isn't wrong, he's not a bad person.

I would say the only way to get close to this would be to do this geographically. Make the coasts extremes on all social issues and make the north and south the extremes fiscally. Each state is assigned the grade of extremity and you end up with a grid. You choose after that where you want to live. We have mass migrations throughout the country.

luculentlady,changemyview,1388790130.0,"Yes, traditional couple's therapy doesn't require someone to go through extensive training to be a counselor. It is entirely based on drudging up the past and giving you a 'safe' place to sit with your spouse and argue back and forth...it even gives you a foam bat so you can beat each other up, which is SO wrong. I believe in an 'althernative' marriage coaching which focuses on teaching the couple 'new' habits to implement with each other before even hearing what their problems are. This is very effective in ALL the couples I've met that went through coaching. 

To answer your other question, I believe that it wouldn't be a waste of money anymore than spending money on an overpriced lawyer to make sure you get that car or house or whatever else one might care about more.  Naturally people don't want to go to therapy because they don't want to face the problems they're walking away from that's why... but like garnteller was saying...identifying the problems in the marriage ought to be the first step and then learning to table them or eliminating them should be the first step...

Wouldn't you agree that if two people fight a lot were told to stop fighting and put these issues on hold for a little but then practice better habits like once a day complimenting each other, sending a random gift once a week etc. just doing 'healing' things then come back and deal with the issues.

[The wikipedia cite which says 99% seems pretty convincing](http://www.thebodypro.com/content/66547/prep-pk-modeling-of-daily-tdfftc-truvada-provides.html). Obviously you should still use a condom, and yes, just like any other drug, there are people with allergies and side effects.

Edit: Yeah, so if you read the source I provided, it comments on those past studies and points out that they quite likely have flawed methodology. 

""In some studies, daily Truvada dramatically reduced the incidence of HIV infection, especially in high-risk individuals, (by 42% in MSM in the iPrEX study) but produced conflicting results in other studies (notably the FEM-PrEP study in heterosexual African women).
**All studies have proved complicated to interpret due to the high rates of self-reported adherence but the likely very low rates of actual adherence demonstrated in PK sub-studies finding low levels of tenofovir and FTC in both active and placebo arms. The projected efficacy of PrEP increased dramatically when PK results were taken into account (to 92% in iPrEX).**""


Edit 2: Yeah, you actually have to take it for it to be effective. To me that doesn't seem like a very deep criticism of the study."

Dantilli,introvert,1388790173.0,"Yeah, taking it in small pieces is probably the best way to go about it. Try and work the little things into habits one by one. Give him clear examples as to what more he could do instead of just ""doing more"". Give an incentive in some way, preferably not money, try and be as creative as you can. The best way would be to really think about something small that he would REALLY appreciate. I know it's hard beause you may feel he is indebted in some way to you because of how he has been acting. But he doesn't see it that way, untill he can understand you point of view properly he will need some inscentive.

Try and thank him for the things he does, instead of just calling him out on the wrong, encourage him to do them more. This will help show him you do have respect for him, and what he does, but try and show respect in other ways too. Maybe explain things more than you normally would, letting him understand more. Don't do it in a condescending way, but because you think he might be interested. Instead of completely closing off the world of your work to him, as you probably do from the need of peace and quiet, maybe try and open it up to him. If he has some idea of what you're doing, maybe he'll understand more about WHY you need quiet. Again don't be condescending, be supportive, and maybe teach him a few things if he is interested.

Something I do a lot is timetable things. Maybe setting up a timetable for cleaning and a timetable for the times you need a little bit of quiet for work. That way he's clear about what is necessary and when. This also reinforces the fact that you need the time for work and you're not just sick of his company. Don't forget to timetable the stuff YOU need to do around the house too, try and make it as fair as possible. If he sees exactly how much you do he might also WANT to contribute more, but that's a dream situation right now. A little bit of structure goes a long, long way.

In the Lemondogs situation, the team Sinners never Sleep qualified for the LCS, and signed up with LD, the organization. Thus pretty much giving the spot to LD. When the original LD roster left, they left their rights to the spot behind.

In Alternate's case, their team qualified, but decided to make their own organization, and found Alternate to sponsor them, keeping their LCS spot in their own organization. Now the team will rename, but the organization and team will be the same. "

This is a great time to let your kid know that some folks will try to use science to convince them that skin color can tell them something about a person... ""Asians are better at math, Black people are better at sports"" ... and that's just not true. 

The only thing skin color can tell you is how much sunscreen that person will need at the beach - the darker you are, the less you need. 
Even dark black people can get sunburn, though.

So, back before agriculture, evolution favored some types of people in some types of environments.

By favored I mean ""those people had more children live to adulthood, who in turn had more of their children living to adulthood, than other people in their community""  

In European mountains, people gradually got paler over generations.... because when you're far from the equator you need to let the sun soak in. Vitamin D production needs it. 

In South America's mountains, people got paler over generations.... because when you're far from the equator you need to let the sun soak in.  

In Mongolia and China's mountains... guess what? People got paler over generations.... because when you're far from the equator you need to let the sun soak in. 

As far as [Epicanthic folds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicanthic_fold#Geographic_distribution) (why Asian eyes are 'creased') they're not unique to Asians.

mrpoopistan,TheRedPill,1388790279.0,"I disagree with this idea.

Women are capable of love, but it requires a lot of shepherding to get them to the right place. Frankly, ""the right place"" is something that most men would consider to be ""a dark place"".

That's the difference. For whatever fucked up reason evolution made it so, an attractive man putting a woman in an emotionally dark place instills love in her. A woman will fight tooth and nail for a bad boy who she's afraid will leave her -- and she endlessly blames all the other women gaming for him by calling them homewreckers.

I think it's hard for us as men to see because 1) we're not fans of being put in emotionally dark places 2) we generally see a woman first for her physical form and second for her personal energy 3) we tend to cling to those impressions long after everything is completely shot to hell.

moonfall,AskFeminists,1388790589.0,"Ngl, this is a very unusual assumption on your part, OP. Asking for directions isn't something people typically receive as a come on–– unless you're dancing seductively, licking your lips, or doing something else ~sexy~ while asking? Idek. (In which case most people would probably think you're more than a little eccentric as they back away slowly.)

The fact that you think asking for directions could be seen as hitting on someone makes me think that you must assume that all men and women –regardless of who they are– have inherent sexual tension, and that all heterosexual men are automatically Old School Possessive™ of their girlfriends. If that's the case, then I'll be the first to tell you: It's not a realistic assumption, and rather more one that reflects a projection of your personal attitudes about heterosexual relationships and the women and men in those relationships.

The other vibe I'm getting from this question is that you might think (or like to think) of yourself as first and foremost a hot-blooded and sexual heterosexual male (if you are, in fact, male), and because you perceive your sexuality to be a prominent or possibly *obvious* part of your being, any woman (which you seem to perceive to be inherently sexual) that you come into contact with automatically becomes an object of sexual interest by virtue of her coming into contact with *you*.

Which again, if that's on-target... idk what to say. I wouldn't say that the behavior and perception's morally ""wrong"", per se, but it's definitely degrading to the woman (and man she's coupled with, but in a different way) and a factor that's limiting your ability to accurately and flexibly perceive the realities in front of your face. (One possible alternative reality being that both people in the hypothetical couple are just people, and are probably more curious about why they're being approached by a stranger and what you want than worrying over whether you're suddenly going to break down and start frantically humping the woman's leg.)"

If it's in one gear only, this could be a broken dog on one of the gear pairs - this can happen if you do clutchless shifts. Fixing it is a major job as you have to completely dismantle the engine.

Same is happening with D2 and D3

I would not be surprised if the same happens with D3 and D4

The series is constantly changing, each numbered entry changes tons of stuff compared to the previous game, they don't want to repeat themselves, considering that the game industry keeps releasing numbered sequels to many known franchises with few changes I like that each entry in the Diablo franchise is extremely unique

Maybe D4 will be more traditional, who knows, all I know is that I want D3 to be as unique as possible"

Also, $5/mo doesn't get you your own server in the truest sense of having a single machine to yourself. At the volume of traffic they're pulling, they would need to look into have at least one good, true dedicated server along with some serious CDN stuff hooked up to lighten the load.

All things being equal (which they apparently no longer are) hosting with WP is the simplest and most anonymous solution.

Yeah, I scratch my head at the relative lack of technical implementation in the manosphere.

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388790885.0,"&gt;When was the last time you heard someone talk about a male politician's clothing choices as if it was affecting their run in the office[?]

Rick Santorum and his fondness for sweater vests.

&gt;...or criticised for seeming too emotional while making a speech? 

John Beohner cries a lot.  It's widely considered very inappropriate and off-putting.

&gt;When was the last time you heard male politicians being judged because they don't have a family [?]

Ralph Nader, 2000 elections. Also the last time I recall a candidate not having a family. 

&gt;...or don't spend as much time with the family they have?

I have never heard a politician of either gender be criticized in this way.

&gt;Basically being a woman means you'll be taken a lot less seriously if you try to prove yourself professionally.

Best not to even try then, right?  I mean, if I was a girl and you told me all of that, I'd just give up.

&gt;Aside from people writing somewhat melodramatic declarations like ""The decline of men"" etc where have you seen people giving a rational treatment to men not being able to have it all?

But men don't have the choice you are discussing.  Men don't get to choose between work and family.  Men work.  It's slowly becoming more acceptable for men to stay at home and be domestic, but that has more to do with the changing economy.  But its universally understood that there is a trade-off involved, and that being domestic means giving up a career.

Nobody talks about men having it all because men aren't suffering under the delusion that having it all is possible.  It's why [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqwKfgLaeA) is so damn popular. Everyone identifies with the theme of the father who is so busy supporting his family that he never gets to know who they are.

&gt;I think the stuff you're mentioning like SRS, the Tumblr SJ movement and Anita Sarkeesian are actually quite niche communities and differ a lot, you can see feminists critiquing Sarkeesian, SRS being flabbergasted by something on Tumblr etc. If you ask someone on the street I'm sure they won't have heard a lot about these things. Then again, I'm not even touching Jezebel here, which is obviously being vaguely feminist in the search for cash.

And every Republican I've ever talked to insists that Republicans don't have anything against gays and that the homophobes are an irrelevant fringe.

&gt;I'm not saying there aren't many feminists who think being feminist means putting other people down or battling the ignorant like a valiant knight (to get glory and/or validation), but I think a lot of modern women who identify with feminism don't really speak about it...SO these people are basically feminists...

Ahh, I see.  So the **real** feminists are the ones who don't identify as feminists except when trying to turn minor frustrations into politically charged injustices, and the people who identify fully as feminists and present themselves as speaking for feminism and are deeply involved in feminist activism are just the lunatic fringe and not at all representative.

Have I got that straight?

&gt; people saying that there's some stuff that's wrong and maybe we should do something about stuff like this!

I'm very confused.  That's a billboard for [this website](http://www.womenswallofhonour.ca/en/home/default.aspx), where people can pay to post a dedication honoring the achievements or influence of a woman they admire.  Why is this something we need to ""do something about?""  Is honoring women bad?"

I feel like there should be more information on **how much** you should drink, or how to drink responsibly -- seeing larger or bulkier friends drinking twice as much as you and not being intoxicated as fuck can lower your inhibitions to drink more. And that's not a good thing.

CyberBlaed,australia,1388791194.0,"I worked in that section of the industry myself for 5 years while I obtained my certificates.

My position was a assistant manager to a small PC shop, managing 5 people which was nice.
Competition was our shop (the longest standing one) a new one popping up down the road and just 3 shops down from them was another PC shop.

Competition was welcomed when it came in because the longest standing one prided itself on service and the quality of it, I admitted when I was wrong (I was well versed but you are always learning) and never charged customers. Many of the customers loved that honesty.
(Why bite the hand that feeds you?)

Only recently mid year, 2013, the farthest shop away from us closed its doors and folded, they were there for 1 year.
Leaving just us 2 in the town.
The other is keeping afloat with its net cafe making a majority of its income. For us, it hasn't changed with pride and service.

Things to be mindful of: in the first 6 months are the hardest, rent and other outgoings are what kill you, rent being the biggest.
I had thought about getting my own PC store, even maybe buying the one I worked for because when I came in, its finances were red, raised it to black and then into the green in a matter of months.

It is hard, you can do it but be smart with your money but as the above say, retail PC services aren't really profitable, however our 'charge them till it hurts' method worked very well, but you must garentee the work no matter what.

Maybe I'm gabbling on now sorry.
Its a gamble to jump into PC now, but I'd say branch out to some specialized neich service and you should be fine.

I am still passionate about the PC market so if you have any questions feel free and I'll help where I can. :)"

Lesbian_Drummer,TwoXChromosomes,1388791413.0,"Because a few people have asked about it:

My mom had to be induced, because she was having mild contractions, and my heartbeat was getting weak with each one.  I was also two weeks late - was actually supposed to be a Christmas baby - and clearly very comfortable sitting *right where I was*.  But I had to come out.  So she goes to the hospital and has terrible labor, and they shave her and do the episiotomy and all that shit they did as a matter of course in those days.  And my father goes... somewhere.  I think she once told me he went to a bar and was there when I was born, but she didn't focus on it because she chose not to.  It wasn't about him, or the fact that they had just reconciled after almost her entire pregnancy apart.  She just sat in that hospital bed with me, nursing me for the first time, and she said I opened my eyes and looked up and stopped nursing.  Then I put my hand on her face, like, ""Oh, it's you.  There you are.  I know you.""  And then I went back to nursing, staring at her the whole time.

I don't remember what she said about how long the labor was, or who came to visit when.  I know my older brother was with her parents (btw, my grandma was the first to call me this morning - entirely fitting), and my dad didn't wander in until later, and everyone came in and overwhelmed her in that way that happens.  But for a little while there, it was just her and me, getting to know each other, and she forgot about my dad and the painful back labor and how much it was going to itch as her pubic hair grew back, and all the other things with pregnancy.

My mother wanted me so badly.  She and my father tried for years to get pregnant with me, and it finally happened, just before they separated for a while.  They reconciled right before I was born.  When she left my father, her friends encouraged her to have an abortion, because there was no way she could take care of two children when she didn't even have a HS diploma.  She smiled and nodded and didn't do it, because she wanted me and had been trying to have another baby (both of them hoping for a daughter) for five years.  I mention this because she got to make that choice, even if, all things considered, it was probably not a great choice *in that moment*.  But she didn't regret it - and appreciated that it was her choice to make.  But it is good to know, a great comfort, that she wanted me that badly.

She loved and accepted me as I came out of the closet; she welcomed my wife in with open arms, even doing all the work on her dress the day before our wedding; she was looking forward to grandchildren.  She was the best mom any of us (myself and my three brothers) could have asked for, and my brothers and my stepdad and I - as well as my wife and my friends who were essentially like god-children to my mother - all miss her terribly.  She will be the person I try to emulate as I step into the next relationships journey (parenthood).  This Christmas was really hard.  But we got through it, and my siblings and my stepdad and I are all stronger for having come together and experienced that pain together.  Especially because her death was kind of a whirlwind thing - she wasn't sick for a long time, she just had a really bad migraine that ended with her bleeding into her brain, it was very very sudden - and this was the first time all of us were together since the funeral.

I miss her so much.

Sigh_No_More,TrollXChromosomes,1388791516.0,"I think the ABSOLUTE worst is when the women who don't experience mood swings and depression criticize other women for using it as an excuse to do whatever they want. And then as a result, a lot of men believe it and think all women who say they're emotional (or get emotional) because they're PMSing are just manipulative liars.

Like, I'm sorry I can't stand to be around people for 2-3 days every month. I am really, really trying to be pleasant. But I just want to be by myself, and if that is not possible, I am going to avoid talking to people because things that would normally be kind of annoying are going to make me irrationally angry. I am not just using it as an excuse to treat people like crap and get away with it. Believe it or not, I don't actually *want* to be angry and depressed. And I don't *want* to tell people that I'm not in the mood to have this discussion right now. And I don't *want* to start crying in public. 

If someone is being terse and grumpy and says, ""sorry, I'm having a really terrible week,"" people say they're sorry and leave him/her alone. If someone is being terse and grumpy and says, ""sorry, I'm PMSing right now,"" (not that it's even socially acceptable to say that in most cases) you get a bunch of people saying she's just being whiny, or making excuses, or they assume that none of her feelings or reactions have any validity whatsoever, or ""PMS ISN'T EVEN REAL, I READ ABOUT IT ONCE."""

Maybe he's hanging out a lot at his ex's because now they're back in town and he can see his son. Granted, the fact that he flat out lied about his whereabouts to you and his friend makes this seem less likely.

Since you asked specifically how others would handle it - something along the lines of, ""Listen, you think I'm being insecure, but I know that you weren't with John last week. John asked me how the movie we went to was and why you weren't answering his texts on the night that you told me you guys were hanging out.

And really, when Davies and company buckled down and said ""we're doing a love interest,"" it would make the most sense to go with the only other character that's in every episode- Rose.

Let's extrapolate this concept to vehicles.  You shouldn't buy a ready-made car from a reputable dealer and manufacturer.  You should build your own car and mine your own resources for it.  Don't buy pesky bulk steel and rubber for those tires.  You dig it out of the ground yourself, that's how we did it in my day.  Don't rely on an existing computer system to control all the bits and pieces of the car, you should code that yourself.

I realized I was so afraid of being alone, and being rejected, that I was allowing myself to be treated this way. I had lost respect for myself. I used sex to keep people around. Because hey, what was 15 minutes of sex if I got to feel connected to someone for five minutes afterwards? To me, then, it was almost worth the trade. Except I felt like crap twenty minutes after when I realized I was no longer connected to them. I kept using sex as a way to connect with someone else in an unhealthy way.

I realized I needed to connect to only one person: myself. Honestly? I don't even know how I've managed to get there. Running, I guess. It makes me happier and has showed me that time by myself is a good thing, a productive thing. 

I want you to know that there is someone out there that you are going to connect with. And it won't take sex for you to feel that way. Most importantly, you should not feel ashamed of yourself for having sex. Negative feelings will only reinforce other negative feelings. If someone is making you feel negatively about yourself, you need to realize it and cut that tie (as hard as it may be, because they are a temporary connection that you enjoy).

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388792028.0,"&gt;You didn't say where, so I don't know where to start re-explaining it for you. Why don't you say what you do get.

You seem to think that feminism is about representing the experiences of marginalized people, and that anyone who disagrees that women are marginalized is like stupid or something, and wrong because of postmodernist babble.

&gt;The part about slut walks before thicke. Are you really having trouble, our discussion has had an order since my first comment.

Yeah, editing my comments down to one word, or substituting them whole cloth with one word, is confusing.  It forces me to scroll up and down a lot, and makes it really hard to understand what you're talking about.  It's actually really obnoxious.

&gt;The festivus tree is inclusive, it is part of a celebration of Xmas. 8-bit princesses have no redeeming qualities towards women, marking the character as entirely weak and in need of saving.

This pair of statements is just blowing my mind.  The choice to render Christmas as Xmas when discussing how evangelical christians see themselves as marginalized and under attack, that's...wow.  I really hope this is some sort of brilliant parody/trolling/mind-fuck sort of thing, and that you're totally having a go at me for laughs.

And then the second statement, it's like...wow.  Just wow.  I can understand why you wouldn't want to come back to this, I wouldn't want to have to defend that assertion either.

&gt;The idea that a woman would need a man to feel better about how they've been treated over their gender is insensitive towards women. 

Okay.  And that has what to do with anything?

&gt;You made a claim, forgive me for assuming your claim about nonsense wasn't also an attempt to convince.

I don't bother to try to change the minds of people who believe in nonsense, as you cannot reason someone out of a position that they did not come to by means of reason.

I mean, you just said ""8-bit princesses have no redeeming qualities towards women, marking the character as entirely weak and in need of saving."" This is the product of a long string of completely irrational and nonsensical assumptions, and I seriously doubt anyone who could say something like that seriously is going to be talked out of their position.

That's pure articles of faith sort of stuff.  I'm not going to try to convert you away from your religion."

But with so much at stake (reputation aside, there's possibility of a libel lawsuit, as hard as those are to win) it seems insane to issue hollow accusations like these just to scrape together some money and fame.

antisocialmedic,inthenews,1388792229.0,"&gt;I don't think that women should be excluded but I also think it's a bad idea to lower training standards to accommodate people who would otherwise be unqualified

And I agree with that. I have always said and will continue to say that *all positions* should be open to anyone able to perform the necessary tasks that the position requires. 

If there are women who can join the infantry, that's great. If not, that's fine too. 

Of course there is also the idea that the way the military functions is changing, and perhaps some of the physical standards need to be (and apparently are being) reevaluated. If they find that they need to be changed due to innovations in technology that make certain tasks easier, that's great. If not, that's fine too. 

I think we will eventually reach a point in technological developement for the military (and currently physically demanding jobs in the civilian world) where sex really won't matter so much. That gap is already starting to be bridged to some extent, but we obviously aren't quite there yet. 

I have never served in the military, but I am/was a female firefighter and I got a *lot* of flack for it. 

There were some physical tasks where I just barely surpassed the bare minimum required (the same minimum was applied to both males and females). Oddly enough one of those tasks involved scaling ladders and had nothing to do with my strength or agility and everything to do with my fear of heights. And some tasks involving lifting very heavy objects were more difficult for me. There were also some physical tasks where I beat out a fair amount of my male counterparts. I was actually pretty good and dragging people to safety and active fire. I digress. All of the same arguments used against women in the military are used against women in the fire service.

But in this day and age, fire fighting equipment is much more lightweight and compact and it is much more practical to have female firefighters. If anything, we're awesome for scaling unstable roofing to provide ventilation (we tend to me lighter weight and less likely to fall through/cause collapse) and are smaller and can fit into tiny spaces the big burly guys can't. It takes all types. 

Edit: but I still maintain that a woman in her late teens or 20s should be able to do at least three pullups. It's really not that hard if you just put in the proper effort. Once you can do one pullup, increasing the amount is pretty easy. "

So when they are depressed after the break up they have that period of depression just like anyone but instead of dealing with it and working their way out of it, what do they do? They slap on a happy face and lie through their teeth. ""I'm fine! I'm so much happier now!"" And they keep that happy face on day after day, only allowing it to crack among their closest and most trusted friends. So to us and by all outward appearances, they are happy. 

Us men are great at swallowing emotion, but we are not so great at hiding it from ourselves. We know it's there and we fight to keep it there at the pit of our stomach. It sits heavy and cold reminding us every second that we are miserable. So we sit with this pained grimace on and ,as a polar opposite of women, we only let a smile crack for our closest and most trusted friends. But then it returns and there is stays until we sort of forget that we were ever sad to begin with. And all that pain sits there, still buried under that callus of forget.

redwhiskeredbubul,changemyview,1388792474.0," People in high school lead artificially structured and constrained lives. They have to be in school, they have to do certain activities, and most importantly they're forced to be in the same room with each other all the time. For whatever reason, this situation lends itself to the creation of arbitrary social hierarchies: it's the same in the military, in prisons, mental asylums, and so on. 

The kinds of social hierarchies that exist in adult society in general (actors, businessmen, lawyers, etc are high-status) are not as rigid as, say, jocks vs.geeks, and you can opt out of them. In fact, many women do. Many women don't want to date lawyers, businessmen, etc. In my experience, the strongest preference they have is usually to date somebody with a similar career to their own.   

The reason for this has to do with what it means to become an adult. Adults are basically free in ways that high school students are not,  and have different kinds of responsibilities. One of the most important responsibilities is taking care of one's own interpersonal relationships. Most adults would rather do that by making things easier and more predictable rather than going for the 'best' that they can get, especially as they get older. "

madepenn,AskReddit,1388792535.0,"Most of my family is not as intelligent as I thought they were when I was a kid.

My dad turned out to be a bigoted moron when it comes to homosexuality. He made a big point of how it was a bad thing for all of us that my cousin went to a ""homo parade"" because ""She has our last name."" He has no idea that I was at that parade with her and had been going for the previous 3 years. I lost some of my respect for him that day.

My grandma also turned out to be more backwards than I thought she was. She speculated that the dinosaurs died when Christ was born. When another one of my cousins married a mixed race girl, she said she wasn't surprised because he was always such a nice boy. My grandma insinuated that marrying this girl was an act of charity, and she expressed her relief when their child was born with lighter skin.

On the bright side, my mom is secretly a badass. She contributed to a book about feminism and the Mormon church that resulted in six people being excommunicated in September of 1993 (they're referred to as the ""September Six""). She wasn't one of them, but she was brave enough to put her name on her work, while many others submitted anonymously.

At a minimum, vebent was extremely foolish. Sorry, sending money via money order is essentially sending it via cash. And Toyota was taking the money out beforehand? Opening up a checking account doesn't mean they have to have access to that checking account. You can do that if you want or you can simply send them a monthly check.

This lasted about a year. Then he finally came clean and told us he had actually been working under cover for that period. He got a nice promotion out of it and went back to normal life, if you can call a cop's life normal. I know nothing about what he actually did during that period, and that's the way it should be.

Honestly stunningly gorgeous. You have full lips which is a total blessing, a symmetrical face and what looks like thick healthy shiny hair - does it grow well?

If you're looking for criticism, firstly I'll say I'm in no position and any advice is totally subjective and you should look however you damn well wanna look. But if I was looking to make myself look more conventionally pretty and appealing, I guess I'd grow out that hair a bit and get some colour in it, as you've got quite a plain style at the moment. Your cut can be super stylish, so can the glasses, but personally I don't think they work together, I feel they kinda hide the niceness of your face. Maybe some some highlights, maybe a dark vixen reddish-brown, I can see a jewelly teal colour suiting you massively. A tiny bit of blush/contouring works WONDERS, for any girl anywhere, I do it every day just to lift my face. Loads of YT tutorials if you're interested and you've got good cheeks for it.

I don't think there's anything wrong with your figure. My only other suggestion would be making your eyebrows more arched - get some eyebrow gel involved and shape those badboys. Improves faces to no end. Man, I hope this has been okay and I don't sound patronizing or anything, I so rarely comment on these things, just wanted you to know you have no place in r/amiugly.

Jourdin,Dogtraining,1388792821.0,"I don't know how to word this without sounding super blunt, but I highly doubt she is a Tibetan Mastiff mix. Tibetan Mastiffs, as far as I know, are very rare outside of China/Tibet, and purebred ones can sell for millions of dollars (at most; many cost a lot less than that, but still cost a *lot*).

Please don't judge this dog by what they say her breed is. It's never truly possible to tell exactly what a breed a mixed dog is unless you've seen its parents, and a lot of the times shelters aren't very good at guessing breeds. If she is super sweet and calm, judge her by that, not what they claim her breed is. Take training one step at a time and don't jump to conclusions; if she doesn't have any problems, then don't act like she does because you're afraid she's *going* to. If you act tense when you're socializing her with other people and dogs, she will pick up on that, and that will cause more of a problem than if you're relaxed around her.

As far as her being the dog for you, you're the best judge of that. Ultimately, if you've fallen in love with her, go for it! Throw your preconceptions out the window.

Edit: Also, if you post a picture, some other folks may be able to guess what breed she may be. Also, I bet she's super beautiful, so I'd like to see her :P"

I hope you will find something that will help you. I had 1 on 1 counseling and that really sucked. Some 22 year old girl with NO life experience  saying that she knows how that must feel. SO annoying!!! Then after a break-up I was in a really bad place and they said they had a spot for me in a girl group, I was really hesitant since I don't like groups and girls can be mean/ backstabbing. But it was such a relief. Hearing other stories and seeing that you are not alone in this. I had 3 times a week therapy with different subjects, some cognitive, crafting (really weird), planning your days and make a plan for the week that kind of stuff, some more but hard to explain. But it was really nice not being alone in the shit situation. The only think that sucked was I was single at that time and when I was done with therapy I was feeling great! after a few months I met the guy I am dating now for 6 years but then shit happened again. I had never practiced to be in a relation ship again, with the fears, jealousy anxiety of being dumped/ replaced so it felt like I had to start all over again. I wanted in therapy again but my old counselor said I had to dump him since I was in a bad place but what the hell I wanted to learn to handle this situation.... So anyway, just look for what you want, talk to your doctor or counselor, there are SO many options, look for something that will help you change your fears and the way you cope with situations. GOOD LUCK! and if you want to talk, just pm me :)"

Checking other people's performance in your weight/age/gear class is a good idea, but just because you're not lifting as much doesn't mean you shouldn't sign up!  It's still good experience, and you're better off learning some things sooner rather than later when you feel like you should really be competitive but end up screwing up something stupid.  (Don't fast before a meet if you can help it; don't jump the commands on bench press; choose somewhat conservative openers; don't explode up onto your toes at the end of your squat.)

* The grey line approaches the Mun in pro-grade orbit.

* The red line approaches the Mun in retro-grade orbit, as it would be moving opposite the primary (the Mun).  (This line should look more like one-half of a figure eight, though.)

With this in mind, most people think to land retro-grade because that is how it was done with Apollo, but it had nothing to do with fuel usage.  You actually save a little fuel on pro-grade landings because you are moving slower with reference to the rotation of the body; retro-grade moves you against the rotation, so the reference surface speed is higher, which requires more fuel to slow for a landing.

Apollo mission approached the Moon in retro-grade because of safety: if there was a problem with the spacecraft and a landing could not be done all they had to do was use a free-return trajectory around the moon with a small course change to get them back to Earth.  If they had approached pro-grade, they would need a large course change to re-insert themselves to a free-return trajectory.

For this game, either approach is fine, unless you are going for realism where all Kerbals are valuable.  If that is the case, go retro-grade (red line.)

Every house i've rented over the past 10 years, the landlord or appointed representative comes to inspect the property once every 3-6 months (depending on how paranoid they were and how bad it had been previously, so normally only once every 6 months for me). I get a letter stating their intention to arrive, and when they intend to come. This gives me 2 weeks notice to get the place cleaned up (if necessary), and covers them legally as I have been informed of their expected visiting date, and that if I am not home they will let themselves in with their set of keys. If this is not acceptable it is up to me to arrange a date which is with them.

Once they have inspected the property I am given an inspection sheet detailing any issues. I then have 2 weeks to a month to fix said issues, after which they will visit once more. If I have still not fixed the issues I am in breach of contract and can be evicted at very little notice. Failure to leave voluntarily will result in the police getting called.

I thought this was just something every landlord out there did. Certainly it's standard for letting agencies, and most private landlords will do the same albeit probably less frequently. Otherwise you could end up with this sort of situation..."

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388793553.0,"&gt;If people are going to fail at representing the perspective of the marginalized, I wouldn't go so far as to call them stupid, but it's hard to say that's what you meant because I don't know what part of you restating me is supposed to be accurate and which part isn't.

It seems like you're saying that if someone doesn't agree with feminists, then they have proven that they don't understand women's (supposed) marginalized perspective, and thus their disagreement with the claim that women are marginalized is invalid.

I guess the part I don't understand is how this argument isn't just setting a giant trap that amounts to ""If you disagree with me that proves I'm right.""  Which is an interesting argument, by which I mean it's a load of self-serving crap.

&gt;Xmas is an abbreviation.

That offends some Christians.  You obviously see this as irrelevant, and I'm curious how come you don't seem to see any hypocrisy in that.

&gt;Could you restate all of that to be a little clearer about what you think my position is?

Your position seems to be that because I look at the evidence feminists present for their case that women are oppressed and marginalized and find it farcical and embarrassing to its proponents and ultimately bad for women going forward, then I must either misunderstand what feminism is, misunderstand what victimization is, or be incorrectly perceiving the world.

So basically, it seems your position is I'm either wrong because of A, B or C, and there are no other possibility.  But I reject your reality and substitute my own, and I choose a third option.  Or forth.  Whatever.  And that option is to say ""D) Or maybe your wrong.""

I suspect that your wrong because it appears -- if I'm understanding your argument at all, which is actually fairly unlikely -- that you've created an elaborate unfalsifiable claim that amounts to little more than a very sophisticated Understand Agree fallacy.

I can't really say that you are wrong, but I can't really say what you're arguing."

For graduate students your school work is your job, so you can and should think about it that way. If you worked for a company in a downtown area where parking was $200 a month you could (and should) write that off.

They blew air on the tooth to verify and I... convulsed.  No motor control whatsoever.  Had my bladder been full, I'm sure I would have pissed all over myself.  

Then they gave me an absurd amount of Novocaine and put little triangular blocks in my mouth so I couldn't close it... I thought that was just so my jaw wouldn't get tired.  Then they actually touched the nerve.  Holy shitballs, I'd have bit their fingers off if it weren't for those things.

teuast,AdviceAnimals,1388793913.0,"Most of my dreams have sexual content, but until recently I never actually was able to get any. Then I had a short, intense fling in a far-off city with a particularly intense girl, and suddenly my dreams got far more hardcore. I'll spare you the details, but damn.

So my theory is that your dream engine's art assets, texture files, vocal generation algorithms, and animation keys are all analogous to a DAW's sample libraries—indeed, the dream engine makes use of audio stored in your brain to generate in-dream audio in a very similar way. Just like how I couldn't put a cello section in a recent song I made until I downloaded a cello sample pack, so I couldn't render proper sexual experiences in my dream until I had some IRL.

So the way to upgrade your dream engine? Go out and have experiences, you boring fuck."

**Fun fact for my delivery driver brothers and sisters**: If someone invites you on to their property and you become injured, they are held responsible. We had several drivers who were bit by dogs or slipped on an un-shoveled drive way (I had this happen) and would sue the owners and win. In fact, I don't know of a single time the delivery driver did *not* win.

Dantilli,introvert,1388794137.0,"Well just implement the timetable with his input. Don't dictate, negotiate. Write down everything that needs to be done regularly and ask him which he would prefer to do and you do the rest, it can't be much different to what's happening already. Once you've got the timetable set you can see his reaction to it. But he can't really argue if you work it out together, just don't lean on him to take more work, let him choose what he thinks is fair.

As for an excuse... well I'm sure you have forgotten to do some things in the past, we all do sometimes. You're just wanting to make sure everything gets done and that there is a list to be checked off so you don't forget. A logical extension of that being that your brother should tick off the things he normally does, as he does them. Hence you can get into a discussion as to what he wants to do. You strike me as a fairly organised person so this would probably make sense for you and not seem too suspicious. Again just make sure you timetable your own things too, which is a benefit for yourself and will motivate him, especially if you put both lists next to each other. You might even be able to make some kind of competition out of it with a bit of imagination."

frsp,DebateReligion,1388794148.0,"If a defining characteristic of a human person is the use of free will and intellect, and we are still human persons after death, then we still have free will in heaven.

One could theoretically exercise that free will to rebel against God in the afterlife but there is absolutely no reason to, nobody would want to if they are in Heaven.

As this applies to souls in Hell as well, I retain hope that all may be saved and that there will be a universal restoration of all things to God at the end of time. God wills that all be saved.

However, the souls in Hell do not desire God and while they are in God's presence they choose to reject God, and just as a saint in the immediate presence of God would have no reason to reject God, a soul  who hates God would not have any desire to accept God, barring a post-mortem metanoia.

I would consider my position a kind of subjective universalism; all are saved but not all love God, therefore some souls are in Hell because they do not love God, even though they have the same objective experience of God, they subjectively hate it."

Nausved,changemyview,1388794171.0,"The grower should know who produced their seed. They *bought* the seed! They should have invoices saved up anyway for tax purposes, so the contact details of the producer is right there in writing. 

If they contact the seed producer, the seed producer should be able to provide all kinds of information about the seed produced—such as the germination rate, the expiration date, and the variety—if, for some reason, the grower forgot to write it down or save the labeling.

A company that purchases from a grower should know which grower they purchased from; they should have invoices, too. Plus, occasionally there is an E Coli breakout or something, and officials need to be able to trace it to its source. So this information should be on hand anyway.

With some organization, a company that buys produce should be able to find out what varieties they've bought and which seed producers developed them. I work with a seed production company, and we certainly keep tabs on the consumer products that are ultimately produced with our varieties, and that's a *much* more complicated task.

That being said, I don't think we should label products by whether they are GMOs or not; there are good GMOs and bad GMOs, and I'd like to support the good ones without paying for the bad ones. Instead, I would love to see a list of crop varieties that have gone into the production of a given product."

Grilst,scuba,1388794227.0,"Copied from another post I replied to then added some more specific information to your question :-)

It's kind of expensive to fly from the UK, I did it about a year and a half ago now and I had to go through JFK and Miami international airport and then onto mainland Honduras and then from there either bus/ferry or fly to the island (your choice). It took me forever and it was kind of expensive but it is definitely worth it!

The diving is amazing, I did my PADI instructor there and even if you go to the same dive site more than once you will still find some sweet stuff! Loads of cool wildlife and nice coral reefs around the south of the island there are also some wrecks around the south. There are some absolutely awesome walls around to the North! My favourite dive was a 30m around the North of the island on a wall that dropped to 80m, I could see all the way to the bottom, incredible. Also if you're a Divemaster or equivalent it is legal to go lionfish hunting with a pole spear around the island, they're an invasive species so if you're into that get someone at the diveshop to show you how and then make some lunch afterwards with your catch! 

You can't dive with them but Whaleshark season is around September (I think there is another, smaller season in the area during April as well), if you dedicate your time to looking for them then you will find them, particularly when the water is super calm.

If you're staying for 3+ weeks it's worth checking out as many dive  shops as possible and seeing what they'll do for you specifically because the competition is fierce. They are all good quality. I am bias because I did my instructor course with Coral View but other good shops include Alton's, Parrots, UDC (Utila Dive Centre), Bay Islands College of Diving, Underwater Vision and Deep Blue Divers. There are many many more and they're all along the main stretch of road.

I stayed at a place called Rubi's inn. If you're staying for a long time I would recommend here and ask for a room without air con. It is cost me about GBP60 (can't remember the price in lemps) for the month but I shared the cost with another girl. We had hot water, a double bed each and didn't have to pay extra for bills. I know that places such as Underwater Vision, Deep Blue, Bay Islands College and Alton's all have accommodation on site and it's much easier to meet people this way. Ask around for the best deal, all of the dive shops are on the one long stretch of road.

If you're on a budget, eat as many baleadas as possible, they are so cheap, filling and really tasty. ""Cinema"" is a great place for smoothies and they do amazing Spanish omelette. Also finally, every Sunday R.J.s is open and they do the best BBQ fish. Finally, go to Skid Row and complete their challenge... drink some of the disgusting local brew and you get a free vest (which seems to be the uniform for the island).

There are 3 lies on Utila; 1. I love you 2. I'm not drinking tonight 3. I'm leaving tomorrow
Drinking is super cheap, try the rumonades (rum and lemonade) and definitely go to tequila Tuesdays (20p tequila shots!). If you're into it, weed is really cheap as well but be careful because the local police are corrupt and I've heard some horror stories about run-ins with them when it comes to drugs. 

It is SO much fun there, you will meet loads of really chilled people and have a fab time!

In your situations, since I'm assuming you never ask for (and likely refuse) help, your boyfriends well feel like you don't like them. So it's true that asking for a favor, however minor or intangible, makes people feel needed, important.

I personally think a problem with the prison/criminal justice system is just that, that it seems to effectively harm people's chances of leading a normal, crime-free life, given that it can be considerably harder to find a job and so on with a criminal record. And then maybe people who did time on drug charges might end up reliant on welfare, bringing a greater burden to society than they did before they got caught. I don't really see the benefit of pressing criminal charges for drug possession in the first place, though, if the perps aren't doing anything violent. I don't know where the State derives the authority to stop people from using consciousness-altering substances.

LawBobLoblaw,gifs,1388794463.0,"I'm gonna reply to you because there's no visibility on the guy who said Tyson would get smoked.

And to be honest I'm not sure why he's getting down-voted: the only ""field-specialist"" [using their field and still doing extremely well in the UFC is Ronda Rousey](http://artofgrappling.com/2013/12/29/ufc-168-rousey-tate-judo-throw-highlights-gifs/). Otherwise, unless you're a well-rounded fighter with the ability to enforce your gameplan, you're simply not going to do well, no matter how excellent you are in one field of fighting. 

Chuck Liddell was KNOWN for his brawling (sprawl-n-brawl), and helped make UFC what it is today. However, the punching era is over, and even if you had a powerful puncher like Tyson in his prime, there are so many more tools an mixed martial artist has that even movement, speed, and power can't make up for.

I wouldn't say Tyson would get ""smoked,"" because he does EASILY have that punchers chance, and [there are guys in there who are powerful in the weight division Tyson would fight at, and they get knocked out.](http://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/silva-knocking-out-overeem-at-UFC-156.gif). The problem for Mike is that any good MMA fighter can take away his tools. 

All Tyson has is his boxing. One method. [There are black belts in martial arts with their own academies who sometimes can't even use their method in the cage, because the opponent mixes it up so often.](http://cdn2.cagepotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/GSP_MattSerra_superman_punch.gif)

[Benson Henderson kicked Nate Diaz (a known boxer) in the thigh so many times that it took away Nate's punching power](http://www.mma-core.com/gifs/10002523/awesome_Benson_Henderson_Low_Kicks_Nate_Diaz_UFC_on_Fox_5.gif). [GSP used wrestling and ground-n-pound and BJJ to keep BJ Penn (another fighter known for his good boxing) on the ground, wearing out BJ's shoulders](http://sportsnickel.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/gsp-ground-and-pound.jpg), thus taking away HIS ability to punch effectively even when the fight WAS stood up. And [Mitrione chopped away at Kimbo Slice (yes, THE street brawler, Kimbo) legs until Kimbo was useless.](http://urdirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Kimbo-Mitrione-UFC-113-feature.gif) Punching power comes from your base! Punching is so much more than just snapping at the elbow: the shoulder thrusts forward, the trunk rotates, and the legs generate power --all of which transfer that kinetic energy from your foot into your fist. A fighter looking to take away a punchers advantage will either wear down their shoulders/arms, get close enough to where punching in ineffective, or remove their base. [Here's a pic of what unchecked kicks look like.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/17r6nn/a_reminder_of_unchecked_aldo_leg_kicks/) 

[And then there's Randy Couture fighting boxing professional --albiet retired-- James Toney. Couture just took Toney down to the ground and it was over.](http://www.boobootv.com/2010/08/30/randy-couture-vs-james-toney-full-fight/)


Like I said above, Tyson would fight in the UFC's heavweight division. Tyson weight around 213-220lb's, and anything between 205-265 qualifies for heavyweight. That being said, here's a great analysis on what current UFC heavweight champ did to win against [the divisions most notorious striker](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AgqvngxOo3A/Tr8zrPxfQcI/AAAAAAAAGK4/QuS1nugvF4g/s1600/1.gif):

&gt; against good boxers it is downright stupid not to try and destroy their mobility and their base

&gt; **It doesn't matter how big a puncher someone is - if both of their feet are level or one is off the ground they have nothing to drive off of or onto**

&gt; Expending energy trying to run the pipe and keep Junior down might be a waste of time for Cain, Dos Santos is incredible at getting back to his feet, but Cain Velasquez has shown himself adept at striking in these sorts of in between positions along the fence

[Here's the rest of the article that shows strategy used against a heavy puncher.](http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/12/31/3817174/ufc-155-how-cain-killed-the-king)

TL;DR: The man with one tool will do worse than the man with many. Prime Tyson would destroy any MMA'er in the ring, but an MMA pro would most-likely beat Tyson in the Octagon."

* OS says "".. yeah. ok. just put the letter K at this point on the screen..""
* Graphics card says ""AS YOU WISH, MASTER. PLEASE, JUST A MOMENT.""
* Graphics card then calculates whereabouts the point on the screen that the K should be. It then tells the monitor to light up (or turn off) a series of pixels. As there are no black pixels, it has to to turn off pixels in the shape of a ""K"".

The way I see it though is that morals are opinions. You can agree or disagree with them but this is no overall right or wrong on a universal scale.

We seem to agree on the popularity of drugs being annoying so I'm going to focus on the language and sex thing. I think we should be more open about sex and sexuality and I also feel that there is no such thing as 'bad' language. You seem to support more of a classic nuclear family morality (I'm sorry that I'm generalizing here feel free to correct me) where you feel like bad language and sex, at least in culture and media, are both negatives. When it comes to whether or not one of us has the 'right' morality there is no correct answer since it's just our opinion. 

Also, I am not sure when you were a kid but I can be pretty sure there were songs out there with bad language. It may not have been on the radio but it did have an audience. And even the stuff on the radio had references to sex and drugs.

And to be honest the language thing is something I never got. To me, out of all the things you can do or be exposed to, swear words are the most innocent since they are just words. They don't do anything. They are basically adjectives."

http://www.muscleandstrength.com/articles/truth-rep-ranges-muscle-growth

&gt; Moderate Reps

&gt;This rep range is typically defined as the 6-12 rep range. Moderate rep ranges have consistently been proven in study after study to lead to the greatest amount of growth. The reason that this rep range is so effective for building muscle is because it does a little bit a everything.

&gt;This means that it provides many of the benefits of low rep training combined with the benefits high rep training by allowing for relatively heavy loads to be used while increasing time under tension. The heavy loads allow for myofibrillar protein synthesis to take place which, as discussed, will increase the size of the contractile proteins. The increased time under tension will stimulate sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.

&gt;Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is an increase of the sarcoplasm and other non-contractile proteins within muscle cells and is primarily induced by lifting light loads for higher reps. This type of growth, although not typically accompanied by any strength gains, is the primary reason why bodybuilders tend to be more muscular than strength and power athletes.

&gt;Moderate rep training also induces an excellent muscle pump. While the pump is often thought of as a short-term training effect, it may possibly result in greater growth. Studies show that cellular swelling causes both an increase in protein synthesis and a decrease in protein breakdown (Grant et al., 2000; Stoll et al., 1992; Millar et al., 1997).

&gt;So while low reps with heavy weight is best at stimulating myofibrillar hypertrophy, and high reps with light weight is best at stimulating sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, moderate reps seem to strike a balance between inducing significant amounts of both myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. The proven track record of the moderate rep range makes it so that it cannot be ignored in your training routine."

jolene_jolene_jolene,bipolar,1388794720.0,"I was so reticent to answer this because I'm not anti-medication, however, I do not medicate in the traditional sense under the care of a psychologist. I do take vitamins and stick to a strict diet and I have 'emergency' pills just in case I feel like I need to go back on them but I've been stable for almost two years and, like I said, under the very watchful eye of a really good psychologist.

Since in many people bipolar gets worse with time, I know there is a 90% chance I will  gradually have to add in medication. However, we are trying to use my other techniques first and seeing how that goes! It's been a year without incident, two years without significant incident!"

turtlehana,bigdickproblems,1388794724.0,"The clit is outside the vagina and the g-spot is 1-2 inches inside the vagina. Therefore I think as long as a man knows what he is doing his size will not matter unless he has a micro-penis or is so massive that he simply bottoms out. 

According to our Penis page in askwomen and what I have read elsewhere penis size only matters if he is not thick enough because then she may not even feel it. (Of course there are some women that think otherwise, I don't want to generalize).

Additionally we cannot feel our depth, we feel full but that can be accomplished by a smaller dick. Unless of course she likes her cervix hit (which I do not). We mostly feel the base, rhythm, and pressure not to mention pleasure. (Though I'm just talking about my experience, there could be women out there that are different for example for some women sex is painful). 

Lastly I would say a deeper woman can handle more varying sizes of penis however a more shallow women cannot which may cause her to not want a man with a large penis. The average penis being less than 6"", meaning a majority of men are average, she may not come across a BD for comparison. "

Mais bon, il y en a pour qui ça tient à coeur et c'est bien correct pour eux. Si j'ai absolument à me prononcer, j'y irais avec la séparation. Nécessairement, les gens font références à ta culture lorsqu'ils te parlent et si j'avais à m'identifier à une culture plus qu'à une autre, ça serait la culture québécoise. Je trouve la culture Canadienne plutôt drôle (""sorry"", Tim Hortons, fierté), alors que la culture québécoise a quelque chose de plus... charmant (français, arts distincts, mode de vie plus relax, moins coincé). Je sais que la culture québécoise n'égale pas nécessairement l'ensemble des QuébécoisEs (on est quand même l'une des sociétés les plus mullticulturelles au monde), ce qui envoie un peu l'argument de la culture à l'arrière plan lorsqu'il est question de souveraineté, reste qu'il y a un certain impact ici, j'imagine.

Sinon, euh... économiquement... Disons que Canada, USA, Québec, c'est pas mal la même affaire au niveau économique. Stephen Harper investit dans des saucisses sans éclaboussures, mais ce n'est pas parce que c'est un Canadien, c'est juste parce que c'est un politicien. Anyway, l'économie locale, en 2014? Baaah...

Let's take the one of the leafy trees for example. It's got an impressionist thing going for it, great. But you essentially used the paintbrush as a stamp giving the blotches no variety in shape making it very lifeless and flat. Also contributing to this is a lack of use of color to create depth. Warm comes forward, cool goes back. If you mixed in some pthalo blue with the things in the background it would make your focal point on the front tree pop.

rising_son,Guitar,1388795050.0,"It would be a good idea to get a tuner, [this](http://www.amazon.com/Boss-TU-80C-Chromatic-Tuner-Metronome/dp/B0002D00BE/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388794735&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=boss+tuner) one doubles as a metronome and would be a great buy. A spare set of strings and a string winder would be a good idea also. Other items you may want to think about are a case/gigbag for transporting or storing your guitar safely. Also a tuition book of some sort, if you don't already have one. I learned from [Total Guitar](http://www.amazon.com/Total-Guitar-Complete-Recording-Performing/dp/1402709803/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388794920&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=total+guitar+tutor) by Terry Burrows.

-AllonsyAlonso,AskReddit,1388795454.0,"I think the more important thing in a relationship is to have a proper division labor. If only one partner is working and bringing in the money then the other should be responsible for doing the house-work. If both of them work then they need to divide up the tasks somehow fairly. That's what I believe will lead to a happy/happier relationship. So in the society we live in where more and more woman are also entering the work-force, this is probably the ideal way to go about things.    

  Having said they both might come from a more ""traditional"" family in which case they were just raised knowing that ""this is how it's going to be"" with the wife cooking and cleaning etc. Is it wrong? I don't think so, as long as both partners are happy with it. Some people love and are comfortable with doing it traditional way. "

1) Big Sexy Hair Volumizing Mousse - I normally don't like to spend $20 on a can of mousse, but this stuff is worth it. Spray it directly onto your roots and shafts in the top few layers of your hair before blow-drying.

2) Redken Wax Blast 10 - Again, a little pricey, but I swear by it. I spray this on my roots (very sparingly) and on the shafts after styling to give my hair a little more texture. I tend to run my hands through my hair a lot (bad, I know), and instead of it getting oily and flat, the texture from the wax allows the motion to kind of refresh the volume!

I'm wondering, not so much in the form of a response but in a general kind of way, how do you feel about the possibility of not growing anymore? And if those feelings are negative, do you have any plans on how you may deal with those feelings?

The reason I pose those questions is that although I had amazing friends at that age, I was unprepared for what I would be confronted with outside the confines of my social circle. That, coupled with the hold out of growing more (stories about my grandfather), as well as being immature and self centered turned out to be a recipe for me making some very poor decisions in life.

Ambulance services are already stretched and the caseload shifting towards being a mobile GP clinic without actively encouraging the community that they may as well call the ambulance for free instead of paying for the pleasure of waiting in a GP clinic. So that's shit. People will fill Emergency Departments both by taking themselves there, or because they're think they're being sneaky and will be seen quicker if they call an ambulance (they aren't, and they won't).
  
But what's going to happen is that ambulances will respond to more and more sub-acute problems, but with no reduction in emergency cases. Response times will blow-out and it'll become impossible to ignore, and it will force more paramedics to be hired. Which is great, but would be better if it occurred at the current case-load, not as a result of a further increase. Of course the money to pay those paramedics (and inevitably nursing staff at the Emergency Departments) has to come from somewhere...

Well, no, because we're not talking about a fitness contest or a tryout to be my personal trainer.  We're talking about the job of fighting wars and killing people.  The ""standard"" by which every military person is judged is their ability to kill the enemy, at the end of the day.

I am currently unemployed due to a reduction in force after 11 years of service. My previous employer graciously provided me with 2 personalized letters of reference from division heads, highlighting exemplary service and accomplishments. Yet, I am finding the process maddening, as many others have indicated. Given the length of time that I have been out of work (approaching 7 months), I am increasingly concerned about the gap in my resume. I feel that I can't take any old job that is offered as it will destroy my earning history and career standing. On the other hand, the longer I look for appropriate level work, the greater my service gap. For now, I'm in a financial position to deal with this but I am increasingly worried that the service gap is working against me. In the mean time, I am learning open-source systems, pondering ITIL certification and pursuing a PMP. But will any of that even help if I have a several month service gap?

evilbrent,careerguidance,1388795921.0,"Well perhaps soul crushing is a strong term. But I remember listening to my friend bang on about what a hard job being a teacher is, when in reality yes they work long hours but they get ten weeks paid leave in Australia and in reality they spend a lot of the day sitting around basically just chatting. You want to see what hard work is like? Go check out the dudes working rotating twelve hour shifts at the steel mill.

Anyway, point is that every job is less easy than you want it to be. Yes, there are levels of soul crush, and you do have to be doing something that you can cope with, but my point is just too be aware that yours isn't the only one that's a hard job. My friend would go on and on about the long hours she worked, particularly as a starting-out teacher, and I'd be sitting there thinking ""man, you worked the same hours that I did this week as an engineer, but you get two and a half times more holidays than I do"". Her husband worked in IT for a bank in the city, left for work an hour before she did, got home an hour after her, and I never once heard him complain about his job.

On the other hand I have a friend whose first engineering job was working for a major second tier automotive supplier, and he got treated like absolute crap while their. Things like: the unionised workers refused to go up on the tarred roof to find out where the sunlights that had been tarred over were, so they sent the graduate; the workers refused to clean the grease pits out after a breakdown so they sent the graduate; they would need to have a thousand cars in the yard counted and tagged over the weekend, so they'd send the graduate to come in on the weekend without pay in the blistering sub to do it.

He left them by quitting on the spot at one point and I don't blame him. You shouldn't have to put up with that shit just to pay your rent.

----

You won't be doing THIS for another forty years. What you're doing now is grunt engineering, because as a graduate you know basically nothing. One day you'll look back on these grunt years and you'll realise how far you've come. Trust me, when you have five and then ten years of experience, and can operate entirely on your own judgement, then it's a cool profession. When they start letting you break things and build things and invent things, it's pretty cool. Sure it's a drag a lot of the time, I mean it's just a job, but it beats working for a living."

A quick google search shows various sources. Most say that the unaroused vagina is 3-4inches and doubles in size when aroused. I don't know that there is statistics. I never felt the desire to look for any. 

If you listen to your partner, make sure she is aroused, use lube, and maybe even get a penis ring that'll take an inch off (not necessary unless bottom out or you just want one) you should be fine. Know how to use your hands and your tongue (nobody knows what they are doing the first time, just listen to her). Most women do not orgasm the first time and some women cannot orgasm with a partner even with clitoral stimulation and can only orgasm on their own. For some women that have difficulty orgasming during piv they prefer to orgasm prior with fingering or oral. Just listen to your partner and know that no orgasm doesn't mean she didn't enjoy it.

akatokuro,AskMen,1388796004.0,"Ironically, in my group we *insult* each other by grossly overestimating the size of each other's junk. Why? I have absolutely no idea.

Rationalized conjecture would suggest it has to do with superiority complexes that have been driven into society. The 'small penis' is said to not be able to pleasure women, so the inverse is often applied: meaning, the bigger one is, the more pleasure it provides. This can be paralleled in traditional body-building, bigger muscles being better/more able. This is perpetuated by the porn industry, where the male actors average much larger than the world average, while female actors seem in blissful pleasure. So when the regular guy isn't able to get his girl to scream like that, he seems 'inadequate.'

So the insult is less about actual penis size, but ability to pleasure a woman. Very rarely are comments even legitimized (most guys won't know the other's size). It could just as easily be turned around on guys with overly large penises which limits the sex you do get --society hasn't quite reached that tipping point yet though."

To me it's about I can be a stay at home mom if I want or I can be a career women and never get married or to the extreme I can polyamourous or whatever!  Why do you need women to need you to be manly? Create your own role, define manliness however you want and roll with it.  I was taught to be intimidating and aggressive and I have chosen that is not a role I want so I have decided to be something different.  Another way to put it, I don't need a man to feel feminine.

Interestingly, our society has been slightly altered due to the sexual revolution. While women have had the upper-hand in relationships through teenage years and early to mid-twenties, the tables then shift to men having the upper-hand in relationships.

Don't be like the plethora of women in the United States who didn't care about their future in their prime and cast-off a relationship with a good man in favor of the ""bad boy"". You'll only end up sad, bitter and alone writing on an Internet forum how all men are pigs."

This is clearly group (arguably religious) banter that is held with no scientific understand of the topic.

thingsliveundermybed,relationships,1388796079.0,"I think it's vital you speak directly to university authorities about this, and if you can the police about the punch. She has launched a bullying and harassment campaign that has led to you being assaulted. You don't sound bigoted: you sound like someone who has figured out the boundaries of his sexuality and that is fine! 

I'm not trans, but to the best of my knowledge keeping your status secret for that long in a relationship (sexual or not) is generally unacceptable. There are plenty of valid reasons not to blurt it out on the first date or two, but waiting five months?! If I'm wrong, any trans folks are free to correct me. 

Take some evidence, go to your student welfare office, and seek disciplinary action against these bullies. Make a fuss. If it doesn't stop you could look at transferring, but let's make it a very last resort if your grades start to suffer and there's no end in sight. You should also sever all contact with her, her family, etc: don't give her any more words to twist. Her abuse of the liberal, open minded approach at your college is shameful. Talk to your remaining friends and seek counselling through your uni if you feel very isolated. An accusation of bigotry is a big deal, and quite frankly it's gone too far for you to handle it alone. Good luck.

I am very traditional so I'll probably be a worst case scenario for you. Disclaimer, I'm not a parent but if I were in your fathers shoes this is what I would do:

Firstly I would self reflect and wonder where I went wrong in raising you. It is his duty to raise you properly and to honor God and he failed. 

Now I would discuss this with your mother but ultimately the course of action would be my decision. As he gets all the blame for your raising he gets to call the shots.

I would tell you that you would be dishonoring God and cannot move in with a man you are not married to. Until you are married a girl is bound to her fathers decisions traditionally.

But you have an out, obviously whatever your country is in does not use the Bible as it's legal standard. You are an adult and can do whatever you please. If you were to move in with this guy you would be failing to obey your role in the family so I would no longer be obligated to fulfill my role as a father to you. I would cut you off financially and emotionally. 

If you were curious in if I think either you or your boyfriend are bad people I do not. I am not better a person than you in the eyes of God. We are all filth that need redemption. I fault your father for this situation, he should have raised you better."

&gt; Can an alert not give a reward if it expires with you still doing it?

This is a slippery issue which could be dealt with one of two ways, depending on how DE has decided to deal with this:

1. They have done nothing about ""reserve slotting"" and thus enable players to get the Alert items after the Alert has disappeared, so long as they enter the Alert mission before the timer runs out.

2. They have done something about ""reserve slotting"" and thus has disabled the ability to gain the reward once the timer runs out.

3. Some other variable or result that I have no knowledge of.

- ME2: Favorite is probably Horizon. For some reason this was probably my most difficult mission on the insanity setting which made it a lot of fun. Plus the reaction I got from my former romantic interest at the end honestly took me by surprise the first time I played; I thought it was a great second-act plot wrinkle that paved the way for the third game nicely. Favorite loyalty mission is a toss-up between Garrus and Tali - both had fun, quick combat sections followed by the chance to make a decision that could have a major impact on your squadmate. Least favorite mission might be Thane's loyalty mission (""Sins of the Father""), it felt like kind of a half-assed attempt at a full-on stealth mission. That's really being kind of nitpicky though, there honestly aren't really any missions that I thoroughly dislike. 

- ME3: Favorite is definitely Tuchanka. Just a beautifully constructed level with a big emotional payoff (if Wrex is your homeboy, that is). Least favorite - do I even have to say? Hint:  *the fucking Starchild* "

The armour was mostly correct to the period - the men had short, stabbing swords, bronze helmets, and chain mail with reinforced shoulders. However...the one thing that DID irritate me was the shields. They got the shields all wrong - mostly because all they did was rip the designs straight off of the Praetorians on Trajan's Column. Needless to say, that's absolutely wrong. The design on the shields of the Spanish legions was a bull (*Legio V-X*), and *Legio XIII Gemina's* emblem was a lion. Shields in Caesar's time were also rounded off, rather than absolutely square- but to be fair, they did a superb job other than the shields."

Party starts, and it turns out Slash has magic powers, enabling him to become invisible at will and to teleport. He also had wings. So we teleported to another room, and just hung out and chatted for a bit. We heard other people coming, so I went to hide under the bed (I know, worst party host ever), and Slash said ""no, it's ok, just use your wings."" So I thought about having wings and grew some and turned invisible too.

My older sister has always been ""bigger"" (not fat, just like five pounds over weight; still healthy, but noticeably bigger) than me. My parents spent our entire childhood coddling her, buying her clothes that would make her feel good. They often said things like ""don't call her fat,"" or ""don't make fun of her for how much she eats."" (As if I was some horrible person who would sit around taking digs at my sister just for giggles. She never had a problem with her weight, still doesn't. I never knew why they made such a big deal about it.) But there I was, *only having recently breached the 100 pound threshold*, being told I need to eat more, that I was too skinny and that I looked sick. Even now, at 5'1 and 109ish, they still tell me I'm really skinny and could stand to put on weight. As if that doesn't hurt my feelings, to be told that I'm too skinny; that I have an eating disorder. I've been battling body-images issues since I was a little girl. I know I'm fine the way I am, but I always  push myself to eat, eat, eat, even though at times *I. just. can't.*"

I don't care that china has aggressive animal rights activists that are slowing down the shark fin industry. As long as there is one restaurant with shark fin on the menu... thats the story I want to hear. Thats what people should know about. Because thats bad and its negatively impacting me and the rest of the world. 

Renewable energy... again, don't care. Its very nice, but I'm more interested in the shadowy fog that plagues a country than their new solar panels.
