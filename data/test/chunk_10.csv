I don't care if people carry openly or not but who the hell needs an AR-15 for defense? I mean objectively the only reason anyone carries a gun on them is for defense, other wise they're just carrying it around like an accessory. 

If you find yourself in a situation that a gun is needed to defend yourself a handgun will suffice. There is really no situation in which you need an AR-15 to defend yourself unless you're on the border and are at odds with the local cartel. And if that is the case you've already made a few wrong turns.

Here I am thinking this guy is my age or so (thought he was 16/17 area). Nope, guy must have been 25/26 at least. Peer pressure, fear, and the fact that I was sexually abused as a kid made me shut down and NOT GTFO like I should have. So we did the deed, he goes away. 

Fast forward to a little while later, he starts bothering me again. He must have picked up on some of the signals that I was abused and if he said the right things I went completely complacent and did anything (hello diss associative disorder!). So he did the same thing but instead of my house it was his place this time. (Yup it happened twice!)

It's really difficult to answer most of your questions without knowing more about your product. Also your observation of where you need help may or may not align with where others believe you need help. (Is marketing the issue or is your product not meeting market needs? - There's a reason it's called product/market fit)

At your stage you want to see a team of 2-3. Do you have any advisors? Seems to me you should be shooting for a startup accelerator, not an incubator (but we can get into semantics of who calls what what). Every incubator and accelerator is different as far as the structure of their program, what they offer, etc. They also often filter for specific markets, stages, scale of ideas, etc. So you may be a good fit for one and not another (and sometimes they share their parameters on their sites - so you have an idea if you're a fit or not).

The Seahawks have the flamboyant, controversial, and world famous secondary known as the Legion of Boom. In my utterly biased opinion, the LOB is the best secondary in the game today, leading the NFL in interceptions and allowing the fewest passing yards. 

Cornerback Richard Sherman is one of the biggest personalities in the game today; he is an avid trash talker and instigator and backs up his talk with superb play on the field. Strong safety Kam Chancellor speaks softly and carries a big stick- he's known league wide for his violent, bone crunching hits. He is the Boom in LOB. Free safety Earl Thomas is a thrill to watch; he is in on every play, covering great distances to cover passes or coming up to make plays in the run game. The remaining corners Byron Maxwell, Jeremy Lane, and Walter Thurmond are all fantastic players themselves and have filled in nicely for CB Brandon Browner who was suspended recently. "

Brightt,DebateAChristian,1388914134.0,"&gt; I understand your argument, but you are ignoring God. God is an infinite being, and is the victim of all sin. 

Even if I agree to god being an infinite being, that still doesn't mean that my temporal sin will inflict infinite suffering onto him.

Let's say me and my SO get in an argument, and I say something hurtful. She'll be hurt, and thus suffering, by it for a while, but she won't feel hurt about every little thing I accidentally hurt her with until she dies.

Suggesting that a being that is supposedly infinitely more wise than me or my SO does suffer for eternity from every little thing someone does wrong, is quite strange, because that would imply that being doesn't understand the temporal nature of human behavior.

Not to mention, that argument would also nullify any concept of remorse or forgiveness of sin, since according to you, he'll suffer for eternity anyway.

And as a bonus, it's quite odd that he suffers from the sin he bestowed us with to begin with.

&gt; Furthermore, all human victims of sin also exist immortally, and will be affected by sin for eternity. 

Human nature is temporal by default. My analogy above deals with this similarly. You'll never (or rarely) suffer from something someone did to you forever, hence I don't really think this argument holds up either."

For example, I know a couple of ENTPs, and they are clearly using their functions differently than me. They are a lot quicker wits and.. well they have a different ""energy"", probably stemming from the fact that they use their third and fourth functions differently as well.

Run in wait for mobs to get close and hit challenge. Or manually trigger a block response with ignore the pain or traited warriors fortitude then hit litany and shield taunt. 

Challenge does not build agro on its own. just forces things to attack you. Hopefully youll get a block response and can then hit litany/ shield taunt.

If a tank has heals on him at the start of a fight and he has no agro other than initial agro... The mobs will run at the healers.

To combat this.. Make the mobs run by you with your positioning or just stand by the healer.

Saffs15,NFL_Draft,1388914417.0,"No way. 10 yards is good, but a punter or kicker aren't going to make plays very often, simply because they aren't going to be on the field very often. While occasionally you'll hear that a punter has put his team in a really good position, you'll never hear him winning it. 

But in the first round, you still have a lot of starting talent on the board 90% of the time. Guys who can sometimes take over the game, and prevent the punter from getting an opportunity, which is good. Or make the other teams punter make a kick. Take that guy, and get some yards with him.

The highest I would pick him up? Likely the 4th or 5th. Rarely will a punter go before then, so I'd feel I have a chance at him then. And if I don't, I get a player who should get me some good production vs 10 yards in situations I want to prevent happening as often as possible.

Besides, alteration is so much easier to level up in comparison to security.

I don't know, I've been playing the game for years and I've found a blend that I like, and it just so happens to be one that works in the game.

Jeffreyrock,philosophy,1388914804.0,"&gt; Why must he so assume? It seems unrelated.

""I must assume...the existence of a conscious intelligent mind.""  I have thought about this a lot and I think what he is essentially saying is that on some level, deep down, there needs to be a unity behind nature's diversity-- a singular thread that ties it all together, that makes all the forces and particles of the universe follow essentially one set of laws.  A similar insight might eventually be had by someone sitting repeatedly before movies in a theatre before suspecting that the manifold displays seen on the screen are all distilled from one singular beam of light.

&gt;I don't know that the point you mention is strictly supported by the given Heisenberg quote

Perhaps it is, perhaps it isn't-- in any case it's certainly at least related and grounds for an interesting discussion.  I for one find it rather enlightening that, as one endeavours to pin down the most basic constituents of the material universe, they are forced down pathways often spanning multiple dimensions and comprised of objects that can, at heart, only really be described as objects of pure thought.  On top of this every thing we can and will ever understand about these matters must by necessity be done through the medium of consciousness.  Is it even possible for us to cognize something independently of it?

&gt;The point you make following the quote is not a reiteration of the quote but your own elaboration, so ""in other words"" was inaccurate. 

""In other words"" was a poor choice of words I agree.  I do hold, though, that what I said was a logical extension of what Heisenberg said.  Or, at least that I'm willing to argue that case.

&gt;The fact that we only understand mathematics through thought is a condition of being thinking things

Could it not also be due the fact that the objects of mathematics are themselves ultimately forms that can only be percieved through the protracted abstractions of a conscious mind?

&gt;but this does not go so far as to say that those things of which we think depend on our thought.

I never limited anything to ""our"" thought.

Thank-you for your thoughtful reply."

As for your ex, this really is the time to heal. As strange as it sounds, consider yourself lucky that she blocked you.  I do understand it's a great idea that you two would have some presence in each other's lives, forever - but for now, having no contact will help your heart heal faster, quicker.  It's a much slower and more painful process if you're in each other's lives every day, as you keep on feeling what you're missing out on, start seeing her date other people, memories are brought back of good times long gone, so on and so forth.  So, for now, you  can focus on you, and eventually when she's healed as well, she may open the door and you can pick up where you left off.

I'm perfectly fine with you saying you want guns banned, but the problem is that when you say that, you advertise the pro-gun law side, thus adding more people to ""your"" side of things, which the anti-gun law side doesn't want, so we debate anyone we see advertising gun laws, I'll admit, most attempted ""debates"" end up as a giant pissing contests filled with ad hominem fallacies, but regardless, it still ends up helping both sides in some way, shape, or form.

I recommend learning some statistics from wikipedia and formulating a defense of your argument before you state it, it helps a lot, seeing as most people are scared away by an actually coherent retort.
Oh and also I suggest taking a gun safety class, just so you can learn how strict most ranges actually are, and how *most* gun owning people are taught how to handle a gun.

kicker7955,changemyview,1388916658.0,"Part one: Why?

&gt;I think everything we do in life is pointless. I believe our whole existence is pointless. ....  So what's the point of it all? I mean tons of creatures on the planet have died off and it's just insane. What has become of them. Nothing if you ask me. 

Why do you care?

reality check, I assume you're a atheist cause nihilism and theism are really a tragical combo for the psyche. So speaking as atheist to atheist, meaning, purpose, logic, causality, opportunity, self realisation, identity...are all human abstracts they are just words without meaning to anything not related to human agency and cognition. As the universe isn't sentient all your complaints are as crazy as complaining that your car doesn't ask for coffee or that break calipers live a futile life.

&gt;The fact we die, or any creature dies. It doesn't feel like we are contributing to anything.

Again, the universe isn't sentient it can't demand, it can't complain it doesn't feel used or feel gratitude. You exist in it, its like a apartment, only you need to vacate at the end of your life.

&gt;Or what about still born babies or things killed of that don't get to experience life, be it good or bad? 

Shit happens, literally, I repeat the no sentience part about the universe and add, there is no judgement, some get lucky and others don't, no hard feelings because you don't really have anyone to complain to.

&gt;Humans (hell the whole ecosystem of EARTH) are always competing, competing to be better, to be stronger, smarter you name it. We compete all the time for our own selfish gain. It's so bizarre.

No, we compete because we are cared little children than feel vulnerable and worthless, only some learned that achievement helps with that. A happy rational human being doesn't work 50 hours a week, settles down with a partner and buries his dreams, sits around the table with friends and family members he's got nothing in common with, they are just coping mechanism with futility, and these behaviors over time became the socially acceptable norm.

Part 2: Because;

Think of it life like a sandbox game, great graphics, everything has (aggravating) tutorials, there are no game saves or cheats or main mission, but there are a shitton of side quests.

We want, feel, love, dream, hope, fight. We experience joy, happiness fulfilment, excitement, anticipation, lust, fear, pity, respect and desire. All of these are achievements, the girl, the job, the beer, the car ride...are all plot device to get those achievements.

Every NPC is ridiculously complex and some change your entire gaming experience, there are similarities but everyone is unique, some are part of tragic storylines, some make bad decisions, others have the ability to help/solve your quest and you don't even have to ask.

Some will nag you  and expect something from/of you, but you don't have to listen to them, the only problem is that decisions are irreversible, and these NPC's have spectacular memories so choose your actions wisely.

So what do you  do with an overly complex game? you enjoy it, you find minigames and play hours, you listen/help/fall in love with  the characters. You improve your skills to get ridiculous rewards, that mean nothing objectively but make the progress much more enjoyable, you search for that one special achievement nobody managed to get, and you get your name on the high-score panel to life long after your character dies.

TL;DR
 we don't experience life, we live to experience(how can i trademark this?)

So? It fits with the theme of the song, those women chose to do it, and those women *do not* feature in the music industry. They are *models.*

&gt;Thicke's justification for the song was 'what a pleasure it is to degrade a woman'.

Full quote follows:

**GQ: Some animals also made it into the video…**

Robin Thicke: We tried to do everything that was taboo. Bestiality, drug injections, and everything that is completely derogatory towards women. **Because all three of us are happily married with children, we were like, “We’re the perfect guys to make fun of this.”** People say, “Hey, do you think this is degrading to women?” I’m like, “Of course it is. What a pleasure it is to degrade a woman. I’ve never gotten to do that before. I’ve always respected women.” So we just wanted to turn it over on its head and make people go, “Women and their bodies are beautiful. Men are always gonna want to follow them around.” After the video got banned on YouTube, my wife tweeted, “Violence is ugly. Nudity is beautiful. And the ‘Blurred Lines’ video makes me wanna…” You know. And that’s the truth. Right now, with terrorism and poverty and Wall Street and Social Security having problems, nudity should not be the issue.

Sometimes an item gets sold out on the sales floor before getting replenished from the backstock. Usually promting the customer to request an associate retrieve the item from the back stock.

There's a difference between ""that *is* being"" and ""that is *a* being"".  

&gt;but you are, in the face of scientific fact.  

Not at all.  

&gt;We're you actually unclear about what we were talking about?  

No.  Because life is a process, the idea of beginning isn't particularly useful.  

&gt;A process is a discrete set of events.  

No.  It's just convenient for us to describe it that way.  Perhaps a better word for what I mean is 'continuum'.  Life is not a discrete set of events.  Many of the divisions are arbitrary - based only on the things we give particular value to.  

&gt;there is a qualitative difference between the components prior to fertilization, and what they become after  

Yes.  That's what makes it noteworthy.  

&gt;This is a scientific reality; it's indisputable.  

I really wish you'd stop asserting the indisputability of things I'm not disputing.  

&gt; It has an eye color, hair color, sex, etc.  

That is to say, those things have been determined even though they don't exist yet.  

&gt;It's exactly a human in the same way. One isn't more human than the other. Fetus, infant, adult; they're all 100% human.  

You keep making this mistake.  A foetus is human.  A foetus is not *a* human.  I'm getting sick of repeating it.  

&gt;It's exactly a human in the same way.  

No, it's not.  A foetus is significantly less devloped than an infant.  There are reasons why we call them different things.  


&gt;You seem to have decided that weak humans aren't worth protecting.  

This is something you have read into what I'm saying and not something I've actually said.  I cautioned you about this earlier.  Please stop it.

calexanderj,AskMen,1388917637.0,"I don't entirely agree with the premise of your question. Let me try and clarify a few things. Obviously these are all generalities and there are exceptions, etc., etc. 

When men fap, there's usually but not always a mental component that accompanies the ""fapping"", it's easier to stay aroused when thinking about something arousing.

Porn, for the most part, replaces the need to imagine.  So if a guy has the access to porn and privacy, and can get on his laptop whenever if feels the urge, he's less likely to have fapped to every attractive female he knows. If you are not okay with your man watching porn, it would probably be helpful to supply him with some fapping aids, pictures, videos, etc.  However, the thing about the male brain is that it responds to variety. Which is why if your man watches porn, he almost certainly doesn't watch just one video over and over again. 

If he doesn't have access to porn, he needs to use his imagination, and so he'll think of all sorts of things to get aroused (again, variety).  He will think of his SO and re-live  particularly hot sexual encounters or encounters he'd like to have,  he'll think about past sexual encounters (ex-girlfriends), or he may think about banging Debra in accounting.  He's probably not running through *every* attractive female he knows, but you're better off not knowing who's on that list. These thoughts are all just a means to an end. And that's why it's ""crazy"" to be asked to only think of your significant other.  Because depending on the circumstance, thinking about your SO can make the *end* more difficult to achieve. You can't tell someone to be more sexually aroused by you than the 22 year old in the sports bra that was on the elliptical in front of them at the gym. Hopefully he is in a general sense, but in that moment when he's alone and wanting to fap, it's hard to dictate what will get it done the best. And the goal is to have the fap be as satisfying as possible.

Depending on your man's libido, and how frequently you have sex, and how frequently he faps, it may not be a big deal to for him to limit his fantasizing to you. But if he travels alot, or you're in a long distance relationship, or if he wants it every night and you want it once a month, you are pretty much asking for the impossible if you never want him thinking about anybody else.

Hemtroll,spaceengineers,1388918380.0,"Everyone has their own building process and their own ship style so it's hard to give concrete tips on how to make good looking ships but I'll try to explain how I work when I build. All of the following applies only to large ships because that is 95% of my builds. For reference, [here](http://imgur.com/a/sLWid) and [here](http://imgur.com/a/MnWlm) are some of the ships I've built in the past. How you start off depends on if you want to plan out your entire build in advance or just wing it until you're happy. Personally, I always improvise as I go along but before I even start I ask myself a couple of questions.

1. What is the purpose of this ship? If it's going to be a carrier, I'll need a very different design and different features than if it's going to be an unarmed transport ship.

2. Is it going to be part of a series of ships? In my first link, every ship was built separately but as you can see they all share some characteristics like the color scheme, the ramming wedge up front, the blast shields on the sides, the almost square hull and the little ditch running down the middle on the bottom and the top of the ship (painted white). These are all fairly insignificant details but when you look at the bigger picture it's not hard to imagine that they were built by the same company for some larger organization. If you're building a ship that is part of a larger series you've got some of the work cut out for you before you even start since you have certain details and features to fall back on.

3. Is this ship inspired by something? Inspirations can be anything from a sci-fi movie to something you dreamt  to a weird shape you saw at work. One ship I'm working on now was inspired by a shoe horn I saw at my friend's house. The Millenium Falcon, arguably one of the most iconic space ships in sci-fi, was inspired by a hamburger. If you see something and think ""that could be a neat space ship"", try it!

Assuming that the ship I'm building isn't inspired by anything and isn't part of a series, the first thing I will do is map out the approximate size of the hull. For smaller ships I simply place a box with the general (inside) dimensions I want and if it's a bigger multi-level ship I will place several boxes with different functions. The important thing here is to build it as big as you want the inside to be. You can easily add additional layers to the outside to make a thicker hull but if you finish the ship and notice that the inside is too small you're shit out of luck. Maybe there's a hangar bay, two generator rooms, the command bridge (assuming internal bridge), a crew compartment, engineering, a med bay and so on. It will likely change multiple times during the build but the point is to get a general idea of how big the hull will be so your outside details end up the correct size.

After that I like to map out the silhouette I want the ship to have. In my second example I wanted to make a straight ship with a long, tapered front and a thicker back end to house all my forward thrust. After placing all my compartments I mapped out the silhouette as seen from the top, then I worked on making similar tapered points for all the different levels. I always kept the general theme in mind but I hadn't picked a color scheme or any other details ahead of time. It's important to mirror the sides (assuming you're making a symmetrical ship) so that you can easily change your mind without adding a ton of extra work to undo.

The layers on top of the tapered points came to me as I looked at it from the side and thought to myself that it needed to look thicker. Often, adding extra details on the outside of your ship makes it look more complex but the key is to stay consistent and to make it look deliberate. See this recent post by [tsoccer93](http://www.reddit.com/r/spaceengineers/comments/1ucyc0/add_some_spice_to_your_ships_with_greebles/) or [the relevant Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeble) The one rule I follow for all my ships is that I want them to look designed. I want to look at any one detail on my ship and think that I placed it there on purpose and not because I forgot to account for thrusters and threw them in wherever I had room for them.

The different parts of the ship are as follows:


* Top
* Bottom
* Side
* Front
* Back

I usually work on these separately, a little bit at a time, in whatever order I feel like at the time. I'll come up with some small detail that I think looks neat and then I will use that detail across the entire ship to give it a more consistent appearance. I try to mix it up and use a couple of different themes like tiered armor, blast shields, pointy ends, covered thrusters or whatever it may be. The important part is that the back end looks similar to the front end which looks similar to the side etc. etc. Building a good looking asymmetrical ship is (IMO) much harder than building a symmetrical ship so I would stick to mirrored ships to begin with.

Got much longer than I was planning on but I'm pretty sleepy so that's my excuse. I hope some of it makes sense!"

What's more, the Soviets pretty much dismantled Latvian Air Forces (literally).
So to say that Britain owes the planes to Latvia is, well, ridiculous. Any contract would have been voided by the events that happened.

Modern relationships seem frivolous because people are frivolous, and without the social pressure or cultural programing people won't stay in relationships where they are unhappy for extensive periods of time.

From my experience women that don't have a male role model(not negesarally divorced or with dead beat dads*) tend to be either in need of an external source of esteem, or have an overcompensating ego, but both are capable of long term relationships if their partner understands their psychological needs and decides that satisfying those needs is a small cost compared to the potential benefits.

4. You'd have to hold it at an extreme angle for stuff to fall through that hole.

5. Tiny items *like* earrings. Not all things are magnetic. Your solution may work better in some cases but that doesn't mean this isn't a decent solution. 

6. This is a stupid lifehack to begin with, but your reply is more stupid.

7. Someone may to wish avoid the look of bottles. This is an idea for presentation.

8. You missed the point on this one by trying to be funny. Either continue being ""brilliant"" or just shut up already. When you poke fun at decent ones you lose credibility on the ones you may have been serious about.

9. Yeah, I wouldn't carry that around either.

10. The coaster trick isn't guaranteed to solve all problems. Only some. It also won't prevent your drink from being spilled in the case of a mortar attack. Why didn't you point that out?

11. Buy a screwdriver isn't a life hack. But you're onto something with the butter knife. I don't see electric prongs as a good solution.

12. You're being dumb again.

13. Buying a stud finder to find a stud is the opposite of a life hack. You're missing the point again.

14. You're being dumb again. This is an idea to help with an issue. Not an attempt to erase the issue by getting rid of relationships over your Gilmore Girls box set.

15. Illegal* not illigal. Also, do you only own two shoes? I don't like the hack because a shoe sitting in a car isn't very stable, but it is better than nothing.

16. You don't know how you'd get toast out of the toaster if two pieces were put in there? Earlier you said ""Do you even lift?"" I think you can figure this out.

17. You just wanted to say ""batch file"". A solution to a problem isn't ""Hey, avoid that problem."" Shutting down a computer by accident may seem like a dumb problem to have but at least someone has a solution.

18. You're just being snarky and missing the point again.

Incidentally, if God's omnipotence cannot violate the laws of logic, then the Trinity is fucked. It relies on God being able to circumvent the laws of logic. As is the claim that Jesus is both fully human and fully divine.

This stuff has been weighing on me for months, since I had a purging spree a few months back but I already don't have a lot of stuff at my apartment. Here I had so many clothes I don't need, trash and paper and useless things. Shitty shoes I never wear.

It's so refreshing to have all this stuff out of my room. I still have some work to do (I passed out from jet lag at like 7pm) but knowing that all my drawers and shelves are mostly empty is such a weight off my shoulders.

&gt;You approach this argument like everything is trivial and you wrap parenthood in to that category. Parenthood is a life changing event no matter how it happens.

So you should bloody well give men the same choices that women get about it.

&gt;We are not just talking about a man here, we are talking about the life of a child as well.

So you think abortion is murder?

&gt;No matter how the child was brought in to the world, the man has a responsibility to the child no matter what.

That's what we're questioning. Why shouldn't the man get a chance to opt out if the woman gets one too?

I have been smoking weed for about 3 years now (almost always daily, although small amounts and only at night). I thought it would help me relax, which it did, aside from the weird paranoid moments. It took me a long time to realise that weed is actually the cause of my worsened anxiety. Although I don't stress out about the usual things, I stress out about other things. I have a lot of new triggers when I am stoned which make my mind and body race. I've been thinking about quiting for a long time now but I couldn't do it. So while it is possible to quit weed, it is definitely not innocent and you can actually get kind of addicted. After tonight (and sooo many other nights), where I spend almost the entire time being stoned with a racing heart, I have made up my mind.. NEVER AGAIN.

ScipiiRye,CanadaPolitics,1388920001.0,"I have a very serious issue with people crying ""sexism"" and ""misogyny."" Firstly because today it is done at the drop of a hat, and secondly because there is rarely an effort to substantiate those claims.

&gt; Men become fathers when women become mothers.

Irrelevant. Men don't give birth. Who stays home to care for the child in its early years is not your decision to make, it is the parents'. Why is the mother staying home ""sexist"" while the man staying home ""the right thing to do""? Shouldn't the decision be based on who has the greater income? Expecting people to do things purely to be in line with your own personal ideology is unreasonable. You can't just unilaterally declare all traditional gender roles as ""sexist"" and declare all people who voluntarily choose to follow them ""misogynists"". You're making assumptions about the motivations of others.

&gt; It's a societal ailment that justifies men being absent from their children's lives.

*That* is blatant sexism. I want the irony of you crying ""sexism"" while espousing sexist views yourself to sink in for a moment. Sexism != prejudice against women. That you think maternity leave is an excuse for fathers to ""be absent from their children's lives"" is appalling and extremely belittling to the decisions of a couple.

&gt; Bigotry.

Unsubstantiated claim and also irrelevant. Your desire for equal representation will never be factor when a board of directors chooses a CEO. Nor should it be, it is their decision to make, not yours.

&gt; Societal ailment resulting from how we groom men and women to act and behave.

Oh, please. For the most part men get along better with men, the reverse is true with women. Crying ""sexist social engineering"" brushes with radical feminist theories on ""patriarchy"" and denying gender dysphoria.

&gt; tend to be rated as more trustworthy by both women and men

&gt; Misogyny. 

Misogyny is hatred of women. You're implying that the men and women polled wherever these sources are misogynists? That they hand-picked self-hating women to validate these claims? Don't be ridiculous. You have no data to prove that these answers were motivated by the hatred of women.

&gt; do not need to spend vitally important energy and time dealing with people who are unhappy about their gender

&gt; Misogyny

That's true, whether you like it or not. Men simply don't have that problem. I would agree that that is a truly sexist issue, but misogyny it is not. I question whether or not you understand the implications of that word, since you're eager to misuse it and can provide no evidence to justify its use.

&gt; Societal ailment that pressures men into consuming their adults lives in dedication to labour, rather than enjoying a fair balance of life between work, family, and self.

That is a stretch, one made purely in the name of confirmation bias. You're not in a position to dictate the reasons why the trends are the way they are.

&gt; A meta-issue resulting from gender inaccessibility of sports.

What? Women play hockey anfd football. There are women's leagues. You can't argue that sports are inacessible to women, that's ridiculous. You're reaching so hard it's shocking.

&gt; Sexism/Misogyny/Bigotry, depending on how the reporting is spun.

Valid complaint, but how callously you seem to be able to write off whatever you don't like as ""sexism/misogyny/bigotry"" really only serves to solidify the idea that you're using these words solely to discredit things you don't like or agree with.

&gt; Sexism; see also: Thatcher.

Women are not ambassadors of their gender. Thatcher is a person and a prime minister who happens to be a woman, not a woman who happens to be a prime minister. Thatcher could do what she did because she was Thatcher, not because it's an ability intrinsic to all women.

&gt; Sexism; even if there is such a basis of truth to this, it would result from how our culture grooms women to behave and grooms others to behave towards women.

This is genuinely sexist, but an argument can be made that women are more prone to insubordination towards male superiors due to being encouraged to ""fight patriarchal values"" or whatever, so don't take your theory as gospel.

Points I have not addressed I agree are sexist, but really, pointing to notions and then simply stating ""sexism/misogyny"" by using pseudo-scientific gender theory in some cases or providing no substantiation whatsoever in others is *not an argument*. Your post is of very low quality, I am sorry to say. You cannot simply debate by stating ""sexism"" in and of itself. That would be like my quoting each of your points and then just tacking on one-word responses like ""stupid"" or ""wrong."""

silverionmox,PoliticalDiscussion,1388920009.0,"&gt; If making a choice about an abortion was the same about making a choice about paying for your child, you would be right, but it's not.

You reduce it to paying or not paying, but that would be the same as saying ""woman choose to abort because they don't want to pay for a child"". Why is the choice of a man to decline parenthood less important than the choice of a woman to decline it?

&gt;That's not ""fairness"" in the sense of both genders getting an equal choice- which is what the opt-out crowd seems to be advocating. It's fairness in the sense that it acknowledges female's unique role in childbearing and assigns to them additional agency, given that reality.

And they should get that agency as far as it extends to their own bodies, but it does NOT extend to other people.

&gt;This is true so long as you completely ignore the welfare of children

There are no children yet. If that argument is valid, then abortion is murder, quod non."

&gt; There she is sarcastic about the phenomenon is that Sweden Democrats in particular, but anti-immigrant , xenophobic and racists in general long argued that one should throw out people who commit violent crimes and were born outside Sweden . The point will be to extend the argument to include men . It's the same argument. Score Magda then makes is that there is an inconsistency in reasoning . It does not appear that there are crimes in themselves that make it worthy of immigrant criminals to be thrown out of Sweden .  

&gt; She ironically also the fact that by far the most debated issue in Sweden ""can not be discussed ."" Many argue that no one is talking about immigration , even though it is constantly on the agenda.  

&gt; Therefore , she has a point in that ironic . There is a discourse that is built on many contradictions. To be ironic about ""immigrants"" or ""Christian"" is a completely different thing than to be ironic about the inconsistent discussion looks.

If you have guy friends that are single, there's a good chance you have guy friends that are interested in being your friend with benefits.  

Invite a guy friend over to your place to watch tv, a movie or just hang out.  Just the two of you.  If he accepts there's a good chance that the thought of making out with you has entered his mind. Not that he's expecting it, but it's crossed his mind at least once.  If he's not interested at all, he'll probably turn down the chance to go to your place and not do much.  

If he comes over, you can either bring the conversation around to sex, mention you've never had it, and depending on his responses, you should have an idea about whether or not to ask him to be your fwb.  Or if you're sitting next to him on the couch you can put your hand on his hand or his back and see how he responds.  Keep escalating slowly until he moves away, or gets up to ""get something"" and sits down a little further away.

The key to being FWB is discretion,  he may not want everybody else in your circle of friends knowing what's going on. And making sure you stay on the same page.  If you're signing up for FWB, you don't want to fall for the guy and make it awkward if he's not interested in more."

The rest of what you've said is just apologism that seeks to assign noble motives to people that you did not know and cannot speak for. Simply because you *think* that the founders of Israel did not have transfer in mind, does not make it so. [Their own written records provide extensive evidence that they most certainly did plan for it](http://www.palestineremembered.com/download/Palestinian-Transfer-Chaim-Simons.pdf).  At this point though, this is the third time I've explained and cited to you how the Zionists who founded Israel HAD TO seriously consider and plan for an ethnic cleansing.  
  
The same goes for your absolutely ludicrous claim that Palestinian citizens of Israel are entitled to or given equal rights or protections under Israeli law. There exists a mind-boggling amount of evidence to the contrary, and to save myself time, I'll just copy an older post:

* [are intentionally excluded from the domestic political process and have never once been part of a coalition government]  (http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/01/30/why-arab-parties-are-excluded-from-israeli-coalitions.html)  
* [have been the stated target of ""loyalty"" campaigns that seek to imprison and deport those who don't swear fealty to a Jewish state](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/10/israel-jewish-oath-new-citizens)  
* [are targeted by much of the right wing as a fifth column that should be ethnically cleansed from Israel and ""transferred"" to Jordan](http://samsonblinded.org/israel_palestine/4transfer_israeli_arabs.htm)  
* [aren't allowed to rent apartments owned by Jewish landlords](http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/dozens-of-top-israeli-rabbis-sign-ruling-to-forbid-rental-of-homes-to-arabs-1.329312)  
* [face institutionalized discrimination in employment and hiring](http://electronicintifada.net/content/rampant-employment-discrimination-against-palestinian-workers-israel/8837)  
* encounter racial discrimination and abuse at the thousands of security checkpoints located all throughout the country, as you might be able to verify by watching the news for five minutes or speaking to any Palestinian ever."

lydocia,AskReddit,1388920955.0,"&gt;A name day is a tradition in many countries in Europe and Latin America that consists of celebrating the day of the year associated with one's given name.

&gt;The custom originated with the Christian calendar of saints: believers named after a saint would celebrate that saint's feast day. In many countries, however, there is no longer any explicit connection to Christianity.[1][2] It remains more popular in the Catholic and Orthodox parts of Europe, as Protestant churches generally do not venerate saints.

&gt; The concept of name days is similar to the more common birthday, except that the association of a name to a day is entirely arbitrary. In the Eastern Orthodox Tradition, the name day corresponds to the day on which a saint ""fell asleep"" or died.

I had this same thought as I was reading it. I remember getting to the end and my reaction was basically ""...that's it?"" It was addressed in class but the very feminist professor simply glossed over it in order to resume the discussion on how great feminism was. Her lectures were pretty much exactly what you described your class discussions as.

The class we studied the novel in was a critical theory class, so I wrote my essay on comparing the interpretations of three different authors of essays packaged with the novel and then framing their arguments within the greater feminist lines of thought.

I received a B-, I believe, but I derived no pleasure from writing it and it left a sour taste in my mouth since I had to essentially operate under the assumption that all feminist theories are ""true,"" as you say.

I was born in Nepal and got to visit there again when I was 14.  It is a beautiful country in so many ways, and I would love to go back someday.

To answer your questions briefly, the apostles were Jesus' disciples who established the early church.  Due to their efforts and those of Paul, one of the first missionaries, the church grew from a few people in Jerusalem to all over the Roman Empire and now the world.  The apostles all became church leaders in different areas, and all except John were martyred; he was exiled to an island in the Mediterranean called Patmos, where he experienced the visions in the book of Revelation. 

The Old Testament records the relationship of God with the people of Israel.   It includes books of history, poetry, law, prophecy, and more.  The New Testament starts about 400 years after the end of the Old Testament and records the life and work of Jesus on Earth, the establishment of His church, and letters from early church leaders like Paul and John to various churches and believers.  For instance, the book of Romans is Paul's letter to the church in Rome, and is mostly about God's an of salvation for all people.

Although Jews and Christians both believe in a Messiah, Jews believe He has not come yet, whereas Christians believe that Jesus was the Messiah who came once and will again.  That is probably the central division between the two faiths.

silverionmox,PoliticalDiscussion,1388921528.0,"&gt; So much about your response makes clear your moral view that the welfare of the individual adults is the only thing that matters, and that the welfare of the child matters not at all.

If the welfare of the potential child is what matters, then abortion is murder. It isn't, so it doesn't matter.

&gt;Firstly, you are adamant in your assertion that abortion is just like ""opting out"" of parenting. It's really not

Sorry, but that's just an assertion. I agree that the right to decline parenthood is but a side effect of the right to abort, but it's also implicit. We don't demand the motivation why women want to abort (for good reason, it's their decision, period), but that implies that ""I don't want to be a parent"" is a potential reason for abortion. Even if it is a side effect, we should still strive to give people as much equal rights as possible. We still can't give the man a right to become parent if the woman aborts.

&gt;and the fact that the woman can choose whether or not to abort doesn't make the decision or act any easier. The reality of how abortion plays out is not something you seem to be aware of, but a little more compassion and understanding of that choice should make clear that it is utterly divorced from the emotional ease with which one can just choose to not pay for something. You are ignoring this reality because you want to balance your equation between abortion and financial-opt-outs, and it doesn't wash in reality.

I know that abortion is not fun (and even expensive). That doesn't make it any less of an option. Pregnancy and giving birth is not fun either. I could agree with charging a price, similar to abortion, for men who would opt out (let's share the burden)... but torturing them a bit to represent the discomfort of abortion goes too far.

Secondly, it seems that you only want to see ""he's too greedy to pay"" as a possible motivation to opt out. I think that's pretty sexist. Parenthood is just as important to men as it is to women, and they too have reasons to decline that are as valid as those of women do, if they choose abortion for that reason.

&gt;I mean, what?? You state that you don't want to be the father of a child, and therefore you magically aren't?

We're discussing whether such an option is a good idea.

&gt; You need to balance your equation, so you ignore the different realities of a child being born or aborted. To you, if a man opts out but a woman chooses not to abort, then it's not the man's fault that the child has a tougher life, it's only the woman's.

Yes.

&gt;In other words, an aborted child has the same moral value to you as a born one, once the man opts out.

As far as the man is concerned, yes. At that point the woman still has the last word and decides whether the child is born or not, well knowing it'll only have one parent.

&gt;That is so unfathomably unjust, but you need to ignore the child if the equation is going to balance, so you just cut them out of it.

If the needs of a potential child matter, then abortion is murder. Quod non.

&gt;That makes no difference to the child, if they are born! They are screwed because their dad didn't want them but their mom did

Exactly. The woman chooses to have a child in subpar situations because she absolutely wants to. How is that the man's fault?

&gt;but because the agency of the dad has been judged by you to be more important than the welfare of the child

No, because the agency of the man has been judged just as important as the agency of the woman. It's the woman who judged her desire to have a child as more important than the welfare of the child, if  she chose to give birth in those circumstances.

Abortion does give decision power to the woman, but with power comes responsibility. You just can't demand that everyone involved folds to make the wishes of the woman come true.

&gt;Sex creates babies. The decision to abort or not abort comes after. Having sex is the point of mutual decision between parties in which they have to accept the possible consequences.

That's the line moral conservatives use when they argue against abortion. It's a bullshit argument when they do, it's still a bullshit argument now.

&gt;If there were not a mutual act of sex, then you would be correct in asserting that the man didn't make a choice in the same capacity as the woman, but they did.

If the woman gets a chance to change her mind after the sex, then the man should too.

&gt;No children here! Who cares about the fact that there will be kids born under this opt-out system that go 50% neglected

If the father didn't want them, they would be neglected anyway, whether he paid or not. The damage already has been done. Forcing them into a kind of indentured servitude really doesn't help the child, it only helps to satisfy urges to control and punish people.

&gt;You don't want to talk about the consequences of this idea because you know what they will be and you can't defend that outcome.

Why should I defend the outcome of the choices of the women who choose to raise a child on their own? Plenty of single women use sperm banks to get pregnant, or initiate divorce, or adopt. Should we make this all illegal too then, since it has the same outcome?"

There is only the law of conservation of energy and momentum.  Remember that awesome dude Al?  Man said that E=mc^2 and all that.  Energy is conserved, but you may look at this and see that mass is also conserved.

Do not be fooled!  The true equation is E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 when you have something in motion.  Consider, for example, a photon with energy of 1.022MeV/c^2.  The photon has p^2 c^2 = (1.022MeV)^2 since for a photon m = 0.  Now consider a pair of electrons, each having mass 0.511MeV/c^2.  Suppose you have these electrons stationary, just kind of sitting there like a tiny little boss, they would have p = 0, but m = 1.022MeV/c^2.

Now, given the above, if I had a massless photon (with spin 0) and a pair of stationary electrons (each with spin 1/2, but bound together in a spin 0 configuration), are they not equivalent by the conservation of energy and momentum?  Indeed, they are!

the combat is Skyrim-esque with some flourishes thrown in. But kind of awkwardly. I'm not sure how to describe it. It's basically auto attack where you can hit numbers for special attacks. Like, I chose to use a 2-handed sword and had a lightning ability. so I'd be hitting something and then I could press 1 and I would fire a lightning bolt.

the problem is I wouldn't know exactly when/what I was attacking because things are sort of out of sync. I think it's mostly because of the next thing I'm going to mention: the combat flourishes. mostly weird reaction stuff where you can like dodge a fireball or run out of range of a hit. it doesn't feel fluid at all. and really not satisfying.

My problem is when people look for (unreliable) indicators of that rare woman who is non-hypergamous and hasn't had many sexual partners, then use those indicators to justify settling down with her.  

Instead of ""most women aren't like this, so look for the vanishingly rare ones that are"", it would make more sense and lead to happier relationships to say ""most women aren't like this, so develop a relationship style that works with *how most women actually are*.""

ZeamiEnnosuke,AskReddit,1388922979.0,"I had two times where I was pretty close to death, both of them were suicide attemps.

The first time I was 14 or 15 and depressed. It was my second attempt, to end my life. The first one didn't work out because of people seeing me swimming where swimming isn't allowed. However this time I wanted to take a safer approach and got a shit ton of some kind of medicin (I think it was somekind of sedative but I don't really remember, back then I didn't care) and some booze. One evening when I was alone at home I took like 20 to 30 pills and three glasses of vodka to get it down. I was laying in my bed on side and I felt just sick.   I hoped it would end soon, but with every minute the sickness would become more and more intense and at one point I started to vomit like a fountain. It just sprayed out of me onto myself and my bed. I think I vomited for roughly an hour or so, because in the last few spits there was a bit of blood.
Then I got all downsy and started to sleep just to awake in the middle of the night in my own partly dired vomit and blood. I was angry and sad that it didn't work. Cleaned up the mess and told my mom I had somekind of flu or something. I don't really know how close I was to dying but I think if I hadn't thrown up I wouldn't be here anymore.

The second time I wanted to kill myself by slicing my wrists in a bathtub full of warm water. Again I was alone at home. I prepared everything. I wrote a letter and 'said' my goodbyes. Placed myself in the tub and sliced my wrists open. Shortyl after I put the knife away I hear the front door opening and someone comes home. I start to freak out. I don't want them to find me before I'm dead. So I get out of the water clenching a towel to my wrists. Release the water and start going down stairs to find my sister arriving. She sees my wrists and assumes that I just cut myself on glass or something, so she helps me stopping the bleeding and puts on bandages. I don't know how much blood I lost  but I felt very drownsy the next few days. I just told everybody that I fell into glass and cut myself on that.

These are my two stories, I'm not sure which was closer to death, but after the thing with the knife I never was anywhere near the point where I thought I would die."

Abortion is in no way like the holocaust.  ""Destroyed with prejudice"" does not describe abortion.

Ignorance.  You have made it clear that you think abortion is the same as murder.  It is not.  

&gt;Of all the fucking... seriously? You think I've done that little research on embryology?  

Yes and yes.  You demonstrated as much in your posts.  

Here are some noteworthy excerpts:  

&gt;In biological terms, however, prenatal development is a continuum, with no clear defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus.  

&gt;A fetus is also characterized by the presence of all the major body organs, though they will not yet be fully developed and functional, and may not all be situated in their final anatomical location.  

&gt;The heart, hands, feet, brain and other organs are present, but are only at the beginning of development and have minimal operation.  

&gt;The lower limit of viability is approximately five months gestational age, and usually later.  

&gt;When such premature babies are born, the main causes of perinatal mortality are that the respiratory system and the central nervous system are not completely differentiated.  "

They're good for getting an idea of the person, but you don't know what was running through their minds while they answers or how long ago it was when they answered and if they've changed since them. 

Also I think you're generalizing men, which is fine because you're upset right now, and you have every right to be upset, because as I said before, dating is heartbreaking. But once you calm down a bit, take a deep breath, and write down fine reasons why you're amazing and three  things about yourself that makes you beautiful. Then remember that the internet is full of asshole, limit yourself to checking okcupid no more than once a day (unless you get an alert), and find another source of dating in the local area, such as speeding dating or going to a bar. The best way to find a date is to keep your options open.

&gt;**The government and its security forces, often considered to suffer from rampant corruption,[130] have been responsible for torture, inhumane treatment, and extrajudicial executions. There are arbitrary arrests of citizens, especially in the south, as well as arbitrary searches of homes. Prolonged pretrial detention is a serious problem, and judicial corruption, inefficiency, and executive interference undermine due process. Freedom of speech, the press, and religion are all restricted.[131] Journalists who tend to be critical of the government are often harassed and threatened by the police.[94]**

&gt;The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants reported several violations of refugee and asylum seekers' rights in the organization's 2008 World Refugee Survey. Yemeni authorities reportedly deported numerous foreigners without giving them access to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, despite the UN's repeated requests. **Refugees further reported violence directed against them by Yemeni authorities while living in refugee camps. Yemeni officials reportedly raped and beat camp-based refugees with impunity in 2007.**[133]

&gt;**Yemen is ranked last of 135 countries in the 2012 Global Gender Gap Report.[134] Human Rights Watch reported on discrimination and violence against women as well as on the abolition of the minimum marriage age of fifteen for women. The onset of puberty (interpreted by some to be as low as the age of nine) was set as a requirement for marriage instead.[135]** Publicity about the case of ten-year-old Yemeni divorcee Nujood Ali brought the child marriage issue to the fore not only in Yemen but also worldwide.[136][137][138]

Most teachers have a starting salary from 25-40k depending on where they live. I looked up the principle pay of Carmel Indiana (a wealthy suburb), it's 105k to 130k. Possibly overpaid, but principle is a pretty tough and stressful job, so I don't think that's necessarily overpaying."

In recent years Heaton had some roads that flooded. Try to be wary if you live anywhere near these and if it's prone to doing it again. Or make sure you have relevant insurance.

almightybob1,AskReddit,1388923858.0,"If God is subject to the rules of logic then that screws over other claims about God such as the [Trinity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity) claim. According to the claim and the helpful diagram, God is both one, and three distinct parts. But a fundamental rule of logic is that if A = B and B = C then A = C. So the Trinity claim that Father = God and Son = God and Holy Spirit = God but Father =/= Son =/= Holy Spirit is a logical impossibility.

Similarly if God is subject to the rules of logic, then Jesus cannot be both fully human and fully divine. By the rules of logic, if B =/= C and A = B then A =/= C. Since human =/= divine then if Jesus is fully human he cannot be divine, and if he is fully divine he cannot be human.

Christians should think very carefully before claiming that God is subject to the rules of logic, since several of their core tenets and beliefs rely on God not being restricted so."

ElDiablo666,Anarchism,1388924271.0,"It's funny, I submitted a similar action plan here a few years ago. I asked why every anarchist outfit needs to be a fucking coffee shop and bookstore; why not an amusement park? That's obviously me having fun but it's true, we absolutely need to do this. I call it parallel institutional building: instead of abandoning people and moving to the middle of nowhere to be part of some farming commune, why not replace all of the local capitalist institutions one by one?

Anyway, a good way to get started from your questions would be to survey the methods people have already employed. Then we can see what works and what doesn't without experimenting too much. Just going to the anarchist bookstores and coffee shops and chatting with them about their collectives should present you with a whole new set of questions and ideas and such.

As far as collective management and prices are concerned, my personal thought is that if there is a need for conventional hierarchy type decision making, it would need to be shared and rotated. Like, electing an emergency captain every quarter or six months or something. Some people are really good under stress and pressure, some not. You have to figure out a rotation schedule that meets everyone's needs.

Next, who cares if decisions are collective and that takes longer? It's more fun and the only way to respect liberty. It's not like Brian is dying while you decide which curtains to put in the rooms. Also, collective decisions lend themselves to unusual outcomes, like everyone decorating their own floor differently and stuff you never would have thought of otherwise! Remember, if singular vision is needed you can always rotate or keep the outfit small.

I haven't officially announced it yet but I'm doing something similar with healthcare: starting a nonprofit anarchist insurance company designed to run like a government plan, since that's who should be the provisioner of that anyway. I'm glad there's someone else out there who thinks we can take over industries other than books and croissants. :)

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, there should be a way to organize as a nonprofit entity with anti-treason/anti-terrorism provisions to keep it anarchist. Then there should be enough of a way to figure out how to make operating profit sustainable without gifts--or maybe you'll want to organize as an entity that can accept gifts, I don't know. Perhaps there would simply be a sliding scale or something or you could try a partial honor system, partial income system, or explicitly mention you're a pay-what-you-can establishment."

Rx16,PoliticalDiscussion,1388924283.0,"If a corporation commands the wealth and resources, it can crowd out any upstart business with relative ease."
MightySasquatch,AdviceAnimals,1388924291.0,"So the technical explanation is that Australia and European countries have what is called a Value Added Tax. This is a tax on businesses for the value that they add onto the product. So if you pay $300 for the raw materials, and turn it into chairs, and sell the chairs for $1500, you pay the VAT on $1200.

Because it's a tax on businesses they have nothing to 'add' to the sales prices, they have already paid the tax. It results in increased prices on goods, but what you see is what you get for taxes.

In the US however it's a sales tax. The consumer is responsible for paying it, and it is occasionally tax deductible (typically people in the US can either exempt their state income taxes or their state property/sales taxes from federal income, but not both). Tax exempt organizations are often freed from paying it, under certain circumstances. Companies can choose to include the sales tax in their price if they want, but they don't have to, and often don't because it makes their products look more expensive. But movie tickets often include the sales tax, as well as some other industries.

Now, your next question might be, 'why don't states require companies to include the sales tax in their advertised price (both inside and outside the store)?'

Well my friend, that's an excellent question! And the answer is a combination of that making way too much sense and the fact that businesses more or less get whatever they want in the US. And businesses don't like having to include the cost of sales tax in their prices, so they don't. Simple as pie."

1. Find a reason to stop.. Good one: It makes you look like you are diseased and no one wants to kiss that.

2. Try to be constantly aware of the fact that you need to stop it. Every moment you catch yourself doing it, stop yourself. I know it is annoying and that sometimes you don't want it to stop! But STOP IT. 

3. Try to realise that it doesn't really make you feel better. I'm refering to the clenching feeling at the moment it hurts.. It's not relaxing, which is probably what you are aiming for. It makes it harder to actually concentrate on the stuff you should be doing. 

4. LICK YOUR LIPS. Lick your lips always. It makes the flakiness go away (not in the long run, just at the moment). Again, it will annoy the shit out of you but do it.

5. Cut of your nails so you can't pick it. This also will be annoying as hell. If you don't follow my other steps you'll probably find yourself still trying to pick at it, but at least you won't succeed.

These are my tactics. As I told you I'm not a succes story, but I'm sure that if I'd stay true to all these steps I'd overcome my 'addiction'. 

Also... If you can, find yourself treatment so you can do something about the underlying issues that make you pick at yourself."

Takuya-san,dwarffortress,1388924618.0,"&gt;source material is freely available on the author's site

The original tutorial he wrote is very out of date and is barely useful to a new player. The book contains a getting started guide plus a ton of other material.

It includes a detailed explanation on all sorts of food production, good explanations on the different types of industry, it includes information on justice, healthcare, babies/death, the military, engineering, and so on.

While all this information is available on the Wiki (with better explanations in many of the cases) the book presents it as a newbie-friendly explanation, with many of the topics including screenshots and other things.

DF wasn't user friendly enough for me to get into since I was too lazy to invest a large amount of time looking into things. The book held my hand and now I love the game.

Also the ebook version is much cheaper with a coupon and comes with free updates. It's not for everyone, and there are lots of free alternatives (e.g. captnduck's excellent video tutorials), but I just thought I'd give my 2 cents on why people would buy this book."

There's hair, facial structure, body type and structure, etc. And then once emotions get involved (and these can toy with how people perspective attraction)  attraction becomes so much more complicated than one or two physical attributes.

Thom0,pics,1388924701.0,"It's not British, its English. Why do American's insist on using the wrong terms?

By the time the famine happened the act of union had been passed and the parliaments unified, it was the UK. The UK as a whole managed the Irish affairs and those managers were the rich elite, the lords and kings. The UK was in a state of chaos, famine, fighting, lots of nasty shit. Food was taken from one hungry mouth and given to the other, the UK didn't have the extra resources nor organization to properly assist Ireland, especially because Ireland was also in a state of chaos and moving any UK assets to Ireland would require further military assistance and it just wasnt worth the effort.

Being of English descent doesn't mean you're English, it just mean someone in your family got on a boat at one point in time. Them being of English descent would have literally zero effect on any social relationship between you and them, its not like they are a separate group or a minority. If you're born in America then you're American, the same logic applies to any country and any person.


I should also add that not all rich English people were cold and heartless individuals, a fair amount advocated for Irish aid and genuinely helped out of there own pocket.

You should keep such a painfully misinformed and misguided input to your self, especially when you have absolutely no deep understanding of such a touchy and complex point in history.

shadow1515,pharmacy,1388924733.0,"&gt; My comments are directed at those undergrads who decide on a whim in their senior year based on what their friends and family tell them about the profession.

This is the important part. Making such a monumental decision, for *any* profession, on a whim is going to end badly more often than not. The key is to make sure that if you invest your time and money in going to graduate school for something, you probably should be at the point where you don't have to ask, ""Is this right for me?"" to an Internet forum before you pull the trigger and start applying. 

I thought I was pre-med in undergrad. Took the MCAT and everything. I did well on it, had killer LORs, and plenty of extracurriculars to the point I'm confident in saying I would have been accepted *somewhere* had I applied. Fortunately I figured out before I dropped $1000+ on applications that it wasn't really what I wanted to do. I just say this because that's a profession that has more prestige and a much more secure financial future than pharmacy, but the same advice about carefully considering your options before committing to something still applies. I might have made a lucrative career as a physician, but if it wasn't what I really wanted to do (it wasn't) then I would have been miserable anyway. The same goes for pharmacy. It's not only about the job outlook, it's about realizing what a lifelong commitment it is to choose a profession that requires so much education to enter."

wordserious,AdviceAnimals,1388924767.0,"As a Brazilian living in the US, I have to say I love this country (or I wouldn't have chosen to live here), but I had to laugh when mu brother, while visiting me, got told in very harsh tones to put out the cigarette he was smoking in a public park. After listening to the barrage of indignation, his reply was ""sorry, I come from a free country...""

EDIT: yes, I know, this is not what makes America free, my freedom ends where your begins, etc. I agree. I understand. I don't smoke either and I don't like others smoking around me or my family. But you need to see this from the point of view of someone who is not familiar with the culture. My brother would never light up in a closed space, but in open space, he failed to see the logic. Also, if he had been asked politely to put it out, he probably would apologize and comply, it was as more the very hostile, curse word-laden way in which he was approached that made him say his wisecrack. In reality, if I had seen him light up I would have asked him to stop myself. I just thought this was funny because I know and understand both cultures."
MightySasquatch,AdviceAnimals,1388924769.0,"Posted above but repeated to help explain:

So the technical explanation is that Australia and European countries have what is called a Value Added Tax. This is a tax on businesses for the value that they add onto the product. So if you pay $300 for the raw materials, and turn it into chairs, and sell the chairs for $1500, you pay the VAT on $1200.

Because it's a tax on businesses they have nothing to 'add' to the sales prices, they have already paid the tax. It results in increased prices on goods, but what you see is what you get for taxes.

In the US however it's a sales tax. The consumer is responsible for paying it, and it is occasionally tax deductible (typically people in the US can either exempt their state income taxes or their state property/sales taxes from federal income, but not both). Tax exempt organizations are often freed from paying it, under certain circumstances. 

Companies can choose to include the sales tax in their price if they want, but they don't have to, and often don't because it makes their products look more expensive. But movie tickets often include the sales tax, as well as some other industries.

Now, your next question might be, 'why don't states require companies to include the sales tax in their advertised price (both inside and outside the store)?'
Well my friend, that's an excellent question! And the answer is a combination of that making way too much sense and the fact that businesses more or less get whatever they want in the US. And businesses don't like having to include the cost of sales tax in their prices, so they don't. Simple as pie."

A great sales tip that can be used on yourself is first, prior to taking the risk remind yourself that you're going have those feelings and that it is normal. It doesn't mean you've taken a bad risk. In some ways this will nip your feeling in the bud prior to them actually surfacing. 

A second tip is to review all the positive reasons why you decided to take that risk.... There was a reason or reasons why you went forward with your decision. What were they? List them. This can be done after you've taken the risk and while you're experiencing that remorse. 

Finally, think in detail about the absolute BEST outcome that could occur by taking the risk.  What kind of success could it bring you? How can it advance your life? Etc.  You can also think about the worst possible outcome of taking the risk. Typically, you'll realize that the potential benefit far outweighs any bad that could come. 

Remember, many times success is just on the other side of fear! Good luck.

Probably sneakily hidden away somewhere in ""settings"" or something like that.

If I fail to read the mandatory safety warnings on a new knife I bought, and then stab myself in the stomach with it, I guess that's the government's fault.

&gt;Instead they will have an institutionalized corporate reality of default internet censorship that they will have to explicitly address with new legislation if they want to do away with it.

You and I have both acknowledged that the filter is in place due to government pressure on the ISPs. No more government pressure = no more filters. The ISPs don't want this; it's not good for business.

&gt;ll your counterarguments amount to ""yes, but it's not that bad.""

This is most likely around week 3 or 4 into training. At that point you are starting to string together things correctly, but still fucking up a lot... 
They are conducting buddy team drills which is one of the basic battle drills we (Soldiers) are taught in Basic training. The one on the left is supposed to be covering and ""directing"" his battle buddy on the right.

The one on the right is saying ""Tell me where to throw my grenade."" Which to my knowledge is incorrect, unless it has been changed in the last few years. He is supposed to be saying ""Cover me while I throw my grenade."" To which his battle buddy is supposed to say ""I have you covered."" He then throws his grenade and both trainees are to take cover on the ground. The one on the right does an alright job, but takes too long to get up. THe one on the left not only has his weapon ejection port facing down into the sand, he realizes he lost his grenade... 

His face is priceless.

All in all this is expected to happen. This is early in the training, they are still getting used to the hectic schedule and lack of sleep. If this were to happen outside of training, I'm sure that soldier would not last long in the military... Then again... "

Ceva ce n-am văzut menţionat e inegalitatea socială. Deşi era comunism, unde se presupune că oamenii erau egali, nu era deloc aşa. Copiii de securşti, ofiţeri, activişti aveau avantaje la şcoală, liceu, intrau la facultate şi nu erau repartizaţi la Cucuieţii din deal, în schimb erau puşi şefi de intreprindere la Bucureşti. 

Also, popi securişti şi spovedanie direct la tovarăşul general de Securitate.

It'd be nice if every youngish players had a probability of being a rising star, so in each career mode you can't just revert to the same players. I think PES does it better at the moment, it seems that each player has the potential to be good/great if they get played constantly and play well."

The thing is, the main mechanisms for the mortgage bubble was a result of free-market innovation. There are a few really big ones, but let's focus on two: securitization, and credit rating agencies.

Securitization basically allowed mortgage companies to pass the entire risk off to hundreds of third parties. I'm sure you've heard the tale by now -- bundles of mortgages are put together, rated as a Grade-A security, and sold to investors. Investors get a slice of the total pool's profits. Theoretically, this is a good model. However, it introduced warped incentives to the mortgagees, who now had incentive to create as many loans as possible, securitize and sell them immediately, and pocket the immediate return without having to worry about later losses. So you get lies about income, people being told to deposit the same money repeatedly to inflate their monthly deposit numbers, or just outright lies about interest rates, payments, borrower's income, etc. The market set up a system that allowed risk to be completely hidden from those taking it on, and paid the people hiding it for doing such a good job. No government involvement was required to make this happen -- if anything, it was actually government involvement that *stopped* it for so long. Yes, the REIT Act allowed for these trusts, but that means that prior law had prevented them from forming. Remove the government interference in the market, and this might've happened in 1950 or 1910 instead.

Of course, without the credit rating agencies, none of this would've happened. The CRAs, incentivized by being paid by the producer of a product rather than its consumers, gave out extraordinarily high ratings to shitty mortgage trust packages, which then failed. Consumers got the short end of the stick, but CRAs hold a de facto oligopoly on the market for creditworthiness information, so what else can they do except keep trusting Moody's bond ratings?

The larger point is that the housing bubble opened my eyes to the reality of market failure, though, and made it impossible to ignore."

http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericgoldman/2012/11/08/another-google-adwords-advertiser-defeats-trademark-infringement-lawsuit/

These are only a few, the article covers many.

&gt;Other examples where the trademark owner surely was wasting its money by suing over competitive keyword ads (previously noted in this post):

* Storus v. Aroa: the defendant advertiser got 1,374 clicks over 11 months.  Based on the low cost of the goods at issue, I estimate each click was worth about $1–making the lawsuit’s value less than $1,400.
* King v. ZymoGenetics: the defendant advertiser got 84 clicks.
* Sellify v. Amazon: the defendant got 1,000 impressions and 61 clicks.
* 800-JR Cigar v. GoTo.com: the search engine defendant generated $345 in revenue (not profit, just revenue) from the litigated terms.
* 1-800 Contacts v. Lens.com: Lens.com made $20 of profit from competitive keyword ads. 1-800 Contacts unsuccessfully tried to hold Lens.com responsible for affiliate ad buys which generated about 1,800 clicks, which under the most favorable computations were worth about $40,000.  1-800 Contacts spent no less than $650k (and was willing to spend $1.1M) on its lawyers in this case.
* InternetShopsInc.com v. Six C, the defendant got 1,319 impressions, 35 clicks and zero sales.

hurston,changemyview,1388927017.0,"I agree with you that instincts are hardwired, and that is where your initial premise is faulty, as you assume all people are the same biologically. Take the desire for sex. People have varying levels of desire for sex, from the sex mad at one extreme to asexual at the other extreme, with all points in between. This is controlled by levels of testosterone and oestrogen in the body.

The nurturing instinct, that rewards you with positive fulfilling feelings for dealing with kids is exactly the same. You can have baby mad at one extreme and people who don't like children at the other, again with all points in between. For people who have a strong nurturing instinct, yes they will find having children the most fulfilling thing they can do, but for people who don't, kids will make them miserable and other life goals are far more important and fulfilling. For them, having kids is not a primary drive. In fact, kids can be unpleasant for them.

In short, everyone is not the same, biologically, as you."

wufoo2,sex,1388927046.0,"It's the subtle touches that work. He has 50 percent more nerve endings than a cut guy (they're in the foreskin) and a glans that gives him a much wider range of sensations.

What this means for you is better ROI: Less labor, more enjoyment.

The foreskin's nerve endings specialize in stretch-and-release, like the nerve endings in your lips. You know how good it feels when your guy just works your lips with his? Same for your lips and tongue on his foreskin.

Rolling the skin stimulates those nerve endings, too, peeling the glans like a banana then rolling it up again. Roll the foreskin closed and slide your tongue inside it, between the foreskin and glans. Swirl. You may have to pause occasionally for him to stop shaking. ;-)

The glans likes gentle, wet friction. (It can be touched dry, but only completely dry. Even a little moisture makes it tacky.)

Also, he'll have a frenulum, whereas most circumcised guys don't. That's the raised, cordlike tissue connecting the underside of his glans to his foreskin. It's very, very sensitive to direct stimulation. (I think it's key to triggering orgasm during sex.) Don't go right to it, though. Save it for the finish.


You didn't ask about hygiene, but I'll address it. Just as you wouldn't want a guy going down on you unless you were fresh, he might be self-conscious as well. Intact males aren't gross, but if more than a few hours have passed since his last shower, or he's urinated recently, there might be some residual taste. That's up to you to flag him. Don't feel bad asking him to freshen up with a rinse, and tell him not to soap. Soap dries out the glans and inner foreskin, causing bad smell when they absorb urine. Water only, and never dry the glans."

Trench coat, [leather jacket](http://media.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2008/apr/indy/indy_200s-c20eab301543d37f3db8f450889906c7fc72d1a6-s2-c85.jpg), [sport coat](http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6209/6122501975_d5bde4362e_z.jpg), [western coat](http://www.cowboyshop.com/images/250_model_taupe.jpg), [peacoat](http://twi-ny.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/the-french-connection.jpg), [barn coat](http://www.johnshelleysjournal.com/js_face3.jpg), [work jacket](http://www.woolwoodandwhiskey.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/peeling-575x432.jpg), [wool overcoat](http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2012/12/Fedora-Overcoat400.jpg) all work fine.

(b) A shirt or sweater CANNOT be your outer layer with a hat.  It has to be some type of jacket.

(c) A button down shirt, tucked in unless it's summer.  Non-negotiable.  Tie is totally, 100% optional.

(d) Pants with creases.  No jeans unless you're wearing a very informal coat (western coat/work jacket/barn coat/etc) AND an [informal hat](http://www.orvis.com/store/product_search_tnail.aspx?dir_id=885&amp;group_id=22497&amp;cat_id=24994&amp;subcat_id=24999)

(e) You can wear short-brimmed straw hats with no jacket in summer, but you have to be wearing a short-sleeve print or patterned shirt.

(f) No sweaters, no t-shirts. No sneakers ever.  

(g) Match your hat to your shoes, and your shoes to the rest of the outfit.

Don't try to blend classic hats with newer trends.  A Trillby hat will never, ever match your Bills jersey, and a stroller will always clash with your North Face and New Balance.

Other styles of hats work better with more modern clothes.  Look at [Donnie Wahlberg](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/d1/cd/89/d1cd899def9e353e5c36396bcb97b6ab.jpg)'s character on ""Blue Bloods.""  He absolutely kills it with the flat cap.

Right. I'm surprised *this*, of all things, doesn't drive more of their followers away. If any TV show were as repetitive as Alex Jones, people would be mocking it and people would be ashamed to admit they watched it. It takes talent to be creative for long periods of time, and Alex Jones and his ilk simply don't have it. Their whole act is beyond stale and it's so stereotyped that even the shallowest parody is pretty close to reality.

&gt; That is why I ate up the conspiracy BS, because I had little to no knowledge of the workings of government at the time.

""Modern man lives isolated in his artificial environment, not because the artificial is evil as such, but because of his lack of comprehension of the forces which make it work- of the principles which relate his gadgets to the forces of nature, to the universal order. It is not central heating which makes his existence ‘unnatural,’ but his refusal to take an interest in the principles behind it. By being entirely dependent on science, yet closing his mind to it, he leads the life of an urban barbarian."" — Arthur Koestler

Conspiracy theories are a religion. They're a mythology with deities, monsters, and forces beyond mortal knowledge, and such a thing can only exist if you don't know how anything actually works. The modern world is inherently more complex than anything previous, which means it's harder to fully understand, but CTs as we see them here can only flourish in people who don't even make an effort."

Sometimes there are lunatics and yes, then we have to defend ourselfs against the evil someone tries to bring upon us. Defend yourself against those who try to invade your rights, your house, your land but why do you have to attack? It is one of the biggest and oldest lies ever told to man that you have to attack, when infact history shows the attacker was always wrong.

I will give you a quote to think about:

&gt; Göring: Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.

&gt;Gilbert: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.

&gt;Göring: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country."

Pros of living alone: Private space. You have everything for yourself. You don't have to wait for the bathroom or to be quiet for some reason. Just turn the music up, go in the kitchen and prepare the best meal without someone else going behind your back and all the time telling you which is right or wrong.
Cons of living alone: Noone to share with. Even if you are introvert or shy, sometimes you just need someone to listen how was your day and to get it all out for someone who bothered you on the subway or on the bus (in EU we use it all the time).

When we were living together we were always helping each other - with medicines, with alcohol, with advices.

Your mmr can't climb high enough no matter they see diamonds in their normals. 

The big thing about your placements is in what order you win/lose. STreaks are extremely good to have on the winning side where I remember my placements strated me at the normal setting and I got a win streak till I lost to higher golds. I've had win streaks that big since then and never had an mmr shift that big as a win streak in placements.

During the interview (I was basically her last chance at keeping a job at the company and I had been asked to please interview her to see if I had something for her), my impression was that she had simply been in the wrong type of job and there was something there that I could use.

I hired her. After a week she was dressed, without prompting, appropriately for the environment. I sent her on two courses and she turned out to be one of my best workers. All she needed was someone to see the potential she did have and to develop it. She was eventually promoted to a position equal to mine.

If you don't have an offsite backup, all you're protecting against is your storage physically failing (head collision on a hard drive, for example). You're not protected against fire, theft or flood.

I use Crashplan and aside from the deathly-slow upload speeds (more due to Time Warner's pathetic service in that department), I've been quite happy with it for 2 years. If you have a lot of data, you can pay $120 to have Crashplan send you a hard drive to ""seed"" your backup with - they ship a drive, you put a backup on it, send it back, they insert it into the matrix and then you just send the changes over the wire.

You can also use Crashplan to back up to external drives (for free) and other computers under your control (or your friends') (again, free). I have Crashplan backing up online as well as to an external drive attached to my wife's computer.

I'm really good friends with her boyfriend and she is decently good friends with my GF (although that has deteriorated a bit).

Both her BF and my GF have kind of accepted the situation and after the initial drama between her and my GF, everything kind of settled, although she still feels kind of guilty, but that will probably go away eventually.

The only thing that might go horribly wrong is the fact that she lives in the same hallway as me and my SO. So, when my SO gets back, things might get awkward between them. But, I'll handle that problem when it presents itself, no reason to worry about that now."

But there was just no motivation for us to keep playing after we've finished the story.

- Some of the quests were too hard for us. I remember some morse code riddle or one where you had to translate something from on Arabic language to some other language. 
- Graphics and animations weren't the best.
- Nothing to do after the story. You could either go into instances for gear that you won't need (almost no gear progression) or complete daily quests to collect skills you won't need.
- The good looking clothes were only available in the real money shop.

But I can imagine if all you do is stay home and smoke weed and then you were to suddenly stop, you'd be sitting at home *thinking about* smoking weed the whole time, which would make you think about it all day.


&gt; **Tl;dr**    If you want to stop smoking weed (or at least cut down) get something else to take its place in your schedule (e.g. going to the gym, playing sports, new hobby) - that way you won't have to constantly think about it

Loads of foreplay, stretching with fingers/toys, plenty of lube, partially penetrating and just holding still to let his/her body adjust, withdrawing and applying more lube, resisting thrusting unless absolutely sure it's safe, etc. The key is patience, slow everything down till your partner's body adjusts and get them to tell you the moment something feels painful. When everything goes to plan both of you can have an amazing time :).

You will have to accept that there will be times where it just won't seem to go in without too much pain/hassle though and the best you can hope for is something like a hand job because blowing you will probably be out of the question too. When it just won't work don't wait until you get frustrated though, try to get as much enjoyment from satisfying yourself and your partners in other ways.

It's not all bad though, sometimes I got laid simply because of my dick e.g. years ago a girl came up to me in a club and the first thing she said was ""So, I heard you've got a dick like my arm"" :D. Another thing is age, as I've gotten older and so have the ages of my partners, it's became a lot easier than before with both guys and girls :).  Look online and you'll see that shops often sell absolutely gigantic toys, so some people really enjoy that feeling of being stretched, thankfully :).

Full disclosure: I ended up asking for an epidural although I wanted to try without medication.  

I labored for about 8 hours without pain relief, while on pitocin, and no, it's not fun, but it's not unbearable.  Your body gives you lots of hormones to help you deal with the pain.   After the epidural I was in labor for 9 more hours and it was uncomfortable. I had a really light epidural though - that's another thing, you can ask for light pain relief that just takes the edge off.  There's lots of options!

And honestly, after its all done, you won't remember that labor was horrible, you'll remember how good it felt to finally birth that baby!   I mean, you'll remember that it hurt, but it will seem kind of farther away than it really was.  

As far as tearing and something going wrong, TRUST YOUR DOCTORS!  
Tearing may or may not happen but as someone who had an episiotomy and tore the recovery was not nearly as bad as I expected.   My doc gave me the episiotomy because I was starting to tear in the wrong direction. As far as things going wrong, your doctors are knowledgable and they went into medicine to help people! No, they're not infallible, but they are going to do their best to make sure you and your baby come out of labor healthy and happy.  I firmly believe that having a positive outlook going into ordeals will help the outcome seem more positive, no matter what.  

Birth is not nearly as risky as it used to be, and that's because of the ready access to medical intervention when necessary.  "

I often encountered a Hare Krishna guy who tried to sell me books, and after a while we started having little conversations that were very interesting about religion, philosophy, and the Hare Krishna faith. He was a fun guy to talk to and I learned a lot.

Until the day I asked him why I never saw any women peddling HK stuff on the streets. He said that ""although it's not impossible, it's very rare that a woman will become a monk, which is what I am.""

""Why?"" I asked, and he replied ""because women are so dirty that it is hard for them to elevate themselves enough."" All I could say was ""wait, what, why???""

That's when I heard the stupidest thing anybody ever said to me: ""well, you have a penis, right, and it gives you impure thoughts, right? So it is harder for women because they have a vagina and two breasts, so they want sex and think about sex three times more than men do! That's a lot of temptation!""

I could not contain myself. I asked, ""so you are a virgin celibate male monk who has never even had a deeper friendship with a woman, and you are trying to tell me what a woman feels based on a count of her body parts?""

Arm drag, front headlock, sit out, spinning armbar.

Arm drag for the entry, and it gives a non-scoring takedown to front headlock, so it's less likely to be defended.

Front headlock is a non-scoring position, and doubles as a finish, so defense against it is less likely to be selected by anyone as their 4 moves.

Sit out is a staple counter to the front headlock, and a sit out is also a counter to the sit out. Also a staple return to the front headlock if they attack me before I get the arm drag.

Spinning armbar is a counter to their kimura counter to my sit out."

The first statement is correct. We know this because in the Talmud (which was more or less written by Pharisees) in Mas. Makkos 7, it says a court that had an execution every 7 years was called bloodthirtsy.

Also, the stoning of the woman is completely against the way actual execution with a court works in Jewish law.

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1388929988.0,"When I met her she was very flirty and I felt we had a lot of chemistry, but she was seeing another dude. So we became friends. Then she broke up with him, and about a week later I told her that I wanted to go out with her. This is where the pattern started.

She said she didn't want to date anyone right now, and to talk to her about it ""later."" She kept up this ruse for about a month.

Then she told me that she couldn't date me because I was too much older than her. She was 17, and I was 20. I felt rejected, but had to respect her wishes. About two weeks after that she began dating a guy who was 25. I got upset, but she made some excuse that explained why she had changed her mind, and she was sorry, she totally would date me, but now she was dating this other guy.

So we remained friends. Eventually she breaks up with the 25 year old guy. I ask her out. She says its too soon. Goes on like this, then she tells me that she can't date me because I'm too fat. I'm 6'0"", 210 lbs. She's 5'10"", 145 lbs. I think she's being a bit ridiculous, but whatever. Can't hold that against her, right?

A few weeks later, she starts dating this guy who is 5'9"", 300lbs. Way, way fatter than me. Like I'm hefty, he's round. I'm like ""WTF?"" and again she explains it all.

We remain friends. She dumps the fat guy. This time I don't ask her out, she's clearly not into me. She starts flirting with me when we hang out, more and more aggressively. Like we're driving in my friends car, I'm in shotgun, she's in the back seat reaching around the headrest and stroking my ear and shit. Like really hard signal throwing. So I ask her out.

She says ""I can't date you, you use too many drugs."" I smoke pot, occasionally, it's true. I'm like what the fuck man, why is she flirting with me all the time if she doesn't want to date me? We've now been friends 4 years, I'm 22, she's 19, and I am getting sick of her shit.

I haven't had a girlfriend this whole time because I've only had eyes for her, and even when she had boyfriends she and I spent more time together than she did with them. I've just been waiting and waiting and waiting. I'm still a virgin because I'm holding out for this girl. And I'm like..okay...maybe I just have to quit smoking pot. And lose some weight. And do everything else that will finally make her happy.

Then she starts dating my dealer. MY DEALER. The guy who sells me my drugs, and uses way more and way harder drugs than I do. And finally the pattern emerges and I see it.  I see the game she has played on me.  That was the day I realized that she loved having me love her, but she didn't want to give anything back. 

I wasn't her friend, I was her fucking *minion*.

So I left.

Years later I ran into her again and she actually apologized for what had happened and admitted that she had just been stringing me along because she was, as she put it, ""reveling in her power to play with men's hearts.""

A little while ago I made a spreadsheet to see what the best readily available options were for EVs (I'm interesting in building an electric bike), Readily available supercaps seem to be on the order of $45,000 per KWh, while SLA batteries are around $180/KWh, and the 18650 Li-Ion cells are about $600/KWh. Large EV lithium cells are a nice happy medium at around $400/KWh, about twice the weight of the 18650 cells (9.9Kg/KWh vs 4.9), but less than half the weight of SLA (23.674 Kg/KWh). Of course economy of scale could change things a bit but definitely not enough to make supercaps viable right now and probably not even in the next decade.

You can download the license application from the [King County](http://www.kingcounty.gov/courts/marriage.aspx).

Fill out the forms, sign then, and have them notarized. Get a money order (about $65) and mail everything in for processing.

When you get there, you just go to the courthouse and pick up the license (during government working hours!). The site listed above does let you see the application status and there are some helpful folks you can reach via the listed contact addresses who can confirm the application status.

Once the application is processed, you have 60 days to have the marriage officiated in Washington. A Washington wedding requires two witnesses. We just brought up our best friends to be ""best man"" and ""maid of honor"" and stayed a few days longer with them in Seattle as a vacation and honeymoon.

After the wedding, the officiant takes over and within 30 days files the paperwork confirming the marriage ceremony, at which point you can receive official copies of the marriage certificate.

If you go with a Seattle wedding, then I'd recommend lining up the marriage officiant first, setting the date based on his availability, and then planning around that, giving yourself plenty of lead time for travel and wedding preparations.

If your plans are complicated at all (booking venues, photographer, reception, music, etc.), you may find a wedding planner local to Seattle to be helpful. Our plans were pretty bare bones (no booked venue; an after wedding lunch at a restaurant, no reception; a photographer) and it was still a little nerve wracking ensuring that everything went according to schedule.

Johnny_Stooge,AskReddit,1388930757.0,"I work at a cinema and this story predates me by a couple months. I was told it directly from the manager who handled the situation (as well as others that wanted to make sure I'd heard it) and I don't think I've ever heard of anything that's managed to top it.

So anyway.

At the cinema I work at we regularly come across teenagers trying to get their pash on. It's the next best place if they can't do it at home.  We really only make an issue of it if it could be distracting for the other patrons. But if things start get far too hot and heavy then we'll just kick them out.

So one day a fellow staff member walks into a cinema to do a check. They walk up the stairs and see these two 14 - 16 year olds just smashing their faces together and throwing hands underneath clothing that's not their own. BOOM. They're pulled up and kicked out of the cinema.

However, because they're underage and not with their parents we're legally not allowed to let them leave the premises until we notify their parents. Duty of Care and all that. So the two kids are taken into the office where the manager asks for the phone numbers of their parents and it's at that point they start shitting themselves. They practically begging the manager not to call their parents, on the verge of tears. No kid wants to get in trouble for something like that. Understandable. It's just embarrassing. But apparently this kind of begging and pleading was beyond that. So the manager lays it out straight for them - ""Ok. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't call your parents.""


""We're cousins.""


Well nobody wants to deal with that kind of shit. So they just let the kids go and told them to stay clear of the cinema for a couple of months."

Why do women insist on dong things like this when they're trying to get a guy to do something? It just comes across as weak and whiny nagging. Take a harder line and tell him to just fucking get them done already. He'd be more willing to consider interacting more with the outside world if he's not viewed a a freak by everyone else.

&gt;He spends the whole time in school and doesn't want to talk to me. He plays video games on his computer endlessly.

He doesn't need therapy like everyone's saying here, he's normal. He plays the games as a form of escapism,  retreat from his shitty reality. Plenty of teenage boys do this.

&gt;I even tried playing with him but he said he doesn't want to play with me... He is a very good student and I am pleased with that but I don't get it. 

It's good that you're trying to relate to him on his own level but you'll probably find boys in their mid teens who want to play with their mothers are the exception, he's not your little baby anymore, give the poor guy some space and stop mothering him. Just let him know that he can talk to you frankly and about anything. He'll talk if and when he's ready to do so, let him do this shit on his terms, don't try to force it.

&gt;I never hear him talk with his friends on his phone, he never has friends over, and I'm damn sure he hasn't had a girlfriend. He became like this ~2 years ago, he was never shy, always confident and now what happened. Now on his winter break I don't think he has contact with other people that aren't me.

wufoo2,sex,1388931656.0,"My wife and I used this technique while she was nursing our babies, when vaginal secretions tend to dry up:

1. Roll your foreskin closed.
2. While she holds her labia open, press the puckered foreskin between them.
3. Holding your foreskin sealed against her labia, push your hips forward so your glans goes directly into her vagina.
4. With the foreskin still sealed, pull your hips back so your glans retreats into your foreskin.
5. Repeat until her lubrication is distributed all over your glans and inner foreskin. You'll feel it when this happens.
6. Let go, and do what nature drives you to do.

Your foreskin will adjust automatically to her lubricative abilities. The only time, in my experience, when intercourse hurts is when I start too eagerly and outrun the lubricant, overstretching my foreskin."

I'm not saying it's all perfect for my SO, but she's actually dealing with it a lot better than I thought she would have.

I still get along really well with the BF though, he even came back home for a week for the holidays and I saw him then, and although I have to admit it was hard to look him in the eyes at first, other than that, things were fine.

The point I was making though was that the FWB situation works between me and the girl, because we would never develop feelings for each other and it's mainly about the easy sex.

As for her not wanting to lose me. If she told me flat out that she wants me to stop, I would. It would just be a really hypocritical move on her part. And I wouldn't break up with her over that, obviously."

Put on the dishes and add some of the remaining cheese on top, use some course ground black pepper if you're into that sort of thing. Serve with a bottle of pinot grigio.

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1388931948.0,"I got into a shouting match with a guy at a party, Brett.  I had just broken up with a girl a month earlier, and was still bummed, and had been drinking.  This guy tried to cheer me up by explaining to me that what I felt for this girl -- whom he never met and never saw me interact with -- was not love, merely lust, and that someday I would experience real love like he had.  Except he was a 26 year old virgin whose ""girlfriend"" was a girl from Singapore he only knew over the internet. So it kind of pissed me off that he was acting like he knew the difference between lust and real love.

My roommate/old friend managed to stop it before it got out of hand, and since the party was at our place, he got thrown out.  And that should have been the end of it.  My buddy was talking me down, trying to get me to cool off, and then this idiot starts yelling.  He's standing outside our apartment, which is one of eight bungalows around a common courtyard, at midnight, and he's screaming.  What's he screaming?  ""YOU MOTHERFUCKER! I'M GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU!"" Over and over again.  Going to wake up everyone.

So I'm standing there, eyes, down, trying to cool off, my buddy is standing right in front me, has his hand on my shoulder, giving me the ""Just relax, deep breath, calm down"" speech and we both hear the yelling.  I look up, look at my buddy, and he just shrugs and steps back, holding his hands up.  Because he knows this not acceptable.

So I walk outside, don't say anything, just start walking straight for him.  He's still screaming as I'm walking towards him, but his body language is all ""I'm afraid"".  And I say ""You're gonna motherfucking kill me, Brett?"" and I say it real, real calmly, but my eyes are not even a little bit calm.  

And you can see it in his face as he realizes his mistake. That I'm 4 inches taller and 50 pounds heavier than him.  That I've been in dozens of fights and was raised by a crazy alcoholic Green Beret, and I'm not even a little afraid of getting violent.  And that he is a little tiny pussy who has never been in a fight that didn't occur across the internet.

So he tries to run.  But this all occurs to him far too late.

I reach out and grab the back of his collar as he turns to run, and I pull him back and whip him to the ground. He's screaming and crying ""I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"" but I so don't fucking care if he's sorry.  There is no turning back now.  This ends when I can no longer stop swinging my fists or someone pulls me off him.  That it ends when he's dead is not a guarantee.  I am in the ""beat on you til you die then beat on your corpse"" zone.

He's on the ground, I straddle him, and just start punching him in the face. Left, right, left, right, left, right.  He puts up his arms to lessen the blows, but that only last the first dozen punches.  By the time I've hit him twenty times he's no longer resisting.

That's when my roommate -- even larger than me -- grabs me and picks me up off the ground.  Several of the girls at the party surround me and I snap out of it.  Someone checks on Brett.  He's alive, conscious, but bawling like a baby.  He runs off crying.

We go inside.  Everyone is kind of like...whoa.  Several people are surprised, not realizing I had that side.  The guys all agree that was pretty much the definition of ""he was asking for it"" and ""should've seen that coming.""

Little later there's a knock on the door.  It's a cop.  He and I talk.  I tell him what Brett was screaming, several people confirm.  Cop is like ""Well, why don't you two stay away from each other from now on then.""  I ask if Brett's okay, because you know, now I feel a little bad.  Cop just gives me a flat ""No."" then says ""His face looks like hamburger.""

The next day my hand hurts like hell.  Go to the doctor, turns out I have a compression fracture.  Ask him if I could do that punching someone.  Doc says no.

we work out what happened:  When I grabbed Brett's collar and threw him to the ground, the cloth wrapped around my ring and middle finger, then tightened enough that the tip of my ring finger just broke.

Doc told me it would be $450 to put it in a cast, but the break was so clean I just used some Popsicle sticks and duct tape.

To this day I can feel the weather change as a throb in my ring finger."

Cykuta,thatHappened,1388932074.0,"""Women want this"" ""women want that"" ""women say one thing but mean another"" - do you realise how silly you sound saying things like that?

Just exchange ""women"" with any other arbitrary, non-elective trait. ""Short men are bitter"", ""blond people will take singing, good or bad, over any dancing antics"" ""Americans claim they want freedom because they're afraid and ashamed to admit they really long for dictatorship.""

At their core, these kind of attitudes - TRP, PUA, or just general assholery - have one problem: they put as a basic rule that WHAT you are determines WHO you are. And that's just not true, plain and simple.

I can understand how you see merit in these things. You've found your manual that tells you, if you press this button, this action will happen. I can see how tempting that is in a multi-faceted, un-obvious world of social interaction. I can even see how this can bring some ""results"" for you. But what you actually get is like makeup over an oozing abscess: it looks good, but there's a putrid disgusting mass underneath that your generalizations have just exposed.

I joined the Navy and managed to be a sand Sailor for almost 10 years. I got plenty of time in hairy situations, fire fights, mortars, rpgs, and 6 IEDs. I've seen some shit right ... I got on the MV Kellie Chouest in Greece back in December of 2010 to provide protection during a routine transit of the Suez and the pirate infested waters after that. 

The Chouest was a civilian ship that had been contracted by the military to do some shit with subs. It's got a 14ft draught and isn't very big. We left on a sunny but cold day making are way through the med towards Egypt. There was a storm brewing and it built up gradually, the swells and the wind and rain. The boat started rocking about 2 days into the voyage and everyone was sea sick I felt like a champ again ... until about 12 hours when we got to the heart of the beast. 40 foot swells. The ship would rock so hard to either side I thought for sure we would capsize. I went up to the bridge because I figured the captain's calmness would soothe me. The atmosphere of terror on the bridge did no such thing. I watched the ship lean so far too the port after a huge wave that the raised helo deck got smashed by another wave and shook the ship so violently the mate on watch started praying outloud for the ship to come back to the starboard. A crane broke loose and was swinging wildly about the deck smashing into things. I heard frantic distress calls on the radio as the captain told the mate to prepare the crew with EEBDs and immersion suits. We wouldn't last minutes in the water. He told me to have my crew pull our suits and EEBDs and put them on and get on the O3 with quick release straps tie ourselves to the rail because WHEN the ship tipped over we'd get pinned to the roof because the suits are so buoyant so we had to strap ourselves down activate the EEBD and pray we found our way to the surface before the air ran out. I was terrified, we'd never been trained to do that. So we sat on deck for another 6 hours waiting for that last big wave to tip us over. It never came but those 6 hours still give me nightmares. We made it out of the storm that killed like 33 people and sank 3 ships. We got lucky as hell. Fuck being at the mercy of the sea, I'd rather be shot at any day. Being a Sailor ain't for me ... I don't know how those guys do it."
paratactical,AskWomen,1388932182.0,"I've had other people that had, uh, unique physical attributes that made them insecure or otherwise caused them grief. The ones with whom I had the best and longest lasting relationships told me that they wanted to take getting physical slowly because they had personal issues and insecurities. If I liked them and we really clicked, at some point before hooking up we would have a conversation about what their concerns were. I completely understand why most people wouldn't be comfortable with this and why it's not an easy thing to do. I also think that the upfront candor is something that is best for people wanting a relationship with me - after the last few days of conversation, I don't think that's true for most or all women. I don't handle surprises well and that's my problem, not yours.

I'm also surprised after these threads because it seems that I had underestimated how common big bends and bends to the left and the right were. I think that if I were in the same situation again, knowing what I know now, I would probably have reacted very differently.

I also think that a lot of posters are right - I'm probably not as open-minded and dtf as I would like to think and the right person for you will not reject you beause of it."

If you want to add the ""r"" for registered trademark then you need to go through the several month long + x thousand $ process to get there, but it will make your product watertight. Of course, if someone does infringe on your trademark, you'll then have to have the resources to defend yourself. IMO it makes no sense to register the trademark if you don't have the resources to defend it legally, cause clearly at that stage your registered trademark isn't worth anything, and nobody is going to copy it to the extent that you'd have to start getting worried. Unless you think it will go from zero to hero overnight, don't bother registering.

I had spent several years wrapped up in this bullshit relationship with girl, then another year just being mad, then I went out with the intent of having sex with the first woman who would let me put my dick in her.

Very quickly I met a girl who was 23 and also a virgin, though I didn't tell her I was one.  I basically just pretended to be someone I totally wasn't, someone who was into everything she was into.  Every manipulative trick to get someone to like and trust you, I used.  From the moment we met, I just played her.  Because I was so pissed at that other girl, and felt like I had been wasting my life, that I just focused on one thing.  Got to get laid.

On our first date I told her I didn't have sex on the first date,  and that seemed to turn her on because she wanted to have sex right then.  So we did, because everything I said to her was bullshit.  That was followed up by a week of midnight booty calls.

By the end of the week I realized I wasn't into her at all and that we had nothing in common but a mutual desperate need to get laid, and I broke up with her. I had zero actual attraction to her.  I tried to be nice about it, but she cried a lot and was clearly devastated.

And on that day, I realized what a complete and total fucking asshole I actually am, and how very shitty of a human being I can be.  So I regret that.  Because I wish I didn't know that about me."

This is a third party website so they don't know how to market it, but anyone familiar with the brand will know. I know cause I'm an editor for a fashion magazine. But to be honest I'm surprised that it's at $85. Usually their t shirts retail for a lot more than that, possibly cause I'm used to the European pricing.

Edit: I'm not saying it's worth $85. I'm saying that it is worth $85 to a subset of shoppers, and that's all that matters to Acne.

Edit 2: I can go into a little more detail. Things like the length of the shirt, the shape of the sleeve ends, the length of the sleeves, the type of collar, the slimness yet not skinniness (the body type it is made for), all combined make it more special to people who really care about the details.

Cykuta,thatHappened,1388932823.0,"You'll find that everywhere. All these stories of uppity feminist businesswomen suddenly turning out submissive and begging for a master. Rape victims starting to like it mid-rape. (Women in general discovering their ""true nature"" as cumdumpsters is one of the oldest tales, because navigating between raging lust and respect for another person is hard so a lot of guys wish they didn't have to.) I'm sure there are more tales of lesbians being turned straight by a magic dickwand than we could imagine.

On the flip side, you get the fantasies about strong and aggressive people turning gentle and vulnerable - usually college jocks, dangerous bikers, powerful sorceresses. 

It's simple, really: lust is a powerful force that grips the person who does the lusting, and often changes us for a while (making reckless decisions when horny etc) so we wish for it to influence the target of that lust equally strongly. I think. For gay people I'd say this is an even more potent narrative because you need to factor in the social stigma, which stirs things up for both sides: coming out about lusting for someone of the same sex can still be dangerous, so one feels one's sex drive makes one go to even bigger extremes, and one wishes it to be mirrored by something transgressive on the other side. I think."

It’s a common misconception that, the higher the anti-aliasing multiplier, the smoother your game will appear. But as you’re about to see with NVIDIA’s CSAA, that isn’t always the case. If you recall, CSAA is optimized to look very similar to MSAA, but place less load on your GPU by sampling fewer colors per coverage area. This is great in terms of performance, but can result in decreased color accuracy and video quality. Thus, for those wanting the best of both worlds, there is a special ‘Q’ option under certain CSAA modes. 8xQ CSAA, for example, increases the number of color samples from four back to eight – just as you’d get with 8xMSAA – but with less of a performance hit.

hennypen,Parenting,1388932873.0,"Look, my one year old screamed every time I put her on her tummy.  She told over a month or so late, crawled a couple months later than other babies I know, and it's absolutely fine.  Tummy time is great, so just keep working on it.  Barring serious injury, there's nothing you've done to really mess up your kid yet.  Kids are resilient.  Sometimes I think that the worst think you can do for your baby is feel like a failure.  It's so hard the first few months because you get so little response.  It gets easier. 

 Just keep trying a few minutes of tummy time once or twice a day, try to read a board book once a day, and try to take a few minutes every day to just focus on love.  And don't worry too much if you miss something, even if you realize you've gone a few days without tummy time. 

 Babies have been fine in much worse situations, and everybody finds the first few months hard and exhausting, and your baby doesn't entirely feel like a person yet, but a needy little alien.  It gets easier.  Just feed your baby, say ""I love you"" every day, and hang in there."
PoliticoG,AskMen,1388932876.0,"Not me but my dad: 
Note: I don't know the whole story, but this is what I've been able to put together. 


My dad's first wife had just left him for his best friend, they'd been screwing for a while. Needless to say, my dad was crushed. A bit of a temper runs through the family, as does intelligence. 

The house my dad's ex and his friend were staying at was one my dad had worked on extensively (he's a builder). One night, when the ex wife was out of town, my dad snuck in. 

The best friend woke up with a handgun to his face. My dad, from what I've discerned, told him to stop fucking his ex wife and to get out of town. If he didn't, my dad would end his life. If he went to the police, my dad would take him down before the cops even showed up and be 50 miles away with a provable alibi. 

In the end, my dad's ex found out and called the police, but the guy was so utterly scared that he never told a soul what happened. 

The only thing my dad has said about this was when I was telling him that I plan to get my concealed carry permit. He said ""I don't like handguns anymore. Too easy to carry around.Too easy to wave at people."" "

luculentlady,explainlikeimfive,1388932971.0,"Well, a torrent is a pointer file that stores 'metadata' (you'll have look that up on your own) that programs like uTorrent use to download data to your PC. A torrent is created inside programs like uTorrent and it stores tracker url, name and directory of your file(s), info pieces (splitting file into small pieces to be shared), hash list which is a list of all these pieces, the piece length and quite a bit more. 
The annoying thing here is that your downloading a file is subject to the uploading speeds that the other people allow and the availability of the pieces of the file. 

For example, if I made a torrent available and only three people downloaded half of it then I made it unavailable then you tried to come and download it from them, well, you'd only get the half that they got from me...thankfully, that's basically leeching. 

Thankfully though, people always seed until people have downloaded from them 100% or until they have earned a certain upload vs download ratio.

As I was cuffing him up and putting him in the squad car he was bawling his eyes out and crying lakes, he told me to listen, if even for a second to his story, so I did. 

He had a hard time growing up, often getting made fun of for his size and his general awkwardness. Until he took up swimming and got fit, he was the laughing stock of his whole high school, and eventually caved in to the pressure of drugs. Unfortunately, old habits die hard and that's what led to me catching him with the Marijuana. He went on and said that due to his drug addiction he owed the wrong amount of money to the wrong types of people, and he had a whole paranoid story about how people were constantly trying to find him, although somehow he stayed out of their sight. 

He was crying throughout the whole story, and as we approached the station and I tried to console him, tell him that Marijuana possession wasn't so bad, well, that's when he asked the question. ""Hey... hey officer, can I- I- have about tree fiddy?"". That's when I realised that this 16 year old kid was actually a giant crustacean from the paleolithic era!

Megaross,AdviceAnimals,1388933477.0,"I wouldn't get married anyway, I don't see the need, whether you're married or not makes no actual difference to the outcome of a relationship.

The fact you need to validate your ability to stay together forether in front of an audience is surely no good start to a lasting relationship, love is love, a ring won't change the outcome. It's not about passivity, it's about compatability, it's the foundation, rare are the foundations that will allow a meaningful relationship to sit on top without it crumbling and falling apart, and the two people desperately trying to keep it up because ""hey, it's better than nothing""

I'm perfectly comfortable with me, and I'm perfectly capable of forming a healthy relationship. However I really don't see the point unless it's going to last, and it probably isn't, why spend your life constantly filling cracks in the foundation of something which won't last?

People aren't simple, the entire idea that someone could stay with someone else for 50 years is fine, what I take issue with is the concept that most people who settle down are actually happy after 10-20 years. 

Realistically they could probably find someone better at every stage in their life, odds of one person being enough forever are slim to none, this isn't disney, people don't live happily ever after and if part of your life isn't as good as it could be, why shouldn't you replace it?

Even though you're settled down I guarantee there is someone out there who would be better for you, make you happier, give your life more reason. It's simple probability."

Now let's imagine you join a private server that lets you set your level to whatever you want. Suddenly 70 is not a big deal anymore because you can get it in a blink of an eye.

I'm mostly Sapiosexual, which means I like smart guys, incredibly smart guys. Preferably geniuses. Though I also consider looks and personality, intelligence is the main factor of attraction for me.

Long story short, this means I end up dating some ugly (but brilliant) guys.

I get a lot of crap for this. People just don't get that I really don't care as much as they do about looks. Seriously, people will take me aside and be like ""You know you're really pretty right? and that you could do a lot better than [insert name of guy I'm dating]"" or ""How are you attracted to him?"" and ""You know [insert random boy name] is really hot and he likes you. You should date him instead.""

The worst part is that any time a guy sees me with my boyfriend they automatically assume that since they are better looking (or think they are better looking) than my boyfriend it will be really easy to get me to leave (or cheat on) my boyfriend for them and so they try to do this incessantly and will not give up. And, of course, this typically makes whoever I'm dating and actually want to be with very uncomfortable.

That is not to say that I don't think handsome guys are physically attractive. I still like muscles and six packs and pretty faces and can stare at them all day but unless they come with brains I'm not at all romantically or sexually interested."

Iamyourbetter,AdviceAnimals,1388934035.0,"In the United States state and local governments have a considerable amount of power by design. Meaning they can set up their own taxes. Not only do sales taxes vary from state to state but they will vary from county to county. Virginia is even more complicated because the cities here are separate from the counties, and they're usually located inside county boundaries. So what you end up with us a distinct government *within* a distinct government; within a small region taxes can change by a little bit and you may not notice you left one area for another.

But you can't just move to Delaware or Oregon to not pay sales tax. States have to make up that missing revenue, and in those states you'll probably see an increase in payroll, income, or property taxes.

I think the reason retailers don't place the post-tax prices of goods on their products is because it would be a production and delivery nightmare. It'd be really complicated to keep changing and tracking different priced batches of clothing from factory to store.

As an American I know this how our system works and I have the common sense to expect a slightly higher price than advertised. I'm not saying it's a convenient system, but unless there is a universal change in tax law at the federal level, the states and counties will continue to have a say in their taxation because it is their right."

whitneyface,neopets,1388934365.0,"First of all, thank you so much /u/labpartnerincrime for the pretty graphs. I only provided the numbers for those.

So! I gambled! I used 500 green, 500 red, and 500 blue Neocola tokens. I won many in my daily Battledoming, but bought most of them. When I started buying, I would only buy them if they were under 400 nps. By the end of my experiment I was impatient and bumped my buying price to anything at or under 420 nps. 

When using the tokens, I put all of each color in my inventory and went to the Neocola Machine. I picked a random cola and number of button pushes. Then I did that for a while while watching a TV show. Then I changed the flavor and number of buttons. There was no rhyme or reason to it. At the end I tallied the results and discarded a shitload of junk. If you don't yet have the Rubbish avatar, doing Neocola Tokens can be an extra good thing!

As for results, it TOTALLY paid off. I got two Gelert and one Poogle Transmogrification Potion! Even if I paid 420nps for each token, I only paid 630k for them. People seem to be asking 3.5 mill for the Poogle Transmogrification Potion on the TP. The Gelert looks more like 950k. In theory, I've made over a 4.5 million NP profit. I haven't actually sold any of them yet.

The bad news: tokens aren't as cheap now as they were when I started buying. And if we all start buying them now, they'll stay pricy. Also, I think I got REALLY lucky with my Transmogrification Potions. I got a brand new, popular color. There are only a few more expensive than that, and a lot that are cheaper. The Gelert was a lucky one, too. If I had spent 630k and gotten three cheap (Moehog/Buzz/Blumaroo/Grarrl/Elephante/Meerca/Mynci, etc) Transmogrification Potions, I would have taken a loss.

I tried to do more tokens than I've seen tried at one time, and sort them by color. The number of prizes received was still so low as for this not to be representative at all. I'll be doing more of this in the future, probably not 1500 at a time, probably just as I win them and see them cheaply on the SSW. 

Thank you again /u/labpartnerincrime for making everything pretty and mathy! Thank you /r/neopets for encouraging me to try these tokens! High fives all around!"

I'm pretty comfortable just being me so I don't feel self conscious in that regard but then again I've never been the kind of person that cares what others think of me and am not very girly and usually pair a cute skirt with sneakers and a more casual shirt . I dress very comfortably but still get comments on how nicely I dress and how feminine I look so I think sometimes it just has to do with how you carry yourself.

I3lind5pot,videos,1388934537.0,"In junior hight school, I got bullied by a group of 13 guys. Every day after school, they would wait for me outside school, because there, no teacher could defend me. At first only insults, later they beat me up, all at once.

I started to leave first so they won't catch me outside. I would sprint home for 15 minutes to feel safe.

At the same time, I joined a karate class. I told my sensei what was happening and he gave me extra lessons on street fighting once a week.

On day, I was not able to leave class first as I had to talk to the teacher about an exam I had written in her class. The consequence, they were waiting outside school again.

This was the time I decided to stop this shit! I dared them to fight me one at a time. If they were real men, they would fight me one by one!

The loudest (and smallest) one shouted first. The most annoying fuck. He felt safe in the group. Charged at me, I turned his sloppy attack, grabbed his arm, pulled him to the floor and punched him in the face. So hard, I did not know I was capable of doing that. His nose was broken.

The next one charged, got beaten down too. I was standing in the middle of a closed circle, waiting for the next one to come. But no one came...

Their ""leader"" decided to let me go. From that day on, they didn't beat me up. The verbal attacks didn't stop for the next 2 years, but I was fine dealing with those.

This turned out long, but the moral of the story? Learn to fight back. You are not always as lucky as this girl in the video. It is reality, many people don't give a fuck about laws, be prepared.

tl;dr: read it or leave it

What?

When you battle someone, you're not trying to see which player is better at breeding or training or whatever. There are exactly two things that you're trying to find out: Which player is better at teambuilding, and which player is better at battling.

Now, there has been a shift. The Middle classes are squeezed and there is now a big chunk of the market that was once loyal to Waitrose and M and S looking to buy elsewhere.

Artikeln handlar om hur vissa ser på arbetarklassen som en grupp där rasistiska åsikter är överrepresenterade och att verkligheten inte är så enkel.

Att hänvisa till en fiktiv ""pop/kulturvänster"" som styr mainstream media är inget mer än en konspirationsteori. Kritiken mot ""invandringskritiker"" är oberoende höger-vänsterskalan till stor del, på samma sätt som ""invandringsskeptiker"" menar att invandringskritiken inte kan sättas in på den samma. 

Folks åsikter om Löfven behöver inte höra till en viss ideologi, utan kan vara ren ogenomtänkt idioti. Alla oavsett hudfärg/kön kan utsättas för rasism/sexism och alla oavsett hudfärg/kön har samma möjligheter att kritisera frågor som berör samma områden.

Generally cats are very clean themselves so bathing isn't always necessary, and if you get them some things to scratch and train them properly not to scratch your furniture then you shouldn't need to trim the claws. (I have never bathed my cats and I don't remember my mom ever bathing the cats we had growing up. All I do is the occasional brushing.) The vet recommended that I brush her teeth but there's no way she would ever let me do that. 

Annual check-ups are good and the rabies vaccine, which is required by law in most places I think, should be updated every year (there is a three year option but my vet told me that this option has been associated with some negative side effects.)

Are you saying charitable organizations can organize and raise funds for a pickup of a hurricane-ravaged city the size of new orleans? New york? The reality is that they don't have the organizational power or financial backing to accomplish great feats.

It's good you brought up the internet, because that was developed by the government. And a lot of the infrastructure is still run by the government. Reddit likewise isn't a good comparison because in reddit everyone has an unlimited supply of upvotes they can give, they are just capped at one per comment.

Likewise these comments about how kluwe would feel if you stole all half his money. First of all he already pays that much in taxes, and he still feels that way! Second he's involved in the decision making process. Third is that it's not just your money. The infrastructure the government built was necessary for you to get the job that paid you that money, you ignore your communuty if you think no one deserves the money you make except you. Police, fire trucks, roads, power grid, military, education, all of these are necessary for our economy and everyone benefits from them. 

Also I hate the concept that money isn't coercive. Yes it is. If I have to work x job to make enough money to survive, I am being coerced. I suppose I theoretically have the choice to get more qualifications or find another job or starve and be homeless, but it's not uncommon that those first two options arent possible for people."

I do think that I can live it out, but as mentioned above, it'll be at the expense of having a family, most likely.

My fiancé and I just bought a house together... we both want to travel, but getting to actually do so will take a little longer, still.

We're hoping to eventually be able to take one trip every year, and one ""big"" (read: expensive) trip every 4 years. And we're also talking about possibly moving to another country altogether when we retire, 30-ish years from now.

I also tend to be a believer that the system works much better with two robust political parties going at the issues aggressively. I don't really want to live in a world where some whackadoodle on the far right can get rid of birth control or some bleeding heart hippie can attempt to abolish any concept of wealth.

ANewMachine615,badhistory,1388935933.0,"So, the King family sued a guy named Loyd Jowers for civil conspiracy. You see, the Kings don't believe that Ray was guilty of the murder. They alleged in the civil case that Jowers had worked with the federal government and local police to kill King, and that James Earl Ray was a patsy. Jowers apparently corroborated parts of this, claiming that he had been hired by the Mafia to kill MLK, and that the person who fired the shot was a Memphis police officer.

The King family's suit was successful because of the ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard. Basically, a jury is supposed to consider only the evidence before them. In a civil case, the question is whether the evidence before them makes it more likely than not that a given thing occurred. So, if you were on a jury and presented with a bunch of photographs of a green sky, you would be obligated to find that the sky was in fact green.^(1) Jowers's defense didn't do much in the way of debunking or challenging the King family's narrative (the lawyer at one point said he agreed with 80% of the theory), and Jowers himself did not testify in his defense. Thus, based on the limited evidence available and the poor quality of the defense, the Kings were successful, and awarded $100 restitution (they said to prove they were only doing it for the truth). [This article has a very bare-bones account](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/09/us/memphis-jury-sees-conspiracy-in-martin-luther-king-s-killing.html). Basically the government never got to present a defense of itself, because they only considered Jowers's defense, which didn't challenge the Kings on most points.

The Justice Department [has investigated the case and found Jowers's claims to be contradictory and lacking evidence or corroboration](http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/mlk/part2.php).

^(1) This is actually a rather silly example, and not true, but it gets the point across. A jury is allowed to rely on their common sense and experience, but not on evidence of specific facts of which they themselves have no personal knowledge. This is why juries are often prevented from viewing TV news or the like during a trial -- to prevent the introduction of outside evidence into their considerations. Whether it works is a different story."

MightySasquatch,Foodforthought,1388935959.0,"You missed the point of his post, he wasn't criticizing the existence of currency he was.highlighting the difference between positive and negative freedom. Negative freedom is freedom from being prevented from  doing something, you have freedom to do something if no one tells you you can't. Negative freedom tends to be emphasized in a libertarian society. No one is stopping you from most things you want to do (other than violate others property rights), and you get to keep most of your money. However, limitations on job availability and the need to pay for food and housing means that many people are forced to stay in the same position, working a job they don't like in order to stay alive.

Positive freedom on the other hand looks  at the situation and says, you have the freedom to do something if you have the actual realistic ability to do it. So in this case, a socialist society might tax everyone more and then provide food, shelter, medicine, and education to everyone and say that they're providing more freedom because, while people keep a smaller share of their earnings, most people ultimately have more freedom because they have the ability to pursue their dreams and education."

vidurnaktis,AskReddit,1388936375.0,"Well firstly, you're a tool. Secondly, you're conflating *Style* and *Dialect*. Dialects exist only in speech, Styles exist in writing and are not something we linguists are generally concerned with (e.g. having a standardised style of writing ain't a bad thing). 

And you obviously are talking about AAVE (albeit in a way that shows you don't understand what a dialect is). A dialect is a variety of a language with distinctive pronunciation, grammar and lexical items that is internally consistent (that is the speakers use their grammar in the same way consistently, or at least until something changes). 

As /u/alynnidalar wrote, you can't compare the AAVE of Twain's day to the AAVE of now. Much like you can't compare the GenAm of today to the SAmE of Twain's day. No one talks of fourscore anymore, instead we talk of eighty. What even is a fortnight? More like two weeks. We have computers and radios and televisions galore. And just like material and other concerns of changed for SAmE speakers they've changed for AAVE speakers as well. Rap, and hip-hop culture, didn't exist until the 70s for instance (and gang-banger culture within hip-hop culture is late 80s). 

There is also no such thing as ""bad grammar"", there is a thing as illiteracy but even speakers of the standard can be illiterate. A native speaker of a language will always (barring some other deficiency) innately know their language, or to connect it to writing some people write the homophones your/you're the same, it isn't that they're switching one for the other because intuitively they understand the difference but that they confuse the graphical representation because as stated earlier those are homophones for the vast majority. 

In closing, go read a book on linguistics and then head on over to /r/asklinguistics to learn yourself something. 

(I'm also a native speaker of AAVE, y'know being black and raised in a community which spoke it, so as both an AAVE speaker and a linguist I take exception to the way y'all portray those of us who were raised with it.)"

And live out the rest of your days unsatisfied, but still somewhat comfortable in what you've always known.

I was told ""Wherever you go - there you are."" It means that you can't escape who you are. You can't change yourself by running to a new place. If you don't change yourself first, you will always find the same things, the same kind of people, and end up in the same situation. But after reading your story, I don't think it's as cut and dry as all that. It seems changing place can in fact be a catalyst in changing yourself.

testudinidae,exjw,1388936604.0,"Just a few thoughts for you:

- Do your parents pay your cell phone bill?  If so, they can most likely get a copy of all your texts whether or not they have your physical phone.  Be careful.

- You're still living at home.  Think really hard about the best way to handle this.  You saw what happened to your brother.  It may be best to keep playing along for a few years and save up some money until you can get on your feet and be on your own.  These are going to be stressful years.  Seek help here when you need it.  Keep /r/exjw off your internet history at your home computer.

- Evolution is FASCINATING stuff.  Pick up a copy of Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene at the library and prepare to be blown away.  I was a biology student in college, and everything about the structure of life is so needlessly complex and confusing -- until you look at it through the lens of evolution, which brings everything into simple, elegant focus.  The most profoundly rewarding and (dare I say?) spiritual experience of my life has been wrapping my mind around the science of life.

- Stay close with your brother.  Steal time away to have lunch with him.  He'll be hesitant at first to sway you, but talk to him about what you're learning and the resources you've found.  You need each other.

- Read the [Exit Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/wiki/index#wiki_exit_guide) from the sidebar.  Reading what a lot of us have learned the hard way will save you a lot of grief."
gametemplar,boardgames,1388936607.0,"Let me start off by saying that the army colors shouldn't be too much of an issue. In addition to each of the armies have unique colors - Deep red, dark grey, tan/beige, orange, and green - each had unique molds to represent the units used by that power; e.g., every power's tanks look like the tanks they used in the war. Even for color-blind players, the units should be easily identifiable at a glance.

I grew up playing Axis &amp; Allies, and I've played just about every edition since the old big box from the 80s. I have a lot of fond memories of the game, but I can't really recommend it any more. As mentioned elsewhere, A&amp;A is a long game with lots of downtime between players' turns, unless you're playing with only 2 players. This is less of an issue for the Axis players (Japan &amp; Germany) as they are usually involved in combat most rounds, but for the Allies it can be a real problem, since they may be only dealing with a single front or a few territories against one of the Axis players. There are also other problems with this, which I'll address below.

There's also the problem of repetition. In order to play effectively, you have to play out what actually happened in the war (more or less). This is to say that the Russians and the Germans will end up fighting in Eastern Europe, the US and the UK will harass the Germans constantly to gain foothold on the continent while Japan wages war in the Pacific to stave off the juggernaut that is the United States. Depending on die rolls, tactics may change from game to game, but the overall strategy is the same: the USSR needs to hold off the German assault long enough for the USA and UK to gain ground in Europe. Japan will sweep through the Pacific, trying to gain enough territory to keep their war machine running, while the US needs to balance their forces between the Pacific and European theaters. Germany starts strong and needs to keep their momentum going long enough to eliminate one of the Allies before they can build up a defense. You get the idea. Going against history almost always ends poorly.

This is where the game becomes a problem. It's fun to try new things and different tactics at first, but eventually (assuming you play with any sort of regularity) players will have favored powers, preferred tactics, and perfected their opening moves, which are arguably the most important plays of the game. The first few turns are very exciting as the players' starting forces clash but again, barring any amazing die rolls these will play out the same almost every time, especially as you play more and refine your strategies. After the first two turns, if one side hasn't made a significant breakthrough it quickly becomes a long grind as powers wear away at each other. There is also a problem (notably with the USSR) of having to play a defensive game just to hold off the aggressor to stay in the game. This requires a player to essentially build new units and move them to the front in an attempt to stall the offensive long enough for an ally to save you. In a multi-player game where this is your only viable option, it will become boring very quickly.

Ultimately, Axis &amp; Allies suffers from several problems. Any good game should allow a player to make interesting choices each turn, and often certain tactics/units will be the best option and it rarely rewards experimental play. It's a long game, with lots of downtime as you add more players, and player elimination is a very real thing. Furthermore, Axis &amp; Allies really rewards multiple plays, but playing enough to really refine a strategy can be difficult and requires at least one other opponent as dedicated to the game as you are. 

**TL; DR** - Axis &amp; Allies is a very good lighter wargame without resorting to hex &amp; counter wargames. But it is bound by the historic conflict, which means is less of a game and more of a simulation or reenactment. It's long, suffers from lots of downtime, has player elimination, and lacks any significant meaningful decisions. **It really does *not* hold up to modern board games.** As a World War II game encompassing the entire theater of war, it does a fine job of being an accessible wargame. If you have any experience with modern board games at all, you most likely will not be satisfied with Axis &amp; Allies unless you have a passion for WWII."

Cykuta,AskReddit,1388936659.0,"I just wanted to pitch in with some perspective from the other side. Now, in no way I am saying this is how OP acted (comforting one's son *only because it may lead to sex* would be some serious scumbaggery), but if you guys can bear with me for a moment:

I had an ""ulterior motive"" boyfriend. A guy whom I had to *persuade* to shower before bed (he thought it was cute in a childish way, and maybe for him it was. For me it was exasperating and stupid and a huge turnoff. If I'd wanted a child I would get pregnant), a man who thought conversation should not happen in a healthy relationship because talking is for problems. A man who thought dates and ""date-ish"" things like flowers or dressing nice were only to get a woman interested at the start.

My sex drive is huge, so it took some time to dwindle when we moved in together. But boy did it dwindle. And yes, he did put some ""effort"" into getting sex, but it was just so plainly, blatantly obvious that he'd taken the most primitive way to do it. He took out the perfume bottle I gave him a year before and started using it - but he'd use it literally seconds before he'd start groping me. It was just sprinkle-sprinkle-dry-hump.

It was horrible, because it made me feel like some strange automaton. Like a sex dispenser. ""If you shower and use perfume, legs will spread"" - is that a way to approach a partner? There is a gargantuan gap between thinking about your partner and their needs and trying to meet them, and just going through the motions that may result in a bonk.

It's like the difference between your partner giving you bjs because she gets off on your pleasure and loves the way your brain melts under her tongue, and doing that because she read in Cosmo that's the fastest way to get you to propose."

soafraidofbees,OkCupid,1388936702.0,"When I was in college I dated a couple of different men who were 10+ years older than me. We had fun together and they were good guys, but I definitely felt a power differential between us. They had more money and more experience than me, so it seemed natural to always defer to them about what we should do as a couple, and they also often gave me advice about what to do in my personal life. I learned a lot from them, but I also think it's important for young people to develop their independence and confidence without always having a partner step in. 

The age gap also definitely made things weird with our friends/family. I think people judged them for being with a much younger woman, because many people will assume that the man is only in it for sexual reasons and is somehow a creep. My friends also didn't really get why I wanted to be with someone so much older, and they sometimes felt weird around my boyfriends. For that reason, being in age gap couples can sometimes feel isolating, like you don't have a group of ""our friends,"" so the time you spend together is always one-on-one and your partner doesn't integrate themselves into the rest of your life.

That said, I don't think any of this means you shouldn't date this guy. Just be aware of these possible issues and hold on to a strong sense of yourself, because that's what attracted him to you in the first place (hopefully). Good luck!"

A micro preemie born at, say 27 weeks, will have much greater trouble developing well outside the womb. Its respiratory and gastrointestinal systems are not prepared to function outside the womb. Chance of survival at all is something like 50% and there are likely to be growth and developmental deficits for several years, or for life.

Right, they want what you can't have, or they don't want it. If I close myself off, it makes them want me with all the fervor of Hitler. If I open up, they turn into a selfish psycho bitch and rip my heart out.

&gt;&gt;Because easy come, easy go, is what the sophomoric twits all say, and thus infect the collective mind of the masses: If someone easily gives their heart, it ""must"" be easy to lose, too. ""Nobody would do that"" they think, ""It must be a trick--he's not genuinely opening up to me, he's acting like it just to trick me.""

As an asshole, there's absolutely no chance they will ever get me to really fall in love with them. They won't earn it. It's not theirs to have. It's mine, because honestly, I like me better than them. Them? They're just vaginas to fuck. They are to be used and discarded when I'm finished with them. I wish it wasn't like that, but it's either this or they will be wasting their youth chasing another cock.

&gt;&gt;This is where the wages in my above analogies come in. the starting wage in the soulless dehumanizing office job is lower, but they ""promise"" you can earn more, until you never do. The starting wage in the disgusting job is abnormally high though, and would be a great starting wage, but what if it's the end of the line? What if that's as good as it gets? You can't live like that. You'd much rather be able to earn your way up. If you can.

This logic is all kinds of backwards. You will not earn your way up with an asshole. When I was nice, I was looking for someone who could be a potential future wife. I was willing to work together to build a future back then. Now I don't care what happens to them cause I know it doesn't matter."

There was a question on another thread that said, a year of torture and death or just death. I definitively say give me pain, it is still better than nothing at all.

I completely agree with the nihilistic precepts, I only think human life is defined by agency, therefore I am an absurdist, I do not care for/about the universe because it doesn't care for me. 

I am merely lucky to have the chance to take breath, in this particular moment, and I will enjoy it, because nothing can stop me from doing so, no man, no god not even the causality of destiny, maybe someday the stars will be against me but not now, because this moment is mine and nobody can take it from me.

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1388938063.0,"&gt; Why lie and tell her he's always had it, just to call her back over hours later to show her ""proof"" that he has no videos of her?

He wasn't proving that he had no videos of her. He called her over to show her the videos she had. He could have been busy with something and needed to wrap that up. Plus, he had to download weeks worth of footage off of four cameras. That can be a time consuming process. 

He could have lied to her originally because he was caught off guard and wasn't sure if he had enough proof yet to back up what he was saying. Especially if it's like, ""Hey, when did you get that teddy bear?"" ""Oh well you know I bought it a few weeks ago because the landlord is stalking me and there's a camera inside of it."" Most likely he was just not anticipating the need to tell this crazy story right there and then. 

If he's trying to compile as much evidence as possible he's going to want to wait as long as possible, especially since OP even said that she would have assumed he was cheating on her. 

Also, OP said earlier down that she saw the cameras weren't on when she looked. If he was using it to record sex they would have been on (since they had just had sex)."

Do no speak one more word to them or look in their direction so long as they insist on disrespecting your personal boundaries.  

&gt; *yet they are offended when we say we don't want children, as if it is a personal attack?*

I don't encounter this.  Just over the holidays there was someone who had asked me if I wanted children of my own at a family gathering.  I said that it was a personal topic that I didn't wish to discuss, and they dropped the subject. I didn't want to tell them about my personal choices, so I didn't.

shalashaskatoka,funny,1388938381.0,"I use to be BioChem( Similar path) a few years ago, but I switched to an IT field. I'm willing to guess that one issue is time investment.When you start school, you want to be a doctor or a lab tech or something. However as you go through the courses/talk to people in industry/look at jobs, you realize that at base, you can wipe your ass with your undergrad degree. You need to go get a masters/ go to med school for years in order to get something out of your undergrad degree. Now Im not saying its *Impossible*, but its a longer road than many are willing to walk.  
  
Many schools( at least mine did) tell freshmen that majoring in these science fields is a great decision for x and y reasons, but never get to the realties of that path such as the following: You are going to be in school for at least 2-3 years longer than your friends, medschool/masters is expensive and very necessary for the flashy jobs,competition is very high, classes are demanding 1 or 2 bad classes can ruin your medschool/ masters plans, for some reason the internships are unpaid in many cases, doctors and researches get paid well because they are typically up to their ass in debt from school, the cost of books is insane.The list goes on.

actuallyyours,AskWomen,1388938442.0,"You remind me of a younger me. I never dated when I was in school, not even a fling or a date. I used to think it's my height - I'm 177cm tall and Chinese; who would like someone like me? But no, it's because I never provided chances for guys to come ask me out.

After my career was on track, I created profiles on a few dating websites when I was around 23 or 24 years old and finally started dating - usually only for first dates and nothing serious was established. Some may think that it's a waste of time to go on one first date after another, but now that I look back, I realise that it's a good thing to start late. I was able to think logically and maturely; I was able to be independent and pay for dates; I was able to learn so much about relationships and myself in the process. I learnt what not to do, to say, and most importantly, what works for me and what doesn't. 

I am now 25 and happily in a relationship with the man I know I will marry one day, because he is exactly what I am looking for. And I know what I want only because of all the experiments I did when I was mature enough to understand relationships. So don't feel down! It's all about making the opportunities and gaining experience from it. The chances of you ending up alone is very rare, despite what others or what the society makes you think. Be confident and open, and you will run into the right people. :)

raika11182,doctorwho,1388938782.0,"My only complaint, and its a minor one at best, is that Moffat seems to come from the serial-drama school of writing. Now, I won't deny he's done a damn good job with the show. RTD had a certain campy flair to his episodes, in a way that really harkened back to the original series. Funny thing is, I think new fans may actually be more comfortable with Moffat's writing because his style is so familiar to them. Intrigue, conspiracy, mystery. In many ways Moffat writes *Lost* or *Heroes*, just with a mad man in a box as the show's hook.

For the die hard Moffat fans, this isn't a complaint. I really enjoy his style and I think the show is more engaging now than ever before. But sometimes, just sometimes, I miss having a zany adventure that's almost completely unrelated to the one before it."

Similarly,  I have made comments about the problems with young children who gain fame for singing in an operatic style. 

In all cases, every single one, I was accused of either jealousy or the inability to do what the singers in question do.  Nevermind that I know a whole hell of a lot more about the subject than the commenting fans, and have performed the selections in question in context in an actual professional production with orchestra for pay.

When redpillers go about being so forward many girls start to think that if a guy isn't being overly forward that they aren't interested or aren't manly enough when that isn't the case.

People talk about the best thing to do for yourself as though it's the best thing to do. People say ""smart"" to talk about career moves that screw over other people, or other things that, if you were really smart, you might think about, and realize were morally unacceptable by norms in morality.

It's smart to run away from a problem, and not help the people involved in it, only insofar as it is good *for you*. But if you actually consider ethics, you might realize a moral obligation to help, and, in such a case, the *actual* smart person does help, despite what's good for him.

SibcyRoad,GirlGamers,1388939690.0,"I remember back in the day when these reactions you mentioned actually bothered me. I would become instantly defensive and try my best to prove my nerd-worth. 

Then I grew up. A lot. I spent some time away from gaming and focused on my career for a while. I think once I was thrusted into a more mature and PC environment at work, I was able to realize how primitive and immature the gaming community tends to be.  Specifically surrounding the mindset of gender. 

I met men. Men who weren't treating me like dirt. Men who were feminists and wanted equality as much as I do. I met women. Women who were strong, opinionated and didn't care what anyone thought of them. Reflected in them I could see the real world opinion of me, and it was much more appropriate. 

And suddenly I thought less of those gaming ""boys."" It isn't a hatred anymore. It's a complete and total disregard for their existence on this earth. Their roles are to take up space and waste good air. And because of that, as soon as they speak anything remotely disrespectful, it falls on deaf ears. It's overlooked. Trivialized and dismissed. Like being lectured by a 3 year old. 

And as a bonus, I found that my lack of interest in their insults, and my continuation to do...well...whatever the hell I want regardless of their disproval, pissed them off something fierce. And the more they came at me, the more I didn't care. Because each sexist comment was another piece of evidence supporting my theory that they are useless human beings. And when something is deemed useless, their comments don't hold any weight. Instead of my instant reaction being anger, it was now pity. ""Oh they're just calling me a fat whore because they are useless pieces of trash."" Boom. They are now powerless.

You could try couples counseling. But I would try to just talk to him and get him to admit he's a husband and father now and he cannot play this off as innocent behavior or him being naive. He's a grown man and should know better. 

Also, as my therapist friend says, problems are rarely only about the problem at hand. Usually they are about bigger things. In this case, your husband's behavior could be related a larger problem about him not being a good husband or father, or him not caring about your viewpoint on issues, or him not showing you enough attention/other women and friends too much attention.

I never said the way he handled it was okay, but if it truly is because he froze up and just didn't know what to do that can be worked on. Even if he has to go to therapy to learn how to do with those situations (and be more open about sex since that's a problem), it's workable. 

I'm not saying what he did was okay, and I never said that. However, him doing it just to be impressive and disregard his feelings is different than actually be socially anxious/awkward/unaware, and they need to be approached in much different manners. 

I also said *if it was a pattern* (as in something that he's not working on/trying to fix and just letting it get the best of him) then yeah that becomes so much worse. If they talk about this and discuss the way he should have handled it appropriately, and he effectively handles situations like this in the future, then this situation is a lesson learned. Not a happy memory, but much better than a dick boyfriend who doesn't respect his girlfriend. 

Some people just don't have the knowledge to deal with situations like this. For some people it needs to be laid out, because in the heat of the moment they get freaked out and just don't know what to do. 

Do you think this wasn't an embarrassing situation for him either? If he's so uncomfortable about sex he doesn't want to discuss it with anyone, what makes you think he just wants to willingly discuss it with a bunch of dicks?

He might not have said anything to OP because he was embarrassed about the situation and was hoping they would have *some* maturity to not bring it up. Who knows? You can't apply what *you* would do to how he truly should have handled it if he was socially awkward. 

If he can learn from this and make sure this doesn't happen again then I really don't think it's the end of the world. Is it a sucky situation. Yes. Does it suck he didn't know how to deal with it properly beforehand? Yes. Should it ever happen again? Nope, definitely not. 

However, we're human. We make mistakes. If he takes the proper actions to ensure he doesn't do this again (even if it means avoiding those situations outright for the time being) then I definitely don't think that's as bad as a boyfriend who's just like, ""My girlfriend's a prude hahaha!!!"" "

slangwitch,relationships,1388940555.0,"There is maybe 10% of the female population your age who would ever ever ever agree to your terms as head of the household. I am all for hearing and respecting a partner's views to the point where their better ideas win out (I do not have some compulsion to always be right, in other words) but I will never accept being in a position where the gender of my partner becomes an everlasting override to my own opinions and decisions as a competent and intelligent adult. There will always be a situation where a person is wrong and having a dynamic where you can just tell her 'what is what' is ridiculous and insulting to her as a competent adult. 

Did you discuss this traditionalist view before marriage or just spring it on her during critical decisions on which you two disagreed? This should never be something that a person finds out later after making that commitment, especially considering how much of a deal breaker it is.

There is nothing more painful and infuriating to an adult than to be put in a position where their autonomy and choices are overridden like this. Consider how you would feel if a partner dictated this to you and placed you in your wife's current position? Would you stand for that treatment as an intelligent and independent human being with your own views and interests to express? 

Honestly, it sounds like you may have done some kind of insane personality change during your marriage that has freaked her out and made her feel she doesn't even know you at all. Her views on parenthood may have just been an attempt at distancing herself from you without heading towards single parenthood once she found that the man she had married was actually a domineering partner who she didn't even recognize. By focusing on the kid, she had an excuse to avoid you to some degree. Calling her bluff on that likely has led to her reevaluating her entire future with you as she sees that she cannot just hide behind motherhood as a way to avoid the huge issues between you two.

I have seen this happen in relationships and it never goes well. She is not your property for you to decide who in the relationship is the final decision maker or leader of the house. You need to set expectations for compromise and discussions of issues prior to marriage and then stick with them after marriage. Marriage shouldn't change the dynamics of your relationship beyond how you do your taxes and maybe deal with financial issues. And those issues should involve the same kind of compromises and open discussions as you have elsewhere, anyway. 

I really would like to know when you divulged your interest in being head of the household to her and what kind of situations have arisen since then wherein you have made that an aspect of disagreement resolution or the choices made for the entire household. Please go into further detail. 


Maybe you can find a way to express this to women early on in future relationships so that you find one amenable to this odd relationship dynamic. I would not put up with it personally. There will always be times where a partner is just plain wrong or small minded about something. Giving anyone  unilateral power to go with their sole decision making for multiple people is just asking for poor and infuriating choices to be made that drive group cohesion out the door. "

incogito_ergo,bodyweightfitness,1388940568.0,"Sorry to hear it. I agree with above poster, you can bulk with 10-15 minutes with weights. Don't skip warmup, but keep it short and take a break after if you need. You should be able to warm up in 2 minutes just by focusing on rotational movements (tons of good brief warm up vids on YouTube demonstrating). The most important warm up will be the lower weight version of the movement you'll be doing to failure. 

Have you tried weights? You may be able to manage a longer workout. Most power lifting training uses 5 minutes or more in between sets, so in an hour workout you are doing maybe 10 minutes of actual effort. In your position I would pick big compound movements and focus on 2 a day to failure (e. g. Bench and squat one day, deadlift and press the other, and just alternate between the two, maybe 3 days per week). If you work to failure, you can get good results with a single working set. If you can manage two sets, you're doing great. 

The bigger problem for you will probably be eating enough calories. IDK that I can help there given your post above.  FWIW I did a test for food sensitivities called the MRT (insurance didn't cover it, was around $400--best money I have ever spent), and went from being in constant pain and having to schedule everything around my health issues to being 90% symptom free other than when my allergies flare up, and even then it's a million times better. There is absolutely no way I would have been able to identify all the foods and chemicals I am allergic/sensitive to via an elimination diet (I had tried several times, but it seems like there are more things I can't eat than things that I can). IDK if that is feasible for you, but it changed my life. I also convinced a coworker with crippling IBS, as well as psoriasis and a variety of other fun autoimmune issues to try it, and within a year or so she was also almost completely symptom free. 

Not trying to get your hopes up, but I would at least see what it would take to give it a try. I feel like I lucked out, because I wound up with an allergist who was an expert in food allergies and sensitivities. No other allergist I've seen has even mentioned this test as a possibility.

RichardBehiel,worldnews,1388940883.0,"Cryogenic propellants are ""gases"" which are kept liquid by keeping them cold.  For combustion, you need a fuel and an oxidizer, such as liquid hydrogen (fuel) + liquid oxygen (oxidizer).  This combination is sometimes called ""hydrolox"" for short.  Similarly, liquid methane and liquid oxygen would be called methalox.  

Some liquid fuels are stable at room temperature, most notably RP-1 kerosene.  This is the fuel that a SpaceX Merlin engine runs on, with liquid oxygen (or LOX) as an oxidizer.  RP-1 has the advantage of not needing to be kept at a very low temperature, which makes it easier to store and work with, though it does have some drawbacks.  More information on the kerolox vs. methalox debate (with an emphasis on reusable booster stages) can be found [here](http://thehuwaldtfamily.org/jtrl/research/Propulsion/Rocket%20Propulsion/Propellants/DLR,%20Comparative%20Study%20of%20Kerosene%20and%20Methane%20Engines.pdf).

That was over 10 years ago and he was the returning star, thats why. Just like Rock came back to huge pops in the beginning and then eventually they died down to pretty regular pops, until WM 29 where the fans didn't seem to give much of a fuck during the main event.

&gt;You've been in neckbeard land too long. The general public still loves Hogan. No one believes or gives a shit about all the ""Hogan screwing guys over"" bullshit stories.

Calm down, mate, you're getting a little emotional here. Honestly though, i doubt Hogan's pop would be great at all. I hate to burst your bubble, but 'neckbeard land' and the real world aren't different places, ever noticed how Raw crowds generally prefer stereotypical IWC favourites?"

Not many people don't know, but even those who don't read fantasy - or read at all - tend to know who Martin is, with no clue on Gaiman. Unless we're counting Rowling as proper fantasy. In which case, she takes that crown.

I digress, the point is, if you don't have an interest in fantasy (and, like many people, avoid the genre) you might not know who Gaiman is from name alone.

papermageling,MakeupAddiction,1388941352.0,"Okay, so you'll need to tell us what country you live in if you want product recommendations. 

[Lisa Eldridge](http://lisaeldridge.com/video/) tutorials are fantastic, and I also like [Goss Makeup artist](http://www.youtube.com/user/gossmakeupartist/videos).

Okay, so in that picture, it looks like you're wearing foundation, eyeliner, and mascara. You probably also had on some concealer, and maybe eyeshadow, blush, and lip stuff. I'd recommend starting out with foundation, concealer, eyeliner, mascara, and blush. It'll let you emphasize your eyes nicely. 

So, to start with, let's talk foundation. What will work for you will depend on how dry or oily your skin is, and what sort of shade (which is not so easy to tell from photos). Revlon Colorstay is a rather nice drugstore foundation, but it doesn't have the right shade for everyone. If that doesn't work for you, but the shade range isn't too off, try Neutrogena Healthy skin. Buy those from places that allow returns for any reason (CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens, and Ulta do). If you're too pale, then you're stuck buying high end or Indie. For high end, go into a store that sells high end makeup, and you can test the product and get samples. For indie, I recommend [Meow Cosmetics](http://www.meowcosmetics.com/). You can order samples from them. You need a mineral primer underneath it to help it stick though. I use Physicians Formula mineral wear primer, but my CeraVe sunscreen works even better. To see if the foundation is the right color, see how well it matches your jawline. For a lot of people, you want to make your face that color, so it blends into your neck well. Foundation is lovely because it can make your skin look perfect :)

Next, onto concealer. Okay so the best spot concealer I've found is Glamoflauge by Hard Candy, found at Walmart, or on ebay if you haven't access to Walmart. For undereye concealer, I'm really liking Rimmel Match Perfection Concealer. 

So, onto eyes. Mascara is *magical*. Seriously. Finding one that works for you is always an adventure, but I've had good luck with Boots No7 Exceptional Definition (found at Target in the US, Boots in the UK). If possible, buy from a store with a good return policy, so that you're not stuck with 10 tubes of rubbish mascara. Maybelline Full and Soft Washable is also extremely well loved. 

Eyeliner is also wonderful. I like the cream eyeliners in a little pot that you use a brush for, but a stick version is probably easier to use. Those are easy enough to find. Physicians Formula has [some](http://www.physiciansformula.com/en-us/productdetail/eyes/pencils-liners/07873.html), Prestige has a great [one](http://www.prestigecosmetics.com/eyes/eyeliner/waterproofautomaticeyeliner.html). Look for this sort of thing though, where it's similar to a pencil but not quite. 

It looks from the picture like you've got hooded eyes, so eyeshadow won't show up that well for you. Get one matte brown one for contouring the eye area (I use an NYX one, obtained at Ulta). If you want to play with eyeshadow, look at Wet and Wild. They've got good quality for very low prices. If you're in the UK, I've heard good things about Sleek. You'll need an eyeshadow primer in this case: NYX HD primer is *fantastic*, better than UDPP. 

For blush, choose a color that you like. I like Boots No7 in Soft Damson, but because blush shouldn't be super pigmented, it's easy enough to find something good. 

If you'd like to try something on the lips, I'd recommend Revlon Just Bitten Balm Stains. A lot of lip products are too high maintenance, but these are wonderfully easy to use. 

Edit: Also, your job is sounds rather awesome ""What do you do all day?"" ""Play with fire :D"". But it probably isn't the sort of place where wearing makeup would work so well. It has trouble with high heat, usually. "

exposure_therapy,CrohnsDisease,1388941355.0,"I'm sorry that you aren't feeling better  =(

My GI told me that in his experience, patients that eventually respond well to a biologic tend to notice *some* improvement within a week or two, but that it typically takes 2 months to experience the full effect.  He also said that when patients experience a partial response by 2 months, but not full remission, he tries bumping them them up to weekly injections and/or adding Imuran, if the patients aren't on Imuran already.

So far, that seems to be the case for me.  I stopped bleeding three days after my first loading dose, and I noticed that I was experiencing less urgency after about a week.  However, I've experienced so much variability in pain and frequency/form from one day to the next, I don't think I would have noticed right away that I was getting better if I *hadn't* been keeping track of my symptoms.  For the first three weeks, I kept telling myself ""this is probably just a coincidence that I feel ok today,"" but now I can look back at my graphs, and see a clear improvement each week.  I don't consider myself to be completely in remission, but the difference between how I feel right now, and how I felt 5 weeks ago is drastic.  I'm still within the initial 2-month window, so I hope that I'll continue to improve (if not, I guess I might be a prime candidate for weekly injections).

tl;dr If you aren't doing so already, I highly recommend tracking your symptoms, because it makes it much easier to notice small improvements!  "

As long as you aren't hearing this in normal gaming situations (60-144FPS), I wouldn't worry too much. I've heard varying amounts of this on every card I've owned. You can play the RMA game if you want, but there's no guarantee you'll get a card back that is completely free of this noise.

As for the notion that this is *always* a PSU problem? It isn't. I opted for a CWT PSU over a Seasonic back in the day b/c the TX750 did not squeal at all with my GTX260, compared to my HX620 (which was like a banshee). Fast forward to a 680 or 780, I heard squealing on both PSUs *and* my newer SS-660XP, so I knew with my previous history that the squealing was now GPU-related.

mr_fishy,outhere,1388941698.0,"As far as the kids thing goes, it's not impossible. I don't know how adoption laws work in the UK but that seems like a pretty viable option. Of course if you wanted your own biological child and had some money you could use a donor egg and surrogate mom. So you should tell your mom that grandkids aren't completely out of the picture.

On the other hand, you still have the issue that same sex relationships ""make her feel ill."" Honestly, this is kind of silly, but a lot of straight people have the homophobic tendency to be a little squeamish about gay couples. Hopefully, though, she'll get over it with time, especially if she realizes that there really isn't a reason to be squeamish and if she sees you being happy in a relationship.

A support group would probably be a good idea for your parents, or at least your mom. Again, I don't live in the UK so I don't know any specifics, but you should try searching on the internet for an LGBTQ organization in your area. They can likely help you out with finding resources for your parents, possibly a support group, or even just talking to them - they're probably more practiced at it than you are and they might be able to give your parents some perspective. Plus, it always helps to hear it from multiple people.

Other than that, just keep doing what you've been doing. Answer their questions and show them you love them. Your parents seem like they're just worried about you, but once they get used to the fact that you're gay they probably won't worry as much about it.

I hope that helps, and good luck!"

I've always sensed this without actually understanding it: how is it that the average woman has many more choices than average guy when it comes to picking a partner?

a4bh3,relationships,1388942073.0,"This is a weird story from start to finish. Let's say it's true...not telling your fiancé about this and going over to the ""crazy landlord's"" apartment once in a while so as not to upset her is pretty dumb. He did not handle this well. If he's so willing to go out of his way to record his landlord's ""stalking,"" why not go get a lawyer or police first, or at least let people like OP know what's up? It's just bizarre to devote that much technology to ""protecting"" yourself when there are simpler ways to go about this.

He's getting a lawyer, which makes me think the story is plausible, but it'll be really tough to prove in court that he was being stalked or harassed when he was WILLING going over to her apartment and letting her in to his apartment (although there is a power dynamic here that could make him feel he had to). Also, because he never told anyone about this, there is no record corroborating his story about the landlord. All he has are some videos which probably can't definitively tell the whole story. They are certainly open to interpretation.

To be honest, OP's fiancé getting a lawyer could be a rouse. It's possible he was sleeping with his landlord and filming it either with or without her permission. The videos he showed OP corroborate his story to an extent, but he had ample time to remove ones he didn't want OP to see. But his story is pretty detailed and does explain a lot. It's tough to make up a story like that in a couple of hours, unless he already had a fabricated story ready to go."

mr_fishy,Libraries,1388942295.0,"Thanks for such a well-written response. Honestly, I don't go to the library as much as I used to, but when I was a kid it was one of my favorite places to go. I've always been a huge reader, and I didn't have money for a tablet or ereader (or even new books, really) so the library helped me get access to all sorts of books. It definitely improved my quality of life - most of the things I know I know from reading, and it gave me a good head start in school that I otherwise wouldn't have had.

Plus, there is an important social component to libraries. Like you said, they are community spaces. I would often go to the library to hang out with friends after school. They often have workshops where you can learn new skills, or book clubs where you can meet people with common interests. It's a lot harder to get that sort of thing for free on the internet - people who live near you that can give you that sort of experience. Not to say that forums and chat rooms can't do similar things, but I don't think that interaction online will ever fully replace interaction in the real world.

Also, the library policy changes made after 9/11 just proves how awesome libraries are, at least imho."

Mutta ympärileikatut miehet ympäri maailmaa kuitenkin harrastavat seksiä ihan mielellään. Naisten ympärileikkauksia tehdään siksi että seksi olisi naisille kivuliasta ja epämielyttävää. Siksi kehtaankin väittää, että vaikka miehiä ympärileikataan enemmän, tekee naisten ympärileikkaus enemmän tuhoa naisen vartalolle. Tätä voisi verrata vaikka siihen, että miehiltä leikataan pois yksi sormi ja naisilta koko käsi.

Colres,AskReddit,1388942424.0,"I'm not sure what there is to be confused about. If bisexuality means you care for and are sexually attracted to both men and women non discriminatorily, then pansexuality means your attractions do not discriminate against any identification.

In my experience it's not a matter of taste or orientation. I may be completely crazy but in my delusion we have a conscious mind and a subconscious mind. Our decisions are made based on our past experiences, and so every possible choice is already made, based on the current state of our brain. Our conscious mind is the one that feels the need to have labels, call ourselves heterosexual or homosexual or yellow or green. But really our decision to be attracted to someone happens in our subconscious mind. Who knows who I'll be attracted to tomorrow or the next day, all I know (and all anyone can know) is what they've tended towards in the past.

And so people give themselves ever more specific titles because they think that the most important thing is to know what they are. In an ideal world at least by my theory we'd walk down the street, be attracted to someone, go up to them and if they are attracted in return that would be about it. Some people would still be mostly attracted to one gender or the other, but  nobody would care, just ""I'm attracted to this person right now"".

The high schools around here all had teams, but they were always full of travel players. My school in particular was pretty big and the team had quite a really good AAA players and a couple of guys who were going to play in the OHL. Because of this I always though I wasn't good enough to play and never bothered to try out.

Anyway, senior year I finally grew some balls and tried out. Ended up making the team. There were two seasons, fall and spring. Fall was first obviously, and I finished the season as the leading scorer in the entire league. Spring season I was given an A, and was again one of the leading scorers.

Now I wasn't nearly as talented as the guys who were going to the OHL or the AAA guys, but I was proud of how I was able to hold my own. Playing with them definitely inflated my stats a bit but I kept up with many of them. This team made me realize I probably could have made AAA if I had tried out, and I kind of regretted never going for this, but whatever.

baha24,DenverBroncos,1388942675.0,"Sigh, I can't believe I'm about to defend KC.

When the Chiefs played those ""weak teams"" this season (as one commenter put it) they were going up against reserve players, especially at the QB position. But here's the main point: we had almost *the exact same schedule* as them. We played the AFC South and the NFC East, too. Except for the games we played due to last year's seed positioning - we played Baltimore (they played Cleveland) and New England (they played Buffalo) - the only difference between our schedules was where we played the opposing team. And heck, the Cleveland Browns, whom KC played, almost beat New England!

The same commenter said ""at least they could have beaten the Chargers."" Well, first of all, they almost did, *with their mostly reserve team*, which would have knocked SD out of the playoffs. And in case anyone missed it, the Chargers beat us this season *at home*.

Sure, KC wasn't a high-power scoring team for most of the season - and yes, the games in which they were came at the hands of two teams with the worst seasons, Washington and Oakland - but their defense was stout. They held us to one of our lowest scoring games (27-17) of the season. They have a young QB, who only gets better with every game, a brand new coach, who has obviously worked wonders with that team, and one of the top RBs in the league. I think they'll be a force to be reckoned with in the seasons to come.

I hate arguing with fellow Denver fans, but we have to be fair. I'm sure teams were saying the same thing about us in 2011 when we won the AFC West with an 8-8 record but held the tiebreaker against KC and SD. Sure, KC may have been slightly overrated this season, which is why they were knocked out in the Wild Card round, but the fact is they made it to the playoffs. And I'd be a little worried with the seasons they will produce in the years to come.

If you don't want to take medication, there are definitely more (and sometimes better) options, like CBT or EMDR just to name a few. If you are sure you don't want medication, I recommend you to go to a (licenced to give diagnoses) psychologist instead of psychiatrist, because a psychiatrist is there mostly to give you and assist you with taking medication.

A good interview consist at least of one or more interviews, combined with a structural clinical interview (you'll checking symptom lists together) and/or selfreport checklist(s) and/or tests (last will probably not apply to you as I've not seen any indication there is a problem with your intelligence or concentration).

You can tell them before hand about that you are worried because you have been given different diagnoses by different people, as it also may help them to realise that you might have a bit more complicated problem to solve.

It's a matter of *how much* faster than light hyperspace is. Hyperspace is thousands to *millions* of times the speed of light. I wasn't exaggerating when I said they could hop across the entire galaxy in a few days.

As for the Grey Knights: there are roughly 1,000 of them at a time. How, precisely, are they going to defend the entirety of Imperium space? And how can they even get close enough to engage the Imperial Fleet? I mean, the Eclipse-class Super Star Destroyers would be picking off battle barges and Imperial cruisers left and right from extreme range with its superlaser. A single *Imperial*-class Star Destroyer can glass an entire planet's surface from orbit; wiping out an entrenched Space Marine position would be easy.

Supplies are a different problem, but I don't think it'd be worse for the Empire than for the Imperium. A single farm world could likely supply a fair-sized Imperial fleet, given that they supply hive worlds with population densities similar to your average Imperial Navy ship.

seanomenon,alcoholism,1388942992.0,"Fair enough, and glad to see you back. We get a lot of people posting in the middle of the night who never return or delete their post the next day.  

I was pretty lucid as a drinker most of the time too. I personally think an extremely high tolerance (aka ""holding your liquor"") isn't the greatest thing for alcoholics, its a sort of self-enabling.

Anyway, back to your actual questions. I'm guessing you've tried to moderate your drinking and can't consistently drink sanely. Many alcoholics have found the only reliable long-term solution to the problem is complete abstinence from alcohol. It is true for me, and I tried everything I could think of in order to drink moderately. Abstinence requires a serious commitment, and a major lifestyle change. 

Religious folks will talk about faith and a higher power and an external supernatural power helping you. Sometimes I think it would be nice to believe in a god, because it would be helpful to think that god wanted me sober. But I have never believed, and part of getting sober for me was a rigorous honesty about that lack of faith. Yes, I'm the guy who sobered up and found no god. 

Here's the funny part - I highly recommend AA meetings, regardless of faith. Nonbelievers like us need to adapt the support that's available and use the helpful parts of it. And the vast majority of AA meetings I've been to have been primarily focused on sobriety. The reason is that the meetings provide support, camaraderie, and examples of people living happy, healthy, sober lives. Alcohol is our culture's drug of choice, and to give it up is to put yourself at odds to our society in a very real way. Knowing other people who have been through it and adjusted is a real help. 

There are agnostic AA meetings, maybe there is one near you.

I also find meetings in non-religious venues (in other words, not church basements) tend to be less religious. 

I have also found gay-friendly AA meetings to be less religious. 

There's a lot of options out there. 

I highly recommend you [try a few AA meetings near you.](http://www.aa.org/lang/en/subpage.cfm?page=28) They have different ""personalities"", so try a few. Go before you've had anything to drink that day. It can feel scary and imposing, but you will be welcomed. 

I'm happy to share my experience, or try to answer any questions you have. Feel free to keep the conversation going here, or via PM if you'd prefer.

Good luck."

1. I didn't use the sausage because there was none in the house. I bet it would've made a tasty addition though. 
2. Instead of putting it in the oven to cook the eggs I just covered the pan on the stove until they were cooked. 
3. I don't like runny eggs so I cooked them longer so they'd be more firm. 
4. Also along with the suggested spices I added a little chili powder to give it more flavor.

Dialects are not always regional they can be differentiated by social class and ethnicity as well (we specify by using the terms sociolect or ethnolect as opposed to topo- or regiolect which refers to the traditional understanding of dialect). Again you're conflating writing with speech. He uses a style (or writing variation) approximating African-American culture. 

Also, intellectual beginnings? Do you really think that dialects have to have ""intellectual beginnings""? I guess you are an uncouth speaker of English, not a noble speaker of the one, true, pure Indo-European tongue. Patterns of speech are not objectively stupid, only in your biased, subjective mind. There's a century of science to back me up. 

As for whether these kids are emulating the speech of a different group or not, why not? Are you afraid of the prestige of AAVE rising? I think it's nothing but a good thing for a variety of English often shat on by people who don't know a phoneme from a letter. "

Had Grant been white, with the same background and priors, would it have been as big a deal publicly? I don't think it would, which sucks. I think human life in general, no matter race, religion, or sexual preference, should be looked at equally. But in today's society (not just the justice system as you stated) everyone is looking for the reason.

Accidental shooting. Accident. *Yeah, but it wouldn't have happened if he was white, or a white woman*. No one knows that. Maybe, maybe not.


This guy won't make a cake for that dude's wedding. *It's cuz he's gay, isn't it?* Maybe he thinks he's classier than your wedding, maybe he's a bigot. We don't have to fight every situation as if every person is being intentionally victimized. Bigots are out there, aplenty, but just because I was born white doesn't mean I am one. And just because this cop *accidentally* shot a black guy doesn't mean he is one either. He sure as hell is a victim, but again, since he didn't die and *he's white*, he isn't viewed as one (as you have shown).

I'm not saying the cop shouldn't have been imprisoned, nor am I saying he's only a victim because he was imprisoned, but I am saying 100% he is a victim of the circumstances.

duffmanhb,politics,1388943408.0,"You're trying to tell me that they went to war in Iraq to justify the creation of the TSA? That's pretty far fetched.

From an international politics perspective, it's clear why we wanted war. Iraq was getting pushy with their neighbors and threatening to get off the USD as a means of selling oil. The US saw this as an international threat to both the global economy (foreign states no longer needing a USD reserve for oil would flood the economy with USD) and our sphere of influence (Iraq was actively trying to undermine our influence in the region which was setting bad precedence).

It makes sense that we would want to give them a public spanking to to let everyone know what happens when they undermine US influence. It also makes sense that people would make money off the war. Obviously there are industries that profit off war, and surely they have a degree of influence. 

But what I'm looking for is the conspiracy. I haven't seen it yet if one exists, only loosely based speculation. Saying that the US needed to bomb their own defense hub and financial centers to find an excuse to go to war is ridiculous. There are tons of simpler ways to drum public support that don't involve shooting our own foot. There are a countless number of ways to get public support for the war other than coordinating a huge conspiracy involving thousands of people.

I mean, Iraq was all about MWDs, and that reason alone would have gotten us into war at the time, they didn't need 9/11 but they certainly leveraged it. I think the only conspiracy can be in the lieing part. That's pretty evident. The question is who was coordinating the false information. Multiple intelligence sources from around the globe were only producing the false information while institutionally preventing the information that painted a different narrative from ever getting out. Multiple state heads had to have been involved. So the question is really, why? Why did they find such a need to go to war that they had to go through so much effort to only allow the leaders to receive false information? Why was the IC so interested in the war? At this level, it has to be more than just money. If money is what all it takes, then the defense industry would have launched us into war with the Russians right after the collapse. But on a state level, money tends to only get leached out. It's not easy to get a state into war just for money."

itsmevichet,WritingPrompts,1388943554.0,"""I am Death, and I am come for...""

Derek looks up from his list and blinks twice. Standing before him is Mila Kunis or whatever her name is. He has seen her face on the television sets of the old and feeble as he took them in the night, barely noticing a thing save for her face. In spite of the repetitive hell of his grim work, her warm, yet reserved expression had stuck with him.

He clears his throat. Mila raises an eyebrow.

""You 'am' come...?"" she asks sarcastically.

""Uh... yeah. I mean. Yeah, you dead, girl. I got my car out front. You gotta come with me."" He clears his throat again. ""I mean, my carriage awaits, my lady, for you have a date with destiny."" He pauses. ""Shit, I sound like a tool,"" he mutters under his breath.

""How do I know you're death and not some cracked out hobo in a robe?"" she asks defiantly as she cocks a gun that she was hiding somewhere while Derek was daydreaming about how nice her hair smells. Mountain fresh!

Not wanting to cause a scene, Derek quickly conjures up some dead celebrities she might know. A thin, pale figure with disheveled black hair, wearing dark clothes adorned with chains appears before them. He looks around and speaks in a chldish voice.

""Oh come on, Derek, I was in the middle of a game of Tekken with Rick James, I was about to finish him, man!"" Michael complains. ""Who's house we in?""

Mila's jaw drops. ""Oh. My. God. I never realized how much I loved. your music until you died!""

Michael starts to get all sensitive. A ghostly tear appears in his eye. ""Oh, hey Mila, thank you so much. I always did it for the fans, even if they didn't all love me at the same... wait a minute,"" Michael says, looking at Derek. ""Why we in Mila Kunis' house? Oh no you don't Derek, don't put this evil on her, she's too youn...""

""Okay Mike,"" Derek says, ""time to go!"" He waves his hand and as Michael Jackson's ghost fades away.

""I'm not forgetting about this bullshit Derek, we gonna have words at our next house meeting, man, you cost me a game of Tekken!"" Michael's voice wails from the beyond.

Mila crosses her arms and gives him a look that recalls hundreds of photos and TV appearances he could only been aware of subconsciously. ""So I'm dead. Is this because of that deal with the Devil I made to learn English and become famous?""

""Shit, why does Stan have to be involved? That smooth talking asshole gets ALL the souls,"" he thinks to himself. Then he makes eye contact, even though she can't see his glassy gray eyes under his grim shroud. His mother always like his eyes. Derek took her in the early morning after she had her last cup of tea at the hospice. It was a bittersweet moment. She could recognize his voice anywhere, and when she realized it was him, she pulled back his hood to see his eyes to be sure. ""Marrying eyes,"" she called them, teasingly.

Derek casually pulls back his hood, and smiles weakly in an attempt to dispel the growing awkwardness. ""Yeah, I dunno about any deal you made, but you're on my manifest. Most people who deal with Stan end up there,"" he says sympathetically.

Mila just sighs. ""Okay. I guess I don't need to bring anything, huh?""

Derek sucks in air through his teeth like he'd just eaten a habanero. ""Yeah,"" he starts. ""You can't bring anything with you, but you have to get a job in the afterlife to get a nice place in the Astral plane. Thing is, you'll be working for Devil Inc as a low level analyst if you made a deal with Stan, so, you'll probably be in his corporate housing, which is just barely affordable with your salary. You might be there a while.""

Mila is taken by a resigned countenance, and shrugs as she looks at the floor.

""I mean, Mike seems to like you though, and we have a spare room in our house, so you could stay there for a while as you workoff your debt,"" he says, beginning to trail off into the uncertainty of his offer even being considered.

Mila laughs. ""So, let me get this straight, Death is roommates with Michael Jackson, and he's offering for me to live with them in the afterlife so I don't get screwed by a shitty job I agreed to 10 years ago?""

Derek smiles nervously. ""Technically it'd be 'unliving' with us."" He mentally kicks himself.

She looks into his eyes as she lets out another laugh. ""Well, you seem like a nice enough guy. Why not?""

He hides his enthusiasm as best he can for fear of accidentally killing other people on the block, and instead extends his hand. ""Let's go,"" he says, as she offers her own in return. He'd never felt more confident in his unlife.

Its very disrepectful not to mention that it is very cliche to say that, but that is your problem not mine.

Im absolutly for the separation of power in a society. And therefore we need the executive branch to executes or enforces the law.

carpetano,soccer,1388943606.0,"Only Gil and some of his henchmen knows the exact amount of pending debt. There are a lot of contradictory reports but most of the numbers are secret and the reports are just estimations based on unofficial sources and the little public information. The Hacienda part should be around 90M€ right now if we trust the last ""official numbers"" that Spain released in 2012 when Atlético owed 120 M€ to Hacienda because the payments have been 40M€ each season. Making the Math, the Hacienda debt should be 120-40+5% (yearly interest). Also, it has been said that after last 40M payments, the yearly fee is going to be reduced to 20M until it's cleared.

The rest of the debt include both long and short term payments, so it isn't like if the SAD was going to be bankrupt if they don't sell every player now. Also, we shouldn't forget that Atlético makes a lot of money, not even close to Real Madrid or Barcelona, but it's still a lot and if Gil don't go back to his well known bad practices the debt should be manageable. Atlético's economy is bad, but not worse that other clubs' economy, so they will probably sell some good player next Summer but they aren't in such a hurry to sell now.

I've even seen some reports where they were counting the debt twice, because despite the debt payments are already included in the corresponding part of the budget, the reports substracted them from the benefits."

Colres,AskReddit,1388943736.0,"&gt;I will agree that human beings fall somewhere on a spectrum of sexual attraction ranging from fully straight to fully gay. But you are where you are on that spectrum.

All of my no. Indulge me in taking a listen. Imagine a tray. This tray represents your opinion on anything. In this case, we are talking about sexual identity. The bottom of this tray is not flat. As a matter of fact, it's not even uniform. When completely empty, the tray represents your genetic opinion. The tray might lean one direction or another. But with every relevant experience (seeing someone on the street, sex, things like that) a drop of water is added to the tray. This can shift the balance of the tray. Sure, with some people the topography means that it will never tip in a different direction. But in my case, I can go months on dudes, then switch back and forth with girls for a while... It's not a balanced scale.

It's similar to opinions. Every new piece of information you gain on a topic adds weight in one direction or another. You can be the world's biggest fan of someone and then think they're terrible when they murder someone and eat their legs. I'm not saying sexuality is an opinion (I'd be beaten by both sides for that one) but depending on who you are, time and experience can definitely move you in like twelve dimensions on what you seem to think is a two dimensional spectrum."

Taken in moderation, it sounds a lot like liberalism. Taken to the extreme, it sounds like anarcho communism (no government, but most people equal). Might just me a misunderstanding on my part.

Also, how can you have modern society without absentee ownership of property? A major reason we've advanced with capitalism is while the rewards are vastly unequal, societal progress is a collaborative effort....factories and the like require more than one person to run. You need many, many people working toward common goals to really get stuff done. If everyone is an island unto themselves, and only reaps the rewards of what they work on directly, then how can such massive collaborative efforts happen? Public ownership of the means of production? That's literally socialism/communism.

I think they'd both be interested in your position.  I think Franklin may have hit a ceiling at Vanderbilt and Golden just got screwed by the NCAA at Miami.  I don't think either of these parties are trying to play a raise off of you.

I personally think Al Golden will be a better culture fit, though.  Vanderbilt had a need for something new and ""hip"" and I think that's why Franklin has worked so well there.  Read through [Franklin's twitter feed](https://twitter.com/jamesfranklinvu).  I don't think he screams ""Penn State""."

terp02andrew,hardware,1388943993.0,"1. Your ""600W"" RP600V2, ATNG OEM, is only rated to provide 35A (430W) combined from the 12v rail. [H]ardOCP reviewed a 500W unit from the same ""RP"" line and gave it a [fail](http://hardocp.com/article/2009/02/16/entry_level_power_supply_roundup/14) rating. So right off the bat, I would strongly recommend moving to a better PSU for the long-term. 

2. Are you based in the US? I'd recommend the 450W Rosewill Capstone at [$59](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/rosewill-power-supply-capstone450). 

3. The GTX770 takes about 180W at peak. Depending on your chip, at 4.5Ghz I'm guessing you're drawing 133-150W. So as long as you have a *quality* PSU that outputs 450W or better, you're still very much in the clear. Your current ATNG-based ""600W"" is only rated for 430W on the 12v rail, gives no indication at what temperature it was rated at (25C, who knows), and does not even carry a 80Plus cert. Meanwhile the Superflower-based Capstones are rated for at 50C and are 80Plus Gold certified :P It is also rated for 444W (37A) on the 12v rail."

rq60,web_design,1388944062.0,"&gt; That would have to be a pretty big dictionary to include mommah

Have you seen a password cracker's dictionary?  They are large... for a human.  But what is large for us is trivial for a computer.

&gt; plus dictionary attacks go after passwords with just 1 word in them, more then 1 word with a large dictionary become unwieldy (imagine a 10k word dictionary with 2 word passes, 100 million possibilities, 3 words, 10E12)

Tools for performing dictionary attacks usually try different composites with the words, appending characters to them, and usually already contain certain composites.  You'd probably find ""hunter2"" in a password cracking dictionary.  They do this because it is still a lot faster than a brute attack and it usually works.  

It works because uninformed authors (like this one) say doing things such as adding one more character on the end of an insecure password is a good practice.  Also, they often contain passwords from previously hacked databases and humans aren't very good at thinking differently.

Your password should have a lot of [entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_\(information_theory\)), that's what computers have a hard time dealing with.  yourmommah has very little entropy."

There's no absolute quantifiable scale of morality, and you're putting words in my mouth to boot. I'll go over it once more.

&gt;""You will take responsibility for the life you've created, because we are a civilized country.""

There is no life yet. If you consider an unborn baby life, then abortion is murder. Do you?

&gt;Your father refuses to acknowledge you exist. He just wanted your mother to be a fuck toy.""

""Your mother knew she would have to take care of you alone, but she preferred to fuck up the lives of both of you because she absolutely wanted to have a child then and there instead of waiting for a better opportunity."" If you give the woman the last word, you can't blame the man for her decisions.

In addition, how is it better to give that woman the false security of child support, when we all know that single-parent families give significantly worse results in childrearing? Perhaps forcing the women to take the opinion of the man into account would reduce the amount of deadbeats. I'm pro-choice, let's make fatherhood a positive choice too.

thingsgetwhatever,AskWomen,1388944326.0,"&gt; It is also just hard for me to be around someone who seems at the mercy of her ephemeral emotions, without being able to make a stab at controlling at least their reactions, maybe even being able to reflect and choose positive and productive ways to deal without needing the opinions and support of others the entire way.

I'm not saying her actions here are right, but I do just want to give the other side of this as someone who has a lot of problems self soothing emotions.  Most of the time by the point where I'm talking it out or venting, it's because I've tried so hard to just soothe ineffectively without any success that it's like my whole body is almost vibrating from feeling something so strongly.  The longer I sit trying to calm it, the more the feeling seems to amp up and it internally feels like if I don't talk it out that I might implode.

Now, I'm 100% aware that this is not great, but knowing it's not great doesn't magically provide me with self soothing skills that actually work.  The only way I've made any progress is with very intense therapy specific to these types of issues.  Even then it's slow progress.  It's just not as easy as ""choose a more productive way"" when I was starting not even knowing what a ""productive"" way might look like and then going through the process of adjusting to which productive ways would actually work for me.

I've been doing this self soothe type therapy for about a year now and while improvements have been made, sometimes that body vibration of intensity hits me so hard that it feels like my mind just can't grasp the productive stuff instead.

I think a lot of times when people are bad at self soothe it's because they never really learned what the productive methods are and have no idea where to start on finding them because the basic advice is just ""choose something better.""  It's also usually coupled with people who tend to feel emotions at a much more intense level, so then you're trying to choose things you don't know with feelings that feel totally uncontrollable.

Again, I'm not saying she's right.  It's just the process to improve on these types of tendencies is not always an easy road.  I also just guess I wanted to say that in many cases people like this are *painfully* aware in their minds that things aren't exactly right, but at a loss on what specifically to do about it.  We know it's an issue, we just don't know what the heck to do about it.  Or maybe she has no idea, hell if I know.

Emotional regulation is a skill like any other.  It has to be learned.  Saying ""just choose this skill"" is like telling someone who has never touched a computer to design an amazing website.  They'd feel lost and like it was an impossible task.  If they have books and resources and a teacher it's possible.  Without those the odds of success are pretty low, though maybe doable depending on a number of factors."

There are some wonderful religious people. To reason that maybe people weren't perfect two thousand years ago so maybe they wrote some slightly bigoted things down isn't that hard.

DropShop06,dayz,1388944425.0,"Big firefight with a group of bandits.

I was in the ACT in Balota waiting with my gun raised to reward any bambi's with a filled canteen, a can of beans, and a can opener. My gear was a jam packed ammo box with pristine attachments for my M4 and two 60/60 STANAG coupled. If anyone was looking for a fight, I sure as hell was gonna give them one.

I've got my sights trained on the stairwell when, all of a sudden, the first bambi comes along with his taloon backpack and little else. He freaked out a bit, but I was able to calm him (and myself) down and offered him the supplies previously listed. I had put them on the ground  and kept my gun raised just incase. As he was picking them up I heard gunshots from across the AF towards the barracks.

I tell the bambi to stop and come to me prone. He does as I say and I tell him to stay there as I go very slowly up to the top of the ACT. I scope in to see 4 guys in full gear with 2 other bambi's in handcuffs completely naked of any gear whatsoever. Then, more shots and the bambi's are down. I take a deep breath, go back down the stairs and tell the bambi that, on my mark, he will sprint as fast as he can to the forest from the ACT. 

Things go off without a hitch and the bambi got away no shots fired whatsoever (Godspeed friend). I prepare myself for what I promised my self what I would be in this game: a hero. I go prone on the staircase with my sight set on the door. I wait about 2-3 mins with nervous shuffling and a twitchy LMB finger. 

I see movement in the window to the right, then a body with full gear comes in the ACT. My first bandit falls. I do not reload as I still have 49 shot left in the clip. I wait and I move up the stairs and hold down q. Another bandit comes in and he falls just as quickly as the other one. My heart is pumping like a white boy's fist at a techno concert. 

I unscope and immediately notice movement coming down the stairs from the top floor of the building. I spray the rest of my clip and I was extremely fotrunate that it had killed the bandit. It occured to me that this one had to have wrapped around the building out of my sight and used the ladder to get the top floor. With this information in mind I made my sprint out of the building only to find that the fourth bandit was right behind the corner of the door and I had forgotten to reload. Shots fired and I'm down.

After that whole thing I just took a big breath, smiled to myself and took a good break. Damn this game is amazing.

tl;dr I got in a firefight with bandits, ensured the safety of a bambi, killed three of them before I died."

Within the current scientific paradigm there is no choice but to maintain that-- but so far all attempts to account for consciousness within a materialist framework have resulted in failure.  First there were the reductionists, but that program failed due to intentionality and qualia, then there were the eliminativists (like Dennett at one point) who essentially denied the existence of subjective conscious awareness.  Searle once dryly referred to this view as a form of intellectual pathology.  Now we have the emergentists, who are essentially saying ""we can't explain it, but we need it so we have no other recourse but to say 'poof' there it is"".  The point, though, is that no headway has been made on the hard problem from the current paradigm in over 150 years."

IntellegentIdiot,loseit,1388944624.0,"You don't really ask any questions so I assume you're not looking for advice or information, which shouldn't be surprising given your background.

You're right, you'll probably look far better if you're 175lbs of muscle than 165 of flab (or anything of flab). You're in a good place if you're looking to get back into shape since you not only have the knowledge but you're not concerned about being muscular either. I'm sure you know that it's easier to rebuild muscle you've lost than the build it the first time so with that in mind can I suggest a weight lifting program like starting strength (SS) or strong lifts. Doing squats might even help you with your knees

A gun will deter some violence but the violence it does not tends to includes death. It can also invite violence in some circumstances. While I think handling a gun is useful and it is useful to carry in some situations, I think it is also important that the consequences and possible effects of carrying a gun are understood. The ""I have a gun so no one will attack me."" attitude is naive. Having a weapon escalates and attracts violence. It tells the other person ""I'm willing and able to hurt/kill you.""

But we also know that there are brain scans that show that ADHD affects function in the frontal lobe, giving way to different behavior and scanning tendencies. Personally, I think seeing ADHD as a disorder is destructive, and inaccurate. The tendencies come from a predisposition to the behavior that is a problem because it doesn't match up with how our society wants it to.

funkb0mb,AskScienceFiction,1388944702.0,"Star Fleet draws on the naval traditions of the Royal Navy and the U.S. Navy.
An officer issuing orders to any other officer of junior rank may refer to them as ""Mister.""
Any officer in command of a ship, regardless of rank will be called ""Capitan."" by his/her subordinates and superiors. In ""Redemption,"" Data was given command of a ship in Picard's blockade fleet. He kept his actual rank, but was addressed as ""Capitan.""

Here are some Royal Navy customs that didn't make it into Star Trek but should have, I think:

""Commodore"" was a temporary rank given to a senior Captain given command of a squadron or battle line of ships; basically an acting admiral. The U.S. Navy adopted this title as a permanent rank for a kind of junior admiral. If Star Fleet did this, then in ""Redemption,"" when Picard is ordered to assemble a fleet to blockade the Romulans, he would have been called Commodore until the fleet was dissolved.

""Commander"" was also a half-way rank given to a junior captain commanding a anything bigger than a Brig but smaller than a Frigate. The USN adopted this as a permanent rank, and added the junior rank of ""Lieutenant Commander."" Had Star Fleet kept the RN tradition, then Riker would have been ""First Lieutenant"" or ""Premier."""

Went to an afterparty at the guy's apartment. After everyone left, we were spooning in his bed and my fingers started wandering, and so did his. He awkwardly asked if I wanted to ""do it"" (which is kind of adorable).

We got a condom and he tried to put it in but it didn't work. He got on his back and I noticed he wasn't hard. I started giving him a blowjob and actually enjoyed myself but I was so tired and he was so quiet that I just stopped. We did some more manual stimulation but neither came. Then we spooned more. He has a really nice dick.

I'm ok with the situation, I'm really into him and this is a development, so it's good :)

Or taking me for granted once I moved in. It wasn't a question of me suddenly losing interest in sex, it was losing interest in sex with him because he wouldn't wash or talk to me.

I have never ""rewarded"" anyone with sex, and I do not plan to. Neither have I withheld sex as ""punishment."" The thing is, just because I have a high sex drive does not mean I don't have *standards* where sex is concerned. Seeing it that way is the first step to treating me like a sex dispenser: ""you said you liked it, eh? So spread 'em!""

ArgyleMN,tall,1388944934.0,"First off, hi height twin and neighbor! Second, I would recommend finding one ""girly"" item and adding it to an outfit you usually wear. Whether it's a pair of cute heels that you wear with jeans or a fun skirt with keds and a sweatshirt, the fusion of girly and tomboy can look really playful on us tall women. Plus, it allows you to develop confidence in something girly. One tip I would give is the 2/3-1/3 rule. 2/3s of your outfit should be on 1/2 of your body, 1/3 on the other half. AKA, don't pair a short skirt with a tank top (unless you are going dancing or something where you want revealing clothing). Pair a tank with cute jeans or a short skirt with a cardigan. I find this helps make items that look small on a tall woman look intentionally small and not like we just can't find clothes that fit.

If you're looking for strength in numbers, know that I wear 4"" high heels when I go out, I prefer skirts and dresses to anything else, and I do my makeup every day (except during exam weeks, because seriously, who has time for that?). I am admittedly incredibly girly in my sense of fashion and have been since high school. I love playing up my legs when I choose an outfit. It takes some time and trying on a bunch of different outfits, but if you develop confidence and find pieces that play up your favorite features, you will look fabulous. And never underestimate the power of walking into a room and just owning it ;-)"

I'm sure you get it by now, but I thought of a funny (to me..) way of describing it. Bisexuality is like the logic OR gate, where someone needs to be either male or female to turn the output on (Heh, get it? It's funny because the output is turned on.) And pansexuality basically takes any human input, whether the input is male, female, transgender, dresses their one half as male and their other half as female and switching on alternate tuesdays..."

You may think you are ugly but know the most attractive thing about a women to me is her voice.
I have crooked teeth, something small you may think. All the same, I feel that it has kept me back, made me shy away from situations.
But it also made me value the people and relationships I have had because something more important that my appearance was at stake. I'm also really tall which many people desire and many people also called me a freak because of.
You think you are ugly, and many people may agree and think less of you, but many people may agree and not care. I'm only 32 but my advice to an 18 year-old in your situation is to not think about other people's second glance, the strangers who look at you and make you feel bad. 
1. Work to find people you can build relationships with and 2. make sure you treat these people the way you would want to be treated.
I know, still shit advice that you probably know but please take it to heart.
The one thing I can assure you is that things will get better. Maybe not at first but please trust me. Things change for all of us and they will for you; some you can change some you can't. What will define who you are is how you react to these things.

Most endometriosis is diagnosed by laparoscopic surgery, a very quick procedure to see if you have scarring built up outside the uterine walls. Or your gyno/family doctor can do a detailed history of all your symptoms and basically make an educated guess. 

For instance my periods are so debilitating that I will spend entire days puking my guts out in the bathroom while experiencing cramps that feel more like birth pains. Pain medication is mostly ineffective since I just yak it up and then can't keep anything else down.

We all got insecurities, and it's totally acceptable for you to have them. So ignore all the ""BUT YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL SHUT UP"" comments also. I mean, clearly you're attractive, otherwise I wouldn't be saying all this. But at the same time, don't look down at yourself because of that.

One night he comes into the living room and starts shouting at me for making noise. This is absurd because I was quietly reading a book. Turns out he was hearing things. Anyway he starts hitting me so while still in the chair I lift my leg up and kick him in the chest. Then I punched him hard in the face and stormed out. We didn't talk again for two years after that.

2. My stepdad tries to kick me out of the house on my Mom's birthday just minutes before she's due to get home. When I refused to leave he grabbed me by the throat and pushed me up against the wall. I punched him in the face three times as hard as I could. Then he started wailing punches to my body and head so I shoved him off of me, punched him once more in the head then sat outside and waited for my mom.

mkvgtired,WTF,1388946069.0,"&gt; when Americans and politicians say America is the Land of the free, leader of the free world and the best country in the world...we know our flaws

I think you're making a lot of inferences that aren't necessarily true. Look at how many Americans on reddit disparage it. In school I was not taught the US was the best country in the world. We were encouraged to discuss, even at a young age, what the US could have done differently in conflicts like Vietnam, Korea, the nuclear attack on Japan, and many more. We talked about how the US used its position as a global power to influence foreign policy at home and abroad. I remember having a full class discussion in 5th grade about the other alternatives the US had to attacking Japan with a nuclear weapon and how many lives the decision to do so cost. 

&gt;this kind of thing just isnt said in Europe

I certainly wouldn't say that. Many right-wing politicians seem to think that Europe is for Europeans and it is the best place in the world. If you look at specific countries, many of them do think their country is the best and are vehemently nationalistic. 

Many Europeans seem to think all Americans are like these nationalistic politicians. If I thought all Europeans were like National Front, Golden Dawn, Sweden Democrat, or True Finns I would have the same view of Europeans. Luckily I know better. "

BullsLawDan,legaladvice,1388946081.0,"&gt;Like I said, the only thing they requested what that I sign a paper stating that I was a high school graduate. And this was only to qualify for the pell grant.

I'm just saying, before you accuse the school of all kinds of things, check through your documentation and everything they've sent you.  Look at the school's website and financial aid information.  Why do you think they would ""refuse to admit their mistake""?  They're losing money by not having you there.

If you can't find any reference to getting your high school diploma in the documentation they sent you, ask if they can give you some (in other words, ask them for what THEY think they sent you).

&gt;As for why I think it's discrimination, well I am a racial, religious, and sexual minority. When I connect the dots, which is this situation and all the hostile or at best indifferent treatment I've received from the financial aid office thus far I am convinced that they are trying to exclude me from the institution because they know I can't attend without financial aid.

And this is where you are causing trouble for yourself.  You can't spend your life claiming ""discrimination"" whenever things don't go your way; you will offend a lot of people, and make it so that people will not want to do anything to help you out.

Nothing you have said here leads me to think this is ""discrimination,"" frankly I think it's that you missed a requirement in the paperwork, and that you are giving them an attitude (because you think it's ""discrimination"") which is why they seem ""hostile"" or ""indifferent.""  Colleges have large incentives to admit and enroll minorities (by the way, if you're a woman, you're not a ""minority""), and their predisposition is to help students like you - *until the moment you start being impolite or copping an attitude.*"

Colres,AskReddit,1388946484.0,"This is too funny. The practical mind that came up with these questions..

There is underwear with holes in the back. Whatever practical advantage wearing underwear backwards may have is counteracted by looking silly. I like to think this is the gay version of a guy who has a pocket protector and a belt pouch for his calculator. An interesting fact about gay people that especially Americans don't know is that many of them wear European style boxer briefs. They are nice an snuggly on your junk, they make your rear look good, and they come in gayer colours. Tip to make your girlfriend happy: watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv82GbioYwQ) and learn what underwear should be like on a guy. Anyway, so this kind of undie 1. doesn't have a hole, you pull your junk over top to do your business and 2. they're tighter, so putting them on backwards doesn't work because they'd be baggy on the front and too tight on the back.

I don't know, is there? That completely changes from person to person. For some people it can change day to day, week to week even. So yes or know or maybe or who knows is a good answer to that question.

Aah, the final question. gay marriage? It works great. Financially, two men are going to earn more than two women. They are less likely to have kids, which also saves money. They can share things that a straight couple can't, so that saves money. These things help. I haven't been gay married or straight married so there's not much more I can say.

However yes there are churches that marry gay couples. It depends on the location though- in some countries if it's legal to get married, they have to be able to get married in the church because of discrimination laws. In some places it's up to the church to decide, or even up to the head honcho of a specific congregation. You'd have to be more specific if you mean in a specific place, although you may want to just google that."

stil0097,GreenBayPackers,1388946539.0,"You're still going to be cold. You have way to much cotton, and too many layers. What keeps you warm is not so much the fabric itself but how much air gets trapped between those layers. So many layers fitting too tightly and there will be no room for air in between your layers. And cotton sucks at keeping you warm. You want something synthetic, polyester probably, touching your skin. In the car, or somewhere else heated, you will sweat. When you sweat into cotton it will no longer be warm. At all. The more synthetic fabrics you have the better. Wear things like polyester sweatshirts. If you can get your hands on polyester fleece even better. If you can wear down or synthetic down, better still. Be well.

Ski patrol says it best: [How to dress](http://www.nsp.org/slopesafety/howtodress.aspx)

**TL;DR:**  You're still going to be cold. No air in your layers = cold. DON'T WEAR COTTON. Synthetic. Fleece. Down, or synthetic down.

Only when you point out the various problems with those systems does anyone point to any other countries, and when they do none of the ""backup countries"" are in any way really comparable to the US.

arcticfox00,asktransgender,1388946617.0,"I suppose they're confident in their ability, and want to stay consistent with their methods (much as other surgeons would prefer to have the area clear before starting).

mkvgtired,JusticePorn,1388946707.0,"&gt; we must actually conclude that african americans are significantly more likely to be charged with hate crimes than whites.

You're looking at population, not crime statistics. If you look at the percentage of crimes black people committed that were eligible for hate crime treatment, and how many were treated as hate crimes, and then did the same thing for whites, you could make the assertion that black people were more likely to be charged.

It seems like a minor difference, but without knowing crime statistics its impossible to say black people are more likely to be charged with hate crimes. "

&gt;I work as a loans officer in a rural branch of a small Canadian bank.
 
&gt;Sorry for your suddenly-sodden panties, ladies. 

&gt;Definitely not my dream career as a kid – the Fisher Price Banking Is Fun! playset is not a big seller – but when I lost my job selling computers in my early 20s I got this job and it stuck like soiled underwear. I’m okay at it and I’m a well-liked mentor to many of the staff, but I’m definitely a goofy round peg in a humourless square hole which is what ultimately led to my WTF shitstorm.

&gt;If I have to work in an office I’m gonna have a bit of fun. I love ThinkGeek. In my office I have a [Conan the Barbarian letter opener](http://i.imgur.com/xwQpqAjh.jpg), a [Salvador Dali melting clock](http://i.imgur.com/hG0OT5q.jpg) and a [magnetic levitating world globe](http://i.imgur.com/rm1luHbh.jpg) among other things purchased there, and as fate would have it this past Christmas in my stocking I discovered that my kids bought me an [Annoy-a-Tron](http://i.imgur.com/vfO4Usi.jpg). It’s a small device that makes maddeningly short, faint noises at totally random intervals and can run for 3 months on a watch battery, designed to be hidden to drive someone harmlessly bonkers. Here’s the description [from ThinkGeek’s site:](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/b278/?pfm=Search&amp;t=the%20thinkgeek%20annoy-a-tron%202.0)

&gt;*“The Annoy-a-tron will do its part to drive your co-workers slowly mad with its short and seemingly random beeps. And when someone does locate the Annoy-a-tron, they're not going to know what it is - which is almost as much fun as watching them search for it. Muahaha...”*

&gt;And hilarity will ensue!

&gt;Right?

&gt;As it turns out, much less than zero.

&gt;I came in early on a Monday and placed it behind a metal poster frame hanging on the wall in the office of one of my co-workers. I flipped the ON switch and went blithely about my day, waiting for a reaction and to share a few chuckles.

&gt;Monday came and went. Nothing.

&gt;Tuesday, nothing.

&gt;Wednesday and Thursday, not a peep. At that point I figured it was broken. Frankly, I kinda forgot about it. I had Friday off and I suppose I would’ve checked it when I got back the following week.

&gt;Monday comes, lurching out of the weekend like a reanimated corpse. As soon as everyone arrives, the manager calls all 16 of us into her office for an unscheduled conference call. I end up standing at the back of the group near the office door. She dials in and our district VP announces herself through the little speaker. I stifle a yawn. The VP then introduces our company’s head of security. My brow furrows. This is unusual.

&gt; “By now,” the VP says, “some of you know about the device that was found at your branch last week.”

&gt;*Device? What the hell? What kind of device could they possibly be talking--* 

&gt;*Oh holy Jesus fuck nuggets.*

&gt; “When it was found it on Thursday nobody knew what it was, so it was brought to the branch manager, who then sent pictures of the device to me—“

&gt;*Fuck.*

&gt; “—and I forwarded the images to our head of security. He couldn’t identify it but guessed it might be a listening device so he sent the pictures to the RCMP corporate crimes division—“

&gt;*Oh fuck me.*

&gt; “—as well as the Canadian Security Intelligence Services in Ottawa. They suspected it could potentially be a bomb—“

&gt;*Fuckity grand fucking canyon of fuck.*

&gt; “—so we closed the branch, told all staff to stay home and hired a team of investigators to search every square inch of the building over the weekend for any additional devices.”

&gt;If I had sat down ahead of time to brainstorm a worst-case scenario, I wouldn’t have even come close to this epic corporate craptastrophe.
I had no choice. I took a shaky breath, steeled my nerve, clenched my ass cheeks tight and tried to say “Excuse me” but choked out a pubescent squeak instead. I cleared my throat, interrupted the conference call in that stuffy room full of my coworkers and spoke up, telling them it’s a harmless noisemaker, taking responsibility and apologizing profusely.

&gt;The room was dead quiet. The VP slowly says thank you for speaking up, they’ll stop the investigation, and the call ends. Everyone files out. I ask the manager if she wants me to stay, but she says she can’t talk to me right now. She doesn’t talk to me for three weeks. 

&gt;I found out later that she was in her car with the device on the passenger seat when she got the call that it might be a bomb. She apparently burst into tears and nearly drove into a ditch.

&gt;The district VP threw a fit and despite my 17-year unblemished work record she tried really, really hard to have me fired. Ultimately a senior executive in the company understood my benign intent and overruled her. Luckily they didn’t charge me the $50,000+ in lost business, staff wages and other miscellaneous costs.

&gt;No, I don’t know why my manager didn’t just ASK HER STAFF IF ANYONE KNEW ABOUT IT INSTEAD OF SENDING A FUCKING URGENT MEMO TO THE ENTIRE FUCKING UNIVERSE. My office is full of a lot of things but common sense isn’t one of them.

&gt;**tl;dr: ThinkGeek + corporate zombies = fail.**

&gt;**EDIT:**
So *this* is what it's like to be the bottom in an upvoted Reddit relationship. My god... it's full of *stars*. 

&gt;Some clarifications:

&gt;* I don't work for ThinkGeek. I doubt they'd be allowed to use the term ""suddenly-sodden panties"" in their attempts at viral marketing.
&gt;* My post is as accurate as I remember (it happened a few months ago). I can only relate what was told to us during the conference call about the theories about the device and the involvement of the authorities, but I can't and wont verify if that's what they actually did. I'm not going to poke that particular dog with a pointy stick.
&gt;* Although my post focuses on my frustration about the overreaction to my prank, there's a reason I posted this in TIFU after I found out this subreddit exists. 'Cause I fucked up. As I mentioned somewhere in the comment deluge below, had I given a modicum of thought to the type of risk-adverse industry I work in, I never would've placed the Annoy-a-Tron at my work at all. There would've been no overreaction to have if I hadn't done this to begin with. And my office pranking days are dead and buried - my wife will make damn sure of that. If I even *think* about trying something like this again, my wife will shove an Annoy-a-Tron so far up my ass that I'd have Daft Punk vocoder farts.

&gt;He's in the hospital right now so I am writing this to make some sense of how stupid I am.

&gt;Basically I was bored last night and I called up my friend and a pizza (our plan was to play some video games and just generally be chill)

&gt;I got bored so I began setting up the table for where we would eat. I placed a knife on the table and sat down. I waited for a while and I don't really recall why but I began thinking about if I could still throw a knife like I could before. (I practiced throwing knives as a kid)

&gt;Basically I pick up the knife and start playing it with my hands and after some time I decided I would do it. I didn't want to damage anything valuable to I dragged my [bean bag chair](http://www.foamsolutions.ca/images/beanbag%20cutaway.jpg) to the other side of the room and lined up a shot.

&gt;The pizza arrives and I fix some money to go get it and I place it on the table and begin playing some video games.

&gt;About twenty minutes later my friend arrives and long story short he throws himself onto my bean bag chair.

&gt;**TL:DR Put a knife inside my bean bag and forgot about it. Friend threw himself at it and impaled himself**

skittlesnbugs,OkCupid,1388947252.0,"Looong! But I had fun writing and remembering it :)


Re-did my profile, probably too soon since my breakup. Intended to just spend a month or so scoping profiles and talking to random people. Less than 24 hours later I start talking to a really cool guy. His profile states that he travels for 5 days out of the week for work; and considering I get way too close to people way too fast - I figured that this might be the ideal situation for me. He'd only be avaliable to date on the weekends, and I would be able to still ""be me"" during the week. 


We bantered back and forth for a little while before I told him that we'd better meet up soon, else it'd take a week to meet. He agrees, and I suggest ice skating. Sadly it completely dumped snow on us Saturday; and the only rinks I knew about were outdoor rinks. So we switched it to walking up and down the pedestrian mall, and then finding somewhere to eat. 


I don't think either of us had a good idea of how we wanted to act. Or perhaps how we were ""supposed"" to act. Very shortly it almost seemed like we both regretted agreeing to this date. I couldn't remember anything from his profile, and he was saying things like ""I don't repeat myself. It was on my profile..."" After about 3 or 4 times of him saying this, I get a little mad and say ""Hey, I'm not going to apologize for not remembering your profile. I barely read people's profiles - I skim them, look at unacceptable questions, and then meet up with them to see if I like them in person. I see no reason to invest myself emotionally or mentally in information about a person I may never see again.""


From there, things actually swung around and went really really well. We started swapping stories and talking about a little bit of everything. We finish up with dinner, and neither one of us really felt like splitting ways. With the snow still dumping; neither one of us really felt like walking outside either. So we decide to head over to the theater near by and catch whatever movie was there. The only one that matched up with our time frames happened to be the Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Neither one of us had high expectations for this movie; so we decided to sit in the back so we could MST3K it up. 


Best decision ever! There wasn't really anyone around us, so we didn't try and hide that we weren't paying full attention. We were keeping quiet; so we had to keep whispering, which meant constantly having our faces right beside eachother and lots of bumping with the arms. He eventually grabs my hand to hold it; and after about half an hour of hand holding; I decide to kiss him. Which led to a totally high school - esque make out session in the back of the theatre! AWESOME!


The movie ended, and I'm a little high on the excitement. Again, we don't really feel like leaving each other's company; but there's not really a lot open at this point. We start wandering, and eventually pick Target as a decent place to wander to since it was warm. As stupid as Target sounds, it wasn't that bad. We stood around in the movie section and talked about what movies we liked, and which ones we hated. 


It was getting close to midnight at this point; so I decided to take him back to his car and finally part ways after more high school esque car kissing. I'm totally into him, and I'm definitely going to see him again. :) Half way wishing I'd held off on making the profile just so I wasn't going on a date so soon after a breakup; but I am very very happy to have met this guy. 


**tl;dr** Two socially awkward people go on a date together; nearly sabotage it - but wind up really really liking it. "

I will not date men under 25 and I prefer to date me who are at least 30. Younger men are still trying to figure out who they are and what they want out of their life and I don't like the idea of being someone's mom or life coach. Younger men also tend to be more insecure, indecisive, and eager to please. Lastly, young guys tend to have no idea what kind of woman they want to be with. Dating men over 30 helps me avoid dealing with unnecessary relationship issues and makes it more likely that they know what they want."

mmp31,progrockmusic,1388947394.0,"For the song, just listen to the lyrics.  It sounds like the first person account of somebody who was dipping into occult activity and was attacked by a demon while he was sleeping. He wasn't sure if it actually happened or not, but he is sensing that he is being oppressed.  That is the ""price to pay"".

Look at their albums...with I Robot, AI is an occult concept because you're basically playing God by trying to transfer your consciousness into a machine.  The album concludes with the song ""Genesis Ch. 1 V. 32"" which doesn't actually exist in the Bible, and I presume it's supposed to suggest ""And man created Robot in his own image, and he saw that it was good.""

Pyramids have been an occult symbol for a long time because of the supposed power they possess. The cover of Pyramid shows a picture of Alan Parsons waking up from an astral projection, and I think the song ""Hyper Gamma Spaces"" is supposed to be the soundtrack for an out of body experience.  Astral Projection is an occult practice.

The Turn of a Friendly Card focuses mainly on gambling and the power that it has over your mind.  It essentially becomes your god.  Playing cards and many other gambling games have occult history to things like Tarot.

With Eye in the Sky, we see the Eye of Ra is on the cover, and it represents the all-seeing eye of the divine providence. It has connections to ancient Egyptian sun-worship, as it symbolized the Eye of Ra (the sun god).  The sun is the morning star, translated into Latin means ""Lucifer"". 

Now, the name ""Lucifer"" being attributed to the devil is the product of a mistranslation in the King James Version of the Bible, and the term ""morning star"" is applied to Jesus Christ in the Book of Revelation.  So from a Christian viewpoint, the Eye of Ra represents the worship of a false morning star instead of the true morning star. Also, in modern times, the Eye of Providence has come to represent a universal divinity and not specifically the god of Christianity.  Either way, some Christians believe the symbol represents the worship of a false god, and worship of any false god equivalent to worshiping the Devil.  Indeed, there is a reason why the symbol has been adopted by organizations such as the Free Masons, who do engage in esoteric practices.  On his own website, Parsons says that the Eye of Ra is a spiritual symbol that has become synonymous with his identity.

Eye in the Sky has a song called Psychobabble on it, which, like ""May Be a Price to Pay"", is sung by Elmer Gantry. The lyrics to me just sound like a continuation of the idea of exhibiting symptoms of being possessed but trying to denying it.

On the Eve album, they have a song called ""Lucifer"".  If you look at the cover of the Lucifer single, you can see Alan Parsons giving a very demonic look to the camera: http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1058/5115934126_f7427e6810_o.jpg

The cover of Stereotomy has a goat head on it, which is a demonic symbol. The ouroboros on the Vulture Culture album is an occult symbol as well."

Sure, we have conventions now as far as POWs go, but these, even, are socially constructed. Good luck getting a thief to convince you of your right to property.

Rights are socially constructed. They rely on human social conventions to be recognized. They can be almost anything we want them to be. Without humans to recognize them, rights don't exist. In a state of nature, you're guaranteed nothing, not even your right to life, since only the strong survive and the weak die out.

That being said, I think basic income can be seen as a right. In a society as rich as ours, I think it can be argued everyone has a right to basic sustenance. 

Where do you get your concept of rights from? Why do you believe thet exist? I know what the textbook definition is, yada yada, but if I'm not mistaken, it's generally assumed they're ""self evident"" (in which case I'll disagree), and it often comes off as an extension of divine command theory (""God endowed them to us""), which I also don't subscribe to, being an atheist. Although, if you're a Christian, I'll find it funny how you ignore Jesus' teachings about caring for the poor."

It's the most annoying part of the game. I love Gyarados, I've been using it since the first time I got gypped out of my $500 before MT Moon. But I never wanted to use the Dragon Dance Mega Gyarados until I had a 7 battle streak with 5 different people and they all had exactly this moveset. I'm perfectly fine with using my favorite Tentacruel to completely destroy their noob tactics but like I always say about Talonflame too, I try new things every time I battle. I shouldn't have to carry a hard counter for a specific pokemon into EVERY battle because I know the opponent values a victory over having fun playing the game.  
  
And don't even get me started on the Japanese people on Battle spot... I can't have two people with Black Sludge but they can bring out Kyogre and Mew? Legendaries in general actually. People think they're so good using Yveltal and Xernes with their Mega Mewtwo and now they can use Coballion and Terrakion too? They're not very hard to beat but it just breaks my heart watching my favorite pokemon get wrecked just because their stats on paper don't live up to how awesome they really are.  
  
Okay, one last thing. I don't know why, it might be Shofu or his copycats using tryhard teams in a truly competitive environment, it might be just straight noobishness, maybe it's the same 12 year olds who use Target Finder LMG in Black Ops 2, but I hate seeing people use copy-paste movesets from Smogon. I'll never understand the purpose of making Absol or Tyranitar only to Sucker Punch my Mega Alakazam 5 times in a row, allowing me to set up the perfect calm mind monster! Just use night slash, I know you all have it! He's made of paper anyway, a stone edge crit will do 200% damage."

athrasher,stopsmoking,1388947595.0,"My post wasn't meant to be read as ""use the patch right now"" but rather as an anecdote from someone who ran into similar difficulties quitting.

I could make it a few days, but then the buildup of life's stressors, combined with the increased agitation of withdrawal, would drive me back to cigarettes. OP may be nearing the point of nicotine leaving his body, but he is far from finished with nicotine withdrawal.

I'm just saying that if OP gets to a point where the combination of nicotine withdrawal and his/her job makes it too hard, the patch is a great alternative. It's not something that you even think about after you put it on, so it doesn't introduce its own habit, and if you use the multiple steps, it provides a pretty damn easy-going path to being nicotine free.

YMMV, but I had been trying really hard to quit for the last 6 months, and didn't make it past a week until I tried the path."

Fizjig,iosgaming,1388947754.0,"The only way you could justify some of these games being more expensive is if their were demo versions of said games to determine if its worth the money.

There are only a handful of truly worthwhile games on IOS. Some of the games I have paid for over the years have turned out to be complete crap. 

With Apples no return policy on apps it would be hard to justify paying $10-$15 for a game that may, or may not be a complete joke. 

The only other justification for raising the price would be the removal of IAP from games. It's hard enough to justify .99 on a game that ends up being pay to win. For me it's simple. If a game relies on IAP I simply wont purchase it. Telltale games is the only exception to that rule, because by default you are paying for the episodes as they come out. 

IAP has ruined IOS gaming for me. I don't trust the games, and paying more to play them is not something I would ever do. If a developer wants me to pay extra they need to do 2 things.

1. Ditch IAP completely.

2. Offer a demo of their products.

These problems always have went away after a few weeks, when the guy gets more comfortable with me and less nervous.

My only suggestion would be to keep things low pressure and just go with the flow. I am not a fan of scheduling first time sex, precisely because it creates too many expectations. Better to just plan a night of 'mutual exploration' and if PIV happens, great. But if you are too nervous for things to work properly, there is always oral."

I actually have a great story! November of 2012 I was finally going to get my breast reduction. I was 17 then and extremely nervous. My surgeon actually had to give me a prescription for Valium just so I could sleep the couple of days before the surgery. Now before I get to the day of the surgery I'll tell you about the visits I had beforehand. Every time I went to his office his nurses always made sure I was comfortable. They always made me feel like I was basically their daughter. They would joke around and made sure I was informed on every single detail. Even the surgeon would treat me like family. 

Once the day of the surgery came I was a bit calmed down since I already knew the nurses and my surgeon very well. The surgery took place in one of those centers specifically made for out patient procedures so they also had their own staff on hand. After waiting for a bit they finally called me in and gave me my robes to change in to. Once I stepped out of the bathroom with my robe on I was greeted by this older nurse who I had never met before. She was so dang sweet to me the whole time. The first thing she did was give me a little heart sticker to put on my robe so it wouldn't look so bland. Once I was lying in bed getting my IV's put in I had a group of about 4 or 5 nurses just sitting there and chatting with me while they hooked me up. They asked me all about school, my friends, my hobbies, and we even gossiped about boys! They literally treated me as if I was a longtime friend. The thing I remember the most though is that they constantly brought me heated blankets while we waited for the room to be set up. Everything was amazing and a great experience for me.


TL;DR: Treat them like you would treat your own family. That's what the nurses did to me and I've never been more comfortable in my life."

I wouldn't like someone saying this to me, probably because I would be disappointed that I don't get to look anymore. I also expect that I'd be nothing but flattered if it happened to me, if I had a female roommate or something like that.

But I understand why you'd find it uncomfortable. And on the one side, it's important in a roommate type situation to make each other comfortable in the limited space you have. 

But I live in another country, one where being naked in front of people is normal. Everyone showers together in school, everyone dresses together at the public pool (males and females separately of course). As a gay man, I don't have a problem with it and neither do my straight friends. I'm with them in a social setting, that part of my brain is not activated. I'm not too familiar with the way things are in the US anymore, but last I was there that kind of thing is far too taboo.

bombeater,OkCupid,1388947991.0,"It's a total random chance. There are so many hundreds of thousands of factors that enter into determining whether you're compatible with someone. Are there women out there who prefer smaller dicks? Yeah, there really are, but what people in this thread are getting at is that *it is such an irrelevant compatibility factor for many women*.

I wasn't kidding about my tl;dr, dude. I dated a woman once who wished my dick was much bigger. Eventually we went out and bought a unisex strapon together. I fucked her silly with that, then when she got off, I removed it and finished with what God gave me. She said it was some of the best sex of her life.

That's what everyone is trying to get at. Ultimately it's just not that relevant. If you lie there next to every girlfriend thinking, ""But wouldn't it be better for her if she thought my dick was perfectly-sized?"" you're gonna deny yourself AND the women you date a ton of positive experiences.

We're all harping on it because the confidence issues *really are* more likely to leave a woman dissatisfied than the dick size issue. Think about it: don't you think there's a version of your original story where the guy laughs right back and says, ""What, you think just because I'm working with a smaller tool means I can't make something enormous happen?"", and proceeds to show her a great night anyway?

I'm not criticizing you for reacting the way you did (for all we know, that chick might have intended not to have sex with ANYONE that night, and went out with the  specific intention of getting her jollies by being awful to you), I'm just saying: your dick is only as much of a liability as you want it to be. Confidence is sexy. Really, really sexy. It won't be easy to get over your self-doubt, but it's possible and it's worth the effort."

I'm very definitely a dog person and love just about all of them (definitely partial to large/giant dogs, though) but bloodhounds seem to have just a particular kind of sensitivity that I really resonate with and love. They come with a lot of difficulties, for sure, but I wouldn't trade that affectionate, goofy personality and that bond for anything.

You could justify all sorts of chicanery just by saying ""because society,"" so in the spirit of *Stormfront or SJW*, let me demonstrate:

&gt; Yes, but you interact with society and it's in societies best interest for blacks to be sterilized. Sterilization is only a fraction of the cost of raising a child in the welfare system or having more parents dependent on welfare services to raise their child. The welfare system isn't exactly known for perfectly turning out fully functional members of society.

When I say men are disposable, i'm not saying women are just burning through men, but that inherently we are on a wider social level. Men have to create value for themselves, which is why they push so hard in the political and economic fields. 

You know, a very obvious case is how men are last off the boat, first to war, sacrificial for their family and so on. But there are obviously more subtle nuances. Here is a great video from a popular youtuber one the subject. She can sum it up much better than I could.

Start by slipping a finger back there during a blow job, playing with the anal opening, slipping it in, and massaging his prostate. If he enjoys this and it doesn't re-open his past trauma, then gradually move to butt plugs, prostate stimulators (like the aneros) and then finally work up to a strap on. But starting off prostate play with a strap on is a terrible idea, even for a man with no history of sexual trauma.

My bf loves it when I fuck him with a strap on, and I love it too. I think it's super hot how much pleasure he gets from his prostate. The orgasms he has with something in his ass are unreal. I never thought it was possible for anyone to come that hard until I saw it for myself. We started anal play on him very early in the relationship, and I was very comfortable with the idea, as I had routinely done prostate massage with previous boyfriends. Both of us were turned on by the idea of taking it further. Even so, it took four years for us to work up to full on strap on sex, and I'm glad we worked up to it gradually."

So, yes ADHD exists, its very real. The biggest problem is that FMRI brain scans are not being used as part of the diagnostic path, which is malpractice. You can't really diagnose ADHD in a differentiable way from depression, and anxiety (and other comorbidities) without a FMRI brain scan.  So if you do the diagnosis without the brain scan, you are very likely to end up treating the wrong problem.

HoneyBearTaco,atheism,1388948523.0,"&gt; Having as many true beliefs and as few false beliefs as possible will help you make better decisions in your life 



I disagree. I see no lack of success in the lives of people regarding their religious beliefs. The family that the individual is born into plays an immensely important role in that child's success. If religion was the problem, no Sarah Palins would be walking around society today.


I found the point of the article to be an attempt at enlightening the ways in which some of the lowest members of society cling to religion because that is all they have. I don't think the author was condoning, in anyway, the lifestyles of drug addicts, prostitutes, or the homeless. Rather, I think he wanted to address the issue he has with speaking about religion with vast generalizations without considering what it means to some people who have nothing else. 

I think his point, and the point that led me to call this article ""poignant,"" was that in the end, as atheists, why the fuck would we really care as to criticizing the beliefs of individuals who have been born into families that send them out at age 13 to serve as sex slaves? If the religion itself holds a direct correlation to or causation with the lives of prostitutes, drug dealers, what have you, then the issues should be addressed appropriately -- but empathetically, mind you.

Until there is any direct evidence showing that religious people are homeless, or that being religious during homelessness, drug addiction, or prostitution will lessen one's chances of escaping the cycle, it seems pointless and insensitive to me to ridicule the religion, itself. Constructive criticism of the way in which the religion is used, certainly. But merely mocking the religion as a whole, which is the practice I think this author is referring to, seems far more inhumane than allowing religion to remain in society"

I guess some gay guy wanted to have sex like straight people, made do with the holes available, and figured out how to make it feel good.

lil-praying-mantis,AskReddit,1388948587.0,"I almost committed suicide my senior year of high school, and nobody would've seen it coming.

I had no clue how much I would hurt the people around me. My family would be so devastated. An empty spot at the kitchen table where I usually sit, my Christmas stocking forever empty, one person less in all our family pictures, and my birthday would always be a day of sadness. I would miss out on all the goals I had dreamed up my entire life, like getting married to the perfect guy and having kids. Hell, I wouldn't even see gradation day, and I spent 12 years of my life trying to get there. I made it to gradation day and am currently going to graduate college this spring.

Sometimes I look around me and feel sad that I almost took all of this away. If I killed myself in 12th grade, that boy who ended up having a huge secret crush on me would spend his life wondering what could've been... if only he had spoke his mind to me. Now he's my boyfriend/ultimate best friend who plans on proposing to me in the next few years.

hotbox4u,AskReddit,1388948926.0,"Well, im too late to this discussion but i like to contribute as well. Like you i have made this travel. You theroy is interessting but wrong at a crucial point. Facism wasnt a bigger thing in prenazi germany than it is now. Only Hitler/the NSDAP made is so popular. The facsim movement was very weak and small and only ganined influence because of the charismatic and brillant rethorical speaker Hitler was.

Here is what what happened if you would kill Hitler early enough:

Lets assume you have one chance to go back in time and you choose to bomb Hitler at the Hofbräuhaus at the 24. February 1920 where he would held his first important speech infront of 2000 people. You choose this point in time because Hitler hasnt done anything yet but you still want to blow up as many early nazis as possible. So you blow him up.

 Bang.

Great. Is it? Well... This doesnt change much for europe. You killed a guy and some of his racist party friends. But the social unrests in germany proceed to result. Another person, wich equal rhetorical skills and charisma will apear. We will call him Argos, just for the fun of it. He gets elected the same way Hitler got elected but he will do this on a different political platform. But WW2 will still happen but the holocaust does not.

Argos is the contrary to Hitler. He is not insane.(Well he is, but in a much more dangerous and controlled way.) Hes not megalomaniac and he is a brillant strategist who will listen to his Generals. (Which are still the same Hitler got.) The German forces are now much stronger because of this. Argos could form a mighty german army where religons doesnt matter. He forms his army after napoleonic morals which makes his army superior to any army in the world, by moral, education and technical advantages. Still he kills all and everything that thinks otherwise to his party believes. There is only one Argos.

Argos expands into poland and fortifies his position instead of continuing to expand into the East. Same as Hitler, Argos takes in a Blitzkrieg fashion the Benelux, France and kills all the British Soldiers at Dunkirk, leaving Britain shattered. But then he stops. He plays the political game and stabilises the geopolitical situation for now. Now, not only are the german forces much much stronger, but most of the german intellectual elite has never left the country. In fact noone defected because Argos gives them all the Resources they need and scientists do what they do best under such conditions. They invent and build. Van Brown works in Pennemünde, without all the hassle the nazis gave him, on long distance rockets. Einstein, while not a fan of Argos and outspoken against the war, never had a reason to flee the country. He keeps working in Berlin.

The german counterpart of the ""Manhatten Project"", the German nuclear energy project, short the Uranium Club, is Argos pet project. The Uranium Club is therefore much faster in their research, because all the physicists, engineers, and mathematicians who were driven out of Germany by Hitler as early as 1933 are still there and working as hard as they can for Argos. Also the USA doesnt have much time to look closely at Europe because they are focused on the Japanese Movement and the developments in the Pacific Area. Germany develops the atom bomb.

A german nuke carried by the japanese fleet hits Peral Harbor in a preemptive strike. Argos forces the surrender of all major nations on the continent after decimating every other capitol city with nuclear weapons. Europe becomes a single nation headed by a dictator. Building an entire eastern Powerbloc and threatening the rest of the world. The US is forced to expand into canada, mexico and south america to fortify all possible points of entry for nuclear weapon drops. Both continents enter into a war that nobody is sure who will win."

I first joined one of their Long Island locations, when I moved I switched to SoHo because it's closer to where I work, but as you mention, it's small and crowding is a problem. I would go in the morning though and so crowding wouldn't be as bad. I was gonna cancel my membership but a manager there said they'd be opening the Astoria location and told me when they signed the lease (that was last spring). I haven't been to the Steinway location yet since I live closer to Ditmars but I would assume it's just like the other ones I've been to: Clean, friendly staff, great environment.

The plans are good too, you can always upgrade, so if you start with their cheaper one that's probably 15/mo or maybe now it's 20 it's no contract and if you sign up for at least a year at 20/mo you can bring a friend with you EVERY TIME and go to every location (tho i saw if astoria is your home location you cant go to soho)

When you pull the string back the force will keep you bow in your hand plus that by squeezing too hard your hand will move and trow off your aim. 

Also make sure that your arm is in a &gt; shape away from the bow (the &gt; symbol is a bit exaggerated ofcourse) this make that the string doesn't hit your arm which will hurt both your accuracy and arm (speeking from experience here. Walked around with a 5 inch mark for over 2 weeks) 

Lastly hook your fingers around the string. I know it's a fake bow but with a real one the force you need to pull the string back will make your arrow slip from your finger before you've fully drawn and you won't hit with the full force. Anyway great work "

Also, if your girlfriend really has PCOS, she is likely to have difficulty conceiving even without the Pill. Many women with PCOS need to go on Clomid in order to ovulate and conceive a child. It is highly unlikely she will get pregnant on the pill, especially if she remembers to take it every day. The most important thing to do on the pill is to make sure you don't start your next pack late (i.e. your placebo week should not be any longer than 7 days). Starting the next pack late is the most common way that women get pregnant despite being on the pill.

I was maybe 10 years old at the time.

I read every word of coverage of his trial, and that introduced me to several other concepts that I would much rather not have known about, including anal sex and the fact that Bernardo preferred younger girls.

Truth is that if I see a cute white girl and a cute girl that is my girlfriend's race I'll probably think that the girl of my girlfriend's race is cuter.

SilenceIsOptional,depression,1388949400.0,"You're already on the right track with therapy. It's not a quick fix by any  means, but it is an important step in getting yourself into a better mind -set.

I feel for you. I can relate to growing up being treated like a pariah by your peers. It cuts deep. Coupled with high standards set by your parents, I can see how your own self image falls in the realm of just not good enough. And the anxiety and isolation... It's lonely. It's painful. And I'm sorry you have had to travel this path. 

As cliche as this sounds, you have to learn to love yourself on your own terms. You're always going to come up short when you use someone else's measuring stick. Take some time to get to know yourself. Write, make art, take a walk in the park, learn a musical instrument. When the time comes you can use the things you're passionate about to make social connections. 

Be kind to yourself. People come and go but you will always have you, so make sure that relationship is a good one. 

And if you ever just want to talk, or have a sympathetic ear,  please feel free to PM me. 

Good luck. I wish you the best and sincerely hope that you find what you're looking for in life. "
duffmanhb,politics,1388949408.0,"Exactly. Coupled with the fact that wartime presidents get reelected, and he probably wanted to create a legacy for himself, it put him in a situation where it would make sense to do something like that. It's a pretty rational move. I'd also go as far as saying that on top of this strategy he had, Cheney was also for it and though, ""Hey we can get a win-win, and I can also get some of that sweet sticky government money into Haliburton and raise my investment. So it's a win-win-win now.""

These people are just rational actors. There is nothing overwhelmingly malicious about it. Yes, politicians do make money off their decisions, but at the end of the day, they are still doing what they think is best for the nation. Though, sometimes they can just be wrong. 

But at the end of the day, it makes sense that Bush did what he did. The only fault was he didn't know too much about the art of war and made some really poor decisions. He thought disbanding Iraq's military was a bold strong move show of might, but in reality, you can't do that to such a foreign occupation. It just left a bunch of men that are trained soldiers, without a job and on the streets. So naturally they did what they did best and it spiraled into an insurgancy which fueled the entire region. That single move was THE worst move out of the whole occupation. "

The potential for harm comes into play when rational atheists clash with irrational religious fundamentalists/extremists.

I feel like you're trying to paint atheists as ""racists, nationalists, and bigots with an anti-humanistic agenda"" when the evidence doesn't really support that.

Publicly speaking out against Islam doesn't make you xenophobic or bigoted, which is something that Sam Harris and others have been accused of. The reality is, some people are so sensitive to the persecution of minorities (or religious *majorities*) that *they perceive criticism to be persecution or bigotry*.

hurston,changemyview,1388949608.0,"Asexual is merely an extreme. There are many more people with a low sex drive who are not considered abnormal. With the nurturing instinct, there are also many social pressures that make people who don't really want kids have them anyway. These pressures are starting to diminish in first world countries, so we are starting to see a lot more people with a low level of nurturing instinct choosing to be child free. This is actually quite common now the social pressures are being stripped away and certainly less than 'most people'. This is a process which has not yet ended and the future will bring more acceptance of the child free lifestyle.

The reward feelings that the nurturing instinct provides can only go so far in some cases to mitigate against the problems that children cause. The sort of things that the child free list as serious problems but parents say they 'just deal with'. Part of the function of the nurturing instinct is to lessen the downsides of having kids to avoid parents dashing their children against rocks, which would be bad for the species. If someone has a low level of nurturing instinct and you add other problems you mention, such as an unstable relationship, that can tip the person over the edge."

mkvgtired,cars,1388949776.0,"&gt;  I'm just shocked at how a communist government is price gouging its citizens like that.

They took a play right out of the USSRs manual. I was in Vietnam in the summer of 2012. In the rural areas you would see a huge house in the middle of people making a subsistence living. I asked a Vietnamese guy why this was and he said only party members were allowed to borrow from the state banks at far below market rates. They would essentially buy up a fiefdom and lease the land back to farmers at a high enough rent to barely allow subsistence. Essentially it is like new age form of indentured servitude. 

In Cambodia I saw a massive house with a Continental GT, Range Rover, and Lamborghini Gallardo out front. In Cambodia, and much of Asia, cars cost three times what they do in the US because of a tax on engines over 120CC. So keep in mind these cars were *far* more expensive than they would be in the US. Against the wall surrounding this mansion was a shantytown. A very prominent flag was flying out front, ""Cambodian People's Party."" Many Cambodians survive on $20 per month. This does not buy a great existence anywhere in the world. 

Anywhere you have these ""People's"" governments, you can almost guarantee there will be extreme exploitation. I know your comment was sarcasm, but figured I'd share my personal experiences. "

It did not matter what day of the placebo pill week it was and it did not matter if I had or had not gotten my period yet (turns out that I did not have it yet when the Nexplanon was inserted). I think based on what you said about your insertion date, you most likely are already protected. If it's making you anxious, then no harm in waiting 7 days after your insertion to resume sex."

screenmagnet,sex,1388950142.0,"I think the size of the vagina and the vaginal muscle tone may influence the size of penis that a woman prefers. But I think this is more relevant in the case of girth rather than length.

A woman's vagina lengthens when aroused, and the cervix rises and lowers throughout the menstrual cycle. Length preference has more to do with the angle of the cervix, how sensitive the cervix is, and whether a woman enjoys stimulation of her fornices (the pockets above and below the cervix). I love deep penetration because I love it when a penis hits my anterior fornix on every thrust. Also, my cervix is not that sensitive to pain, and it is angled such that it rarely gets bumped anyway.
Not all women enjoy deep penetration. For some women, it is only stimulation of the g spot that they enjoy during penetration, and since the g spot is only an inch or so inside, these women may not desire deep penetration with a long penis.

Some women who can't tolerate deep penetration may have endometriosis, which makes bumping the cervix or fornices extremely painful. Normally when the uterus gets bumped during sex, the ovaries sort of float away, thereby absorbing the shock. If a woman has endometriosis, often her ovaries are stuck to her uterus (so they can't float away), so when her uterus gets bumped, the force transmits directly to her ovaries, and this can be extremely painful.

In also follows that the names of those convicted and imprisoned must also be kept secret, so that the confederates of convicted terrorists will not find out that a terrorist who engaged in a given behavior was jailed for that behavior. 

Furthermore, it follows that the very existence of the facilities at which those terrorists are imprisoned must be kept secret, to avoid possible communication from jailed terrorists to their at-large compatriots about the laws under which the former were prosecuted.

DeathB4DNF,IWantToLearn,1388950565.0,"What's happening since you are altitude, the concentration of oxygen in the air is less. Your body still needs time to acclimatize to the decrease in oxygen. This will depend on how long you've already been living there and how your current fitness level is already. 

Improving lung capacity can be trained through aerobic exercise and resistance training. Swimming, running, biking, hiking,  all great things to help develop your lungs and the amount of red blood cells to help transfer usable oxygen in your blood and transfer carbon dioxide for expulsion. Similarly, by resistance training the cardiovascular system is also being trained.

For improving strength of the lungs you can look for devices used by respiratory therapists used to train patients with pulmonary issues. There are devices sold that mimic altitude training,  but are really just training the musculature of the lungs and the lungs, eg the [Elevation Training Mask](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00A9Y0L1U). As to this specific device's ability to actually work, I personally haven't used it and cannot attest to how well it works.

Another way to have better lung capacity, if you smoke, stop. As someone alluded to early, playing a wind instrument will also help as it is basically teaching yourself control of the lungs. Similarly, you can also take up singing. These can all help with lung capacity and lung strength. "

TheLastHayley,PoliticalDiscussion,1388950720.0,"Transwoman here. I sure hope so. I struggle with myself enough as it is, it'd be nice if society would not add magnitudes more struggle on top. As a transsexual you have to deal with the dysphoria (a sort've hatred and confusion towards yourself for your body), social trouble because nobody wants to know you as everyone thinks you're a freak, in my case an inability to have sex due to a mismatch down there, shame because you always feel so misplaced, guilt because you're perpetually envious of almost everyone else for not being born broken, alone because your family and friends will usually dissociate from you, anxious because of the inevitable harassment just for going outside, terrified or anxious because you think everyone will see through you when you're passing, scared because society expects you to out yourself even after everything's done with failure to do so being considered heavily dishonest... 

And this ignores the fact that treatment costs an arm and a leg (I'm in debt trying to fund electrolysis and hormones alone), the treatment is painful as fuck (aforementioned electrolysis is essentially having constant wasp stings in your face for 2 hours a week for years), the treatment can be a mixed bag of successes and failures (and death), you'll be harassed probably physically, maybe to the point of being murdered, you'll be misgendered galore which makes you feel othered, you'll find difficulty doing basic paper work because some places will resist you changing name and/or gender, you have to deal with people constantly insisting you're a fraud or a liar or a pervert, and even feminists insisting you're an agent provocateur or an insurgent and yeah...

And this only scratches the surface. It's no wonder 90% of us suffer from clinical depression and social anxiety, with 50% of us having attempted suicide. Forgive the bleeding-heartness, but an overwhelming proportion of my experiences consist of people really having very little understanding of what it's like to be trans. Really, really sucks."

bombeater,OkCupid,1388950848.0,"&gt; It's like, well she can just go out and find a guy who can actually give her what she wants.

In this hypothetical situation, she already did that, and it's *you*.

Do you see what I'm getting at here? If a woman is thinking, ""I wanna go out and get fucked by a big dick"", then yeah, she's gonna drop you, same as if a guy is thinking ""I wanna go fuck a redhead"" and a brunette tries to hit on him.

But I'm assuming you're not just in it for casual sex, which means you *don't need to worry about this*. If a woman's goal is not ""get fucked by a big dick"", but ""find a sexy wonderful guy to maybe have sex with"", there's *nothing in there* about dick size.

&gt; I don't know if I'd ever be able to get over it if a woman asked me to fuck her with something bigger than my dick. 

You're fundamentally missing something about the thought process that goes into it. What kind of activities do you do when hanging out with friends? Has a friend ever said ""Let's all go bowling""? They didn't want to go bowling because you weren't interesting enough. It's because *they liked you* and *doing fun stuff with you is awesome*.

""I don't know if I'd ever be able to get over it if a woman asked me to fuck her with something bigger than my dick"" is like saying ""I don't know if I'd ever be able to get over it if a friend asked me to do something more fun than just being around me"".

Why is it *bad* if a woman asks you to fuck her with a big fake dick? She's asking **YOU**! That's *fantastic*!

You *literally* just lived through the experience of what happens when someone can't be satisfied by your dick. She told you, ""Nevermind"".

If a woman wants *you* to fuck her with something else, answer me this: **WHERE IS THE PROBLEM**?

You already know that she *could* go out and fuck someone else, because you just had that happen to you, but that's not what's happening in this scenario. She is *specifically* deciding to ask *you* for something. To ask *you* to provide an experience for her.

You know that line from Fight Club, ""You're not your job, you're not your khakis""?

You are not your dick.

Say it into the mirror if you have to. No shit! I'm not kidding. ""I am not my dick."" I'm not fucking around here. You are really actually not your dick, and that is extremely important to be aware of.

It doesn't *matter* if your dick can satisfy a woman. It matters if **YOU** can satisfy a woman, and as long as you are willing to try and can string two words together, *it's possible*."
steadymotion,TheRedPill,1388950849.0,"&gt;A good first step would be being chaste yourself

No, I don't think so. That's bad advice. I'm not worried at all about my ability to attract chaste women. As RP theory states, a man's partner count only increases his value. And since society has already gone the way of feminism, I might as well enjoy myself with the available wares while I look for a suitable partner.

What's different about today (versus 1940s) is that low partner count women are the minority rather than the majority. So one has to look harder to find them, rather than being able to find them almost everywhere. But times change. I'm willing to adapt."

Alternately, it may be that there is a situation like the Amazon river delta, where the freshwater does not mix immediately with the saltwater, and because it is less dense, actually flows on top of the saltwater, so that there is a freshwater skin extending out of Leyawiin providing water for ships for some distance to sea.

Really, it depends on how much inflow Rumare gets, because if it's a relatively slow output, the salt will have eventually worked its way up, but if its dumping crazy amounts of water, the salt will be pushed back.

I personally want to go with the Amazon-river-basin deal just because a) it does get a lot of input, being at the center of the continent and having most things run towards it and b) that's damn awesome."

Even if competing wildlife is physically superior and better adapted to the environment.

Our larger brains are an exceptionally useful survival trait. More than you'd think. So yes, they would at least conquer mother nature. No doubt about it.

Why would I need a source for a simple question of probability?  When a man and a woman are in a sexual relationship together, the possibility of such a thing exists.  If something could happen, it represents a risk.  I don't think we need to construct actuarial tables to define the probabilities such an event could occur to accept that the risk exists. That risk doesn't necessarily imply that every woman is just waiting for the opportunity to get knocked up and manipulate their situation, which is why I added the caveat ""however slight.""

mkvgtired,WTF,1388951501.0,"&gt; most i am sure would abide by the propaganda and most watch fox news 

Again, you're making assumptions. Fox News has 2 million prime time viewers. That is 0.006% of the US population. By contrast the Daily Mail is distributed to 3% of the British population. 

Of the parties I listed in my previous comment, their popular vote percentage in the previous election was:

* National Front: 13.6%
* Golden Dawn: 6.9%
* Sweden Democrats: 5.7%
* True Finns: 19.1%

Some other European nationalist parties garnered far more support. Switzerland's got 26.6%, Norway's 22.9% and Austria's 20.5%. Claiming ""most"" Americans watch Fox news and abide by their propaganda seems like a bit of a stretch. And assuming nationalism does not exist in Europe is also a stretch.

So I'm not much help, though make sure it's what you want to do. Sometimes I get out of bed ready for work, other times I get out of bed wanting to kill myself instead of go to work.

I know that the EFTPOS machine will say accepted after every transaction. My job will look good on a CV, especially alongside a future university degree.

Your friends will likely all go straight to uni, and you need to have a plan to make sure you do indeed go to uni at some point. Gap years are fun, but they aren't a viable career option and studying is a lot easier to do when younger, so make a plan and stick to it."

Esoteric_Indulgence,TwoXChromosomes,1388951632.0,"I am also allergic to latex and have always used the LifeStyles (SKYN) polyisoprene condoms. Polyisoprene is one of the newer alternatives and it's essentially a synthetic version of latex. It has similar properties to latex, but does not have any of the allergenic properties found in latex. You still won't be able to use oil lubricants with polyisoprene because they can deteriorate the condom just as if it were a latex condom. Sliquid is an excellent water-based lubricant that I would recommend pairing with polyisoprene.

The other alternative (the one I thought I was going to try, but ended up not) is any kind of polyurethane condom. It's not as stretchy and will not feel the same as latex or polyisoprene condoms. However, you can use oil-based lubricants with them. The reason I never got to try these is because the stores in my area all stock polyisoprene instead of polyurethane.

Both alternatives are effective condoms that also prevent STDs, so I would recommend one of those two and let your partner weigh in on which one they like. I don't recommend lambskin, but only because lambskin does not prevent STDs."

I had one after both my sprogs were born and it was a tough decision, but there was no way I was going to bring another child into a failing marriage as I felt I really had nothing left to give at the time.

Abortion clinic staff are usually really great and do their best to make you feel at ease. They'll usually give you something to soften your cervix, which is really uncomfortable, so don't hesitate to say as much. They'll likely offer pain killers. The only glitch with mine was that, even though I was given general anaesthetic, I wouldn't go under (think it was the combination of ginger genes and bloody-mindedness - i really hate feeling out of control of myself) so I just kept talking about Harry Potter books and my kids. I could feel what was going on. It was uncomfortable, but not painful. They gave me lots of after care information and made sure I had all that I required (including resources for counselling, a script for pain killers, etc) before letting me go.

I have zero regrets about my abortion. Life got really tough for me (then failing marriage failed and things as a single mum of two were tough enough) and my sprogs in the year that followed. I was glad to not have another being to take care of when I barely felt able to take care of all that I already needed to.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask here or through PM and I'll do my best to field them."

umilmi81,Libertarian,1388951878.0,"[This video from Learn Liberty](http://youtu.be/AcWkN4ngR2Y) about the myth of Peak Oil addresses this question well.

In summary as a resource becomes harder to harvest the price goes up.  As the price goes up the incentive to find new caches, reduce use, and use alternatives goes up.

The world used to run on whale oil, but we killed all the whales.  We knew about crude oil long before the whales were almost wiped out, but whale oil is much more energy dense than crude oil, so it was preferred.  But as the natural resource got more scarce people were driven (by a financial motivation) to make crude oil ""work"".

Biofuels, solar, nuclear, wind, thermal, and tidal energy are all like crude oil today.  Crude oil is easier and more energy dense than the alternatives.  But as technology improves and crude oil continues to dwindle the price point of alternatives will cross the price point of crude, and you'll see a rapid and natural switch over to those alternatives.

You don't need to tell her the exact measurements, but you can tell her it is 'smaller than average'. That way she will be prepared. This also gives her an 'out' in case she decides she doesn't want to have sex with you. It will be a lot worse for you if she decides she doesn't want to have sex *after* she sees your penis than before she sees it."

Most of our problems are of our own making.  We muddy the market by obscuring costs to the end user.  We don't have competitive markets because most areas are served by a single large hospital system.  We need tort reform because lawsuits drive up the cost of malpractice and the costs are passed along to the consumer, but we'll never get it because of the trial lawyer's lobby and the fact that most lawmakers were/are attorneys.

The best policy I've heard suggested in the last few years was that a provider would set rates for various services at the beginning of a year, and all payers would pay those rates regardless of whether they're an insurance company, the government, or a lone individual.  Catastrophic coverage, especially when combined with concierge care, would be a much cheaper and more effective option for many people."

Excluding locations that would expect high amounts of bathroom traffic, such as movie theaters and airports, why can't every place with a bathroom for each gender just convert those to gender neutral bathrooms? Places like fast food restaurants, universities, coffee shops, and office buildings will rarely have more than one person in the bathroom at any given time, so why have a bathroom for each gender?"

jianadaren1,nottheonion,1388952074.0,"Powerful organized crime groups like the Yakuza or Cosa Nostra are pretty interesting: they're like an authoritarian shadow-government. In many ways they act like states in their own rights: they attempt to monopolize force and operate their own justice system (by establishing rules on who can and cannot be attacked); they collect ""taxes""; in some cases they provide public services that the ""real"" government has failed to provide (although they also provide private products and services like drugs and hookers).

In some countries like Japan, the government kind of tacitly acknowleges this and the state operates in this weird kind of federation with multiple levels (or orders) of government: the Yakusa carves out certain areas of responsibility (not unlike how a state or provincial government will carve out areas of responsibility in the traditional division of powers sense) where the government doesn't really interfere as long as the group ""behaves"".

In other countries (like the United States), the government treats this group like secessionists or rebels and effectively declares war on the groups (RICO, war on drugs). Unfortuately in the case of the United States and similar states, the real government often fails to provide the services that the people want (and the shadow government provides), like access to vices, so the shadow state always has support and resources and , if defeated, recovers like a Phoenix from the ashes. But not before a new round of violence to establish control in the power vaccuum, not unlike a war of succession.

gjinx,BabyBumps,1388952120.0,"I'm older but was considering terminating my pregnancy and it was really hard to make a decision when I told my partner blindly about my pregnancy. I had no idea which way I'd sway but I told him anyways. It made it much more difficult to make my final decision because I felt like I was being pulled all these different directions. So having at least an idea which way you lean is better than walking in blindly when you talk to him. As to how to tell him, I would just call seeing as that's how you stay in contact with him. When I see couples taking pics of the pee stick I feel like its because it's a planned pregnancy where you know for a fact both parties will be overjoyed. Even if you've made your decision to keep the baby and you are excited...it just doesn't seem right to push your elation onto him without giving him some digestion time to think things through. Talk to him like an adult...give your opinion/ decision...and give him time to think. Be realistic that he may not be overjoyed so prepare to say something that ends the conversation on neutral ground.

First things first though...you needs to make a doctors appointment to confirm.  They will give you a referral to an OB to see how far along you are. Discuss your options with your doctor. My doc referred me to planned parenthood if that was the route I chose. If you don't have insurance then I would just go straight to planned parenthood because they would do the ultrasound and counseling there anyways. You can even keep going there throughout the pregnancy if you choose. When I called they were super supportive and nice considering how terrified I was. My doctor made it sound like if I was planning on terminating then I go through PP, but I was surprised to learn they offer way more than that. PP offers you a chance to talk to someone who knows all the options you have. They have councelors that can just help you work through your thoughts. They are a great resource. They don't push you either direction...they are neutral...and they listen. 

Oh...and I'd start taking prenatal vitamins now. You can get them over the counter. Pregnancy takes a lot from you and you want to be as recharged as possible when trying to deal with emotional times.

As a prof, I can safely say that it's not just the RPG players that smell that way though. By about fifth week, LOTS of college freshmen reek because they are terrified to shower so have not (or have rarely) done it by the time that week rolls around. That's generally when, if I'm teaching freshmen, I have to put the banhammer down and tell them they have to shower if they want to continue coming to class. Yes, this is a thing.

I think geeks are generally more likely to continue being uncomfortable with communal showering that occurs in college (or maybe there are other reasons they care less about personal upkeep), but cripes. It is NOT limited to them.

Athletes generally smell okay because they shower after games/practice and got used to showering together ages ago. Sometimes I think they are so popular continuing into college because they are the ones that, in the beginning, are already used to traveling and living away from home and having to take care of odors.

So my grandpa passed away Sunday. I was still recovering from the flu and already kind of beaten up. The funeral was in Israel so I couldn't go. My family went. I was kind of alone and sad and just felt terrible. Everyone was celebrating because of the new year and I was just trying to get by.

****

**Monday**: 8 at 8:03 pace. Tired, sore, and grieving. Still felt good to run.

**Tuesday**: 6.5 at 7:57 pace with strides. Wrapped up the year at 2819 miles.

**Wednesday**: No run. Ended up in the ER with GI problems. At one point I was begging the nurses to kill me :(

**Thursday**: 5 miles at 7:58 pace. HUGE MISTAKE. Hadn't eaten in two days. Stomach hurt at the end of this, hobbled home, felt OK for a few minutes and then started shaking violently. Ended up with a high fever. That's what I get for breaking my ""no food, no run"" rule.

**Friday**: 8 miles at 8:21 pace. Probably still pushing it too much. Dead slow but what else could I expect after two days of no food followed by one day of light eating.

**Saturday**: Practice, 7.5 total with 3 miles at 7:00 pace, which isn't really a workout, then my coach sent me home because of my rough week. My brain was complaining because it wanted more, but in retrospect this was very good coaching and I am thankful. Did a little strength after, then pretty much spent the day in bed totally drained trying to eat.

**Sunday**: Hilly 11.25 at 8:20 pace in Discovery Park. Decided anything too long would have probably been counterproductive after being so sick. With some of the girls, pretty nice.

****

Total was only like 46. Not as much as I had planned. I figure that's OK given everything I went through this week. I have next week to step it up.

I need to figure out my chronic GI problems. This was my third or forth time over the span of a year in the ER with intense GI pain. I scheduled a bunch of appointments. 

Yeah I don't know. I feel like if there's a god he just decided to take a huge dump on me this week. I'm normally a pretty resilient person but by Thursday I just wanted to curl up in a ball and disappear. If you think it's hard to eat when you're grieving, imagine grieving and then going to the ER for GI problems. I went two days with pretty much no food, then two days of very light eating. Which meant zero energy. Which made running really hard. 

I guess maybe I'm just getting everything over with so I can have a strong, uninterrupted season."

The problem is that if those priors are marijuana (hell, drug) related, they *shouldn't be priors at all since it shouldn't be illegal in the first place.*

In no way did I mean that legalization would fix the economy (apparently my saying that previously went right over your head...so this probably will either). Hopefully this will help your understanding: help =/= fix.

Will legalization create jobs? Sure, legal medical facilities will likely become licensed dealers but you honestly think that current medical dealers are the ONLY people that would try to get into the industry? Why don't we compare the current LEGAL marijuana industry to a couple other ""sin taxed"" industries: alcohol and tobacco. Do you seriously believe that the current legal marijuana industry is as big as either of those industries and that, if legalized, it wouldn't (or couldn't) be just as big? Considering how many people use marijuana now even though it's illegal, you have to seriously be black hole dense to think that the industry wouldn't grow.

I made an assumption about what you're saying? You're making the assumption that I'm a stoner because I support legalization? Kettle, I think pot just called you black.

My priorities are fucked up? Where did I say that legalizing marijuana should be a higher priority than: education, educational debt, social security, government corruption, the economy, or immigration? Seriously, where did I say that? Maybe you should learn to read before you let your anger over knowing a few people are now free to do what they want takes over.

Any woman will tell you that there's something uniquely satisfying about being fucked by a real dick of just the right size, same as how any guy will tell you that masturbating doesn't feel as good as sex.

**BUT**.

I am pretty sexually experienced, and I can tell you this with great confidence: I don't have sex because it physically feels better than jerking off (it doesn't feel *that* much better), and **most women don't have sex because it physically feels better than using a toy**. Some do, and they are not to be ignored! But most women are primarily in it for the intimate connection. The way you hold her hips when you thrust, the way you look into her eyes when you're about to go over the edge, the way you go from treating her body like a porcelain doll to shoving her down against the bed. Those are all things that supersede physical sensation, and they're the stuff you should really be thinking about; not whether your dick is big enough."

PaulLattan,DebateReligion,1388952517.0,"&gt;the ideology itself is easy to reconcile with xenophobia in the current political context

I think it's easy to *interpret* atheism as xenophobia, especially if you aren't really listening to the core arguments or you're having them interpreted for you by far-left sources like the Huffington Post or Salon.

I recommend that you read the books written by Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, and Dennet as well as responses to their books and then the authors' responses. It seems like the most seemingly-cutting criticisms of their ideas come from people who either don't understand, didn't actually read them, or are deliberately trying to misrepresent them.

On the main point, you're arguing that ""New Atheism"" has potential for harm because it provides cover for people with bad motives to join the bandwagon. Let's examine that idea.

Atheists actually make a similar argument about religious moderates. 

For instance, moderate Christians and Muslims who simply want to practice their faiths and don't have any intention of pushing their religious beliefs on others or using those beliefs to justify harming others typically find themselves opposing the religious extremists who resort to terrorism, violent theocracy, etc. However, when we criticize the religious fundamentalists and extremists by pointing out the inconsistencies, fallacies, and flat-out falsehoods of their religious beliefs which have led to their violent and oppressive behavior, the religious moderates often chime-in to defend their religions with apologetic arguments. More problematic, however, is their social outrage that non-believers would dare to criticize their faiths/religions and claim them to be not literally true. This makes it become socially taboo to criticize religion and hinders our ability to appeal to religious fundamentalist extremists on an intellectual level (as if we don't already have enough barriers to that effort).

We can find examples of this phenomenon outside of the religious/non-religious sphere as well. Look at the Occupy Wall Street movement. We had vastly-nonviolent protest movement trying to gain public awareness of the problems of income inequality and the influence of money in politics. However, the movement was easily infiltrated by a small minority who used it as a cover for violent, anti-social behavior. The media was then able to paint the entire movement with the behavior of those who either weren't real members of the movement or those who failed to adopt its nonviolent principles.

This infiltration of OWS by people with violent intentions didn't make the movement's core principles incorrect, it just made them more difficult to accept because the messengers were perceived poorly. If I spoke in favor of OWS, I was immediately accused of supporting what amounted to domestic terrorism, even though I clearly never said anything along those lines.

Similarly, I'm sure it's possible that ""New Atheism"" can, unfortunately, provide similar cover for those who are legitimately racist, xenophobic, nationalistic, etc., but I think those people will be easy to identify and dissociate because they tend to have belief systems which are similarly dogmatic to the religions they may oppose. That kind of dogmatism is the antithesis of the school of thought the ""New Atheists"" are trying to promote.

The irony I find here is that I perceive the various religious communities as being much more racist, nationalistic, bigoted, and anti-humanistic than the atheists you seem concerned about."

She yelled at him that she ''knew how to fucking drive'' and proceeded to miss the corner, go up a grass bank and flip the car over on to it's roof. One of my friends got stuck inside and the rest of us just had cuts and bruises.

Some of it is that law enforcement is too busy to care, and some of it is because the users are there. I refuse to believe that poor people are immune to getting into drugs just because they can't afford it so they avoid it due to their intellectual capacity. A lot of people do things that they can't afford to do. No idea if that makes sense but I'm losing my steam of caring to argue.

Yeah ok.

As other users pointed out, she probably fabricated the sexual abuse. She only brought it up 22 years after her arrest, and there is nothing to support her claims. Intent is a huge part of the sentencing for crimes, and the ""affluenza"" case was obviously an accident, this was murder. I think that life in prison is a little steep for a 15 year old\, but you need to realize both sides of the argument if you're going to try to compare those two cases."

Colres,AskReddit,1388952867.0,"This is the same as asking why there are freedom marches in Syria but no oppression marches. Some places unfortunately still have laws restricting homosexuality, some countries still even have the death penalty for it. I've seen some documentaries (a recent one by Stephen Fry, especially) where gay people from countries where homosexuality is severely limited are interviewed. They say that seeing people express and celebrate their freedom gives them a feeling of solidarity and hope to keep pushing for their rights.

I know there are a lot of obnoxious things that happen around gay pride type events. But the way I see it (and I may be alone in this) it's not gay pride in the sense of being proud of being gay. I'm not proud of being gay any more than I'm proud of being white or left handed or anything else. I am proud, and extremely proud at that, of my country. A country where a parade or event is even allowed is something to be thankful for.

So to me that type of event brings two emotions. Joy in that I can publicly express love towards someone of my own gender, but at the same time sadness for my brothers and sisters that do not yet have the same freedoms."

I could be wrong, maybe you can cut back. If so, more power to you, and enjoy.

The reality is: there is no one way that parents act that is done specifically by one gender. A father can be just as nurturing as a mother, a mother can be just as encouraging as a father. 

Children do just fine with any parent, so long as that parent is loving and supportive. More than one parent tends to end up with a better child, but that is more based on the fact that a single parent is going to have to spend a lot more time working (usually) and not as much time with a child. "

Assuming PCPartPicker takes the processor and the graphics card with stock configurations, the system estimates 473W draw from the PSU.

Now, the lower the 80+ certification goes, the lower the power a PSU can deliver. An 80+ Bronze certificate requires 85% power efficiency. Now, let's say the PSU is under 100% load all the time and can deliver a full 85%. 550W * 0.85 = 467.5W. The PSU can deliver 467.5W which doesn't really reach that 473W estimate.

Unless the PSU delivers it's rated 450W (in which case it should be Gold or Platinum certified), then fine, you win. But OP has a budget and if that budget needs to be met, then his choice is quite limited, if he's to get a really good bang for buck. Not to mention PSUs can be reused in future builds, granted that the components do not consume more than the rated wattage.

Also, what hypocrisy. You suggested a build for OP and disagree with me trying to get him a 600W, yet you suggested a CX600? *slowly claps*"

mkvgtired,cars,1388953075.0,"Because they read The Communist Manifesto on their Kindle and then discuss it with other like minded people on their iPad. 

Most workers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia would rent a space to sleep on the floor between 20 other people with a mosquito net for $10 per month or less. The rest of their $20 was spent on rice and other food. That was their existence. Knowing the phone I was texting on would have paid for food or housing for a year for someone really makes you feel like a piece of shit. There was an unwritten rule, if you bought women drinks in a bar she would sleep with you (because they could not afford to go out) or that she was a prostitute. You would see young teenage girls with Western men playing on their iPhones. Child sex tourism was very tolerated because it brought money to their country. 


On top of that they're almost always more corrupt. When I was in Vietnam, I took a motorbike trip with an American and Australian I met there. The American guy lived in Vietnam and Thailand for a while and said ""the police will try to stop you, dont stop for them, they will just want a bribe."" Sure enough when the cops saw I was white several flagged me down to try and stop me and I just blew past. If for any reason you did get arrested, you could always buy your way out of it.

I traveled with a British guy that was in SE Asia for a while. There are shooting ranges in Cambodia where you can fire all the weapons left over from the genocide era. You can blow up a cow with a rocket launcher for $300 (which I find incredibly disrespectful in a country where people cant afford to eat meat). He went and shot an AK-47. When he was leaving they tried to upsell him on shooting the cow, and then the guy got quiet and told him, ""you can shoot a person with an AK for 1000 US."" Now keep in mind we dont know if he could or would have followed through, but given that the average income there was $650/year at the time, and many workers made far less, that was a considerable amount of money. Plenty to slide the police some to look the other way. 

That guy had a bit of a rough trip, he also saw someone get shot point-blank in Bangkok. He was sitting having his morning coffee, and someone walked up to someone on the street in broad daylight and shot him in the face. Then when he fell, he unloaded the rest of the revolver into his body. Apparently Bangkok has a significant amount of gun crime. That British dude wanted to get away from the touristy parts of Bangkok and experience the ""real"" city, guess he found it. He was shaking pretty bad telling me these stories.

Many redditors claim its ""not Marxism"" because of the wealth and power grab. Although they're right, they often wont acknowledge Marxism is what allows this power grab. When everything is state owned, or should I say owned and managed by the ""people"" its much easier to take control of it by powerful actors. 

People support these things because they look good on paper. But you just need to find someone who was lucky enough to grow up in one of these ""People's"" utopias to hear about how it really is. Its not hard to find them in the US. They almost unanimously despise their one party systems back home. I love visiting places completely different than the US, but I certainly understand why people want to emigrate from them."

&gt; I have dealt with many Hasidic landlords and they have all been scumbags. They wouldn't shake my buddies hand because he was black. One stopped talking to me in mid-sentence because he found out I was German.

Personal impression/anecdotal evidence doesn't mean too much. It's shitty that some of them were racist, but you should realize that they've almost certainly been victims of discrimination themselves. Not saying that justifies it, at all. Just worth knowing. As for the German thing, you realize he probably was or was related to a survivor right? If the only experience you've really had with Germans is ""they killed everyone of my relatives that they could, and forced the rest of us to leave our home and everything we owned in the world behind,"" you might also have some, ya know, lingering resentment.

&gt;Jewish people even have a word for the fact that they believe other people are second class. I'm sure you have heard the term Goyim.

First of all, saying Jewish people as a whole believe *anything* is pretty ignorant and/or anti-semitic. It's millions of people we're talking about; to impute a specific belief like that to all of them is just plain wrong. Second, goy/goyim is not inherently a slur. Plenty of people use it in exactly the same way as gentile, which just means anyone who's not Jewish. It's not like the Christian ""heathen"".

&gt;They scam the system by not paying proper taxes, hold some of the lowest literacy rates, and fuck over the welfare system.

As an explanation, I think it's rather simple to turn to, say, [Anders Behring Breivik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik), noted conservative nationalist assassin and mass murderer.

However, a better explanation would point out the Democratic Party's schism between the Southern Democrats, AKA Dixiecrats, who were more conservative, and the Northern, more liberal Democrats, and the post-1960s realignment of the parties that makes the political affiliation of people like Booth and James Earl Ray merely nominal.

jubbergun,TumblrInAction,1388953578.0,"&gt; Well your whole point seemed to be that anything other than the US system only works in smaller populations. Germany is hardly a tiny country yet their system doesn't seem to have major problems.

[German Population: 81.89 Million](https://www.google.com/search?q=germany+population&amp;oq=germany+population&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.4033j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8)

Not only is the population of the US more than three times greater than that of Germany, it is far more diverse population.  In Germany, there is going to be a bit more agreement about basic things like ""should public funds be used for abortions?""  Here in the US, somewhere betweeen 30%-50% of the people don't even think the procedure should be legal, much less publicly funded.  We still have court cases ongoing about conscientious objections to various ACA mandates regarding birth control from religious groups and small businesses.

snobord,AdviceAnimals,1388953593.0,"&gt; One: what does it do to industrial agriculture? Right now in America we pay farmers to grow our food in tax subsidies, because for the most part there's no money in it. Say, A soybean farmer. He can get about a dollar an acre. So a soybean farmer with 6,000 acres is going to bring in 6k. Thats not enough to even cover his costs. Let alone feed and clothe his family. So the government steps in and cuts him a check to make ends meet. Not just one check to grow soybeans, but a separate check to not grow tobacco. Because any farmer who's having a problem paying the bills is going to switch to Tobacco where theres a kings ransom of profit to be made.(So much for the free market right?) So how many Farmers will switch their crop to pot once it's legal? A metric fuckton I would imagine. Way too profitable to pass up that opportunity. See, you would create these multi-million dollar conglomerates in America overnight. You'd have the farmers on one end, and the equivalent of walmart or starbucks distributing their products on the other end. The entire dispensary model as it exists right now would become a thing of the past. Not just simply because the ""weed-mart"" would put them out of business. But because all the new regulations and FDA approval/inspections that would be created(or whatever agency we create to accommodate the practice) would make the dispensary model impossible.(See a lot of homebrews on the shelf at the liquor store?) Aslo, you know damn well the pharmaceutical industry(who's lobbied against legalization) will want in or a piece of the pie somehow. I never knew hippies were interested in creating giagantic all new corporations

To be frank, I don't know about the veracity of the claim that farmers are cut a check to not grow tobacco so, for the sake of argument, I'll assume it's true. That said, legalizing marijuana doesn't mean that suddenly no other cash crop would become worthless. Marijuana, like any other item on the market, has a certain demand. Once that demand is met, any excess is waste and I'm sure the soy farmer will soon figure out if he's growing sellable marijuana or he should go back to soy. Throw in the fact that there are different qualities of marijuana and not everyone will know how to make ""good"" marijuana people actually want, then you have even less people that would grow it because they don't know how. Let's face it, anyone could grow grapes and make some wine, but that doesn't mean you'll make wine good enough that people would actually want to buy it. If you don't know how to make wine, what do you do? You stick with soy because that's what you know.

&gt; Another aspect is , what does legalization do to liability insurance and claims? Right now in America, if you're working at Walmart and a pallet of 2 Liter Diet Cokes fall on you, whats the first thing they do? Drug test you. Why? Because if theres even a hint of pot in your system the insurance company is going to say you were high at the time of the accident. There goes your unemployment and compensation package. Doesn't matter if you smoked a join two weeks ago, the insurance is going to claim the accident occurred while you were stoned so they dont have to pay. What happens once its legal to people who are involved in other types of accidents, like automobile accidents? What if I'm driving along and a 5 year old darts out in traffic on her bike and they find pot in my system even though its legal? Flip it, what if some burn out runs over your little girl while he's rippin a blunt behind the wheel? We dont even have the tools to check if someone is currently high on marijuana.

I won't disagree with this. I'm not familiar enough with the insurance industry to do so. I will say that just because we don't have the tools to detect intoxication doesn't mean it can't be done (I believe I was just reading about them using blood to text for actual marijuana intoxication for DUI purposes in Colorado). Further, let's not pretend just because we don't have a means to test for it, keeping it illegal will somehow make people not use it.

&gt; Three: Lets talk Cartels. I keep seeing over and over again that the war on drugs would end all the Cartel violence, and hopefully it will. But, at the same time Marijuana advocates never seem to want to take responsibility for said violence. Do you people really believe that your hands are clean because you get your weed for ""Blueberry Jim"" in Colorado? You dont think theres a direct correlation between the surge in shootouts among the Cartels in Mexico and the rise of Homegrown in America? The market share is decreasing, and thy're killing each other to keep the scraps. You think the Cartels are just going to dissolve or evaporate into thin air once Pot is legal? No the violence will just increase for whatever remains. Then they'll just move their operation to other endeavors.(Such as human trafficking)

I'm not going to even pretend that legalizing marijuana will end all cartel violence; it won't. I certainly don't think it will. You're absolutely right, they'll find something else to kill over. Is your suggestion then that we should just make sure that they keep killing over marijuana? I mean, repealing prohibition certainly didn't end organized crime, but it sure as hell stopped most organized crime over bootlegged alcohol. Are you saying that you think that was not a beneficial result even though organized crime just went elsewhere?

My problem with the War on Drugs advocates is that after 30 years, they act like it's working and insist on the status quo."

As for JRJR, his style has evolved over the years. At one point he was fairly realistic compared to his contemporaries. Over time, more great artists have come along, and the style that is most common has become more and more realistic, while JRJR's style has evolved beyond a more realistic approach.

If you feel that you need to use husband or boyfriend (which they do use, and fiancée too), all the more power to you. But equality is first having the right to have a boyfriend, fiancée and a husband, and then to decide how you personally would like your relationship to look. Just because gay people now have the right to get married, doesn't mean they have to. Maybe common law works better for them, or a civil partnership for whatever reason, or just living in perpetual boyfriend-mode.

7th or 8th grade: a friend of mine and I are at my house and decide to have some cantaloupe, i cut some for myself and ask if he wants any and he says no, i persist that he does because cantaloupe is delicious he continues to say he doesn't want any, I go to cut him some regardless and cut into my ring and middle finger with the serrated knife while we were the only ones there at the house, he calls my sister because my mom's phone was off and proceeds to tell them I cut my fingers off, i had only somewhat cut into them, the ring finger lesser than the middle but it has left a butterfly scar right by the knuckle
tl;dr dislocated fingers riding in a wagon and cut two fingers when cutting cantaloupe for friend who didn't want any "

I don't see how you can say that wanking with a cam girl is cheating (you may or may not think that) yet wanking over two people who aren't interacting with you isn't.

On the divorce thing, there are plenty of people who end up in marriage counselling over porn, and not all of those incidences are instigated by the woman.

Airazz,PostCollapse,1388953910.0,"I've just finished watching it and yep, Planned Obsolescence is exactly that, just a conspiracy theory.

That guy's printer stopped working not because it printed a set number of pages, it stopped because the waste reservoir is full. Soon the ink will start dripping on his table. But surely this has nothing to do with his own idiocy, right? The table was *designed* to get dirty after a couple years.

Then there were the 30's and 50's. I don't know what it was like back then, I wasn't born yet. However, those things are hardly relevant in today's world.

That $27 printer won't last you very long not because it's designed to fail after 3 years. It won't last you very long because it costs $27. Metal parts are replaced with plastic, ball bearings are removed, lubricants are used conservatively, all to lower the price.

Buy a business-grade $5000 printer and it will outlive you.

Same with lightbulbs, they don't last as long as the one from 1901 because today they're much cheaper. You'll also notice that they're much brighter than that one, too. 

Performance and longevity are on the same scale. If you want more of one, then you have to reduce the other. That's why F1 engines have to be re-built after every race. They're not designed to fail, they're designed to output the absolute maximum. 

Oh, and that middle part about living in a Planed Obsolescence society? It's not planned, we simply want newer, nicer stuff. You're familiar with Moore's Law, right? Well, don't expect that this new phone you bought recently will be just as capable in 10 years.

Everything moves forwards. If you decide to stop, then you will be left behind.

As for Anti-Growth people, that's just dumb. Why don't we all go back to the 60's, sure. Forget all the advancements we've made, forget quantum thingies, the LHC, the Space Station, Mars rovers, everything. Let's just go back to coal age."

Fog accumulation is not a major source of water for redwoods. It does occur, and it does benefit trees during periods of low rainfall, but those trees could not survive if they couldn't regularly pump water from their roots to the heights of their crown.

Furthermore, water is typically designated as the limiting factor for tree heights. If trees *could* obtain a significant amount of water from fog, it is reasonable to expect that trees would grow to much taller heights than they currently do.

Additionally, not just redwoods exhibit fog absorption.

aidenr,magicTCG,1388954487.0,"The paralysis comes from misunderstanding the availability of cards. Try this: pick a random card, look it up on TCGPlayer, and count how many vendors are selling copies.

Armed with that knowledge, you can set aside the fear of needing a card later. Think instead like this: is the long term storage and tracking cost of 100 cards greater than the shipping cost for a single play set? (Hint: storing and tracking sucks way more than buying). 

Dump (almost) everything that you don't have in a deck! Likewise, don't save your good cards for future decks; build them into decks you have. Getting rid of commons is profitable."

Only downside is most of the time, to get these types of coins, you need to train or be at special events a lot. Over the RED event so far, I've collected about 400 coins. So that's an easy 400m. My girlfriend buys the NX Surprise Boxes and sells perm NX for money. Last way I make money is I go solo palp, pianus, and zakum(normal and crumbling) everyday and NPC all the drops.

I need to add that having children is not this horrible experience you have imagined it to be. Believe it or not, parenting comes with an entire set of adventures that don't even touch your bucket list. Things that will never be on that list. Likewise, this may come as a surprise but-*you* do not fail to exist as a separate person once you have children. Yes there are sacrifices. And some of those sacrifices you may find down the road, you have to make whether or not you have children.

Annnd, you can travel with kids and include them in many things you mentioned. But if you are unwilling to hear that or still, know in spite of those things you don't want kids anyway, do not have them.

I will tell you why, above all other reasons; as a society we already have plenty of non-participating fathers (whether they check out mentally/emotionally or leave the picture). Do us all a favor and don't have children unless you want them and, lastly-let her go to live her life too."

screenmagnet,sex,1388954801.0,"Actually, her fornices are deeper than her cervix. Think of her cervix as a smooth, round mound (like a 3D bell-shaped curve -- sorry for the geek-speak) protruding upside down into the vagina. If you were to take your finger and run it all around the outside base of her cervix, your finger would be in her fornices.

I have heard that the birth control pill can make the cervix more tender to touch. I'm not sure if this is true. But if it is, it could explain why it's not painful to get it bumped (just feels a bit weird) for me, since I'm not on birth control.

In my experience, the best position to really hit the anterior fornix hard and deep is doggy style with the man almost sitting up on his heels and the woman almost sitting up on his penis, with her back heavily arched forward (I place a pillow under my stomach and curl my body around it to help maintain the arch). This position also stimulates my g-spot simultaneously with my fornix, and I reach between my legs and play with my clit. Gives the most awesome orgasms. 

As far as thrusting style, you want to grab her hips and do short, quick, hard thrusts upward/forward. The key is to really slam hard against her at the end of the thrust so you transfer the momentum. Sometimes I start off by riding his penis while he stays still until I find the perfect angle, and then he takes over from there.

I mean, if you do, it has to be violent and dictator-esque. You have to rule it under your thumb. But that's hard and costly. So in theory, the best route to take is to let the current leaders of the state that aren't killed to take control. You make them pledge their allegiance to you and let them do what they want. The idea is, you aren't rocking the current power structure, so there wont be a lot of but hurt former leaders trying to use the new chaos to rock the boat.

There wasn't much for me to do, since I was so little, so I basically just hung around. At one point though, I saw a volunteer smashing up little pieces of wood with a hammer (I assume he was doing this to make things easier to throw away or something). It was one of those hammers with the two fangs on the back that you would usually use to pry nails out or as a makeshift crowbar. Anyway, I saw this guy smashing away and asked if I could help out. He said, ""Sure"", handed me the hammer, and walked away. I took a little piece of wood and started hitting it. After seeing that it wouldn't break, I decided to give it all I had. I reared my hammer arm back and ended up clocking myself *with the two fangs* right in the back of the head. Immediately, I dropped the hammer and held my hands over my head. After a while, I removed them and saw that they were covered in blood and it began dripping down the back of my shirt. After screaming hysterically, I had a stroke of luck.  Turns out that one of the volunteers there was a paramedic. And his solution? Tie my hair in a knot over the wound and it'll heal in a few days.

mkvgtired,cars,1388954891.0,"A year ago today I was in Northern Iraq and Turkey. You could see the difference in development levels between Northern Iraq and Eastern Turkey. You wouldn't guess it but the amount of development in Iraq is obscene. They have a long way to go. Many roadways will abruptly end in mud, but they're working on it, and working on it quickly. I will be the first to admit, oil money helps this along. But Venezuela is the perfect example of a very oil rich country that stifles development. 

In Northern Iraq the USD is a de facto alternate currency. There are not restrictions on holding it as there are in Venezuela. Private business is encouraged. Oil is taxed heavily, but privately owned businesses are taxed at zero or near-zero rates. I met an Iraqi Kurd CPA from Miami that started a business selling cosmetics in Northern Iraq because the business climate is now so friendly. 

You see 50 story buildings being built and new roads being built. Contrast this with the repressed Kurdish region in Turkey and the differences are striking. Only a river (and extremely bureaucratic border crossing) separate these vastly different worlds. Granted Northern Iraq still has plenty of problems, but it is the best example of the explosive growth that happens when barriers to economic activity are removed that I have personally seen. 

China is another (oil-free) good example of this, but I was there in 2010 when much of urban China was already pretty modernized. Although still one party, they consciously made changes to make China more business friendly, and the ensuing growth is obvious. 

[Here is a long writeup and map I made of my trip to Iraq.](http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/18bsur/my_writeup_and_travel_tips_on_northern_iraq_and/) Because there is such a lack of information, I started off making a ""how-to"" list, but it kind of turned into a story."

Early access is a *good* thing, especially for under-funded developers. It gives development teams with good ideas a break when developing their games, and gives the public an opportunity to contribute to the development by offering feedback.

Yes, there are abuses. But let's be real here, there's abuses of the same caliber at the AAA level. Just look at the Sim City fiasco. EA released the game broken, half-heartedly patched it, then abandoned it altogether. Same with Battlefield 4.

/u/anonpothead, your issue seems to be less with Early Access games and more with shitty developers. The solution to the problem isn't eliminating Early Access, it's all about knowing where to put your money. 

Read reviews, read development blogs, read patch notes. Early Access comes with the added expectation of the consumer to know at least a *little* bit about the theory of the development cycle, and a little about the game's development cycle. If you, the consumer, fail to inform yourself about the dev and the game, then that's on you."

When you add people into the mix, I'm not very competitive, and almost too humble with my wins. It's my personality, and just simply who I am. Mind you, I'd prefer to take my aggression out in a game instead of trolling, but I can see how that would be hard to do for some people, and at times, standing up for yourself can be just as mean-spirited as the initial attack.

So for me, I find myself trying to look at things from the other person's perspective, or simply killing them with kindness (so-to-speak) by not trying to attack their weakness (IRL), though you're correct: I've been trained to find them.

I think it's a personal choice, a decision, and no matter how often you try to take a stand, someone will be there to knock you down. And it isn't just women - the entire LGBT spectrum is often in the same boat as straight female gamers, dare I say it's even worse for them by far in a lot of environments both IRL and online.

I remember my editor (female) getting kinda angry with me and calling me a misogynist for my [#1reasonwhy](http://gamerliving.net/2012/12/13/1reasonwhy-we-are-putting-ourselves-in-a-gender-role/) article. But I really do believe that women *and* men are the reason we're only taking baby steps in the right direction. There are some feminists in the gaming community I don't agree with because, frankly, they make ""us"" look like total nitwits, and are just adding more fodder to the discrimination beast.

Think about gaming ten years ago and how women were treated (for those of us who remember lol). There has *definitely* been a mentality shift in the community, even if it's not yet reaching everyone. I guess what I'm trying to say that I agree bullying is not the answer, but there are ways we can still stand together and change the gamer world.

When I finished High School I didn't know what I was doing, so I spent 4 months as a fulltime rower before getting a job offer and have been working full time as a contractor in a bank (finance industry exp and contracting exp is a good boost for a young person). I got lucky with finding a good job, and have been able to plan a trip to the US for 5 weeks this April (first time leaving the country in 8 years), have picked up my one true love ice hockey, and joined a whole lot more sports.

I don't regret getting a job at all. Sure, my high school mates are all a year ahead of me at uni, but I see them nearly every day for lunch and work just a 10 minute walk from campus. Opportunities come when you least expect them, so do what you want to do and enjoy a gap year should you choose to take one. :)"

Debatable, but even if true he shouldn't have to be. He didn't know the plays that well and Mushin Muhammad was consistently telling him where to line up. His four years as our #1, Forte was our best weapon. Hester was not a #1 WR, he could have been a decent 3 or slot guy perhaps, but relying on him for the #1 possessions was not smart.

&gt;You wanted him to stay a CB?

He could have played some WR, just not our #1 guy. In reality I wanted him to be our PR/KR with some offensive snaps. His return production took a huge dip after he moved to WR. Lovie has probably cost him 10 return TD's over the course of his career."

ctesibius,TrueAskReddit,1388955043.0,"If you study constitutions (plural), you know that a constitution specifies the way that the governance of a country, state or polis works. That is its purpose. Yours happens to have the unusual additional feature that it also defines some of your laws protecting individuals - some, but not all. Let me give an example. Roe vs Wade has important implications for the rights of the individual, whichever side of that particular debate you are on. However it is not constitutional law, nor is it statue law - it happens to be case law. Nothing wrong with that, but it serves to illustrate that even under your system rights and protection are not the sole preserve of the constitution.

Now as to ""bizarre"" - this reflects your interest in the constitution of one particular country over a short period. I suggest that you look at other constitutions - perhaps the Laodicaean (Spartan) one, which is one of the strangest, and perhaps some mediaeval Italian city states (don't forget San Marino, since it's still active). Present day France is pretty interesting as well, since its constitution lead to the development of a third branch of the law (administrative, dealing with the relationship between the citizen and the state)."

Just as an example, I'm a Wukong main. He has never once been in the ""meta"" insofar as a common pro pick or frequent soloqueue pick/ban champ, yet maintains a high win rate for a reason. I'm Plat 5 and I have ~80 games with him and, as of right now, a 60% win rate. He's flexible in terms of laning options (Top/Middle/Jungle), and brings AoE CC to team fights, impressive burst and lane bullying, a gap closer, a juke and a skillshot blocker.

nowordsleft,personalfinance,1388955727.0,"BTW, to fully answer your question, here's what i think you should do to reach your goals.  Fully fund a Roth IRA every year.  With the remaining ~1,000/month you should build a small emergency fund of $1-2,000.  Then concentrate on paying off your credit card debt first, then your student loan debt (assuming the CC debt is at a higher interest rate).  Once you've done that, build your emergency fund up to about 3-6 months of expenses, then you can start saving for those goals like buying a car and house.  You should be able to be clear of all your debt in less than a year given the income you said you have.

If your car will die before this time frame, you may want to make saving for it a higher priority, but in the short run it's probably cheaper to fix it than buy a car when you're not financially ready; but I don't know anything about the car."

KosherDill,AskReddit,1388955745.0,"That's just rude. I love cooking and preparing food for people and with RSVPs and all we were expecting about 40 people for something (this was a few years ago). I went out bought the ingredients, prepared them all, bought the booze- the whole bit. We only had about 15 people show up. We encouraged people to take food home but it was just money down the toilet. Of course everyone had some sort of bullshit excuse, I didn't call them on it because I want them to know they are welcome in my house it just makes me think twice about our friendship. 

Now for our BBQ we do the main course - my husband smokes an amazing brisket, a side and dessert. I make enough for about 6 people and ask people to bring their favorite food. Generally people like to do this, they can get creative and they like being part of the process. I also think it gives people something to talk about, ""Wow, who made the______?"" 

I'm also older now (early 30s) so most people understand that throwing a party isn't cheap. I'm also a lot more appreciative of dinners and parties now because of all the parties and dinners we have, Thanksgiving and Easter are very exhausting. I love cooking for them though. "

Sparkade,stunfisk,1388955769.0,"I've never gotten that impression, here's my take on the matter.  
  
First of all, I love Shofu, he's a hilarious guy and I love watching him play because he's such a cheery guy and he doesn't take anything too seriously in his videos. He's cocky sometimes, but then again I've had a 7 bodybag streak before and my head grew three sizes that day before I got wrecked by my own hubris. I wouldn't go so far as to say he's the sole reason, but after hearing TM87, I stopped being a Genwunner and started to IV breedand  EV train Pokémon in my neglected copy of White.  His videos keep us updated and entertained while not being as boring or annoying as many competitive players are. As the most popular trainer on YouTube he has a vast influence on the way people play the game, from other professionals to kids trying to figure out what's changed. I'm glad he's taken the role he has.  
  
That being said, he doesn't play the game like I do. He bought four copies of X/Y, and had a 5IV OU team ready in what, 7 days? Me, I play the same way I always did. When I was a kid I had my copy of blue that I'd run through 15-20 times a year because I liked watching my Pokémon grow. A victory wasn't the answer to an equation, it was the result of my love for my Pokémon.  The fact that I can EV train a Pokémon in 30 minutes and level it up to 100 with berry juices bothers me because the magic of watching a Pokémon grow is gone. While I do have an outstanding OU team, I rarely use it because my favorite Pokémon all lurk in NU and RU. (And they completely wreck unsuspecting OU trainers)
  
I view the metagame the same way I view professional sports. When you're a kid on a football team you train, you grow, you celebrate, and you cry with your team, the team you're with most of your career playing.  But the NFL isn't so even a game anymore, it's a business. I've learned a lot about Pokémon from Shofu, and if I ever get to battle him I'll be walking on air for a week, but it'll be with a team of my favorite Pokémon, the ones I chose before I knew anything about tiers or EVs or the metagame.

* The Alchemist- Russian Roulette


Gave this a few listens this week. Really  went under the radar in 2012. IIRC, the album  exclusively used samples from Russian songs. Great instrumentals, and features. 9/10



* J Dilla- Donuts

Classic instrumental album, I'm sure everybody knows about it. 9/10


*The Diary of Alicia Keys- Alicia Keys

Very solid album. Decided to check it out after listening to 2 of the singles on the album, Karma, and You Don't Know My Name, the rest of the album didn't dissapoint. 9/10


* T-Pain- Rappa Ternt Sanga

T-Pain's debut album. In addition to the singles, the rest of the album was pretty good. T-Pain can really sing. Take notes Future. 9.5/10



* Action Bronson &amp; Party Supplies- Blue Chips

After enjoying the sequel I went back to the original to see how it stacked up. While I did like it, I didn't feel that it was quite as good as Blue Chips 2. Kinda like how Terminator 2 was better than the first. 8.5/10


* Mama's Gun- Erykah Badu

A classic. If you haven't heard it I'd definitely pick it up. Nice and relaxing, soulful beats. 10/10

turtlehana,loseit,1388955908.0,"What has been successful for me is pacing myself. 

Last year I stopped drinking caffeine/soda. 

Part way through the year I started reducing my carbs only... though I didn't count my grams. Just getting used to not having them with every meal and being content with not having it was big enough. 

This year I'm lowering my carbs to &gt;30grams a day and counting my calories. (In addition to continuing to not drink caffeine/soda). 

I'm surprised by how little carbs that means because I thought I had reduced enough already. No wonder my glucose levels were still high. 

I decided to watch my calories too. I counted my calories off the diet, I was feeling guilty so didn't eat as much, and I had 1878 calories, 200grams carbs, and 89grams sugar. My goal is 1200 calories. 

It has been an adjustment. I have been very grouchy but after 8 days now I'm feeling better. 

Next year I will focus more on exercise. (In addition to continuing 1200 calories and no caffeine/soda). I know if I put to much on my plate at once it'll be overwhelming for me and be a huge adjustment. 

For some people that works but not me. 

Yesterday I had 1055 net calories (1318 calories) went on a walk and burned calories but felt full. 35 grams of carbs and 10 grams of sugar. Pretty close to my goal.

Rinnve,russia,1388956163.0,"In Russia, they don't use the word ""frost"" - mostly because they speak Russian language and not English.

On a more serious note, this is a mild word misuse/misunderstanding. You see, Russian language have different words for weather. For example, there is ""иней"" - that's what you're speaking of, if i'm not mistaken. (Here is a picture of ""иней"": http://900igr.net/photo/priroda/5-JAvlenija-1.files/026-Inej.html) According to dictionaries, ""иней"" is translated as ""hoarfrost"", ""rime"", or (most common) just ""frost"". 

There is another word, ""мороз"", designating freezing weather well below 0C. (It is harder to depict ""мороз"", but this'll do i think: http://hiblogger.net/img/articles_img/0/5/f/1111111-8473s.jpg). And guess what? According to dictionaries, ""мороз"" should be translated as ""frost"".

As such weather is less common for english-speaking countries, I'd guess it is properly designated with some expression, not just a word. But most people tend to use 1-to-1 translations which can be rather imprecise."

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1388956241.0,"Your original assessment is correct; a man's challenge is attracting **any** women. A women's challenge is picking the **one** best man from the collection of possible sexual partners she has, and one is a dramatically harder task than the other.

1) Men's sexual strategy is active. Women's is passive. The passive strategist always has the advantage. This has actually be proven in studies of speed daters.  

2) Far more men find women are sex-worthy than women find men. Most men find most women attractive, where most of women tend to only find 20-40% of men attractive in any given group because women's sexuality is hypergamous. 

3) Women's sexual value is determined at birth. Men's is a direct result of their efforts in life and doesn't usually peak until their mid thirties. "

Jake Adelstein, in his book *Tokyo Vice*, suggests it was such mobsters who killed famed director Itami Juzo -- who had made multiple films exposing common mob tricks of the trade and was planning to make another -- and made it look like a suicide. 

One giveaway was a computer-printed suicide note with the director's signature at the bottom. Another: The note claimed the director was despondent over his extramarital affair coming to light, but in actuality, the affair had come to light at least a year prior.

Rangeland managers often refer to this as an “**invasion**” 

**2011 the USGS Study:**
http://www.edwardsaquifer.net/pdf/brush_mgt_report_2011.pdf

&gt; In 1991 in the Seco Creek watershed near Hondo involved looking at the effects of removing Ashe juniper.  Eighty percent of the cedar canopy was removed from an eight acre tract, and flows from a nearby spring increased 20%.   In a soil water balance study, all regrowth cedar was removed from rangeland in a 40 acre watershed.  Three years of data showed an average increase in water yield of around 35,000 gallons per acre per year.  The increase in water yield was significant, but it declined over time as grasses and other plants became established where the cedar had been.  This suggested that cutting cedar could indeed help increase infiltration of water and increase local springflows where springs already exist, but long-term maintenance would certainly also be required.

&gt; As Juniperus ashei and other woody plants increase in size and abundance in a site, they reduce the habitat available for herbaceous species that cannot live under woody plant canopies.  They also increase the fragmentation of the habitat for these herbaceous species.  Karen Alofs studied the effects of habitat fragmentation on these species. She found that fragmentation reduces native species richness but may also block the spread of B. ischaemum. "

No one's making a stink about it. I've asked him once about it in two weeks and other than that I'm not saying a thing. I thought I'd gauge how some other players feel about the situation to pass some time until the niner game. Why are you so angry and insulting? I guess this issue strikes home for you somehow or something...

I'm sorry if people have skipped out on your leagues before or other bad issues with bad people but thats not going on here. This guy (commish) is a great friend of mine and that'd never change over something like fantasy football even if he never paid me.  

You're making an assumption that I'm shady. Sure those people are out there and you don't have to believe me when I say I'd never skip out on them but I'm not dealing with you. You don't know me or my intentions. Please don't insult me and I won't insult you. There's plenty of ways to get your point across without the attacks

It's actually kind of sad that you have to assume everyone in the world is a prick and is only looking to screw others over at any opportunity even their close friends or family. 

I never said, and I never intended to come across as someone who didn't want to pay. I'm strictly talking about timing. You say use something for 5 months without paying like that is an issue. Well the commish in just about every league does just that if you're not using something like leaguesafe but entrusting them with the dues but not many see any sort of issue with that. To me, you're not paying to play, you're paying the winners. As long as the winners get paid when the season ends does it matter if I send my cash in in August or in December?

Jourdin,Dogtraining,1388956704.0,"He disagrees with scientific studies? Ha, good luck convincing him otherwise. I have a few things bookmarked though, lemme dig 'em up...

Alright, [here's an article](http://www.trainingyourdog.ca/pdf/alpha-wolf.pdf) by L. David Mech, who if I am correct is the guy who studied wolves, came up with alpha/dominance pack theory, and then later disproved himself because he realized he was wrong. A great example of a person of science being able to admit they're wrong and find the truth instead of continuing to propagate incorrect information.

[Another article](http://www.trainingyourdog.ca/articles/dominance-theory.html) called ""The Alpha/Dominance Theory Myth.""

[A third article](http://www.trainingyourdog.ca/articles/the-flawed-alpha-wolf-theory.html) from the same website as the 2nd. This one is called ""The Flawed Alpha Wolf Theory.""

[Using 'Dominance' to Explain Dog Behavior is Old Hat](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090521112711.htm), a 2009 article from a website called ScienceDaily.

[The Dominance Controversy](http://drsophiayin.com/philosophy/dominance?/dominance.php), a page on Dr. Sophia Yin's website. This is good because she has a Ph.D. and is an animal behaviorist; anyone who wouldn't consider her a ""valid"" source is delusional.

[Another Dr. Sophia Yin article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sophia-yin/experts-say-dominance-bas_b_204482.html), on HuffPost, about dominance-based training in pop culture.

[A video made by Dr. Yin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVVBGJi5v9s) called ""Dog Training Secrets."" It explains dog training like a dance with a leader and a follower. Really awesome, would definitely recommend this to start with since it's a short video and doesn't require sit-down reading.

Hmm, as far as books go, I would recommend anything by Karen Pryor. I love her. She's been working with animals for longer than my own parents have been alive. [Don't Shoot The Dog!](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Shoot-Dog-Teaching-Training/dp/0553380397/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388956552&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=don%27t+shoot+the+dog) would be my top recommendation. [The Other End of the Leash](http://www.amazon.com/Other-End-Leash-What-Around/dp/034544678X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388956569&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+other+end+of+the+leash) by Patricia McConnell is also a good read for those wishing to understand more about how dog behavior works and how we understand it as humans. [The Culture Clash](http://www.amazon.com/Culture-Clash-Jean-Donaldson/dp/1617811122/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388956592&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+culture+clash) is also amazing; Jean Donaldson has a great, no-nonsense writing style.

If you wanna get super sciencey, recommend anything by or about B.F. Skinner, or of course about Pavlov. I have a book called [Excel-Erated Learning](http://www.amazon.com/Excel-Erated-Learning-Explaining-Plain-English/dp/1888047070/ref=cm_lmf_tit_7), which I would recommend. You can explain to your friend that dogs learn through operant and classical conditioning, not through hierarchy-based abstract behavior performed by humans who think that their dog sees them as another dog. Your friend might also be interested in learning about the four quadrants of operant conditioning; if he's skeptical of positive training because he sees it as some sort of happy-go-lucky rainbows-and-sunshine approach, he might be glad to learn that plenty of highly educated trainers also employ punishment/corrective methods as well (though they are absolutely *not* executed in the way that Millan does things).

I could go on, but I don't want to overwhelm you (if I haven't already, lol!). I find it to be my personal duty to help spread accurate information about dog training and behavior, so please, if you have any more questions please feel free to PM me. I love talking about this stuff.

Finally, you should realize that you ultimately may not be able to change your friend's mind. Old habits die hard, and Cesar Millan fans are about as loyal to him and love him as much as we who know better hate him. I wish you luck, though, and hopefully you can convert your pal! I'm sure his dog will thank you."

The way it works, is that Outlook will look for an embedded profile Picture (as part of Active Directory / Lync etc) If it does not find one it will go to public sources for one based on the name of the From Field.
This can be Linked In and / or Facebook.

(I think the way it works is by looking at your friends first, if you are logged in when it does the first lookup, then doing a search based on your name as a secondary process if the first doesn't work - I could be wrong)

The primary problem is that A.D. is internal users only, so they aren't shared with other people outside your organisation (or who your organisation has a federated trust with) so it can only return images based on LinkedIn or Facebook.
It will only return images of people that aren't set to private as well.

Though ""bi"" isn't really the best term for it, I still associate with that. If I was to come up with something that's better suited, I would say that I am ""pansexual with a leaning to feminine characteristics, even if they are not related to someone of a female gender."" Isn't that a *cough cough* mouthful.

Anyone who isn't straight or homosexual kinda falls into a grey area, as far as most others are concerned.  
Most people, when seeing a couple walking, assume that their orientation is based on the one person they are with:  
M/M = gay  
F/F = gay  
M/F = straight

But any of those couples could be bi, pan, asexual, etc.  
Society has programmed us to think in a duality of sexuality. Even when people talk about being ""bi"" they mean two. Both genders.

nerdscallmegeek,teenagers,1388956837.0,"the big issue with taking a gap year is that a lot of the time that gap year turns into two or three or four gap years if you're not paying attention. 

So if you can do just one year and go right to school then go right ahead. 

But whichever path you choose is up to you. Not your peers. 

If you take a gap year and then decide to simply enter the workforce instead of college then that's as valid of a choice as going straight to college out of university. 

Just because your peers are going to graduate at 21 with bachelors won't make you a failure if you choose to go a different route or go back to school in your late twenties or even thirties. 

It doesn't matter in the end with these arbitrary deadlines to get shit done like graduating, finding a high paying job, buying a house, having kids etc. Do what makes you happy and take as much time as you need to do it.

I think the article does a great job of explaining the issue of men's health in Australia. 

The only problem that I am seeing with the use of this article is that I feel when you say ""The logical solution would be to fund research at more balanced rates"" you are precluding that in order to increase funding for men's health research we must decrease funding for women's health research.

I am not seeing how this is necessary."

Illidan1943,Games,1388957011.0,"&gt; Devil May Cry must have been a hell of a franchise. 

It was, in the genre it was second on sales only to God of War and they aimed completely different audiencies, God of War is an spectacle fighter while DMC focussed on combat

Capcom originally wanted 5 million copies for the game, even though DMC4 sold 2.7 million copies which is incredible high for the genre (most games in the genre barely sell over 1.5 million), then they revised 2 times the expected sales to 2 millions and finally to 1.2 million copies putting it below average sales for the genre and below any entry of the series (the lowest being DMC3 with 1.3 million after the horrible DMC2, though this doesn't count DMC3SE which adds another 1.1 million copies) AND FINALLY THEY LOWERED IT AGAIN to 1.15 million copies 3 months AFTER THE GAME WAS RELEASED

Not only did Capcom lowered expectations a lot but even then they didn't meet them, most DMC fans didn't want the game, Tameen Antonaides did a perfect job alienating fans eventually closing his twitter and dooming his company to create mobile games (which means that fans of Enslaved and Heavenly Sword will never get a sequel) and there are indications that DMC 5 is probably under early development because Itsuno (the designer behind DMC2, 3 and 4) said he's ready for DMC5 a few months ago

DmC was an incredible failed experiment, it never met even the lowest expectations of Capcom, it doomed a company (that was already close to doom and hated the franchise they were working on) and Capcom probably did that because as always they hate anybody that leaves their company and wanted to ruin what Kamiya did originally with DMC1

Sources (I can't find the original news where Capcom said they wanted 5 million copies but you can find fans mocking them for lowering sales 3 times):

They didn't have the biggest bra, or most curves, and while my friends were not as enamored as I was, they did comment on the fact that these ladies had something about them that made them look good. 

I've also talked to girls I didn't find attractive when I met (school projects, etc) but after a few conversations and learning about them they were all I could think about. They had a nice confidence, no attitude, and were good at what they did or at least put in the effort to be better. 

Just remember that you can't win everyone over, and as long as you are comfortable with yourself you will win the right people over. The clothes or make up you're wearing won't necessarily scare off or attract certain people so wear what you're comfortable with and don't be afraid to push the boundaries a little bit at a time.

Have you see how wild animals mate? It's no different than anything I've seen between a human and animal. Have you seen how artificial insemination works with large animals such as horses and cows? They stick their whole arms into the animals... but when the human gets sexual arousal out of it then all of a sudden it becomes evil rape...

Of course if a grown man has sex with a chicken that's obviously rape due to the size difference causing inherent harm to the animal. But that's just plain animal abuse. There's a big difference between bestiality and animal abuse/rape."

red_one2012,AskWomen,1388957369.0,"My best friend does a similar thing where she asks a lot of questions because she wants to show interest, but I find it incredibly frustrating to have a conversation with her sometimes because everything seems to turn into an interrogation. 

For instance, I wanted to tell a story about a friend who just got engaged and before I can go into any detail she'll have asked me 5 questions about stuff that I don't have the answer to. Frequently I end up abandoning the original conversation because I've said ""I don't know"" too many times. "

screenmagnet,sex,1388957374.0,"It completely depends. For a standard session, he waits until I come twice, and then he fucks me hard and fast for a while just for (my) fun, and then when I've had enough I tell him he can come. How long this lasts depends mostly on how long it takes me to come the first and second time. On average, I would say it probably lasts  about 10-20 minutes of thrusting.

Of course, we also have quickies sometimes (5 minutes of thrusting), and then we have the all-night marathon sex sessions, in which we basically do PIV until both of us are too chafed and sore to continue. I think the longest non-stop thrusting I've had  was about 2-3 hours."

I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell. They did a promo screening at the art theater where I worked at the time. Tucker Max was there and everything! I didn't meet him, but I got a free I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell t-shirt. It was super comfy but I always felt like, if I was going to wear it, I should wear it inside out."
