OHotDawnThisIsMyJawn,AdviceAnimals,1388724688.0,"You seem to be using gender &amp; sex relatively interchangeably when they are not the same thing at all.  You talk about chromosomes and sex organs but neither of those things have to do with gender.  

You can be XY with fully functioning male sex organs and no anomalous hormonal imbalance but still identify as a female gender.  Gender is what your brain feels.  Many people try to get their sex to match their gender but not all.

Lucky Robot has calorie counts for almost everything they have, Mr. Natural is healthy but can be high calorie, Mother's cafe-Bouldin-Steeping Room all have really really healthy and low calorie options. Kerby can be trickier but they have low calorie salads. Austin Java has a really good veggie burger and Casa de Luz is super healthy but a little too healthy if you know what I mean.

I wouldn't want to upset or annoy you, so I'd wait until you brought it up in conversation.

Unfortunately, I'm at a loss to give you any examples of how you would go about doing that.

heres what I did

2) I got an email from that dealership that said Retail: $24,790.00 EPrice $21,130.00.  
I saw the price difference and was confused so I went to their website because I assumed they didnt have the car I got a quote for and this was the price for one they had.

3) on their site they only had one GTI listed (as new, no used or CPO) and they said

MSRP:$30,760
Web Special Price:$26,812

so honestly I have no idea whats going on exactly but I have sent them an email asking questions.

neekz0r,explainlikeimfive,1388724835.0,"There is more to it. 

Most DDoS attacks now-a-days work like this:

Bad Dude writes a virus to infect computers on a massive scale. This virus is usually custom and not in AV software's lists. It can be transmitted either by doing active attacks such as open port software exploitation or by a user visiting a malicious page. 

The virus is crafted in such a way as to allow it to phone home on a regular basis and receive commands. It typically does not infect other machines, as that would give it away. Incidentally, the infected computer is known as a zombie.

So, when Bad Dude wants to launch an attack, he has whatever the computers are connecting notify the zombies to do an attack. That attack could be something like ""ping this IP address"" to ""open this port on this computer"". Because of the sheer number of zombies, this overloads the servers. Usually because they aren't acting like a typical user would.

tl;dr: Computer gets infected and becomes a zombie. Joins a legion of other zombies. Those zombies gang up and attack. "

What that means, is that she finds him less attractive than the other option.

Call a spade a spade, brother. She may find him attractive enough to bang, but if she still finds the other guy even more attractive AND she hasn't gotten over him, like you said, it was over before it began.

But, not for anything more complicated than ""she liked one guy more than the other.""

I mean, we keep preaching to everyone here that we shouldn't put women on a pedestal or cultivate oneitis, and yet for some reason the idea that a woman can be attracted to more than one man and make decisions based on the levels of that attraction is still so foreign and scary?

99 percent of the time, attraction trumps everything. Reasons are only there to explain the obvious - that a woman, if given a choice, will never choose the less attractive option.

Hopefully, neither would the man."

I don't have to be the one to give it to her if she has to take things in hand to help along, but I lose interest if I can't give her as much pleasure as she is giving me (or more, because I'm cocky like that).  I understand that women ""don't need to cum"" to enjoy sex, but I need her to cum for ME to enjoy it.  Otherwise lets just cuddle.

But *man*, did this one vet give me a ton of shit. My cat's barely a year old, and she's telling me I'm pretty much about to kill him. He's a huge tom cat, 16 pounds and solidly built now. He was 21 lbs at that checkup, so he was obese. Not hideously -- it's not like he was immobile or something. But the shit she gave me, I may as well have been lighting him on fire right in front of her.

Then she wanted to sell me expensive diet food. So she goes from ""you're killing your cat"" to ""buy my shit"" in 20 seconds flat. So I know something's up.

I had to walk about 15 blocks in a packed crowd to even get to the street, had to get frisked, have my bags searched. You could hear Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber and see tons of people from the balcony. AND then when the ball dropped it happened so fast and tons of confetti fell. You can see the remnants on the street New Years Day.  Our view was spectacular, as we were 25 stories up right in front of it, but on the ground there's millions of people and I imagine it's really fucking hard to see anything from there.

Consistency is pretty tough at my program too.  We have the same 4 staff, but we work in shifts of two at a time, so I work maybe 3 afternoons a week, and only a few mornings.  The kids respect me, and know I don't mess around, more than the other staff, so on days I'm there they know they can't mess around.  It took a while to get to that point, and a lot of working with their parents and their teachers to let them know that I'll go to any bounds to make sure I follow up on promises, good or bad.

I don't remember if I mentioned this, but try complimenting the kids after the whole ""clap once"" routine.  For example, I'd end up doing the ""clap once"" four or five times (with different variations, my favorite is put your hands on your head, finger on your nose), and as soon as everyone was quiet I'd say ""Billy was the only one that started from the beginning, nice job Billy!

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388725413.0,"&gt;I don't necessarily disagree with you here, but don't you think you are attacking a broader post-modernist position here rather than just feminism? 

Sure.  I tend to use feminism as short hand to refer to the whole of the left/liberal array of identity-based moral schema.  Modern feminists are obsessed with intersectionality, which tends to bring issues of race, sexual orientation, and gender identity into the mix. There is tremendous crossover between the different strands of ""anti-straight-white-manism.""  Feminism is simply the most notable, and the only strand with a convenient name.

&gt;I'd say the self-concious adoption of a marginalized identity against dominant discourses (like patriarchy) is more of a post-modern characteristic than a distinctly feminist one though both ideologies have borrowed from one and other. 

At this point, I'm not sure one could really even draw a line separating the two.  But I tend to avoid discussing post-modernism, as from my perspective post-modernism will always and forever be an architectural movement that focused on making buildings that look like things that aren't buildings, and other such design concepts.  To me, a phone shaped like a football is post-modernism.  What you're describing I prefer to identify as post-structuralism.

But yeah, it's all kind of the same big pile of shitty theories.

&gt;That said, can't your framing of 'slave' morals be applied to almost every marginalized group such as gays, racial minorities, and so forth?

Sure, to some extent, though the argument for that those groups are legitimately being marginalized is far, far stronger.  I mean, take gays for example.  Gays are denied marriage benefits, are not protected from housing and employment discrimination in many states, and lack parity of numbers with their oppressors.

Blacks, meanwhile, can point to historical oppression with actual meaningful consequences for modern black families -- generations of wealth transfer from the black community to the white community, first via slavery, later through segregation and Jim Crow,  created intergenerational poverty in the black community, while wealth in the white community grew and was passed down from generation to generation.  The end of segregation allowed black families to begin reliably accumulating wealth for the first time in America history, but still left them far behind whites and struggling to catch up.

Compare that with women.  Women were denied the right to work and accumulate wealth on their own, but this does not lead to inter-generational poverty.  That a woman cannot own property and pass it on to her daughters does not mean that he daughters will be poor, nor does it mean that she is poor.  Remove the limitations that prevent women from inheriting and working, and women aren't left centuries behind men in wealth accumulation.  Wealthy parents are as likely to have sons as daughters.  Women catch up *instantly*, because women were never a separate society.

That's why you can do things like play a game I call ""How Bad Do White Folk Got It?""  This is a game I play with white people who think ""reverse racism"" has made white people an underprivileged class.  Here's how you play:  Choose **any** statistical marker that can be calculated along racial lines.  Now determine if the statistic measures something undesirable or desirable.  If it measures something undesirable, like imprisonment or unemployment, then it's a red statistic.  If it measures something desirable, like college graduation or home ownership, it's a blue statistic.

Here's how you win: You have to find a red statistic where whites have a higher number than blacks, or a blue statistic where blacks have a higher number than whites.  If you find either, you win!

I'll warn you: I have never lost a game of ""How Bad Have White Folk Got It?""  Because there are no red statistics where blacks aren't higher, and there are no blue statistics where whites are lower.

That indicates there is serious race based oppression and marginalization.  Now try playing the game with women and men.

Imprisonment rates?  Red statistics.  Men higher.  
On the job deaths?  Red statistic. Men higher.  
Victims of violent crime?  Red statistic. Men higher.  
College graduation rates? Blue statistic.  Women higher.  
Average pay? Blue statistic. Men higher. Oh, wait, unless they're in the most common, fastest growing group of Americans -- young, urban professionals.  In which case women are higher.

It's things like that that make me question the reality of women's oppression.  All indicators point to a future where women are more likely to be employed, at higher pay, with better job prospects.  They are less likely to be targets of violence, less likely to be arrested or jailed, and when arrested or jailed will face lighter and shorter sentences.  Really, straight white women are the straight white men of the 21st century.  

Which is why the unceasing cries of ""Boo hoo, poor us!"" coming from the feminists gets more and more ridiculous with each passing year."
frsp,AskReddit,1388725413.0,"It's interesting to note that the number of abortions performed every year in the United States is equal to the number of couples looking to adopt.

&gt;And I think that sometimes it is better to not be born at all than to be born into misery, as some children are.

To say this is to say that the value of human life depends on how comfortable it is, rather than to say that human life is valuable *because* it is human life. Would you say that to [this child](http://johnbarban.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/starving_child.jpg) that his or her life is worthless because he or she is suffering? 

It is a sign of the pervading cultural pestilence: They are suffering, let us kill them. They are poor, let us kill them. They are inconvenient, let us kill them. Rather than recognizing the infinite dignity of the human person, you recognize the material circumstances that can never change their dignity, and rather than seeking to end the social injustices that let this happen, you seek to kill the victim."

In the meantime, dealers will get rich, customers will face minimal repercussions if caught, and the police will spend a lot of time and money arresting a handful of the competition - keeping the market healthy. 

Remember that in the UK your convictions become 'spent' if you're given any sentence less than 2 and half years prison time. Can you even imagine going down for over 2 years for possession of cannabis? I can get stopped by the police up to 3 times before they even have to arrest me.

Marquette King is a phenomenal punter, but Sebastian Janikowski? Sebastian Janikowski is a placeholder. He isn't even a natural punter -- he's a field goal kicker.

I don't see why you're calling every single special teams coordinator in the NFL a bigot. As of now, no one is remotely interested in Kluwe. He is old. He is expensive. He has a previous leg injury. Maybe other teams could find a spot on the roster for him, but for now, he isn't a hot commodity.

I seriously don't understand how you could think Kluwe lost his job solely because he was gay. Do you think that news left ripples in the NFL or something? Ray Lewis was called a murderer by many fans of the NFL and they still let him play up until his retirement. Michael Vick was convicted of dog fighting and he still has a place on the team. Aldon Smith was given a DUI just earlier this year and he wasn't hounded off of the team. Why do you think anyone would give a shit about a gay player? The NFL took part in an [anti-bullying campaign targeted at the gay youth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4glWjcbAbY) No one is avoiding Kluwe because he's a gay. Not many people even cared about it in the first place. The Vikings fans certainly didn't care about it.

Also, just to wrap this up, a high average isn't automatically a good thing, and a low average isn't automatically a bad thing. Average kicking yards only tells you how *far* the kick went, not how the kick turned out. Jon Ryan of the Seattle Seahawks is considered one of the best punters in the NFL even though he has one of the lowest kick averages in the NFL. He's considered one of the best in the business because his kicks have a super long hangtime, so by the time the kick is fielded, the kick returner is already swarmed by the Seahawks special teams. He also has a great ability of kicking punts to within ten yards of the endzone. Up until the very last game of the year, the Seahawks were about to absolutely shatter the record for fewest return yards of the season, but a missed tackle on a single run ruined that record. So like I said, kick return averages aren't always a great gauge of how useful a kicker is to his team."

HexagonStorms,WeAreTheMusicMakers,1388725675.0,"&gt; my friends say that maschine is very restrictive.

Your friends are entitled to their opinion, but you should experiment with Maschine and develop your own as well. I have used Maschine, and I feel that it is powerful as fuck. It comes with everything you need to get started and more. It has its own DAW that works seamlessly with the controller. Not many DAWs have this capability. If you are not a mouse + keyboard guy, Maschine was made for you.

That being said, to create/produce electronic music, you absolutely **NEED** to learn how to use your software. I can guarantee you will continue to struggle at the beginning, but if you stick with it and continue to practice and learn, you will be rewarded.

&gt; I have never played keyboard.

If you are not familiar with the DAW yet, a keyboard would not do you much good anyway. You might be thinking that the MIDI controllers with a keyboard + rotary knobs, pads, and faders may make the DAW less daunting, but you will still be doing plenty of mouse clicking. You can't build a house if you don't know how to use the tools.

&gt; where can I start?

 Learn the DAW. Learn WHY producers use MIDI controllers and how it benefits them. Watch plenty of tutorials. They are your best friend. Then form your own opinion and **EXPERIMENT**. There is a shitload of workflow preferences. Find what works. But do not fucking quit if you're frustrated.

Edit: DAW = Digital audio workstation

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1388725745.0,"Can't agree enough with your point on game (as you say, ""interchangeable with social skills""). It's critical to success everywhere.

Even people doing highly technical work will find that whether they are working as contractors or as FTEs, social skills are critical to landing work. The technical ladder only goes so far. Even in the Silicon Valley, where the technical ladder stretches as far as executive levels, those past level III in their respective fields tend to have significantly better social skills. 

And Silicon Valley, and hell even the US in general, is relatively peculiar on this matter. If you go to other places around the world you'd find that the technical ladder is shorter. A promotion will often pull someone from a technical position and put him in a managerial position that explicitly requires better social skills.

Pomo culture overemphasizes on respecting others and watching where you step, and too many people take that overboard. A beta ""nice guy"" attitude almost never works. Part of being respected is establishing our own boundaries, not just respecting everyone else's. Even going as far as pushing boundaries. That learning process shouldn't be skipped."

dudewiththebling,saplings,1388725955.0,"I live in Vancouver, BC. We have medical marijuana here, so I can get almost any strain, if my dealer is selling it. First, find a little tin that you can use for storage and handbusting (if you don't have a grinder). 

Second, go to a tobacco/head shop and ask for a basic **glass** pipe. There are _ types: spoon (looks like a spoon), sherlock (looks like a hook), chillum (otherwise known as a one hitter, looks like a tube with a narrow bit at the front for the weed), bubbler (has a bowl with a downstem to a chamber containing water), and steamroller (looks like a hollow tube with a bowl on the outside, very harsh and I honestly wouldn't recommend it for a starter). Glass pipes have a hole on the side to allow air after taking a hit. This is known as a carb hole or a choke. If you are right handed, hold the pipe on your left hand and cover the carb hole with your thumb, holding your lighter in your right. The opposite if you are left handed.

Now, when you meet with your dealer, you have 3 types of strains, sativa (energetic and creative, can sometimes make time seem slower, good for playing video games, drawing, etc), indica (relaxing and pain relieving, can sometimes make music sound different, good for watching movies, listening to music, feeding ducks at a park (but feed them bread, not weed), eating, etc), and hybrid (often has a combination of both strains in different proportions). 

Sativa is often referred to as ""skunk"", which some sativa strains are called. Some examples of sativa include Pineapple Skunk, iconic Sour Diesel, world known Green Crack, the sought after Alaskan Thunder Fuck, and Maui Waui.

Indica is often referred to as ""kush"", which some indica strains are called. Some examples of indica include the iconic Purple Kush, well known Northern Lights, Afghan Kush, Silverback Gorilla, Matsu, and Super Kush.

Hybrids are a combination of strains of indicas, sativas, and other hybrids. They are a result of interbreeding and selective plant breeding, allowing growers to ""handcraft"" the effects. Some examples of hybrids include the iconic Blue Dream, Super Lemon Haze, Pineapple Express, XJ-13, Super Skunk, Chernobyl, J1, and Champagne Kush.

Ask your dealer what he has and if he has a variety, decide for yourself. You can expect prices of around $10 a gram. Some dealers charge certain prices for larger amounts. For example, my dealer sells eighth ounces for $25 and quarter ounces for $50.

That's all I got for now, if you want to learn more, leave a comment and I'll get back to you!"

JackPAnderson,Pegging,1388726040.0,"&gt;Her main concern is that she'll be no good at thrusting. We've talked a bit about pegging and she is all for supplying it for me, but I don't know how to tell her that she can't fail me since she is my SO. I think the main hurdle in her thought process is that she has never reversed her role and so she has always been on the receiving end.

My first time being pegged was in the ""cowboy"" position with me riding her. This worked very well because I could control the pace, and it helped me relax. You might want to try that position at first both for the reason I gave and because it would be less outright thrusting action on the part of your SO, which could put her more at ease.

When I was a teen in the 1990s I used to hang out in arcades, and would do my homework in the arcades.  I'm not entirely sure why this is, but I have a theory that goes something like this:  When you get a lot of loud sounds put together, for example the sounds of a busy arcade, it becomes difficult to isolate a single sound.  Not impossible, but difficult.  Thus if you don't focus on the sounds you don't hear a single sound, and without recognition of a single sound to distract you, you can stay focused on your task much as if you had no sound at all.  I believe it's a sensory overwhelming type thing going on here, but again, I'm not sure and this is just a theory/guess."

When the fucking owner has his back on the activism, and the head coach knows that the owner has this player's back on the activism, the head coach would have be be awfully short-sighted to run the guy off of the team because of that activism.

I don't doubt that this shit happened, although I'm not convinced that this Pfeiffer guy was serious when he was saying that stuff.  

Amongst friends, I've said some awfully offensive things as a joke / ribbing / for shock value that would seem to be absolutely damning if one of them went to the press and said ""StraightTalkExpress said such and such with the meanest voice I've ever heard"".  I feel like most of us have made those comments. 

My suspicion is that Kluwe was cut because he was an overpaid punter who was underproducing at that point in his career, and was let go because of it. Also, his position coach liked to bust his balls on a subject that he knew Kluwe was passionate about, in the same way you might tell a vegetarian that you're going to kill six cows later on that night and bathe in their blood."

Yeah, you definitely want to fill them in. Once you find the right color (NYX and Inglot have the more affordable mattes. You might have good luck with an eyebrow kit targeted at blondes though). [This](http://www.thesundaygirl.com/2013/09/the-perfect-eyebrow-kit.html) sort of thing looks good, for example. Or [this](http://www.eyeslipsface.com/studio/eyes/eyebrows/eyebrow_kit) in the ash color.

If you want to get a more defined brow and fill in where there really isn't much to fill in, you often need to use a pencil or gel (in little strokes, to imitate individual pieces of hair, not in big strokes to imitate an eyebrow). 

Powders are nice because if there's even a little bit to fill in, you can just brush powder through your brows with a brush, and it'll look good. It will look rather natural and subtle, rather than fierce and defined, and it's easier to do it well.  

Edit: [Here's](http://samandro.com/2013/05/08/tutorial-eyeshadow-to-fill-in-eyebrows/) a good tutorial, and you can see the difference. You can use a smaller brush rather than a stencil if you feel that you're having trouble with precision, although I guess one is helpful if you're trying to figure out a good shape."
chriswen,litecoinmining,1388726285.0,"So, the altcoin market is always changing.  Most of the profits actually come from the new altcoins (note dogecoin) than reputable stuff like litecoins.

So how much experience do you have in this area?  You're sort of like a hedge fund manager (well you want full transparency).  But for maximum profits you'll have to make risky maneuvers.  And of course we'll be paying you for making good and fast transactions.

Another key part to profit is the exchanging.  Sometimes you'll need to make manual exchanges, peer to peer.  Sometimes you need to get it to the exchange as quick as possible.  Sometimes you need to wait because its tanking (but will it ever recover?).  Sometimes you'll need to wait because its rising (more profit is better)."

frsp,AskReddit,1388726290.0,"&gt;  Do you really think Planned Parenthood is still a eugenicist organization?

I would venture to say that, even if the organization itself is not explicitly eugenicist anymore the pro-abortion culture is eugenicist. It says to the child with Downs: You are disabled, you do not matter, we will kill you.


&gt;Also, your argument assumes that personhood begins at the moment of conception, which is the main premise that separates pro-choicers and pro-lifers.

Is not the fully-grown human genetically identical to his newly conceived self? It is one and the same person, merely taking different forms throughout its life. The standards of personhood advocated by pro-abortionists can be used to argue that infants, mentally disabled persons, the elderly, and the comatose are not persons either and should be exterminated, but very few will take their reasoning to its logical end.

&gt;Can the act of terminating a newly-formed conglomerate of cells (i.e. an early-term abortion) really be equated to ""dismembering an unborn child?""

When I do tell them, I stay positive and brief. They may ask questions and I will answer them, but I don't want to throw the whole book or all my pain at them right away. If they are curious or seem concerned, you can give more details, but try to keep it as upbeat as possible. No one wants to hear all your pains and woes on a date. Instead, they want the shortest version of the truth so that they can decide if it's something they're willing to deal with or not. And some people won't be able to deal with it and that's *okay*. There's plenty of fish in the sea. 

With a more visible illness, it would probably be a good idea to mention it casually at some point during the messaging/talking (pre-date) phase or even put a bit about it on your profile and certainly give a brief and positive explanation on the first date (I have X, it makes me X, I manage it by X, etc.) That way, there are no big surprises for either party and everything's out in the open."

xthorgoldx,AskReddit,1388726568.0,"Except that's **not how radiation works.** It's also not how nuclear plants work.

So, if you're meaning that the water evaporating will result in the fuel rods being exposed, that's just... wrong. Nuclear plants are fail-*safe.* As in, when they fail, they fail in a manner that they are safe, as opposed to fail-dangerous, like a bomb which, when it fails, still poses an active risk of harm. First of all, the water will never ""evaporate"" from the coolant lines - in a pressurized system (nuclear subs), the water is in a closed loop, like a bottle. Not going anywhere. In an open system, the system is, well, *open.* Water flows in, absorbs heat, and moves out - even in pool designs you have water flowing in and out of the system. If a nuclear plant was to be compromised, the water control systems would *default* to maintaining the plant's cooling systems - which would be irrelevant because you'd also see failsafes come into play that neutralize the reaction entirely (control rod deployment, fuel removal, etc - you don't need to cool a reaction that isn't happening).

So then you have non-escalating fuel rods sitting around, being radioactive, in chambers that are designed to absorb their radioactive products until they're destroyed by outside forces. Again: fail**safe**.

As for water?

1. When exposed to alpha radiation (fast travelling helium atom), water undergoes radiolysis, splitting into hydrogen peroxide (H^(2)O^(2)), hydrogen radicals, and ozone (O^(3)), as well as a deenergized helium atom. None of the resultant products are radioactive, and the only danger comes from the risk of something triggering an ozone-to-oxygen reaction which is very, very energetic - but doesn't happen under normal conditions

2. When exposed to beta radiation (fast moving neutron), water absorbs the neutron harmlessly and becomes ""heavy"" water (H2^(2)O), also known as deuterium oxide. Heavy water acts and reacts almost identically to regular water, with the exception of its increased mass. It's not radioactive, occurs naturally (~1/2,000 atoms of water), and is actually essential for proper functioning of a nuclear plant's cooling system - while regular water can catch neutron radiation, thus acting as a neutron buffer (and scaling down any nuclear reaction), heavy water doesn't stop neutrons (it absorbs them, becomes unstable, and re-emits them) and is used to scale up nuclear reactions while still retaining the thermodynamic properties of water.

3. When exposed to gamma radiation, water molecules become more energetic, and either undergoes radiolysis (same effect as alpha radiation) or stays energized and emits lower-wavelength radiation. Gamma radiation, in terms of molecular physics, is the least threatening of all types of radiation because it doesn't *change* other atoms on the scale that the mass-carrying alpha and beta types do (an extra neutron, or an extra two neutrons and protons, can screw up atomic stability). So, nothing there.

So, what's the point of all that? **Water isn't radioactive, and never will be under our current understanding of physics.**

""B-b-but Fukushima!""

Water can *carry* radioactive material, just like fallout can. Radioactive fallout is just dirt that is carrying bits of radioactive material from the bomb - the dirt itself isn't radioactive - it's just a few metals and transition elements - it's just an aerosolizing agent for the stuff that is radioactive, like strontium-90 and caesium-137. In the case of water, this means carrying along radioactive particles like, say, plutonium dust from a recently exploded reactor. 

This isn't an issue for nuclear reactor coolant water, because most nuclear fuels aren't soluble in water *or* the plant is specifically designed to isolate the cooling system that directly interacts with the reactor from a larger coolant line (pressurized water reactor, mostly used in subs). When you hear about ""contaminated water"" from a nuclear accident, it's because it's been contaminated with nuclear materials, not because the water itself is radioactive. Even *then,* your supposed scenario in which the coolant pools evaporate wouldn't result in a catastrophic radiation leak, because the water would evaporate and leave the nuclear materials behind - unless you're heating the coolant pool to several thousand degrees, heavy metals don't evaporate.

Water is such a good radiation shield that you can *literally* go swimming in a pool of nuclear coolant with zero risk of irradiation. Don't believe me? [Randall Munroe got asked this question, too, and he can illustrate better than I can.](http://what-if.xkcd.com/29/) If you were in a pool of spent nuclear fuel (aka, very, very radioactive), as long as the pool was deep enough to let you stay 25 centimeters away from the fuel rods you'd actually receive *less* of a radiation dose than you'd get from walking down the street - the water absorbs all the radiation from the fuel rods after 20 cm or so, and then it absorbs all the background radiation you'd normally be getting from mundane stuff like concrete, ozone, sunlight, etc because you're submerged.

**tl;dr: Screw that, the reason people are scared of nuclear power and the radiation boogeyman is because they don't do their friggin' research. Read the entire thing.**"

misterwhippy,dogecoinbeg,1388726606.0,"Okay, so each water molecule has a partial negatively charged end and a partial positively charged end.  Because of this dipolar trait, water molecules are attracted to each other (positive ends are attracted to negative ends).  this property is called cohesion.  Also, most surfaces have some type of partial charge, either negative or positive, so water likes to stick to these surfaces too, which we call adhesion.  

In the video, the water is sticking to the screen, demonstrating adhesion, and the reason it isn't coming through the tiny spaces is because the water molecules are cohesive with each other.  The force of their attraction to each other and to the screen is enough to hold themselves up against gravity.  Hope that explains it for you :)

iIsMe95,falloutequestria,1388726643.0,"Well then, let's address these things then...

Dash-Do-Well made a whole lot of sense.  Part of PH is filling in little gaps and shining lights on the shadows left from the original.  Rainbow is the only mare who's fate is left a mystery.  Including her in the story only seems logical.

The Legate (He'd probably kill you for addressing him as the Caesar.  He is simply the Caesar's tool,) was NOT god-like.  He was a skilled fighter.  His fighting style revolved around moving fast and hitting hard, which is the base of many real martial arts.  Once Blackjack get's her hooves around him however, she won.  The only thing that saved the Legate was Lancer.  A god-like character would not need to be saved.

Now then, Angsticorn Blackjack.  I think this is supposed to be symbolic.  Remember how Doof declared himself the ""god of fucking pain and misery?""  That's what Blackjack is now.  Her personal pain and misery drove her to a point of power most ponies could only dream of, and she hates it.  That said, she still isn't god-like.  Her new augments drain power like a mother-bucker, which provides good balance.

And all of that aside, even if that all was cliche and predictable, what about the psychology of it?  Ask someone with a false preconceived notion of them self.  Will ANYTHING make them give it up?  Jesus himself could tell you that you aren't what you think, and you'd still believe you are.  Somber always put a lot into the psychology.  Doing what you said would seem like a throw away."
MoKix,AskMen,1388726646.0,"Thanks. I've also gotten a few confused or surprised stares myself when I stutter.

I've been out of speech therapy for about seven years now but it helped immensely when I was younger. I couldn't even start a sentence because I couldn't let the sound of the words out! I usually try to think of what I want to say before I speak and speak slowly. If I still stutter, stop and start the phrase again. For me, it will be certain words that for some reason I won't be able to speak so I try to find another word like it.

I don't know the dynamics of your relationship, but I think being clear that you understand that she's upset (and that it's okay to be upset sometimes) might help to defuse the situation.

&gt;What is the Arizona minimum wage for employees who receive tips? 

&gt;For an employee who customarily and regularly receives tips or gratuities, an employer may pay a wage up to $3.00 per hour less than the minimum wage. This means that an employer must pay not less than $4.80 per hour in direct wages for a tipped employee.

The pressure is a cultural one. It's not rooted in rationality because culture doesn't emerge rationally. If you look for the valid reason behind everything that's expected of you you're gonna find that plenty of things in culture don't make sense. Like, why do you hold the door open for a total stranger, and why is it considered rude not to? No good reason really, since rationally there's no good reason to be polite to a stranger you'll never interact with again. So the question is not 'what's the good reason?', the question is really more like 'am I glad that this is part of our culture or should it be changed?'.

RichardBehiel,technology,1388727103.0,"In training I was told that the maximum recommended ascent speed is 60ft/min (1ft/s), which I assumed was a little lower than the actual speed you could go and still be relatively okay.  Better safe than sorry, right?

Anyways, I always prefer to take it nice and slow when I ascend, since I really like that feeling of not being able to see the ocean floor but not really being able to see the surface either.  So my normal routine is to slowly ascend up to a depth of 50ft or so over the course of a couple minutes, chill there for a while and enjoy the vastness of the ocean around me, then slowly make my way up to 25ft and take a three-minute safety stop before surfacing.  

At 3:15 in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-bikt_DQFs#t=195) was when I first noticed my buddy ascending quickly.  Vis was 20-30ft so I knew I had to come up with him or else I'd lose him just like we had previously lost the rest of the group.  At 3:50 you can see him and his flashlights on the surface while I'm waiting about 20ft below as a safety stop (I had just ascended ~70ft in 35s).  

There was not much I could do at that point except to hope for the best, and at around 4:00 I try to make a sound in an attempt to communicate to him that he should come back down to my depth and take a safety stop.  I only have basic open water training so I wasn't entirely sure what to do in this situation, so I guessed that it might not be too late for a safety stop.  Meanwhile I've forgotten about the camera and it's flailing all over the place.  He finally let some air out of his BCD and came down to me at around 4:50, after which we waited a few minutes and headed back up.  

Fortunately we were both okay.  I wouldn't want to have to do that again, but things could have gone much worse."

HikikomoriKruge,AskReddit,1388727112.0,"The first time it happened to me I was a teen sleeping in my basement room. A room I helped construct 2 years before and was very familiar with. I think I hear a louder than normal sound of the house expanding/contracting and barely managed to open my eyes. The room was distorted, like a fun house, but there was nothing fun about it. Then I heard my door creak open. I managed to shift my eyes to see a dark, long and slender hand opening my door followed by the looming shadow figure I now call the ""dark gaint"". Two eyes that shimmered like crystals and no nose or mouth, but It felt like he was grinning malicious. He never opened the door enough to enter. Just stared at me through the open door for soon time. As soon as I regained control I leap out of bed, grabbed the knife on my night stand, turned on the light and slammed the door. That's right, I slammed the OPEN DOOR. For two years that door never opened itself, but for some reason on that night it had. For the next week I locked the door and slept with the lights on.

The only time I was more terrified was a night a few years ago. I had been discharged from the hospital and was still having difficulty breathing. I managed to fall asleep but awoke with additional pressure on my chest. A small dark shape was resting on my chest. The walls were moving - covered with shadows that resembled tentacles and pulsing flesh. I could see the light under my door since my roommates didn't sleep until the sun rose. But without the ability to move or call for help their proximity was irrelevant. About 1.5 meters from the foot of my bed stood the Dark Giant. He was staring at me holding a foil balloon that touched the roof. He slowly drifted towards then around my bed. The balloon made crinkling sounds as it rubbed against the ceiling. When he got half way up the side of my bed he bent down and lifted the dark shape from my chest which allowed me to breathe. His balloon burst and the dark giant and all the other shadows rapidly faded. It took all my strength, mentally and physically to get out of my bed to look around."

The connection point between evolutionary psychology and any direct empirical evidence has to be a good mechanical account. I agree that most mechanical theories of psychology are not that biologically valid, which is *exactly* what makes evolutionary psychology even flimsier in my opinion.

Confer et al. cited Cochran and Harpending's 2009 book as evidence for the interplay between culture and genetics, but from what I know of their anthropology work, they provide interesting hypotheses, not solid scientific evidence. If you know of any solid evidence on an occasion where biological evolution and culture change occur on the same time scale and interact with other, I would very much like to hear about it."

Nightstalker, Dragon Knight, and Kunkka are also tanky and can run mid or lane like Viper.  NS is more aggressive hero-farming (at night), DK is more push oriented and can transition to carry, and Kunkka is fairly teamfighty.

Lol, no i didn't. You're responding with lines like ""PMSing"" and ""bleeding vagina"", its actually hilarious how you resort to playground insults when backed into a corner.

&gt;First of all, there's no way for someone with a functioning brain to actually think that club drinks aren't overpriced. Can't tell if you're American or not, but at all the clubs I've been to, it costs $10-15 dollars for a single drink at a club, whereas you can get a beer at a good bar for about $2-5. So yeah, club drinks are overpriced to the extreme.

If she is comfortable paying that much, then she doesn't find it overpriced. It's a completely relative term.

&gt;Same goes for the ability to have a conversation - you either leave a club with your throat burning, or you just don't talk at all.

Again, that is worth it to some people. The irony of you calling me a solipsist when you cannot comprehend a perspective other than your own is incredibly rich.

&gt;With that said, is it really a ""loaded question"" if all I'm doing is pointing out the obvious?

Yes, your question was the definition of a loaded question. Secondly, what you think is 'obvious' is most definitely not, as much as you wouldn't like to believe that.

&gt;The fact that you've instantly written off RPers as being wrong shows that you are a closed-minded individual, but that's nothing I didn't know already.

Not all belief systems are deserving of respect. RedPillers generally have a victim complex about it, but the truth is that your views are just extremely flawed. I give those views the same disregard i would scientology or fascism.

&gt;You specifically told me that if you stopped replying, it would be because you are bored.

Well...yeah...obviously. Do you expect me to argue with you ad infinitum? I'm sure even you have better things to do than continue an internet argue forever.

&gt;That means that you knew you'd have to stop debating at some point due to that annoying thing I do where I'm always right

Lol, this is just too much.

&gt;but you wanted make sure I didn't leave the debate too self-satisfied once the inevitable happens and you have to quit because you've been wrong about everything ever since we started.

Of course not. With delusion as deeply entrenched as yours, theres no way i could say anything to have you less than extremely satisfied with yourself.

She told my grandmother the only reason my grandfather stayed with her was because they had kids. Said that if she died, she would take care of him a million times better. Accused my grandfather of molesting her when he wouldn't give her money for oxys. She stole all of the drugs prescribed to my grandparents and cause a lot of pain (physical) on them because of it. She would have these insane freak outs then pretend nothing happened and expected everyone to pretend with her. Me and her will never be square. I will never forgive her. She did a lot of things that hurt me, my sisters and my mom but what she did to my grandparents is grounds for execution in my book.

&gt;I think he has some sort of cosmic perception. Time Lords can manipulate time (obviously) and he has been described as ""being able to see the turn of the universe"" and he ""burns at the center of time."" That's really close to what a cosmic being would be like.

Time Lords can't manipulate time. They have advanced time travel and multidimensional space technology which allows them to build things like a T.A.R.D.I.S., and they have amazing bodies which can do things like regenerate and live for centuries, but they're not reality warpers. 

Steven Moffat said this:

&gt;When they made this particular hero, they didn’t give him a gun, they gave him a screwdriver to fix things. They didn’t give him a tank or a warship or an x-wing fighter, they gave him a call box from which you can call for help. And the didn’t give him a superpower or pointy ears or a heat ray, they gave him an extra heart. They gave him two hearts. And that’s an extraordinary thing; there will never come a time when we don’t need a hero like the doctor.

The point of The Doctor isn't that he's super fast, strong, tough, or powerful. It's that he's very, very smart and very, very caring. 

I've consumed a lot of Dr. Who media, but I am by no means an exhaustive expert on the character. If you can provide verification that he has cosmic level powers, like you say, then I'll concede the point. It's par for the course in this subreddit to verify feats performed, not just people saying they (or someone else) can do *x*, *y*, or *z*; and I have yet to see The Doctor accomplish things that someone else comparably smart and caring with access to the same technology as him can do. In fact, the most impressive reality warping that takes place is performed by companions, like Rose/Bad Wolf, rather than The Doctor himself. 

So, please, provide proof for your claim that he is cosmic level. I stand by my assessment that he's a fair contender and could even achieve results with only access to 21st century Earth tech. "

Here's what helped me more than anything: start weight lifting (or a similarly ""macho"" sport ... I also rock climb and that has helped a lot too). When you do an activity in which your body type gives you an advantage, you'll start to feel proud of your body. Let yourself swagger a bit when you feel that pride and then tap into it when you're out in other situations.

As far as posture: shoulders back, eyes forward, lead with your hips. Not in a weird way, but with each step think about your hips being the first part of your torso to get there. 

When your talking to a group: hands on hips is okay as is hands clasped behind your back. 

When you're talking to a person up close: settle back into your hip but don't hunch back, keep your shoulders broad. 

When your talking to someone below you (as in, a table of diners): I'd try deliberately turning to each person and bending over a bit...not condescendingly, but on their level. 

When sitting: I always try to have something in my hands. Flick a pen around, hold a glass or drink, paper clip, hairband...just don't let it be awkward, you OWN that item, fling it around. "

And your edit is 100% wrong. If someone is hurt they will not just plain redshirt, they will medical redshirt, it makes no sense to waste the redshirt because it is the easier one to obtain.

If he really was just under light speed, then he couldn't have evacuated the city in time. At 70 miles each trip, and assuming 1.5 people per trip, light speed would let him evacuate 500k people in a little over 120 seconds. He *can't* have taken two minutes to pull them all out.

See, we don't know much about the House. But what we do know suggest that it constructs its own narrative based on the current MC. When that MC was Navidson, events spiral out of control in just the perfect way to narratively test his character. Tom is killed because Tom is a the most important character to Navidson that can be killed without ruining the narrative cohesion. This either leads to a tragic ending (for a main character that is incapable of obtaining spiritual catharsis) or turns the story into a comedy (referring to the ancient greek kind).

The Joker dies because his catharsis is just as inaccessible as Batman's. And he dies because there are very few things scarier than the Joker's nightmares brought to life."

My experience has been quite positive. I think Wisconsin is really a ""jack of all trades"" school. We're aren't an exceptionally selective private school, but don't think for a second that there aren't kids of Ivy-caliber here. We have *huge* research expenditures in nearly every department (I was able to do research for credit this past semester which was awesome) if that's your thing and several departments that rank top 10 in the nation and world--especially in STEM and business.

If you like arts, Madison has no shortage of that. It's an awesome college town. It's a city of young people that is regularly rated as one of the best cities to live in in the world. If you like sports, our teams compete at the highest level in the Big Ten conference. (Basketball is currently 14-0 and #4 in the country!) Even if you don't care for sports, the games are worth attending for the fanfare.

We have a reputation as a party school, and there is a lot of that. You can partake in if you'd like but will never feel pressured to. You will almost certainly find a group of people who you like to hang out with no matter who you are.

Classes are challenging (this was a wake-up call for me, and I graduated HS with a 4.0 uw) but you learn *a lot* and learn to love what you do.

Madison itself is an awesome city to explore. It's located between two lakes and is [extremely pretty!](http://photos.uc.wisc.edu/photos/6691/original/aerial_downtown_Mad06_1565.jpg?1286779800) There's a ton to do within the city, and you're only a few hours away from either Minneapolis or Chicago if you wanna explore those cities over the weekend or break. Off-campus housing is affordable and accommodating, the girls are hot and the guys deliver... I could go on... :)

Overall, I really like it. If you're in high-school, this will be hard to understand, but I legitimately *can't wait* to get back to school in a few weeks. I'm really looking forward to spring semester in Madison!

If you want more info, talk to me or ask around /r/UWMadison. I've said a mouthful, but I think it would be difficult for *anyone* to have a negative experience here, no matter where your interests lie.  "

enteringxghost,casualiama,1388728302.0,"I have attempted to do so on paper with oil pastels and oil paints for several very important songs and very important people's voices (to me, at least). Frankly, it turns out really shitty, simply because putting in all of the nuances and flits of colors and movement is really difficult and there is no canvas big enough and I'm probably just not talented enough.

I have, however, made one sculpture (it was in high school) of what my band teacher's voice looked like; it's very small and not nearly of the scale I'd like it to be. My biggest dream is to create giant room-size installations of music/voice/sound color sculptures out of painted/unpainted metal and giant swathes of fabric. Someday.

I will hunt around and see if I can find that sculpture and any lingering attempts at drawing what I see for you, if you'd like."

You could even add a follow-up to the raging motorcycle that would be equally hilarious/explanatory. (Because, you know, Mike may not have been on the ground floor over there. Maybe that motorcycle ramped its way all the way to the back, making the original break even more ridiculous that, by chance, our sentient motorcycle happened to see the guy that fucked his wife.)"

animuseternal,Buddhism,1388728316.0,"This is a credible and legit theory and honestly makes the most sense right now (it resolves a lot of problems in the relativity-quantum paradox). The HuffPo article is bollocks though. This does NOT mean that the universe is a simulation. A simulation is not the same thing as a hologram.

Mathematically, what we're seeing essentially is that a lot of our equations resolve more cleanly if we transpose everything down into two dimensions rather than the standard method of measuring. This is true even up to the eleven dimensions we've calculated so far to ""exist"" (going with M-theory, anyway). The math suggests that the universe is projected from two-dimensions (using something like--and I can't recall precisely--a base-12 mathematics system...?) and it is the specific overlay of these projections that constitute the additional dimensions. Beings who perceive in the world through these projected dimensions then come into a conflict when attempting to mathematically deduce the state and nature of reality because we encounter ""distortion"" through the transposition (for instance, measuring a particular mass's gravitational effect on distant objects).

This does *not* mean that the extra dimensions don't exist. It does not mean we live in some crazy simulated reality. It means that our mathematical simulations lend credence to the theory that extra-dimensional space is a consequence of geometric holographic projection of a two-dimensional base universe. It means that the nature of our perception is a distortion of reality, but it does not mean that it isn't there.

tldr; holographic projection and simulation are not the same thing / this has to do with mathematical tranposition"

For awhile I did believe that gender roles were the way to go, and expected. I guess my mind started changing when I started going to a public school for the first time in 10th grade and got involved with a more liberal crowd.

You seem to think patriarchy still exists.  That's cute.  But it does not. and hasn't for many years.  Robin Thicke is not patriarchy.  Nor is Barbie.  Nor is some dumb cop expressing an asinine opinion that is directly counter to his own departments instructions and training.  These are not examples of patriarchy.

Those are windmills.  Defeating Robin Thicke doesn't make the world a safer place for women.  It just makes you kind of a censorious dickhead.

&gt;The core of your argument is that you seem to think that A, if equality is ever achieved feminists will experience some form of mass psychosis rendering them incapable of reacting appropriately to the world they occupy forcing them to adopt absurd caricatures of feminism to continue to fight imagined oppression, 

To be clear, I think this has already happened, as evidence by dozens of universities across the West banning an anti-slut shaming song while insisting its a pro-rape song based on one out of context lyric.

That's not fighting oppression, that's an absurd caricature of someone fighting oppression.

&gt;and B, that we have achieved universal perfect acceptance and equality for all humans. 

We have achieved legal equality for women in the West.  We will **never** achieve universal perfect acceptance and equality for all humans, not unless you kill everyone.  The only state in which all of humanity would be perfectly equally is in death."

It's always been basically a defanged version of AR. 3 choices instead of 1 or repick and no bonus gold, but pretty much the same odds of teams having uneven drafts and players being forced to play heroes they aren't comfortable with.

It's pretty much the perfect mode for new players ready to start the task of gradually building up their familiarity with all of the heroes, so I can't blame Valve for moving it in that direction, especially now that advanced players who want serious games with hero variety/creativity now have CD in addition to RD."

I have problems connecting with people. It became prevalent in college and at my first job. I was the laughing stock at my store. Everyone teased me. Then when I finally quit and got my first ""real"" job I had a coworker approach me to apologize for everyone's behavior, saying that she thought, ""No one took the time to get to know you. They just don't understand who you are"". This same coworker and I would go drinking every weekend and hung out all the time, so maybe that held some weight.

Maybe. That was the only job I had where people were blatantly disrespectful and cruel to me. But it's also something I still frequently think about when I'm feeling particularly disconnected from everyone else.

A needy, non-avoidant guy is not going to magically fake his way into be the guy who can lean against the wall and glance at a chick from across the club then look away expecting her to show interest. By the same token, Mister Distant isn't going to suddenly learn how to roll up into a large social set and own an entire group that he's just met.

When you're coding against a deadline (and you almost always are, in practice), you end up having to compromise on one of the first two, and sacrificing maintainability ends up costing more time down the road, so efficiency generally makes more sense. Consider how many websites include jQuery just for a handful of functions, or in some cases, just to support another plugin: optimized vanilla Javascript is considerably more efficient, but it takes a lot of time to write, especially if you want it to be maintainable."

All of the ingredients in their store brand (whether pre-packaged or fresh) have been heavily researched and tested for the best taste and freshest ingredients from all around the world. There is literally everything there you would look for in a grocery store at a reasonable price. From what I remember they have pizza, subs, chicken wings, chicken fingers, calzones, sushi, indian food, and chinese food. Enormous cheese and beer selections (some of the newer stores actually have pubs). I miss being able to get enough delicious food for an entire week for about $25.

Next time, drop those three tablespoons of butter (and the bud) into about a cup of water when you're done decarbing - it won't hurt anything, and it will keep you from burning the butter. Cook, as normal, for 40 minutes topping off the water if it gets low. 

To get the butter out of the water, let the saucepan cool on the stove and then put it in the refrigerator. Butter will cool and float, clumped together -  making it easy to gather up.

Their real reasoning is that they don't really know how this whole new approach is going to work while maitaining profitability. It's more than just broadcasting it, but entire infrastructures have to be build capable of handling it. From brand management, to ad services that are still profitable. Do advertisers want to advertise the same way online as they do on TV? How much are they willing to pay? What effect will advertising have on their brand? Depending on what they are going for, they may WANT the TV ad more than the streaming ad. how much are they willing to pay? And how is that managed? Do you align the commercials identical to the TV ads? What do you do when some want to, while others don't? Should they include more regional commercials?

A jazz tradition focuses on ear and theory. You listen, you freakin know progressions. You play, you improvise.

A classical tradition focuses on reading and interpretation. You learn repertoire, you learn some complex technique, you memorize. You do some theory.

But there's a huge overlap in the middle. Huge. Huge.

As a beginner, as long as your classical teacher is giving you theory and you are doing some ear work and lots of jazz listening on your own, you are probably fine.

My personal opinion is that the jazz tradition is harder and that a few years of grounding in the classical tradition is probably an asset before switching to a jazz teacher.

But if you are jazz-oriented, you do need to make a transition at some point.

Caveat: I am totally not a student of the jazz tradition.

There is an older idea that Buddhism ""came out"" of Hinduism, but we now know that to be a misconception. The Vedic religions were originating around the same time as Gautama Buddha, but in a much further province/country than his own. Historic records show that he was clearly aware of it when he was teaching, but seems to suggest that there wasn't much contact between the two until he began to travel much more widely. Of the various Indian religions, he had more direct contact with Jains, it seems. Those within the Shakya clan didn't even seem to practice any form of a caste system, so the theory that Buddhism was a response to and criticism of the Vedic caste system starts to fall apart.

So it's very unlikely. Whereas with Yeshua of Nazareth, later titled Jesus Christ, makes zero sense unless he was very clearly a Jew. Yeshua's teachings, even in the historical record, have him claiming to be the Christ (although it's more likely that due to his spiritual beliefs and his teachings, he was not *claiming* to be Christ so much as promising to save the Jewish people from their enslavement through invoking the Christ prophecy ... of course, not saying he didn't also believe it, but.. yeah.. mostly like a ""Me! Follow me and I will be your Superman!"" kind of thing). In any case, Jesus could never have made claim to the title of Christ unless he was already a Jew.

Alternatively, very little makes sense if Siddhartha Gautama came froma  Vedic religion."

I was kinda sad that O'Neill and Sam didn't have any character growth whatsoever. But Tea'lc and more so Daniel changed to drastically, almost to the point where they were completely new characters and unrecognizable when compared to earlier seasons. They changed for the worse but Daniel got the shitty of the stick. Because Shanks quick a year it forced the writers to come up with a silly way for him to exit and an even sillier way to reenter the show. It permanently scarred his story arc and put the character way off course imho. Mayborne, I thought, was a great character. He has great growth and it made sense. It was a logical progression and felt natural. I really loved Mayborne. 


&gt;The system lords were slowly shown to be static, outdated, and inefficient: too focused on infighting to really achieve anything. In the long term, the ones unable to adapt to a changing threat were eliminated. 

I agree with that and its definately what the writers wanted to portray... but only after they defeated Apophis and throw a dozen or so new system lords at us. The writers had to give the humans a chance at winning so the system lords suddenly had many faults and weaknesses that made them easily defeatable. After Apophis first death, I did not get a sense of danger or urgency from any of the other system lords. None of them, including Anubis, seemed as scary or threatening. SG1 never felt in danger. Partly because, like I said, they were taking down a system lord every other episode. But also because the writers watered them down a bit and made SG1 OP. 

&gt;humans were slowly able to make more of an impact in the universe over time.

It wasn't that slow though. A small group of primitive and technologically inferior humans managed to bring down an empire and reshape the universe in 10 years. If it wasn't for deux machina (both in terms them having extreme luck or having a higher species helping them) the humans, for the most part, would never have won a victory. 

&gt;And the Asgard started out seeming omnipotent and turning out to be relatively weak and strained was also excellent in my opinion. 

I agree. It was a mistake they had to fix. It might not have been such a big issue for someone who watched the show episodically for 10 years... but it was for me. I had all 10 seasons in 2 months. So one week the Asgards were gods, next they were helpless fools and then they were dead. "
ToastedOtter,AskReddit,1388729891.0,"The Federal Reserve is nominally part of the government, although it doesn't receive funding from Congress, and it's intended to operate separately from the government (anecdotally, I recall a Fed governor remarking in the news that he was concerned when the then Fed Chairman was seated next to the president at a dinner, because it contradicted the independence of the Fed from the US government).

**Ways the Fed is a private institution:**

It operates using its own funds, separate from general government revenue (though publicly appointed members do have their compensation approved by the government).

Most regional Bank directors are elected by privately operated banks.

The Federal Reserve cannot be audited completely by the government--it does not receive oversight for all of its decisions, including policy decisions.

It is generally intended to operate without political influence, but only in response to the current economic situation.

**Ways the Fed is a public institution:**

Its board of governors, and some regional Bank directors, are appointed by the State (meaning the government, not the individual states of the USA).

In order to determine if your religious actions violate the Establishment Clause, you must apply the Lemon v. Kurtzman ""Lemon Test"".

First Test: *The government's actions must have a secular legislative purpose.*

From the story and the article, he didn't pass new legislation. He just made a declaration. Further, his secular purpose is to bring the community together. His action would pass the first test.

Second Test: *The government's action must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion*

This isn't advancing or inhibiting religion. Since the activity is optional, there will be no noticable effect as a result of this declaration. It passes this test as well.

Third Test: *The government's action must not result in an ""excessive government entanglement"" with religion.*

Neither the state nor the church are benefiting from this action. There's no money exchanging hands. So it would likely pass this test as well.

the_angry_angel,bristol,1388730284.0,"1. Rightmove.co.uk, zoopla.co.uk are the best that I've used in the last few years. You will need to pay agents fees on top. Last few places I've used it's varied, but budget between 1 and 1.5 month of rent for deposit plus 200-400 pounds for the actual agent - some of that may be used as part of your first rent, but it depends on the agent. Depending on when you move may dictate how quick you need to be with making a decision. When I first moved to Bristol I moved in July with no issues. The closer you get towards September the quicker places will go (students and students finishing study who want to stay). I moved at the end of last August and had to go through 2-3 2 bed apartments before I secured one. 
Different places will have different letting terms, but generally it's 12 months and then either rolling or a renegotiation. Most rental agreements I've had there has been a 6 month get out clause.
If you can bunk down at a friends, or a hostel or something before you move, it may pay you to do so. The problem with pictures on rightmove and zoopla are that they aren't always representative of the area.

2. Totterdown, Knowle (not Knowle West), Sandy Park and Saint Anne's are all in &lt; 20 minutes walk of the main train station. They're not in the centre, but are cheaper from my experience (I've lived in Totterdown, Knowle and Sandy Park areas).

3. Can't really comment on that one. Others are better suited probably.

4. If you're moving to the South West of England, you probably want to move to Bristol. It's cheaper than other cities (such as Bath), bigger, has a good nightlife and culture, and is reasonably well connected in terms of trains to other parts of the country.
You probably don't want to move to Bristol if you don't want to move to a city founded on slavery, hate the rain (that's true of most of the UK tbh) or want to cycle - the Bristol roads aren't really designed for both motor vehicles and bicycles and there are only a limited amount of dedicated cycle lanes.

Hope that helps."

specksk,AskReddit,1388730430.0,"I think that trying to device such a system is worthwhile because using race breeds resentment and an us vs them mentality. I am not a white guy, but was at the bad end of a similar affirmative policy in my country(50% of some sectors were denied to me simply because of who I was at birth. Not because of how wealthy my parents were or which school I went to, but because I was born as x). While I saw instances of less fortunate people benefiting from said policies, I also saw instances of undeserving people getting ahead because of it. I can tell you that it definitely caused resentment in myself and my peers when we were young(and also was the source of nasty stereotypes). Reservations based on race also play a part in preserving race consciousness in my country. You will see different segments/races of the population banding together and competing against one another for these reservation benefits. Imagine political parties openly based on race and their leaders condemning each other on a regular basis. This fortunately has not yet happened in the US. That is why I think effort needs to be spent on coming up with a better system and that policies based on race should be done away with as soon as possible.

I don't know what supreme court actions you are talking about. But if the supreme court bans race based policies in campus admissions then I think such a decision will have a net positive effect in the long run. I am pretty sure that colleges will and can come up with an alternative system for identifying disadvantaged people that will be as good if not better than the current one."

rynchpln,AskHistorians,1388730506.0,"Okay this is a difficult question because oral tradition is not clearly defined. There are a lot of possibilities on dating an oral tradition. You could easily place a very late date on oral tradition or continue to claim unending oral tradition in the case of Roman Catholic Church, for example. However, for the sake of simplicity we can focus on the authorship of the New Testament. If books have not been written you have to agree on some form of oral tradition. 

2 Scholars dating Revelation to 100 AD for the last chance of development. D.A. Carson, R.T. France, and G.J. Wenham in New Bible Commentary: 21 Century Edition also J. Ramsey Michaels. [Sauce](http://www.errantskeptics.org/Dating-Revelation.htm).

Now if you are going to say that is the last book and no other sayings attributed to Christ that are found elsewhere than the gospels are of validity. You would expect to see a wave of writings saying that all the valid traditions are now written down. Yet we see continued developments building on the tradition such as in 1st and 2nd Clement or in the Sheperd of Hermes which were nearly included in the Bible and contain new and distinct themes. 

A break down of those will put you at 130-160 AD. With some scholars thinking that 1st and 2nd Clement were using a harmonized version of the gospel which hints at additional development of further written and oral traditions.

That the Shepherd of Hermas was considered authoritative and we have it listed in between Acts of the Apostles (the one in your bible) and the Acts of Paul (a psuedographical work dating to about 160) in Codex Sinaiticus is a significant factor in determining how important and revered these books were in their time. They were published with the Bible in the same manuscript. That is huge. 

Point is lots of oral tradition continued and some of it was written down with an agenda attached. So the earliest you can argue that oral tradition stopped is with Revelation in 90-100 A.D., but that would be a theologically informed decision more than a rationally informed one. Actual organized belief considering the closing of the canon was a much later development. The Gospel of Thomas was the original book listed as having lots of oral tradition at the same time. 
Richard Valantasis writes:

&gt;Assigning a date to the Gospel of Thomas is very complex because it is difficult to know precisely to what a date is being assigned. Scholars have proposed a date as early as AD 40 or as late as AD 140, depending upon whether the Gospel of Thomas is identified with the original core of sayings, or with the author's published text, or with the Greek or Coptic texts, or with parallels in other literature.

If we are going with date of the authors published text Valantasis goes on to put it at 100-110. The latest after is 140 AD. 40 years after the last book that made it into the cannon, but still while there was clearly tradition occurring that was considered orthodox at a later date. The earliest would put it's publishing right in the middle of the oral traditions that made it into written form then into the New Testament. Undeniably it contains parts of what made it into the New Testament, meaning it was in contact with orthodox tradition. So granted the possiblity that it was written earlier than some New Testament books or considering the absence of any literature signaling the end of oral tradition (if building on an later date). Seeing how oral traditions from the era made it into textual form and ultimately into ""orthodox"" bibles at a later date make it easy to argue that the Gospel of Thomas was written in the midst of multiple oral traditions concerning Christ and the Apostles.

TLDR Hard to define oral tradition without theological biases. But yes it is fairly non controversial to say it still continued when the Gospel of Thomas was written.

&gt;They want turn over. 

No, they don't. Turnover is expensive for employers because training costs money, and accidents caused by new employees cost them business. 

&gt;If someone moves on before they need to be fired, then there is no unemployment compensation claim.

If someone moves on, it's because they no longer value the money they are paid more than what they think they are worth. Employers would rather those employees stay. If the employee says they want more money, but they want more than the revenue they bring in, the employer will refuse because it's a bad business move. In that case, the employee should move on. But that **does not** mean employers always want employees to move on. Just the ones who are over-qualified. And because of income and payroll taxes, even without the minimum wage, employers would be paying more than the employee is worth while employees receive less than they are worth because incidence. 

&gt;These are problems that we wish we had, in todays environment people are desperate enough for work that they are willing to work harder, cheaper, just to have a job.

So those people are lucky that someone is willing to employ them. This ""in today's environment"" shit is so unbelievably childish. People today are better off than they've ever been before. Homeless people in the US today are better off than the middle class 100 years ago.

&gt;Working people have to suffer because your business is failing? Fail out of the marketplace already and make way for competent investors, maybe we don't need a 17th sub shop in town?

90% of businesses fail in the first five years, when they are small. If you are advocating that every small business close down when its profits are low or non-existent, then you are advocating for corporatism in which only the already-wealthy investors control the market. You close the door to any sort of competition, and create an even bigger wealth disparity. 

&gt;Not that you have an effective means of gauging the value brought by an employee, 

You're right, I don't. But I'm not the one trying to tell business owners what they ought to be paying people. 

&gt;or would accept the results if they didn't conform to your worldview. 

Wtf does this even mean? What results? What's my worldview? That the people who know best what a business can afford are the people who actually run it? Because that's not a worldview, that's fucking reality.

&gt;A toilet overflows, everyone refuses to deal with it without a raise, you cycle through your entire stock of minimum wage employees and hire a new batch

This doesn't happen. Nobody fires their entire staff over an overflowing toilet. Nobody can hire an entirely new staff and train them in time to stay in business. That you used this as an example is just ridiculous.

&gt;they all balk at the $60 for the days work you are offering to do mortal combat with the shit demon unleashed on your premises; are you just going to leave it there indefinitely? 

The problem you are describing is one in which you call a plumber, soooo all of this is irrelevant anyway.

&gt;What sort of health and safety fines await you? What if customers see that mess and start rumors around town that you are some sort of poopfetisist?

Then you fail for actually having (literally) shitty businesses practices instead of being taxed into bankruptcy? Pretty obvious outcome of consumers voting with their money. I'm surprised even you failed to see it.

&gt;Wut? I understand incidence, but what you just said was complete gibberish.

If you understand the very first thing about incidence then you would know exactly what I was talking about. So, you're either lying or trolling; take your pick.

&gt;We have shit to pay for, try again.

I have no idea how this is even relevant.

&gt;Me: ""Get rid of [sales] taxes and it's win-win for the buyer and seller.""

&gt;I'm a fan of reducing the tax rate on the first 50k of peoples income to zero

That's a nice arbitrary number you threw out there, but I'm not sure what income tax has to do with the producer-consumer relationship...

&gt;and hiking the tax rate on income over a couple of mil to 91%, but thats just me.

....LOL. Thankfully that's just you.

&gt;Who loses when employees are backed into a corner and have no leverage? 

Their leverage is their knowledge of the job that a new employee wouldn't have. It's not much, which is why it doesn't warrant that much pay (assuming it doesn't require higher education, which would increase their leverage).

&gt;Ah, thats right, tax payers have to pick up the tab. 

Economics of taxation lesson #2: Welfare is a subsidy that employers also benefit from. The fact that tax payers pick up the tab IS WHY employers can afford to pay their employees less. If you don't understand that, pick up a fucking book.

&gt;Again, the market has already set the costs; 

The costs are distorted by government intervention. You have no idea what ""the market"" is.

&gt;you're the one who chose to put your business in a location where rent is $1200, those costs are your problem, pay them.

How do you apply this logic only to business owners and not individuals? Is the idea that they are no more responsible for their location than non-business owners such a difficult concept to you that you refuse to even consider it?

&gt;Me: ""At what point do we say it is the fault of the business?""

&gt;Every day, all the time.

Yeah, okay. The business is the only one responsible, even when any profit they would have is taken by the government without option.

But when I go bankrupt because I'm bad at managing my personal finances, that's not my fault. It's the fault of my greedy employer who refused to pay me more than himself.

&gt;If its that close to the edge, its likely to teeter over on its own, stop bailing it out.

$5,000 profit for a small-to-medium business is quite healthy. I don't know what you *expect* them to make, or even who you think is bailing out this type of business in the first place.

&gt;The employee is just following the employers directives, if they wern't, they would be fired, take some personal accountability.

Are we talking about the personal accountability of the guy who made a risky investment and took on all the costs of running a business, or the guy with no education who filled out an application and was lucky to be paid for acquiring human capital?"

For instance, if you drag magic wand there, it'll show 3 ironwood branches, a magic stick, and a recipe.  Then you just click them to buy them rather than going into the shop interface.  There's always a teleport scroll down there too.  Between all that, you really shouldn't have to browse  the shop interface that often."

I too have spent a LOT of time driving at night after long days (military). There's no real advantage to night time in my opinion. Sure, there are less cars to hit you, but I suspect that a very large majority of accidents are single vehicle, which are more likely at night. 

Depending on where you are, wild animals are a bigger threat at night. 

Human nature wants us to sleep at night. There may be fewer vehicles on the road, but they are much more likely to cross the line or fall asleep. 

Drunk drivers increase. 

Depending on location and time of year, ice is more likely at night. 

Depending on familiarity with the area, and location, surprise turns and funky roads can be a problem. 

Honestly, there is no realistic situation where lowering visibility and increasing fatigue can be a good thing.

Kamins0d,uwo,1388730994.0,"This is often because the calendar isn't updated often or in a timely manner. Other frequent reasons are: once a course is put on, it stays on until taking it off, which is the responsibility of the department, not the central office, and the departments are lazy at that sort of housekeeping. In some special cases the professors who taught that course is on sabbatical, and the department doesn't have a professor to cover it without them, or a professor left, and they haven't replaced them yet, but they are hoping too. 

Still, other departments have courses which specifically only run every other year, but they don't have a way to identify that in the calendar, so it just ends up saying its running, even on off years for simplicities sake.

* Birds have an incredibly fast metabolism. They'd probably poop out the rice before it had too much time to expand.

* Birds break apart their foods, because their instinct is to scatter some while they eat to promote regrowth of plants. Bird logic is to chomp down on it with the beak - half stays in the mouth, half goes to the ground. Therefore, they'd be eating rice pieces, which would expand to considerably smaller sizes.

* Food goes into the bird's crop first, where it is partially digested. It would actually help if the rice was a little mushy from expansion, because the crop has an easier time compacting mushy foods."

If the SSD, these don't have the same data behind them about disk failure.  They should work longer, so in principle it won't die and there's no point to using RAID with SSDs here.  You still should make backups.

I'm a bit out of the loop with GPUs, but I think the 760 is completely capable of 1080p gaming. One can always argue a 770 is more future-proof, but really they just keep moving the DirectX standard and then you can't play some new games (Crysis 3 will not run on a DX10 card, eg)."

*You are nowhere* ***near*** *alone*

This is depression. Most people think of depression as super sad. ""Oh this movie is so sad, it's depressing."" But depression is usually an empty feeling. Like there's nothing there. You feel completely disconnected and completely alone. Mine usually happens in episodes.

There are so many people who feel what you feel. I used to get these after I came down from ADHD medication (I still do sometimes, but not nearly enough). But you have a whole network of people who know how you feel. Who *understand* what you feel.

Fun fact: if you were to take the subscribers of /r/depression and put them shoulder to shoulder, you'd *fill several football fields.* And every one of them understand what you feel.

So come on over. It's good to have a shoulder to lean on. And if you ever need to talk, please feel free to PM me."

IndignantChubbs,AdviceAnimals,1388731584.0,"I have as much experience as you in education and it is not slanted towards women. The uneven performance between women and men that shows up in statistics is much more easily attributable to cultural factors than systematic gender bias. 

The legal system one has some validity, though I know not how much. Mothers are generally favored over fathers. That should be reevaluated. 

If you want to talk about specific issues, great. But you don't because you're dogmatic. Telling me to ""educate myself"" assumes that all there is to learn are things that support your position. Telling me to read the headlines is idiotic because the headlines sure as hell do not make your position obviously true -- in fact, my impression is they make your position look silly. And telling me to go look at /r/mensrights is about as credible as a feminist telling you to go read /r/feminism. That's weak as hell. If you want to be persuasive, make a compelling argument; don't tell me to go jump into your hive and see how obviously correct you are. You're entitled to have a viewpoint, but you're not entitled to see the world in black and white.

Basically, I see men's rights as about the equivalent as white power. It's a reaction by the dominant group to the assertion of power by an oppressed group. I find it shameful, regressive, and totally without merit. And ironically, I think at the end of the day it just supports the central thesis of feminism."

GentlemanBAMF,AskReddit,1388731912.0,"match.com. After a swath of dating (~75 dates in 18 months), I set myself up on a final week before my membership expired. I had 6 dates lined up in 4 days, all with women I'd spent at least a week getting to know and mapping out. I didn't have much in the way of expectations at this point. I knew what I liked, what I was looking for and who was worth pursuing, even if just for a bit of play. 

She was date number 2 in the lot. Our communications were notably more perverse than those with the other women from that week, and the previous dating saga in general. She painted a fairly lewd picture, and I was happy to oblige her needs, but not before a real chance to meet. I'd long since stopped relying on profile pictures as any indication of how someone actually looks or dressed, and wouldn't commit to mediocrity or false impressions. I was expecting a one-nighter.

She played her cards well, highlighting her... Ahem, *assets* with her attire. Her voice caught me off guard, it was more playful than I imagined. She had a little smirk and head tilt that immediately put me on my toes. And she saw the effect immediately. We had a lovely three hours of drinks and chats, slept together, and dropped the L-bomb, and have been together since. I cancelled the other dates the next morning.

My 6 month old is in the 95 percentile for height and 96th for weight.  She is ahead in most of her milestones.  In short, she's as healthy as she could be.

However,

(I don't have stats with me, (in bed) so I'm free balling it here just my knowledge.) From what I understand, Canada isn't as diverse as the U.S., so there isn't as many different ethic groups coming into contact with each other. That said, there's less conflict when everyone is the same color and believes the same thing. Less conflicts = less violence. Also, Canada was sparsely populated without many cities, so handguns were kinda unnecessary. That makes gun control easier when demand is lower and not many conciliable weapons exist in the country to begin with. IMO I think Canada's policy on gun control is pretty sound though.

It will be interesting to see what develops as Canada becomes more diverse though."

---------------

Definitely agree with the need for an incentive, and just as well it needs to be clearer which Invasion missions are what mission type, and should incentivize longer play for certain mission types. One way to do this for Wave Defense and Survival would be to set ""Wave/Time Requirements,"" meaning that players must reach a total of X Waves or Time to earn the battle pay. 

**Example:** A Survival mission has a Time Requirement of 30 Minutes. This means that players must log a total of at least 30 Minutes worth of gameplay within that mission while the Invasion/Infestation is active. The progress bar for Battle Pay will count in 5 minute intervals, and can be accrued all at once or in six separate 5 minute play sessions, whichever the user prefers. Other time differentials, like two 15 minute runs, or 10 minutes + 15 minutes + 5 minute (3 separate runs) would also be acceptable, so long as the total is at least 30 minutes."

I'm not going to get into a discussion about the existence or nature of God but I've managed to reconcile secular and spiritual thought within myself. I definitely have a foot in both camps. The only qualifying statement I will make about my spirituality is that I am NOT religious in that I have no governing narratives, texts or places of worship in the traditional sense. I simply believe. That said, I know that the world and the human condition can be enhanced and greatly improved through science and secular intellecutal thought. I appreciate the company of athiests, the work of scientists and the thoughtful and necessary questions of skeptics. I know that their respective value systems may not include a God, but human decency and a goal towards real human advancement is central to their characters. Go Team Secular! I have also experienced inner-peace, deep appreciation for my fellow man and a very awe-inspiring feeling that I am a part of something much greater than myself through my spiritual practice. So, life and the human condition can also be greatly enhanced and improved through spiritual awareness. Go Team Spiritual!  I am completely comfortable with both trains of thought and I don't feel personally conflicted. This may be because I reject religion. I understand the issues people have with it on many fronts and tend to agree with those issues. Ultimately, it's not religion that's even the problem; it's the zealots and fundamentalists who decry any alternative belief systems. "

Blacksheep01,Torontobluejays,1388732336.0,"Here's some of my thoughts, although I don't know if any of these are possible. I am a fan of the partial domed stadiums that Seattle and Arizona have, their roofs close but there is an area all around the stadium of varying heights, that stays open to the elements. This is likely for the health of the grass. Now, I know its too cold in Canada to entertain such an idea but I thought it would be nice if somehow, between the top seats and the dome, glass panels could be added around the entire stadium. This would let in natural light whether its open or closed and help the grass a tiny bit. It would also help with the cement dreariness of the place.

I'm a lifelong American fan within driving distance of Fenway and that place is wonderful, when I first entered the old Skydome, it didn't feel like a baseball stadium, it felt like a convention center for a ComicCon, that is when the roof is closed. When open, the stadium is much better so this is a compromise to have it always a little brighter and open.

Second, I'd like to see the interior undergo a retro change (to a degree) and add some more interesting field dimensions. Brick would be a nice replacement for that awful cement, which is very utilitarian and sad feeling. Would be cool if the outfield walls were angled in different ways instead of perfectly rounded that would give our defenders an advantage. Perhaps one part of the wall could be really tall as well, like left field.

Third, and this one is likely really not possible, it would be cool if they ran with the idea of the open bar in the old windows restaurant and added some kind of grass field area behind the outfield walls that people could sit on with their own chairs and have a bar behind that. 

This is a huge laundry list, some things may not be possible or cost $200 million, but I'd like to see things like this, in addition to real grass. The windows around the top though, are something I am not willing to compromise on, it should be done somehow."

There were good times sure but after a year of fighting and arguing, all I can really remember are the bad times. She broke up with me for a number of reasons that I don't really remember anymore, and for a good while I wanted to get back together. She wasn't having it. Then when I finally started to get over it and accept not having her around anymore she starts talking about getting back together, how she still loves me. We don't see each other often but we still have the same circle of friends, so when I hang out with them, sometimes she'll be there too. I don't plan on getting back with her anymore. New years kind of drove that point home. The whole eczema comment was during a texting argument we were having today where we both said some nasty things to each other, but hers really hit deep. I know that if it weren't for my skin, I'd have no trouble with women at all. It's my Achilles heel for sure.

Time helps. It gets less and less fresh everyday. Also, forgiveness was instrumental in coping. I don't look at myself as the only victim of what occurred. Someone who physically strikes another person likely is victim of something themselves, whether it's a psychiatric problem, or they were abused themselves. I forgive what happened. I will never be friends with him every again, because I do not trust him, and I do not like how he treats people, or his views on things.

Second thing is to forget about the reference.  If the family was horrible, you don't want them speaking to potential clients.

Now you have two options:

You could:

Figure out how much vacation time you have saved up.  

Present the family with your letter of resignation.  It should say ""To (family name),  This letter is to serve as my four week notice of resignation.  I currently have X days of vacation time which I will be utilizing after X date as terminal leave.  Thank you, Your name.""

Keep a copy for yourself.  If they question you simply say ""this is not the environment I wish to work in. I will be finding a better fit elsewhere."". If he explodes calmly answer  ""im sorry bit I do not wish to be spoken to in that way."". If she cries say ""im sorry that this upsets you, but I believe that this is the best thing for everyone.""

But honestly, good luck getting your vacation time unless you lie and say a relative is sick or something. They know full well that it will cost you more than 1200 dollars to take them to court and get your money.  If they're as bad as you say, the money is never going to be yours.  

So I suggest you go into work tomorrow with someone you know, explain that you were assaulted and you have filed a police report and are examining your options.  You will not be returning to work in the future.  Explain that you expect to receive your vacation time in full by the third of next month.  Leave the house.

Maybe they'll send you the vacation time, but I doubt it."

I got pissed off at a lady at the store once because her son, who was around 5, was pointing at the magazines and asking who the people on them were. LIKE A NORMAL CHILD. The woman was talking to who I was assuming was her own mother and they were talking about how this boy needed aderol or something. The kid wasn't hyper at all, just curious.

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388733327.0,"&gt;While your point about the current formulation of most popular feminist discourse - that it becomes less and less useful as society tends towards equality - is quite valid, I'm interested in where you get the idea that society has gotten close enough for that point to be relevantly made. From my personal viewpoint, I don't see that at all, and can think of several anecdotes from the past week that have reminded me of this. I'm sure you could offer me several anecdotes of where women (or even women that are self-proclaimed feminists) have unfairly discriminated against men. I think the difficult part of CMV'ing with an area such as feminism is that claims such as 'equality' or 'inequality' are ultimately subjective formulations. 

By looking at data, not anecdotes.  Anecdotes are misleading, data is revealing.  The data does not suggest that women are in any way marginalized.

For example, none of the data indicates a particular bias against women politicians.  Being a woman, counter-intuitively, actually seems to *increase* the odds of getting elected.  So why aren't women equally represented in politics?  Well, it's because more men run for office than women.  That's it.

You asked ""Why is that?""  I'll tell you why it is.  Because no one tells women every day that they are growing up that they are worthless pieces of shit with no inherent value, and that they damn well better make something of themselves if they want to be respected.  Men get that lesson (if not directly, then by simply observing the unceasing cruelty leveled at unsuccessful, incompetent men aka *losers* (a term almost exclusively applied to men)), and it leads to men being driven to prove themselves.

Women get told they have Girl Power, and that anyone who tells them they aren't perfect just the way they are is just a hater.  Girls don't have to prove themselves.  Patriarchy tells girls that they have inherent value as mothers, feminism tells them they have inherent value as women, and nobody is telling them that they are inherently worthless fucking shits and need to get a fucking jobbity-job if they want anyone to look at them without spitting.  That's why women don't run for office in the numbers that men do.  Women don't have anything to prove, and suggesting that maybe they do will get you yelled at by both the traditionalists and the feminists.  And the people who run for office?  Those are people with something to prove.

Likewise, when you look at things like the gender wage gap, and you start teasing apart the numbers, you start finding interesting things.  Like, for example, professional urban women who entered the workforce in the last ten years -- so women born after 1975 -- out-earn their male peers.  That's actually the majority of women, by the way.  Urban professionals.  Not a whole lot of people seeking non-urban careers.  So in the largest sector of the market, women are outearning men.  But wage gap!!!! WAGE GAP!!!!

One wonders if, in 15 years, when women who started working in the 60s have all retired from the workforce, and taken their sexism induced reduced wages with them, and the gender gap suddenly reverses itself (as it will assuming we do nothing, right around 2025 if my math is right), if the feminists will finally stop complaining.  I personally doubt it.  Women could earn $1.50 to a man's dollar, and feminists would still find it proof of patriarchy afoot.

In fact, if you separate women under 35 out from all women, they are *kicking men's asses*.  They make up the vast majority of middle managers (and thus will eventually make up the majority of managers).  They are less likely to be persecuted by police forces.  They are less likely to be targets of violence.  They are less likely to die on the job, and more likely to live longer and have greater health.

These are not the statistical indicators one would associate with an oppressed people.  Compare whites and black, and whites win *every time*.  Compare men and women, and women tend to edge out slightly over men, and that edge grows the younger the cohort of women you're looking at.  

The 21st century is on path to be the century of the woman, and it raises real questions.  Because a world where women are dominant in every field, where women control the wealth and political power, and where women still insist on seeing themselves as perpetual victims of male power is a world that I would not want to bring a boy into.

&gt;I'm also a little concerned that you focus on tumblr feminism, when that's about as helpful as /r/philosophy is for discussing the pressing philosophical discussions that academics are battling with. 

I'm less interested in the feminism of ivory tower academics, and more interested in the feminism of ordinary people.  How feminism plays out in the real world.

Mostly it seems to play out in the form of teenage girls being selfish, narcisstic bitches full of hatred and contempt for anyone not like them, all justified by a mish-mash of poorly understood and poorly 

I mean, consider this:  /r/ShitRedditSays is the single most prominent feminist subreddit on reddit.  No feminist subreddit comes close to being as well known or playing a major role in the meta-politics of reddit.  And SRSers are some of the shittiest, most hypocritical douchebags to ever walk the information superhighway.

That's modern feminism.  A bunch of eltist fuckwits berating and attacking people for not mindlessly adhering to a jumble of poorly understood and misapplied theories that they can't even agree on.

Or perhaps modern feminism is Anita Sarkesian, a psuedo-feminist con artist who swindled people out of $160 grand so she could prattle on for an hour about how 8-bit video games from thirty years ago totally shaped modern views on gender (totally! for realz!).  Feminists should be *embarassed* by this scammer, who is basically just [Texe Marrs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texe_Marrs) in hoop earrings, seeing Patriarchy where Marrs sees Satanism.

Or perhaps modern feminism is Jezebel, the most popular feminist website, which specializes in churning out circlejerky puff pieces that all sort of dissolve into this never-ending whine."

GentlemanBAMF,AskReddit,1388733345.0,"Day by day. I'm on welbutrin and trazedone. A couple of ideologies I've adopted to help myself.

1) Depression is an illness. I don't mean self-diagnosed mood swings. I mean depression. See a doctor. Get an evaluation. Monitor your moods. An illness is no one's fault, so don't blame yourself, just focus on a treatment plan. Not treating that illness *is* someone's fault.

2) Isolation is your biggest threat. I'm a fairly social person as is, despite my love of video gaming and reading, I flourish in social situations. I have a hard time remembering that when I spend time alone, bailing on plans and avoiding people, be they friends or family. Make firm routines to see the people closest to you, perhaps once a week. It keeps them updated and gives you something to keep you social.

3) A healthy body is a healthy mind, and vice versa. They're symbiotic, and poor treatment of one often adversely affects the other. I'm intimately aware it can be difficult to force yourself to exercise when you just want to curl up and stare at the wall. So don't aim for the gym or something... Buy a dumbbell. Or a treadmill. You can watch TV or read or do what it is you do with a bit of exercise on the side... It makes a huge difference.

Everyone is different, and everyone's prognosis is different, so everyone's treatment is different. But inaction is a crippling and dangerous approach to depression. Get well, however you must."

Even if you had a really good sex education program and parent who lectures lectures and lectures you not to have sex before you're an adult, a teenager whose hormones is raging will always be a hard thing to ignore.

Secondly, make sure you're listening to your doctor and PT. i cannot stress this enough. They know your knee better than you do. That's why they went to school for god knows how many years and you are paying them a butt-ton of money to fix you. Listen to them, and consult them before trying anything new that they havent explicitly told you is okay.

Thirdly, work on your Fakes. It's something thats really simple and you can even do while you're on the CPM in bed! All you need to do is grab a disc, and hold it as if you're throwing (yes, even lying down), and just start snapping your wrist in the throwing motion without actually throwing it. snap it out and then back in. Also work on changing the throw with one hand (i.e. backhand to forehand, forehand to backhand). It's hard, but the more you build up your wrist strength the easier it will become.

you can also do crunches while in your CPM.

But really, don't over exert yourself and above all else LISTEN TO YOUR DOCTORS.

Rape isn't something that happens at random because a woman is dressed a certain way. Yes, every now and again you hear about some crazy guy who hid in the bushes and attacked a jogger. But by a huge margin rape happens within social circles. 

The people who ""blame the victim"" are generally talking about 1 of 2 situations. The first being the girl who goes to a party and drinks herself into a coma. The second being the girl who gets raped by her friend. 

And the girl who gets raped by her friend isn't just attacked out of the blue one day. There is a series of events leading up to it.

It's like getting robbed. The guy who breaks into my house sucks, and should be arrested, and it is totally his fault. But I should probably lock my door right? 

The ""victim blaming"" thing gets blown out of proportion a lot. Yeah, there are total idiots out there who really do blame a woman's manner of dress. Just like those idiot congressmen who think legitimate rape has a defense mechanism. But the meat of the argument is far more rational than that. It basically boils down to; don't put yourself in a dangerous situation. It's not the victims fault they got raped, but steps to avoid it could have been taken."

Ensurdagen,changemyview,1388734007.0,"I think blaming feminism for a lack of equal outcomes is a stretch. Feminism may not be able to push its members into office, but there's nothing about applying the ""feminist"" label to one's self that hinders one's actions. Society as a whole continues to dictate the outcomes of women's lives, and feminism has merely proven powerless. I agree that feminism doesn't do much in the USA anymore, but you are focusing too much on feminism and overvaluing its influence. It doesn't actually have the influence to change the outcomes of peoples' lives, it doesn't change how people act in their everyday lives because it is an academic and political label. It might change their logical viewpoint, or what they talk about, but they aren't going to get inspired by feminism to become a female CEO -- they decide that with personal experience of enjoying leadership, which feminism doesn't change. I don't know how to change the outcomes of people's lives based on their physical characteristics once socially accepted direct oppression is abolished, and feminism doesn't either. Feminism doesn't prevent that change from happening, though.

Feminism hasn't caused much to happen to the sex power balance, it has simply failed. It succeeded in letting the few women who wanna be president run though, it clearly empowers women as much as it can. I think linking feminism to democratic candidate popularity is like linking the repressed sexuality of republicans to their preference for female candidates.

We take great care to stave off death, and growing life expectations reflect this.

How clear can their choices be to them if they're suffering from some sort of degenerative cognition but their bodily functions are fine? Or the reverse and we can compensate for limited mobility? What kind of timeline is there on critical mass of personal suffering, where we finally decide they get to stop the clock?

WaywardMetroid,HaloStory,1388734354.0,"I don't think you understand how this works.

The Spartan IVs aren't only Spartans because they use MJOLNIR. They're Spartans because they're not only augmented with a new version of what every Spartan since ORION got, but they're also trained similarly and chosen with similar, albeit less limiting, factors.

Spartan IVs are the best of the best when it comes to Human military. That is the selection criteria that Avery Johnson Jr. was chosen by, and he was an amazing soldier who saw the beginning of the war and nearly the end. Simply because they have less training *during* their time as a Spartan doesn't mean they aren't trained at all. They have to go through Basic, then training for whatever special operations they joined, then they have to go through their augmentations, which still have fail rates, and then they go through Spartan training. That's probably more training than ODSTs get. They are Spartans through and through, they're just not stoic badass sociopaths.

I think this was done intentionally to show how flawed both humanity and John are. Humanity once kidnapped kids and caused permanent nerve damage to people to get these results, now they're picking the best soldiers to do it by choice.

I also think that the root of the problem is that some of the characters in Spartan Ops weren't the best characters ever written. We only saw a very small glimpse of Majestic Team, with most of the focus being on Thorne (who I actually really liked as a character). And if Crimson Team, which is all kinds of badass according to, you know, Spartan Ops, then I'm not sure what exactly constitutes a Spartan. Seriously, just because you dislike a character or characters doesn't mean they aren't supersoldiers. I thought Palmer was really annoying, but that doesn't mean she's not a Spartan. "

HA, again the joke is on you, because this is what I’m currently orchestrating.
    
At first I told them all to wake up, it was great.  They were disoriented and could hardly walk.  The drugs I gave them did the trick nicely.  I’m as happy as my seven year old on christmas.  I loved it.  I could taste their desperation, their confusion, and finally their blood lust.  First to go was the skitso, he put up little fight sadly.  Second to go was the aforementioned murderer.  The rapist, now a murderer himself, had such a lust for blood.  I’ve never seen someone so thrilled to take bites out of someones neck while wrestling.  That wasn’t even the best part though! When he finished the murderer he asked me for more people to kill.  Such a thrilling conclusion! But, it would be a lot of work to find people for him to kill, and like every great hobby when it becomes something that you’re forced to do it becomes less fun.  So I killed the rapist.  I’m just glad there are people like me in the world to help make sure that our society stays nice and friendly.  I do what the law never could.  Of course the skitso isn’t someone who would be put in jail, but imagine if he reproduced!? That would be sickening, I wouldn’t want my child going to school with his children.   My son is a beautiful boy, I wouldn’t want his mind corrupted by a boy who possibly has schizophrenia.

Almost all of their cities, save for a few in the north, had been leveled by our conventional strikes. If none of their other cities prompted a surrender, why would these two all of a sudden matter? They don't even rank in the highest casualty or destruction scales. 


They wanted to stick to their guns and force a surrender they still had some sway with. Their actions don't match up with the timing of the bomb drops. When Russia invaded, everything changed. Japan hoped Russia would mediate discussions with the US. When Stalin invaded, that option went down the tube.

Recognizing that the war was totally lost, their interests turned domestic. The high powers had been lying about the war. Germany had just gone through war crimes trials. Their interests were focused on survival. Blaming surrender on this ""incredible new weapon"" gave them an out with their people. And it sat wonderfully with the US. We had a war ending weapon. "

I've run into lots of situations where someone does something like tell a rape joke to a rape survivor, and when the rape survivor asks them to knock it off the joke-teller tries to argue their way out of it. Not everything is grounds for a ""logical"" argument; sometimes, when someone tells you something feels shitty, the appropriate response is to say ""sorry, didn't realize"" and to stop making them feel shitty."

danny_fiasco,polyamory,1388734854.0,"Okay, why I got into it.

I have always been attracted to more than one woman at a time. I'm okay with just being friends with pretty much every single one of them, but I would meet one every now and then that made it very hard to maintain monogamy. I often failed. I loved who I was with at the time, very much, or I wouldn't have been with them. I also cared for the other people, or I wouldn't have involved myself with them. The trouble was, due to the constraints of monogamy, and the fact that my relationship was supposed to be monogamous, trust was broken.

Enter me getting married. I had learned a lot at this point, notably how to just be friends with women that weren't my girlfriend/wife at that point. Then, a few years later, I reconnect with an old friend, and boom! Problem! Its like I hadn't learned anything at all. I could feel myself losing my supposed grip on monogamy. My wife knew that I had struggled in the past to keep my friends as friends, and not more, so it wasn't the first time the subject of extra-marital relationships had come up.

In any event, we decided that my wife would be okay with it if we tried, and my old friend becomes my girlfriend, and now my wife and my girlfriend are my best friends. 

I no longer struggle with myself fighting something that comes naturally to me, and I've got two women in my life who make me the happiest I've ever been. "

My guess is that you are fairly young, under 35 at least, because older people are more able to see sex as a side dish in their convictions. I'm young myself, and it has motivated radical and uncomfortable personal change for years.

A human being is more than the people it knows and the shit it accumulates. In fact, society valuing a human for their wealth or relations over their being makes it clear that they themselves are not great. Many great people in history were of average intelligence, prone to unstable temperament, and sexless. Many boring ass people are rich and/or covered in equally boring women.

As I am thinking about him because of the slave morality post, Friedrich Nietzsche's legacy will live on far longer than the happy rich guy with women on his dick over in LA. Nietzsche was sad, angry, lonely, and not a king. If Nietzsche had decided to off himself before he wrote his books, he would have been forgotten by history and philosophy wouldn't be the same. Nietzsche, of course, is an extreme example, but one's legacy can be overwhelmingly positive despite emotional, fiscal, and sexual failures. There is no clear reason to value the death of the sexless over allowing them a chance to contribute to reality."

Gilt gets criticism because companies sometimes do runs of items specially for Gilt that are lower quality (like Naked &amp; Famous jeans that aren't selvage), and their original prices are often pretty fictional.  It really helps if you have familiarity with what you're buying.  They're all pretty terrible at giving accurate measurements or useful info about a product. (like a $300 belt where the only info about it is ""leather.""  you think someone might want a little more info about, say, what *kind* of leather before they drop $300 on a belt?)  Avoid stuff that you can't return unless you're really, really sure it'll fit right.

I'll also add that you should avoid the whole ""oh i must grab this now it's only available today!"" instinct.  It wouldn't hurt to just watch the sites while buying absolutely nothing for a month or two so that you can get an idea of what stuff they stock.

The one that really surprised me, however, was a lobbyist. You can major in social work and become a lobbyist for related issues. Also, there are all of the usual ""helping"" types of jobs, like therapy (which can cover a huge spectrum of issues), or you can work with a specific age group, like older adults or foster care/adoption with younger children, you can work in human resources doing something (not really sure what, but my mom's friend has her MSW and works for some company's human resources department), non-profit work, and so much more. 
Basically, you can do anything that will help people with a social work degree. Only downside is that you really need your masters do anything.
I'm really bad at explaining all of this, so here's a link to NASW's website with some options by category. http://careers.socialworkers.org/explore/choose.asp

I love my social work classes, although most of them focus on counseling/therapy settings. I do wish they would discuss other points of view/job options. They do get more specific as you get to higher level courses, but (at least at my school) you have to apply to the school of social work.

It would bolster the case of people *who don't like the way they are*, with all the more reason to erase the most hurtful memories.

But, if it's more harmful than even *I'd* tolerate, what if the memory *of the pain associated* with the bad memory gets erased? We still remember what happened, remember the lessons learned, but not feel the pain and suffering because we don't remember how to feel the pain and suffering.

And what if we remove the memory of the *ability to feel pain &amp; suffering* from our lives overall? Then could we still have lessons learned, but have cheerier lives?

&gt;Agree in words, but not in action.  Simply affirm whatever doubt she voices as if you are going to do what she says, but go on moving the seduction forward.  “It’s too soon.”  “I agree.”  “Maybe we should slow down.”  “I agree.”  “But we hardly know each other.”  “I agree.”  “OMG, there’s no way I can fit that.”  “I agree.”  This tactic works better if you pull back a little every time she complains.  Let’s say you have a hand on her breast.  If she hits the brakes, you move your hand off and stroke the outside of her leg, then move it back up to her breasts after a minute.  Repeat ad nauseum.  With some girls you will be saying I agree 20 or 30 times before she succumbs.  Patience and persistence are your best allies now.

Should have been 30 then 40 allowing for a first bid that was maybe strategically low and ignoring market realities. 

Now in hindsight it is obvious that in a world where Ozil goes for 42 and that's the ""beggar's price"" we underbid massively.  We spend too much on Good players without putting out the extra dosh for Great players at the moment. That's how we end up with another season of the fucking Wayne Rooney show.

dHarmonie,ChronicPain,1388736077.0,"OH WOW WALL O' TEXT. Sorry, I have many experiences here.

I had a lower back injury as a late teen/ early 20s person. It's scary, but seeing specialists as an adult gets easier. The best thing you can do is to literally prepare for it like you would an interview or class. You only get a limited time with the doctor and it never fails that you forget to mention something important. Sit down before your appointment and write down ALL your symptoms and how you've been treating it as well as a timeline of when your initial injury was in 2008, how it was treated, and try your best to get any of your old images (x-rays, MRIs) sent to the new doctor before your appointment. Write down what medications you've tried and how successful they have been.

Another thing to consider when you go in is what are your goals for treatment? It's one thing to say ""I don't want to be in pain anymore"" but if athletics are important to you or you have a physically demanding lifestyle (bicycle commuter maybe?), mentioning that being active is an essential part of your life is very important because getting a body back to functional can be a different process than getting it back to ""very active."" 

I wish someone had told me before my back injury odyssey is that under-reporting pain will literally hurt you. A 10 does not mean 'worst pain imaginable' or even 'pain so bad you pass out.' If you can briefly explain to your doctor your pain as a number but also what you are either physically capable of doing or what medication you could take and experience significant relief, it makes communicating a completely subjective experience much easier so they can help you more effectively. So as a personal example, I can say ""well when my pain is at a 5, I can take tylenol and still feel pain, but not so much that I have restricted mobility."" I always get super intimidated when I have to ask for painkillers for pain but being honest is again the best policy. Explain you're not sure the protocol for asking about stronger pain relief but you feel like you'd benefit from something more powerful than an over the counter. 

Also the benefit of doing all this now is that if you do end up in physical therapy or visiting another doctor, you don't have to compile everything all over again, everybody gets the same information. **Some doctors won't look at the notes or timelines, some do, but having it written down makes it easier for you to keep track of your treatment as time goes on until you get more comfortable with the process.** 

Other good questions for first appointments include ""are there any symptoms that indicate I need to get urgent treatment?,"" ""What does 'improvement' look like and about how long should I expect it to take?"" (this answer may be 2-4 months) and ""are there any activities or movements that we haven't talked about that I should avoid?"" Once you've gotten your diagnosis and a treatment plan (which may take a few appointments), actually do it. It sucks having to stop every two hours to stretch or lie down on the floor and do glute bridges, but try really really hard to do it. 

**TL;DR**I hope this helps. I've spent the past 5 years learning how to be a better patient and judging from the feedback I've gotten from my doctors is that being prepared for the appointment makes everything easier for both parties.

The game changer was Russia. When they invaded the largely undefended western side, the game was up. The bomb provided a scape goat for the empire domestically, and handed ""war ending power"" over to the US.

Riali,ABraThatFits,1388736261.0,"If you were previously wearing a 36, it's really unlikely that you needed to go up two band sizes.  The old convention of +4 inches on the underbust size makes for a crappy fit.  Probably, the band is too big and riding up in the back, tilting the wires forward to dig in under the cups.  It is not normal or acceptable that a bra should hurt.  If you give us the five measurements [here](http://i.imgur.com/lAWWlll.png) we can help point you towards a better fit.  Also, underwires work best on almost everyone, provided the bra is the right size!

Edit: I've just realized you meant unpadded, not wireless for by ""softcups"".  A non-padded/moulded bra does generally give a better shape and fit, but there are lots of ones out there with a little more substance if you're super uncomfortable, it's just that they're trickier to fit because they have to be so close to the shape of your breast, and breasts come in a wider variety of shapes than bras tend to. Padded (as in, has seams, but padded fabric) is almost always a fairly viable option for everyone, and moulded is harder, but not often impossible.  A good number of ladies do find they prefer the unlined in the end, but it's a personal thing."

The style of their music is so consistent. It's always so mature and put together sounding. My favorite songs of theirs are actually their debut, [Hole in Your Face](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2xDKSELPgo) and their newest single, [New Era](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LF_4uNfcgY). I wrote [this long comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpopslumberparty/comments/1qy3vz/what_are_your_thoughts_on_sexuality_in_kpop/cdhntky) on how great I though the sex positive message of New Era was a while ago, if anyone who missed it would like to read it.

On the topic of the members, there is a special place in my heart of singers who've mastered the art of beautiful high notes and Sanchez is one of three co-kings of that special place. My favorite songs that showcase his voice are his cover of [Nothing Better](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K9u1QF5zzM) and the remake of San-E Break Up Dinner that he did, [Make Up Dinner](https://soundcloud.com/bnmusic2011/2-make-up-dinner).

I can speak for this case. Being a fellow atheist is a plus in my list, but being religious is not at all a deal-breaker as long as I can still manage to intellectually respect her, for which the following must happen:

- She must not be tight-assed, puritan or prudish.
- She must be sex-positive. This is a requirement regardless of religion. (This means we get to fuck way before marriage. I'm not even very interested on marrying in the first place; what's in it for me?)
- She must not be following her religion correctly. (Fortunately, most religious people don't do what their grimoires say.)
- She must not have asinine beliefs I can't possibly refrain from laughing at, such as creation.
- She must not be a bigot or a hater.
- I don't go to church except for important family ceremonies of her relatives and friends (e.g. weddings).
- If things get serious, I'm only having kids with this woman if the kids are not raised religious. She may tell them about her god as much as I'll tell them about Occam's razor and invisible flying green elephants, but the kids shall not go to a religious school, get religious education, go to church or get any sort of religious indoctrination before 18.

Ensurdagen,changemyview,1388736739.0,"The agony of an entire life without sex? If an individual is motivated to obtain sex, it isn't very hard. Prostitution is legal in many places. A relatively small amount of money can be used to avoid a life without sex. You can even date people with the same physical and emotional problems as you, which is considered standard. The ""agony"" you describe changes into lower standards if you let it, abstaining from pornography that depicts photoshopped ladies will probably speed the process up a lot, as will cognitive therapy aimed at avoiding lust for things you can't have. Another option is bettering yourself, which the cognitive therapy could do by accident. You aren't hopeless, you have internet access and you're young.

Everyone has some amount of greatness. Everyone contributes, and making greater contributions is greater. Having sex with a woman contributed to greatness, but not nearly as much as an achievement of merit. Your emotional state has nothing to do with value, just because you feel sad about being a virgin doesn't devalue the lives of all virgins."

A quick win in Japan, the theory went, would provide a foothold (remember Japan had been occupying chunks of China leading up to, and during the war). Everyone knew victory was assured - the US had been firebombing the shit out of Tokyo and elsewhere -  the only questions were how long and who does the ground work (spoiler, it would have been Soviets by a large margin). So the bomb gave Truman a way to win quickly, save a bunch of American lives, and, above all, win the peace aka the China market. We now know it didn't work out according to plan (which is why we invested so much into Japan's reconstruction - to manufacture a strong regional trading partner in lieu of China).TL;DR The USSR was not only a factor, but possibly *the leading* factor in deciding to drop the bombs."

Cautionary tales need an element of the reprimand, even if it's just a simple **""You fucking idiot""** before moving on to the solution.

Beyond the immediate mistake, let's be frank. Abortion is a viable solution to these crises for a reason. A 15 year old girl shouldn't be forced to carry to term just for an adoption if she doesn't want to, and family situation depending, keeping the child might be against a great many peoples' best interests. Hell, the health complications of keeping it either way can be significant. He's hardly ""fucked"", and the same applies for her.

-not masturbating (after doing NoFap for ~2 weeks, my anxiety started to slowly fade away)

JadeTW, there are numerous reasons to choose either an android or an iPhone, and there is often enormous overlap, with the final choice coming down to either personal preference sometimes, or sometimes functionality. 

Android's hugest differentiators from Apple are customizability and device choice. You can customize the hell out of your android, and there is a huge choice in selection of different devices. The top end Android devices have much better specs than the top Apple devices. 

Google owns the Operating System Android. They are the main developers for it, but they also allow a lot of open development by third parties, which Apple does not.

I would consider your examples to be manipulative rather than emotional. I'm thinking more like: 

We had plans and you cancelled them because you had to run last-minute holiday errands. Rather than making up that date, you just let it go. However, you plan a night out with friends that same week. I get upset about it (sacrificing time with me is okay but sacrificing time with them is not?) and you call me crazy. 

Or it's date night and you forget. You volunteer to stay at work late. I ask you about picking up a pizza and you appear to be clueless. You say you had no idea we were getting together, but maybe you'll stop by after you get off work if you have the time. I'm upset because you're offering me twenty minutes of your night when I had thought we would have the whole thing together. You call me crazy. 

Yes, the last guy I dated was incapable of communicating like an adult. I've just seen guys respond to an emotional response that they don't understand as ""bitch is crazy!"" It's not just the last guy I dated and it's not just me. I've seen it on reddit, with friends' relationships, etc. and it's disheartening.

Probably because those stories were already written, and they were written in European countries.

If so, then the answer is that those stories aren't as ubiquitous as the classics that they choose to take to the screen. Children of all cultures grew up with stories of Rapunzel, The Snow Queen, etc. The same can't be said about many stories featuring POC leads.

All strategic options were still alive for Japan post-bomb.

When the soviets attacked both options were knocked out. The soviet army was ready to invade the Japanese homeland. Most of the troops had been positioned to defend an allied invasion from the east. Defending against the US might have been possible, but fighting a 2 front war against both the US and the Soviets was not possible.

Seriously, I'll bet that if every woman who has ever complained on the internet about the lack of women in government went out and ran for office, the ""problem"" would be solved in one election.  Well, that is, if we had a fair election system that actually worked.  I mean, realistically, the biggest impediment to women in office is gerrymandering that has left incumbents almost impossible to unseat.

&gt;Women are quite often represented poorly in the media, usually oversexualized and sometimes only in certain media as sexual interests, and are stripped of their personality.

That's a purely subjective opinion that is extremely vulnerable to confirmation bias.  Everyone is quite often represented poorly in the media.  I'll grant that women are more likely to get cast as eye-candy that fills up space in scene than men, but most male characters are nameless mooks that exist solely to demonstrate how fast the hero's gun can shoot bullets.  So really, it's kind of a wash, if you're being at all objective."

tylerpoppe,TrollYChromosome,1388738278.0,"Well I guess my reasoning behind Troll X and now Troll Y was that weren't they set up as subreddits for women by women and for men by men, respectively, where each gender can be the truly revealing self we are - not this image of who we want to be or who we fake to be in society but the ones behind the mask and the ones that make fun of the images and ideas of genders at the view of society? Isn't this sub supposed to be about wanting to be the little spoon at times, realizing what shark week means..., boyhood desires, and the poking fun at social views we deal with as men - including dreaming to become the he-man type or having to deal with being the he-man type at times for society - but if that is our mascot then are we not already ruining a subreddit by completely changing the formula that makes TrollX so great?

TrollX is my favorite subreddit because its the first time it felt like a gender was speaking from their collective self in an unfiltered and candid way. But if they were to have a mascot that was some skinny chick in a business suit with a cape and pulling apart the buttoned up shirt is a large W - wouldn't that just ruining the idea of their subreddit by giving the wrong message to their fellow sisters - sure it might say women power fuck year, but it wouldn't open the door to poking fun at what is to be a women, in the home, at the workplace and all forms of society.

thingsliveundermybed,AskReddit,1388738310.0,"I think there is an important difference between ""poor"" and ""financially irresponsible"" though. I have a few friends who have kids on low incomes. Most are careful with money, like yourself, and have happy kids. Some work, some have one parent part time and one full time, some are single parents, etc. And they work hard to give their kids a great life. But I also know people who are dreadful with money, have no work ethic, and mooch off of anyone and everyone. For me, having had parents who were awful with money and having spent my childhood and teenage years worried about stuff I should have been too young to care about, it was very hard. If you provide a stable home, like yours, then it's fantastic regardless of income. An unstable home where kids learn that money simply appears sporadically from other people and there is a pervasive sense of uncertainty, is rough for little people. I think that's where the anger at people having kids that they can't afford comes from: if someone's head is too far up their arse for them to work out that three kids might be tricky to feed, it's not exactly an endorsement of their skills in other areas."

Her video series is about women specifically. It's Tropes vs. Women, not Tropes vs. Humanity. I'm sure if someone made one about male tropes in video games, it would be pretty talked-about as well.

The New Year is a big time of goal-setting, but lots of people set those goals in ways that won't stick; Ariely wants to fix that problem."

USA's invasion and conquest of Iraq and eventual discovery that it did not have nuclear weapons is part of that.

Around my 27 birthday I decided to make my plan and leave. I started hiding money, searching for a place to live, making friends online who where helping me, and a week or so before I was set to go, he found out. He tried to kill me, had it planned out to the littlest detail, was going to try to frame one of my new friends, etc. 
As I'm here typing this...he didn't succeed. He went to jail and I got a permentantly restraining order. 2 days later I met the guy who would become the father of my kids. He did the same shit my ex husband did, minus the physical abuse. I stayed with him 6 years. 
You NEED to take time to yourself, no dating, no serious physical contact with someone until you fix you. I took a year of therapy and serious self reflection before I even thought about dating again. I healed myself by relearning I was worth it.

Everyone forgets that Icarus also flew.

It’s the same when love comes to an end,

or the marriage fails and people say

they knew it was a mistake, that everybody

said it would never work. That she was

old enough to know better. But anything

worth doing is worth doing badly.

Like being there by that summer ocean

on the other side of the island while

love was fading out of her, the stars

burning so extravagantly those nights that

anyone could tell you they would never last.

Every morning she was asleep in my bed

like a visitation, the gentleness in her

like antelope standing in the dawn mist.

Each afternoon I watched her coming back

through the hot stony field after swimming,

the sea light behind her and the huge sky

on the other side of that. Listened to her

while we ate lunch. How can they say

the marriage failed? Like the people who

came back from Provence (when it was Provence)

and said it was pretty but the food was greasy.

I believe Icarus was not failing as he fell,

but just coming to the end of his triumph."

I don't believe groups are worse at taking care of things than individuals, I believe that's it's wrong for a group to impose its will on an individual. The question of ""what's best for us,"" doesn't matter. If you have a reef, do what you want with it. Sell tickets, break it up, put a fence around it. I have no right to your reef. I think the big point people miss about libertarianism is the moral aspect. ""The greater good"" does not give you the right to tell me how to live because every single individual has a different concept of ""the greater good."" He begs the question of ""Saving the reef is the best outcome for everyone."" We just don't know that. Maybe the money he makes off hocking the reef goes into cancer funding, and we get a miracle cure. Who knows. Until we can tell the future, the only moral position is to let people do what they want with what is theirs.

Edit: And to go further, even IF we could tell the future, your interpretation of ""good"" and my interpretation of ""good"" might never mesh, therefore I can't support the idea of forcing other people to do what's good, even if I'm positive I know what that is. "

WeaklyDominant,AskReddit,1388739365.0,"The big thing that matters here is having interests and activities that you like to do. For some people, those interests include reading, so hanging out at a location and reading is a great way to meet people with similar interests, while also doing something you love. For other people, though, you might not enjoy hanging out at a library, and you might not want the types of partners who enjoy that either.

So, if you're having a hard time meeting people, the solution is probably to get involved in some new activities/groups, especially if you're interested in meeting people outside of your social circle (which I'm assuming, since you mention *meeting* girls/guys). You could also ask around your friends if they know people with whom you might click, but those are naturally going to be fewer in number than the people you'll meet by getting out there and exploring a bit.

That's true, but applying the label isn't what I'm talking about.  I mean embracing feminist philosophy.  It's disempowering.  I'll show you what I mean.  Do you know how I know that you are a feminist?  It's because you said this:

&gt;Society as a whole continues to dictate the outcomes of women's lives, and feminism has merely proven powerless.

This right here, this whole statement is 100% complete BS.  Society is not a person, it does not have thoughts or goals or desires, and it cannot take action.  It does not act as a whole, and is absolutely incapable of doing what you just suggested.  What you are doing is called *reification*, ascribing human like attributes to a concept or construction.  In this case, society.

There are two possible options that you can choose from, two different beliefs:

A) Society dictates what I do.

B) I dictate what I do.

One of these ideas is empowering.  One of them is disempowering. Guess which one you just endorsed!

&gt;Feminism doesn't prevent that change from happening, though.

Yeah, actually, it does.  It takes young women who are reaching the age where they will decide their futures and choose their destinies, and telling them ""You're fucked, the whole system is rigged against you, the world is made for you to fail, so don't even try. The only thing you can do is scream at the world how oppressed you are!""

Okay, that's a red herring and it doesn't even matter, but putting that aside, how do you know that? Where's your link, or can I at least know your source of information? Like I already said in another post to you, I shouldn't even have to ask for this. Back up what you say. You have no inherent credibility on the internet.

Second, the second, fourth, and fifth claim *aren't even contradictions of what the movie said.* The fourth one, for example, is basically you just reiterating exactly what the film said. The second one is again pretty much exactly what the movie said, NOT a contradiction.

The first claim is just dumb. The movie was filled with people who have worked with/studied whales as their careers. I don't see how that's even disputable.

The third one is hard to understand. Unless you're saying the trainer who witnessed what took place is just flat out lying (and if you are, you need evidence), what you're saying doesn't even make sense. There was one incident, not multiple ones, that was being discussed, and the trainer witnessed the entire event. 

Your last claim is pretty much the only one that is even worth reading, and that one you just copied and pasted from Wikipedia.

There was Dragon Warrior I-IV, followed by Dragon Warrior VII, followed by... drumroll Dragon Quest VIII. Where the fuck did 'Quest' come from? (rhetorical question)

This is pretty ignorant, the name was always ""Dragon Quest"" in Japan but it had to be changed in the US for legal reasons (another game had that title already)

&gt;And all of the Dragon Quest/Warrior Western ports came years after the Japanese releases, and unlike the Final Fantasy series, they felt like ports.

The NDS ports/remakes were better than the originals. 

&gt;There's also the question of the visual theme and simplistic combat for the series as a whole, which Westerners never really appreciated. But that's a separate discussion.

Don't you label me. ""Feminist"" is a label that wastes breath. It's insignificant in more egalitarian cultures and its members cannot accept this. Their wasted breath isn't why they aren't running for president, though. They are just as likely to waste time watching crappy TV or working in a restaurant.

&gt; Society as a whole continues to dictate the outcomes of women's lives

Everyone's lives* a truism really.

&gt; One of these ideas is empowering. One of them is disempowering. Guess which one you just endorsed!

One of these ideas is accurate. I grew up and then started experiencing attraction to certain behaviors based on the way society shaped me. I didn't decide to be who I am, this is merely an illusion people create to find comfort in control. Psychology shows that genetics and upbringing effect the emotional state and personality of a person, feminism as a viewpoint does nothing to override this. You need to prove that the feminist viewpoint has clear psychological effects on everyone that harbors it if your statements are to hold true.

&gt; Yeah, actually, it does.

If you keep making baseless claims and speculating, you're the first world feminist of this conversation. The burden of proof is on you here, but since you haven't presented your evidence yet you obviously have none. You aren't Fromm, you don't get to psychoanalyze dead Hitler and be lauded for it.

flashmedallion,assassinscreed,1388739953.0,"Excellent response, thanks.  I agree with a lot of what you said in the broad sense, but I think you are misrepresenting the Assassins goals.  I'll try to explain.

First, just quickly:

&gt; I feel like if people didn't fight the Templars motives, they wouldn't need to enslave people.

I have to disagree on this point for a couple of reasons;  The Templars are interested in pacifying the entire human race - regardless of their affiliation or any history of ""poor behaviour"".  So it's got nothing to do with anyone fighting back, for a start.

On the other side of that coin, if in fact everyone *was* fighting back, isn't that basically saying the Templars take issue with human nature?  They themselves say the same thing - the problem is that the Templars *also* have that same human nature and there are very imperfect expressions of their goals throughout history.  Al Mualim and Vidic are a couple of good examples there.  

So either way you cut it, there's too much at stake in letting some people rule the others under the pretence that they have their egos in check.

On Assassins:

&gt;People, as much as they don't think so, need order. If no one had to do anything, nothing would get done.

I think Black Flag goes to great pains to point out that the Assassins goals are not equivalent to a free-for-all anarchy.  There's a deliberate contrast drawn between the Pirate Republic (anarchy) and the Assassins Creed.  Also, do not fall into the trap of assuming that the Assassins oppose ""order"".  The Templars use the word ""order"" to couch their mindset (fascism) in a positive light and their propaganda states that Assassins oppose ""order"", but this has never been an Assassin priority.  

The Assassins oppose power structures that enslave - enslave meaning to impose one persons will over many.  In a word, that can be summarised as ""freedom"" but it's reductive and misleading to assert that particular definition of Freedom as meaning ""anyone can do what they like"".  That's not what the Assassins stand for at all.

In a nutshell, freedom from enslavement is not mutually exclusive with various power structures or different implementations of ""Order"".  It *is* mutually exclusive with the Templars power structure, and reducing the Assassins to being ""opposed to order"" is mere rhetoric and propaganda from the Templars."

CHAPTER 17: STARTS OFF STRONG WITH THE WORST PART OF THIS GAME, A FLASHBACK.

Ugggggh we get it you used to be friends, a long time ago, you used to be friends. Why doesn't the game show us these people Lyon cured? It'd be more effective at showing he had good intentions I think.

Oh my god Frelia why is your military so bad. Did you send all your good units and Moulder and Gilliam with me? I'm gonna be working on EphraimxTana and EwanxRoss on this map cause I want them up at A by 19. Lute and Artur are sitting out because of how overlevelled they are compared to everyone else. Ewan's gonna be providing my magic support this map. I'm gonna ignore that dracoshield the beserker is carrying because I can't find room for Rennac to come.

Cormag busts down the snag to the north and Amelia and Franz head up there to deal with the units there. Joshua and Marisa are going to deal with the heroes and get me my brave axe - gerik will love that. Meanwhile everyone else just pushes the middle, with Tana and Vanessa flying ahead to recruit Syrene - maybe I'll even triangle attack someone this level, first time for everything.

Marisa and Joshua actually have a lot of trouble with the sword-wielding heros - guess I misjudged Marisa's dodginess without her Gerik support. I end up drawing them across the river and camping on the forests. The wonder twins start pushing through the druids around Lyon, being careful not to draw the ire of the killing edge swordmaster. 

I realise Tana's almost out of sword so she nicks Franz' sword so she doesn't get to S rank lances - she's like 2 swings of a lance away.

Holy shit. That brave axe son of a bitch just hit Joshua twice on 16% odds. If he does that again Joshua dies. C'mon man act like a swordmaster not a friggin' warrior. They eventually deal with it and grab the axe, then start heading up. Meanwhile some actually threatening reinforcements appear over on the left, so I send Syrene over in case I need to triangle attack. Wonder twins still holding down the fort against the shamans, so I'm looking good.

Uh. Apparently the triangle attack only triggers on the first hit of a double. That's pretty shit, I know it didn't work that way in fe6. Tana lives though, cause Franz snipes the great knight (who survived a hit and a crit from Tana, good on him) with his short spear.

Joshua makes it to the swordmaster with the hoplon guard and then outdamages him with his surprisingly large health pool. Meanwhile Ross - who had swum across the river to cut off a shaman fleeing to the south east fortresses - finds himself face to face with a couple of warriors. Ross calls that a good time, and crits both of their asses for 66 with a fucking iron axe never change. I do end up sending down Joshua Ewan and a couple fliers to help him out though, because his dodge isn't that great and those guys hit like a truck.

Meanwhile I push L'Arachel to level 20 with the barrier staff and she promotes. As for Valkyrie vs Mage Knight - they're basically identical. Lute's already an Anima mage, but she has a side of light. Artur is entirely light magic, while Ewan is focusing on Dark but also has A anima. I end up making her a valkyrie off a coinflip. I then start supporting her and Joshua, because I forgot they got a support and it's not like either of them have better options.

Oh my god TanaxEphraim B is the greatest support. Ewan meanwhile is a total dick head to Ross. Careful mister, he can probably one-shot you with Garm. I send the pegs over to see if I can triangle attack the boss from range but it turns out this game nerfed the hell out of the triangle attack for no good reason. Pretty sure you used to be able to do it from range. I just have Eirika bust out Sieglinde to murder him. Can't get him to switch to Nosferatu though, but no big deal. Then I get Vidofnir and Nidhogg and wow, isn't this awkward. I uh. I don't have any archers this run through. Basically all of my ranged units are mages. I can't even sell the damn thing. So disappointing.

CHAPTER 18: Let's have a long conversation about how Lyon is PERMANENTLY AND IRREVERSIBLY EVIL. Are you fucking listening Eirika? Apparently goddamn not my god this chapter makes me angry.

Not the gameplay though, even though it's really simple. I split everyone up into groups of 2 or 3, point them towards an end of the map, and squish as many fucking eggs as possible, and everyone gets a shitload of levels.

No Eirika please. Don't. Didn't you just. Ugh. I'm pretty sure she doesn't even learn anything from this.

CHAPTER 19: Oh my this map. This map is so much fun. Probably one of the best fog of war maps in the series, honestly.

Alright, the plan. I'm gonna bust out all the fun staffs for this level, and will warp Colm into the left treasure room. Eirika is gonna head to the secret shop and buy me lots of physic staffs with the member and silver cards. Ephraim and Tana will escort Rennac down to the right side treasure and everyone else is going to push hard down and left. Marisa, Gerik, Amelia, and Franz are rocking their A-supports up in the top left and will just generally be unstoppable badasses at the top corridor of the map until it gives up.

I make it down to the main choke point and hope my units dodge a lot. But really, Joshua was sitting at 2 hp then dodged no less than 3 coinflips. I basically can't trust anyone to actually hold that choke point except cormag with the fili shield and guess what: It's 2 spaces wide. As it is I have to spam the silence staff to get the mages to stop killing everyone. Then reinforcements come from the right side and reduce Rennac to 3 hp and poisoned. I decide to rush Riev and murder the hell out of him with Ross, Lute, and Cormag.

That was uh...

That was tough.

I think I'm gonna go grind the tower so everyone's sitting pretty at ~11 promoted. Maybe hand out some stat boosters. Pretty sure I'm gonna use a hammerne charge on the brave lance - Cormag reduced it to like 3 uses counter killing literally everyone please stop killing people Cormag you won't be able to wall anything that way.

Sorry, flashbacks. I grab the staff for L'Arachel and the book for Artur and 100% not the Light Brand, those knights keeled the hell over. 2 of them gave their lives to save Rennac for a turn, and also managed to stop a couple of thieves from bothering him, so we'll hold a military funeral for those two guys.

Say adding the flash increased the price per unit by $5 and costs an extra $5 million in R&amp;D but increases the sales by 25% (which I definitely think it will). If you still sell 1 million units at the same price ($100), the overall profit will be $40.5 million.

EDIT: According to some online research, the lumia 520/521 have sold more than 5 million units. Doing the same calculation above with 5 million units instead of 1 million, the results are:

They have a unique relationship because of this, but they definitely make it work, and I couldn't see my sister or my brother-in-law happier with anyone else.

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1388740534.0,"I was just talking about this here a few days back. I am absolutely convinced most BP guys never had a high SMV. I would even argue it's pretty low. So the world that they experience on the sexual market has been relatively tame, hooking up with equally low people. Even their friends are these weaker lowly valued individuals going through the same struggles. So they, understandably, have a skewed understanding of what relationships should be like.

They don't have many high SMV friends, so they don't even know what that side of life is like. Personally, I got into seduction and quickly found TRP a few months later. The whole reason was because I was getting frustrated with the people around me, and subsiquently all the shitty poon I was getting and the slow lifestyle that came with having a low SMV with friends with equally low SMVs. 

Before this event, I had a higher SMV but stopped caring about myself, and sort of let myself slip into a beta role with arguably pretty lame friends -- I'm still lose friends with many of them, but it's the truth. Before this change, I was fucking 8 and 9s regularly. Before this, a Friday night meant going to a some chicks mansion house while they were pretty much naked taking shots off each other and smoking weed like it never ended. I even managed to pull off a foursome with 3 ridiculously cute chicks one night. Or going to a club taking MDMA with some random hot foriegner who's giving me a blowy in the bathroom. But then what happened to me? Now my Friday nights were hanging out with our small group of friends while we sneak into some college building like bad little rebels and sharing a bottle of booze. It was fucking lame.

Then I found TRP and all this shit just started clicking. It all started making sense. I was thinking, ""Uh huh, yeah, uh huh, YEAH! This all makes sense!"" The reason it resonated with me so well was because I did experience that life and it didn't just feel true, it logically was. From there I stuck with it.

Funny enough, one thing I quickly learned was most people in the middle SMV -- especially females on the lower end -- will reject everything I tried to share philosophically. It would be a strong hamstering rationalization on every end. Which is understandable, they are just trying to justify their less than ideal situation. Meanwhile, the feminist leaning people do see it, but they see it wrongly. They see it as an institutional unfairness where just some people through whatever form of institutional privilege are having all the fun and living the life. So they are vehemently trying to fight against what they falsely see as an malicious attack on their life.

But you know who accepted TRP perfectly well? High SMV people. They will just sort of nod their heads but not talk about it. They know how the game is played. They may not being fully cognitive but they understand it inherently. But you're not supposed to talk about fight club. So it's more of a nod and smile. 

Fuck, I don't even know what I'm talking about any more. But yeah, I do totally agree with you. Which is why I try my best not to talk about these things IRL. It's a fruitless effort. Either people do see it for what it is or they don't. Most people that you want to talk about it with have a skewed perspective of that type of life, so they just simply wont understand. 

EDIT: Reminds me also of how I like going to clubs/bars. I either want to go to a shitty dive club or a really high end club. I don't mean high end in the sense that people pay a lot just for the sake of saying they are at a special high end club (I hate those as well), but high end in the sense that it's filled with honestly wealthy people, trust fund kids, or kids from wealthy families. The middle-class clubs are the worst. Everyone has this different perspective on life. It's the competitive class. Most people at a middle-class club all have something to prove. They are there more for show, and have to be chest thumping and making a point. The proper high end clubs, no one has shit to prove. No one cares. People are more fun, they don't really care what you do, and you can get away with just about anything -- and every one has a high SMV, so while it's a struggle to get a 7 at a normal club, at these places it's way easier to bag an 8. Same goes with the low end clubs. People just don't give a fuck about what people think, so they open up more and do wild shit. The only downside is the low SMV, and the few hotties tend to have a pack of guys always trying to get in them. The high end clubs, doesn't have this supply/demand issue. 

But again, it's perspective. Some people start getting very insecure going into a high end club with low SMV and much rather have the traditional regular club because the traditional rules apply: Women have men buying them tons of drinks and fighting for their attention, while the men can bro it up and pay a fuckton to be a king for the night.

PerfectHair,todayilearned,1388740547.0,"From Wikipedia:

In 1992, Heemeyer bought 2 acres (8,100 m2) of land from the Resolution Trust Corporation, the federal agency organized to handle the assets of failed savings and loan institutions. He bought the land for $42,000 to build a muffler shop and subsequently agreed to sell the land to a concrete company owned by the Docheff family to build a concrete batch plant. The agreed price was $250,000 but according to Susan Docheff, Heemeyer changed his mind and increased the price to $375,000 and later demanded a deal worth approximately $1 million. Some believe this negotiation happened before the rezoning proposal was heard by the town council.[5]

In 2001, the zoning commission and the town's trustees approved the construction of a cement manufacturing plant. Heemeyer appealed the decisions unsuccessfully. For many years, Heemeyer had used the adjacent property as a way to get to his muffler shop. The plan for the cement plant blocked that access. In addition to the frustration engendered by this dispute over access, Heemeyer was fined $2,500 by the Granby government for various violations, including ""junk cars on the property and not being hooked up to the sewer line"".

As a last measure, Heemeyer petitioned the city with his neighbors and friends, but to no avail. He could not function without the sewer line and the cooperation of the town.[6]

I don't know where I read the article, but somewhere someone was sitting in their front yard, the kids were playing in the cul-de-sac, and the cops were called because the parents weren't visible to the neighbors.  I remember watching a Judge Judy or one of those shows, where the parent was being sued by his neighbor for letting the kid play on the sidewalk/alley in front of the house and the kid (about 3 years old) accidentally bumped into the neighbor with a little scooter or something and cut the lady's ankle, with the parent in the yard. Also, the vast amount of sex offenders that seems to be in a very close proximity to my neighborhood (within a couple mile radius), how am I to know which ones are the pedophiles?  I don't like going to parks because when I do go, there are always those older kids that are playing too rough around the younger kids and are not being told anything about it by their parents, or I am trying to get my homework done while my kiddo plays and I am getting bad looks because I am not playing with her, just watching (and policing her behavior).  I have a pool so she can't play in the backyard and my front yard is too small to play very much.  


I am very sorry that those parents who do allow their children to run amok have kind of ruined it for the rest of them, but my baby is well behaved in public (most days) and will sit quietly or play quietly in front of me.  That's good parenting.

gypsyblue,AskReddit,1388740705.0,"It depends on where you are. In British Columbia, we have one of the strictest licencing processes in North America... you have to be 16 to apply for a learner's permit (after passing a written exam with ­&gt;80%), and the learner's stage lasts a full year. Then you're eligible to take a 45-minute road test to become licenced as a ""novice"" driver, where you have to display a green ""N"" magnet on the back of your car, maintain a 0.00 blood alcohol content level, and can never have more than one passenger unless they're a member of your household. After TWO years as a novice, if you had a *spotless* driving record the entire time, you can apply to take *another* 45-minute road test. If you pass that test, you get your full drivers licence and can drive with more than one passenger and with a BAC of up to 0.05. Best case scenario, if you hit all the milestones on your birthday and don't fail a single test (the failure rate for each road test is about 30% in Metro Vancouver) and don't have any accidents or traffic tickets, you'll get your full driver's licence at 19.

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388740964.0,"&gt;Out of mild curiosity are you familiar at all with Foucault's arguments about the repressive hypothesis and MacKinnon and Dworkin and other radical feminists arguments about repression?

Not really.

&gt;They all basically contend that the idea of 'repression' is nonsensical because power fundamentally shapes all our behavior; if we have 'repressed' desires, power also created those desires. 

I did not follow any of that sentence.  I have no idea what any of that means in that combination.

&gt;The contention then is that society conditions women to serve men sexually and that sex is all about male pleasure (sex begins when the men is hard and when he finishes traditionally, if you're interested in the whole structure of this argument you can google for it.)

That seems like a very accurate description of Victorian sexual mores, and a very poor description of modern sexual mores.  ""Everyone"" knows that sex begins with foreplay and ends with cuddling. 

Hell, even the Catholic Church instructs its followers to engage in foreplay and asserts that women have a right to sexual pleasure and orgasm.  **THE CATHOLIC CHURCH**.  Seriously!!!  It's right there in the catechism.

Where's the beef?

I'll help you out: *there were none* 

[Allen: Cap crunch won't force cuts](http://realredskins.com/2013/08/16/allen-cap-crunch-wont-force-cuts/)
&gt; “We’ll keep the best 53 players,” said Allen. “We’ll probably have to renegotiate some contracts and maneuver around it, but we’ll absolutely keep the best 53.”
&gt;
&gt; He also said that effects of the cap penalty will be felt beyond 2013.
&gt; 
&gt; “That salary cap penalty will hurt us for a number of years,” he said. “It’s just not those two years because of the repercussions of it down the road.”

Sure, they didn't get to upgrade the secondary (just like they didn't get to make offensive upgrades they wanted)... but remember, this was *after* the transition period you keep insisting it takes. The offense got better, the defense continued to flounder despite having time to re-tool the defense. They didn't get to upgrade more, but they didn't lose anyone from the roster they built over a couple years of a 3-4 defense.

All you have are unsubstantiated excuses for a terrible defensive coordinator who had his chance **and failed miserably**.

bubbish,AskMen,1388741072.0,"Hi, forget about fitbits, fitocracy, shakeweights and jump ropes with windows phone support. Throw all that shit out the window. I'm serious.

Instead, go to the gym 3 times a week and stick to these basic exercies:

* Bench press
* Military press
* Pullups/pulldowns
* Dips
* Squats (very important!)
* Deadlifts

Study these exercises so that you know how they are done properly, how they work your muscles, different ways of doing them (body weight, dumbbell, barbell etc) and of later importance; how you can vary them. Wherever possible, do these on body weight or free weights - machines are a big no-no in the long run.

These big exercises will expend a lot of energy and boost your big muscles while your smaller muscles piggyback by supporting. Isolation exercises such as bicep curls and leg extensions are great for sculpting and focusing growth, but they are less important in the beginning. Try to avoid using machines.

As for learning, there's an excess of material on the web with details on all exercises. Youtube is a great place for learning proper form which is important both for gains and for avoiding injury. You can also just ask trainers or nice people in the gym. Avoid machines.

As for reps/sets, begin by doing simple 3 sets of 10 reps each, adjusting your weight so that you're feeling it by the 2nd set and you ""fail"" by the end of the 3rd. Failing is good, it's your way of telling the body ""hey dude we need more muscle here next time, chop chop"". You can slowly adjust your weight up as your body gets stronger. After you've got the hang of all the exercises you can move on to more advanced patterns like dropsets, diamond sets etc. Avoid machines.

Please don't forget to take care of your body outside of the gym; tons of water, enough sleep regularly and proper eating (no junk food, regular meal times, plenty of protein, supplements if you like).

That's what I can give you off the top of my head, feel free to PM me for more tips. I'm no expert by any stretch of the imagination but I have good experience - I spent a year working in another city and the gym became my only escape from the lonesome drudgery of hotel room TV. Also, avoid machines."

Freelancer49,Magicdeckbuilding,1388741204.0,"It's just too slow, you've gotta trim some fat and focus on what mono green does best, beating face with undercosted creatures. To that end, I'd do the following:

Remove Rubblebelt Raiders and add Burning-Tree Emissary. Raiders is too slow and the acceleration of Burning-Tree is too good to pass up. 

Remove Plummet and add Elvish Mystic. Plummet is too narrow and should be in your sideboard if anything, mysitc gets you more acceleration which you need. 

Remove Bioshift and add kalonian tusker or Boon Satyr. Bioshift is cute but bodies win games, and either of these undercosted beaters fit that theme. 

Remove Revernt Hunter and add mistcutter hydra or Polukranos, world eater. Both are heavy hitters that make great use of all the mana nykthos can make. You could also drop one or two arbor colossus as well, a full four in here is a bit of stretch. 

Remove temple of abandon and add forests. This deck does not have time to wait for land to untap, you need to be going full steam ahead every turn and you have no need for red mana anyways.

Remember, focus on being fast, mean, and lean. You also may want to find room for one or two more garruks. Being able to refill your hand with garruk is what makes this deck so deadly.

For the most part, you don't.

To the OP: Forget your end goal for now, focus first on learning the basics of coding and wiring. Get an Uno or an equivalent board, get a breadboard, some leds, some buttons, maybe a servo or a few misc detectors, things like light and sound or magnetic fields or whatever.

Experiment with how the things are set up, figure out how to make an LED pulse, figure out how to take the analog input from a light sensor to make a piezo buzz, experiment with reading and writing memory on the EEPROM, figure out how to communicate through the serial port, find out what a transistor is and how it works, etc, etc.

Basically, get the basics, do random tutorials, and just tinker for a while. After that you're going to want to specialize a little bit on servos and communication, hopefully at that point you're going to have the very basics needed to start something like an RC car.

Once you have a functioning RC car you could move on to networking and computer programming. Map the cars movements to whatever software you'd like to write.

A couple more years of tinkering and probably a bit of money invested and you'll at least know whether or not it's something you're interested in doing, and at that point you're in a much better position to ask where you'd start on that project specifically."

In fact, he'd started to say something veering close to my weaknesses, so I curtly countered his point and turned away, thinking I'd successfully brushed him off course. But then he immediately, matter-of-factly countered me with everything, and just laid waste to my fortress, so to speak.

bertrussell,AskScienceDiscussion,1388741982.0,"Since this is AskScienceDiscussion and not AskScience, I will add my view on this subject (of which I am not an expert).

Never discount the placebo effect for things like this, unless you see a very thorough study that accounts for placebo effect. (Hard to do in this case.)

At my work we regularly talk about a study that was done (there is a cancer treatment section at my workplace, which is why it is relevant) with a certain kind of treatment in which the patients were told either:

1. They definitely had the ""medicine"".

2. They had a 75% chance of having the ""medicine"".

3. They had a 50% chance of having the ""medicine"".

4. They had a 25% chance of having the ""medicine"".

5. They definitely had the placebo.

What they found is that the placebo effect was strongest when there was either a 50 or 75% chance of having the ""medicine"". In each case, there was a control group and a medicated group for comparison. I have not personally read the study, though, and I can't find it and link it for you.

In other words, the placebo effect is stronger and different than people necessarily expect. It doesn't just work when people ""think they have the cure but actually don't"". If a woman knows she was given a man's heart, I can imagine that the placebo effect would strongly impact this woman's life in relation to that."

Whenever you feel sad or angry, talk to him about it. You should try to get over blaming him first, so you can start handling it as a team. Just say ""Boyfriend, I'm so angry and I have these thoughts and feelings, do you have any idea how I can feel better?"" and you can talk about it or just cuddle.

Berean_Katz,atheism,1388742279.0,"1) I always loved Bill Nye; he's actually kinda one of my heroes. :D
 
2) People on ""the grapevine"" are saying that debating a creationist gives them credibility, that it puts them on equal footing with scientists. I kinda figured that as well, but it's also worth noting that debating a creationist is EASY. The fact is, it's impossible to ""lose"" to a creationist if you've ever had experience debating whatsoever and understand basic science. Bill Nye is an educator and scientist (not to mention the coolest thing ever: ENGINEER!), so it shouldn't be difficult for him to explain to the layman, which is what Ken Ham *is* in regards to Biology, exactly why creationism isn't accepted in science classrooms and why it isn't science in the first place. Hell, I can even go ahead and explain *why* it isn't science right now, very simply: Science gathers evidence and forms a conclusion based on test-ability, repeat-ability, and following an attempt to falsify results via peer review. Creationism does more-or-less the complete opposite: it forms a conclusion (which, placed at the beginning, would be more like an ""introduction""), then looks around every nook and cranny to find whatever evidence *seems* believable, regardless of whether or not it's actually falsifiable--which it always is as far as I've seen. It's backwards science, and it's something called *leading the evidence* as opposed to *following the evidence*.
 
3) Someone said that ""you can't disprove creationism, therefore it's worthy of the same respect as other ideas."" This is nonsense, because science is based on evidence. If creationism HAD good evidence, then that quote would hold some weight. But it doesn't. Plus, this quote relies on the age-old fallacy of shifting of the burden of proof.

4) All that being said, I'm actually pretty excited to see how it turns out. We have to remember that Bill is not gonna change his mind about his position, nor is Ken. What really matters is the audience. I truly hope that the audience has an open mind (like I did as I tangled with this issue) and finally realize that creationism isn't a viable model of origin.

* 16gb is useless no matter how strong the placebo effect is, unless you edit lots and lots of videos... or something.

* Got you a GTX 780 ti which is a better buy than two 280x

* That case is huge, and you can't fill it up with an ATX motherboard no matter how hard you try. I grabbed you a far better quality case."

ChuckZombie,AskMen,1388742770.0,"I went to New York with my brother and his friend at the beginning of 2012. We each had a different reason for going other than general vacation/tourism. My brother wanted to see a NY Rangers game, his friend wanted to go to a Knicks game and I wanted to see a ROH wrestling show (don't judge me). We were there for a few days, and I passed by these two girls (one was cute, the other ok) a few times in the hall of the hotel we were in, and on the 3rd day we were there, I happened to be at breakfast at the same time as them. They asked me why we came to New York, and I was too embarrassed to say I was going to watch wrestling, but they ended up saying that was why they came there. So we talked about wrestling while we ate, and as I was cleaning up to leave, the cuter one says, ""We should hang out after the show."" My dumbass, without even thinking, replied with, ""I don't think my brother and his friend would want to."" And I walked away. When I got to the show, I looked for them frantically to tell them I changed my mind, and I saw them in their seats, but they were in a higher priced section, so I couldn't go down there without security yelling at me. I lost them after they got up to leave, and didn't ever see them again.

bubbish,AskMen,1388743257.0,"I thought I made my stance on machines pretty clear :) but I can elaborate.

Machines force your motion into a preset path; this exerts stubborn resistance on your muscles from different angles. Not only can it cause injury, you're also denying your muscles from working to stabilize. If you'd do the same exercise on free weights your muscles will automatically do a ton of small adjustments to keep your motion stable and this is good, it builds more muscle and uses up more energy. On a more personal level, I just don't like the way machines makes my body feel. Free weights has more... *oomph*. It's hard to explain, but it just feels like free weights ""hits the spot"" in a way machines never can.

I don't really monitor my diet. I tried counting proteins for a while but it got boring quick, so when in doubt I just eat bigger quantities. If you're looking to gain muscle you can't have too much and don't worry about getting fat, if you stick to healthy foods which are low in carb, high in protein and contain only ""good"" fats you're golden. You said you are limited to what you can eat so I won't go in to detail about healthy foods but there's a lot to be said there.

I also recommend investing in a good protein powder. Whey and casein proteins are dirt cheap and whey in particular is taken up by the body very quickly which makes it ideal for post-workout protein shakes. Supplements are great for nailing the timing of nutrition when you're pressed on time. As a rule of thumb, ingest protein every 3-4 hours during the day, before bed and after waking up. I aim for roughly 2-3 times my body weight in grams of protein per day - you seem to be american so I'm sorry if that clashes with your bizarre imperial system. Maybe google can help?

As for your last question, the answer varies. This is a part you can freestyle on. I usually break my body down into parts that can be trained with similar exercises and do one or two of them during each gym visit. As an example, last month I aimed for exercising my entire body once a week split onto 3 visits. That meant chest and shoulders on monday, upper back and laterals on wednesday, and legs/lower back on friday. As I said, you're free to vary here as long as you follow a rule of letting each muscle rest at least 48 hours to avoid injury. You should start your structuring by deciding what muscles to focus on, and how many times a week you want to exercise each muscle or muscle group.

You might want to study up on plateauing. It's when the body gets ""used"" to a certain exercise or pattern and will slow or even stop the development of muscles. It's not very relevant in the beginning but after 2-3 months of regular training you might want to start varying your exercises which is how you can avoid this phenomenon. It's almost a whole separate subject matter so I'll leave you to google it, but generally variation means changing just about anything in your exercise from range of motion and rep patterns to speed and even mentality.

Sorry for the wall of text, guess I'm more passionate about this than I thought!"

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388743452.0,"&gt; I think many women and feminists have legitimate concern about female representation in the work force and economy along with more social concerns like the way feminine sexuality is represented in the media.

And I think nothing is changing because women are sitting around being very concerned about how nothing is changing.

&gt; If you don't think those concerns are legitimate I'm not really interested in arguing with you because the empirics are quite clear to me at least, that in a post-patriarchal world more than 4% of the Fortune 500 would have female CEOs. 

Not necessarily.  Consider this:  The average CEO is about 60, and it's a pretty tight cluster without a lot outliers.  Which means most CEOS were born between 1945 and 1965, but tending around 1955.  This means they graduated highschool around 1973, and finished college in the late 70s, and were probably Yuppies and part of the Reagan Revolution.  They entered the workforce around 1980, and reached the pinacle of their career sometime in the last decade.

Women who came of age at the same time were the first generation of women to go to college in large numbers, though not as large as men. They did faced quite a lot of sexism, the 80's were pretty bad, but that's when a these battles were fought.  And won.

The problem is winning a battle in the 80's doesn't change the previous thirty years.  It didn't retroactively cause more women to go to business school.  It doesn't change the fact that a lot of women decided that being a mom was actually pretty cool (especially when you're rich).  

In the 1970s, the pool of women funneling into careers that could lead them become CEOs in that generation was very small, and diminished over time as women left the workforce, which is why 4% of CEOs are women.  You would have to make a lot of really bad hiring decision to have 50% of Fortune 500 CEOs be women (and really, what a ridiculous metric).  

Even now, women don't choose to go into the careers that lead to becoming a CEO all that much, especially women from the upper class.  They are underrepresented in the business schools.  And probably will be for some time.  

The only way this changes is if more women decide they want to grow up to be Meg Whitman.  Do you want to grow up to be Meg Whitman?  Are you encouraging the girls around you to grow up to be like Meg Whitman?  Why not?"

The idea was basically, if you're going to separate, it makes her unmarriable thus she wont be able to find another man to care for her, so you owe her money to get her by through life. Then it changed a little to, well if you divorce her and she was a stay at home wife, then she put her career on hold for this marriage, hurting her long term economic potential, so you still owe her something.

But luckily, she's working! You wont get taken to the cleaners as bad as if she wasn't working. You likely wont have to pay anything other than split all the assets and investments you two have made during the marriage. So you'll likely be splitting the house, a car, and savings. You'll also likely pay it in alimony if you don't want to get rid of the home. But that's your call."

oldmonty,tf2,1388743562.0,"I like your idea but I have a few changes to suggest, Ive also thought about this a lot. 

First the primary downside suggested to this idea was that there is no effect in the game to show if you are soaked with water, to this Ill respond that the mad milk effect of having milk droplets on you can be easily modified to use clear droplets instead of opaque ones and it would look like there's water on you. 

Second I would suggest a modification to the second stat where instead of the secondary fire the primary will ""wash"" away milk and jarate as well as fire effects, not bleed though, that wouldnt really make much sense with how the item ""works"" as water already removes fire, jarate, and milk but not bleed.  

So all of this is well and good but it doesnt really amount to enough to make it worth what you have traded which is a huge damage penalty and the sacrifice of the afterburn. 

Modification suggestion 2: the secondary- for its secondary fire I suggest some kind of charge mechanism like the phlogistinator,(I propose that it charge faster but that might be unbalanced) except instead of giving you crits, when you have the meter charged you can use your secondary fire. The secondary fire will have a tie-in with the primary, I have an idea in mind but this can be polished or modified later. 

My version is that once it is charged up with the secondary,  you can unleash some kind of radius-based damage effect which hits everyone, as long as they are in range and have been soaked, with massive damage. I'm thinking some kind of electric shock type of effect on account of the water-gun idea we are starting with. So basically you would soak a bunch of people but not do that much damage, the meter builds and you unleash massive damage in one burst. This would be awesome if you had an almost full meter then ended up behind a group of people and quickly sprayed them down and rightclicked killing all of them. Then you would also have the neon melee in case you had to take care of one enemy by themselves. 

So the final stats I suggest would be:

Primary fire soaks enemy targets and washes friendlies

-30% damage penalty

No afterburn damage

No airblast

All water damage charges storm(or other funny valve word) meter, activate to unleash an electrical storm damaging soaked enemies. 

Edit: 

I just had another idea if you dont like my first one. Instead of an electric shock effect it can be an ice effect, which does some damage(not massive damage like I proposed with the electric version), causes knockback and slows the enemy for a duration. 

The crystal cooler:

Primary fire soaks enemy targets and washes friendlies

-30% damage penalty

No afterburn damage

No airblast

All water damage charges frost meter, activate to unleash a blast of cool air which slows and damages nearby enemies. "

She would also make me do push-ups while beating me to make me more of a man. My step dad thought I was getting used to the belt so he beat me with a brass ruler, which cut open wounds in my butt. During one beating, I started to shit on myself, and that was the only time my mom stopped a beating. It's taken decades to get over what I went through and forgive my mom. I'm 34 with no kids, and I'm still afraid that I'll continue the abuse cycle.
  
But god dammit I want to beat other people's kids sometimes. I know my case was extreme, but I see my friends with their kids and I'm shocked at the level of leniency they give their kids. I have a friend who has a 2 year old son who won't go to bed unless mom reads him a story and stays there until he falls asleep. If she doesn't, he throws a tantrum. They were contemplating taking him to a, I shit you not, sleep therapist. After keeping my Mexican mouth shut, I finally chimed in and said ""he's 2. 2 year olds throw tantrums because they are testing your boundaries. You need to be the parent here and discipline him.""

Out of those projects, select ones that you feel you can contribute to (look through the readme and wiki entries). Pull the code, look through for things that can be improved, added or bugs that can be squashed. Make those changes, compile, test, profile and push the changes back.

Most projects should have systems in place that allow the other contributors to vet your code before merging it back into the main branch.

Check with the ""lead"" project contributor as to how you can advertise your contributions (are you authorised to list it in your resume? Are you authorised to only mention it in interviews?) before you put them on your resume, though.

Failing all of this, create a bunch of your own projects and put them up on GitHub/Google Code. Can't think of a project? How about talking an open source library and write a wrapper around it - how about an app that uses an open source unzip library to unzip all zip files in a given folder?

Can you speak more than one language? How about starting contributions via translation of a gui? I remember that the OpenOffice (before it was bought, then dismantled) guys were always on the lookout for folks to translate their help system and user interface messages. "

datguynamedjoe,AskReddit,1388743983.0,"As someone who falls into sleep paralysis at least once every two weeks, I've become very used to it. When I say that, I say that I am no longer scared of it because when I wake up, I know I'm about to fall into it.

First I wake up and there is an overwhelmingly loud ringing in my ears. I can hear the blood pulsing through my head and it feels as if something in my bedroom is watching me ready to pounce on me at any given moment. When the ringing gets really intense, that's when paralysis kicks in. It feels like something jumps on top of me, pinning down all my limbs with all of its weight on my chest. 

Sometimes during this I have hallucinations in which I usually hear a woman talking to me, telling me about ""evil demons"". Visual hallucinations include seeing figures walk around my room, sitting at the end of my bed or standing on top of me and looking down. These figures are usually a white or grey hooded ""demon"" that are translucent with big empty eyes. I also tend see random items floating around (last night I woke up to see an old oil lamp just casually floating across my room, only to completely dissolve into thin air within seconds). On top of seeing random items, things in my room that are supposed to be there aren't always there. Like I'll wake up and apparently all my furniture, except for my bed, is missing. 

I've had sleep paralysis for as long as I can remember so when I wake up in the middle of the night to my ears ringing, I know I'm about to see some weird shit. Now it's kind of like me waking up in this situation and thinking ""Oh god, here we go."" Over the years, I am now actually able to control it, so when my ears start ringing, I just have to focus really hard on trying to get up. So my advice? Just fucking focus really hard on trying to wake up and sit up in bed. It takes some practice but eventually it's something you master to get rid of sleep paralysis and overcome the fear of it. "

azoenophile,AskWomen,1388744031.0,"My paternal grandparents. 

They disowned my father when Dad was disfellowshipped from their church. Didn't attend my parents' wedding. When I was born, they finally decided to be decent to my parents so they could have a relationship with me (and later my sister). They force-fed us their crazy religious doctrine whenever we would stay the night. 

They have always favored my cousin, their only grandson. He is a member of their church and his father is an elder in their branch of crazy. When cousin got married, they were ecstatic. Hosted visiting guests, kept gifts at their house and were there while cousin and his wife opened them, helped planning, etc. Have had cousin and his new wife over for dinner once a week ever since. 

My baby sister got married last December. They decided The Lord was calling them out of country on a mission trip, and couldn't be bothered to show up. (Unless they actually attended the annual family ski trip in canada with their other son and his family, to which we have never been invited.) 

They've been crappy family and crappy support. They have repeatedly hurt my sister and both my parents. While they haven't been nearly as awful to me (I moved away seven years ago), it tears me apart to see the tension in my family. Grandpa is a contractor and before they moved, my dad asked him to do a very specific lighting thing. Grandpa TOTALLY fucked it up, and then charged dad something like $30k.

tmbyfc,todayilearned,1388744400.0,"There are many accusations that can be rightfully laid at Wakefield's door, one of which is that his 1998 paper caused the immunisation take up rate for MMR to fall dramatically, and therefore incidence of the diseases to rise substantially. However, there has only been one death in the UK since 1998 (in fact since 1992) from measles. The victim was not immunised, however he was part of a travelling community (gypsies) that historically have extremely low levels of immunisation due to their lifestyle. It is unknown whether the victim was not immunised as a result of the MMR scare or simply because his community did not use medical services to the same extent as the rest of the population (and so whether blame can be laid at Wakefield's door). 

The fatality rate in developed countries among otherwise healthy subjects with good nutrition etc is 0.1%. It's pretty rare to die from measles unless you live in the third world, where it's pretty easy, but where there is no evidence that the MMR scare had any effect. There have been a few (&lt;10) deaths in France, some in Bulgaria (where medical care is less developed and it is unclear what vaccination rates were in any case) and I can find none in the US since 1998 (perhaps someone else may be able to provide evidence of some, I have looked and cannot find any). It is hard to know with the data available how many of those deaths that have occurred are as a *direct* result of the lower vaccination rate resulting *specifically* because of the MMR scare (or hoax, or fraud, whatever you want to call it). Some people wouldn't have been vaccinated in any case.

The point is, Wakefield was hugely damaging to human health and very possibly for entirely bogus and corrupt reasons. But we're talking about science, and using hyperbole and unfounded claims, which I consider ""asshole killed hundreds of children, he's a mass murderer"" to be, is not helpful. It is factually incorrect and an emotive exaggeration, which is the kind of shit the anti-vaxxers love to pull, and which people who believe in science should avoid. The science is on our side, you don't have to make shit up to be right."

The two story DLCs are excellent--they made me really excited for DAI. Mark of the Assassin is more humorous/silly (I played it several times over just to hear all the extra companion dialogue!), but there are a couple of fights that will kick your ass. It takes you out of Kirkwall and to a fancy Orlesian party. 

Legacy is more serious and is just plain awesome. New darkspawn lore, cool fights, lots of questions about what it might mean in DAI... I will say it's kind of designed for you to take Varric, Anders, and your sibling as your companions. There's extra content for all three of them. The other companions do get new ambient dialogue, but nothing extra special story-wise just for them. 

Do you have Sebastian? He adds a couple of smaller missions. People seem to either completely adore him or totally hate him, so YMMV. 

The item packs are nice, but they kind of get rid of the need to save up and buy the best gear.

A_for_Anonymous,AskMen,1388745607.0,"Don't get married that so ridiculously young, much less to a person you don't seem to be sexually compatible with. Why rush it? Don't be so desperate for commitment; what's in it for you? Thoroughly try before you buy, live together for years, have lots of successful sex, be sure you fully know all there is to your partner and see if he changes through the years... Especially since you're that young and both of you are still growing up as people, becoming adults and deciding who you are. You may end up married to a person you don't want. The chances for marriages failing and ending up in divorce or living hell are high enough; don't make them skyrocket by marrying young and soon. And for the love of all things good, don't have kids nearly that young. You don't want to be a single mom, your boyfriend doesn't want to be screwed by law, and most of all your kids don't want to have divorced parents."

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388745667.0,"&gt; I grew up and then started experiencing attraction to certain behaviors based on the way society shaped me. I didn't decide to be who I am, this is merely an illusion people create to find comfort in control. 

That's novel, I've never seen anyone use the ""No, but I *am* a mindless sheep."" argument.  I've kind of been waiting for this day all my life.

So this is weird.   To recognize that you are shaped by society implies either that you were trained by society to recognize that you are trained by society but not to comprehend what that means, which is just like some *Inception* level shit, or alternately you're demonstrating a level of self-awareness that, in of itself, invalidates the claim that you are programed by society for failure.

&gt;I didn't decide to be who I am, this is merely an illusion people create to find comfort in control.

What if you are who you decide to be every moment, and the illusion is the continuity of being that you feel beholden to?  Drop some acid and listen to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npo9aDZEKq0), and then come back and tell me again about how who you are is an ""illusion.""

It's all fucking illusions, man.  You have to pull the wool over your own eyes.

&gt;Psychology shows that genetics and upbringing effect the emotional state and personality of a person, feminism as a viewpoint does nothing to override this. You need to prove that the feminist viewpoint has clear psychological effects on everyone that harbors it if your statements are to hold true.

What are ""clear psychological effects?""  What does that even mean?

Feminism presents a model of reality. It's a fucked up model that does not accurately reflect reality.  If you make decisions based off this model of reality, you will make inefficient and ineffective decisions.

You will, for example, decide the best way to promote awareness of women's issues is to tell people to ""[Shut the fuck up!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avu5NT1ZYT8)"" with a megaphone. Where people are filming you.  So you can become a big dumb internet joke.

&gt;If you keep making baseless claims and speculating, you're the first world feminist of this conversation. The burden of proof is on you here, but since you haven't presented your evidence yet you obviously have none. 

Go read Tumblr sometime.  "
csreid,nfl,1388745669.0,"Pressures are important, too, even though they aren't as he's sexy. Even if the rush doesn't get there, their presence in the backfield is important.

Also, the guys on the ends usually have to set the edge on run plays. 

For example... the Colts have trouble containing mobile quarterbacks. This is because Robert Mathis is an excellent pass rusher, and great at bringing pressure, but not so great at setting the edge. He got better as the season went on, but Terrell Pryor absolutely shredded us early in the season. This is because Mathis would go flying back past the pocket, sometimes 10-15 yards into the backfield, trying to create a pass rush, and all of a sudden there was a gaping hole for the QB to run through. 

That was barely relevant, but I just wanted to mention that those pass rushers have other jobs, and things can go bad when they don't do them well. "

topdnbass,LeagueofLegendsMeta,1388745893.0,"It's good. Gragas is an extremely versatile champion.  
He can successfully be played mid (traditional AP), top (tanky bruiser), supp, and in the jungle as either AP or tanky bruiser. Hell he's even played AD sometimes and that works well too.

A lot of this comes down to his W giving him a lot of free stats, his high base dmg/stats, his attack speed slow on Q (ADC killer), his gamechanging ult, and his amazing sustain via his passive.  
His base damage and utility is high enough where he's not extremely item reliant, so sending him to the jungle (lower income) or building him tanky works well.  
Come 6 he's like a roaming gragas who can make big plays with his ult.  

His clear is good, his sustain is good, the only real flaw is that pre-6 his ganks are average. Yes he has a slow but it's usually level 1 and you'll often need to flash to even apply it.

&gt; I am not gay, but am a big supporter of GLBT rights and what not. 

You realize that if you were gay, you wouldn't be attracted to her, right? She looks and dresses like a woman. She identifies as a woman. So you'd have to be a woman to be interested in her *and* gay.

&gt; Should I move on simply because of the sex, or is it possible for me to just give up my sexuality for the love of my GF?

PIV sex isn't the only thing you two can do together, but if it's really important to you, you'll have to weigh your options.

You should be supportive to the extent that you're comfortable. If you feel like vaginal sex is really important to you right now, that's obviously going to be a problem. If you are willing to do something else, that's ok too. She may or may not be looking to get the surgery. If she is, you can look forward to that.

Explanation: After 55 minutes the respawn times of a character are long (about 70 seconds) and the game was very close. While the red team has not been able to finish the game with their last push even though they outnumbered them 2 of them died it basically meant blue team would win. At 0:46 you see a character of the red team distracting one of the blue team to buy xPeke (Red team) some time.

He uses an ability to teleport back into the enemy base and try to finish the final building while his own base is getting destroyed. 

Not only does it show incredible teamwork (distraction) it shows willpower(never give up!), mechanical skill (dodging spells from the blue team by jumping around, predicting where it will land). It also shows how much energy and joy E-sports, or a video game can bring out. 

(The player xPeke was very humble and sportsmanlike after the match congratulating and complimenting the other team for their great performance saying this match proved they are one of the best teams in the world)

""xPeke's backdoor at IEM Katowice"" was voted best play in League of Legends in 2013

Edit: I could have foreseen that this will provoke a discussion wether or not it's a sport or not. It's all about how you define sport. E-sports like Starcraft, Dota or LoL are a niche where only a couple of hundred people actually earn a living of practicing it. While it may not demand physical strength it requires a lot of dedication(8-14 hours practice a day), eye-hand coordination and most importantly being able to concentrate for a long period of time.

Golf, chess, poker, pool are all considered sport. But i would not consider myself an athlete if I sit around with my friends playing some poker. But people that are consistently making their living with it are, in my eyes athletes. All these mentioned are sports that require barely any physical strength or endurance. 

**TL;DR I would not say I am an athlete cause I am sitting in my room playing video games but if someone is dedicating their live around it, earning quite a lot of money, getting visa's by the US Government and sponsorships by companies like Samsung or airlines I do think it can be considered a niche sport**"

As communism is of socialist approach then many of the things were given freely (healthcare, housing, education, even holidays!). Being unemployed was nearly impossible as there were always so many places to work at.

What I meant was that there weren't (most probably) direct benefits in form of a cash payments due to lower wages. Also even getting those freebies from government was not that easy, you had to had ways to increase waiting times or get to a queue at all as otherwise people had to wait for 15-20 years just to get that ""free"" flat.

People still had to look after themselves, meaning being operative for example to get some goods as those were in very short supply. Whole system was also rather wrong as it was funding its expenditure (in Poland) using overseas loans, eventually collapsing."

Capetorial,gaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyy,1388747257.0,"As a matter of discussion, I don't think Christian values are invulnerable to criticism or Christians or the religious themselves. I just think it's fucked when we attack someone for being homophobic when he's just religious and following his bible as a book of facts, as a good Christian should. As a good 'scientist' (using the term loosely of course) I have to follow my observations as facts, their logic is not the same and I resent that but what I don't resent is the opinions they gain from their manner of thinking. See, it's the manner of thinking that's the source of the problem. Anti-faggotry is just a consequence.

I honestly don't think I should have children. I don't think I should breed or adopt, I shouldn't raise children, I'm a sociopath - I don't have the facilities to properly raise them to the world's crazy standards of morals (I'd absolutely kill a single father for $100k and if I wished to keep my morals balanced, I'd simply have to use $20k of it on people in need of vital medicines - done, total lives lost is in negative by my action =&gt; I am moral. This 'flawed' logic is why I shouldn't raise kids) but my SO, she wants kids and she'd make a wonderful mother. Therefore it's a net gain to the world for us to raise children.

The other problem with your logic is while I will defend this guy on some levels (I'm really only countering flawed logic) I'm an atheist at the end of the day. Atheists should be breeding. Like hell. We need to make more of us. I'm not saying shove atheism down our kids throats but simply that we should breed (as children tend to copy their parents) to fight off the inevitable muslim immigration surge (as several other countries have experienced, look into it - laws get changed for the worse) and mormon rapid-breeding. We need votes in our favor or we risk allowing the world falling into the hands of the religious and bringing about a new dark age.

Why am I explaining this? Because the fact that you would even hint that an atheist (that is clearly at least not retarded nor extremely defunct) shouldn't breed shows you have no idea what the condition of the world is right now. Honestly, if anyone shouldn't raise kids out of the two of us, it's you. You're oblivious of the world and you defy cold logic. Yes, I use cold logic, but its consistent and fair."

&gt;A needle is coming at you. You move right? 

I can, with 100% honesty, say that every single time in my life that a needle was coming at me, I made every effort to hold as still as possible and not flinch.

See, I have a lot of tattoos.  Which are applied with needles.  And have I never been attacked by a seamstress, so I can't say I've ever had a needle thrown or stabbed at me.  So bad example to use for your argument.  Luckily I know what you were getting at.

&gt;Once you have something that is bad you aren't a nihilist anymore, as you have at least one measure of utility.

Except, as your critical example failure demonstrated, its very hard to say exactly what is good, and what is bad.  Pain has good qualities.  I wouldn't want a life without pain.

Hey assholes, sometimes it's not about money or education and people just genuinely want to help other people.

there was a study done here in Denmark, on how prestigious men and women viewed different educations to be and it found that men thought traditionally female fields such as nursing were much more prestigious than women did and the traditionally male fields in higher education (such as law, medicine etc.) were thought of as much more prestigious by women than men. Perceived prestige was found to be a huge driving force for when women pick an education but much, much less so for men (many traditionally male fields in education are now dominated by women at a 8/10 ratio, 7 out of 12 of the traditionally most prestigious fields are completely female dominated)."

How *dare* you doubt my word? That's not okay! Statistics indicate that I'm probably not lying! I waited this long to come forward because I was confused and didn't want to face my rapist because I was emotionally distraught!

Hey, congrats /u/AsLongAsItsFree, you're now totally unable to get a job because your name has been published in the papers as a ""potential rapist."" Anyone accused of rape (unless they're a celebrity) is automatically assumed to be guilty, because unlike what feminists like to say, there is no such thing as ""rape culture"" and rape is most definitely *not* considered acceptable. Your repuation is shot, your friends and family don't know if they can be around you anymore, and even if it's proven that you were elsewhere or whatever, you'll probably get tons of ""well they *could* have done it"" and you'll always be ""that person accused of rape"".

It's easy to take sides in this sort of argument up until you consider what would happen to you if some crazy bitch ex of yours decided that she was going to accuse you of rape in order to get back at you. I don't believe that ""2%"" bullshit, not for a second, because I've personally heard of far too many instances of women claiming their partners sexually or physically abused them in order to hurt them or get custody or whatever: look at the stats concerning domestic violence. Women lie about that shit *all the time* because of how easy it is to get away with, due to the nature of domestic violence laws. More often than not the man is arrested regardless of how does the hitting, because that's how the laws are phrased: they assume the man is always the guilty party. Anyone who says ""false accusations don't happen"" hasn't spent enough time with horrible women to realize how incredibly petty they can be.

**TL;DR: If it's proven that you lied about being raped, you should be punished.** Rape shouldn't be some special crime where the word of the woman is always accepted as is, it would be far too easy to abuse, and those who say women wouldn't possibly abuse it are naive and lying to themselves. Women aren't some race of innocent flowers that can do no wrong, women are people, and people lie all the fucking time. It's ludicrous to believe that women ""wouldn't lie about something so serious as rape.""

**Edit:** An acceptable compromise would be making it illegal to publish the name of a person accused of rape. That alone would make rape accusations more believable, since it would essentially eliminate the problem of ruining someone's reputation. If a woman has nothing to gain from lying about rape, then it follows that they would be far less inclined to do so."

As it's harder in Poland we normally have multi skills as if I can't fix someone's car to earn money, I will paint his house. As Britain is quite rich people more of the times now only one thing to do and just do it. If they have to re-skill it's getting an issue - quite possibly one of the reasons UK having high unemployment now.

There is also a fact that people who emigrated are mostly the ones really wanting to work. The lazy Poles stayed at home. Also, times change, Poland gets in better situation every year and people tend to have approach similar to the one seen in rich countries."

&gt;Anyway, have you heard of the Bechdel Test? It exists because women are not taken seriously except in the context of being validated by a man.

The Bechdel Test comes from a comic strip.  It exists because Lisa Bechdel was trying to be pithy, and is a feminist.  It's not a real measure of anything, and whether a film passes the test or not has nothing at all to do with whether the film is good, bad, sexist, or not.

Here's my favorite movie that passes the Bechdel Test, [Barbarian Queen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjhugEaHzYU)  This movie passes the test in pretty much every single scene, except the multiple rape scenes, and the bondage torture scenes.  But fuckloads of women talking to each other about things other than men."

I've posted elsewhere about receiving a verbal invitation to drive to my parent's for a belated Christmas last weekend. I thought it was entirely directed at a hope I'd pick up a relative who was reasonably expected to have difficulty making the trip and lives nearest me. My suspicion on this was especially strong since she opened by saying that person was coming. 

When I talked with the person, I found out they were never really certain of going. Car issues with a used car they'd just bought meant they likely weren't going to be able to attend even if they wanted to anyways.

Certainly I've not been invited to anything by her for the last almost ten years, so you can understand my disbelief. 

Welp, I guess I may have spoken too soon. It seems I had received a Christmas card inviting me as well. It had slipped into one of those junk mail packets where they fold it and just fasten the ends together with a sticker. 

I'm not sure it really indicates she wasn't up to something, seeing as it was post marked around the same time the car problems came up which might have prevented the relative from attending. Can't say for sure as I don't know the exact point the car problems started. 

I really hate that I am torn between guilt and suspicion. Tired of being caught in the middle is really why I've been trying to be NC for the last almost ten years.

Brightt,DebateReligion,1388748937.0,"Okay, as someone who was born and raised atheist, let me give you an example.

You are raised without any preconceived notion of god(s), religion or anything of that order. You have no idea anyone in the world believes in a higher power.

All of a sudden, some guy walks up to you and asks if you've heard about Jesus (I'm assuming you're Christian). You say no. Then he tells a long story about how every human is evil, although you have no reason to believe this claim, and this evil was put into you by some creature/force that rules the universe. The only way to get rid of this evil is to believe that his son, who is also himself, sacrificed himself to rid all of us from the evil he put into us himself in the first place. If you do that, and give money to a big organization, go to church every once in a while and confess your sins to an old virgin, you will get to live in heaven with this creature that made you evil to begin with for ever!

Now, tell me exactly why I have the obligation to prove to *you* that any of that is true, as opposed to you proving to *me* any of that is true?

The default position is not believing something until it is proven correct.

If I claim I can fly, but don't prove it to you, and demand you prove to me that I can't fly, would you take me seriously?"

I can add however that in our country we are not used to a modern western approach of dating when women ask man for a date. Obviously it does happen, now probably more often then years ago. I'm more than sure though it's less common there than here.

There was an English girl who was basically trying to get a date with me. She even asked me for a cup of tea and I said ""yes, sure"" not realising it was a date NOT a friend's meeting. Maybe I was an inexperienced blind guy or as I've said it didn't strike me at first that a girl basically asks me out. Anyway, I was not interested in her because of number of reasons.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388749712.0,"You'll hate my basic income plans then.

Unfortunately, the argument about there being no drive is overblown, and if you look [here](http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/conf/conf30/conf30a.pdf) when they tried some experiments on the NIT, which is sort of like basic income, they only seen a 17% reduction in work efforts, and that could have  easily been overreported in order to abuse the benefits structure. COnsidering there are 3 jobs for every 1 opening and unemployment is high, I think a small portion of people leaving the workforce is a ""market correction"" more than anything.

Or, I think you hit the nail in the head when you say ""the same amount""...that's the problem...we have a welfare system that  tries to make people work, yet punishes them for doing so. If we were to establish basic income and work it into the tax structure, EVERYONE gets a benefit. And if that benefit is unconditional and only clawed back via taxes, then people wouldn't be punished by working, since their pay working will simply be added on top of the basic income.

Unfortunately, as the study points out, people prefer to tie income to labor, so NIT and basic income and other similar ideas have never taken off. I find this saddening, considering how in a society as rich as ours we allow people to be homeless and starve (it would be different if there was an actual shortage in resources), and with jobs disappearing due to downsizing, offshoring, and automation, they likely aren't gonna come back.

Anyway, to go back to your point, which is Obama, people are on welfare under obama not because obama is some welfare president (as you can see I have MUCH more proactive views on that), but because more people need it. We're in a bad recession, people go on stuff like unemployment and welfare more often. Simple causal relationship. The jobs  aren't here any more, and I'm really beginning to wonder, with corporate profits soaring to an all time high but the wealth not trickling down, if this is the new normal. Looking at the factors going into a lack of job creation, I'm starting to think it is."

Except there is a fundamental problem, in that when you substitute other terms, you create a testable hypothesis.

We can test whether Stalin had fleas in his moustache.  We'd need a time machine, and we have no idea how to create one, but if we had one we could at test that hypothesis.  Also, the answer to the question ""Did Stalin's mustache have fleas?"" is trivial.

&gt;At any rate, I trust the point is clear: you've moved from lack of knowledge to unknowability (and here I agree with you; though you didn't lay out your reasoning for the movement, I think there are a couple solid lines of argument that can get you there). This first move is fine, but then you've jumped from unknowability to inexistence, which is quite a leap!

You're ignoring that I said *essentially* doesn't exist.  It could very well exist, but if we can never know whether it exists or not, then we can never know what it is, which means it might as well not exist.  Whether it exists or not, we must act as if it does not exist.

I say we must admit this because it is logically necessary, and its assumed that we are attempting to be rational.  If one admits that one cannot known what the purpose of existence is, then one cannot claim to be acting on an understanding of the purpose existence, as that would necessarily contradict the first claim.

Quite quickly you realise you need to earn more to make an actual living (believe me, plenty of migrants have doubts, something along lines ""Why the hell did I move here, to a completely new place, leaving all my friends and family and everything else behind, just to earn enough to buy food from promotion and share a room with some stinking guy""). Then it's to make a ""normal"" living. Later they realise they can possibly earn even more. I was thinking similar and know of many who did as well. Romanians and Bulgarians most probably won't be an exception here. Obviously there will be some who will stay at the minimum and won't bother going even one step above but that's probably minority."

What's the operating system on your computer? It's likely either Windows or OS X, which means you've likely shoveled a little bit of your money into the hands of the wealthy 20% who work at Microsoft or Apple. What type of food is in your cupboard? In all likelihood, you have food in there made by Tyson, Pepsi Co., General Mills, or Nestle, which means you've probably shoveled a little bit of your money at those companies. Where do you go shopping? If it's a major corporate retailer like Walmart or Target, you're shoveling your money both at the rich again. Where do you fill up on gas? What type of car do you drive? What type of clothes are you wearing? Who was the manufacturer of your cell phone? If you depend on corporate America for any of those conveniences, you're once again just willingly giving your money towards the same major corporations you're complaining about.

So if you want to protest, don't protest the corporations; protest the ignorance and hypocrisy of the average American consumer."

Kayden01,AskReddit,1388750007.0,"The reply you got is semi-accurate. Some of our asylum seekers are actual asylum seekers, seeking refuge from religious persecution, war, famine etc. What people get upset about are what are termed 'economic refugees'. People seeking asylum from being poor - and doing so illegally. 

A significant proportion of Oz's 'boat people' are middle class people from Pakistan/mid east/Indonesia etc who find that paying people smugglers, then claiming refugee status once arrived is far more efficient than the regular immigration channels. 

This is significantly exacerbated by the people smugglers methods of bringing people over - one of the more common activities is to leave Indonesia with 50 - 100 people on board a fishing boat, get 10km off the Indonesian shore, then place an emergency call to the Australian Navy, claiming that the boat is sinking. A Navy ship will almost always then head for the smuggler boat, pick up all the passengers, then drop them off in Oz for refugee processing. The costs to Oz are enormous."

Yes, I meant body weight in kilos. Your weight is helpfully translated by Google to roughly 60 kg. If I were you I'd go for around 150 grams of protein each day. It sounds like a lot but broken down into meals, snacks and shakes it's quite manageable. Google is extremely helpful for finding out nutritional values of different foods. Try googling ""egg nutrition"" and you'll see what I mean.

I only lift, I don't do any cardio mostly because I haven't found anything I think is fun. Jogging is quite tedious. Squash is fun but I only have time for two sessions a month or so.

You're pulling this ""fact"" of your ass. Ever actually tried to build a computer? Please frequent /r/buildapc and they'll give you builds close to the price of a PS4 and that too with a superior performance.

&gt; The games have always been especially optimized to get their quality (It is incredibly easy to optimize a console game as every console is the same and you know what it can do, however every PC is different, all the parts made by different companies for different things, making it very hard to optimize for a PC.)

Again, pulling things out of your ass. For starters the 360 and the PS3 were incredibly different, whereas the PS4 and the xbox One are pretty much similar to PC's. Moreover, optimisation is not some magical wand you can hover and make games look amazingly better. Games got better over the previous gen because the consoles had terrible architecture with which the developers needed more time to squeeze power out of, not because they were infnitely powerful. And this time around the consoles are pretty much the same in architecture so they can't actually pull a magic trick hence you have the new consoles not being able to handle 60 fps on 1080p in most games.

It's also important to remember that the Black Power movement which promoted the concept of Black Pride is an artifact of the 70s, the decade immediately following the end of the Civil Rights Movement.

Black Power was about a black community finally free from the yoke of legalized oppression, that sought to lift itself up and achieve equality on its own terms.

And then Hoover decided that empowered black people was COMMUNISM!!! and totally destroyed the black power movement, giving rise to gangs and gang culture.  Yay white people!"

lawlietreddits,AskReddit,1388750721.0,"If we're doing e-sports, might as well talk about [The Play.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq1afiKQb8)

Some people asked what went on so here it is (skipping the whole team background story and stuff):

- IG on The Dire side (red) initiating on Na'Vi on The Radiant side (green) with Naga Siren. At the time Naga was a very, very strong carry. And this mostly came from how she could use her ultimate Song of the Siren to initiate and set up a wombo combo. She is still used to great effect as a carry by Meracle but is mostly a viable support now.

- Song of the Siren: Naga sings and for the duration all enemy heroes, creeps and buildings are both unable to do anything (move, attack, use items, etc.) and invulnerable.

- The combo: various alternative but in this case it was Dark Seer using his ability Vacuum to scoop all enemies in an area into a single spot. Then Tidehunter used his ultimate Ravage (the tentacles) to damage and stun all enemies. Basically everyone is caught in disables and damage galore.

Now, this was fine. You could just ban one of them. But Na'vi didn't. Instead they decided to go head on against the combo and counter it. Right as the song ends but before Ravage hits:

- Enigma (the purple dude) uses the Black King Bar item to become magic immune so Ravage doesn't affect him.

- Juggernaut uses Bladefury (the spin thingy) skill which also grants him magic immunity.

- Rubick (black/green mage) uses the item Force Staff to push himself away from the Ravage before it hits him.

Because of this:

- Enigma is able to use his ultimate Black Hole (Malzahar ult in an AoE) on the clumped up IG team.

- Juggernaut goes to town on the clumped up enemies with the spin while Enigma disables them.

- Rubick is able to disable Lina by levitating her (the fire chick) and, more importantly, use his ultimate Spell Steal to take Tidehunter's last used spell. Which was Ravage."

MoustacheSanctuary,AskFeminists,1388750822.0,"&gt;Do Danish men think nurses are more valuable than doctors?

the study didn't specify, it was seen as more prestigious, it's very hard to get into medicine and it's a very hard and long education(I have about 20 penis jokes for that). I think overall doctors are seen as more valuable because of their qualifications, but in some ways nurses are valued much more because they are the ones primarily caring for the patient, and they're the only ones that actually have time to do so.

&gt;Is it perceived privilege that doctors are paid more than nurses?

nope, Doctors are some seriously stressed out people in a hospital while the nurses actually don't have it that bad, that's my experience at least. Becoming a nurse is much easier than a doctor and there's a lot more of them and there's simply so many things they can't do because they don't have the training and qualifications, I should probably note that the difference in salary is probably going to be much smaller than in America (except for doctors with their own practice, they can make serious bank if they work hard, but even then I'd think doctors in the US comparatively make much more) because we have the lowest level of income inequality along with Norway in the world (if my memory serves me right)."

If you set the population to around 230 million, or every adult citizen, factor in $2.6 trillion in other government spending (about what it would cost for universal healthcare and other government programs assuming the entire social safety net as we know it is dismantled and replaced with UBI), it could be paid for with a 40% flat income tax, and a 40% corporate tax (or, like a 42% income with lower corporate, but I keep high corporate because I've been told to not do so could lead to more abuses). With this, we could fund a basic income of $15,000 a year.

Lowering the rates a bit we can fund smaller basic incomes as well. 35% would fund $12k instead of $15k. 32% would fund $10k. This does, of course, assume perfect collection rates so it might be a more on paper plan as opposed to something fully workable in the real world with those exact numbers.

tmbyfc,todayilearned,1388751494.0,"I'm on mobile so hard to check fully, but I certainly wouldn't use that site as a primary source, even if I agree with the broad thrust of it. There are plenty of gov/NGO sites in the us and europe that provide trustworthy data, those are the ones I use and which show a large increase in cases of measles, but very few deaths. Just so I'm clear: people should vaccinate. Measles is a horrible and preventable disease, one extra death is one too many and Wakefield has much to answer for. But we defeat bullshit by sticking to the facts, not by creating more of our own.

EDIT: When I say ""very few deaths"" that's my privileged white western ass talking. It's really important to remember that currently about [158,000](http://www.measlesrubellainitiative.org/learn/the-problem/) people die across the world annually from measles [almost all in the developing world], a fact that people who don't believe in vaccination and who like to make out that measles isn't that serious, don't often like to talk about."

wordserious,AskReddit,1388751802.0,"The problem is that the number of ancestors grows exponentially with each generation you go back. You are 1, your parents are 2, grandparents 4, great-grandparents 8 and so forth.

Considering an average generation to be 20 years (because although today it is closer to 25, 1000 years ago it would have been much less), that's 40 generations. At first brush this would be 2^40 ancestors, which is 1.099511627776 × 10^12, or more than a trillion people.

There have never been so many humans alive, though, and this number comes from the fact that all humans are related to each other to some extent. To some degree, this means that I descend from a big portion of the human population that was alive 1000 years ago.

Therefore 1000 years ago my ancestors were doing most of the things that was possible for humans to be doing 1000 years ago.

Necron_Overlord,changemyview,1388752289.0,"&gt;Asserting that something is logically necessary doesn't make it so.

Okay, it's very late, and I'm very tired, and this argument is veering into semantics.  So I'm just going to propose a challenge, and if I'm right, you'll be stumped and if I;m wrong you'll demonstrate it soon enough:

How does one act on an unknowable proposition?

It seems to me that it can't be done.  It's a paradox.  You cannot act on a proposition that you cannot know.

&gt;It is, for example, ultimately unknowable whether my partner loves me, just as it is unknowable whether my dog loves me.

Yeah, but your partner knows.  So it's not really unknowable.  And you can ask, and trust.  So its knowable in some sense.  Not an ""ultimate"" sense, but some sense.

The purpose of existence is not even remotely of the same quality.  There is nobody who knows, not that anyone has identified.  There is no one you can ask.  No one you can even trust and hope is telling you the right answer.  We don't even know how to begin to look for an answer to this question.

This is not a matter of uncertainty.  This is a matter of having a question which cannot be answered in any meaningful way by any means we can conceive of.  It is unknowable, unlike all the examples you've given.

&gt;I'm not saying you should bet on ultimate purpose--I'm not doing so my own self--but rather that you're being fundamentally illogical in refusing to accept that you're just making a bet like everyone else.

How could I bet on ultimate purpose if **I can't know what that is?**  This is my problem with your argument.  How am I making a bet?  What am I betting on?  There are no other options that aren't leaps into the absurd."

I guess there's a chance that others might not feel that way, but it's just so simple to give it a shot. Particularly if the animal suffering gets to you.

silverionmox,Futurology,1388752341.0,"&gt; Basic income in definitely not a form of Social Security. The whole premise of Social Security is that you pay into a system during your working career and when you retire, you get money being payed by people who are currently working to pay for your check.

No, that's just our current setup. A basic income would provide income security just as well, therefore it's a form of social security.

&gt;Are you suggesting you tax someone who is making $30,000 a year at the same rate that you tax someone who is making $300,000,000 a year? If not, I guess I'm just confused by what you mean when you say ""tax all forms of income equally"".

Even if you make $30k a year, putting in $2k a year between ages 25 and 65 earning 10% interest gets you a little over a million dollars ($1,064,222.13) before fees. This doesn't even include any company match you may get. 

I'm always stunned when I run into a coworker who makes as much as I do and doesn't participate in the retirement plan. I've had one co-worker tell me she probably wouldn't live that long and therefore was spending everything now!!! She'll probably live to 105! 

And yes, I understand if you make under a certain amount, investing in your retirement account is a challenge.

Litteraly bathe in a good quality 'allergy-safe' lotion after each shower and you should be able to shave like normal again in a week. Of course its better for your skin if you do use some kind of shaving cream, and a quality razor or at least a new one will help too just while you get used to what pressure and angles your skin wants to be shaved with now.

Grapeseed oil has helped me reduce razor burn, I exfoliate with coconut or a soft luffa before shaving, then shave using a men's facial razor (3-4 blades) and just some imperial lather bar soap, I rinse off, dry off, then use grapeseed oil as a lotion after the shower.

silverionmox,Economics,1388753027.0,"&gt; For one, that's not really competition in that once you have the government contract you competed for, you can do what you like with your prices.

Obviously the price you're going to sell your services for is fixed in the contract.

&gt;That in fact happened in our state run health care for children. 

It's not because your state didn't run their health care well that it's impossible in principle. I can choose which doctor I go to, even though we have a third payer system that reimburses most of the costs.

&gt;I certainly won't get backed into defending our central banking system,

I said that I didn't agree with private banks having the power to create credit without restriction.

&gt;and absentee ownership has never been a serious issue, so I don't know where you're going with that one.

Absentee ownership is the ownership of things you don't use.

&gt;so I don't know where you're going with that one.

I didn't agree with those instutions either, so that's not unique to your situation."

I never said I was nihilist.  I said that all rational philosophical positions must begin from nihilism.  That should have been your first clue that I don't identify as a nihilist.

&gt;I don't care if you can't demonstrate that there is no 'meaning' to the universe. I don't think there is either.

So...you agree with me?

&gt;I think you're actually closer to being an existentialist than a nihilist.

That's probably because I am an existentialist.

&gt;Have a go at reading some Camus, Sarte or Nietzsche - these guys grappled with similar problems to what you're thinking about, and came up with very strong answers to them.

Feroc,MMORPG,1388753281.0,"There are things I agree with and some that I don't agree with. I am sure I will end at the bottom at this page, but my need to talk about this subject is just too high.

I'll start with the parts where I agree, just to collect some love at the beginning of my post.

**Bring the class not the player**

If I play an MMO, I want to play a character. He's weak at the beginning, can't find, can't cast and wears some old clothes. That's my character and I want to build him up. He should get powerful and earn gold, gear and virgins (yes, the virgins are important!). 

I don't want to be able to kill a level 20 character with my level 100 character, just because I've played some FPS for years and I am able to aim for his head faster.

And of course I want my character as unique as possible. That includes, that my class is important, that my class can do something no other class can.

**Leveling should take long**

I just don't like the idea, that a lot of people think the fun starts with max level and the raids or instances at max level. The leveling part can be fun and important for the character, too. Maybe we need to tweak the kind of leveling a bit, maybe take a look at different systems like Eve Online did.

But of course there are parts where I don't agree with you...

**Not everything was better in the past**

Remember the first time [enter cool MMO even in the past here]? Or the feeling when you [enter great social exchange here]? Yes, those were great times, but those times don't come back, just because we'll use the old systems again. In the past the player base was different, the expectations were different and technical possibilities were different.

Personally I don't want to spend hours standing in the city, looking for a group for the next dungeon. I want that cool ""Dungeon Finder"", I can play my game and when a group is ready I can join them. That's not destroying any community either or is there any special social skill needed to spam the chat with ""Class X looking for a group for XYZ, call me!"". That's neither fun nor are there any skills needed.

My conclusion: Bring the class, make the leveling interesting, maybe even trash those instances at all, but don't try to cut down the innovation of the games."

Nej, din løsning er ubrugelig og meningsløs. Folk begår ikke forbrydelser fordi de tror det er godt at gøre, de gør det fordi de er ligeglade.

Axez' løsning er at råde folk til at låse deres døre. Din løsning er at fortælle indbrudstyve at det altså er noget puha-bad at begå indbrud, og det skal de venligst lade være med i fremtiden.

Forresten: Hvor mange venner er det du tror vi har, ifølge den statistik? Det er i retning af 1/200 der bliver voldtaget, og regnet med at voldtægtsforbrydere ofte voldtagere flere, er andelen af personer der voldtager langt lavere."

SoyBeanExplosion,ukpolitics,1388753762.0,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement#Permissible_government_restrictions

&gt;Governments may generally sharply restrict the freedom of movement of persons who have been convicted of crimes, most conspicuously in the context of imprisonment. Restrictions may also be placed on convicted criminals who are on probation or have been released on parole. Persons who have been charged with crimes and have been released on bail may also be prohibited from traveling. A material witness may also be denied the right to travel.

The UN doesn't have a problem with prison in regard to the right to movement. 

It's not clean-cut. You also don't have the right to movement on another person's private property. That doesn't mean you don't have the right to freedom of movement, it's just that you've misunderstood the specifics of what that right actually constitutes."

I would recommend trying some slightly better brands if you've only compared it to Magners and Bulmers though - those and the Stella cider aren't actually cider, they're artificially carbonated concentrated apple juice that's been slightly fermented. I have a cider loving flatmate who brings something new home every week - there are some very tasty ones out there. Green Goblin is probably my favourite, Aspall is good too though. In fact the only 'cheap' cider that's vaguely good is Thatcher's Gold, which is pretty tasty for something cheaper than Magners."

If you trust that she isn't going to cheat on you, why is it a big deal? It's possible for other people to get feelings for your gf, that doesn't mean she has to cut contact with people she likes just because of it. That would be a really bitchy thing to do.

But that's not what's going to happen. They're just going to suck up all available funds, nuclear fuel will run out too and then we'll have to deal with the nuclear legacy, a coal-stoked climate (because nuclear won't stop coal) and underinvestment in renewables.

mundabit,birthcontrol,1388755282.0,"I've had very few side effects, Without BC I suffer headaches, acne, facial hair, daily cramping, daily nausea/vomiting, irregular heavy frequent bleeding and difficulty shifting weight. My GYN was hoping Implanon would help. So far it has only effected bleeding, My periods are still irregular and  frequent, but they are much-much lighter, so light that when I got my first one I thought it was just spotting, I still think it is spotting, but according to the total fluid loss and medical definition its considered a light flow.

I had Implanon inserted while not on my period, My period was 2 months late so I just got the implant put in randomly in my cycle. 2 weeks later my period started, It lasted 90 days which is not unusual for me as it has done that without BC before. after that I had 2-3 weeks before I noticed spotting. During this time I gained a lot of weight, though I was also taking some anti-depressants which can cause weight gain too, I've lost half of it just by being more conscious of my appetite and what the medications are doing to it. My GYN told me to measure my fluid loss using a menstreal cup (I have vulvodynia so that was *not* fun) and she has told me that the numbers show a 96% improvement on bleeding where 100% would be amenorrhoea.

I'd say if you haven't had any crazy happening in the first few weeks its a good sign that you will have a good first year. One thing that my GYN said to me is that after a year or so sometimes your side effects change, if this is the case she recommends getting the implant out early and getting a new one put in that day, as the levels of hormones secreted daily can waver as the implant gets older. (It works as contraception for 3 years, but as Period/PMS management it can vary)

So overall my experiences are neutral. Implanon has altered my bleeding in a way I don't mind, There was weight gain but I have it under control now. I'm still planning to swap to another method because I have many personal symptoms I want managed and Implanon has not helped those.

&gt;What's your opinion? I personally don't think yelling is verbal abuse, unless it's unprovoked and constant.

To me, yelling at someone in anger, to belittle, to shame, or to hurt is likely emotional abuse. 

&gt;Do you think insults are acceptable when disguised as jokes?

No. I don't think people who are in a relationship should purposefully try to hurt each other mentally, physically, or emotionally. If there is intent to harm, even if disguised as a joke, then it is not ok to me.

&gt;When does it get taken too far?

When one partner is intentionally hurting the other partner, it is too far for me.

&gt;Is it ever ok to scream at each other?

I assume you mean in anger? To me, it is never really appropriate to scream at your partner in anger.

&gt;How would you handle the situation? Would you confront them head on with an ultimatum? Or would you stay and try to save the relationship?

At this point in my life, I would leave and end the relationship. I have been emotionally, mentally, and physically abused within the context of relationships before and am completely unwilling to deal with that ever again.

With a wide enough dispersal and a decent electricity network they can still provide a baseload. At that point, it will also become profitable to invest in energy storage research and facilities.

Gertiel,raisedbynarcissists,1388755342.0,"Yeah, I got that from my parents a lot. 

My dad grew up on a farm and had a lot of chores from a very young age. Especially early morning chores, at least to hear him tell it. Still, I know from other family he honestly did pretty much do a man's work on the farm + go to school from about 11-12 years old at least. Dad barely squeaked by with a lot of C's, as he would honestly own up to, but he did graduate high school. 

My nMum's bitching about my lazy habits is a bit harder to justify. She grew up in town and my grandparents did pretty well for themselves. I'm sure she did have chores as my grandparents raised me until I was six and kept me at any school holiday longer than a week up through elementary school. They started giving me chores to help out when I was quite young, but nothing terribly onerous. I'm pretty sure her chores were pretty similar in nature. Didn't stop her from being the biggest bitch to me about being lazy for as far back as I can recall.

Starting from 10 years old, I mowed lawns, washed cars, and babysat enough to pay for my own stuff. Yeah, the parents provided a roof over my head, and meals when I was home. From that time forward, just asking for a dime to give me enough to buy a school lunch would sent my nMum into a rant about my laziness and poor money management. God forbid I ask for any real cash to pay for school clothing or something like that. 

Somewhere in my 12th year, I started working an adult job in a machine shop. At 14, I started working in fast food. I found my W-2 covering my spring sophomore through fall junior year of high school recently. I was less than 150 hours short of working 40 hours every week for the entire year and a week off for my great-grandmother's funeral is included in those off hours. I still maintained nearly straight A's and ultimately graduated tenth in my class of 325 kids. My dad's only comment at my graduation was to look at the valedictorian and tell me, ""See there, if you'd really tried, that could be you"". 

The period that really chaps me the most is when I came home from college the first summer. I was working @ 50 hours per week second shift at a plastics plant which was the best job I could get. Thanks to a bit of a commute, I would leave around 3 in the afternoon and get back home anywhere from 2-3 am. If I happened to sleep past 8 am, my mother would start in. Dad backed her up because he's a great believer in you get up early if you want to get ahead in life. Thank god I had bought my own car by then. I took to telling my mother I was going to the library at the college in the next town over after breakfast at 8 am when I was really just going to finished sleeping in the hatchback parked in a shady area of a local lover's hang out. I just thank god we didn't have GPS tracking devices back then. I know my parents would have considered it their god-given right to slap one on my car.

All this to say: Don't let it get to you. I'm sure you can tell by reading how hard I worked I was not lazy. You aren't, either. Think back carefully to the times when you hear that rant. Is it really about you being lazy, or about you not doing something so dad can be lazy and not do it himself? Uh-huh! Bet that hit the nail on the head, didn't it?"

papermageling,MakeupAddiction,1388755373.0,"First, visit /r/SkincareAddiction, for tips for helping your skin. I personally use CeraVe in the pump bottle, because it's amazing on dry skin. 

You hopefully use sunscreen religiously? It's important for everyone, but the paler you are, the bigger the difference it makes. 

I'm can't tell from the picture exactly how pale you are. You're probably too pale to find a foundation match in the drugstore. The brands I've found to have great color ranges in the pale end are CoverFX and Shiseido, so I'd look at those. If you're more into shopping online, go to [Meow Cosmetics](http://www.meowcosmetics.com/). Powder sounds silly with dry skin, but it can actually work beautifully if you're well moisturized and have a good base underneath. CeraVe sunscreen makes my powder foundation stick amazingly well, and if I don't want to deal with the whiteness of that, I use Physicians Formula Mineral Primer.  Application of foundation gets interesting: I find that creams or powder look the most natural on me. Regardless, look at tutorials by Lisa Eldridge and Goss Makeupartist for help. 

It sounds like you might be looking for a more natural look, yes? Mascara is lovely, but you might want a brown/black for a less harsh look. Black might generally look a little harsh on you, so perhaps stick to brown or brown/black for more daytime looks. 

When you find that you want blush, I'd recommend NYX in Natural. For eyes, start experimenting with Wet and Wild, using NYX HD eye primer underneath. Wet and Wild has a palette called walking on eggshells that would be a great starting point for you. They're also cheap enough that if you want to try any wild colors, it's not an investment. "

HippoCampus22,AnimalCrossing,1388755608.0,"You got that spot on.  I grinded so hard when I first got the game, because that's what I was used to doing with other games.  I made lots of bells, got lots of stuff, and filled up my encyclopedia quickly.  But since this is my first Animal Crossing game, I didn't know that different town layouts existed, and that you could get different villagers.  So I went with the first layout and first villagers I got.  Then I discovered this sub, and found that there are *way* more options than that.  Now I'm constantly debating whether or not I want to reset or not.  After reading your comment, though, I might just do what you're doing and rehaul in the spring.

caffeinep0wered,PeopleBeingJerks,1388755619.0,"I don't swear on Reddit much, but seriously, what a cunt.

I spent some time on a farm when I was little and saw all manner of animals being slaughtered. YOU DO NOT try and knock pigs out, they are hardy little buggers. If you are slaughtering a pig you knock it out first, usually with a small dose of barbiturates, THEN you take the axe/chainsaw/method of death of your choosing.

If you are an unregulated, third world peasant farm with no access to veterinary medicine you use a god damned shotgun. Quick and mostly painless is the way to go. Halal slaughter (of beef etc) is even more barbaric since the animal is still alive for some time after its throat and windpipe has been cut (hence why I refuse to eat anywhere that serves halal meat).

That poor pig probably spent a good chunk of time dying of cerebral edema whilst being bludgeoned to death. Which is going to hurt, A LOT."

These guys are fed a diet of MMA and action movies and have probably seen enough violence to not consider death as a foreseeable outcome of their actions. Negligence and manslaughter require an act that a reasonable person would foresee as resulting in harm or death respectively and that is where we would see most of these charges ending up. I think the issue is cultural and we need to start demonstrating that a knock out is a dangerous as a stabbing not only in the news but on film and in the arena."

mundabit,ChronicPain,1388756328.0,"If I'm lucky, I will be asleep for my entire flare, For me it starts in the armpits, My lymph nodes swell and I can barely move my upper body, If I am able, I normally try to take a nap at this point, I know there is worse to come but the pain is tolerable enough to sleep. If I am lucky, I get a fatigue flare allong with a pain flare, My fatigue allows me to sleep through a lot of pain for a long amount of time, I have slept-unconsciously for 5 days in a row, Rousing often but never waking. It has scared my partner a lot when it first started happening, the paramedics were called often and nothing could wake me.

If I am unlucky there is no fatigue, only pain, which leads to insomnia, which in turn means I get an energy crash as soon as the pain-flare up ends. It starts in my armpits and spreads down my back to my groin, It feels like my internal organs are trying to burst through my skin. My abdominal pain increases to the point where I struggle to breathe, at this point all I can do is lie on the bed, If I happen to get a migraine, which I often will, it means lights out and no podcasts to listen too, so I just sit there for days alone with my thoughts, taking the few minutes of sleep here and there that I can. I experience almost every symptom I have ever come across at some point during the flare. Uncontrollable shakes, seizures, random bruising,yellowing and blueing of the skin, as well as the pain-type symptoms like allodynia, hypersensitivity, joint pain and flu-like muscle pain.

A level of my flares is mental, if a flare lasts more than a week (which it often does, my average is 5-10 days, every month or so) I start to get very depressed, My family and my partner get fed up with me about a week in, My Case worker gets annoyed that I haven't left the house to job hunt, I get annoyed that I am sitting in bed doing nothing, I start to wish I was dead, I feel useless and pathetic and Its not helped that my doctors say that there is nothing more that can be done other than the yoga, diets and alternative therapies I have been ding for the past 11 years."

jgagnon_in_FL,pathofexile,1388756355.0,"I totally understand the being nice angle, that works well when you are CLOSE to the same ballpark in price.

But when an item is worth 2 chaos, maybe 4 chaos IF I am feeling generous and someone thinks it is worth 20 chaos, those are worlds apart and unless the other guy is nice too you are not going to make a deal.

And by the way, saying **""no thanks""** when someone makes a ridiculous counter is plenty **nice** when you think the deal is dead.  Being rude would be **""you are high"" ""you are delusional"" ""no way bro""**.

Saying ""it's a little out of my budget"" is not getting the deal done for 2-4 chaos.  I ended up paying 2 chaos and 4 alchs for a similar roll in the end from a different buyer with no haggling.

Finally when you search by buy out, that is not an indication of what the item is going for, it is what people are asking.  I cannot stress this enough, anyone that uses eBay realizes that for some items there are 9-10 as many ""buy it now"" auctions that go unsold compared to auctions that sell at a (sometimes much) lesser price.

Here's another reaction I got:

    Him: Offer?
    Me: 2c + 6a
    Him: Do I look like Charlie Brown?
    Me: Yes.
    Him: Why?
    Me: Because you are over-valuing your item, there are 99+ on the server.

This is the problem with search tool, people see other people listing perfect rolls for 1 exalt and they think that is what people are PAYING for that item when in fact the reason why they see it in the results is because nobody is paying that price otherwise it would be sold already."

joethesaint,AskReddit,1388756404.0,"I think I'm one of the few people who very strongly supports full legalisation but has little desire to consume it himself. I guess that gives me somewhat of an unbiased view.

I do think it's not nearly harmful enough to warrant being illegal, and most importantly I think its legalisation would lift a big load off of our (the UK's) healthcare system and criminal justice system.

My opinion on the current goings-on is that Uruguay is largely acting as a guinea pig for the rest of the world, and if they can show that legalisation has wielded more pros than cons, I think there are plenty of politicians here who will consider that good enough evidence, and will vocalise their support for doing the same. We might have to wait a few years still, but I think any negative stigma attached to marijuana has been fading for some time, and all we need is a little bit of positive evidence to take that step towards legalisation."

Amonette2012,AskMen,1388756464.0,"I am a woman who stutters slightly (hope it's ok to comment) and I've never had a bad reaction to it from a date. I guess it helps that it is pretty slight, but it's more noticeable after even one drink. If I get stuck on a word I tend to just roll my eyes at myself, go 'blergh blergh blergh' to reset my mouth and have another go or change word. I've never had anyone even act like I've done anything unusual, and it sometimes gets an 'aw that's cute' smile. I'd never really considered it a handicap and I stutter more often than once every 30 minutes. However it's just on single words and I can usually work around it so maybe your stutter is less frequent but more noticeable than mine.

I think it helps to acknowledge that you're stuttering so that they also can, roll your eyes, laugh or make light of it in some way and then just carry on. I find that people get embarrassed because they don't know how they're supposed to react, so if you kind of let people know early on that it's bloody irritating for you and you see it as something you can laugh about and get past, they relax about it too."

And yet they're paying rock bottom interest rates on it. If you want to take the markets' judgment as key, they're saying ""please borrow more!"".

And?

&gt;What seems from the outside like 'austerity', isn't one. We are building more streets, more train tracks, more airports, more and more ... for a shrinking population.

Then why is the upkeep of existing infrastructure failing?

Much of the money is also flowing into the upgrade of our energy infrastructure. Already.

And you're going to have to spend much more. The grid will have to become more flexible, and Germany is in a central position in Europe..

So borrow from them so they get more stable income.

Jarkus86,changemyview,1388756589.0,"Australian here. The context here is a little different but I think black pride is important for a lot of the aboriginal people. Assimilation was a major part of Australia's history which is a contrast to the segregation seen in the US and South Africa (amongst many other countries) and there was a push towards genocide through breeding out rather than direct murder (although a lot of that happened too). The result was a real shame in being black that still exists today. 

Black pride here is not about taking credit for the race's achievements but about owning the culture and history of the people. There is still a lot of self-shame here that results in some real issues for the black youth and there is a real benefit to them taking pride and finding value in their racial identity.

 Black pride is about recognising the worth that you have by being a black person and taking ownership of the 40,000 year old culture and learnings. Culture, which often stems from racial background forms a part of the identity of the individual and self worth relies on the individual being proud of who they are.

 I think racial pride is not about equating self worth to the actions of their race, but recognising that your race forms part of who you are and until you can be proud of your race as well the other facets that form you as whole person, you cannot be truly proud of yourself."

If you have no problems censoring someone who is expressing his honest opinion on censorship, that makes you an enormous hypocrite. End of story."

tmbyfc,todayilearned,1388756801.0,"Obviously I think they're idiots. Parents who refuse all vaccinations are endangering the health and in some cases the lives of their children, and also of the children in their community who have been vaccinated. Vaccines generally provide slightly less than 100% protection, so herd immunity is essential to prevent infection. If they reject MMR on the basis of Wakefield that is bad enough, because his paper has been completely discredited and withdrawn by the Lancet. If they choose to reject *all* vaccinations based on Wakefield then they are imbeciles, because you might as well refuse to travel by bus on the basis that some people think plane travel is dangerous (it's actually statistically very safe). But most people down this road are impervious to facts. It's nigh on impossible to reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into.

Having said that, I've argued with a lot of anti-vaxxers in my time and it is unusual for Wakefield to be used as justification for anything other than rejection of MMR. You're far more likely to hear scare stories about mercury, formaldehyde, dead cow embryos, or the assertion that we don't need it, or that diet is more effective, or people need to catch these diseases in order to build an immune system, or it's all about doctors making money or any of the other endless supply of fairy stories.

My mom started dating my dad at 21 (as old as I am now), my dad proposed when she was 24, they were married by 26, and she had their firstborn at 30 (and from what I know from other friends, this would be considered having kids later in the game). Obviously I don't have to adhere to this deadline or chain of events at these markers, but it's scary to think about. I'm not ready to be proposed to in 3 years...and it's just weird. Like, I know people who are 25 and 26. I'm getting to that age where it's not so weird to be getting proposed to and having babies now.

I have low interest in having kids. Maybe that will change, maybe it won't.

Honestly, I own both, and they both work great. Have tested both with calibrated weights, and they are accurate to the mg at 500mg. The former looks much cheaper than the picture (it's basically all cheap plastic), the latter is stainless steel, and is nice enough looking that you can leave it on the counter of your custom kitchen without upsetting your spouse. If they were the same price, I'd recommend the stainless steel over the plastic, but from a functionality standpoint they are the same. With the stainless steel being half the price of the plastic, I guarantee you'd feed like you got ripped off if you bought the plastic one and saw them both side by side. 

The only exception would be if you need to carry it with you. The plastic one is small and weighs maybe 8 oz. the stainless steel one is designed to live on a countertop, is significantly larger and probably a pound and a half or so in weight.

jgagnon_in_FL,pathofexile,1388757218.0,"The problem is inflated prices are self-perpetuating.  You are not paying market price when you only buy this way.  You are paying what people are asking.  When there are 99+ uniques on a server there is absolutely no reason to pay 20 chaos on a mid-roll item.

For example there are TWO listed right now for people that are online for Nemesis with buyouts.

Option 1: 30% trap damage (absolute worst roll), buyout = 11 chaos - I would not pay more than 1 chaos for the worst roll, since I know there are over a hundred other sellers.

Option 2: 38% trap damage (40% is best roll), buyout = 1 exalt

If a best roll trap belt is SELLING for 1 exalt (which we don't even know) then what is this 38% trap belt worth?  Regardless 1 exalt is way out of my budget so I wouldn't even bother trying to haggle with this gentleman. FTR there are 16 listed with 38+ trap damage and 5 with perfect rolls.

I just don't get the value for a perfect roll either, you can get +9% trap damage with 1 node on the passive tree, that is like someone saying 12% resist all is worth 1 exalt."

Stuff like that should not be easily found on the web and in a perfect world, obviously not at all.

Megaross,drunk,1388757485.0,"No it isn't, it's your body preventing alcohol poisoning when you puke when you're drunk.

When you get a hangover that is because your body is dehydrated (cause of many symptoms including swollen blood vessels in the brain resulting in headaches and dizziness), drained of electrolytes and you've converted the alcohol into acetaldehyde which is a poison, your body slowly processes it expending an enormous amount of energy which compounds the problem making you tired. That is completely different to alcohol poisoning, mild alcohol poisoning might make your hangover worse but it isn't the sole cause of hangovers.

Come back when you've grown some pubes kid, in my day we'd just put this guy on his front in the shed and let him sober up - no one had any issue with it they just walked in at 6am looking sheepish as hell and cleaned themselves up, serious alcohol poisoning is more of a case of ""holy shit his heart is beating really slowly and he's turning blue"" at which point you phone the ambulance, but to achieve that level of drunkeness at which your body won't reject enough alcohol through vomiting, that takes some doing.

And bad language is sort of an opinion. I'm not sure if swear words were held to the same scrutiny as they are now or in the 50's as they were hundreds of years ago. Plus you have to look at what kind of society is reflecting these rules because the things usually stopping people from doing them is an over-abundant and possibly Machiavellian ruler-ship. 

Also, television shows used to be a lot more heavily censored than they are now as well so it's not that television was reflecting a more innocent time, it was shanghaied into being more G-rated by the FCC.

A prime example I use is of a guy I worked with.  He was xenophobic and bigoted; basically the stereotypical Southern Redneck from the US that you'd see in movies.  He went to work in Saudi Arabia on a drilling contract during the drilling moratorium in 2010-2011.  After working with the native Saudis and seeing how they lived and how their culture really was, his perspective changed completely.  He told me a story of how he tried taking out a couple hundred dollars at an ATM and it didn't work so he left.  A few minutes later a guy was running down the street after him to let him know that everyone in line wouldn't move forward until he got his money.  That blew him away, that these people were just normal, good people.

In my perspective, it was really sad that it took until he was 55 years old to realize that, but was glad that he finally did.  One less bigot in the world.  Sure, some people use their travel as a way to set themselves above others, but for most I think that it is just that they want to see the world."

For full disclosure (not to scare you!) I ended up bleeding for about 3-4 weeks, a somewhat steady but very light flow, sometimes brown, sometimes pink and one heart stopping day right after my first vaginal ultrasound bright red! I am still not 100% on the cause but, for me, it was likely due to endometriosis (which I can't spell) and tissue dying outside my baby as my little turtle was fine. 

FWIW I kept in touch with my doc, talking to the nurses almost every day (they were awesome), was put on pelvic rest (no sex, no penetration, no lifting over 20lbs) until I didn't bleed for one whole week (which was around week 10??) and I got two early ultrasounds out of it, to check on the turtle. 

If you get ultrasounds know that the earlier it is the less you are likely to see anything including a heartbeat and that is NORMAL, I had my first at just over 7 weeks and mostly the baby looked like a C but did have the most fantastic of heartbeats, the next I had a 10 when s/he actually looked like a person. I am not 18 weeks and looking forward to an anatomy scan soon

TL:DR Talk to your doc, but this is NOT a *definite* miscarriage so try to remain calm and think positively. Early bleeding has many reason so breathe deep kay? "

counteraxe,Accounting,1388757775.0,"First off, I work for the State of CA, application processes very by state. That being said, the basic process for a job with the state is first you take an exam to get placed on an 'eligible list' for whatever classification you are looking for. You must be in the top three ranks to be eligible for hire. The exams are fairly easy, however due to veterans preferences and other extra points available it can be hard to get to top three ranks. My classification at hire was 'Auditor I'.

After you are list eligible you can begin n applying for positions in that classification. The interview process is dependent on department/hiring manager, but expect to be asked about your general education and prior work experience, how you work with people, what if situations, etc. Also expect a few accounting questions, generally one theoretical and one easy computational. If your offered the position be patient, the state hiring process/hr can be painfully slow (at last my department is...).

Your work will depend on what department/unit you're hired for. For me, I audit health care programs for Medicaid. Expect a lot of job specific training as generally we audit specific programs/services and you need to know how the laws and regulations around those programs work. Honestly what we do is vastly different than a public accountant. We still follow an audit program/write work papers and assemble audit packages, but we are testing how information is included in cost reports and  reconciling payments. Also, the providers can, and do, appeal our findings so we have to defend our findings in administrative hearings and court.

 For my position we are on site for about a week ever month to two months. The rest of the time I work from the office or from home (teleworking two days a week, but that isn't common in most departments). I work a 40 hour week 90% of the time. Sometimes deadlines hit hard, but nothing like public.

Pay is much less then public, but so is stress and I think I have a much better work life balance than my friends in public. Also benefits are much better than public. Also pay starts out very low however there are 'step' increases you get from being in the classification each year until you max out. Also there are two more classifications in the general audit series, so expect to get raises/promotions for your first 5 years or so.

I passed the CPA exam while working full time at my current job. I am now waiting on my sign off. Make sure when you apply to ask them about CPA work experience. Honestly most people I work with aren't CPAs, including my supervisor. My department has an agreement with our board of accountancy to be able to get signed off without a direct supervisor CPA. However, the process is a pain in the butt because you must submit 500 audit hours in a broad range of programs we audit to the CPA internal committee for review. Which means your boss has to allow you to take work load from other teams with programs you've never really touched before and you do the highest level review on those.... For example I mostly audit county programs, but I had do do a hospital on my own, usually even if you do the hospital audits you are assisting a senior for at least two/three years before doing your own..."

The Vedic religions were practiced a little further out in other kingdoms within India. Gautama Buddha would surely have known and encountered them across his travels, but he certainly wasn't trying to respond to them. India at that time was rife with spiritual and philosophical debate and discourse. He was doing his own thing and defended against Vedic lines of thought just as much as nihilist philosophers, atheists, etc. "

I know we can count on professionalism from our firefighters and police officers, but it pains me to say that we cannot expect the same from grunts. I'm not saying that ground pounders are stupid, but they're definitely more prone to idiotic acts than POGs. 

Let's say I have one gay guy in my platoon, and another that's kinda into that kind of stuff. If Gunny catches them, it's two problems for me, but I can deal with that. Since there are statistically less gay men than women overall, especially in the military, this isn't really a problem. 

Now, if I have women in the mix, that's much more work for me if I catch them going at it with fellow Marines. If you say that it won't happen because they know they'll get disciplined, you're wrong because they're stupid.

seanomenon,stopdrinking,1388757992.0,"It's tough, and its a situation that doesn't necessarily go away after college. It does decrease as you get older, because healthy drinkers tend to take it a lot easier when they get into their 30s and 40s. What's healthy drinking, what's unhealthy, what is binge drinking and what is alcoholism? The lines are blurry. It doesn't help that people throw around the word ""alcoholic"" as a joking insult, but then act like an actual sober alcoholic is some bizarre and fragile creature. Sometimes I want to explain that it takes courage and strength to quit drinking, that a sober person feels like a sane person in a crowd of fools sometimes. 

I dislike a lot of the sing-songy slogans in AA, but there are a few sayings that have stuck with me and helped me. One of them is ""clean up your side of the street."" When I first heard it, I thought it meant ""mind your own business."" But I've come to understand it a little differently. Now I take it to mean ""focus on what you can control"". The thing is that the world will not stop drinking. People love alcohol, it is our culture's drug of choice, and our society goes to great lengths to permit it and condone it. I can't change that, and it would be frustrating and fruitless to try. I can work to build and maintain the peaceful sober life I want to have, and that is difficult enough. 

I don't think you are trying to get other people to quit, but my point is that it is frustrating and somewhat pointless to put your energy towards other people's drinking. You only have a finite amount of mental energy, use it to work on being the best you can be. 

Another thing I also have trouble communicating - I think the *quality* of an alcoholic's drinking is different, and people recognize that out-of-control quality when they see it. In other words, it isn't necessarily *how much* one drinks or *how often*, it is becoming a different person when the drink passes your lips. This may be what other people saw in you. It also could be the game of pointing out someone worse to make yourself feel better. ""I drank way too much last weekend, but at least I wasn't like catcoma!"" This is a very common occurrence, a lot of alcoholics have found some of the people who criticized them most vocally are asking if you're sure you need to quit, and ""aren't you overreacting?"" Maybe because they are suddenly the worst drunk in the crowd instead of second-worst. Of course, now I'm doing exactly what I shouldn't - time to sweep up my side of the street again.

You know you needed to quit, you know your life is better since quitting. You also know how tricky alcohol can be. Don't worry about everyone else and focus on being an awesome sober you.

Have you looked into sober dorms or floors at your college? My university had them, it might make your daily life a lot simpler.

Take care."

funkb0mb,askscience,1388758101.0,"The observation issue has nothing to do with human conciousness. Nothing at all.

In order to observe something, you have to throw something at it and see how it bounces off. Sometimes this has an insignificant effect on the object such as light refracting of something that your eyes can see, or radio waves bouncing an air plane.
When observing very small things like atoms however, you have to throw an electron or neutron at it. But since such a process will either fissure, modify, or displace the atom, all you can say is ""The atom WAS there."" 
So that's how observation will affect the subatomic object. A person doesn't have to see the results and it has nothing to do with human conciousness.
The conundrum is that before throwing a particle at an atom you can say ""the atom is probably there,"" and after you can say ""There was indeed an atom there, but not any more."""

NDaveT,DebateAnAtheist,1388758583.0,"&gt; Then bring it forth, let us have a review of this scientific definition of love.

Here you go: http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/oxytocin

&gt; Alternatively, you admit that not all of human experience is bounded through the scientific method...

I never claimed it was. Everything in the human experience has a scientific explanation. We don't use the scientific method to form our personal preferences or come up with values or emotions.

&gt; And there is no universal definition. That is the whole point you are willfully ignoring. You have in your mind knowledge of what justice is for you. 

Yes. That's because justice is a human construct based on personal preference and personal values. That's why opinions on justice aren't knowledge; they are opinions.

&gt;&gt; Your argument would be that it's irrational to use personal choices to determine whether something exists.
&gt; 
&gt; Except for personal matters. 

Personal matters aren't questions about whether something exists.


&gt;Your strawman, not mine or the OP.

The topic of the thread is not a straw man. The topic of the OP is ""Is there necessarily a trade off between science and all kinds of gods?""

&gt; (Hint, you have and hold other values besides the scientific method)

As I acknowledged from the start.

&gt; First, Buddhist and Pantheist escape your reasoning entirely.

No, they don't. Buddhism and pantheism both involve beliefs about reality external to human preferences and values. 

&gt; And I don't, at first, have much of a way to separate his notion of ""I love my wife"" from ""I feel there is something watching over me""

Yes, you do. Something watching over you is something external to you. If it exists, there should be scientific evidence that it does. 

Theists don't just claim that they feel something is watching over them - they claim it exists.

&gt; Nor does he need to justify either on scientific ground once he has admitted that his epistemic is fundamentally non-scientific. 

Once he has admitted that, he has admitted that his belief is irrational. 

&gt; I feel that way about that type theism, the one that is solely in the personal realm.

No such theism exists. All theistic beliefs posit a god that exists outside of the human mind.

&gt; My love for my wife does exist. And it isn't based on the scientific method. 

But the existence of your wife is based on the scientific method. Your love is a feeling, not knowledge. Your knowledge about that feeling is based on the scientific method.

See, I probably got one point here predicting possible language problems. Just tell him something along the lines that he shouldn't get upset because of the language and be free to ask to repeat and rephrase every time he wants. Comforting like that should give enough confidence for him not to be stressed at least about the language.

Poland was quite homophobic (when compared to the west) but it changes every year and the whole country becomes more liberal. I think whole homophobia comes from being afraid of people who may appear different than others and as only very few officially were ""different"" people didn't personally know them. The first time you meet different people, like foreigners or with other sexual orientation and see they are exactly the same then all that stuff of being afraid slowly moves away. Education and other things are obviously important as well.

I think I was less tolerant when in Poland (I mean I was pretty tolerant and liberal then anyway) but became even more liberal after the stay here. This was simply because we weren't thought enough and told off about tolerance - partly because of the Church. Now, when even the Pope says something like ""it's not me to judge and all should be equal"" it certainly helps a lot (especially to those really religious)."

Otherwise you end up sounding like an antivaxxer, using anecdote or hyperbole or pulling numbers out of thin air that have nothing to back them up. The truth is that as vaccination rates fell, incidence of measles etc rose sharply. But in the western world measles has a very low mortality rate, so actually there wasn't a very big increase in deaths. You said 100s. This doesn't mean that Wakefield wasn't a disaster for human health (he was), or that measles isn't a horrible disease (it is), or that *some* people died who might not have otherwise (they did).

There are many excellent arguments to deploy against Wakefield and against the anti-vaccination crowd, because they are backed up by evidence. Science is best served by sticking to those. I'm not having a go at you or saying you are wrong-headed, I'm just saying tighten up your arguments because that is how you prove the dickheads wrong."

&gt;NO! At first glance we may look similar due to the size of the board and the use of coins. But the game play is 100% different. It's like comparing Monopoly with the Game of Life. Just because a game is played on a board and uses dice doesn't mean it's the same as the rest. 

seems somewhat possible if unlikely

&gt;The main inspiration for Wallet Battles comes from an old Civil War coin flipping game... with a mix of an Australian gambling game called Two-Up. In Coin Age you shake and slap the coins, while in Wallet Battles you flip two coins (one by you and one by your opponent). The maps in Coin Age are fantasy maps while we have real battlefield maps of the American Civil War. 

That last sentence is stupid. The mechanic sounds... i guess different but still obviously inspired by the success of coin age no matter what they say about ""two-Up""

&gt;Some of the inspiration for this game also came from our deck of Bicycle playing cards we produce, Civil Unrest (see Add-Ons). With Civil Unrest we used battlefield maps of the American Civil War in the background of the cards. This was done long before Coin Age was ever launched.

&gt;this paragraph means nothing. ""We make playing cards first so obviously our coin game is different?"" Am i reading that right?

====

----

&gt;After the war ended many Confederates said that the South would rise again. Now with the help of Wallet Battles their dream can come true.

I'm not really sure but it sorta leaves a sour taste when you advertise a game like that. It's like advertising a WW2 game as ""Play the game where the Nazis can take over the world"". Yeah it's true but that's not really the selling point. But hey maybe that's just me being over sensitive.

----

If you want to sorta clone the game then clone the game say you were inspired by the success of coin age. It's really not *that* big a deal IMO.  Especially if the mechanics are different as they appear to be. But trying to say in paragraph one that `We are not affiliated with Coin Age` that just sounds false. As a microgame the chances of two people this far apart designing so similar games is pretty slim. It's hard to believe that they've been developing it since before the coin age kickstarter while at the same time being aware of the coin age kickstarter"

Crime? fucking aboriginals
poverty? aboriginals
neglectful parents? aboriginals

these things have been brought to my attention for no apparent reason... 

also they are way overdoing it on the aboriginal themes in every day cultural settings. I think they make some street art or a sculpture/statue and then look at it and say to themselves ""this is now a part of OUR culture - we are equal"" like they are kidding themselves or something. 

I think this place is great and the people are cool and really friendly (mostly) but this thing with the aboriginals is just too recent a thing and there is still so much denial here."

But even leaving the issue of the usefulness of their actual work aside, why should they be rewarded *that* much?

JaminSousaphone,soccer,1388759610.0,"Blackburn was a former mill town, had plenty going for it. Not in the sense that it was a booming economy like a city but it was well off given its location, surroundings, population and of course what it produced. 
Lately (the past 10-15 years) Rovers have gradually declined as a team (despite this image stating otherwise) we have only won one cup and a second place Championship spot last time we got promoted. Basically the football glory has dried up, that is after the mill production and what not the town has. Basically i'm trying to paint a picture here of Blackburn Rovers being a team that inspires a town, just like many others. I assume you have some affiliation with Blackburn otherwise I’ll just assume you're interested in what I have to say for myself.

Blackburn as a town is very small, a lot of friends and people I meet from out of town assume it's a city more often than not, why? Because of the football teams history and its manufacturing history (also a lot to do with Jack Straw surprisingly) so people assume that it's a big town up norf that's got a lot going for it. Let me tell you what, it hasn't. In the past decade we have reached the top of the tables for youth unemployment, youth pregnancies and of course lowest life expectancy. And bare in mind these are all across the buses and on billboards to make the townsfolk aware of how shit they have it.

Now to the Venkys. The Venkys took over Rovers when we were in a positive position, mid table doing well good average PL starting 11, enough to do the job of securing a mid table steady finish. But then along come a bunch of un-intelligent business men and woman who think they can take over the world with their brand through a small working class towns football team. They saw the history of Blackburn, they didn't stop for one second to look at the future. They fucked up and ran a club into the ground. A club where every weekend (given it's a home fixture) over 10% of the towns population turn up to watch them play. And not just watch them play, they show their support and dissatisfaction too. My father grew up following Rovers and he's your classic Northern man, doesn't show any emotion until the Rovers are playing. The state of the club as absurd as it may be to hear has greatly affected the town, businesses and pubs have closed down around the park and nothing is replacing them. Ewood is slowly turning into broken window syndrome typle place where one smashed window leads to another and another before you have a shell of what once remained. 

The attitudes of people from Blackburn represent the state of the football club. I task you to find one person to talk about Blackburn who will steer clear of any football conversation, not because football is in everyones blood, but that everyones blood is in our football. Regardless of whether or not you're a rugby man, a hockey man, a cricket man or whatever you'll find someone who has a relation to Rovers, whether or not it's because they used to work there or know a member of the board or even a member of the youth squad, at some point every person in Blackburn (I know that's not 100% true but I am confident enough to say it, regardless) has been to a Blackburn Rovers game at Ewood park. Match day would make the town come alive and now, well you've got a population of 100,000 depressed sods working and living in a town which has nothing to give the world when it once did and has a football team that is fighting to survive against its fans and local press let alone the other teams they play against. 

TL;DR: The once great town of Blackburn has had its football team taken over by owners who know nothing of the town, it's people and it's passion only a few facts from its history. They have subsequently run the club into the ground through countless bad decisions and ignorance to listen to the public which has resulted in a town becoming sorely depressed and spiteful towards the club and town that holds a place in pretty much every citizens heart. The town as a hivemind has begun to slump into a depression and it can easily be linked (socially and economically) to the decline of the local football club.

revolut1onname,AskReddit,1388759788.0,"Liverpool fan here, May 25th 2005.

Champions League final.

Here was the match we'd been working towards all season. I told my parents I was not to be disturbed, turned my phone onto silent, and waited. It wasn't long before my head was in my hands. 1-0 down that early? Oh dear.

It got worse. Over the next 45 minutes I watched AC decimate our defense, and go into the break, a deserving 3-0 up. I got a text off my brother, simply saying 'Have faith'. It's pretty bloody hard at that point in time.

The second half begins, and something has changed. It's like we're an entirely different team to the one from the first half. We'd only made one substitute, but it seemed to make the world of difference. 9 minutes later, Stevie G jumps, and scores a cracking header. 3-1 2 minutes later, Vladimir Smicer hits the ball low and hard, into the back of the net, 3-2.

4 minutes later, Stevie G is taken down in the oppositions box, PENALTY! Millions of fans around the country are glued to the set. Xabi Alonso takes his run up...and it's saved! Wait, he's not held onto it, it's 3-3!

The rest of the game is almost a blur, I was in shock. Eventually it comes to extra time, then penalties. By this point I'd had my heart going a million beats per minute for about an hour, and it was killing me. During the penalty shootout, I had to mute it for a few seconds, just to gather myself.

Finally, Andriy Shevchenko, arguably the best striker in the world, lines up to take his penalty. Jerzy Dudek dives, but manages to save the ball with his foot. We've won it! We've just had the most extraordinary game of football I've ever seen, and now we're European champions once again!"

feedmahfish,askscience,1388759929.0,"Don't think of them having equalized pressure as some super ability.  The pressure itself is just a consequence of the environment they group up in.  In basic physics, every force has an equal and opposite one.  We don't explode because our inner pressure pushing outward is just the same as it is on the outside.  Likewise, we aren't crushed by atmospheric pressure (which is pretty heavy, mind you).  

The inner pressure sources from their own bodily functions and products produced by metabolism and the fishes' physical structure.   For example:  our body keeps pressure in it much like a balloon keeps pressure in it, except in the balloon's case it's inner pressure exceeds the outside pressure and inflates.  Air rushes down to fill our lungs because the diaphragm makes a pressure differential.  

In deep sea fish, the pressure of the body is simply just a product of the fish using water and gasses.  Gasses are compressible, which is why their gas bladders tend to be much smaller and reduced, but they take a LOT in due to the compressed nature.  Thus, [this happens when they are pulled up](http://www.mesa.edu.au/deep_sea/images/swimbladder.jpg).  Gruesome.  

Liquids are very, very incompressible.  So you can put a lot of pressure on them without any problems, really.  This is why deep sea fish skeletons, on the whole, are reduced.  Less solid structure to compress, more pressure can be put on the liquid structure of the fish.

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1388760277.0,"&gt; Implementation will be hard as those on welfare who will be worse off under a big change will be unlikely to support it.

Even if they see a reduction in benefits, which they may if they have lots of children if they're not covered, I'd argue it's better than the status quo in the sense that it's permanent. I mean, welfare has work requirements, time requirements, etc., and once you're off, unless you find a job you're screwed. 

&gt;Despite what right-wingers might say about size of government their more visceral hatred of welfare recipients will lead them to reject it as well because it will give some people more money - ""derp derp something for nothing, wasteful taxation theft herp derp"".

This is why the idea seems extreme, and why it likely won't be implemented. You know, we actually fooled around with ideas like this back in the 60s, but ended up passing our current mess of welfare mainly for that reason (that and the only basic income study in the US I know of also indicated that it led to an increase of divorce which was seen as this bad thing back in the 60s and 70s....who knew giving women an unconditional income liberated them?). I mean, people want income to be tied to labor based on principle, and largely on principle, despite there being little evidence of it significantly reducing productivity.

I'm more worried about the right wingers shooting it down than the left. I mean, I'm sure the left have concerns, but I think that ultimately, they will see reason. It's the right wing I'm worried about, because they often vote based on principle and NOT reason. Between the ""taxation is theft"" crap and communism strawmen and their high and mighty protestant work ethic ideals, some of which has even affected the left (last I looked the democratic party is pretty conservative), I think the biggest problems come from right wing ideology, not left. As I mentioned, the big problem with the left nowadays is they're too conservative.

Dismantlement,changemyview,1388760378.0,"One concrete example is that white people, especially in majority-white nations, don't have any reason to feel ashamed, inferior, or depressed *because of their race*. And if you don't believe me, check out this recent study on race relations in children: http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/05/13/expanded_results_methods_cnn.pdf

They gathered several dozen white and black kids from NY and Atlanta, showed them cartoon pictures of five identical children who only varied in their skin tone, and asked them a series of questions varying on the theme of ""which child is good?"" and ""which child is bad?"". Here are the results from one question:

&gt;Show me the child who has the skin color you want as your own - the differences in
frequency counts WERE NOT statistically significant

&gt; a) Two darkest skin tones

&gt;i) Black children - 30.56% (n=11)

&gt;ii) Whitechildren-24.14%(n=7) 

&gt;b) Middle skin tone

&gt;i) Black children - 22.22% (n=8)

&gt;ii) Whitechildren-10.34%(n=3) 

&gt;c) Two lightest skin tones

&gt;i) Black children - 47.22% (n=17)

&gt;ii) Whitechildren-65.52%(n=19)

The children answering this question had a mean age of *5.21 years.* By 5 years of age, kids have picked up on the way society treats race and have figured out that being white is advantageous. For the white kids, this is something of a self-esteem boost, as 65% of them would keep their skin color if given a choice (or re-up every year, as Louis C.K. put it), while nearly half the black kids would choose to become white if given the choice. 

The results are even more strikingly clear when the corollary question was asked:

&gt;Show me the child who has the skin color you don't want- the differences in frequency counts WERE statistically significant

&gt;a) Two darkest skin tones

&gt;i) Black children - 51.43% (n=18) 

&gt;ii) Whitechildren-85.71%(n=24)

&gt;b) Middle skin tone

&gt;i) Black children - 0% (n=0)

&gt;ii) Whitechildren-10.71%(n=3)

&gt;c) Two lightest skin tones

&gt;i) Black children - 48.57% (n=17) 

&gt;ii) Whitechildren-3.57%(n=1)

The message is that white kids generally grow up with positive feelings about their race, and for black kids, the opposite. Now we can try to find anecdotes that don't conform to either generalization but whenever data is scientifically collected (and this study only corroborates the data from practically every other study on this topic), those trends hold true. That's why it's contextually much different for a black or white person to claim to be proud of belonging to their race."

PotRoastPotato,nfl,1388760389.0,"Good. It's not just Green Bay going at 8-7-1 over a team that won two more games than them -- this crap happens every year and it needs to end. I absolutely HATE that it was plausible 8-8 Pittsburgh would have made the playoffs while 11-5 Arizona stayed home, and I somewhat root for Pittsburgh -- it doesn't change the fact that it's not fair.  

Off the top of my head, I can think of three teams getting absolutely screwed just by the home-field advantage aspect, feel free to correct my facts:

* 11-5 New Orleans went to 7-9 Seattle and lost
* 12-4 Pittsburgh went to 8-8 Denver and lost (partially as a direct result of Ryan Clark not being able to play in the altitude)
* 11-5 Jacksonville went to 9-7 New England and lost

The 12 best records never make it into the playoffs and this needs to change.

And at least one (if not both) of the top wildcards is always better than one of the #4 seed division champs. Always.

What about seasons where the #1 seed is 14-2 and the #2 seed is 13-3? This has happened before. You are brain damaged if you think the 13-3 team should play on the road in the first round because some 9-7 team won it's weak division. "

As for the actual figures, [this article](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=549&amp;nID=49178&amp;NewsCatID=430) has a decent explanation of why quoting raw numbers before inflation and exchange rates are taken into account isn't saying much even if they've tripled (or quadrupled).

You would call a business person who continued to exist under a restrictive contact with another interest a fool if he or she accepted continued breaches of the terms of the agreement without attempting to exit the contact. If your business partner continually goes outside of the legally recognized relationship to attain the goods and services you are meant to have an exclusive right to provide and/or harasses you until the partnership is no longer conducive to your own interests then you will consult your lawyers in order to figure out a way for you to legally exit the relationship. 

Perhaps something about men (higher testosterone, social mores that differ, etc.) creates a higher likelihood that they will violate the terms of the agreement and thereby necessitate their partner's cancelation of the contact entirely? That is just as much baseless speculation as is putting a negative value judgment against women based on that singular statistic of higher filing for divorce rates.

You would have to do a study of the exact reasoning behind all divorces to make a negative judgment on the fact that women file for divorce at a slightly higher rate than men. Were the men in full compliance with the terms of the marriage? Were they acting in good faith and maintaining a collegial relationship with their partner? You just don't know that and can't assume that all the women filling for divorce are the sole party in breach of the agreement. They can very possibly be attempting to salvage their own interests in the face of prolonged and chronic misbehavior or lack of delivery on the part of their contractual partner. 

You wouldn't condemn a businessman for canceling an exclusive agreement with a sprocket manufacturer whose product was rarely delivered on time, had massive defects when it was provided and who had been secretly selling sprockets of a better quality to other businesses they had no contract with while claiming the resources available for sprocket manufacture  were not sufficient for their sprockets to be reliably and regularly supplied to this man's business.  You would call him a sucker if he kept trying to work this out with such a crappy and unethical business when there are ethical sprocket manufacturers all over the place who won't breach the contract and who are excited to have his business. 

Of course its definitely possible that the businessman might also breach the contract with a perfectly good sprocket manufacturer who is fulfilling their obligations, but you won't know what that statistic even means unless you can confirm the reasons behind the legal motion to end the agreement in all the cases that add up to make that figure. This divorce statistic is the exact same sort of situation. Each divorce will be caused by a unique set of circumstances and you would need to dig very deeply into the topic before you could begin to understand why there is a slightly higher rate for women filing for divorce.

Trepanated,vim,1388760668.0,"I do like the one that shrayas and Mihasi have linked.  But you can work a lot of it out by yourself just by thinking like a vimmer about it.  

1. You can tell a text object is coming because it's preceded by either ""a"" (for ""around"", which includes the delimiting characters) or ""i"" (for ""inside"", which excludes the delimiters).  

2. A text object delimited by a single character, like quotes, parentheses, brackets, etc., is signified by that character.  If the opening and closing characters are different, as is the case with brackets, you can use either.

3.  Constructs longer than a single character, like tags in a markup languge (""&lt;foo&gt;bar&lt;/foo&gt;""), usually get a single character that makes sense for the construct.  For tags, it's t.  Paragraphs:  p.  Sentences:  s.  Words:  w.  Easy!

These facts combine in intuitive ways, so you shouldn't think of memorizing every possible individual combination.  If you know that ""ci["" is ""change the text inside the brackets, leaving the brackets themselves"" then you should easily be able to intuit that ""da'"" means ""delete the text inside the single quotes, including the quote characters themselves"".

Once you are thinking this way, you might soon discover that you want additional text objects that don't come with stock vim.  There are probably plugins for that.  That tutorial the others mentioned gives the example of function arguments and the VimTextObj plugin; I use that one all the time.  And you shouldn't be surprised to learn that you can use it by typing ""a"" (for ""argument""), e.g. ""daa"" to delete around an argument.  You already know ""d"" means delete.  You already know the first ""a"" means around, and that a text object is coming.  You may not have known how to select the argument, but based on what you do know you should realize that ""a"" would be a good (and correct) guess.

If you were trying to learn this without understanding text objects, because some blog told you that you really need this plugin, it would be expensive.  You'd need effort to memorize the 3 character sequence and exactly what it did.  You'd forget to use it even when the opportunity arose.  And vim would seem hard to learn.  But it's not hard to learn if you train yourself to think in terms of text objects.  It's cheap because it all makes sense.  "

Google Voice, stock android Messaging, and the Google Play Store have dark action bars, and the colored actionbars in play that I mentioned... well, they're in Play, too. The Play Store and all of its friends.

&gt; This means I won't and will never try to do strange non-standard UI things like odd pull-to-refresh animations.

Okay, fair enough, but the actionbar was kind of my main idea, and Google Play, AOSP Contacts, Twitter, Snapchat, Paypal and more are using colored action bar quite well (even if not all quite in line with the Android guidelines). Even if it isn't the *standard*, it isn't *strange* or far from the norm at all. Actually, I think the main reason Google doesn't do it elsewhere is just that they're trying to maximize the value of the non-Software services of the Play Store, and to avoid confusion between those and the rest of their suite.

Chicken leg quarters are great.  Pile them into a big pot and add water to cover.  Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours.  This will give you chicken stock as well as lots of cooked meat for making your own chicken pot pie, chicken and dumplings, chicken tetrazzini, etc.  I usually measure the cooked chicken into 2-cup portions and put it in ziploc bags in the freezer.

About the making your own bread comment above:

Homemade bread not only tastes better but it's also much more filling than the airy store bought stuff.  Aside from being more work, the only negative is that it tends to spoil faster because it's more natural, so only make one loaf at a time...or if you make more than one, double bag and freeze the other until you're ready for it.

With the short grocery list above, you could make:


* Beans and rice

* Curried lentils and rice

* Potato and egg hash

* Eggs and hash browns

* pancakes with fried apples

* waffles with applesauce

* french toast with baked apples

* chili and cornbread

* burgers with homemade fries

* loaded baked potatoes

* Potato slice nachos

* homemade pasta with sauce

* gnocchi with sauce

* Potato soup with rolls

* Roast chicken and mashed potatoes

* Quiche and Swedish apple cake

* Fried chicken and popovers

* Butterbeans and cornbread

* Chicken in gravy served with grits

* homemade hummus and naan

bigt252002,wildhockey,1388760910.0,"I can only speak for myself on observations (and it is long): 

The main reason the team is collapsing is while they have a pretty sufficient Top 6, the bottom 6 have not been able to fill the void. The issue with Yeo's system (and also Richards) is it is developed to be like CHI or LAK, where you can throw in players into other lines on the fly and they can score and/or defend. Puck possession is key and that derives from your defense making a good outlet pass from the defensive zone and your center/winger moving it from neutral zone into the offensive zone and beginning the cycle when all 5 players enter the zone. 

Here is the issue. The bottom 6 cannot do this. Brodziak is not the center he was 3 years ago. He can play sound defense, but he cannot bury shots. His goal last night against BUF didn't even register a SOG because he was tripped up and it would have been a PS. He is meant to be a grinder and just play defense. So we are short that magical center who can equate to point production of Koivu and possibly Granlund if he can solidify his play. 

The 3rd and 4th line have seen an intermingle of players with Fontaine, Mitchell, Heatley, Rupp, Nino, Coyle, and Haula. That is over the span of 43 games. As I mentioned before, the premise of the system is to have 3 scoring lines...but none of these players outside of Haula have been consistent on the Bottom-6 pairings. Keyword: consistent. Because of that big of a parity, it is near impossible for players to get accustomed to what the other winger is going to do. What made pairings like Demitra/Gaborik or Bouchard/Rolston so successful is their ability to know where the other was going to be at. These lines were juggled simply to inject scoring into the Top 6 when Zucker would be recalled or Heatley went coughed and the puck went in. 

Then we have the bigger issue, the defense. Suter has a mystery injury as Russo has alluded to a few times. Brodin was out with a broken cheekbone for a few weeks and then wore a bubble that really hampered his play. Ballard takes a concussion and hasn't been the same since. The only 2 players remotely consistent outside the Ironman have been Spurgeon and Scandella. And while they are a decent D pairing, Spurgeon is built to be a MAB or Zidlick: PP Specialist. The defensive liability is still there because of his lack of size. Scandella coming into his own this year has made him a very good asset. But this is a Bottom 6 pairing, not a Top 4 pairing as they are playing right now. This team has always needed 2 more Top 4 Dmen who can sustain 20 minute play without hampering either offensive/defensive production.

Goaltending: Harding is certainly a major surprise this year. No one expected it. His MS treatment over the Hoildays appears to still be a setback, but should be able to sustain. After Backstrom took his concussion hit, he hasn't been the same. Whether the team is not playing well in front of him or the fact that he just scared to take another run-in, I don't know. But he is definitely letting in softies. 

**Who are the nucleus players?** The entire ""franchise record 6 game losing streak"" started when Zach went down with a broken foot as many of us knew it was. He continued to play and it really do much...so instead of letting it heal we lost a month of healing on the foot over this losing streak. The other was Harding leaving for the his treatment and Backstrom going in and losing to a very weak Pittsburgh team with none of their Top 5 D and only their top line did not see an AHL player in their midst. Not good for confidence going into another weak New York team either. Losing both Parise and Harding were the catalyst that Yeo couldn't find a player to plug with Koivu without breaking up Granlund/Pominville and Coyle has not deserved 1st line minutes. So the juggle began. Again...not good for chemistry when many of these guys haven't played with Mikko because of Zach. 

*What About Coaching?* The two biggest knocks I have on Yeo is that he does not know how to manage the lines to get the mismatches. You can't run his system when we are down an offensive minded center and his refusal to break up the love child of Zach-Mikko is concerning that he is allowing Mikko to pick his line...which is the same thing Richards did with him when Mittens (a 3rd line player) was on the top line and top minutes. Worked well for Koivu's points, but it did not work well for the team winning games. Why? You cannot run a system where these guys cannot sustain pressure in the offensive zone. Dump-n-Chase or even grinding on the boards just wears you out and a line change needs to happen. 

**What this team needs in the offseason...or even now** Top 2 Centermen, 2x Top4 Dmen, 1B starting quality goaltender. $21M to do it. 
tl;dr: it isn't all Yeo's fault, but he isn't helping matters any. "
Mr_Marram,WorldofTanks,1388760912.0,"I feel that it is actually one of the worst. 

* Terrible mobility, outclassed by every other T10 in the game apart from the Maus and JgdPz E-100.

* A very subpar gun, accuracy is bad (0.38 and 0.4). DPM is very bad, only a few tanks are worse than it, IS-4, IS-7, and the Maus (do you see a trend?). The pen is also very bad for a T10, in the low 200s and scraping into the 310-330 with gold rounds. There are tanks at T8 with better DPM, accuracy, and pen.

* The armour is very average, frontally it's ok for trolling pubbies, but anyone with half a brain knows the low front plate weak spot, or to just flank it as it is exceptionally slow. Now with the introduction of T10 TDs with 380-400+ pen (Obj 268 has 450 pen with gold), the frontal armour, even if slightly sloped or angled is useless."

* Tofu replaces paneer really well if you make it the right consistency. I don't know how my mom does it but I consider it a 100% accurate replacement.

I guess the question is, are you the settling down type? Do you know right now that you'd NEVER want to marry/have children? Or are you in a ""I'm not ready yet, but maybe in the future"" mindset? If this woman is looking to settle down with somebody, she has to know that pretty much no one is going to want to do that right away, and that it will take time to build a solid relationship. Relationships don't always work out, regardless of age, so it's always going to be a risk. If you really are falling for her and want to be with her, but you can't be certain you'll want a long-term commitment, that puts you in the same boat as pretty much any other man in the world that she might choose to date. It's up to her to decide whether she wants to take a chance on a relationship with you, knowing that it might not work out.

I think you explained your position really well in this post, so if you guys have a conversation about this stuff you should be able to explain your concerns to her and hear her out. Good luck.

deviantmoomba,atheism,1388761750.0,"Ok, you plainly have a basic denial of reality and no medical training whatsoever. Nymphomania affects both men and women, it is also called hypersexuality. Ever seen the movie 'Shame'? It discusses the issue for both genders. Sex can be just as addicting as drugs, because *they both cause changes in the chemical balances in the brain*. If you can become addicted to having benzoylmethylecgonine in your system, why not oxytocin and serotinin? 

Furthermore, sexsomniacs typically look and act as if they are awake, and hold no memory of the event. Therefore, how can the sex be consensual if they are not awake to give it? Sexsomnia is often brought on by stress; it is not a 'normal' aspect of sexual activity.

Though hypersexuality is a difficult thing to measure (an addiction or a personality problem?) there can be no doubt it affects people in serious ways. I invite you to read all of this: http://www.nhs.uk/news/2012/10October/Pages/Media-claims-sex-addiction-is-real.aspx

and at the bottom it states:

*""Patients assessed for hypersexual disorder also reported a “vast array” of negative consequences for hypersexual behaviour that were “significantly greater” than those diagnosed with either a general psychiatric condition or a substance-related disorder. These included job loss, loss of a romantic relationship, legal and financial problems""*

GetOffMyLawn_,fatlogic,1388762049.0,"OK, this is something I have meant to write up at some point. ATL has a degree in math but somehow managed to miss statistics along the way.

There is a wonderful book called ""The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail-but Some Don't"" by Nate Silver, an American statistician. The book focuses how people misunderstand probability. Personally I've always said people don't understand statistics because they don't understand the context. One chapter in the book is called ""How to Drown in Three Feet of Water"". He recites ""An oft-told joke: a statistician drowned crossing a river that was only three feet deep on average."" Maybe the river was only 6 inches deep in many places, but in other places it was 12 feet deep. Averages throw out much of the context and all the details. 

Saying that 14 or 16 pounds on average more doesn't constitute obesity is meaningless without knowing the starting point. If people were borderline obese before then 14 pounds would put them over the line. Furthermore, the causes of the weight gain are irrelevant in determining if someone is in fact obese or not. Their weight and body composition are the determining factors, not how they got there. 

The term epidemic can be defined mathematically or defined as a widespread extent. I am not going to go into the mathematical presentation since it's technical, you can find it on Wikipedia and other sites if you're interested. Given that over [a third of the population is now considered obese](http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@sop/@smd/documents/downloadable/ucm_319588.pdf) I would say that's pretty widespread."

The element of political stability is basically a racist element that makes western societies ""appear"" statistically superior, technically you can't prove a government is more or less stable on ""western variables"" like free speech or political participation, from what I read actually only economic prosperity is a predictor, and that is usually interpreted as a correlation with political stability rather than a precursor. But i digress, this to, is basically unrelated to R&amp;D efficiency and economic output.

Also if you allow me to put my tin foil hat, happy [fair use day ](http://everybodyslibraries.com/2014/01/01/public-domain-day-2014-the-fight-for-the-public-domain-is-on-now/).

crankypants15,FeMRADebates,1388762116.0,"&gt;&gt;     True, but that depends on your viewpoint. Some people want equal opportunity, some want equal results. Those are very different things.
&gt; 
&gt; Could you explain why the rules change here?

Sorry, I was thinking of racial quotas in hiring practices, not divorce. Regarding racial quotas in hiring practices: 

* Equal opportunity: everyone can apply for the job. The most qualified will get it. 
* Equal outcome: everyone can apply for the job, but minorities are chosen over more qualified applicants. This leads to really bad minority employees in some cases and the store gets a reputation of bad service, and the employee cannot be fired for fear of a lawsuit.

If you have some fancy art or a theme that appeals to me I'm down to buy it. For instance the Fox/Chicken version I wish I'd backed because it would appeal to my church group more than the Traditional Werewolf or the predecessor Mafia. 

I'm only offended by the prices of some of them.

[Werewolf with a video game parody theme](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1581373610/werewolf-power-up-edition?ref=live) - it looks pretty but $25+sh is a bit much for me.

[Are you the Werewolf - Deluxe](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/looneylabs/are-you-a-werewolf-deluxe-edition?ref=search) - from Looney Labs so you might expect something special and for that $40 it needed to be. You got these special neckchains. It's a fancy version of cards but it's was sorta nifty. $40 was a bit high imo but it's for a kickstarter

[8-bit](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1500444958/8-bit-mafia-and-8-bit-werewolf?ref=search) - $6 is a reasonable price for a deck of cards with fancy art. and if you're into the 8-bit aesthetic and personally I wasn't enough to make it an instabuy

doth_revenge,PurplePillDebate,1388762177.0,"You do realize that this says variation in female income only explains 22% / 39% (if using the pseudo r square which I didn't see an explanation of how they got) of variation in divorce?

All a lot of those tables prove is that there is a causal relationship between education and projected female income- the only levels of which are significant (t-score beyond 3) are university education.

I'd be interested in seeing an updated version of this with more recent data and also see a consideration of what multicollinearity could exist with the female income variable- some things that I think logically exist alongside having a higher income would be a woman's ability to live on her own (thus lessening barriers to divorce), her opportunities to meet other successful men (and see how this correlates with her likelihood to cheat- with more opportunities available does this increase, and does that have a causal relationship with divorce?), and I would also like to see similar evaluations done with a man's income- oh, and consideration of which party asked for the divorce.  Also, if the traditional roles are switched- i.e. the woman is the primary income and the man is the secondary- does the correlation with divorce still exist as strongly?

It's not that I don't think some correlation exists- I'm sure there is. I just think saying divorce is more likely strictly because of higher female income is a little short sighted. And that might not have been exactly what you were saying, but that was the vibe I got."

crankypants15,FeMRADebates,1388762529.0,"&gt; I'd appreciate sources on some of your points; I'm curious about ""forced out by the wife"". 

The wife can be verbally or physically abusive, or start destroying the man's property. Thus creating a hostile environment encouraging the man to leave. If the police are called, in many cases, the police will ask the man to move out anyway. 
Source: cases of friends and families since the 1970s and my own case. Also the wife can claim domestic violence and Michigan law states the man is automatically arrested and jailed, regardless of evidence at the time, while an investigation is done. 

&gt; Also, are you saying that the custody cases are delayed past the divorce proceedings, resulting in alimony? I want to make sure I'm following you.

No. Here are the steps I was trying to convey.

1. Someone, say the husband, files for divorce or leaves the house. In Michigan, he is responsible for child support and alimony from that date onward even though the divorce is not final.
2. Custody battles proceed, man has to find money for alimony, child support, CS battle, and a new apartment/home. 
3. Divorce becomes final later one. Custody battle may or may not be done. These can take over a year in some cases. 

&gt; Were you divorced when you left? 

I left due to the abuse, then filed for divorce the week I left, after I got my belongings out. 


&gt; I'm confused about the child support.

She had a much higher income than I did, which pushed BASE CS rates very high. The base CS rate was 75% of my take home pay, and we split the base rate. I ended up being responsible for paying 25% of my net income after taxes. Since I couldn't afford that out of my paycheck, I paid CS in one lump sum, which about equaled
 my share of the house equity. Thus, I gained no significant assets from the divorce proceedings. Financially, it was like I was just out of college starting over. Though I did end up keeping my retirement fund, but I can't use that (nor do I want to) to buy a house. 

If you have another question, please be specific, I will try to answer as best I can. 

&gt;  Do you have a suggestion for recourse? I've been advocating free legal aid for these types of situations,

Oh hell no. The public defender system in Michigan is one of the worst in the US, ranked 44th ([search Google for articles](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=michigan+public+defender+system)). So, relying on the state of Michigan is a big NOPE.

namer98,Christianity,1388762685.0,"From Rashi:

&gt;Let us make man: From here we learn the humility of the Holy One, blessed be He. Since man was created in the likeness of the angels, and they would envy him, He consulted them. And when He judges kings, He consults with His Heavenly household, for so we find regarding Ahab, that Micah said to him, (I Kings 22:19): “I saw the Lord seated on His throne, and all the host of heaven were standing by Him, on His right and on His left.” Now do “left” or “right” apply to Him ?! But rather, [the passage means that] these [angels] were standing on the right to defend, and these [angels] were standing on the left to prosecute. Likewise, (Dan. 4:14): “By the decree of the destructive angels is the matter, and by the word of the holy ones is the edict.” Here too, He took counsel with His heavenly household. He said to them, “Among the heavenly beings, there are some in My likeness. If there are none in My likeness among the earthly beings, there will be envy among the creatures of the Creation. ” - [from Tanchuma, Shemoth 18; Gen. Rabbah 8:11, 14:13]

&gt;Let us make man: Even though they [the angels] did not assist Him in His creation, and there is an opportunity for the heretics to rebel (to misconstrue the plural as a basis for their heresies), Scripture did not hesitate to teach proper conduct and the trait of humility, that a great person should consult with and receive permission from a smaller one. Had it been written: “I shall make man,” we would not have learned that He was speaking with His tribunal, but to Himself. And the refutation to the heretics is written alongside it [i. e., in the following verse:]“And God created (וַיִּבְרָא) ,” and it does not say,“and they created וַיִּבְרְאוּ.” - [from Gen. Rabbah 8:9]"

voodoo_curse,Harley,1388762835.0,"The most I have ever gotten out of a full tank was 129 miles. That, however, was under ideal riding conditions. I didn't really feel comfortable pushing it that far but had no choice. I have never run the tank completely out, I usually feel safe refuelling at about 110 miles. While refueling so often can be a pain, it's very cheap to do it. I've been able to get over half a tank with just some spare change in my pocket.

Top gear on the 883 starts to sputter and lag around 55mph, so anytime you're going below 60 you definitely want to be in a lower gear. That has an obvious effect on gas mileage. I usually stick to around 70 on the highway. Any faster and it starts to get uncomfortable anyway due to the lack of windscreen. On twisty mountain roads, I usually stay a little bit below the speed limit, but I know the bike could handle more if I pushed it."

Why do I think this? Because I am the same way.

Well, I used to be. I was abused psychologically and physically by my parents growing up. I lost my voice. I didn't know that what I wanted and needed was just as important as what others wanted and needed. I just could not for the life of me communicate how I was REALLY feeling.

Therapy has helped. And if he your fiance is not suffering from a psychotic break, this seems to be the case to me. Only because his behavior is so much like mine used to be. Not being able to stick to a thought process, changing reasons, changing my mind, etc. I didn't have the explosive anger you described, but the rest? Yeah. I acted like everything was just fine, and then BOOM. Ended. I was selfish.

First you have to address whether that idea (misogyny here) is 'bad'.  A few culture's believe it's ok to eat other humans.  I would venture a guess to say that almost everyone else thinks that's not ok.  Who is wrong there?  You and I would say they are wrong; they would say we are wrong for judging them.  The right answer under this philosophy is your own answer.

Next you have to look at how you are discriminating against something.  You have to first realize that discrimination is not inherently wrong; it only is wrong when it is used as a tool to disregard someone on the basis of a group characteristic that they may or *may not* have without actually looking at the individual.  The word really just means to choose but it has taken on an undeserved negative reputation.

Now look at misogyny and who practices it.  It's not just a wide swathe of Arabs.  There are people in every country that practice it that can be casually linked by other characteristics, perhaps religion, culture, nationality, ethnicity, etc.

When it comes down to it, are do you hate the actions or the group?  If you don't like all Iraqis for the fact that they are Iraqi, then you discriminating on the basis of nationality.  Is that inherently bad? I would say yes because you aren't considering individuals and their differing characteristics.  If you are discriminating against all people who are misogynistic (which you and I have agreed upon is an alright thing) *because* they are misogynistic but they all happen to be Arab (in this hypothetical) then you aren't being racist.  You are being  misogynistic-ist? 

Now to get into the touchy subjects.  If a religion has its followers kill people (not just the radicals but everyone in the religion) and you discriminate against it are you wrong?  I say no.  But again that's an opinion (as this all is.)  If *everyone* in a race eats people and you discriminate against them on that basis are you wrong? No.  But that doesn't happen in real life (not to mention the entire classification of race is a bunch of hogwash.)  

tl;dr: It's the reason behind your discrimination that matters, not who its against (as long as you don't project to a group undeservedly.)  It's a fine line between who and what you are discriminating against."

Let's start with the name. It's a difficult word, the Holocaust! Let's call it the Holy Coast from now on, okay? Yay!

There was a man in a country far away, let's call him Uncle Dolf, who thought that some people were not fun to play with. Now, what do we do when we meet someone who isn't fun? We just walk away, correct! Yay! But, Uncle Dolf didn't want to! He called those people, Jews were they called, bad and not good friends. That's not a nice thing to say! 

Uncle Dolf decided that these Jews had to wear fancy schmancy yellow stars on their clothes. Do you know why? So people could recognize them! He then asked his friends if they could tell the Jews nobody liked them and all that! We would get in serious trouble with the teachers for that! 

Then, after making sure these Jews didn't feel very welcome anymore, Uncle Dolf started building a sort of playing camps. He thought the Jews would be better off there, where they could play together and not bother the other people. But these camps were not very nice! They had very difficult names, like Dachau and Auschwitz. There were also very little toys to play with and the Jews were forced to sit in boring classrooms all day and do boring stuff. Uncle Dolf had a very, very difficult word for this: the Endlösung. That's in another language! He wasn't a very nice man, but boy, was he smart! 

More and more Jews were sent to these camps, but other people wanted to play with them again. They also didn't like Uncle Dolf anymore! That's where the USA comes in! Yay! The boss of the USA, Mister Roosie, wanted to tell Uncle Dolf nobody wanted to play with him anymore. Then suddenly, Mister Roosie started finding all these camps with Jews in them. The Jews were happy to play with other people again, but they were sad too. Do you know why? Well, remember that time when grandma took a really, really long vacation? It's sort of like that. A lot of Jews took really long vacations. Then, Mister Roosie found out that Uncle Dolf had put a lot of other people in those camps! It turned out Uncle Dolf didn't like a whole lot of people! 

Then, a while later, Uncle Dolf himself took a long holiday! And so did Mister Roosie! Mister Roosie's best friend, Harry TrumTrum, took over and the friends of Uncle Dolf all said sorry. There were other people involved too, you know! Who has heard of Russia? You see, Russia was angry at Uncle Dolf too, because Uncle Dolf didn't like Russia! 

Now, a lot of people are still angry about the Holy Coast. A lot of people promised each other to always be nice to each other and try to play together, so the Holy Coast wouldn't happen again! Yay!

Next week, we'll tell you all about how Harry TrumTrum and Mister Stall In, the boss of Russia, nearly got in a fight!

mmp31,politics,1388763370.0,"There's a reason that engineers make X amount of times the amount of money that minimum wage workers make. It's because that's what the market has determined their labor is worth relative to each other, using our pricing structure to describe the labor values in absolute terms. The same goes for any job relative to another.

No amount of raising the minimum wage is EVER going to change the real relative labor values. What it does do, however, is distort the pricing structure until it (somewhat) recovers from government abuse. Eventually the wages of higher earners will go up and minimum wage earners will be making the same amount of money compared to the higher income groups as they were before.

Anybody who supports raising minimum wage is just jerking off because they don't want to address the real problem, which is inflation. Since the minimum wage increase in 2009, prices have gone up 9%, which means that the poor have seen a decrease in their income of 9%. For people who can barely feed themselves, that is SIGNIFICANT.

Locking minimum wage to inflation is a non-solution, because it will not change the fact that the poor's wages will be devalued until minimum wage goes up again. If one really cares about the poor, they would demand that the government immediately abolish inflation, which is controlled entirely by the Federal Reserve. Then we won't have to worry about rising prices harming the poor.

The problem was that she was flirting by just being friendly and playing with my hair. I had really long hair at the time so lots of girls played with it because they thought I just had awesome hair.

Kahneman and Tversky is a great paper on non-rational decision making. You may want to try to get your hands on a copy of kahneman's book. Much of it deals with your topic and gives behaviors you may want to look for.

2) Fair enough

3)
&gt;To kill Man is to reach Heaven, from where we came before the Doom Drum's iniquity. When we accomplish this, we can escape the mockery and long shame of the Material Prison. To achieve this goal, we must:  

&gt;- Erase the Upstart Talos from the mythic. His presence fortifies the Wheel of the Convention, and binds our souls to this plane.

&gt;- Remove Man not just from the world, but from the Pattern of Possibility, so that the very idea of them can be forgotten and thereby never again repeated.

&gt;- With Talos and the Sons of Talos removed, the Dragon will become ours to unbind. The world of mortals will be over. The Dragon will uncoil his hold on the stagnancy of linear time and move as Free Serpent again, moving through the Aether without measure or burden, spilling time along the innumerable roads we once travelled. And with that we will regain the mantle of the imperishable spirit.

Sounds to me like they're trying to destroy the world. ""Escape the mockery...of the Material Prison""? ""Regain the mantle of the imperishable spirit""? I don't really see a different interpretation. If you have one, let me know, please.

4) I thought you were saying those types of dungeons were going to be original ideas, when they clearly aren't.

5) Okay, I didn't know about fantasy tiers.

6) And then they would just let any Joe Schmoe wander in and join them?

7) Again, I thought you were saying that idea would have been original and never-before-seen.

8) No need to get testy, I misunderstood. Talking about water and islands makes me think of boats, and getting from one island to another would require a boat.

ninjapizza,sydney,1388763962.0,"I read a bit down the page, so I apologise if I am recapping statements already made.

* Public Transport  
It is ridiculous in a 24-Hour city like Sydney to have Public Transport that shuts down at 2-5am on a Friday Night Saturday Morning. During this time, Taxi's also decide that they want to do a shift change and this results in drunk people who may want to get home, who are unable to.  

Trains should run 24x7 during the weekends to allow people who where not drunk enough to go home at 2am, but way to drunk at 3am to be allowed in any RSA venues and unable to go home, rather then roaming the streets for 4 hours looking for something to do.

* Trains should be free on a weekend / at night to discourage drink driving in the city (I know we have punitive measures for that already, but this way it encourage people to be utilize this transport even more, and potentially stop the vulturistic attitude of Cab Drivers at 2:00am - 3:30am.

* Venues need to take responsibility for the people they kick out, rather then just making the problem no longer theirs, they need to accountable for actions after someone leaves the club / pub.    

Now personally I hate the RSA laws, I think they are key example of the Nanny state that we live in, and that people should be responsible for their own behaviours. But we do have the (RSA Laws) and for the most part the only time someone is refused service is when it's to late and a drunk person is causing problems for other patrons in a bar.    

With that aside out of the way, I think if someone is kicked out of a pub, it is because they have already had to much to drink (and it clearly happened at this establishment because the bouncer let them in in the first place)    

Why not hold an establishment partially liable for the actions of someone once they leave the premises until they enter another venue. (We have enough cameras in the city to monitor this)
So for example, instead of kicking a drunk person on the street, the establishment can do that, and if the person causes more trouble, they are partially liable, or the establishment can chose to put the person in a cab and send them on their way (to the address that is on their license - the one that was scanned at the door)

I accept this isn't the best solution, hell, it's not even a good ones, but it's a start.

Finally as /r/Pandantica has pointed out - Give people something other then drinking to do in the city.

The one I posted here was a rejected version and I was using it to find what looks good. My final version is not done yet, but I really love it and I think it keeps the Eva feel!

If anyone gives a shit, here's the Eva rules/tips on drawing their heads:

* Make it a bit modular. Almost nothing is flat.

* Have a balance between organic and inorganic because it is a Bio-mech.

* Nothing too complex at all. Keep it relatively simple.

* Study Evangelion's concept art to see how he got to the finished designs. It may help, depending on how you are.

* Every head has a different feel than the other, so if your head doesnt give the same feel as Unit 01, or 02, and so forth, that is completely fine as long as it has an **EVANGELION** feel.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388764042.0,"I don't have a strict criteria, but I know too much when I see it.

I think a big issue, especially in the US, is that this level of inequality was not always a problem, and that it's steadily rising. I think another issue is that our income and wealth structures resemble banana republics more than other countries of similar stature. 

Combine this with ideas like ""trickle down theory"" and the concept of ""a tide that raises all boats"", and I think we have a solid case for social change.

So in short, I think a lot of it is based on:

1) What other countries are doing

2) How things were compared to the past

3) What we're promised vs what we're getting

I mean, I think most people will accept we'll always have SOME level of income inequality, it's just that when taken to an extreme it becomes problematic. Especially when 1) other countries similar to the US aren't experiencing this problem, due to different policies, and 2) things used to be a lot more equal and prosperous, but now they're not, especially when combined with 3) promises that everyone will benefit from blatantly pro rich policies.

Other factors could include power relationships between the rich and the poor (are the rich responsible for the poor's misery? or do we truly live in a vacuum in which one person's success doesn't lead to another's failure?) and how comfortable the poor actually are.

So, to go back to why income inequality in America is a problem, let's look at the following:

1) Other first world countries have much more generous social safety nets, less inequality, and the poor are better off in some ways. Moreover, these countries don't seem to sacrifice a whole lot to get it, they're often as free as our society, for instance, although they might see stricter economic regulations at times.

2) Since WWII, inequality has been relatively low, while there have always been poor, social safety nets have helped them, and for many, jobs were much more plentiful and paid more comparatively speaking. However, over time, the middle class has been squeezed and now an entire new generation is likely going to get the finger while the rich make out like bandits.

3) We were told that these policies would improve our standard of living. That the wealth would trickle down, that unleashing the economy would be a tide that lifts all boats. So much for that philosophy.

4) Since the poor rely on the rich to create jobs and pay taxes to fund safety nets for their sustenance, cuts in social services, cuts in taxes, low wages, and adverse working conditions, especially when the rich are prospering more than ever, are flat out immoral IMO. The rich are bleeding the poor dry while they're profiting more than ever.

5) How comfortable the poor is, is a matter of debate. Some would argue our poor are comparatively rich, but on the other hand, they also are working MUCH harder for less money than in the past, which harms quality of life, and if you cut off unemployment benefits and the like, like what's happening, that's just gonna make them less comfortable. Not to mention there are the psychological effects of being financially insecure, etc.

That being said, context matters more than an exact number of inequality. I think the bigger questions have to do with why we are unequal, and examine the issue within an international and historical context. We need to look at the big picture. I think in a vacuum inequality is not as much of a problem. I think that we need to examine larger trends to understand the problem, and why it's a problem in the first place."

Things go well in Colorado it opens the doors for other states to legalize, things go badly and those doors get slammed and locked.  I'm not sure why you think that the marijuana industry is limited to Colorado, there are still 48 other states that think of it as illegitimate.

Testing for potency would *reduce* liability, and increase customer retention.  How can you possibly think that making the effort to provide a *consistent* product is wasteful?  If you went to a doughnut shop and one day the doughnuts were delicious but the next day they tasted like shit would you continue to buy from them or find a place that sold good doughnuts every day?

It's called logic.  Ignoring all other considerations, a dispensary that does inspect the product they sell and make some guarantee of quality will attract and retain much more business than a dispensary that makes no guarantees and sells you marijuana that's full of mold and mite shit.  Quality control is good for business and the continuing struggle to get nation-wide legalization.

However, telling people that they can't perform a centuries-old tradition because ""Well, we don't want to have to clean up your mess"" NEVER works out well. Someone thought up this idea of ""Rice is harmful to birds"", it spread, and soon it became Legend.

Similar to the religious proscription against eating pork. People were eating ill-prepared pork and getting sick or dying. The people in charge (usually the religious leaders) couldn't just say, ""Hey, don't eat that tasty pig, even though that's the only food you have. You might get sick and die.""

And as you're kind enough to point out, my team's not sniffing the playoffs for a decade. I'm just calling it as I see it.

Your survivability depends quite heavily on the group you are running with. You've gotta have a decent amount of support through other players nearby you and Water Fields from Staff Elementalists to truly bring out the potential. Remember that Hammer #2 is amazing and a Blast finisher.

* wizard anything: meteors seek out enemies azmodan style.

* wizard anything: meteors spawn mirror images where they land: these mirror images can cast blackhole on their current location.

* wizard helm: old archon length increase passive(I can only dream)

* wizard source: attackspeed increases arcane power regeneration(2.0 attack speed is double regen 3.0 is tipple)(source would have poor stats)

* wizard wand: reduces cooldowns based on attackspeed same as source

* wizard chest: sets your health to 1 but gives you an energy barrier doing electric damage recharges it. but there is no maximum, when above what your health would be the shield deteriorate when not doing electric damage at a more rapid pace depending on how much more health you have health also regenerates when below maximum rapidly after not taking damage for a few seconds.

* wizard boots: cooldown of teleport is reset after x number of kills or standing still for 2 seconds.

* wizard anything: energy spenders no longer do damage and have no cooldown(teleport, frost nova, ect. unchanged) the damage they would do grant you arcane power. your signature spells now cost arcane power and do xxx% more damage.

* wizard boots: allows you to move while channeling if targeted the attack goes towards to cursor.speed is reduces while channeling(gives sweet floating animation)

* wizard gloves: mirror images now explode on contact with an enemy for (reasonable) damage and cast a frost nova.

* wizard pants: things that die to your arcane damage leave behind arcane rifts which give a huge movespeed boost for a few seconds when walked on(for everyone yay group play).

* wizard pants: same thing as above but with frost only faster and only when standing on the ice. the ice covers a larger area.

* wizard neck: teleporting leaves a trail of arcane mines behind(this plus a few other items would make really fun teleport builds possible).

I'm also lurking wishlists

Do you need **junk** for the rubbish avatar? Let me make it rain (stinking hot garbage) on you!

You want some **scratchcards**, baby? I'm your gurl, gurl.

I mass collect the following: **Woo Woo Grub**, **Roast Tentacle** and **Spooky Shake**.

I'm looking for **petpet plushies** and **plushie petpets** I don't have in my [gallery](http://www.neopets.com/gallery/index.phtml?view=all&amp;gu=fonzischeme)

Also, here's my [wishlist](http://items.jellyneo.net/mywishes/philmfcollins). Ignore the ""interesting petpets"" section. I'm mulling over future petpets for my petbabbies. 


I'm taking a more casual approach to training now that I'm at over 700 for Str/Def/HP, so give your red codestones to someone more in need than me. Thank you SO MUCH to the people who have gifted me so many great things, from NC to codestones to BUYING OUT MY WHOLE DAMN SHOP THAT TIME JESUS.

Basically, there is NO society in the world that treats women so poorly that men of this ilk will NOT consider it great, because the worse women are treated and the lower they are viewed to be, the more submissive and easily controlled and sexually use- and abuseable they will be perceived (or actually be forced to be), and that is exactly what these men want."

Would you be that worried about it affecting his decision making in the future? No, not particularly, but it just seems stupid to have put yourself in a situation where it gets called into question in the first place.

&gt;When I copied and pasted the Daniel 4:14 passage into Google, 

The idea is close enough, I think the translation might be a bit off, or he is adding his own idea to the text. I get a translation of ""The matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the sentence by the word of the holy ones""

&gt;But this isn't a consultation, it's simply a statement of what God is going to do.

He doesn't go into the back and forth of the consultation. He is referring to midrash literature where the back and forth is talked about.

&gt;Given other statements in the passage, this strikes me as an attempt to explain away a passage that Christians were referencing as evidence for the trinity, rather than being an independent theological conclusion.

He is indeed giving a counter, but he refers to midrashic texts which often predate Christianity."

banana-tree,Turkey,1388765790.0,"No one seems to be talking about the corruption, or the scandal, as things have become mostly about a power struggle now. And Erdoğan is only one side of that power struggle. This isn't (or shouldn't be) just about whether people like Erdoğan and his policies. Anyway..

I think Erdoğan is too authoritarian. That has its advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is political stability, and sustained policies that come with it. We've seen the benefits of that significantly in economy and the Kurdish issue. However, in the past 10 years, their growing confidence and arrogance has pretty much removed all accountability. They have the power to pass any law they like and reject all suggestions of the opposition, and they use it. The recent crisis has seen them throw rule of law and separation of powers out the window entirely. Those are my primary concerns right now*. 

The particular case with Gulen Movement's control over the judiciary is hard to understand without studying recent Turkish political history, but I'll try. Briefly, AKP has facilitated their staffing in the judiciary and the police as it was for their benefit for the past decade, and now that the movement's agenda seems to be shifting away from them, they have realized this may not have been the best idea. They've helped boost the movement's power in the government that is now being used against them, and to fight it they're relentlessly bringing down the entire judiciary and the police who dared bring up corruption charges against their kids and business pals right before elections (and yes, the timing was intentional on the movement's part, there's no denying that).

So it's a bit complicated. An organization in the government that acts with a certain agenda that originates from outside the government, whatever that agenda is, is a dangerous thing not just for AKP but for everyone. So I think that should've been prevented, and should be eliminated. I don't think ignoring all law and all principles of democracy is the best way to do that, as I worry that that will result in those methods becoming permanent and would give the ruling parties unchecked, unlimited power. I would also like the corruption charges to be followed through fairly and transparently (from experience, I don't think the Gulen folks in the judiciary would do a good job with either the 'fair' or 'transparent' bits). I don't know how any of this can actually be done as things stand now.

*: I'll put this at the end as an appendix since you asked about specific policies and it doesn't really pertain to the current crisis. A more specific problem for me is eroding personal liberties, both online and offline (including but not limited to restricted websites, prosecution of speech, including blasphemy, very limited and arbitrary permission for demonstrations etc.). The restrictions aren't entirely new or without secular reasoning (at least on the surface), but they are extensive, and even more dangerously the party and its supporters keep sticking to a line that they're justified simply because the majority wants them (majority in the parliament, really, they actually have slightly less than %50 votes). To be fair, since we're talking about personal freedoms, I'll add that they've removed some of the restrictions on the where headscarves can be worn, and I appreciate that."

azayii,books,1388765812.0,"For one, Guy Gavriel Kay - haven't read him yet but all of his books include settings other than English Medieval - for instance, *Under Heaven*, which I'll be reading shortly, is based in Tang dynasty China.

*Throne of the Crescent Moon* by Saladin Ahmed is set in the Middle East, which is refreshing, and includes demons, gods etc. without being religious. While there are references to holy god often, it isn't in a preachy way - just in a ""this is the culture of the characters"" kind of thing.

If you haven't read *Promise of Blood* yet, it is excellent. A traditional fantasy in most senses, however, the inclusion of gunpowder magic really makes it more interesting (as well as a lack of elf/dwarf/standard fantasy species).

For urban fantasy, I really loved *The Blue Blazes*, which came out last year, by Chuck Wendig. Good stuff.

*The Drowning City* is a lesser known high fantasy with a main character that takes action, that is set in culture more unusual than most. Kind of a combination of SE Asian and Arab cultures (if I remember correctly...it's been a while).

Another book I haven't read is *On Stranger Tides*, but then, all Tim Powers books are set in non-traditional fantasy settings. You should check him out. Oh! And *Three Parts Dead* by Max Gladstone is an unusual, urban world.

Hopefully one of these will appeal to you!"

No it isn't - its akin to punishing the guys who pay the robber to rob. We (myself included) create the demand for dealers, and we offer financial reward for the risk they take. If customers were too scared to pick up then the market would dry up. Dealers and prospective dealers respond to these incentives. No one wants to enter a business where your target market is shrinking and are more anxious. 


You're arguing the wrong point entirely. You're arguing against the war on drugs (fair enough - I might agree with you), I'm arguing for a war on drugs which would actually achieve what it sets out to accomplish, rather than making dealing more attractive (which is what it's doing now)."

Czar-Salesman,SubredditDrama,1388766104.0,"If there are actual differences in transgendered people's brains what makes it not a disorder? We classify most everything else with such brain differences as disorders, is it just because we are so PC? I don't think there is anything wrong with being trans* but what makes it exempt from being a disorder? I'm really curious because I've thought about it some but not much and just can't wrap my head around it so I usually abstain from developing an opinion on it and just leave it be.

Looking at it biologically(if everything develops correctly) my brain should function as male genitalia and gonads makes me a man who wants to procreate with females. Anything else would logically be labeled a disorder would it not? This doesn't mean there is anything morally wrong with the person or that they should seek help they were just born that way. Where is this line of reasoning wrong?

Again, I really would like someone to explain it so I can understand.

One of my good friends got one done and her boyfriend didn't even take off work to go with her, even though he'd take off if he had a bad hangover any other day. Asshole. So I went with her.

You don't donate $50 to a church/charitable organization/The Human Fund and pay $50 less in taxes. You donate the $50 and *maybe* pay a couple bucks less on your taxes.

Splitting up donations for churches and other non profits would be a mess. I mean, why shouldn't someone who donates to a church, many of which do good works in there local community (food shelf, soup kitchens, what have you, churches back a ton of local social programs) not enjoy the same write off that some who donates $50 to help Susan G.Komen come out with a line of pink socket wrenches?

And where do you draw the line? Does donating to your local parish not count for a write off, but Catholic Relief Services does? Knights of Columbus? Salvation Army?

It's definitely better to leave it alone.

* Mac N Cheese (the homemade kind with bread crumbs roasted on top)

* I take B12 (3,000mcg) because I'm deficient

* Eggs. So versatile, so yummy!

* As a general thing, I try and sneak veggies in everything (because my husband won't eat them and because it lowers calorie dense foods.

For example: Mac N Cheese is a fave here. So I take a whole head of cauliflower, chop it up and boil it. Then I stick it in a blender. I then cook an entire box of pasta. 

Next mix blended cauliflower with pasta in a long lasagna pan (pyrex). Mix in any cheese(s) of your choice, salt, pepper, garlic or garlic powder. 

Top with a sprinkle of bread crumbs, bake in the oven at about 450 deg until the bread crumbs turn golden brown.  Lowers the calories per serving by about 150 :D"

They don't fund shit, the rich don't get subsidized money from the government.  They use venture capitalists like Bain Capital and investors to build their businesses.  These are the successful ones, the idiots use government money and fail like Solyndra.  

Also, I have to say that companies like GE and big oil getting tax breaks is bullshit but that isn't a rich person that is a corporation.  Tax them first at a normal or slightly higher rate, then tax the poor for not contributing shit to society but just being a sucker of the teet instead.  

Everyone should contribute from the wealthy to the poor and the corporations need to pay too.  

The fact that the poor don't have to file taxes is bullshit, and so is the welfare system for people that stay on the rolls their entire lives.  I understand a safety net, but it is just a 'career path' for some of the sad sorry losers in this country."

This area of the country has been in recession since the 70's. She had an amazing, very well paid job, and has tons of experience and training in her field. But she got thrown out of the job because -- she was white, yup. **They weren't even subtle about it.** But you can't touch a Native American corporation. Or, rather, no one wants to. She has approached lawyers, hell she even went to the police after people posted death threats against her for being white and 'taking a natives job'. But no one wants to go after the Natives, it's too touchy, and the laws are too grey. So she got screwed over. Yet, save for anyone who hears her story, she's completely OK with it... In her words 'It's no different than a corporate takeover. I just didn't have the protection I would normally have had.' But the injustice for the reasons behind it is what blows my mind. Fire the white chick, put in a Native for a job they're unqualified for... buy that Native's vote for the next election (Bribery is A-OK, and totally open on the Rez!).

And then you sit here, and say 'my GOD! What a freeloader...' It's been less than six months for her. And we're all terrified because we know the game. We know how this works. The longer you go, the less chance you have at being hired. The game is rigged. People don't magically find jobs when the benefits run out. 

No, they get a crappy minimum wage job far below what they were making. They get fleeced, robbed and shanghaied into wage-Slave territory. This is a rigged game, and your attitude helps perpetuate it. And I sincerely hope you never go through long-term unemployment.

Hey /r/MTB  !!

 I am in the market for a new bike and have decided on a 27.5 and could really use your expertise.  I have been out of MTB for the last 3 years, ever since I relocated from Phoenix to Cincinnati. Life got in the way but now I'm looking to get back in the game.

About Me:

* 5'6'', 220 lbs  (Weight lifter, though I could stand to lose 20 lbs)     ***sigh***
* Did a lot of desert riding out in Arizona for about 3 years
* Old bike was a Trek 4500 (2004).  This thing is heavy, but it got the job done.  I still have it, but I'm looking to upgrade.
* I was in the market for a new bike 3 years ago, but then I got this job transfer and MTB just disappeared from my life (entirely my own doing, I know)
* Big fan of singletrack and trail riding, was never into DH

Things to Note:

* Since I dropped the sport, I see that 27.5 has taken off and I see that it offers what I'm looking for (especially since 29ers can be too big for short guys like me)
* Budget is in the $1,000-$1,500 range
* Prefer complete bikes, as I'm not too confidant that I can build one on my own.  Plus, free maintenance from a local shop is always nice.

Potential Bikes I've Seen:

* Giant Talon 1 (MSRP $1,380)
* Kona Cinder Cone (MSRP $1,199)
* Others?  Suggestions?  

Are there any others in this price range?  I would love to have a list of bikes for me to go in and do greater research, as I don't like going to a bike shop since they'll usually only limit the discussion to the brands they sell.  I'd like to have my short-list of bikes, then go to the shops that carry those brands.

This has never been an issue for any of the rest of us primarily because *he never brings it up or tried to convince the rest of us to convert.* YOU might be a perfectly tolerant person but fact of the matter is that a LOT of vegans ARE the preachy, intolerant, obnoxious type that no one wants to be around. 

I've seen vegans throw huge angry fits at someone who was *medically incapable of surviving* on a vegan diet, because they refused to accept that there was any valid reason whatsoever to not be a vegan. I've seen vegans accuse non-vegetarians of being vicious animal-tormenters/killers and calling them worse names than most people might lob at someone who had literally tormented an animal to death. I've seen political vegans who feel the need to bring veganism into literally every conversation that had anything to do with food OR politics, and would get very angry if anyone did not immediately capitulate to their side. 

So yeah, you aren't a jerk, and there are other vegans out there who aren't jerks either, but there are enough of you who ARE jerks, and a very special, highly aggressive type of jerk at that, that a lot of people have developed a knee-jerk reaction to the phrase ""I'm a vegan"" because of their past terrible experiences."

creamcheesefiasco,curlyhair,1388766745.0,"**Curl Type:** Mostly 3C, with sections of 3B underneath/around my ears and nape and sections of 4A around my crown/back of my head. My hair is very soft, cottony, and springy/bouncey.

**Porosity:** Normal/medium. My hair takes about 1.5-2 hours to completely air dry if not in a ponytail/puff/bun.

**Other hair info:** Very dense hair, but my individual strands are very fine. Most people label my hair as ""thick,"" but it isn't thick in the truest sense of the definition. It's just very dense and I have a lot of hair. My hair is almost shoulder length when unstretched and almost bra strap length when stretched. I have no colour in my hair and I've been relaxer-free since 2003 and stopped heat straightening in 2005. I haven't put heat on my hair since then.

My summer and winter routines are different, but since it's winter where I live, I will explain my current winter routine. I'm currently doing the *L.O.C Method*, which stands for Liquid/Leave-In, Oil, and Cream. 

I DO NOT follow the Curly Girl Method.

**Daily Routine:** 

Every morning I get my hair wet in the shower and apply conditioner (Tresemme Naturals or L'Oreal Power Moisture). Leave conditioner on hair while I finish my shower (5-15 minutes). Rinse out and gently finger detangle any major tangles. I do not detangle daily because it breaks up my natural curl pattern and makes my hair frizzy. I squeeze out as much water from my hair as possible.

I let my hair dry with a microfibre towel/turban for 5-10 minutes while I get dressed/ready for my day. I then apply my leave-in (Africa's Best Organics Olive Oil Moisturizing Growth Lotion). I then oil my hair with either pure argan oil or olive oil. I do not use coconut oil in the winter. For my cream, I use Taliah Waajid Curly Curl Cream, although I'm currently in search of a better cream. If I'm wearing my hair out/down, I will apply a bit of gel (currently using IC Fantasia Styling Gel but I'm not married to it). 

I don't do anything special at night other than put my hair up using a satiny soft scrunchie.

**Once A Week:**

I shampoo my hair using Dove's Daily Moisture shampoo. I then deep condition my hair for 15-45 minutes. I don't have a favourite deep conditioner right now, I'm currently experimenting with different brands (currently testing out Africa's Best Organic Cholesterol Tea Tree Conditioner). After my hair has been deep conditioned, I finger detangle any major knots first and then detangle my entire head of hair using a wide tooth comb. I may have to apply more conditioner to certain areas if the tangle is particularly knotty. I rinse out the deep conditioner and then follow up with my L.O.C routine, except I use more oil than usual or add shea butter.

And to answer some of OP's questions....

*Is squish-to-condish your best friend ever? Or are you kind of really addicted to plopping?* Neither method makes any noticeable difference to my hair other than adding more time to my routine. 

*If you enjoy second day curls, what's your second day routine/products/magic?* I don't do second day hair because it takes LONGER to get my second day curls to look nice than it does to simply re-wet and restyle my hair.

deananana,knitting,1388766759.0,"You're going to have to frog it. Two inches is a big size difference, and it's pretty close to impossible to successfully block something into a smaller size.  As for making the front panel smaller, you would end up with a really weirdly cockeyed sweater. (There is a reason you've NEVER purchased a sweater with a bigger back than front.)

Knitting an entire sweater that doesn't fit will feel way worse than knitting 1/3 of a sweater that doesn't work.

You've got a couple possible approaches going forward (but they all require frogging). 
1) Before you frog, measure the gauge you're getting, and find a pattern that matches that gauge. (You can search by gauge on ravelry!)  (You may want to look  specifically for [patterns that use that yarn](http://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/noro-kureyon/patterns?category=pullover); it might increasing your chances of success.)Start knitting a different sweater.
2) Experiment with swatching with different needle sizes until you find a way to match the gauge needed to make that sweater, and then re-start knitting that sweater.

Congratulate yourself on catching this problem before it's too late! My first sweater was tunic length, and i knit the entire front and back before realizing that one piece was  couple inches wider than the other.

Creature-wise, remove Putrid Lamasu, Soul Consuming Wraith, Moonsilk Spider, Dark Wood Hermit, Moonsilk Spinner, Fate Spinner and Plague Zombie. None of these creatures are good enough. Make room for better creatures

Cut the Fate Weaver too. It require too high of a Might requirement to justify being in your deck. Doing so should lower your cost curve, allowing your deck to come out better. 

Get four Decay Spitter. The card is arguably the best Necropolis creature and you've got one. Other creatures to consider are Hangman Tree, Untamed Wraith, Lingering Ghost and Soul-Consuming Lich due to their synergy with Earthquake and due to being just pretty resilient creatures overall. For the opposite reason, I'll equal into question the desirability of Dark Assassins in that deck. Ariana is good in good part due to her access to earth magic, which most Necropolis creatures can often survive easily. 

I'll leave to you to decide what amount of the remaining creature you need.

Spell-wise, there's a bit of clean up to do. Earth's Grasp in a deck with Pao Deathseaker makes no sense. Considering that the Paos with the deck, remove Earth's Grasp. Remove Death Seal, Gate to Nowhere, Silent Death, Cursed Bond, Symbiotic Barkskin and Spell Twister. None of these cards are good enough to warrant the slot. Remove Puppet Master too. While a good card, it's too slow for what you're trying to do. Get at least one more Insect Swarm, get 2-3 Town Portal, get four Earthquake and increase to four Soulreaver. 

Finally, event-wise, get four Week of Taxes since you run no fortune. For the rest, include at 2-4 Week of the Mercenaries and 0-1 of Cosmic Balance and Rise of the Nethermancer. "

Zexks,feedthebeast,1388766891.0,"TLDR: Not every player can handle the repetition of end game progression extending mods. Worlds don't tend to last long enough for substantial world progression to take place, who will want to spend so much on any one world knowing they'll replace in a few months with the next update.

No matter what you do with the tech mods, someone, eventually everyone, will figure out the direct line to the top and the most efficient way to get there. Then it simply becomes a game of how can you get on that track with the world you are given and how quickly can you progress on it (ie: how lucky are you for resources at the start of the new world).

Magic mods spread this out a bit more, by generally requiring that you either advance in levels by using the skills or seek out new knowledge by exploring. Both things require extended time out in the world and away from the crafting grid and your machines. This offers a sense of extended progression because it's more time based, ie: not something you can build a contraption to throw resources at and complete in a matter of minutes. The problem here is the same though, eventually you learn everything there is to learn about the magic and then it's back to the users mind to come up with goals and uses for the new tools.

Mods like millinaire and galacticraft, to a lesser extent, offer up goals and new/different environments in which to place the constructs all the other mods give. For me the problem with galacticraft is that basically once you've built your space station, building on other planets is not all that much different than building new bases away from you main on the Overworld. Millinaire on the other hand offers and endless set of goals and objectives and is truly one of the best mods in this direction. Every new village has the chance to be a new base of adventures.

The new EndGame mod that just came out is a great start for this kind of concept but I fear that it will lead to even larger factories designed to create resources proportional to it's demand and simply serve to increase lag. It also doesn't offer the kind of world changing visible feed back that millinair offers in new buildings and expanding villages. That is what a lot of people who are into objective based game play are looking for. A way to show that our interaction with the world and the completion of these goals has a real effect on that world, beyond carving great holes in the landscape.

If I stop in a village and drop millions of bricks and iron and other resources into it, I want to see expansion, defenses, specializations, skyscrappers, general growth of the place I'm pouring mystcraft ages worth of resources into. Part of that problem is the vanilla villager mechanic requiring so many doors for new villages.

Maybe it's just me but I think it would quite awesome. But even then you run into the issue of quests boiling down to semi-repetative gathering quests. And where a mod author sets his time component based on say 100 bread an hour, players will build factories to produce 1000 an hour breaking his/her intended mechanic. On top of that once a player has upgraded one village what is the incentive to move on and do the same to another when the mods and MC in general are progressing at a quarterly rate. Making the time window for a world a few months at best. Then what are the players to do."

From what I understand the idea is to have a rifle capable of taking a variety of game with a single gun; since the scarcity of game in Europe means you're more likely to shoot whatever you happen to come across.  For this reason, having a gun that is capable of shooting birds, small game, deer, or boar, is superior to a firearm that is meant for only one class of game.

If one shot is all you can reasonably expect to get off before you see another animal, why not have it in a firearm style that is notorious for being very quick pointing; and expensive."

&gt; Be thankful that you have someone to miss and that someone thousands of miles away is willing to be lonely today in the hopes that one day you'll be together. It's rare to find people so willing to sacrifice some of their happiness in the present in order to be happier in the future.

This quote made me smile and made me appreciate that my SO is probably struggling missing me badly, too. He is willing to be lonely today in order to be with me together some day in the future.

Also, talk to your SO. Sometimes we just have bad days, see too many other happy couples around, need a shoulder to cry on, need a hug/kiss to make everything right again. We all know how that feels, but remember its temporary! Be determined. Look at how far you and SO has come. Could you bear to give it all up now?

Use a really good, thick-cut bread. Most grocery stores have a bakery, so get a nice loaf and either have them slice it thick, or cut it yourself. Lightly toast it, so it's still soft but has a little bit of crunch to it.

Watch the order of your ingredients. Isolate the tomato from the bread with Mayo or lettuce. Put Mustard directly onto the meat or cheese. Wendy's sandwiches use this order, working from the top bun to the burger- White, Red, Green, White, Red, Green, Yellow (Mayo, Ketchup, Pickle, Onion, Tomato, Lettuce, Mustard).

Somewhere beyond the dirt encrusted treeline and over the horizon was a world that had nothing to offer, not even a drop of gas to keep the generator going. Maybe a couple days of power left if I conserved. The feeling of cold metal in my hands probably the only thing keeping me grounded. At first I had grabbed it for a sense of protection, to protect myself and the things I thought valuable. But now, as I count each of my breaths and each setting sun, the gun offers a sense of guaranteed escape.  
  
Yesterday I had decided to flip the generator on. After waiting well over a week huddled under a mass of quilted blankets and a couple couch cushions for good measure, the desire to grasp for something familiar overtook me. I curled up in front of my laptop and brought up my music to fill in the empty space that had grabbed the room by the throat. It wasn't until I was half way through a page of endless ""Z's"" when I heard the beep come from my speakers. It had been so long since I'd heard that sound, I'd assumed it was a dead memory. With a couple clicks I had pulled up the minimized internet page, a fresh email waiting to be opened in my inbox despite the non-existence of the internet all together.

""Hey, remember me? I don't really know how to write this, or if you'll even have this email by the time it's suppose to send to you. Maybe this website won't even exist - who knows. 10 years is a long time. Either way, it's me. You. Us. Hi. At this point, you're really wondering where the hell your life is going. You're sitting alone in your t-shirt and underwear while eating a bowl of popcorn. That is all that is happening right now. Okay, we'll turn on some music:  
  
All in all, today, I believe that there is something in my future for me. A life built with a loved one and a couple of kids. Maybe I can finally take a trip to a set of southern islands somewhere in the middle of the ocean and waste away an entire week of my life the right way. Everyone around you this morning got into an argument about the president - you hate him, they like him. Go figure. Same argument as before and nobody wants to admit they made a mistake. We'll see what they say one day when the whole world has gone to shit. Sure won't be 'I told you so.'  
  
Really, maybe the world is going to end. Maybe everyone will die, and you can finally live the life of solitude you've dreamt of so many nights while lying awake in bed. It's hell here. The turmoil of everyday shit that never ceases to pile upon itself. Though, I'm making it. You're making it. We're gonna make it. Hell, maybe you'll get this as the last person on earth. Then again, that would be the worst imaginable hell I could picture.  
  
A lifetime of loneliness ahead of us, and only a fucking email to carry us on.

Like it or not, his followers/fans *did/do* view him as a member of the Minnesota Vikings. When he writes articles using language like ""cockmonster"" and ""hot dong action,"" I think the Vikings are well within their rights to *ask* him to tone it down. Kluwe is passionate about noble causes, but he wasn't a professional. It seems to me like Kluwe's activism is more about him remaining in the spotlight than anything else.

All it comes down to is this:

If Kluwe is right, other witnesses will come out and support his claims.

If Kluwe is a liar, he'll be sued and end up homeless.

Either way, I just want this to be over. True or not, Kluwe's claims only hurt the team I love. It's a he-said-he-said spat that, in my opinion, Kluwe should have taken directly to Zygi Wilf *in private.*

""Hey Zyg, Priefer is a dick, and here's why. Fire him. If you don't, I'll publish this article."" 

Is that underhanded? Sure. Is it better for our organization that creating a shitstorm of these epic proportions? Hell yes.

Fuck Mike Priefer if he is in fact a homophobic douche. But fuck Chris Kluwe for being a loudmouth bitch and embroiling an entire team in a scandal of epic proportions. I hate this shit. I just want to do regular offseason shit like designing dumbass new uniforms, arguing over obscure stats, and talking about which ear our new coach wears his headset on."

banana-tree,Turkey,1388767355.0,"I forgot to add - I really appreciate the positive thoughts about Turkey and the outcome of the current crisis. People are a bit too sensitive about secularism*, and that sometimes comes out against Arab countries as they fear the influence. I don't have a problem with Turkey having stronger relationships with Arabic countries, but it doesn't seem to me that Erdoğan is doing a very good job at that either. Then again, I don't understand ME politics very well, so I'll hope I'm wrong and stay out of that.

I don't know what the current level of support is, but I don't think it has shifted too significantly (personal impression, no data). Support for AKP is probably still around 45-50%, closer to but not above 50%. Harder to tell the distribution among the opposition. There are local elections coming up in three months, we'll see what the polls show and how things work out.

*edit: I, too, think secularism is very important. I just think some of the sensitivities are unfounded, or exaggerated. [We talked a bit about that here earlier](http://www.reddit.com/r/Turkey/comments/1tewgi/need_something_explained_re_edrogan_and_fethullah/ce7oi6m?context=5).

Second, no variation in type colors. Apart from cases where it's white over a black background, all text is black, no matter its hierarchy or importance. Putting less-prominent bits such as author names, ""posted on"" dates, etc in a grey might go a long way to making it easier on the eye."

The church of the congregation in question is/was on 6th b/w 1st and 2nd Ave on the North side of the street.  It's now a synagogue after years of changing ownership / denominations.

The 2nd Ave area is now ""dominated"" by Ukrainian and Polish ethnic groups.  I was chatting with a realtor who's family has been in the area for many generations.  He explained that the Germans were the prosperous ethnic group in the area: fantastic craftmakers, bakers, butchers, etc.  But after this disaster, which killed many of the community's elite, the fabric of the society was just torn open.  Anguish swept through, and the Germans couldn't take it -- many/most moved up to Yorkville and elsewhere.

The Polish / Ukrainain swept in, buying up many of the buildings in fire-sales, and they continue to have a significant footprint on the community to this day.  There are still a bunch of restaurants, diners, community centers, bars, bakeries, etc. in the area.

Very interesting stuff.  That was back when the construct of an ""ethnic neighborhood"" still carried with it the idea of an one-for-all type of unity and bond."

- The economy will be better by then because of all the growth that will happen between now and then.

- But if you are taxing savings to pay interest on the debt, that doesn't really grow the economy.

However cheeky ""banter"" comments like this are an incredibly dangerous area to go into. Yes, most would just be fine with it, but if someone does get offended, like Lallana apparently was, then you just insulted someone from a position of superiority where they can't respond to you in kind. Legally, if I said something that offended a kid, and they decided to something about it, I'd probably be in trouble, because I just abused a position of authority.

Within a week of being home without me, he set himself on a schedule. I nursed him right before I left for work (around 7:20 we'd start - I would offer even if he showed no feeding cues), he'd take a bottle of pumped milk around 10 am (when I would pump), I would come home to feed him at lunch, bottle/pump around 3, and feed him as soon as I got home at 5:10-5:15. When he didn't see me, hear me, or smell me all day he was more easily influenced into that routine.

When he hit growth spurts and was teething he might take more milk, either two bottles in succession or two spaced out bottle feedings at ""off"" times like 9 or 9:30 am and maybe 10:30 am, for example. My husband was/is really good with feedings.

Finally, despite all of their power and tech, time lords are really bad at understanding the nature of and dealing with new threats. The Daleks have shown us that. If they were to view the forces of chaos on some other planet, and the scout that viewed those forces wasn't immediately corrupted, they'd be likely to assume that they themselves are incorruptible.

I work with kids on the spectrum for a living (as well as diagnosing them). Please recognize that the risk for girls is almost equivalent to boys due to girls more likely getting an incorrect diagnosis of ADHD (since girls are more naturalistically empathetic).

However, we didn't *lose anyone on defense due to the penalty*. Defense wasn't ""targeted"" because *nothing* was targeted. Contracts were just restructured so they could keep the current roster without any major changes. And this was *after* a couple years had already passed to help the defense transition to 3-4.

I'd love to hear your substantiation, but you've yet to provide any at all. All you've done is try to insult me and repeat your unsupported argument that it takes time to transition to 3-4 and the cap penalty was ""overwhelmingly targeted"" on the defense.

On the subject of aging, I agree with /u/jimbles1. With the changes that have come to meadmaking in the last decade or so, it's possible to have great mead that is younger than 6 months old.

If it's already great at 6 months, maybe it will be the best you've ever had at 1 year, fundamentally redefine your expectations for mead in 5 years, or grant you enlightenment in 12 years?"

Hoodwink,OneY,1388768019.0,"I think there's plenty of men who want to be a stay-at-home-Dad.  Based on the fact that most men think it seems like a pretty easy job these days.  

The main problem I think is number 3.  You need to really think about what goes into this - men with higher incomes can get better women, but women can't do the same (when thinking about attraction).  What kind of smart man doesn't have a higher-income job?  And if he doesn't, he's probably in his parent's basement or in a shack in the woods.  

Active men have a lot of younger, hotter, women to choose from and men aren't particularly attracted to women with good jobs like women are.  To be honest, she's probably going for men who have options and she probably hasn't practiced her femininity if she's a career woman.

Men are not looking for another man in a relationship.  

She should look at men who are stuck in retail/waitering/whatever - many men swoop in to take these women as wives.  Or find a male teacher (they always seem to be single because their income sucks).

Men would love to be stay-at-home-dads.  The career-women I have met seem to think stay-at-home-woman are taking advantage of their husbands / leeches (maybe not as harsh, but their outlook is somewhat like that).  So these women don't want a lazy leech - they want to marry a doctor/CEO/accountant and get him to quit. "

Erisari,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1388768058.0,"Oh you're welcome! I definitely think that the Surface is a great link between a tablet and laptop. I'm going to be using it in place of my laptop for taking class notes. Although, I think that the keyboard will take getting used to.  

My SO, who is a computer programmer guy, is not familiar with the Surface gestures or anything about it really (which I find astonishing because he is my tech guru). I had to figure it out on my own. So, I played with the Surface for about 2 days straight, downloaded a bunch of stuff, and watched videos on how to personalize and such.

I find it easier to learn when I'm hands on and when other people show me (or tell me) how to do it. I figured I can share what I've learned with you :)

As a side note - I just figured out, if you use iTunes or have music playlists on your computer, that you can just copy your iTunes folder right into your music folder on your Surface (or any Windows 8 PC) and import those playlists so you don't have to do them again! It's an option in the Windows Music App (the one that came on the Surface)."

I get what you're saying, but the subtle point I'm trying to make is that any guy who wants to get good at dating needs to remember first that a) she chose the other guy, and then the idea that b) MAYBE it's not his fault is secondary to that, and not always true.

If you make rules about these exceptions where the girl goes back to her ex (I've never seen this happen with guys who knew their shit), and you say ""well, it's not your fault,"" you might be right 5 or 10 percent of the time. But the other 90 percent, you might be telling a guy that his game doesn't need any work when really it could have turned out in his favor.

I mean, the situations where a girl is conditioned by systematic abuse are really not that prevalent. And, honestly, in those cases, I agree with you. But, again, minority of cases, so we have to be very specific about how this advice only applies to those cases."

I lived with my parents for a while but I had a separate entrance, guys didn't even need to know.  Do you have situation where you can bring girls home without it being a problem?  I had one guy bring me home and I thought he lived in a basement apartment like I did.  Nope, I had to meet his entire family and they all told me not to break his heart etc, this was the third date and it was extremely off putting.

mysticfishstic,DIY,1388768418.0,I sell pole barns for a living. Our actual barn doors have a cam over latch on the inside of the door to keep it pulled tight against the barn and locked. Opening/closing the door from the inside is not a problem on a typical barn. The thing most people don't think about when trying to use this type of door is you have to have the same amount of space for the door to slide as the door is wide. So if the door is 3' wide you will need 3' free for the door to slide open or a total of 6' of total space. Also you have the track that the door hangs from that can be somewhat ugly. I can link some pics of the inside of our sliding doors if you would like.

This is only compounded by involving a person's mind breaking. There's no way you can't anticipate what comes next. When Walker realized what had been done to his family, what they took from them during the war, not a soul could have anticipated he would take the device and seek vengeance.  

Humanity has 3 devices known only to a hand full of people that enable one person to travel between space and time. They came about by accident, when NASA was working on warp speed technology. They had only ever been used once officially. To assist in the Police investigation following the events in Boston, in April of 2013. The second...The second was Walker. I would be the third. 

We knew where Walker was going. Berlin 1942. His plan was simple, and rather cliche in terms of what to do with Time Travel. Kill Hitler. I was being sent to stop him from doing this. We needed Hitler to survive to preserve the world we now know. 

Among the Third Reich's secrets was one so large, that only the people who run my division are allowed to know it. The fact that Joseph Goebbels had secretly been amassing a small following, and was close to obtaining a nuclear device without Hitler's knowledge. The only thing stopping him was Adolf Hitler. Goebbels tried numerous times to kill Hitler, each one a failure. If Walker were to take Hitler out, it would give Goebbels the perfect opportunity to step in and unleash total nuclear war on North America and Europe. 

I'm being sent back to keep Hitler alive to stop the worst war humanity would ever know. Go figure. Here's hoping I get there in time.

Having four people interact with her will be a challenge: everyone has to agree on how to handle her behavior or it's all for not.

What works best for us, we always speak calmly to her no matter what her behavior becomes.

We offer physical comfort which nine times out of ten helps after a few minutes. Just because you console them doesn't mean what you said changes even if they're upset.

wittyb,electronic_cigarette,1388768724.0,"It sounds like what you're looking for is a good throat hit, with little flavor.  That is something of an oxymoron in this hobby, but it might be possible.

What you're probably going to want is a high Propylene Glycol (PG) content with enough nicotine to give you a kick.

Most liquids are an 80/20 (PG/VG) mix, with variable nicotine levels.  As I understand it, some VG is necessary to stabilize and thicken the PG, so that it doesn't all just flow straight into your battery.  80/20 is probably a good place to start. 

The trick is that the higher the nicotine content, the stronger the flavors come out of the juice.  I suspect if you looked hard enough, you could probably find an unflavored bottle at the nicotine strength that you want.  Or, call your local B&amp;M to find out if they may be willing to mix you a little test batch, if they do their own liquids.  If they're willing, I'd get a couple of strengths, ranging between 18-25%.  This should give you the immense throat hit it sounds like you want, with no artificial flavor.  Trouble is, I don't know what raw nicotine juice would taste like.

Now, if ""blue"" has become the universal color for ""light cigarette"" then the trouble there may be that even 18% is too high of a nicotine content for your body to take all at once.  If you start getting headaches, upset stomach, and generally feeling woozy, the nic content is too high for your body, and you'll want to cut back.

They say that 18% is a good starting point for a pack-a-day reds smoker, or a pack+ a day lights smoker.  If you're not getting woozy, but still not satisfied, try a higher nic content.

Now, there are a lot of flavors out there that are fairly subtle.  I hate to keep pushing you to drive 20 miles, but it would likely be worth your time to go out and test everything until you find that bit that suits you.  But most reputable vape shops have 0 (or low) nic liquid in their testers.  So it's possible that something that seems to meet your palate in the tester will blow your tongue out of your mouth with the nicotine in it.  Again, ask.  They may be willing to let you sample a flavor at a higher nic content, so you can find the real taste.

It seems like I've covered the hardware enough that I'm giving you the best subjective advice I can.  The only thing left is to get juice into an atomizer, and go until you've found that one that works.  Understand that this is a process, and achieving exactly what your mouth wants in a vaping experience is the equivalent of finding your own personal holy grail.  For the most part, the majority of us have ""settled"" on a flavor that satisfies, but we're always looking for that perfect one.  Also, keep in mind that your palate will change as your taste buds come back to life, and this ""perfect juice"" may be a moving target for the rest of the time you spend vaping."

LadyTexas,AskWomen,1388768736.0,"I recently ended a friendship that started 20+ years ago in seventh grade. Not sure what happened initially, but she started being distant early last year. Not just with me, but with everyone. I tried to be there for her and she would never answer texts or phone calls. 

Later in the year, she was mad at me for being friends with her ex on Facebook. I guess you count him as an ex if he was the guy she cheated on her now-husband with... in high school, which was almost 17 years ago. She is not mad at everyone else who is friends with him, including nearly everyone we were friends with back then. Just me.

She is also mad that I did not send her daughter a graduation present. I clearly remember saying that I would send a card, and she told me I did not need to to that. I got busy with summer semester of grad school and it slipped my mind. Apparently, I *did* need to do that.

So for these heinous things I have done, she stopped speaking to me. I only found out what the hell was going on when a friend finally confessed that they had been told all this, plus some other fun crap, but held off telling me so they could avoid getting in the middle of it. I sent her a cordial email ending the friendship. Only reason I know she got the email was that her daughter unfriended me on FB. To that, I say AMF.

Our mutual friends are pretty fed up with her and I imagine it won't be long before others fade out of her life. We might see each other next month at a divorce party, though. This is the South, so I will call upon my manners, be polite, and not shame my family by having a Jersey Shore-style cat fight.

Bless her heart."

""Thrown into this living hell. 
I was thrown into this living hell. 
I am the hatred taken from another's life. 
Born unwanted, extracted of all that is humane. 
No one can relate to my abandonment. 
I walk this earth alone in search of salvation. 
Forever, Forever. Forever. Alone. 
A tormented seed given a chance to grow. 
The end result of moral choice. 
Only to live a tortured life as the product of rape. 
Under a mother's face of innocence, 
And a father with eyes of a demon. 
Conceived through an act of violence. (4x)

Go to: Grand Rapids Allergy, 970 Parchment Dr, Grand Rapids, MI. They know their stuff and the head lady doctor updates her education regularly. (Her father founded the office.) http://www.grandrapidsallergy.com/

ActingPower,MLPAnalysis,1388768912.0,"EDIT: I suppose I didn't answer your question. My point is and was that there are good and bad episodes of season 1. But there are also good and bad episodes of season 2, 3, and 4. The question of ratio is unmeasurable, really, unless you can objectively say that the amount of ""bad"" episodes is statistically significantly more in the season of your distaste.

...Why am I still arguing with you? I thought I had already said this was a matter of opinion.

Anywho, there's this term some people use called ""Jumping the Shark."" Basically, the mindset behind the show has changed so fundamentally that the show no longer engages the same way and thus isn't enjoyable. For example, after the Spongebob movie, all of the characters started backsliding deeper and deeper into idiocy. A slow process, but one with immediate ties to the movie, which outright changed Spongebob from a child to an adult. Or, as the other well-known example, ""Family Matters"" started focusing more and more on Steve Urkel, to the detriment of the show. 

The question, then, is whether FiM has jumped the shark. In my opinion, season 3 did a good job of telling interesting stories while bringing back things bronies wanted to see. Has season 4 misstepped? Is it darker, meme-ier, more adventure-focused? Most critically, is it unredeemable? That will have to wait for the rest of the episodes."

&gt;But while China has managed for centuries to remain self-sufficient, it will not be able to do so in the future. **Ten per cent of the Chinese population is estimated to be undernourished,** the rural labour force is declining, and agricultural productivity is increasingly vulnerable to climate change, natural disasters and water shortages. For planning purposes, China must have at least 120 million hectares of arable land to produce enough food to meet future demands. But around two-thirds of available land in China is now classified as either barren or low in agricultural potential, and smallholder Chinese farmers are leaving the land.

Also, on the Global Food Security Index, china ranks 38th, with a score of 62/100 (see page 9-10, warning PDF):

That wasn't what I was attempting to demonstrate at all.  I was demonstrating that a movie that is unabashedly sexist and exists entirely to tantalize and titillate men could easily pass the Bechdel Test.

&gt; I'm imagining the latter of the movie not taking women seriously as I haven't finished it yet, of course.

Oh wow, I wasn't expecting you to actually watch that.

&gt;Tell me, and I'll up the ante on this one, what was the last action movie you saw, or can even think of, featuring a black woman as the protagonist?

Catwoman with Halle Berry, but that's totally cheating.  A **black** woman?  If you want to argue that America is a racist country, I'm not going to try to change your view.  But a racist country and patriarchal country are not the same thing.

Don't be like that, white girl.  Don't try to wrap yourself up in racial oppression and act like being a woman in America is anything at all like being black in America.  That's the **worst** thing about modern feminism, the way it encourages so many middle-class white women to count themselves amongst the oppressed by taking on race and sexuality based oppressions and making them their own, when the reality is that they have far more in common with the oppressor than the oppressed.

* The combined 12v rail load is only 37A (444W). 

* Average voltage reg.

* Mediocre ripple/noise suppression.

1. So in conclusion, *if* you stick with mid-range GPUs (150W or less at peak draw), I think you are probably still ok. But personally - I would make the investment **now** to get a better quality PSU. Something like a Rosewill Capstone 450W or 550W ($69 or $75, respectively), which you can carry over through your next upgrades/builds. The 270X draws 122W at peak. Similar performance cards (7870, GTX 660) draw 115W and 118W, respectively.

2. GPU - assuming you're only gaming at 1080P, I would definitely move up a few tiers so you have a very noticeable increase in performance. For something in the $200s, I would recommend the [270X](http://techreport.com/review/25466/amd-radeon-r9-280x-and-270x-graphics-cards/11).

Luckily, I've seen mine for years, and before I decided to seek her out again as an adult, went to her when I was younger for what she thought was depression back then. If you were truly diagnosed, the key is to make sure you make it very clear that you are not trying to take these just for studying, like students do. That makes you seem desperate. If you are actually looking for treatment, talk about long term things, how you feel lately, what your average day is like without it, and how you think it will help. 

I went off my meds for almost a year, and just recently started getting back on them, and holy hell do I wish I never stopped treatment, cuz now I have to start all over again. Just be honest, let your doc get to know you, see what he has to say on the matter, and take suggestions. Be sure to let him know if you have anxiety, get overly emotional, if you ever got really angry (which is common with things like adderall and Ritalin), whether you are depressed, etc. There are a TON of different meds out there now that can treat a variety of things, and often times you will find that if you really do have ADHD, you will have a slight form of other stuff as well (for example, mine is severe anxiety).

Eriamjh1138,nutrition,1388769537.0,"And so you have learned a great lesson: Different products can vary WILDLY in their actual contents and makeup.  Don't be blinded (or fooled) but buzzphrases such as **92% Fat Free** or **44g of whole grain**.  Look at total Calories, Fat (each type), Carbs (and sugar), Protein, Fiber, and Sodium.

Since these are European labels, it might be harder to also be aware of one key measurement: what a serving is.  In Europe, the content is typically shown as 100g or 150g, but who has a scale on them?  What's really important is how many servings are in a package.  

In the USA, this is required.  Sometimes a serving is just what you get (one bar, one bag, one cookie), but other times, there are 2, 3 or more in a package.  So don't think your bag of Cheetos is only 150 calories when the are 2.5 servings (375 cals) in the whole bag!

Pay attention and you'll be better informed and better controlled."

They don't want women in combat positions, but they want women to have to sign up for Selective Services. All while claiming women DONT have to because of Feminism, which is laughable. Especially considering Feminists are generally 100% against Selective Services all together.

They don't want women in combat positions, but they're obsessed with the idea that more women need to die in war for things to be ""fair"".

They don't want women in combat positions because apparently ALL women are weak beauty queens who will pout on the frontlines and distract the whole troupe and get everyone killed trying to save her and all while she menstruates and leaves a 5-gallon trail of blood that attacks all the grizzly bears in Afghanistan. 

Put it all together in a stew and ignore the fact that BEFORE it became legal to put women on the frontlines they were screaming about the fact that women were ""protected"" from combat roles. Which is misandry.

In conclusion it really just sounds like these fuckers want dead women because....reasons.

Unlike a lot of other plants, marijuana has two distinct sexes,  the female is the desired plant. Selective interbreeding, as is also done with other plants, results in slight to dramatic differences in offspring, creating new varietals. With most plants, tomatoes, apples etc., every seed is variation on the mother plant. Some variations are useful, others maybe not so much. Selective breeding can be used to try and preserve certain qualities, or what is more commonly done is to root cuttings, thereby creating a new plant that is genetically identical to the original plant.  
  
**EDIT:**  I should also mention that how the plant is grown, harvested and cured, determines a great deal of the finished products characteristics. Any specific plant is going to come with it's own limited genetic potential. A good gardener will learn how to maximize that potential."

BlatantFix,soccer,1388769582.0,"&gt; You're essentially saying that Clattenburg should be expected to take the higher ground. I'd agree with that, but Southampton didn't quietly say ""We're unhappy about the attitude taken and would appreciate it not being repeated"", they outright requested that Clattenburg should not referee their games pending a review, which is an accusation that he referees unfairly. That's about as big a claim that can be made against referees.

Fair play, certainly wouldn't deny it's an overreaction, and you're right it is kind of an attack on Clattenburg's character. 

Still though, it's the kind of thing you get into in that situation, the vast majority of people won't really have a problem with what Clattenburg did, but the fact he is he has offended someone when he shouldn't be. It's why comments like that are a dangerous thing in the first place, you open yourself up to this kinda nonsense. And without knowing much about Lallana as a person seems a bit harsh to lump on him the behaviour of all footballers, I'm sure plenty are utter twats but it doesn't really mean to dismiss one being offended because of the behaviour of the rest of them."

1. If you're an attorney, you'll be accused of trying to implement ""guild law"" on non-guild members, which (just like every other type of law apparently) can only be done by contract. This arises out of a whole 'nother complicated conspiracy theory that attorneys are members of a British royal order, the London Bar, and that all law done by lawyers is the guild law of the London Bar. There's a whole offshoot of that dealing with a supposedly lost Amendment to the Constitution that would cast lawyers out of public office, but that's a different story.

2. They just ignore you and yell their OPCA script louder. This is most common when dealing with judges. I saw a guy on trial for a car registration issue repeatedly talking about his refusal to consent to the court, put ""without prejudice"" and ""all rights reserved"" before every question he asked witnesses (an outgrowth of the UCC thing), and basically yelled over the judge whenever he attempted to explain the guy's *actual* rights.

They told me that if I wanted an allowance, I would need to write up a monthly budget plan and propose it to them. We then sat down and went through it, they pointed out areas they thought were excessive, or expenses they thought I missed (I was 14 so my expenses were minimal of course). Then they made me track my spending in a notebook. If I ever wanted a raise in my allowance, I basically need to put together a new proposal, showing how I've been spending my money and justify why I needed more.

I remember thinking this was the DUMBEST thing at the time, when my friends' parents just handed them money whenever they asked for it, but looking back, it made it much easier for myself when I first went out on my own and already had the habits of tracking and examining my spending.

If you were pressuring my team and i had a chance to shoot the puck out of my zone, i would. every time. it would make the whole team have to skate all the way down to the other end of the ice. It would be a broken game without it. Thats why the offending team on an icing call is not allowed to change any players. Mostly, the puck can only be carried down the ice as a player stick handles. although once a player carries the puck across centre ice, he may dump the puck into the other end without getting called on icing. 

Offsides are important as the puck must enter the teams zone before any opposing players may enter. Otherwise i would stand in front of their goalie and wait for the puck to come in

Also one thing you never asked about is Hand passes. A player may not use his hand to throw or pass or carry the puck, but you ARE allowed to grab it out of the air, and drop it to your own stick, then resume playing with a stick. "

&gt; I may be misunderstanding a bit and I'm far from a comp-sec expert but; if your Pi is at your house and mine is at my house, if I opened an SSH tunnel from my Pi to your Pi would it not still be going out through my internet port (and so my ""WAN"" IP address) and coming in via yours?

There is only one Pi, and two other computers. The computers both SSH into the Pi as the central point to leave and pickup messages.

So there isn't a direct IP to IP transmission at all.
&gt;
&gt; So the metadata wouldn't be exigenesis@reddit.com[1] to CC_EF_JTF@reddit.com[2] but would be &lt;exigenesis IP&gt; -&gt; &lt;CC_EF_JTF IP&gt;. I guess it wouldn't be obvious that what I'd sent was, in effect, an e-mail; but NSA etc would still know I had delivered something to you?

That's what I'm trying to determine, if to the NSA this would look similar to an email or not. As I understand it, an email goes from computer to email server, from email server to email server, then to the recipient's computer. You have to trust the connection to the servers and between the servers.

This system wouldn't be using the SMTP servers at all, it would go from computer to Pi to computer, and it wouldn't be sending a piece of data like an email, but instead connecting by SSH directly - using keys - and sending or receiving files. Does the process of SSH into a remote server, and sending / receiving files, look similar to an email? 
&gt;
&gt; I guess a VPN or, like you say, Tor etc could be used to obfuscate even further.
&gt; 
&gt; Dunno, just thinking aloud :-)

Appreciate it. I think both computers would use Tor (preferably Tails as well), but I think the Pi could be made into a Tor hidden service too. But I'm not good enough to test it.

I have a Pi so I might test this out this overall idea myself."

prairie_girls,secretsanta,1388770012.0,"I'm someone who does do a ""Secret Santa"" for kids in poverty each Christmas.  This year I got movie passes (with popcorn and soda, of course!) for a sixteen-year-old boy, and a backpack (into which I tucked lots of treats) for a nine-year-old girl.  Last year I was partnered with an older teen boy and his adult mom, both of whom wanted personal care products (I got mom a hair dryer, which she noted she didn't have, and a bunch of shampoo, conditioner and styling products, and I got the boy a huge gift basket of stuff I picked myself- cologne, body wash, deodorant, razor and lots of blades, etc.).  Shopping for these families is quite possibly my favorite part of the holiday season.

However, if I wanted to give even more gifts without receiving anything back I would be SS for a third or fourth or fifth child in need.  I enjoyed making two children's Christmas better and getting nothing in return.  When I signed up for the Reddit SS it was because I wanted to do an exchange, not make an additional donation.  I've done really great online gift exchanges in the past and never seen a community of people **not** do the right thing and participate for the right reasons like I'm seeing here on Reddit.  I am pretty confident that a gift is on its way to me, but I will be disappointed if nothing arrives.  

I honestly believe that most people who shafted their recipients did so more out of apathy than out of deliberate malice.  I can imagine a lot of eighteen-year-old guys sitting at their computers, realizing they've been matched with forty-year-old Francophone women in Northern Quebec and thinking it's easier to just play video games than find and ship a gift for Béatrice in Whapmagoostui qui aime faire des gâteaux et lire des livres à son neveu, whatever the fuck that means.  I would be highly interested in seeing a demographic breakdown of those who didn't ship a gift; I suspect there would be strong trends in age, sex and nationality.  "

I was friends with her ex-boyfriend, and promised that after their breakup I would remain friends with both of them.  No one had a problem with this.  All of our mutual friends were awesome, we were all ok together.

She got a new boyfriend and then got angry that we didn't like him immediately.  Details about her secret self came out and I felt betrayed, as I trusted her with most of my secrets, and she didn't trust me the same way.  

She said many things that hurt me, without even realizing that it would hurt.  The final straw was when she said, ""I won't remember to call you, so you're going to have to call me.""  I called her once and texted her once.  

It hasn't really been a problem with our mutual friends, since they all liked her first boyfriend and chose him.  I rarely run into her as we live about twenty miles away from each other and she would never drive it.  She never understood why anyone would want to leave our small town.  "
