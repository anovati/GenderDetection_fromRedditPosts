ninjapizza,MSAccess,1389837747.0,"When the first IIF statement returns false, the second part of the expression is calculated. So  

    IIF(3&gt;2, True, IIf(3&gt;1, True, False))  

Would ask the following questions, Firstly, Is 3 Greater then 2? - If it was it would return True at this point, but because it isn't true it then does another IIF statement asking if 3 is Greater then 1 and evaluates that option.  

In your example above you would have the following to make it work.  

    Iif([PT_Score]&lt;=75,[PT_Date]+42,Iif(([PT_Score] &lt; 90) AND ([PT_SCore] &gt;75),[PT_Date]+180,[PT_Date]+365))

This works out first if their score was less then or equal to 75 (Don't forget the &lt;= because there might be a fringe case where their PT_Score was exactly 75 in which case none of the above would true if you just used &gt;) Then it returns the Date+42 as requested.  
If that wasn't a true statement it then looks at the next IIF statement, which is actually two statements in one. If PT_Score &gt; 75 AND &lt; 90 Then it evaluates this section for you. If this is FALSE it will go to the next section."

wiseIdiot,explainlikeimfive,1389837800.0,"&gt; The United States went through a Sexual Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s, and out of that revolution, the current society, where sex is accepted and not particularly a taboo subject, was formed organically. India, however, never went through the Sexual Revolution. Instead, what India had was a sexually repressed society that was all of a sudden inundated with Western media, media which was more open and accepting of sex.

Funny thing. I live in Kerala (one of the southernmost states in India if you didn't know) and recently there has been a lot of movies made here that try to disregard the taboo on the topic of sex. Popular media loves to make fun of these attempts. These kind of movies have earned themselves the label ""new generation"" and these days that phrase is used as an insult. Kind of depressing really.

ScubaSteeeve,Trombone,1389837800.0,"You're correct that most bass trombones have two valves these days, but it's actually the bore size that determines if it's a bass or tenor trombone. Its bell is also likely a bit larger than a standard tenor trombone.

As someone who plays all the low brass instruments (as well as trumpet), the main difference between trombone and euphonium technique-wise is that on trombone, legato tonguing is a much bigger issue. On a valved instrument, the change between fingerings is imperceptible to the human ear because, in part, the half-closed valve doesn't allow air to pass through. Thus, when playing a slurred passage, you don't have to tongue every single note. On trombone, however, you do, unless it's a lip slur or a trigger change (and even then, some teachers I've had recommended using legato tonguing in those instances as well). If your typical tonguing sounds like ""tah,"" your legato tonguing will sound more like ""lah"" or ""dah.""

Also, and you may already know this, the trigger is the equivalent of your fourth valve on the euphonium. It's not compensating; when you're using it, your slide positions will have to adjust as well as you move the slide outward. First position requires no adjustment; sixth position tends to be about where seventh position would normally be. And since you only have one valve, I sincerely hope you never have to play the B-natural below bass clef."

screenmagnet,sex,1389838012.0,"Here is a subtle way to get the idea across: excuse yourself to the bathroom, and very obviously pull a tampon out of your purse while he is watching. If he is super dense, you can tell him you are out of tampons, and ask him if he has change for the bathroom tampon machine (if you are out at a restaurant for example). Or if you are at his place, you can ask him of it is okay to flush tampons down his toilet or if he prefers that you put it in the wastebasket. Or as you are getting up to go to the bathroom, you can say 'that time of the month again' with a smile.

I would avoid complaining about cramps, since he'll assume that you are in too much pain to have sex.

If you want to be more forward, you could try giving him a naughty smile and tell him that you've been extra horny all day because you are on your period. Or you can ask him if he's got his 'red wings' yet with a wink.

As we get more and more reports there will be higher and higher readings. We may not see the full effects until 5 to 10 years later or even later but will that be to late? Probably.

The thing is there really isn't too much to conspire about Fukushima, it simply is leaking 200-300 tons of radioactive water into the ocean while they try to keep the fuel rods cool and separated. A really bad disaster as worse if not even worse than Chernobyl but it is being contain nor given the global attention it is need because the pacific ocean doesn't just belong to Japan. But some could say that there is a conspiracy to cover up the fact that the Japanese and other governments are claiming this is not so even though there are plenty of scientist speaking out on the matter. Example [Michio Kaku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFs8vMjTL7U). 

Other conspires that could be said are; GE building the Fukushima plant on a fault line, HAARP earthquake, Tepco and the Japanese mafia on the shit fix, other higher ups using this for whatever. You can say anyone planned anything but no matter who did what, we still have a world problem on our hands.

NotTheBatman,DotA2,1389838038.0,"See I don't actually disagree with those people though. I climbed to 4.1k on mostly draft modes. I started hated playing with the same 20/30 heroes every game and waiting 10 minutes for the game to start so went back to all pick and very very quickly fell to 3.6k on a string of losing streaks. I would perform individually fairly well at my role most of those games; good farm when playing carry, frequent warding/ganking/babysitting as support, controlling map well on mids, getting gold and levels on offlanes. 

The problem was I was still in draft mode mindset, where after getting a couple kills everyone would push down towers together and start warding/dewarding aggressively. On carries I would usually get a fast treads/wand/drums, on supports I would be pouring all my money into wards and smokes and urn and mek. The problem is this doesn't do you jack shit in all pick at the level I was playing at. 

I'll get the occasional all pick game where everyone knows how to play their role together and we roll over the other team, but I've learned that when I get an early advantage that money is better spent on midas and late game items. In draft modes games were going 15-30 min and I was winning a majority of those games and climbing ladder very fast (went from 3.6k to 4.1k in under a week). Now that I only play all pick games are practically guaranteed to go over 30 minutes every time, even if every lane wins heavily.

I don't believe that there's an elo hell that you can't escape from if you are better than your MMR, but I do believe that there are players that are much better at team play than typical low level pub play. I've started climbing back up quickly since I've started to play more like a pubstar. I only tp into obviously favorable fights, I farm my ass off regardless all game, I buy my own wards oftentimes regardless off role, and if i'm the strongest early game hero I work my ass off around the map creating space and just praying my carries can farm/itemize well.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389838106.0,"&gt; Ok, so now we've got 20k of income (which many will say is impossibly low, particularly in expensive urban areas) and 10k of medical expenses at an absolute bare minimum. Once medical utilization skyrockets, as any free service will, I think 20k or more would be a more likely figure.

1) My plan is $15k.

2) Most countries overseas spend $3k per citizen on healthcare a year. It'll be very close to 0 for some, might be $10k for others, and prices will drop because the goal will be efficiency, not profit.

&gt;You're proposing roughly tripling our current federal budget without creating any economic growth. It's not even well thought out enough to qualify as madness. It's just something that sounds cool to people that aren't good at math. 

Only if you strawman my plan.

&gt;Oh, so now we're talking about a third big (really big) entitlement program?

It gets phased out. Only people currently 50 or older would have that option.

wienercat,sex,1389838129.0,"There are plenty of informational videos out there on oral. Since you have the problem of injury, best to learn as much as you can from as many mediums as possible. 

Nina Hartley actually puts out some decent educational videos on the big tube sites. I mean they are porn-ish, but her techniques do indeed work and work well. 

Big thing with stuff like oral is just taking it slow. Go slow and build her up. Penetration some women like it rough and fast, but most women say oral is best when you just take your time. 

By tasteful I mean, don't just be sitting there talking and say ""oh yeah, fun fact. I have this injury that makes me lack in the hardness department of an erection."" Just don't be blunt. Be serious and make sure she understands, as it can be difficult to grasp at first. 

Talking about sex with a SO should be normal and safe discussion where nobody has to worry. Getting the topic out there really is as simple as saying, hey we need to talk about something. Then explain said injury. If you are just picking up a girl, then I would say it would be okay to say it once you got back to one of your places. 

What I would advise is just go for relationships. Don't worry about getting laid. Emphasis on a healthy relationship will make that hurdle of sex much easier to get over. Also, don't rush sex in the relationship. It can indeed wait while you two become more comfortable, unless she insists on it then that is the point to have the talk and explain your situation. Again being serious and explaining it is a serious issue for you etc. "

Breklinho,soccer,1389838331.0,"That Americans are treated as second-hand contributors to discussion threads, the ""I'm American but DAE MLS is shit"" crowd and that if you don't have an EPL crest and comment on an EPL trend, player or game your opinion is invalid even though I just watched the same fucking game you did. **The ""nice try Wenger"" comment at the top of the thread every time someone asks about a player**, the polarization of opinions, the incessant downvoting based on justifiable opinions, how everybody is constantly reminded any goal from a game outside of the top six or Champions League would never happen in the Premier League, the EPL centricity of the sub, bullshit rumors being top posts daily and the Bendtner jokes are getting old. The Arsenal circlejerk and the r/soccer-is-an-Arsenal-circlejerk circlejerk, the sympathetic karma whoring, the lack of original jokes because only jokes get upvotes, when people get downvoted for asking an honest question, when people get hostile on a fucking website, how half of the comments on the post linking to Ronaldo's acceptance speech were about how incredibly hot Irina Shayk is, I mean it's 100% true but oh my god every comment was about her.

 I also dislike how outside of England each league has users with two kinds of flair whether its Barca/Madrid, Bayern/Dortmund, Porto/Benfica or Juve/Milan, I hate how overhyped young players are and how every time someone links to a goal from a 15 year old every comment is either ""FOUND THE NEXT MESSI WENGER LOL"" or ""YOURE FUCKING DELUSIONAL IF YOU THINK THIS MEANS HE'LL MAKE IT AS AN ADULT'. Also the constant use of buzzwords that kill discussion: a few months ago if you told someone to ""take off the rose tinted sunglasses"" it was game over and now it's ""delusional"". Stop fucking trying to kill discussion by discrediting someone for disagreeing with you. I hate when Americans complain about being mistreated for being American on this sub, too, I mean it's bullshit but fucking get over it, you can't possibly expect a Chelsea supporter from London to not look at you in a different light if you're a Chelsea fan from Florida. I fucking hate how if you so much as acknowledge that you like a club other than the one on your crest everyone's like ""GLORYHUNTER AMIRITE????""

 I can't stand the ""unpopular opinion"" threads because they all just turn into ""I think Moyes deserves more time upvotes to the left"" and is just the reciprocal of the popular trends going around the sub. Schadenfreude is annoying as shit. The general lack of novel discussion really fucking kills potentially engaging threads. Also I hate that every time someone mentions ""USMNT"" the top comment reminds us of how shitty of an name it is. We all know. Nobody likes it but it's not going to change and you bitching and moaning about it on reddit definitely isn't.

 Fucking hate when people talk about players that they liked in FIFA or FM, and the best is when someone tries to talk to a supporter of say a League Two or Polish team and talk about how they brought that persons team to win the Champions League by 2018 in their career mode; if that doesn't trivialize a person supporting a lower level local team I really don't know what does. Also when people act pretentious about the team they support. Also I hated how everyone changed their crest to Tahiti during the CONFED Cup as a joke and now whenever someone that didn't change it back is spotted there's fifty comments about how great Tahiti played against Spain.

 I hate how any non-UEFA competition is looked down on for that matter. Also any comment about how someone would support a team or leage if they were better is like eye cancer, I mean your trying to qualify what's supposed to be unconditional support. Also the fans of teams that like Arsenal or Bayern because they're fun to use in FIFA. The fans that go on witch hunts for new fans are just as bad though, nobody gives a shit. So much shit that's annoying.

I fucking love you guys though and don't know what I'd do without you."

edit: please tell the idiots in /r/MURICA to stop brigading the sub and to learn what satire is as they seem to have forgotten and have missed the point of their own sub...

edit 2: ok, i will address your points if you insist. SAS is not 'dedicated to shitting on Americans' (in fact at Christmas we had a big, positive thread of people saying what they like about the US), it is just posting ignorant things that some Americans post over reddit and pointing out where we think they are wrong while having a laugh, admittedly at their expense. It can get more serious depending on the topic of the submitted post but is generally quite light-hearted. In a reddit where people seriously think there is an Anti-American circlejerk all over the site, it's nice to find people who don't agree with this. 

also, it has nothing to do with /r/shitredditsays. In fact, I've seen some on here express their dislike of SRS which I agree with due to them being a humourless bunch of insane, special snowlake mentals having a little circlejerk and brigading posts, but I digress.

Please feel free to make a /r/shiteuropeanssay or whatever, I'd read it. There are some European (and others) redditors who say some silly, misinformed things on reddit.

tl;dr: It's just a bit of fun. Take it or leave it. Please don't ruin this place like /r/MURICA did to /r/GunsAreCool. Stop downvoting me for my original comment now I've made a nice big one to read/disagree with"

If you're also paying for more than half the cost of ""keeping up the home,"" then yes.  This includes rent/mortgage, repairs, utilities, etc.

hollywoodbob,videos,1389839152.0,"&gt; 34% on a $4 item, not much. At that point adding $2 doubles the size of his business. Even the cost of processing the payments is up to 10%, there's also things to account for like taxes.

You're right $1.55, on a $4.50 product isn't much, but if you sell a hundred million units, that's a fucking mountain of money. 

&gt;With this investment he wants to take this to scale, they'll want to offer this to every farmer in America. To get to that point they need to make more. If you consider the cost benefit from this product it's absolutely worth it for farmers, it lasts for years (no recurring revenue) and saves you a lot of money.

Economies of scale my friend, the more he makes the cheaper the whole operation with be. 

&gt;He won't get as much as you think from this video because how many farming distributors watch Shark Tank on YouTube? Some but not thousands. As they said distributors, trade marketplaces or publications will take a cut. These channels will make it much more efficient to sell but cost.

Middlemen. They're going the way of the dodo. Customers can interact directly with the producer. He doesn't need distributors, he doesn't need shitbags who will convince him to make his product worse to make it cheaper, he doesn't need to advertise in magazines that no one reads. Displays at trade shows, displays in farm stores, and this video showing him shocked at the idea of gouging customers to make extra money, that's all he needs to reach everyone. He's really all this product needs to go global. I have a feeling the only reason he went on Shark Tank was to get the money to take time away from his day job to go to farm shows and sell directly to the farmers who could use this. And if you don't believe me, there are hundreds of artists, artisans, and inventors who make excellent livings whose only marketing tools are weekend trips to trade shows.

&gt; Since he designed the product and it's not generic he couldn't dropship. In the long run scale will allow them to make this cheaply but there are a lot of costs associated with running a big company, you have to order millions of units in advance and you can't do that unless you're getting decent cash in the bank.

He can easily dropship. If the factory that makes them can ship them to him they can ship to his customers. There's no reason for him to have to manufacture and store millions of units to keep his production costs low. All he'd have to do is collect a handful of orders, say 100,000 units, call in the order, have them manufactured, and then shipped from the factory to the customers. He could easily plan a manufacturing and shipping schedule that would keep his manufacturer, his customers, and himself and investors all happy without having to raise prices, or outlay unneeded expenditures.

She puts a lot of effort into harmonizing the outside world with her inner world, rather than harmonizing herself with respect to the world outside (Fe). Her focus is on the multitude of creative opportunities and expressions instead of a linear path of revelation (Ni), leading me to believe she's not an INFJ. 

Also, we see her reflect on her history and indulge in delicious nostalgia (Si), and use the knowledge she's collected to playfully engage the world in elaborate actions and schemes (Te). So, to me, she's an authentic INFP character.

I love when requests are taken on by multiple people as well, so just because someone has filled a request or performed a script, don't let that stop you from giving us another version.

I mostly look for public requests that spark my imagination. I will do private requests for friends, but if I don't know you, private requests come with a catch, so I don't get many requests Anymore, but that's ok because it keeps me from getting too overwhelmed and helps me to prioritize.

I know some people have said they won't do a request that doesn't turn them on, but that's not true for me. I love to stretch and I love a challenge, so as long as it's not pushing against something that is a hard limit for me, there's a possibility that I'll take a run at it.

I'm pretty picky when it comes to scripts because I know what does and doesn't feel natural for me to say, so it's difficult for me to read someone else's work, but I love to hear them performed by others.

The first step is to recognize that a system exists in which I as a white male get huge benefits from.

The worst thing that well intentioned white men can do is deny that this system exists. The second worst is claim that there's nothing we can do to fix it.

Surely this theory, if it holds any water, allows for that.

If so, the idea of God becomes  scientifically plausible. I'm thinking of a Pandeistic God here.

It's kind of strange. This theory seems to lend weight to the idea that a conscious being could have created our universe.

Thin down the handle, alot.  Use a file/rasp/scraper and get the handle to a comfortable size.  If you don't, your hand will tell you why you should at the end of the day.  I don't recommend sandpaper to finish the handle because it will clog the pores in the wood and it will be slippery.  Fit it to your hand, don't make it too thin, you know the drill.  Give it a definitive shape though, if it doesn't look acceptable, you won't like using it and it will affect your work, take your time.

You could use oil on your handle, I didn't because I didn't have any around, thinking about trying it though.  Both ways of treating the handle will eventually fit themselves to your hand and become more comfortable with use.

Verdatum was right about dressing the hammer.  Round off all the sharp edges and make sure the faces are polished and shiny.  Some like a sharp fuller, others like a wider fuller.  I'm thinking about widening mine, sometimes when I have to thin something out, the sharp fuller will put dents too deep into the metal and I'll have to start over."

Yes, if you have no idea what standard deviation is, and you try to use it anyhow, and for some reason you decide that it must be a measure of the average difference from the mean, and *not* a measure of variance, then you will have major problems.

Also!  Do not mistake median for mean, or diameter for circumference, feet for meters, or the market price of a bond for its face value, or day for night, or the harmless red milk snake to very similar looking but highly venomous coral snake.  Pro tip: If you have no idea what you're doing, you can make serious mistakes!

To the extent he has a point, I guess it's that its difficult to guess from the name alone that standard deviation is the square root of a distribution's variance.  Then again, you could say the same about the ""normal distribution"" (which isn't very normal), or the words ""mean"" and ""median"".  Statistics is not intuitive; that doesn't mean it has no value.

screenmagnet,sex,1389839479.0,"I can think of a few options for you to try:

1. Cock ring
2. Ask your psychiatrist for Viagra or Cialis.
3. If you know you will be having sex later that night, skip the concerta (because it lasts all day), and take the equivalent dose, but in short-acting Ritalin only. Short release Ritalin is out of your system in a few hours, so take your last dose no later than 4-5 hours before you plan to have sex. Obviously you should discuss this idea with your psychiatrist first, blah blah blah.
4. Alternatively, have sex first thing in the morning before you have taken your meds.


Also, check your blood pressure while you are on the ADHD meds, to make sure it isn't too high. And finally DO NOT MESS AROUND with your lamictal! You can not EVER skip doses or play around with the doses for that like you can with other meds.

Make sure you brush up on your Accounting and Economics, as both of those disciplines also have an impact on understanding Finance.

There is one warning, however. At the beginning of your Finance degree program (i.e. when you take your first Finance class), the department will ""set up"" a ""portfolio"" of $1,000,000 in fake cash for you to practice investing. You will compete with your cohort (students in your classes) for who will amass the greatest fortunes until you graduate. If your Graduation Portfolio is less than $1,250,000 by the time of graduation, the department won't grant you your degree. I'm dead serious. I've known a few friends who majored in Finance, couldn't get past the +$250,000 threshold, and ended up dropping out of the program. Many people think it's a bullshit requirement (and I tend to agree), but it sure as hell builds character in our program. Employers love to see that kind of shit.

Anyway, best of luck in your endeavors and don't let a single minute of your college experience go to waste!"

CapOnFoam,sex,1389839805.0,"&gt;I don't understand why she's not bothered by the fact that she likes things so mundane

This statement really bothered me. It seems insulting. 

You said that she said she likes your guys' sex life. You said that what she enjoys is mundane... and that you don't understand why she can't see that what she enjoys is mundane. If my partner said to me, ""I don't understand why you aren't bothered by liking such boring sex"" I would be pretty damn hurt. Just that you're *thinking* that probably comes off on your behavior.

&gt;I just don't get why she wouldn't want to try and work towards something that would knock her socks off... After a few days she'll notice that I'm not initiating anything so she'll propose sex.... and there's no spontaneity...

So, she enjoys having sex with you, she likes her sex life, and she initiates sex with you after a few days. (you say she has no libido?? I beg to differ.) Those are all really, really good signs honestly. I think you guys just need to learn different ways to communicate about sex, because your current approach isn't working. Go see a therapist. Or get some books, like Joy of Sex. 

Honestly, the way you're going about getting her to be creative is like asking someone ""so, what do you want to do for dinner tonight?"" or ""what do you want to watch on tv?""

Would dirty talk work? It can be awkward at first, but maybe it is a good first step at making some changes."

Are feminists immoral because they don't write books about subjects (that really, they don't have much experience with) like the remnants of the caste system/classism in india? They're trying to make a positive social change, where most people sit around not advocating for anything And so many of these groups are distant.  Like I would love to help aboriginals in Australia, but I'm half way across the world.  Those aren't issue pertinent to my area.

Feminism shouldn't stop being important just because there are mentally ill or poor people.  

And I think in general, feminism outside the western world is a much, much bigger issue. Female genital mutilation, forced marriage, ect are awful.

Once you've done that, if your band size is between 32-40 you shouldn't have much trouble on many conventional sites. Other great lingerie sources for smaller band sizes (and a wide range of cup sizes) include Nordstrom Rack, Figleaves.com, Amazon, 6pm.com, heck, even VS (or LaSenza) have a good selection of A-cups. You can also try bratabase, where users exchange new or lightly used bras that don't fit them. I have had a lot of luck and it is great for women who wear sizes not commonly available in stores."

GetOffMyLawn_,Fibromyalgia,1389840062.0,"&gt; I'm quite down at the realization that I'm probably not going to get much better than I am right now.

Well maybe and maybe not. I've had CFS for over 6 years and I continue to make incremental progress. There are a lot of things you can do to adjust to your new life and make your misery less even though you're not getting better physically. 

Prolly the biggest thing is acceptance. Trying to fight the disease uses up what little energy you have. Accept it and move forward from there. Of course that isn't easy as it sounds, you will experience grief for what you once were, that's normal. Go ahead and work your way through that. And anger and frustration and whatever other emotions come up. It is possible at some point to find a happy mental state. You may have to give up some things in life too. I had to quit work, and I loved my job and the people. I cried like a baby. After a few months of mourning it turned out to be the right decision.

Have you considered getting some counseling for you and your friend? It sucks that he's not supportive. Sounds like he's used to leaning on you and now he doesn't know how to stand on his own two feet and support you.

Do find a rheum and try some meds and see if they help any. There are quite a few options for pain and options for fatigue. 

Do try gentle exercise, it seems to help fibro people. You're not exercising to be fit in the conventional sense, you're doing it to help you feel better, not develop aerobic capacity or endurance or strength. So stretching and slow walking may not seem like much but they do make a difference.

Get some help. Can you get home health care? Can you get babysitters to help with the kids even when you're home? Can you get someone to come clean? High school or college kids would be cheap and you'll be home when they're there so no worries about them screwing anything up. Even if you get someone in once a week to do the heavy stuff like vacuum and scrub the bathroom that would make a huge difference.  What about grandparents? Do you have siblings? Can they come and spend some playtime a few hours a week? 

There's a lot more I could say but I don't want to leave a wall of text. There are lots of ways to cope and deal with this shit. Not saying it's easy but it's not impossible either. "

jaerick,MonsterHunter,1389840113.0,"If you haven't found [Kiranico](http://www.kiranico.com) yet, check out the weapon trees.

For dual swords, element is king - since you've got a high rate of attack, elemental damage will usually outdo the raw on your weapon. Zinogre line for thunder, Plesioth or Guild Sabers for water, Rathalos or Dire Miralis for fire, Barioth or awoken Typhoon for ice. Slime is also pretty beast on DS, so Spectral Demolishers are a pretty common choice. 

As far as using them to the fullest, combo less, reposition more. Check out some Heroics runs on Youtube -[ here's a favorite.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMLLL-JYnzE)

For hammers, focus on raw damage over element. It's not to say that you can't use elemental weapons, just that you'll get the most bang for your buck focusing on raw. Onslaught, Archambra Resurgence, Barroth lines, Narga lines, Nero's Chaos, Svarog Starsmasher... And of course, my beloved [Grongigas](http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qimwu/i_made_a_thing_psa_the_goddamn_grongigas/) (once you can get Sharpness +1).

In general, for hammers, you want to be engaging with the uppercut (one flash in the charge) or superpound (stationary full charge attack), in 90% of cases, aim for the face. The golfswing is the best move you can pull out for both KO and damage, so try to get it out as much as you can when you have an opening large enough for a full triple pound. You can link combos into the R charge after the second or third attacks in your triple pound, so use that to chain / reposition when needed.

Aaaand, I don't know shit about switch axes, I'm afraid. I hear people talk about Mizar's Asterism a lot, though - Power Phials seem to be the way to go.

whatswhat61,bestof,1389840116.0,"Gabe Newell is one of the most important figures in gaming history, up there with Shigeru Miyamoto, in my opinion.  He co-founded the company Valve and directly worked on the creation of Half-Life 1, which raised the standards PC gaming and the fps genre, then did it again with Half Life 2.  The CounterStrike series is one of the most important multiplayer games ever released, and basically invented E-Sports.  Portal 1 and 2, the Left For Dead series, pretty much every major valve release is an excellent title that makes serious innovations and cultural waves in the videogame community, and sometimes beyond it, like with Portal.

Beyond that, Valve as a company is extremely innovative structurally.  No titles, no assigned roles or positions, not even a real agenda.  Everyone works on whatever they'd like to work on and move their desks accordingly.  And from this chaos, an individual's passion becomes their guide, and great games are made.  They're also very open to their community of fans, releasing dev tools so mods can be created, being very open sourced, and genuinely listening to their passionate customers.

And finally, Steam.  Steam is to videogames what itunes is to music, except maybe even better.  Steam is your one-stop shop to buy PC games online, from tiny indie releases to massive AAA games.  Thanks to special package deals and insane steam sales, there're lots of opportunities to get games on the cheap.  And fair DRM policies and community features make purchasing games on steam a worthwhile alternative to just pirating them.

Basically, GabeN is a billionaire who gets it.  He cares about what his customers want, he cares about the quality of his products, about the welfare of his employees, and that's what has made him successful.  And we love him for it."

PurpleFrogSundance,IWantOut,1389840122.0,"I'm an Aussie with a sister living in NZ and I live in the UK.  I can't comment on Canada however…

I find Aus to be more expensive than London - for e.g. my phone contract costs me £25 in the UK and the equivalent in Aus would be AUD60.  My sister tells me that NZ is more expensive than Australia too ironically.  Well probably that its expensive with lower wages.

I think NZ is great but kind of like Aus - 10years.  In some ways thats awesome, its a little friendlier, little more chilled out, but I feel quite isolated when I get there.  However I'm usually staying in the small town my sister lives in which is very very rural…  Its harder to get jobs in NZ as the depth of market isn't their in most areas - although if you're considering structural engineering then you'll be set.  Lots of work after the earthquakes due to legislation changes.

Weather in NZ seems really variable - when I was there at christmas there was a full week of strong winds or torrential rain…  And midges.  I had so many freaking itchy bites!! lol  I prefer the spiders of Australia ;)

I think both countries have problems with alcohol (although I'd personally say that I find London to have the bigger drinking culture/drinking problem).  I've only ever been a victim of crime in Australia (so far) although I personally am not nervous being in any of these countries; just be sensible and aware and you should be fine.

So honestly, my preference is Aus over NZ but I prefer big cities.  I like Sydney as its slightly more accessible than NZ in terms of flights (i.e. Wellington adds another 3.5hrs to my flight from London… ouch!).  After listening to my sister speak about living in NZ, I know I wouldn't like living there more than a few months.

But you've asked a very wide question of people who know nothing of your personal tastes or current country or what you hope to study…  That might help give us some perspective"

CapOnFoam,TrueAtheism,1389840138.0,"It's not that easy when you're a publicly-held company that has an interest in protecting itself against lawsuits by former employees. You'd be amazed at what people will sue over. 

HR works very hard to protect a company against former employees who want to sue for wrongful termination, even if it's as crazy as ""my employer wouldn't let me read about stress relief online when I was stressed at work, causing me mental anguish."" Never mind that they browsed the internet for 6 hours a day. But you have to PROVE that you were warning them against internet use that much, put them on a performance plan, gave them opportunities to improve, prove that they failed at those opportunities, etc.

It is NOT easy. You can do it, but it requires diligence, documentation, and a lot of attention to detail. If you dont' document everything, HR will tell you so and prevent you from firing the employee until you provide sufficient documentation that would stand against a lawsuit or claim from the terminated employee."

Bama v LSU was played on the field and LSU won, so the head to head standings of the Top 3 are 1. LSU 1-0, 2. OSU 0-0, 3. Bama 0-1, and with OSU's generally considered better SOS, it makes sense to put OSU #2."

It is also EXTREMELY SLOW.

If you are intent on totally erasing your internal hard drive and installing fresh, I would suggest an alternative. Use a USB or FireWire or Thunderbolt hard drive. Use your Mac as it is now to install a basic Mavericks install onto the external drive.

Then boot from that drive, and use Disk Utility to format the Mac's internal drive, then install Mavericks there. Make sure to copy over the Mavericks installer you used in the first step or you'll have to download it again!


Nowadays things are more reliable and this hocus pocus of a ""fresh install"" is usually not necessary. But it will get you well practiced at booting from different media."

kdk12k2k12,AskWomen,1389840282.0,"Okay, I've watched her show on and off for years.  And I can strongly admit that I don't think she's funny.

The show's big pull is celebrity and you can only joke about Rihanna getting beat (this was never funny), or guzzling bottles of vodka or fucking black men for so long until it's so very tired.  

Yes, it's refreshing to hear *anyone* talk bluntly and openly, it doesn't have to be a woman but I feel like she'll get on a topic and ramble to a sort-of punch line, to which the audience will laugh at on command.

All that being said, I *do* commend her for what she's done for fellow comedians.  I read [this](http://www.amazon.com/We-Killed-Women-American-Comedy/dp/1250037786) great book and Lonnie Love points out something very critical to her career.  She notes that (paraphrasing) ""because of Chelsea, people know my name.  I would go on Jay Leno a few times a year and people might recognize me as that funny black chick on Leno.""

The way she rotates comedians on the roundtable is exposure much grander than, I feel, they've done for years on the road by themselves.  It's a tactic that is selfless and, IMO, the best part of the show.

You don't just have one head throwing boring zingers, you have four active minds going at it.

I will give credit to her holding her own on the late night circuit.  To break open on that front that's a male-dominated field is no easy feat.  She's mentioned that she wants to venture into areas other than fluff and if she does, I might watch it."

Englishrose_,changemyview,1389840303.0,"&gt;Except for the large number of third wave feminists who do hate men, right?

No.  I have literally never come across a 3rd wave feminist that hates men. And I have friends who are feminists, am apart of my uni's feminist organisation.  I am a feminist and I very much like man.  Heck my favourite person is a man.

Unless you have any real support that there is a significantly large number of 3rd wave feminists who hate men, then let me know.  But really, considering the literal definition of a feminist is someone who supports gender equality by advocating for women's rights, I think maybe misandrists is the word you're looking for? Supporters of matriarchy? Not feminist. Don't get those confused

ziztark,buildapc,1389840418.0,"Well (talking about the edit you made here):

he is a salesman trying to sell you his stuff. an ""entry-level"" gaming build is for sure not 1k, you can build a $500 entry level build. now, almsot everything he said is BS. i dont really have time to explain it here, but in general:

&gt;For just gaming, even on battlefield 4, that card can easily render multiple instances of it, but your Ram and proc will not be able to keep up with both instances.

That's total crap. the fx-6300 is a great processor, and won't be a bottleneck AT ALL. and the ram really makes little difference in gaming, as long as it's more than 1333 mhz and 4-6 gb.

The build he proposed is also extremely overpriced.

CPU: 20 dollars more than what it costs in newegg (usually)

RAM: 50 dollars more than a different (just as good) 8 gb corsair stick

GPU: 40-50 dollars overpriced, depending on model.

HDD: RIDICULOUSLY overpriced, you can find the seagate barracuda 1tb for 60 dollars (almost half) even in bestbuy.

CASE: he is trying to make money, you do not need a 700w PSU or a FULL SIZE TOWER, those are huge, you could do with a mini-atx or mid-tower case for 150 dollars less.

All in all i recommend either of these builds:

i have inquired about being trained to use it, because i feel like having someone in medsurg on night shift that could use it would be an asset, but was told that some resident somehow broke it last year resulting in $10,000 worth of damages so they don't train anyone on it anymore.

SOSBTK,pics,1389840518.0,I do not know why those kids both committed suicide and I cannot speak about whether or not they would appreciate this gesture or not but this is the most depressing thing ever to me.

It's like how people are more likely to commit suicide around the holidays; all of the Christmas cheer is what makes them depressed and putting a city holiday card in the mail will only serve as a reminder.

Either on our papers, friends' homework, etc. However, one day while I was in Spanish class sophomore year, this really weird, annoying kid was drawing vigorously. We were watching a video-book activity thing, so no one should have been writing. Our female teacher walks up behind him and gasps. He was drawing an extremely, high-quality penis. She grabbed his notebook and sent him to the office immediately. She started flipping through and found more. Think Jonah Hill in *Superbad*. It was terrible. I snuck into the teacher's room during lunch and took a peak at the notebook that was still sitting on her desk. I gotta give this kid credit, he had some artistic ability. However, this was a large, 5-Subject notebook. It was almost 3/4 of the way full. He had to have been drawing in it for years. 


Anyways, the next year, the kid didn't come back. Probably related to the penises.

I can't really go into a lot more detail than that, but he clearly knows how to continue his employment despite having been on multiple performance plans. I'm told his days are now numbered but I'll believe it when I see it.

At a different company, I used to manage a team and tried firing 2 people. It was a large company that, again, had a pretty strong HR dept and I ended up quitting before I was able to fire the two people I tried to. One person actually called HR and said I was discriminating against her for being a single mom, after she had called in for an entire week saying she couldn't find a babysitter. I told her that she needed to make arrangements and come in, because she didn't have any vacation or sick days left. So, she called HR and complained about me, saying that I discriminated against parents and wasn't following the company's family-friendly policies. And so, I had to go into HR and defend myself, even though this woman was already on a performance plan for lack of productivity.

Anyway... at-will isn't as simple as people think IF you work for a large organization that has a strong interest in protecting itself against its employees.

honestbleeps,chicago,1389840984.0,"&gt; I wish we could just leave it up to the owners of the establishments to make the call...

I don't like this argument.  It used to be up to owners of restaurants and bars whether people could smoke inside.  For fear of driving away smokers, virtually NO restaurant and NO bar was ever fully non-smoking.  Anyone who's been to a restaurant that's not huge in physical size knows that a ""non-smoking section"" is useless.

This meant that smoker or not, you were going to be (second hand) smoking if you went to a restaurant or bar.

This also meant that it was impossible to see a live concert (even if you were willing to see any band on earth and not just a band you knew / wanted to see) without the smoke.

Ultimately, businesses didn't want to alienate smokers even though that essentially meant alienating any non-smoker who knew any better about the health risks of second hand smoke (not to mention the horrible smell you come home with all over you, etc)...

I'm not a huge supporter of telling people what they can and can't do - but when they can't be bothered to consider those around them and it affects their health in a negative manner, I ended up being a supporter of the smoking ban.  I'm extremely glad it's in effect, and I shuffle way more money back into the economy as a result of it by going out when I often otherwise wouldn't have."

God that quote was from 10 years ago in a political rally trying pandering for the women's vote.  And honestly, I don't think you can really say who has it harder.  Once you're dead, you're dead.  There's nothing.  If you lose a husband and are forced to be a single mother, grieving for her dead partner, that's also pretty fucking shit.

nudity is not a crime, only nudity with the deliberate intention of causing distress and alarm to the public is

and then you add

congratulations you really are a complete and utter fucking moron

not in the same country they don't you dumb fuck, and Hertfordshire is in England where the law is as i stated the other being Scotland is for all intents and purposes similar enough to be the same.

[science tends to at least partially disagree with you](http://ntr.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/12/10/ntr.ntt203.short)...

[here's a bit more prose and info also](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/vapor-e-cigs-nicotine-toxins-tobacco-study-article-1.1565760)

specifically:

&gt; The researchers measured nicotine levels of 2.5 micrograms per cubic meter of air in the first study. Nicotine levels from e-cigarettes in the second study were slightly higher at about 3.3 micrograms per cubic meter. But tobacco cigarette smoking resulted in nicotine levels ten times higher at almost 32 micrograms per cubic meter.

&gt; ""What we found is that non-users of e-cigarettes might be exposed to nicotine but not to many toxicants when they are in close proximity to e-cigarette users,"" said Goniewicz.

&gt; ""It is currently very hard to predict what would be the health impact of such exposure,"" he added.

So basically ""e-cigs seem a lot less bad than the real thing, but there's still a nonzero amount of second hand toxins in the air, it's just a lot less, and we're not sure just how harmful that is""."

Although I tried Lord of the Rings online and after downloading 60GB in Steam it tried to download another 20,000 files once I launched it, and it did, then proceeded to try 22,000 forward patches. So to hell with that.

But Mac users used to get Portal 1 for free from downloading Steam and I think Portal 2 would run on almost any Mac that is still working. They're puzzle games that turn into crazy fps puzzle games.

Also Half Life 2 is sold for Mac and that's a great series of games. Should work on any modern mac no problem.

I suppose the gist is you'll find more games on Steam than the Mac App Store. The Mac App Store has more strict requirements and seems to end up with mostly ports of iPad games.

There is all of the BioShock games or Borderlands. You can get them on either Steam or Mac App Store. Not sure if there's a reason to prefer one over the other.

fortuna_spins_you,AskMen,1389841460.0,"Just because you want to have sex with someone and they don't want to have sex with you, doesn't mean EVERYONE wants to have sex with them.

Women are put in the position of waiting to be approached as well as having to be the one says ""no"". This is damaging for a multitude of reasons. If women do approach men, they are seen by many men as a ""whore"" or ""easy"" or ""desperate"". A lot of men say they would love if women approached them, but only the women they want to approach them not a random sample of women.  If you are in the passive role of waiting to be approached, you are just...waiting. Not every woman is constantly having guys fall over themselves to talk to them. If you aren't seen as attractive or desirable, you are just simply ignored and unnoticed (and this isn't a female issue, I'm sure a lot of men feel this way too). Then, if someone does approach you and starts to hit on you, you are expected to be the one who has to slow things down. This is bad for men and women. It puts pressure on a woman to make a decision she might not be comfortable with and the man is unwittingly putting pressure on her. Not to mention the fact that many non-look based qualities a woman posses (independence, intelligence, humor, career success) are seen as either negative/threatening or just aren't even attractive.

Like I was saying before, dating is tough from both sides. I don't think either side has it easy. They both face issues that are just very different from each other.

Frankly, if it's such a small percentage, either the 5% of waiting patients, or else the microscopic percentage of the national population of around 30 million, there really shouldn't be a problem with adding for-pay clinics for those who want to use their disposable income to improve their medical experience-- keep the money in Canada and tax it there. 5% of Canadians wouldn't sustain a whole like of dedicated practice-for-pay clinics.  

If it's the unfairness of it all that bothers you still, then you should of course ban your population from obtaining non-elective medical services outside the border. Enforce the fairness if you believe in it."

wufoo2,sex,1389841500.0,"With a foreskin, there's a trick you can use to overcome this problem.

My wife and I used it after she gave birth, when nursing causes vaginal secretions to run low.

1. Roll his foreskin closed.

2. While you holds your labia open, press the puckered foreskin between them.

3. Holding his foreskin sealed against her labia, pull his hips forward so his glans goes directly into your vagina.

4. With the foreskin still sealed, push his hips back so his glans retreats into his foreskin.

5. Repeat until your lubrication is distributed all over his glans and inner foreskin. You'll feel it when this happens.

Let go, and do what nature drives you to do.

citadel_lewis,philosophy,1389841787.0,"&gt;The problem of God isn't one of impossibility. The problem comes from a lack of evidence and a large dose of unlikeliness.

Of course it's not one of impossibility, but if this theory were true, it wouldn't be unlikely at all. If God is defined as the conscious creator of our universe, then all that is required for evidence that he existed, is that they prove systems with high values of phi are conscious. If the initial singularity had a high value of phi (I assume it would) then it must be conscious. 

Without getting into whether you or i think God exists or not, can you explain if the singularity from which the big bang emerged would have a high value for phi or not?"

Whether that was through ""boot camp"" style fitness, boxing, or lifting weights, it is a wonderful feeling to do something like go to the pet store, buy a 40 pound bag of pet food, then have someone ask, ""can I help you with that?"" as you sling it over your shoulder and say, ""no thanks, I got it!"" and strut off.

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1389841923.0,"I work in the book industry. He's not wrong. He's a dick about it, but he's not wrong.

Serious authors don't self-publish. You self-publish because you can't get anyone to read your manuscript. You self-publish because you've written Bigfoot porn. You self-publish because you're trying to write a book about how your healing powers can cure cancer, and no reputable publisher wants to be sued because of that bullshit. You self-publish because you're a control freak and can't stand someone editing your precious, precious words. You self-publish because you're convinced that the memoirs of your wholly mediocre life are interesting to anyone but you and your immediate circle of friends and family. You self-publish because you want to make a quick buck, and you don't really give a shit about quality.

You have your E.L. James and your Amanda Hocking and Lisa Genova and your Hugh Howey. But notice that most of them decided ""hey, being legitimately published is pretty cool"" when actual publishers flashed some cash, and gave Createspace and Amazon the finger as fast as they could sign their name on the dotted line.

Because having an agent, an editor, and a publishing house to market, edit, bind, distribute, and manage your publicity is pretty fucking cool. Doing all that yourself? Seems like it sucks. A lot.

And trust me, it shows. We know an author who published a book that was made into a movie. Can't get his manuscripts published legitimately now, and self-publishes. Better than 99% of the crap out there, but they still look and read amateurish. They need better editing, the binding and kerning and leading is off, and the paper weight is weird. The covers are unspeakably ugly. The marketing is nonexistent.

Yeah, so self-publishing is 99.99% crap. It's self-published for a reason."

stcamellia,explainlikeimfive,1389841924.0,"Progressivism, to me, is about continuing some basic societal decisions from the past 100 or 150 years.

Since the Civil War, views on States' Rights have been changing. It is generally accepted that states should not leave the Union. States are no longer allowed to infringe on their citizens based on race, etc.

Since FDR and the end of the Great Depression, the government's role in stabilizing the market has been largely accepted. People became very uneasy with letting the market ""ride out the storm"" so to speak.

50 years ago, large efforts were put into place to end poverty. So many social programs have since been inacted to maintain a basic quality of life for every American.

The rights of women, the mentally ill, minorities, the poor, unemployed, so on, so forth, have been repeatedly affirmed and most agree that the government and science have both grown to INCREASE the quality of life for EVERYONE. Progressives are pretty conservative, in that, they want to continue these trends. Gays, potsmokers, so on, so forth. Conservatives, on the other hand, want to ""conserve"" something that has long since passed."

China's police are actually quite professional and much better than the police forces in most any other developing nation. Even in 3rd or 4th tier cities they maintain a pretty good standard. The police won't ask you for a bribe; of course the barber shop / KTV / massage parlor owner will be paying the police leadership off for advanced knowledge or raids and protection. In any case they only target the very bottom rungs of prostitution as they don't want to risk picking up anyone with too much guanxi and have them rain trouble down. But if you're a regular person or legitimate business person, the police can be quite helpful. However Chengguan are nothing but dicks. The training of a mall cop, the role of a bylaw officer, a fraction of the pay of a police officer, part make work project, and abuse of power of a militia, they are underpaid and lack any real oversight. They target ""low-level crime"" so municipal bylaw infractions, street vendors, and harassing waidi ren. You can walk up to a police officer and ask for directions and they will be kind and civil and make sure you understand everything. Ask a Chengguan for directions? ""Don't you know Chengguan are too important to deal with you? Do I look like some lowly tour guide to you?"" Sometimes I feel sorry for Chengguan; I watch how my Chinese team members deal with them -- they just hate them.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1389842143.0,"&gt; but you want to close loopholes, which would mean that the marginal rates would become much closer to the effective rates. and then on top of that you want to significantly raise taxes. rubbish indeed.

Not rubbish at all. Although I can see why your small government mindset would be against it. Europe has tax rates like this tho.

&gt;i've done the back-of-the-napkin math. around $80K, you start paying a lot more in taxes. at about $120K, you are paying 25% more in taxes than with the current system. that is a massive tax hike. that doesn't seem right in my eyes at all.

In your eyes is the key word here. You seem to be for ""small government"". I look at it from the perspective that these guys make up the top 10% of the population. We also have an abnormally low tax rate in the first world.

&gt;care to provide those numbers? it is a FUCKING MASSIVE payout to millions and millions of people. we just do not have the money for it to make any sense.

http://jsfiddle.net/3bYTJ/11/

230 million people, 40% income and corporate tax rate, 2.6 trillion in other government spending.

&gt;yes, i know that. but the people already on those services get totally fucked while everyone else gets a little money. they would be taking home less money than they would in the first place. but whatever. sounds great. /s

Not really. Social security would be phased out, not instantly eliminated, so only people in the future would get less. And the way things are going, social security is gonna implode anyway...so....

&gt;please, show me the numbers where everyone gets this UBI while also showing that you wouldn't cut in half the tax revenue raised and where the money we are paying out comes from. i would love to see it. i have asked numerous others, and it has never worked out.

Um...what? 

Also, look, honestly, I can see why you wouldn't be for UBI. You're one of the few who wouldn't benefit from it. But trust me when I say it, the overwhelming majority of Americans WOULD. And to me, that's what matters, and that's why I'm for it."

littlestray,AskWomen,1389842186.0,"This is less advice on when and how and more of a ""this is what happened for me"".

I only began dating men when I was twenty-four (I'm twenty-eight now) and I've been very confident in my lack of desire to have children since I figured out that was something my body was capable of doing. This is important to the story--not justifying it to you guys. I already went through considering why I *would* want children and playing devil's advocate but still felt the same.

Every guy I dated, from casual to serious to long term to passer-by noting the field on my dating profile, every single one had his own two cents in the matter. And hey, that's fine, until they thought their two cents overruled mine. This included guys who didn't necessarily super-want kids but were put off at having to consider not successfully depositing their sperm at some point. It was a major cause for friction.

I don't think it's fair for someone who wants to be child free to feel pressured into considering having children to make their significant other happy, and I don't think it's fair for someone who wants children to hang that dream up for someone else.

It's a tremendous relief that my present boyfriend and I are on the same page about that, and both came into the relationship with that mindset. I heartily recommend it."

*Orville sees the strange woman fly, astounded by this ability. He sees the cane glow, and light come from it. A gunshot? He turns to the side to avoid it, but whatever this light is, it grazes his shoulder. The wound bleeds and burns at once, more painful than anything he's ever experienced, even Seuss's kick. But a smell rises to his nostril a fraction of a second later. It is something he has never smelled before, but as he feels the heat below his chin, he knows what it is. It is burning hair.*  
  
*Time slows down to a crawl for Orville, as he sees it happening. The strange light passed through his beard, slicing it somehow, half of it falling off. And the long tresses of facial hair begin their agonizing descent to the ground, Orville feels despair. It is true he only had such a beard because he never had the opportunity to shave, but he quite liked it all the same. He liked stroking it when he thought, enjoying the sensation of the hairs running through his fingers. In a bizarre way, that beard was his friend, a part of him that never caused any inconvenience, an aspect of himself he was truly proud of. Its length reminded him of his mother's long, raven hair, and unlike his own hair, which was behind his eyes, he could look down and see his beard. It hits the dirt in a moment, but in Orville's mind, the moment the hairs crash to the ground is the length of one thousand moments. He would happily trade one thousand moments from his life to not experience this one. But it has happened. And Orville looks at the girl who serves the mad doctor, and where she had been quicker than a bullet before, in that moment of a thousand moments, she does not seem to move at all.*  
  
*Orville feels the power of the earth in his legs, and makes a mighty leap for the weapon girl, taking flight with invisible wings of righteous fury.*  
  
""HOW DARE YOU!""  
  
*Orville latches to the flying girl, his added weight slowing her down somewhat, and causing her to swerve erratically in the air from the sudden 600 pound load she has picked up interfering with her flight calculations. While she tries to focus on fixing her flight path, he gets smacked hard several times with the cane that removed his proud facial hair, but he grabs it and wrenches it out of her hands, tossing it in the direction of the Marine sniper. He quickly grabs back onto her shoulder in rage, along for the ride where no slave has ever been: In the sky.*"

kiwirish,hockeyplayers,1389842269.0,"&gt;Typical cardio isn't gonna do all that much to help you from feeling gassed (though it's way better than nothing)

Not entirely true, cardio will increase one's anaerobic threshold, thus requiring a higher heart rate and more effort required to break into anaerobic exercise and meaning you can go harder for longer. Same reason 1500m runners still run 10-20+ km in trainings to get their 1500m time down, cardio is definitely a friend here.

&gt;Hockey is primarily an anaerobic sport, high intensity for short periods of time. Training in that manner with things like HIIT will help the most, as will simply playing more. 

However you're right here, after a great aerobic base has been built HIIT will be great for speed and holding the anaerobic fitness required, though I wouldn't recommend interval training to someone who gets gassed easily, rather that they do lots of UT1/2 training to increase the level required to get to AT.

&gt;Again, cardio isn't bad, but things like running are only going to help you in the recover your breath between shifts. Interval training, leg strengthening (either squats, other weightlifting and cycling) are what will really help you. 

High weight, low reps on the legs will be great for building muscle in the legs for speed and power, but low weight, high reps will be better to keep you going in the 3rd period.

Source: Have competed in sports where it is a constant battle between Aerobic and Anaerobic exercise, aerobic base cannot be stressed enough and only then does anaerobic work need to be done. You can get good AT level work done in 2-4 weeks if your cardio is up to scratch, but if it isn't, AT will do nothing to stop you feeling gasses early."

I can get how it's not the best idea to disclose internationally sensitive materials. But seriously -- what else should be done with the information? Nothing?

Disclosing that your nation is spying on its allies in a time of peace to an international audience isn't treason. At best, it's foolish.

Saying that I'm lazy and don't spend anytime with her. She says we never go anywhere, that I am always on the computer and she called me a kid. **I told her that I don't need her approval for my mom to watch my son.**

For whatever reason, she doesn't feel like she can talk to you about your relationship.  Maybe you get defensive when she brings it up.  Maybe you minimize her concerns.  Maybe you get made at her and invalidate her feelings.  Maybe the problem is her and she just misinterprets your reaction.

I can see it from your statement above.  For her, the fight wasn't even about your mom watching your son.  That may have been the straw (for whatever reason) that broke the camel's back, but for her, the fight was about you being lazy, not spending time with her, not going anywhere, you spending too much time on the computer and being a kid.  All those things that have been bugging her but that, for whatever reason, she feels like she can't bring up with you.  Then when the fight starts, all those things that she's been biting her tongue about come out.

That's why you think that she's happy and she tells you she's miserable.  Because **she's hiding her feelings from you.  That's where the root of your problem is** and that's what you need to work on if you want to salvage this."

The first line after the for is to randomize the contents of dblTableau, and the second one is the one you gave me.  But for some reason it's still returning like 10 decimal points for each value in the array.

I also tried:

vazzaroth,truegaming,1389842450.0,"Yea, MOBAs are by far the current worst offender of the ""Play right"", AKA Play the way I think is strongest, or don't play at all idea. I actually blame WoW for this. I mean, I blame WoW for most things, but I actual have evidence, I feel, for this one.


MMOs were always numbers games, as they were extensions of RPGs. But WoW made them mainstream. Mainstream, as opposed to the weird nerd RPG crowd (Which I proudly am in!), means there's people that ""Don't care about the numbers, I just want to play"". So they turned to their Nerd friends that played EQ or D&amp;D or w/e and just copied them. 

Since casuals and non-core-MMO fans eventually made up the majority of WoW's playbase, this mentality was accepted that you don't need your own build, you need the ""Optimal"" build as outlined by your raid leader. Which is another point! Raids are stupid. Blizzard balances them specifically so only the best, most optimal and usually un-fun builds can pass them without gear grinding or, later, even with gear grinding, because this mentality that everyone will look up their build online took over. So I can understand why the raid leaders make you follow cookiecutter builds, even though it's hardcore un-fun. It's Blizzard's fault in losing their grasp on the biggest game (probably) made so far.

So yea, everyone treats MOBAs like they're a Raid leader since there's no actual designated leader. And it's PvP, so if you assume the other side is ALSO like you and only playing optimally, it starts an arms race of douchbag personalities and the people that troll them. All the normal, well adjusted people are caught in the crossfire."

dog_in_the_vent,MapPorn,1389842534.0,"Not sure what to think about this map.  Firstly it's torture *allegations*, which as we all know are not conclusive proof that torture took place.  While it could very well mean that torture took place, it could also mean that more people are willing to lie about torture taking place in that country.

Second, countries like Iraq where torture was known to have occurred regularly under the Hussein government have peculiarly low numbers.  You're telling me that between 1995 and when Saddam was ousted in 2003 there were, at most, only 111 allegations of torture?  It's fairly widely documented that Saddam used fear and torture to control his people.  This graph does not represent that.  To be fair, it could be said that Iraqi victims were afraid to come forward for fear of reprisals.

Third, the deepest red category also covers the largest number of incidences by a wide margin.  1-53, 53-111, 111-195, 195-359, 359-**1034**?  The author easily could divide the latter category into smaller categories to give a better picture of what they're trying to portray.

That is, unless they're just trying to portray America in a bad light by artificially changing the categories and giving it the deepest shade of red.

Don't get me wrong, torture is reprehensible and America has been accused of torture repeatedly in the past, but I feel like this graph is misrepresenting the truth."

I guess it depends on what you first see in the sub and some comments do seem a bit exasperated with people's logic and whatever in the linked posts. IDK, maybe we could change on here and be a bit less hostile. I guess it's up to everyone else on the sub.

While the patriotism is understandable (even Europeans get patriotic when we think no one's looking lol), I think it can be blinding for some on reddit and IRL. OK, your gov't is different from the people but sometimes you need to remove emotion and whatnot from the situation and objectively look at things e.g. gun control and it seems some people (americans and otherwise) are unable to do this.

As you may have guessed, I am from the UK. If you're coming here, try the wikis on /r/unitedkingdom and /r/lonsn and sort by controversial (the same questions get asked a lot) on /r/askuk to see people's suggestions on stuff to do. I hope you enjoy your time over here regardless, there's so much to see and do and tons of history and whatnot. I'd personally encourage you (if you do go to the UK) to venture beyond London.

My first hammer was a Craftsman 2.5lb that I got as a gift (and I still use).  I was dressing that thing for a solid three hours, can't say I'm surprised with Craftsman though.  It works great after I worked on it though, I probably have around 500 hours of use with it."

- sometimes it is hard to tell when you are having an orgasm when you first start having them (for girls).
- it is okay for all genders to play with their bum, and if a guy does it, it doesn't mean he is gay. Also, only put things with a flared base up the bum.
- some girls may ejaculate, and this is perfectly normal and okay
- girls should pee after masturbation to avoid UTIs
- you do not have to be 18 to go to a sex shop or buy sex toys
- if a girl inserts toys in her vagina, this doesn't mean that she isn't a virgin anymore
- masturbation is a basic human right, and so is privacy

EasyBriesyCheesy,AskWomen,1389842902.0,"I was originally put on the pill (generic Cyclessa = Velivet) to help fix issues with my cycle.  I was super irregular, bled so much that it affected my health, and had debilitating cramps.

It absolutely cleared up all of that, and my period is never more than a day late.  I'm not sure what hormone issues I've had, if any, as they were probably overshadowed by everything else.  I'm three years in (I'm 22 now) on the pill, and I'd say that I've more recently become a bit more emotional around certain times, but it's nothing major.  My libido has actually *increased.*

Other side affects I had within the first 3 months were a decreased appetite (which led to some weight loss, but nothing major), I suddenly needed a couple hours more sleep at night (I used to be fine on 5-7, now need at least 8), and my boobs grew in size just enough to need to buy all new bras.

If you're careful about taking the pill, there are fewer worries about condoms (no freak-out if it breaks).  Which is awesome when I'm with someone exclusively, as I also have a latex allergy and latex-free condoms suck."

Lower genetic diversity is never a good thing, and we've already passed through so many genetic bottlenecks as a species that any further loss of genetic diversity done purposefully would be completely idiotic.

Because nature doesn't always value what humans value. And unintended consequences (higher disease prevalence rates for a disease that doesn't yet exist, for example) are really difficult - if not impossible - to undo when you have caused entire alleles (different forms of the same gene) to literally go extinct."

Life-in-Death,vegan,1389842976.0,"I have a page long compilation of health studies that I prepared for a post, they included vegan &gt; vegetarian.

My 98% number is through talking with a director of Friends of Animals and Gene Baur at Farm Sanctuary.  

If you think about it: 
Animals in: 
Entertainment (some *may* be considered abuse): i.e. Circus,
Research: Medical, cosmetic
Clothes/Acessories: Feathers, crocidile skin, fur.
Illegal: Dog Fighting

Other use of animals:
Occupation: Police Dog
Labor: Carriage horses
Pets: Breeding

We by far consume way more animals by food.  Let me randomly google:

Some numbers:
&gt;(nearly 10.2 billion) land animals were raised and killed for food in the United States in 2010
Aquatics outnumber land by like 7 to 1.  So that is about 80 billion animals a year in food.

For 2009: 
&gt;2009 amount to 8.3 billion land animals and 51 billion sea animals. (So, a total of about 59 billion animals.) 
This is in the US

Worldwide:
&gt; 58 billion are killed worldwide. (this is only land animals, so we can perhaps apply the 7x to add aquatic?)

Though another site has 150 billion world wide.  This seems low if 58 billion of them are land animals.  The site that states 150 billion also says:

&gt;According to these statistics, about 53 billion land animals are slaughtered annually worldwide. (It should be noted that at the time the numbers were compiled, they were the minimum numbers of animals killed each year. The actual numbers may be significantly greater insofar as some countries or territories either did not report, or deliberately excluded, some statistics

&gt;It's important to note that, since most of the available data are now eight years old as of 2011, these estimates are extremely conservative. It is now quite likely that in many of the categories noted, the current kill rates are as much as 10 percent higher than what is indicated here

http://www.adaptt.org/killcounter.html

But then for fish, there is also:
One organization has tried to create an accurate calculation for fish, and has estimated that about **1 trillion fish** are caught each year

http://humaneeducation.org/blog/2011/06/29/food-for-thought-infographic-on-number-of-animals-killed-for-food-worldwide/



Vivisections:
Estimates range from 17 million to 70 million to 100 million.  

This does not mention if it is worldwide or US

Every year, over 40 million animals are killed for fur worldwide. 

http://animalrights.about.com/od/animalrights101/tp/How-Many-Animals-Are-Killed.htm

So food we have 100's of billions to trillions.
For others,  100s of millions


And this is from our friends at ALF
&gt;**Animals used for food production account for 97% of all animals killed** in US slaughterhouses, labs, pounds, and open spaces. Although they are capable of experiencing most feelings that we and our beloved companion animals do, farmed animals are view and treated by the meat, dairy, and egg industries as mere tools of production.

clankypants,Minecraft,1389843192.0,"I just gave it a go on my machine. It's only 5x5 (because that's what I thought the spread of bonemeal was when I built it, not realizing it's actually 7x7, but that shouldn't matter too much since the density drops off near the edge), and it's in the plains biome (my superflat test world), so no orchids.

I ran it for 1 minute and got:

* 69 Oxeye Daisies
* 57 Azure Bluets
* 97 Dandelions
* 53 Poppies
* 207 Seeds

(total of 276)

I ran the test a second time and got:

* 46 Oxeye Daisies
* 57 Azure Bluets
* 77 Dandelions
* 59 Poppies
* 247 Seeds

(total of 239 flowers)

And a 3rd time gave me:

* 59 Oxeye Daisies
* 61 Azure Bluets
* 97 Dandelions
* 57 Poppies
* 251 Seeds

(total of 274 flowers)

The tests averaged 263 flowers per minute, which would come out to be 15,780 flowers per hour. So comparable to yours. Though I don't know how Blue Orchids' growth chance compares to the other flowers.

Also, 136 bonemeal is used in that minute of operation, or 8,160 bonemeal per hour."

My problem is with the word programmed. It implies that it is impossible to be any other way. Yes, on average men and women have different brain structures, which makes some people better or worse at certain kinds of things, but the red pill, as far as I can tell, extrapolates this to say that there are many things that women are irreparably bad at. A machine is programmed, and cannot deviate from that programming. A person is not, from birth (the articles they posted all said that the brain differences developed during adolescence), immutably programmed differently than another based on gender alone, within the context of the topic of the thread. Saying otherwise is, in my outside opinion, along the red pill platform."

sunofabeeeyetch,AskReddit,1389843243.0,"It doesn't matter if Ms. Y gave explicit permission if she was drunk. The reasoning goes that, since she's intoxicated, she is unable to legally give consent as her state of mind is inadequate at this moment in time; it's the same reasoning that determines the age of consent. Just because someone is willing at a certain moment does not mean they are legally able to give permission to do so. It would be on the defense to prove that Ms. Y was so high-functioning at the time that no reasonable person would be able to discern that she had ingested mind-altering substances in a relatively recent time frame; given that both Mr. X and Ms. Y were at an event where alcohol was consumed, no reasonable person would be unable to discern that there was at least a heightened chance that Y had consumed alcohol relatively recently.

The line is drawn when one person has a higher rational capacity than the other; frequently, the distinction is made when one person believes that they were taken advantage of by the other in that the former was incapacitated in their ability to refuse (i.e. intoxication) and the other was not. I'm not sure how it would go in the event that both parties were intoxicated to the point of impairment, but in my opinion the reasoning of agency imbalance wouldn't/shouldn't stand if both involved are so impaired as to be unable to directly be responsible for the exploitation of the other.

wraith313,personalfinance,1389843306.0,"My only response is that: I doubt anybody will pay 3x the value of a volatile commodity like this as they would with a standard investment/asset purchase. I say this based on all the posts in here talking about how unlikely it is that it will keep producing at this rate etc. I think the time to sell at a huge top dollar rate is already over, most likely.

Also: half of your responses are, again, assuming he doesn't invest *any of the money*. ""Someone tied up completely in one investment"" , he isn't ""tied up"" in anything. He has this, he has the proceeds from it. He can invest the proceeds. Since he has 120k that is NOT tied up in this oil field, he isn't completely tied up in it. I do see your point, I really do, but since he has no money in tied up in this all he is risking is opportunity. The opportunity to (maybe) sell. But I don't think we should treat opportunity necessarily the same way we would if he had a bunch of his funds at risk. All he has at risk right now is *potential future funds*. Which is a big deal, but even still, it's just potential. I do see your point though.

You are assuming, I believe, that I am saying not to diversify. Not the case. But I think you are being extremely optimistic about how much money he will be able to get for this property. If someone is willing to pay 300k for his stake in this, then he should keep it for himself, IMO. Because that means its likely itll keep producing. And a better than average chance of it still producing is really the only way I see somebody buying it anyway.

Thats my two cents. OP doesn't know enough about this, obviously, to be able to make this decision alone. In fact, idk why he is even asking us. He should hire a lawyer well versed in this stuff and a financial adviser and ask them what to do. It's short sighted to trust the Internet with decisions like this. I don't think anyone would argue that point. IMO anytime you go over 100k and have questions about what to do, the answer should always be ""make an emergency fund and go see a financial adviser""."

Hopefully I'll learn my lesson this time and not jump right into another serious relationship right away. I've been able to enjoy some time as an autonomous adult with minimal responsibilities over the past couple of months, and it's kind of nice. I got a few months of that during my last separation, but I was in a hurry to fill the loneliness with another person, and there were a few candidates who were quite willing. Responsible single dads are apparently a hot commodity, which makes it far too easy to jump to the next relationship before you're over the last one. It eases the pain in the short term (they do say the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else), but the help it provides makes it easy to ignore all of the red flags."
Dinaroozie,FeMRADebates,1389843544.0,"&gt;Almost every single feminist I've talked to (except, like, the 12yr olds) know that women are also responsible for perpetuating patriarchal beliefs and practices, and that socioeconomic power isn't the only way to measure the issues faced by a given gender.

I'm sure that's true, but in the defense of MRAs getting the wrong end of the stick on this, I think people are far less inclined to admit to such nuances when they're talking to 'the enemy'. There's a certain impulse to avoid giving the other side any ground - so, for instance, your feminist friends might be entirely willing to discuss *with you* the fact that there are contexts besides socioeconomic power when discussing gender politics. Perhaps they are less likely to talk about that when debating MRAs on the internet? In other words, I suspect that as a feminist, you get exposed to a much more nuanced view of what other feminists think. People who identify openly as MRAs probably get about the least nuanced view of such things possible. That might go some way to explain why to people from the outside, it looks like feminists generally don't think the way you're describing.

I'm not trying to suggest that the feminists you know are like this, mind, or that feminists in general are more like this than any other groups. Just that it seems to be one of the things humans do, and might explain some of the discrepancy between how people from within a group and from outside it perceive what the group believes."

TheCryptic,wicked_edge,1389843572.0,"&gt;-I know that mileage and blade experience varies, and that I don't want to learn using sharper, thinner, blades such as feather, but for mildly sensitive skin and a tough beard, what blades have typically worked best for you guys on the 22r?

I personally don't own a 22R, but I don't think that will change the answer much...  Everyone's skin and hair is different and you could easily get three different answers from three different people with that razor, sensitive skin, and a tough beard... And none of them may work for you.  Actually there are days that I think that everybody has sensitive skin and tough beards and nobody is ""normal"".  It really is something to figure out on your own.  I recommend trying each blade a couple times until you find one that works pretty well.  Then stick with that blade for a month to really get a feel for technique.  Then maybe go back and try seeing if you can find your perfect blade.

&gt;-I am still in need of a good aftershave. I've heard places like the supermarket have a good selection of nonalcoholic aftershaves, is this true? If so, users of prorasso green, is there a particular aftershave you use that compliments the eukalyptis in the shave cream? 

I believe Walmart carries the Nivea for Men aftershave products, and they're pretty popular and non-caustic.

Personally I get my aftershaves on Amazon and really like a couple of the Clubman products, but they are alcohol based.  They tend to be affordable and classically clean in scent.  My personal favorite for scent and performance is the Clubman Pinaud Special Reserve, but my wife hates the smell.  She likes the Classic Vanilla, and it performs well enough.  Avoid their Bay Rum, it is somewhere between habanero oil and molten steel in the heat it provides.

As far as complimenting the eucalyptus, I like Clubman's Jeris Osage Rub...  It's alcohol based and strong on menthol.  If you try it make sure to use it sparingly, it's intense.  Don't worry about trying to match the Proraso's scent, shaving cream/soap doesn't leave any behind longer than a few minutes."

lamblikeawolf,short,1389843627.0,"The problem with these things is that everyone (general population; not geneticists) thinks even polygenic traits (traits that are determined by many different genes in many different places on the genome) are additive. When really, it is much more along the lines that the trait is greater than or less than the sum of it's parts because of the currently unknown ways that genes interact. While scientists are currently working towards understanding these things, without living examples, it is nearly impossible to predict how or if a particular gene will interact with another, completely unrelated gene that deals with another unrelated trait. And you also have [alternative splicing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_splicing) which results in one piece of DNA being able to be interpreted in multiple ways.

On top of this, [scientists recently discovered that some genes have more than one meaning within the genetic code](http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/12/12/scientists-discover-double-meaning-in-genetic-code/) which makes it even more difficult to say with any kind of certainty. (This is different from alternative splicing. Alternative splicing happens on the level of mRNA, which is a ""copy"" of the gene that allows it to be manufactured into a protein. The ""double meaning"" appears to function on the level of the DNA itself.)

TL;DR - people are retarded when it comes to selecting for specific traits because of all of the billions of ways genes can interact with each other that we haven't yet completely catalogued 100%, and will probably never be able to do."

Dave didn't find his niché, make a website, and then wait.  Instead he made what he wanted, showed it off, and let the product sell itself.

The same is true with your luxury product.  It's the kind of thing that sells itself once people know about it, but not necessarily the fodder for your standard social campaign.

There are a few choices if you want to do something other than meet every cigar shop in a 500 mile radius (which you should do if you haven't already).  The first choice is to blog and blog and blog some more.  Show you're an expert and then guest blog on sites that serve your demographic (generally M 50+ if I were a betting man).

Second to that, find yourself a good photographer and a good graphic designer and get some web sized ads done.  Go find these blogs and websites that serve your demographic and put display advertising there through the Google Display network.  Make sure to hand pick your placements so that you're as targeted as possible.

Lastly, and know the gravity of this statement as its coming from a purely digital marketer, find some print publications that serve your audience.  Your demo (at least the one I'm guessing at) is notoriously hard to reach, but they also are the type who will still pick up niché publications.  Find something that is reputable and has a monthly or quarterly distribution and place an ad there.  Don't go smaller than 1/4 page otherwise you're wasting your money.

And as another commenter said, go to trade shows.  These things need to be seen in person and it's well worth your time and money to run that circuit."

Drakkanrider,sex,1389843684.0,"&gt; My wife and I have a great relationship and have discussed swinging
&gt;  My problem here is not that she wants to do it (I actually like the idea of her having sex with another guy), the problem is I feel betrayed in this exchange.

OP is open to his wife sleeping with someone else, so your idea that she shouldn't sleep with someone else doesn't fit OP's situation.  He wants her to, he just thinks that *this specific situation* is bad and is making him uncomfortable.  When you want to have an open relationship (hell, when you want to have a good relationship) you need to communicate about things instead of setting ultimatums left and right.  But if you don't understand why you need to talk to your partner and explain your feelings instead of telling them what to do, then I really don't think this discussion needs to be continued.  We just have fundamental differences in what we think a relationship is.  And, according to another of your posts, what we think a strong man is."

Personally, I detest dress-up parties, especially ones like a previous employers christmas party, where if you didn't dress to the theme, they'd have a suitably embarrassing outfit on hand to force you into.

Triplanetary,DaystromInstitute,1389843785.0,"Yes, this is an important point. The easiest way to detect a ship in space is likely to be heat. Even ignoring the heat produced by things like engines, computers, etc., just making the ship habitable for humanoids means that its atmosphere is about 270 degrees centigrade hotter than the background temperature of space.

All that heat has to be radiated out, or it'll build up inside the ship and cook you to death. This thermal radiation would stand out very strongly in space. This is something you're going to have to hide if you want to be invisible.

But this brings up the question of what exactly a cloaking device *does*. The show relies on visual cues to communicate to the audience that the ship is rendered invisible, fine. But surely it doesn't solely render the ship invisible to visible light. For the reason above, and many others, that would be useless.

Presumably a cloaking device masks *all* of a ship's thermal and EM emissions, and it's possible that any device that masks any or all of those things is defined as a ""cloaking device,"" and thus the Federation may be prevented from developing any kind of effective stealth technology at all."

Oooh, something I didn't think of, but now that I read it, I can totally see it.  She likes to broadcast on her blog?  Normally, I'd say that's not necessarily a bad thing to be open, but combine that with the you-don't-need-condoms thing, and that gives me the strong impression that this woman may indeed be careless with others' health and feelings.

&gt; And you should also advise your friend to avoid putting his dick in crazy as well.

He probably wouldn't listen; crazy can look very attractive.  Many people don't see it until it's too late."

As to your question, realize that there is no ""Blue Pill"" way of doing things, that phrase is either used by us as a satirical jab or by red pillers in the same way conspiracy theorists use ""sheeple"". If you are happy with your partner then for crying out loud who else do you need to prove yourself to?

There is one little piece of advice I'd like to impart if you don't mind. Your rhetoric belies young love, and perhaps a bit of pedestalization on both your parts. Please remember that your partner *isn't* actually perfect, he's a person with flaws and there may be bumps in the road in your relationship. Don't allow these patchy moments to cause you disappointment in him for not being perfect, there will be moments you need to work through together.

Sicrux,buildapcsales,1389843989.0,"Posting this to dissuade people from bugging Amazon CS for expensive Razer devices... 

Spent an hour talking to CS for a BlackWidow Ultimate, it didn't go well...

&gt; Initial Question: Looking for a price match on a product.
&gt; 
&gt; 02:35 AM(GMT) Ezhilarasan(CSA): Hello Sicrux, my name is Ezhilarasan. I'll be glad to assist you today. 
&gt; 

&gt; 02:35 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Hi there
&gt; I was looking to have an item price matched.

&gt; 02:36 AM(GMT) Sicrux: The item is the Razer BlackWidow Ultimate Mechanical PC Gaming Keyboard

&gt; 02:37 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Hello?

&gt; 02:37 AM(GMT) Ezhilarasan(CSA): Yes.
&gt; I'm checking.

&gt; 02:38 AM(GMT) Ezhilarasan(CSA): May I have the order number, please? 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 02:39 AM(GMT) Sicrux: I do not have a current order number for the item, unfortunately.
&gt; 02:40 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Hello...?

&gt; 02:40 AM(GMT) Ezhilarasan(CSA): I'm sorry.
&gt; With the exception of TVs and cell phones with service, Amazon doesn't offer a price match guarantee. We do consistently work toward maintaining competitive prices on everything we carry. 
&gt; Because the marketplace is constantly changing and we strive to offer the lowest price, you'll see some fluctuations in our prices over time.

&gt; 02:41 AM(GMT) Ezhilarasan(CSA): However, you can let us know about a lower price by clicking the ""tell us about a lower price"" link in the Product Details section of any product page.

&gt; 02:41 AM(GMT) Sicrux: I was told that Amazon was honoring this match-up however...
&gt; http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/1v9a63/all_razer_gaming_peripherals_50_off_all_razer/ceq14ps

&gt; 02:42 AM(GMT) Sicrux: The manufacturer is having a 50% sale going on today...
&gt; and I would rather spend my money at Amazon than there.
&gt; https://offers.visit.io/promo/t/c_1de28139d0ad19c5bf8b7ce30d2b697e29c92edc?1389803221#

&gt; 02:43 AM(GMT) Ezhilarasan(CSA): Please provide me the link of the item.

&gt; 02:43 AM(GMT) Sicrux: http://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Ultimate-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B008U5ZNIG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389839737&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=blackwidow+stealth+ultimate

&gt; 02:43 AM(GMT) Ezhilarasan(CSA): Thanks.
&gt; 02:45 AM(GMT) Ezhilarasan(CSA): In this case, Let me connect you to a member of our Generalist team. It will only take a moment.

&gt; 02:45 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Okay
&gt; 02:46 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Hello

&gt; 02:47 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): Hello Sicrux. Good Evening. My name is Johanna C. Nice meeting you. I'll be happy to be of service to you today. 

&gt; 02:47 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Nice to meet you!

&gt; 02:47 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): The pleasure is mine.

&gt; 02:48 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Did the other representative happen to fill you in?

&gt; 02:48 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): Yes.
&gt; 02:49 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): You are looking for a price match for the item Razer BlackWidow Ultimate Mechanical PC Gaming Keyboard, right?

&gt; 02:49 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Yes Ma'am

&gt; 02:50 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): Did you saw the same product from other website with a lesser amount?

&gt; 02:50 AM(GMT) Sicrux: It's currently on sale at 50%
&gt; But yes.
&gt; They're running a Best of CES Sale 
&gt; https://offers.visit.io/promo/t/c_1de28139d0ad19c5bf8b7ce30d2b697e29c92edc?1389803221#

&gt; 02:51 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): Let me check.

&gt; 02:51 AM(GMT) Sicrux: and I was hoping that you all might be able to price match... Would definitely make me a lot happier than ordering from them...

&gt; 02:51 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): Let me check it first. One moment please.
&gt; 02:52 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): You can check out these choices: http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=Razer%20BlackWidow%20Ultimate%20Mechanical%20PC%20Gaming%20Keyboard\

&gt; 02:53 AM(GMT) Sicrux: It's the top most one.
&gt; 02:56 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Hello?

&gt; 02:56 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): I am still here.
&gt; I looking for an option on this. I will try but I will not make any promises.

&gt; 02:57 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Can I offer a suggestion?

&gt; 02:58 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): Yes.

&gt; 02:58 AM(GMT) Sicrux: I could order the product, and get the price changed or partly refunded? would anything like that work?

&gt; 03:00 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): That should work if the discount or there is a promotion on going for that certain item.

&gt; 03:00 AM(GMT) Sicrux: There is.

&gt; 03:00 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): We consistently offer competitive prices on everything we carry; however, the prices on our website are subject to change. While the Amazon.com website has accurate pricing information, we don't honor prices or savings posted without our permission on other websites.

&gt; 03:01 AM(GMT) Sicrux: This is an official statement from Razer... https://offers.visit.io/promo/t/c_1de28139d0ad19c5bf8b7ce30d2b697e29c92edc?1389803221# stating that they're doing a 50% off sale for all peripherals and 10% razer systems
&gt; This keyboard in question is one of the stated peripherals.

&gt; 03:03 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): I understand but the promotion is from other website not from Amazon.com.

&gt; 03:04 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Is there any way we can possibly make this work? I really would love to give Amazon my money in exchange for the product.

&gt; 03:07 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): I'm afraid there isn't any way because the prices we had is fixed and we cannot just grant any price match especially if it is from another web site.

&gt; 03:07 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Even though it's the Manufacturer's site?

&gt; 03:09 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): Right. Because they have their own promotion and pricing on their product.

&gt; 03:09 AM(GMT) Sicrux: and no stock.

&gt; 03:10 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): There's stock of it.

&gt; 03:10 AM(GMT) Sicrux: http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-blackwidow-ultimate
&gt; 03:11 AM(GMT) Sicrux: There's no stock for 3-4 weeks (according to the site)
&gt; as far as I've been aware, they've had no stock for the majority of their sale...
&gt; if not the entirety of it.

&gt; 03:11 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): That is for their website, we don't have any information about it.

&gt; 03:13 AM(GMT) Sicrux: information such as what?

&gt; 03:15 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): If they have stock from them or not. Because from Amazon, we have stocks from our fulfillment center because we bought many stocks in advance for future orders.

&gt; 03:17 AM(GMT) Sicrux: And even though you have stock, and are aware of this sale they're doing... with no visible announcement of availability in the near future, Amazon cannot match the price of a competitor? The Seller would be Amazon directly, there are no third-parties involved.
&gt; I apologize for being so picky about this.

&gt; 03:20 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): I do understand your side Russell. The item from our website is from Amazon.com only however the promotion on going is from another website. We can only grant price match if there is an ongoing promotion from Amazon.com

&gt; 03:22 AM(GMT) Sicrux: And Amazon doesn't desire to match with it's own promotion? Just looking toward Amazon's benefit at making some money...

&gt; 03:23 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): We don't have any promotion for Razer Keyboard for the moment.

&gt; 03:24 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Why have other peripherals been matched?
&gt; same sale and such, I can provide an order number.

&gt; 03:25 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): i understand that you can provide an order number for same sale however that was before or an old sale from 
&gt; 03:26 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): Amazon, it is not a recent sale from Amazon

&gt; 03:26 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Order Number: 002-7250141-6415454
&gt; That's an older purchase?

&gt; 03:30 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): That is a another kind of promotion. 50% is to big compare to the price that this keyboard have now. Again, I am very sorry if I cannot match the price because it does not have any approval from the upper department or from Marketing.

&gt; 03:32 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Quite understandable.
&gt; I appreciate you time, and I'm sorry if I've caused any stress.

&gt; 03:34 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): thank you for understanding. No, you did not cause any stress.
&gt; Is there anything else that I can help you aside from this? 

&gt; 03:35 AM(GMT) Sicrux: I believe that is it... I do have one minor question though, do you happen to know if Amazon will be having any sales on Razer peripherals in the near future?

&gt; 03:35 AM(GMT) Johanna(CSA): Not any time soon.

&gt; 03:36 AM(GMT) Sicrux: Alrighty, again, thank you very much for your time. Have a great night/day.

As for how to stop people from breeding unlicensed?

Edit: I should probably add that I'd be happy to give a first offender the chance to pass the test prior to the birth of the child before mandatory rehoming would occur, and that I'd not discriminate on the basis of gender or orientation of the parents seeking the license, so long as they acknowledge that the state is not liable for, nor accountable for procuring said child, nor the means by which they could obtain one."

livetolearnandlove,ForeverAlone,1389844337.0,"I would say love is like a fine wine. It generally gets better with time. If you don't take proper care of your wine then it can turn to vinegar. It's not as though vinegar is useless. Just as relationships that don't work out are not useless because you learn from them. The trained pallet may be more discerning of love and fine wine. The first time you fall in love, have that first taste of wine, you enjoy the heady feeling and get drunk on it. Over time you begin to choose wine based on taste and will steer clear of the ones that leave you with headaches. Some loves are light and pair easily and others bold and work only with a few. 

I could go on but I feel silly now, and a little sad."

AFormidableContender,PurplePillDebate,1389844669.0,"&gt;This is weird. TBP's favourite dating advice giver is Dr. Nerdlove and from what I've read of him, his advice is definitely not the ""just be confident"" ""just be yourself"" type. He's made fun of this trope several times in fact.

I'm not talking about TBP as a subreddit, I'm refering to Blue Pill as simply the commonly accepted beliefs of modern society. A single member of TBP community may disagree with something; that's fine. I don't agree with 100% of TRP philosophy.

That being said, things like ""just be yourself"", and ""just have confidence"" are common and pervasive tropes; no one can really deny (with any semblance of intellectual honesty) that they aren't the most common forms of advice given to both men and women. 

&gt;""men and women are the same"" Who said this, please show them for us to see.

Feminist blank slatism is rampant, just about everywhere...this is like asking me to show you proof the sky is blue...It's pratically the mantra of /r/AskWomen...

Are you literally denying that the notion that men and women are essentially interchangable aside from genitalia and that gender roles are social constructs is not a mainstream world view? Because if so, we're going to have a problem continuing this discussion...

&gt;If you, at a point in your life, tried to take dating advice from such a genre, that's kinda your fault.

I'd add in some of Eastern Europe such as Poland and Croatia for beautiful old architecture and awesome nightlife. I think France, then Italy, then Germany then maybe Netherlands, then the East would work if you're doing a few cities in each country and travelling by train (probably a good idea).

As for the gun control thing, while it is very hard for Europeans to understand, it is your country to do with as you see fit. Of course, this doesn't make you exempt from criticism. I think most intelligent Europeans recognise that American people are very different from the gov't."

First, your arrogant and racist assumption that all this ""gentrification"" seems to be happening to benefit foreigners and visitors to this country. Um, chello?

beanfiddler,circlebroke,1389844756.0,"Here's my problem with punishing people who leak things about the NSA: it was going to get out anyway. If not now, sometime later. Nothing on this large of a scale could fly under the radar for so long. And when it got out, regardless of who leaked it, it would -- and has -- damaged our international relations and reputation.

So what really is the damaging factor here? Snowden himself, or the spying? I'm going with the spying. I'm not saying that his actions are beyond reproach, or that the way he's gone about it has been extremely intelligent (use of journalists is good, fleeing to Russia is not so good). What I'm saying is that the most damaging factor to this is what the NSA has done.

I'm arguing that for an act to be treasonous, you need to do something to actively harm the country. What has harmed the country is not necessarily Snowden. Because it's pure foolishness to think that this sort of information, this level of international spying, would forever go unreported. What has harmed the country is the scope and implication of what he is exposing, not his act of exposing it.

Which is not to say that his methodology has caused no harm, but the harm it has caused is not comparable to the act of spying on allied countries in the first place."

terabyte06,NoStupidQuestions,1389844830.0,"&gt; It is a LOT more fuel efficient to coast in neutral

Maybe slightly on an older car.  Your car's computer will keep the engine in a higher gear as you're slowing down to keep the RPM low.  When the engine RPM is below a certain point, the torque converter goes into what's called a ""stall"" state (like when you're at a stop light).  In this state, the engine is almost disconnected from the transmission, and the transmission won't impart much force to slow the car down (or speed the engine up).  

Plus, if you're in a modern automatic car, the computer will cutoff fuel input to the engine as you're slowing down in gear.  It can do this because the torque converter is still turning the engine a little from the momentum of the wheels.  Without this, you have to burn fuel to keep the engine running at all.  Which alludes to:

&gt;  If you coast in drive, the engine will be running at a higher speed (RPM).

Yes, but you're using zero fuel.  Only the momentum of the wheels is turning the engine.  

You can coast farther in neutral, but you'll burn more fuel doing it.  "

So the whole point of his 'system' was basically just to *sit there*, disconnected from everything else. Of course, this is an outrageously ambitious thing for a post-grad student to do... It displays such a total detachment from the world of philosophical academia, it's small wonder he ended up going insane. The clues were all there.

For me, what's interesting about the book is that Pirsig's ideas share parallels with those of certain late 20th century French thinkers like Deleuze and Foucault. Since these people were writing around the same time as Pirsig it made sense, but I was still surprised by it. Obviously the climate in France in the late 60s/early 70s supported that kind of anti-establishment thinking to a far greater degree within academia, whereas Pirsig seems to have been bullied out by his peers. His philosophy is (admittedly) seriously underdeveloped and unacademic, with virtually his only points of reference being the pre-Socratics. Not worth studying at any length, but interesting to see how ideas growing in isolation can still be linked to other contemporary thinkers...

The other thing I enjoyed was the way the book explored the link between philosophy and mental illness. It was very honestly written too, no punches pulled... I think to get the most out of it, you need to keep reminding yourself it's an autobiography."

BooksofMagic,relationships,1389844953.0,"Thank you for respecting my beliefs.  I certainly respect everyone's right to believe what they want and that will never change.  Allow me to say a few things.

&gt; Well, I tried 'researching' the community after hearing it mentioned so many times and in such a negative light. I couldn't stomach more than ten minutes in that subreddit. I really couldn't. It was full of ugliness and hatred. Everything I saw there was toxic. When I see redpillers giving 'advice' in /r/sex and /r/relationships, it's almost always sickening. The stories other redditors have shared about the community (with substantiation - I don't just take their word for it) makes me shudder.

That's why I originally gave you a link to Married Man Sex Life, not TRP  I understand how that sub comes across with a lot of very foreign concepts to most people, especially since it's aimed solely at men.  MMSL is softer and more geared to helping men fix themselves and their troubled relationships by becoming better 'men'.

&gt;&gt;All she will hear is ""I'm weak"" no matter how you say it.
&gt;
&gt;That's not true. Yes, there are some women who will perceive male emotion as weakness, but equally there are some men ready to invalidate women's feelings (e.g. associating any emotions with hormonal shifts).

I will conceed that this not true for all people, but my own experience and observations have been that women lose attraction for displays like this unless they are already in a commited relationship, and sometimes even then.  In this case OP was literally living your own personal story which I will address in a minute.

&gt;&gt;while she's all confused
&gt;
&gt;This sounds dangerous to me. I don't know the context of the discussion you were having, but is it really advisable to approach a girl while she's confused? Is that really conducive to a healthy relationship, romantic or otherwise? 

In this case, I believe that OP's friend may have been rethinking her relationship with him after a drunken night together.  I'm sure she was confused about their relationship at that moment and it looked like an opportunity for him to try again to pursue something more, which is what he really wanted.  At the very least, it will force the issue one way or the other, which will benefit them both.

That guy was dishonest, just like the OP I was responding to.  He lied about being able to stay friends with you and handled it very badly in the end.  I believe that despite the way it went down you are now both better off having finally gotten it out in the open and dealt with it.  But you have to ask yourself at some point - why does this keep happening?  Why can I find stories similar to yours throughout the internet?  It's truly astounding how well a lot of Red Pill Theory that can perfectly explain so many of the very sad stories I have seen and heard and even experienced over the years.  I even finally understand why my first marriage went so horribly wrong.

Not let me share a story with you:

I had been a regular poster in /r/relationships for many months last year, spewing feel good politically correct advice.  I did it to distract myself from the problems at home seeking the posts of people who in similar situations, looking for more answers.   For 2 years, nothing I tried worked.  None of the talks we had were making much of a difference and I was becoming very frustrated with the situation.  We needed help but I could not get her to agree to counseling.  I felt trapped and powerless by my situation and resentment kept building.  Around the beginning of December last year, after another frustrating ""talk"" I knew that I had to try something different.  I needed, for my own conscience, to put my all into one last effort.  I'd seen the hate directed at /r/TheRedPill but I have always had a policy of judging things for myself and went in with an open mind a feeling of nothing left to lose.  I used the information there to empower myself.  I learned that the changes I wanted had to come from ME, not her, and Athol Kay has given me a roadmap to follow that has actually been working.  We both agree that our lives have been more stable, relaxed and ultimately happier in the 6 weeks since I started learning.  There is still no guarantee that things won't go south but for the first time in a long time I have real hope.  And if they do end, at the very least I will be far better prepared for it.

*Edited for grammar and redundancies.*"
sunofabeeeyetch,AskReddit,1389844956.0,"There is considerably more nuance to this than you are willing to admit, and quite frankly it is only leading to absurd conclusions when you fail to apply them as you have done thus far. You rather egregiously misrepresent my argument, and I urge you not to do so if you wish to be taken seriously at all.

The biggest issue, I suppose, is that you've ignored the critical component of responsibility entirely: agency. If an individual takes their own action without the necessary agency to legally do so, they are culpable; however, if involved in an action that would require the simultaneous consent, will, and agency of two or more parties, the individual with more agency can be seen as liable for fraud/rape/etc. 

A drunk person driving a car is an illegal action because they attempt to circumvent the prerequisite of adequate agency in doing so. It does not matter if they think they consent to it or not, what they're doing is illegal. The person is not being taken advantage of by driving a one-ton combination of metal, plastic, rubber, and gasoline; they are actively and immediately putting the lives of other people in danger, those people never having consented to being in that position in the first place. There is an immediate and present harm being done here.

A drunk person attempting to consent to a relatively sober person for sexual intercourse, however, is much different. Both persons involved can reasonably be expected to have a grasp on agency under sober and regulated circumstances; when one has agency and the other does not, however, it is the more capable person's responsibility to ensure that s/he does not engage in an action that would render this imbalance pertinent. That is to say, the sober person should not have sex with the drunken person because the former is overriding the rational capacity of the latter despite the drunk person's alleged ""consent."" This consent, even when given as enthusiastically as a drunk person can, is null and void in a court of law as diminished capability would disqualify a person from giving said consent in a binding manner (binding meaning until either the action is finished or the person changes their mind; continuing to have sex with someone who decides they do not want it anymore for any reason is also rape). A child cannot consent to sexual intercourse with an older individual no matter how enthusiastic their consent is, as their status as a minor renders them legally unable to give actual consent; they are considered to lack the prerequisite agency until they hit the age of consent, and even then only within the age group is sexual intercourse allowed.

Your arguments amount to seeing intoxication in a binary that simply does not work in a complex society like the one we inhabit today. You veer to extremes and claim them mutually exclusive, when in reality the necessary information to declare guilt or innocence is much more complex and must be interpreted fully. Context of what happens is everything; responsibility is not magically absolved because of one factor. That is to say, drunk driving != drunk sex because the very nature of both actions are completely different, and the only thing they have in common is intoxication. Does sex involve stepping on a gas pedal and propelling a vehicle? Does driving involve the insertion of a penis into an orifice? They do not, and to compare the two is ridiculous. You're essentially treating Mr. X like a car instead of a human being in this analogy, and by doing so you attempt to absolve him of any responsibility he has. Sure, it is not the car's fault a drunk individual tries to drive one, but a person has much higher rational capacity than a car. "

 I don't think using the celebrities that women find attractive is an accurate gauge for determining what women want in a real life partner. 
 In real life, when you have to spend every day with someone, your ability to laugh with one another is much more of a priority than whether or not that person looks like a fitness model. 'Sexy' celebrities have manufactured personas that are fun to fantasize about, but aren't suitable for a long term relationship. 

If you're talking about just hookups/sex/ONS, then I don't think it's any secret that some women look for nothing but a hot body. Some women will also get involved with a guy purely because he has money and status or fame. The women that I have interacted with in my life put more value on personality and humor than either of those things. So I think it depends on the woman, but I don't think the desire for a sense of humor in a long term partner is overstated. "

screenmagnet,sex,1389845228.0,"I was the one who brought up pegging to my bf. It had been a fantasy of mine since I was a teen. And I have always been on the dominant side in the bedroom (although I now consider myself a switch). But even *I* had some reservations about actually pegging my bf. I knew it was irrational, but I was afraid that I would lose attraction to my him or find the sight of him with a dildo in his ass to be a turn off. I was afraid that the act would feminize him in my eyes. I was also afraid that if I pegged him, he would want to become exclusively submissive in bed. In retrospect, I believe much of these fears stemmed from watching pegging porn, which generally has too much gender bending, theatrical type femdomme, and sissy type emasculation in it for my taste.

Well, turns out all my fears we're unfounded. The visuals of him with a dildo in his mouth and his ass were HOT. (Although, strangely, to this day, the sight of any guy other than my bf getting pegged or sucking off a dildo is an intense turn off; for some reason that I can't fully understand, my bf is the only man I've seen look hot with a dildo inside him). In addition, pegging brought us really close together, which resulted in him becoming less inhibited in bed in general, and he told me a lot of kinks that he had been holding back on. And it turned out that most of those kinks involved him aggressively dominating me and degrading me in bed, but he had always been too afraid to talk to me about that. So, ironically, it was only after I started pegging him that he finally felt comfortable enough to let his dominant side out in bed. And I discovered that my submissive side was far more extensive than I ever suspected. Before pegging, we mostly had vanilla sex or mild dominance from me. After we introduced pegging, we now have lots of strong dominance from him, much stronger submission from me, and also occasional strong submission from him. So overall our sex life had become way kinkier with more polarized power dynamics, and we have both become strong switches. And in another ironic twist, finally seeing his dominant side come out in bed has actually made him appear much more viscerally masculine in my eyes, both inside and outside of the bedroom.

So that's my story of how pegging, in a wholly unexpected twist of fate, ended up actually shifting the overall power dynamic of our sex life toward greater dominance *from him*, and as a result, vastly emphasized his masculinity in my eyes!

Who knew that all I needed to do was to peg his ass in order to get him to admit that he had always wanted to choke me, slap me across the face, tie me up, fuck my face, fuck my ass, fist my pussy, and piss on my face. And who knew it would take pegging him for me to realize that I actually wanted him to do all that degrading stuff to me!

Moral of the story: indulging in kinks can change your life in unexpected and counterintuitive ways!"

One day Billy brings in his dad's handgun and is showing it off to us; and asks us if we want to shoot it (at school). We tell him that's dumb and that we should go guard the tires instead. The school had some kick ass tires that were bigger than we were that we liked to play in.

Life-in-Death,AskReddit,1389845629.0,"Okay.  Two things to think of though:

1. There does seem to be a distinction between day to day relations and romantic relations.  Most of the ""advantages"" only come to play in the second scenario.  When you and your female coworker are going out you are not paying for her meal and she will happily get the door for you.  Should things be different on dates?  Probably.  Even if cash is still 50/50, dates include things like pulling out chairs and walking on the outside of the sidewalk.  Are these *advantages*?  They are more ritualized actions that show interest.  Do they stem from sexism?  Sure?  Does continuing them perpetuate sexism?  Sure.  But in the initial stages of a relationship virtually all animals have ritualized displays.  These actions can let you know: is this person into me, or is it just lunch?  So, we would just have to come up with a new set of signals, otherwise we would both be holding out the chair for one another and holding on to each others bicep on the street.  Or can a society move from gender-neutral in the workplace and guy-and-gal on dates?  I don't know.

2. Let's also look at these ""advantages""  You probably saw the reddit post about a guy who posed as a girl on OK cupid because he thought it must be so great to be on the receiving end of so much attention.  He couldn't take the grossness after 2 hours.  All that ""attention"" you get walking down the street may seem fun if it hasn't happened to you.  And ""drinks in bars.""  It is a Catch-22.  A guy will send you a drink, okay, now you are ""obligated"" to talk to him.  If a guy asks to buy you a drink, saying no can seem extremely rude as you have to communicate: I don't want your drink AND go away or it is ""No thanks"" and you are stuck talking to them anyway.  So, you usually say yes and particularly if you don't like him you will buy him one back.   But now you have been trapped with this person for two drinks.   
Short of saying ""Please step away from me"" if you are sitting at a bar you are usually trapped.  If you say ""I just want to be alone or with a friend"" then you look like a bitch if you start talking to another guy.  Usually what happens when my friends and I go out (if we are open to meeting people) if a guy we are not interested in offers to buy us drinks we just say we were leaving after the one we have.  Then we go to another bar.  I mean, I am happy I never have to cold approach males, but just being selected on doesn't always get you the desired results.  (Yes, I am aware I can approach guys.)  
All the other ""lady like"" advantages are often what keep women on the ""out.""  A group of men often feel like they can't be themselves if a woman is there.  This was a major barrier in the military, sports journalism, etc."

CapOnFoam,nutrition,1389845692.0,"My recommendation is moderation. Try everything you want to try and enjoy the experience. I wouldn't avoid anything you're curious about (well, maybe Durian haha), simply because the experience TO ME is worth a few extra calories. In terms of your whole life, 2.5 weeks is nothing, and avoiding trying a new &amp; interesting cultural food because it's an extra 300 calories is missing out on part of the experience, IMO.

That said, there is plenty of healthy stuff to eat in those countries. I'd highly recommend the Indian food in Singapore (if you like spicy, you'll do well). There is a lot of vegan food at the Buddhist temples in Malaysia, which I found really interesting to try, and it's quite healthy. Plenty of seafood there as well, much of it steamed or grilled. 

There are a lot of open air markets with tons of produce &amp; other plant-based snacks (and fish, chicken, etc), and I'd take heavy advantage of those. You could pick up some fruit (get some rambutan &amp; mangosteen!) and use that for snacks. I also loved tapioca chips - like taro, a bit - though those are deep-fried. Ice Kacang in malaysia is a fun dessert - shaved ice with gelatin, red beans, and some other things (not sure....). A common breakfast there is Nasi Lemak, which is anchovies and coconut rice. If you get it on the go, it's in a reasonable portion and wrapped in a banana leaf.

That was a bit wordy, but... enjoy your trip. I hope that was somewhat helpful. The food there is so flavorful, it's easy to just eat a normal sized portion of it and be satisfied.

The natural logarithm is just a specific logarithm with the base e. Since it's a very common logarithm in math (especially in calculus), it has its own notation, which is ln(x). So ln(x) is the same as log_e(x) but it's almost always written as ln(x) because it's more convenient."

If a time signature can be reduced (like 10/8), then it implies it's compound, meaning it can be split in two perfectly, and there is always an emphasis on, in this case, the 6th eighth note in a bar of 10/8. The only difference between 10/8 and 5/8 is basically that 10/8 will normally have the same chords or notes twice, making it one bar instead of two."

You're thinking about linemen.

Once they retire, a decent amount of those players drop excess fat.

It is agreed upon that disclosure should always be done before sex and in a safe environment. Yes, some girls are hesitant and scared. Considering trans people have often been killed for telling potential partners these things, can you blame them?

I also love how the concern you are showing is that a hypothetical someone could maybe have ""gay"" sex with a trans woman that is presenting female and has a vagina. Let's ignore the part where he finds out and murders her.

When I have kids, I'll definitely attempt to have a home birth with a midwife.

I don't know, man. 

NFC seems like it would get whatever it wanted in the run game with that offensive line. The box would be stacked no doubt and having YAC threats in Harvin, Crab, and ~~Percy~~ Tate, any defense is going to be gassed. 

The defense may be one of the greatest of all time. It's built to stop the run, combining two of the best pass rushes in the game with how versatile the line is and the linebackers are nuts. I think that AFC's run game gets stuffed and that a lot of yards are surrendured in the passing game, but has little success in the red zone with that secondary and LB scrunched so close together--it'd be near impossible to throw into that. AFC has red zone threats, but the NFC has size to defend it as well. 

If the NFC can run the ball and control the clock, I think it could survive the AFC passing attack. Of course all of this is overtly simplified and coming from a biased eye. I think over all the NFC defense is better than the AFC offense.

I advise women to think very, very carefully before putting hormones in their body. Are you okay with the possibility of losing your sex drive for a very long time or possibly even permanently? If not, consider non-hormonal forms of birth control. Also, you need to be aware that there is a slight increased risk of blood clots and pre-menopausal breast cancer. Yes, these are very rare side effects, but extremely deadly ones. In my personal opinion, I think the side effects and risks of hormonal birth control are only worth it if you have some other condition which they treat (like PCOS)  OR if you are not willing to have a kid but also not willing to have an abortion."

raging-moderate,love,1389846457.0,"I don't see anyone commenting on this, so I suppose I'll give it a try.  this is admittedly an unusual situation and not one that most people can relate to.  The immediate urge is for me to say, 'you need to back away from this immediately,' but I don't think you're going to listen to that.  

Your Uncle (in other words parents-brother) is probably in a really fucked up mindset given that he's about to go put his life at risk every day for over a year.  Your mom seems to realize something is amiss, but doesn't know exactly what and doesn't want to make odd-sounding accusations.  You are 18 and newly learning what it means to have adult relationships regardless of whatever argument you are thinking against that right now.  The first time or first few times that a person of the opposite sex takes interest in you, it feels so real, so life-bendingly explicitly important, but most 20- and 30-somethings or older will typically tell you they did not end up with their first love(s).  Obviously, you won't.

The likelihood of his continued interest in you is somewhat low.  He's got at least a year or more of war in front of him, full of distractions and the constant threat of death.  You have whatever is following high school for you, including the minimum half year or so left of partying and, as you put it, not being faithful.  
From your writing style, you sound very young and much like you have a lot of world- and life-experiences yet to be had.  I would chalk this whole situation up to personal experience, keep it as a memory, and put it out of your thoughts.  Do your party thing, don't be faithful to your Uncle, and move on with your life."

RandianHero,malehairadvice,1389846470.0,"With your build, stay away from haircuts that make you look like a Q-tip. Also, dressing and styling your hair to fit into a certain scene is for dorks. Do what makes you look good. Luckily for you, the haircut that would fit you best also works for the crowd you want to associate with. Go short on the sides and back and leave the top and front longer (don't let the bangs go lower than your eyebrows, though). That way, you can still look presentable without looking out of place in your particular scene."

I never had any problems with it. My periods became lighter, I never get cramps anymore, and I never have to worry about taking a pill or anything other than a bi monthly feel up there to make sure the strings are still there.

I have depression so that may have a lot more to do with my acne and lower sex drive than the IUD does. I'm switching to the copper IUD this Friday to see if that's the case.

she got my friend for a ton of money, money he gave her in good faith plus money forcibly taken from him via wage garnishment. from my understanding the mother didn't want the father to interfere in her raising the kid....the kid she dropped off with the grandmother who took care of the kid for years. so mom got to keep her single life then got to be the mom when she wanted and in the end got a huge cash check for being a manipulative monster.

Now the kicker for the libs is that when we say to put armed guards in schools, they've begun firing back, to the liberals I've talked to on Twitter, citing the recent theater shooting where a retired cop shot a man who was being noisy.

Best way I have found to combat this is to always mention that the tool being used is never at fault, blaming the tool is silly. The person using the tool is always at fault, 100%, 100% of the time. With that, I have yet to hear a decent response. 

Also, the retired cop allegedly had aggression built into his training as a police officer for one reason or another, and so his former training may have instilled various ticks, possibly mental issues such as PTSD from his time on the force."

Nearby, there's this ashram-town called [Auroville](http://www.auroville.org/). It's pretty cool. It's mostly inhabited by settled foreign people, again mostly French.

These two towns have some *amazing* beaches right next to them. So that's there as well. Plus, [Mahabalipuram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabalipuram) is very close by as well, a jewel of South Indian heritage and ancient culture and history.

The Government of Canada requires logging companies replant all the land they clear, so they hire reforestation companies to plant so many trees back in these cut blocks of clear land. Last spring/summer I headed to Clearwater, British Columbia to complete a few contracts. The average experienced planter can plant around 2000 seedlings a day and get payed per tree. 

Tree planters push their physical and mental limits and can burn about 4000 calories a day. We work in all weather conditions, and up on those mountains it can be hot and sunny one minute, and hailing the next. 

This moment captures my planting partner (right) and I (left) shooting the shit after a long day. This was close to the end of our second month of living out in the wilderness.

Second:  Make it a game,  when other girls hit on your man; Take Pride!  Be happy that other women find your man attractive, play along, make him feel incredibly wanted.  Don't be a psycho bitch about it, instead you should flirt with him in front of her, even if she is outright flirting with him to annoy you.

In short,  you take away her power by letting her know you aren't threatened; and you make him feel comfortable, and wanted, by demonstrating that you know he is attractive, it is perfectly okay for other women to notice he is attractive, and you find it fun to play along with it.

Instead of being jealous, make it a turn-on.  As a guy, I made this switch and suddenly going out together became a lot more fun.

But you have to trust him not to stray just because some cow is making eyes at him.  Otherwise jealous is just jealous, and it may be cute at times, but it is not really attractive on you.

Flirting is a game, and many men don't realize how much/well they flirt back. Make it YOUR game together so that you both enjoy it.  Turnabout should be fair play though if a guy starts hitting on you.   Would you prefer he do something like the above, or be macho and want to hit the guy?"

umilmi81,AdviceAnimals,1389846877.0,"Helping people understand that pay is not arbitrary.  It is relevant to the fast food minimum wage debate.  Pay is a function of what you bring in to the company.  If legislation sets your wage higher than the money you bring in to the company then they are employing you at a loss.  If a company is losing money by employing you they will (they must) fire you to increase their profit.  Only the most skilled people will be left.  Unskilled people will be unemployed and unemployable because nobody is ever going to hire someone at a loss with the hope that someday they may generate profit for the company.

You see the outcome of this in countries like France where there are very strict and ""progressive"" employment policies.  Hiring someone is such a major commitment that companies won't take a chance on anyone under the age of 30.  When you hire someone it may be for their entire life.

cahman,circlejerk,1389847124.0,"Comprendes*

The Spanish verb Comprender (to comprehend/understand/etc.) can be conjugated in the following ways (minus Spain's weird a/eis )

**Yo (I) form**: *Comprendo*

**Tu (you) form**: *Comprendes* (You are using this form as you are talking to the OP)

**El/Ella/Udsted (he/she/you (formal) and it) form**: *Comprende*

**Nosotros (we) form**: *Comprendemos*

**Ellos/Ellas/Udstedes (Mixed/male group of people/female only group of people/group of people (can also be seen as ""you guys"")**: *Comprenden* (If you are talking to everyone in this thread you would use this form, but I don't think that you mean it that way)

In fact, the other kinds of verbs (-ar and -ir) are exactly the same except you change the ""e"" to whatever other vowel it is.
For instance, the verb *hablar*, to speak. If you wanted to say ""I speak"" you would say Yo Hablo (Or if you're lazy just Hablo, as since the verb ends with an O it's assumed that you are talking in the Yo form.) 

An example of an -ir verb is *vivir*, to live. If you wanted to say ""We live"" you would say (nosotros) vivimos.

Guest_Acct,short,1389847207.0,"&gt; From everything I have read part of the reason that humans are taller now then compared to way back in the day is that humans started eating better as agriculture developed. This better eating means more nutritional food which helps the body grow. This lead to humans being taller then in the past. I haven't read or heard anywhere that the change in height was due to social implications.

Actually, people got shorter when agriculture first came on the scene because they didn't understand nutrition.  They ate less variety and developed all kinds of problems due to a lack of certain elements required in their diets.  Only in the last 100 years have we begun to properly understand nutrition as well as have a varied diet.

sunofabeeeyetch,AskReddit,1389847209.0,"The problem with what you're saying is that it's simply flat-out wrong and lacking in any deeper analysis that would adequately defend your position. I won't get into the difficulties of the age of consent, but the mind-state of the individuals involved is very much a factor in determining whether they are culpable for an action or not. Murder and manslaughter are not the same crimes because of this; a person whose vehicle skids on black ice due to a freak malfunction and then runs over someone is not nearly as criminally liable as another who deliberately directed their vehicle towards their victim via swerving towards them. Similarly, crimes of passion are prosecuted less harshly than deliberate, coldly calculated crimes of the same outcome. 

That you think you can't change your mind is rather troubling and perhaps indicative of a fundamental difference in our viewpoints here; you think whoever consents to anything should be bound by law to commit to it without any chance of recourse otherwise, while I say such a view is disturbingly restrictive and frankly idiotic.

You're also forgetting or ignoring entirely what I just said about agency. The important thing here is that the person with higher rational capacity is responsible for the actions s/he commits towards an individual with less rational capacity regardless of whether the latter attempts to consent; for example, an adult will be charged with distribution of alcohol to minors even if solicited by a teenager to buy beer. The teenager clearly consents to a monetary and material exchange, as does the adult, but the law recognizes the adult to be more capable in making a rational decision and thus prosecutes them. It doesn't matter that the teenager made a bad decision on their own; what matters is that someone who should know better willingly facilitates said decision to a point of harm. You put way too much of a burden on the person who cannot reasonably be expected to make clear, rational, and informed decisions and completely ignore the responsibility of the person who can be expected to do so. That's the problem--you're oversimplifying the issue to the point that you're reaching utterly absurd conclusions. A car is not a man, and a man is not a car. A car takes one person to perform certain actions with. A sober man requires a sober woman to enthusiastically consent to perform sexual intercourse with. Notice that it takes both parties involved in the latter in order for sex to be legitimate. Both parties are required to give consent and be responsible. If a woman is obviously drunk, a sober man should therefore be responsible enough to refuse her advances as he has the ability (and obligation) to do so.

And just as an addendum, in many sovereign states it *is* illegal for bartenders to serve alcohol to those who are obviously intoxicated. If a customer dies of alcohol poisoning upon visiting a bar (where all alcohol consumed was presumably purchased from) the deceased's family may have a legitimate lawsuit against the bar or bartender."

At that point it could be question if driver development for *non-perfect architecture* is worth it. Even AMD wont provide support below HD7000 -series as far what I have found about it.

Honestly, I don't think these people have any common sense. Culture is a shared experience.

It's good that your boyfriend is supportive of you, and unfortunately anxiety can strain a relationship, but it should never annoy him. If he is annoyed in your time of need, he might not understand how debilitating anxiety can be and this is unfortunate. Hopefully he can continue to support you in a positive way.

You are doing all you can do at this moment to aid your health. What happened in your past is, and there is nothing you can do to change it. What you can change, and it sounds like what you are changing, is your lifestyle now. That is incredibly healthy, and in this situation, all you can do. Hopefully these healthy habits can become anxiety-reducing for you.

It's normal to have stress upon an impending doctors appointment. You have done the right thing by making this appointment, and upon hearing your check-up results, your mind may be put more at ease. Is your appointment with a generalized physician? If so, perhaps you can discuss your anxious nature with him if it has been an issue in your life prior to your decision to make a doctors' appointment.

Sorry I don't have more insight, like I said I'm in a very similar boat to you. I've managed to tame thoughts like yours by telling myself that I'm doing what I can to be healthy. Also, as strange as it sounds, it helps me to always have my cellphone with me. In case I have to call somebody, an ambulance, whatever, it is almost a security blanket to know that I have a potential escape of a panicky situation. I hope this helps, and you're not crazy or alone."

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1389847369.0,"I'm not a salesman, however I've done a lot of research, both as a hobby and to prepair myself for when I'm ready to buy a car. Not to mention I've learned a lot from other peoples experience. 

Its almost never worth it to buy a car right off the lot because it is going to lose a huge chunk of its value right off the bat. 

Especially with newer models, like the new Mitsubishi Mirage hatchback, it depends on the market so you don't know if that car will retain value well or not. Plus, very little is known about the car as no one has had the chance to drive it for an extended period of time. WE don't know if it'll be the Next Civic or Corolla, or the next Renault Le Car. 

If you want a ""new"" car, go with something a few years old and at least broken in and long enough for some actual reviews to pop up also so the price can level out. 

If you do desperately want a brand spanking new car, research to see how much value the car will lose when taking it off the lot and try to haggle the difference. MY old boss' daughter HAD to have a brand new Mercedes. She fought the guy supposedly for 3 hours, but got $5000 taken off the sticker price and a better warranty. 

Also, its usually a bad idea to buy the very first refresh of a generation; example: The new Mustangs that are out? Might want to wait at least a year or two anyways as auto maker tend to use these cars as guinea pigs for new or tweaked technology and it's up to the consumers (the people they're trying to please anyways) to guide them along for improvements. 

However, you can get a very good deal on past generations if a new one has come out. Dealers are like birds. They like and want new and shiny things and have the attention span of a cocker spaniel with severe AD/HD - it's the business. 

Another example: lets say it's [2004](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSmYO0X4oSa384sc094o0lAzuvSUmF3LgagjJSn3Lg7u6Nm74cE), but the new, more refined, more luxurious [2005 Toyota Avalon](http://images.thecarconnection.com/lrg/2005_toyota_avalon_100008604_l.jpg) has just hit show rooms. You bet your bippy that the sales man (or woman) is going to do whatever it takes to get the 2004 models out of the showroom to make room for the 2005 models.

No one should be able to force another human capable of consent to either undergo a medical procedure without their consent (abortion or otherwise), or to undergo a huge physical and emotional burden of bearing a child that they do not want to bear. The owner of a uterus should always have the final say for how that uterus is used and whether or not it's used to produce a child. Until the event that children can be conceived and brought to full gestational maturity outside of a uterus, the owner of said uterus still gets a say for how it's used. 

Edit: And by the way, if a man has a uterus (e.g., a trans man) and this issue comes up, I believe in the same principle - they would still get the ultimate choice about how their body was used. "

Montuckian,technology,1389847621.0,"There's a bunch of major things that make vehicle manufacturers different than other large advertisers.  The biggest of these is the fact that they don't actually sell consumers their products, rather they sell wholesale to dealerships who then sell at retail.  They also heavily use coop advertising with their dealers, which is really problematic when it comes to a medium that isn't regulated by territory.

Both of these things make paid placement on social media very difficult to achieve at the manufacturer level and much better executed by the dealerships themselves.

This is also why vehicle manufacturers use broadcast media to great effect.  It's very, very easy for them to purchase national advertising at a static rate that changes little from year to year.  

It's important to keep in mind too that this national advertising is the manufacturer holding up their end of the bargain with their dealerships.  Since dealers are private (unless you're Tesla) dealerships can decide to change brands at certain points and will do so if they feel like they're not supported by the brand.

If I were a betting man, it would be my guess that there was internal pressure from dealers themselves that made GM pull social, but that's just my opinion.

And there was no loss in the 18-34 demo, it was the 18-25 demo that was reduced.  The 25-34 demo jumped 33% and added 11MM users.  If I were Facebook, I'd be ecstatic over this.  And if that didn't start my engine, I'd look down the list to each of the older demos that grew even greater than the 25-34.

That's great fucking news, plain and simple.

13-24 is a crap demo to advertise into.  These guys don't have disposable income and they don't buy high ticket items which needs to happen to maintain a respectable AOV which supports the low CTR on Facebook.

The thing you have to remember here is that tech investors aren't looking for a 20-year payoff, they're looking for less than 10.  Remember that 15 years ago in the dot com bubble, AOL was the biggest kid on the block.  We have zero idea what the next big thing is next year, or in five years, or in 15 years.  We don't even know what it will be built on.

But the one thing I can say is that if I'm a tech investor, I see the demo change to the positive in 25+ and I'm stoked.  You know why?  Because, as AOL will tell you, those guys aren't going anywhere now."

If you say, ""Make yourself ugly so you will have friends,"" then yeah, that's a terrible message. I remember it being, ""Share your stuff and be nice. Friends are good."" Rainbow Fish liked his scales, they made him happy. He didn't want to share because he thought it would make him less happy. Turns out, when you share your happiness with others, it makes them happy, and seeing other people happy makes you even happier. 

IMHO, ""You won't be as beautiful, but you will have friends,"" is saying that beauty is not important and friends are important. I think that's something everyone can get behind: Relationships are more important that superficial things. Don't think you are better than someone because you are pretty.

oldmonty,tf2,1389848269.0,"Its not really like comparing it to the bat because the bat is in a different loadout slot. The whole point of the soda popper is its secondary ability to add jumps(previously minicrits) if you think of it that way even the name tells you what its supposed to be about. 

If you factor the random critical hits into the damage equation I'm sure you would see that the FaN has a higher average damage output, as is the point of the weapon, but disabling features of the game that the developers put in there just because you dont like them definitely skews the game. 

Imo random critical hits are kind of annoying but I understand why they had to be there and the way they are implemented is very important to why they work in the game. The whole idea that as your damage or heal output is increased your random crit chance is also makes the game balance out with certain weapons where if you have been doing consistent damage not getting that crit is a major downside for you. 

I hate when people say stuff like
&gt; they act as a mechanic that provides forgiveness to unskilled players in environments where they could be completely steamrolled by veteran player

As if the developers would want the game to behave this way. 

The soldier wouldnt be the soldier if it werent for random crits, part of the soldier class is that you just spit out random crits. The description for the class is ""The soldier is going to be putting out the most damage"" if you remove part of his damage stream then he is inferior in pretty much every way compared to the demoman except maybe he is easier to use if you are just picking up the game for the first time. There's even the achievement ""crockets are such bs"". "

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1389848362.0,"I didn't get enough guidance growing up so learning things on my own took quite a while. Forums like this one where a lot of angry/confused men congregated didn't exist (or I never bumped into them). I found this and others quite late for myself, but at least I can share some positive ideas and solutions to others that might need it.

My mother actually fit a lot of the nasty stereotypes espoused in this sub. She was physically and emotionally abusive, and manipulative. A lot of the ideas/strategies talked about here worked fantastically for me when I finally implemented them... It was effective to a comical level.

My mother often hit me with lighter stuff that wouldn't leave long-lasting, visible damage. She usually had a long blinds-tilter wand ready and it was enough to keep me in line, cowered. I forgot when or why I started working out / lifting, but I think that is when I started growing a spine. She had to hit harder and harder to get any response from me... until one day she used too much force and it snapped against my forearm that I put in the way. She gave up on the physical abuse all together when she later hurt her wrist trying to hit me with something beefier -- the ol' trusty rolling pin. *""Are you ok?""* as I took it away from her. No response, so I continued. *""Good. Don't bother anymore. No use.""*

I think lifting or physical exercise in general was what set everything off. The testosterone, pain &amp; gain mentality, and growth I felt gave me a sense of power and confidence I didn't have before and helped me deal with depression... which was important because my mother was impossible to please. My father was a lot more reasonable and set stable goals, but my mother's goals changed with how well she *perceived* other kids were doing. 

She had emotional manipulation down to an art. She'd tell little lies that sometimes seem inconsequential, until you eventually realize she's just testing you, to see how far her lying skills can get her. When you let her get away with it, she'd try her ""goal-oriented"" lies. Just one example of many: exaggerating the achievements of others to make you feel like shit and that you need to achieve more. Standing up to her physically indirectly improved my emotional resistance to her manipulation. I called her out more often:

*""No, mom. It's not possible that Jimmy has a 4.9 GPA. There are only N number of advanced placement courses that give 5.0 for A's at our school. There are M number of mandatory non-AP courses that cannot be replaced by taking equivalents at our local community college during the summer. He had to have taken at least K of them which would bog his GPA down with 4.0's. I already worked it out. It's mathematically impossible.""*

She had a heavy duty rationalization engine running her mind. She thought all this abuse was for my own good. E.g. She would often tell me that I *needed* to be successful in life because I'm too short, ugly, and socially awkward to ever find someone to marry. Just to note, I'm only a bit under average male height, and in retrospect actually had a ton of friends at every stage of my life from kindergarten onwards... So she was obviously exaggerating, but it still really pissed me off hearing that shit from her all the time, despite her ""probable intention"" of motivating me.

The pattern was the same as with many other women I see complained about here. The more dependent I was on my parents, the more abusive she could afford to be. It has to do with leverage (financial, emotional, physical, whatever). While I don't ""spin plates"" behind people and prefer more honest approaches to relationships, I can understand the sentiment and strategy behind it as well as ""dread game"". It's about having options and not become too beholden to another person. 

When I started working part-time, and became less financially dependent (with the help of scholarships), the emotional abuse subsided significantly. When I got a job after college, it disappeared entirely.

I have a positive relationship with her now, and not just because I bought her a new car. It has a lot to do with having independence and power over my own situation (financially and emotionally), and setting boundaries. Those are needed regardless of whether we're talking about family, friends, romantic partners, etc. If she still disrespected me, like back then, I'd be hearing complaints about how the car was under 20k in value, because she was never satisfied. I am completely fucking serious about that. Now, she's a very satisfied and happy woman at least in relation to me. I taught my younger brother to be strong against her as well. My father is still beta towards her, but she had left him alone ever since he got cancer.

I also don't have any hard feelings either (as far as I'm consciously aware of), because there's not much point. First off, child abuse is pretty common among the lower classes and I would not have been better off with foster parents. Secondly, *that's just how she is* and was brought up. She had a very tough life as well. Her traumatizing hysterical fits were born from irrationality, but the *feelings* were real. Besides, it's not like her ""plans"" didn't work. She bought into the American dream (and the romanticized wild west), and her elaborate plan was for the family to slowly climb up the socioeconomic ladder from country to country, city to city, until arriving at a place like the Silicon Valley where either me or a sibling started or joined a startup and then become a multimillionaire. Really... It worked for my younger brother. Really. 

I'm not rich, but I'm pretty happy and secure right now myself, so you could say that her laughably elaborate plan worked for her kids after all. I guess you could say I'm well past the ""anger"" stage at least in relation to her."

LucasSatie,CrohnsDisease,1389848422.0,"Everyone experiences the shots differently. Some have extreme pain that may last for a considerable amount of time (I've read as much as 48 hours) while others may have little to no pain.

Personally, I fall closer to the ""less pain"" end of the spectrum. The pain I get is similar to a bee sting and only lasts a maximum of thirty seconds. The pain, for me, comes from the actual injecting of the liquid. You can experience the difference if you switch to the pre-filled syringes (as opposed to the pens) since you control how quickly the liquid is injected.

Usually, the pain is related to the amount of muscle and/or body fat in the location you inject. For instance, my thighs have very little to no body fat and thus the injections hurt **much** worse there. My stomach has a small layer of body fat which I believe ""cushions the blow"" so to speak."

* 289 Seeds
* 126 bonemeal used

test #3:

* 384 Blue Orchids

* 124 bonemeal used

The lower bonemeal count must be from the adjustment to the repeater distribution due to the larger 7x7 platform. Roughly 7,440-7,560 bonemeal per hour.

Average flower production is ~340 blue orchids per minute, or 20,440 per hour. So I'm guessing blue orchids grow more frequently than the average flower."

2. Gender Inequality. Kind of a stretch, but rural Republicans tend to agree with and perpetuate gender control (women are supposed to do this, men are supposed to do this). Collectively in America, there's a lot more leniency on what women choose to act like, but there's still a line of control (or pressure) that drives people away from acting different.
3. Racial Inequality. A bit more of a stretch, but Republicans tend to discriminate against races or altogether have racist views towards people more often than Democrats or Independents.

Points left: 30

I'm born and raised in a good country. My family is stable. Being old money or new money would probably ruin my personality. I'd like to be able to choose my sex; maybe I want to be a guy, maybe I want to be a gal. I just want to make that choice even if I just flip a coin. Race and all the other stuff doesn't matter and chances are I'll be in the majority which just makes things easier anyways. Being able to choose my basic asset will make my life easier too. Slightly taller or even average and good looking is never a disadvantage.

Perks

1. Gifted -10
2. Healthy -10
3. Charmer -10

Being gifted is enough. I don't want to be a genius or I'd probably wouldn't have a normal childhood for being too intelligent. I won't have to worry too much about my heath and I can stay in shape with minimal effort (not too skinny or too fat). Being a charmer will allow me to make the friends that I want to and not make the enemies that I don't. My stable life is set.

I don't want soulmate or BFF. I'd rather know that I'll be getting things out of my own efforts than having things handed to me. Kind of hypocritical with the charmer perk but it's not the same. Making friends and keeping friends are two different things."

Simbablk,sex,1389848861.0,"This is a great question.  With my experiences with FMF, it was a little different.  

Condoms were used with my very first FMF experience.  Whenever I went to fuck the other woman, a new condom was put on.  That meant we went through an entire box of 12 condoms before I finally came. 

But another session was without condoms.  We all had STI/STD testing before fucking.  Knowing we were all clean, we opted for no condoms.  Being able to go from woman to woman was so easy!  

But then there are times when the two women don't know each other and don't care to have the other woman's juices in her pussy.  In those cases, a quick wipe (a wet towel or wipes are good in these cases) is a good enough.  Pull out, wipe off the juices, and enter the other woman.  No one has ever complained about that.

p3ndulum,poker,1389849027.0,"He shouldn't be 3-betting at all.

An unpaired hand will connect with the flop ~1/3 times, and he's probably going to get called - if not re-raised - in at least two spots. Which means he's pretty much out-flopped even before the cards are dealt.

3-betting also gives away the strength if his hand, which means that his opponents are going to be able to play correctly against him, which means that he'll only win small pots when he wins and large ones when loses.

With a raise from UTG, he should be playing his Tens OOP the same way he should play a pair of 9s - for set value, only losing 3 BB's when he hates the flop while setting himself up nicely to win at least 44 when he flops a set (which would be tremendous value for his 3 BB's).

Between pricing himself out of set value, having a high probability of being out-flopped by one of two opponents, there being very few flops he could get a lot of action on from worse hands, as well as the chance the UTG raiser could already have him beat, 3-betting *at all*, let alone for *more* is a huge mistake in this spot."

ChangloriousBastard,technology,1389849114.0,"I think he has a fairly reasonable point, if not with the right words. As we learned with the housing bubble, our banks have a bad habit of over leveraging their assets and subjecting themselves to the mercy of bad investments.

The stock in the article was manipulated not just by dumb people, but also by speculators looking to get in and quickly to make a quick buck. Sure, the volume traded was low, but I'm willing to bet that a big chunk of the activity was done by professional traders who knew exactly what they were doing.

The way our markets work, there is more money to be made by trading on the margins than by holding long. 

That's an obvious problem when financial institutions wager their ability to function on volatile and overvalued markets. They come in, invest in speculative instruments (overvalued mortgages, derivatives, bubble stocks), and hope to sell before the bubble pops.

When the bubble does pop, banks lose their ability to lend money or honor their obligations. Debt becomes expensive and other sectors of the economy are left with cash flow problems and outrageous interest rates.

This article is a great microcosm for the greater problems that plague the economy. Our market isn't based on strong fundamentals, it moves on what's hot, regardless of the actual strength of what's being invested in."

Personal ~~story~~ novel time:

The first job I got after graduating college wasn't in my field, but I had finally been able to get a car, and needed money to support it. So I got a job at a marketing research place in the mall. You know, the people who ask you to do surveys and then pay you.

So I'm two weeks into this job when the assistant manager has a screaming match with the manager, in front of respondents (people taking the surveys) and storms out, yelling ""fuck you"" and all kinds of other things. I was trying desperately to pay attention to my respondent and hoping against all hope she wouldn't walk out in the middle, because it would put us behind. (You have no idea how few people stop to do surveys. It is a shitty, high-pressure job that is literally meaningless.)

The manager pulls me aside - ME! 21 year old me that had been there two weeks. Not either of the other two older adult women that had been there for months. Not the old man that had been working there with the manager for years. Me. And she asks if I would be interested in becoming the assistant manager. Because ""I can tell you're really smart.""

Not having any luck looking in my field, and having my confidence majorly boosted (assistant manager after two weeks?) I agree. The manager teaches me the ropes, and all goes well for about two months. And then, there it is. The first survey on my watch where we didn't fully meet the quota by the deadline. (Always a Sunday. As the assistant manager, I worked Saturday and Sunday, while the manager didn't.) I felt awful. It wasn't my fault we didn't find a hispanic woman 40-45 that most often used ragu brand pasta sauce! (The only option left based on the number of people and categories we had been assigned.) Corporate called us every 20 minutes to make sure it got done after we hit the 5PM mark. (Mall closed at 6, but the movie theater stayed open later.) I called my manager in tears over the unnecessary pressure, and she helped me through it.

Then, two month later, corporate bounces everyone's paycheck. Soon after this, one of the employees that asks people to do surveys gets back on oxycontin. She has several days in a row where she brings in about two people, compared to her average of 6-7. She decides to quit, and argues with the manager over it. She then calls one of the companies we did surveys for and tells them that all we do all day is lie and make up respondents and make up survey answers. Well, they call corporate, and corporate calls my manager, screams at her on the phone for 5 minutes straight, then hangs up. Then calls back 10 minutes later. Repeat all day.

While this is going on, we are trying desperately to get respondents for a survey for parents of kids 4 - 12 that wet their bed at night. (Unsurprisingly, no parent in the mall would admit that their 4-12 year old wet the bed.) So corporate is also calling and literally screaming at us over the phone about not having done a single survey on this job, when X number of other locations were already on different phases of the project. (Later, it is revealed that those other places DID literally make up their respondents and their data. Did our office receive an apology? Nope.)

Paychecks bounce again. Our entire office location independently contacts the Department of Labor. The caseworker comes in and takes statements from all of us. Nothing ever comes of this. Corporate knows we have made statements to the DoL, and somehow I felt like they used it as extra ammo when they felt the need to literally scream at us over the phone.

It is now a few months later, and I can no longer handle the stress of not being able to control whether or not we can meet the deadlines for these surveys. I give my boss, the manager, a full months notice (like she asked me to - ""You are the best assistant manager I have ever had, and I am going to need longer to find someone to replace you. You're so amazing."" she told me many times.)

A full month goes by and she has not been able to find a replacement. Those that got an interview didn't show up for it, or quit after the first day of training. She begs me to stay ""just on week-ends"". I don't know why I agreed, but I did. I don't know how I thought that would work out positively for anyone, but hey, it was a little more money and maybe the fewer days would be less stress.

But then another month went by. Another month of bounced paychecks. Things over the week-ends are insane. It seems like no surveys are being done during the week, because every new week-end, it's nearly the same quotas to meet, and no projects have changed phases. That means I have to cram in extra surveys and change phases 2 times during the week-end. (Each phase had a slightly different set of packaging for the products. Each time we changed phases we needed to take pictures of the set up posters and send them in for approval before we could run any surveys on them.)

And then another month almost went by. It was the week of Christmas - the busiest time for all retail, and I couldn't take it any more. I had been screamed at (literally yelled at over the phone) the previous week-end for not getting enough surveys done - something entirely out of my control. I come in to get my paycheck in the middle of the week- it's late, of course. DoL gives precisely zero fucks. - and the first thing my manager tells me is that the amount of crying I do at work on my lunch break is not normal and needs to stop. (I had independently come to that conclusion, which is the other reason why I came in instead of waiting until the week-end.) 

I then tell her that there was something else I wanted to talk to her about, and she said ""You're quitting?"" Teary eyed, I said, ""yes"" and set my key on the desk. She tells me ""that's just great. I can't believe you are doing this to me."" She has me go into her office so that I can sign papers saying I am quitting of my own volition. (In the past, employees quit and then tried to get unemployment.) While she searches for them, she berates me. She tells me that I ""know that I can't see my son that often any more, and that my cancer's coming back, and that if I work seven days a week again it really will come back."" She tells me that I ""would never make a good teacher, the way you cry all the time."" She tells me that she ""would hate it if I was her son's teacher because of the way you freak out over everything."" She lashes out at me with insults that strike at the thing I wanted to do, and continually blames me for doing this to her. After I had given a month's notice and stayed an extra two. She tells me I threw the key at her.

She gives up on finding the papers. I start sobbing uncontrollably the minute I leave the storefront.

Quitting that job was one of the best decisions I ever made. And it also taught me a lot of very valuable life lessons. One of which is that if your paychecks are bouncing, or late, you need to leave immediately, because it won't stop, and is liable to become worse. Another one was that the minute you are screamed at by a superior, you need to just walk out of there. I also learned that I never want to be the manager of anything ever."

skyfallen7,relationships,1389849281.0,"You're very likely not my ex, but there are many similarities, so here's my perspective.

I still think about my ex too, even though we ultimately weren't right for each other and he broke my heart. As others above said, 15 years is a really long time to be with someone. And if you were like my ex and I, we were everything to one another for almost half our lives. That's a lot of loss and it will take a lot of time to not think about our exes so much. Patience and not indulging in thoughts will help.

The other thing - and please understand I'm projecting here because of my own circumstances (I have severe PTSD, my ex believes I'm Borderline. He also could never fully decide if he wanted to marry me or have kids with me). But basically, part of it may be that you're haunted by your own wrong doing. She may have done terrible things to you and therefore it's great for you both you're no longer together. But if you spent 15 years with her and knew in your heart that you didn't want to marry her or have kids with her, that's a long time to lie to someone. Own up to your part in it. See your ex as a real person who was no worse or better than any other human being, just different and not suitable for you. Make amends with the universe in whatever form that may be.

If you go through my history, you may dismiss my reply, because of how angry I was at my ex and how much I grieved. But the truth is, I want him to be happy, just as I am now. I've found someone who is a much better match for me in temperament and who isn't affected by my strong emotions. I hope my ex finds love with someone who is more suitable for him - I just don't want to have anything to do with him ever again, because he pretended to be someone he never was.

And you're right - there isn't anything you can do to improve your exes life. But you can ensure you treat your new girlfriend with respect, dignity, kindness and honesty in ways you never did with your ex."

I knew they would after you wouldn't lie.""  Here it goes: the secrets that will save you money.  
  
  
Used cars:  
Small lots price cars higher than larger lots because they have to make little off a lot. Also, many of them refuse to make major repairs on cars they buy. They sell them as is, and lie about it. You won't ever hear what's wrong with it there. Steer clear of them.  
Big lots have better deals. Profit margins vary depending on demand.  Higher demand cars are harder to negotiate. They won't slash the margin much if they know it will sell fast.  
  
New cars:  
Best advice: you can always get a better deal.  It may not may not always be price but you can always get more from a deal. Try asking for better apr's or free oil changes for 2 years. Get creative, we do this for others!  
When they ask like ""how much are you looking to pay?"" Answer with a real amount. Don't act like ass and not answer. Realistically, everyone has a price they want to be at. By telling it, the salesman can point you in the right direction. Being an asshole period makes the process difficult. If you have a plan, tell them right away.  
Finally, you can always walk away. If you feel like something isn't right, your gut feeling is most likely right.  
Ohhh, one more thing.  Do internet research beforehand. Try imagining yourself driving that car everyday. Don't regret your decision. It will suck.

steve496,nfl,1389849344.0,"Other than QB, the offenses seem like kind of a wash; the lines are both outstanding, and while the AFC might have a narrow advantage at WR+TE, the NFC definitely has the better RBs.  So the difference on offense is basically (Hall of Famer and this year's MVP) Peyton Manning, vs (Pro Bowler) Russell Wilson.

Defensively, its a landslide to the NFC.  The (all all-pro) 49ers linebackers backed up by the (all all-pro) Seattle secondary would be simply brutal on opposing offenses.  There's only 3 players on the AFC who'd have a chance of seeing the field with the NFC's starters - Wilfork, Miller, and Talib.  Outside of that, I'm not sure who on the rest of the AFC roster could beat out the NFC's *second* team defense (which includes several pro bowlers in its own right).

Special Teams... both sides have good kickers and good return men; the NFC might garner a slight advantage on account of Andy Lee being awesome, but its pretty close, overall.

Hence: do you want Manning and a patchwork defense, or Russell Wilson and the best defense the league has ever seen?  It all comes down to the value of a QB... but I kind of lean towards taking the defense - not just because of the starters, but because of the depth.  The AFC has 2 great QBs, but there's not much you can do with that; the NFC will be rotating through Avril, Bennet, Brooks, and Smith (and probably some other people) at outside rusher and spelling Willis and Bowman with Wagner.  Everyone will be fresh all game, and that may well be the edge in a game like this.

The only reason I hesitate is because, as good as Harbaugh and Carroll are, Belichick is in a league of his own, and if there's anyone who can find a way to piece together an effective stop unit out of that patchwork of defensive players, its him.  So when you factor in coaches... I don't know.  I probably still take the NFC, but only by a razor-thin margin."

There's also a discernible difference between a wife and mother who is also your wife.

I come and help with dinner after the bath is done, and she quickly gives baby the last top up before her bed time. 

We then finish making dinner/eat and she will have some time to herself to go for a walk with the dog, while I clean up the dishes/kitchen. 

We usually have some time together to chill in the later part of the evening and on 3 of those nights I also get in a little gym while she covers for me. 

The important thing here is team work. 

Reverse the roles, if you had to look after kids all day, chances are you're going to be happy your partner is home, but less romantically and with feverish kissing than with a relieved smile because reinforcements have arrived. 

I honestly believe that in many cases the parent staying at home to look after kids has the harder job. AT least in my case - and that of my closer friends. 

We also have make sure neither of us leaves the house/goes to bed without a kiss, it's a small thing but it matters. 

In your situation, I'd be taking the lead and saying ""No problem babe, I'll get to that in a second, first things first"" Get a kiss, give her a hug and ask her how her day was. 

EDIT: Why is this still being downvoted? What am I missing here. I'm assuming its the parent at home has it harder comment that has got you some of you butt hurt? As I said, In MY case and from what I see around me, all people who work white collar jobs. "

terabyte06,NoStupidQuestions,1389849396.0,"Out of your monthly paycheck, yeah.  But you'll get it all back with your tax return.  

Say you filled out your W-4 as single, and your employer takes out $2000 total for the year.   When you file your return with 1 dependent listed, it'll tell you you only owe $1000, but you've already paid in $2000.  So you'll get that extra $1000 back.

If you had listed 1 dependent on your W-4, your employer would only take out $1000 over the course of the year.  When you file your taxes, you would break even (you owe $1000, and you've already paid $1000).  So you wouldn't get any back, but you wouldn't owe extra.  

That's the basics with made up numbers, anyway.  

One more example, if you had listed 2 dependents on your W-4, your employer would take out only $500.  But you when filed your taxes listing only 1 dependent, you'd owe in total $1000.  You've only paid in $500, so you'd have to send the IRS a check for the additional $500."

codeverity,AskReddit,1389849428.0,"Feminism as 'gender equality' is almost simplistic in a way, because it brings to mind simple things like wages when there is so much more tied into it. 

True feminism is about a shift in the way society as a whole works and the way we divide people up according to 'gender roles'. It means changing things so that women earn a fair wage and don't risk losing their jobs if they become pregnant, but it also means men being able to show emotion and stay home with their kids without it being commented on. It'll mean not associating little things like pink or blue with one gender or the other. 

Feminism does correlate to progress, for me. Sexism translates to women not being valued and in turns means that men are judged for any qualities that are deemed 'feminine', so it impacts everyone. 

I don't think that it's necessarily working the way that it's intended, however - for example many women who are not white do not feel included in the overall scope of 'feminism'. There are many feminists who are both consciously and unconsciously racist, homophobic and transphobic so there's a lot that we need to work on... But I think we're making progress all the time, especially more so in the last few years as social media has become more common. "

My first inclination was that it might be Grade B wildflower honey, but I found a picture of the packaging online, and according to the label it is indeed Grade A honey.

Since they describe the taste as ""hearty robust,"" it may include honey from low-demand sources that has a strong taste, or woodland honey that didn't come out tasting as sweet as the consumer expects. Good properties for a baking honey, where a mild honey like clover won't be much more noticeable among the spices than table sugar.

mundabit,Fibromyalgia,1389849724.0,"Originally I was told all my pains were just an expression of a General Anxiety disorder that I was diagnosed with at 9. I saw many psychiatrists and tried many anti-anxiety meds, they all made me feel relaxed, but none helped with my pain.

I was also put on amitriptyline, Fun story with that, My Original prescriber, a pelvic floor specialist gave me 6 months worth, I was instructed to ween off at the 4 month mark.

at 4 months, I double'e checked with my GP that I should ween, she said no. I asked for a repeat script in that case, she said no, So I explained to my original prescriber who said she wants me to follow the original plan, so I weened. Now my GP is refusing to see me because I ignored her advice by coming off the pills that I didn't have access to.

I have concluded based on how I felt before, and how I feel now, that amitriptyline did jack shit for my pain or anxiety.

I see a therapist to help manage my depression and anxiety, she has sent about 8 letters to  my GP and Rhematologist so far explaining that I am a pretty level-headed person considering the physical pain, she says she has seen nothing to suggest I suffer real depression or an anxiety disorder. She did conclude that I have PMDD, but stated that is dependent on my upcoming test for endo, as she says that if I have endo, then its only to be expected that I get depressed on my period.

I haven't noticed stress impacting my physical pain, I keep a pretty detailed diary to try and track patterns like that. I do think a therapist is a valuable member of my fibro-fighting team, she helps me keep it all together when I have 6 different specialists saying 6 different things, its stressful regardless of your personal anxiety issues."

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1389849760.0,"Nausicaa, from the manga series by Hayao Miyazaki called ""Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind"".  That series is basically his manifesto of political beliefs, and if you read it you will notice a lot of similar pacifist, environmentalist, and feminist themes that show up in many of his unrelated movies.  Nausicaa is absolutely my favorite, and it's drawn painstakingly beautifully.  The world he created is lush yet diseased, haunting and epic. 

Nausicaa, the character, is my favorite because she represents so much of who I wish I could be.  She's feminine, gentle, nurturing, understanding/compassionate, and yet she's not just a princess in a dress.  She rides the wind effortlessly, she knows how to pilot a jet, and is an expert swordfighter.  She's brave even when she's terrified, and will stand up for what is right in her heart...even if that is against the law, and against what people say she should think and feel.

oldmonty,lifehacks,1389849930.0,"Most pirated things are rips of other sources, Tv shows for example are direct captures from people with htpc's which are acting as dvr's. Movie rips are either done from the internet such as itunes or directly from a blu-ray disk. There is no way they could achieve better resolution or bitrate than the original source material. To do so would be irresponsible as it would increase the file size for no reason. 

The way I see it he paid for the right to see the content which he is not being allowed to do properly, it doesnt effect the payment situation where he sees the content, in fact it saves the person he is paying money because they are not using bandwidth to stream it to him. 

There are some features you could say he is getting extra, such as the fact that tv rips dont include commercials which you would have to watch if you were using your tv and didnt have a dvr. This is a fair point but doesnt apply to netflix which doesnt have any ads and anyone with an enhanced dvr which automatically cuts out ads which can be bought directly from the cable company. 

Then there's the whole thing about ownership of content, if I pirate it I own the content for free whereas if I'm streaming it I only own the right to watch the content while I keep paying for the streaming service. This is where the major philosophical debate comes in. Should I be able to own content permanently that I have only paid to watch? Does the mere fact that I *can* keep the content forever change things even if I'm just going to delete the file after watching it once anyway, i.e. the way netflix works except the local files are deleted automatically instead of needing to do so manually. Do my memories count as a form of hard-storage, where, because I can recall every detail its basically a reproduction and thus ownership of a copy of the original source.

I dont have all the answers here... All I can say is the way content ownership is done needs an overhaul, people have been engaging in various forms of piracy for as long as there has been digital content. 

I remember when I was a kid I would stick an audio cassette into the radio in order to record a song so I could play it back later. I didnt see this as piracy or stealing, it just made common sense, I'm listening to the song for free, if I want to listen to it again later why should I have to hope for it to randomly play again? The radio had the record function built into it for a reason right? 

If its to the point where 6-7-8 year old kids are doing it without thinking about it can you really call it such a huge crime? To someone who probably hasnt even jaywalked before this, probably felony, accusation is crazy. 

The way I see it, these days, as soon as you put something out there that is content, it is no longer yours, or at the very least you shouldnt expect it to be. It belongs to all the people who you have produced the content for, if you want to make money from it you have to embrace how things are changing instead of fighting petty battles in which you will end up nickle and diming yourself out of existence.

It's like teaching noobs in WoW how to do things. You can be perfectly happy playing on your own, but sometimes it's fun to play with others. It's less fun to play with others if they're having a terrible time (for me, at least). If you teach them, they will be able to teach those they play with, and those they play with, and so on. And even if they don't teach others, right here and now you will be playing with someone that can have fun because you helped them learn.

Or to use another analogy, it's like dancing. You can dance alone, you can dance with a partner, but if your partner steps on your feet and gets in the way of what you want to do you'll feel less like you're dancing the way you wanted to dance. If you teach them the dance you're doing, you can both perform it closer to the way you'd prefer.

Worrying about all of this will of course be stressful, so remember that others are teaching how to dance and trying to learn as well. If everyone wants to dance together, and is trying to learn, you might see it to be easier to help them learn instead of isolating yourself and complaining what terrible dancers they are. Helping them and helping yourself in this way leads to mutual gains.

Edit: And not to forget, teaching can be fun just to be teaching, interacting, and learning. Feeling like you've got things figured out enough to be helpful can be quite enjoyable, in comparison to being doubtful and constantly worrying that your way isn't good enough and that you're completely blind. Being confident in doing the action you want to do is really quite nice, like drifting along with a current you've created in a pool and enjoying the sunshine. The current is there, the sunshine is there, you want to float and move through the water, you aren't harming anyone by doing so, so you can relax and just do it. If they say they don't want to learn you can also just say ""ok"" and go on to do something else you'd like to do."
Cananbaum,AskReddit,1389850031.0,"There is a Mitsubishi dealer ship in the next town over and I was driving to work and I see this awful green *jelly bean* and I think to myself, ""What in the Hell is THAT?"" 

I go to take a look and it was a new Mirage. Dealer came out and said he was one of the first dealers to start selling them. 

It was a top of the line model, but for $15ooo... I can get a used Lexus for half as much and I told him that. 

I think however, one of two things will happen:

One - It will flop like the the iQ and Smart for 2; The only sales (if any) will be highly congested places like Boston or New York. Which if I was living in or remotely close to (or even *in*) one of those cities (O.K, 45 minutes from Boston, but most of New England's population lives in that one city if that can paint a picture) I'd honestly consider it. Plus, people are more conscientious with their money and like I said, buy a better used car for half as much.  

Or Two: The Mirage has a few things going for it than the two cars: It may have relatively the same performance and fuel economy, but it is more practical with it's space and has a broader price range which is important. - But because it has a few legs up on the other micro cars, it has a chance to become really popular in urban environments.

Life-in-Death,vegan,1389850253.0,"Flax is a form of fat called ALA.  Algae provides DHA, the one we need.  As far as I know neither directly provide EPA.

Anyway, I take both.  The conversion from ALA to DHA is fairly low in your body, but the great thing about flax is that it can be stored in your tissues and your body can convert as needed, always providing a ""fresh"" supply of DHA (and I think EPA, I am too lazy to look right now).

There is some amount of time after which you would only need flax because you have built up enough of a reserve in your system for an adequate conversion.

But one of the biggest things you want to do is lower your Omega-6s.  That means most of your vegetable oils: corn, soy, safflower, canola (though fairly high in O3).  Olive oil is an O9 so it is considered fine."

I looked through a lot of it and threw away probably 85% of it. I have everything I wrote on a computer still on my iMac right now (starting with 6th grade). And a lot of the rest of the bulk was xeroxed handouts and etc.

Things I did keep, though, were essays with good comments by my teachers. That you can't replicate. Some comments were good, some were scathing. Some in a row from the same teacher.

And as I'm older and will likely never have a presidential library (I'm nearly old enough to run for President), I'm more willing to part with stuff that happened so long ago.

I did want to keep my early childhood stuff which is more drawings and whimsical silly stories with spelling errors.

And my mom is donating about 40 pounds of legos to what we think is a good recipient of it.

But does it ever come in handy to work? Even my college stuff, I would say no. Far better resources online than those old papers."

Relevant part from the literature examples of said page:

&gt;J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye started a Angst revolution in literature that it's never come out of. Angst has been a part of literature ever since Wuthering Heights, Romeo and Juliet, and even The Iliad (Achilles sitting in his tent sulking, anyone?), but there it was presented in such eloquent language that it seemed more legitimately emotional. As a result, those who've read similar-style books before reading Salinger's book often write Catcher off as okay at best, and a poor man's Chuck Palahniuk at worst. 

&gt;The use of a casual, first-person writing style also contributes heavily to making it dated. The use of slang and turns of phrase that are alien to newcomers makes it strange to a modern reader. On top of that, almost everybody admonishes Holden not to swear when the worst thing he says is... ""goddamn"". This leads to modern readers, who hear words like ""fuck"" and ""shit"" on a daily basis, seeing Holden as more of a Rule-Abiding Rebel when he was, for his time, quite a potty-mouth.

&gt;This is parodied in the South Park episode ""The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs"", where the kids are required to read The Catcher in the Rye for school and are disappointed by how tame they find it to be after hearing so much about how controversial it was. Cartman even says that the book was a conspiracy to get kids to read by making it seem a lot edgier than it was.

&gt;You could argue that not only was Salinger groundbreaking, he was also way, way ahead of his time. The sarcastic first-person narrator he pioneered has become so popular in fictional media involving teenagers that people tend to forget it only really took off as recently as The Nineties. John Hughes could use it in Ferris Bueller's Day Off three-and-a-half decades after Catcher in the Rye was published and still make it seem original; even Clueless, which was nearly a decade after that, seemed fresh at the time."

svaachkuet,racism,1389850586.0,"[Sociolinguists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociolinguistics) know that linguistic behaviors have more to do with the social context a person lives or has lived in rather than their phenotypical characteristics. At birth, the brain, which holds language, is not even sufficiently developed to support language, and infants must take in social experiences, including those of a linguistic nature, in order to develop an internal grammar of the language(s) that they are acquiring. During your formative years, your language behaviors continue to change, and some of this is unintentional (adolescent boys' voices crack because their vocal tracts are lengthening) and some of this is intentional (subtracting out vocal-tract lengthening, young men in the US often try to speak with an even deeper voice that they used to when they were young because they perceive a deep voice as more ""masculine""-sounding). So, if you grew up with a need to present yourself as a member of racial group X, and that group is strongly associated with a particular sociolect (=way of speaking by a particular social group), such as African-American English, Chicano English, etc., then your speech is likely to exhibit characteristics of that sociolect. However, this isn't always a sure thing. For one, race isn't exactly categorical, as there are plenty of mixed race/multiracial individuals who speak only one sociolect. Additionally, an individual's racial identity (as perceived by themselves or by others) needn't match their presumed speech behaviors, e.g. you can be white and still speak a variety of African-American English, and you can be black and only speech an American English dialect that is strongly associated with white speakers. Lastly, a person will vary in their own speech behaviors all the time.

I, for example, am Chinese-American (of 100% Chinese ancestry). Both of my parents decided early on to speak to me only in English, and I'm a native speaker of just English. I learned most of my standard American English in school, and I sound like any other native speaker of American English who grew up in California. My speech patterns have little to do with my genetic background and more to do with the social context I grew up in, that is, having a rather negative evaluation of my parent's Cantonese-accented English while growing up, experiencing a lot of assimilation pressure to ""speak like an American"" from my teachers, peers, and US media, going to school in a wealthy, 90% white suburb, not interacting with an alternate speech community besides mainstream white America to identify with, entering higher education and academia, where the vast majority of people are speakers of educated, ""standard"" American English (I put ""standard"" in quotes, because [standard languages don't actually exist](http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~papke/downloads/lg_1997_ch3.pdf)). All of these contextual factors have influenced how I speak today more than any factor that is attributable merely to my ethnicity. To focus on my race would just be ignoring the more important factors that influence the observable components of spoken language. I know this because I'm a phonetician, and, although we use some pretty hard-core technology to capture and analyze speech, we cannot find anything in speech that directly contains race-related information. And the audio signal from a phone could be even more heavily degraded than speech heard in its real environment.

Sociolinguists also research how people perceive race in language, but this always comes with the underlying knowledge that **race actually provides no basis for linguistic behavior**. The exact labels for race that people use when talking about language have more to do with their linguistic attitudes toward race in their society (e.g. in the US, ""black people talk like this"", ""Asian people talk like that"") than authentic understandings about how all members of an entire racial group talk. Racial categories are constructed socially rather than biologically, and people assign individuals to them using their own beliefs about race; however, these categories rarely line up with real physical taxonomies. So I believe that this is the danger of your initial question about ""determining race from speech""."

Considering your dismissal of my post as uninformed, I decided to read the source material for some better insight, as your reply did not provide any.

Having now read the source material I stand by my original assertion: it's a crock of shit.

I will grant Tegmark his due, in that he does a lot to explore the implications of the Integrated Information Theory, however he does nothing to defend this original premise. He even states as much in his conclusion:

""We have focused not on solving this problem, but rather on exploring the implications of this view-point.""

The original premise here is what does not hold up, not the implications of it. Redefining perception and consciousness as effectively interaction and processing, generalizes the concepts to the point of meaninglessness. There's no distinction here between frontal cortex function, lambda calculus, and a pile of rocks. That information is present in everything in no way implies that consciousness is as well."

Lokikong,conspiracy,1389851012.0,"It is the type of radiation but it is also a constant pump you see. The currents take the 300 tons of radiation and then grabs the next days. But you see this adds up with tidal pools and other heating and cooling with currents. And as it makes its way through the oceans it will build up wherever it can land, like in the fish or in the ocean floor. Other organic life too. As more is pumped more accumulates. You can find lots of reports on how the sea life and on land plant life is doing. There is at least one report about how the sea floor around japan is almost completely dead sea life. 90% or so. Now see this same principal applies to the west coast as well as the air currents. The reason there has been a huge surge in people who are claiming that fukushima hit the west coast is because a lot of us were following fukushima since it started. At least a year back there was a physicist who calculated when the 1st wave would arrive at the west coast around now. And it just so happens that a local tester of the west coast for radiation reports received higher radiation readings recently. 
It caught the attention of the government and they too confirmed higher radiation but claim it is safe. Also there was a discovery channel youtube video that came out today where a guy admits some areas had 7x normal radiation but it was ok?

obsidianechoes,3Dprinting,1389851031.0,"Have these 6 different filaments been different colors?  Though you've used two different suppliers, do the vacuum-packed spools look the same when you receive them?  This could be a long shot but even though I've used multiple suppliers, I've received spools that clearly came from the same manufacturer (cheap, Chinese).  They all had a white sticker on the side about an inch across with English and Chinese characters and a long number (what I assume was a batch number).

In my case, it was black ABS causing the exact same issues you're noticing.  Changing temperatures did nothing, buying a new hot-end did nothing, troubleshooting with my printer manufacturer for 3 weeks did nothing.  In the end, it came down to the fact that this cheap filament had lots of fillers and dyes that were screwing up the extrusion and increasing back pressure in the barrel until the filament stripped.  It would get worse on the first layer with the added back-pressure caused by the nozzle's proximity to the bed.  I even did the ""push the filament through by hand test"" and this filament would extrude, albeit a bit slowly, and I had to give it a bit of force.  (For reference, higher-quality filament at the same temperature would extrude like butter -- very smoothly.)

To ""fix"" this issue, I thought I'd use a completely different supplier from the other side of the country.  But when I received 3 new spools, they ALL shared the same manufacturer sticker as my original, problematic filament (and displayed the same extrusion problems).  I tried a third supplier that also shipped the same Chinese filament but this time white instead of black.  The problem largely disappeared though even this filament would clog occasionally.  I've tried 3 hot-ends and am now using an E3D which is great but the only thing that made the difference was switching to a spool of higher-quality filament, (no longer off-brand Chinese filament).

The strangest part of all of this was just how intermittent the problem was.  I remember I made it through an entire roll of black ABS before any problems arose.  And sometimes I could get a print to complete successfully and sometimes, not at all.  I spent months fighting this issue and I still don't know if I have the answer except to say that higher-quality filament did it for me.

I know you're printing PLA so not exactly the same scenario but I figured my situation was worth mentioning.  Both can have fillers and dyes."
kromagnon,WritingPrompts,1389851036.0,"The man stood silently in the nothingness, looking forward at the blinding light before him. He had stood here before, tens of thousands of times. It was only here in the chasm between worlds that he felt whole, a fleeting moment of clarity as he rose from the murky, disorienting waters of life to take a breath. He closed his eyes, but it didn't matter. The light poured into his vision just as clearly as if his eyes were open. His physical representation was purely ornamental in this place. He lowered himself slowly and sat. He meditated.  

Collecting his thoughts, he ruminated on the choices he had made over his many lifetimes. There is no telling how long he meditated, time has no meaning in this place. Two emotions began to overpower everything else in his mind. Love and sorrow. He realized he had a deep affection for every person, every life. Even the most vile atrocities that they committed could not sway his endearment. He himself had committed many of them. That is where the sorrow came from. Not only from his own regret, but from the understanding that the pain was inevitable.  

""Free will is an illusion."" he said to no-one, and himself. Even in this place, this world outside of space and time and matter, he realized that he was always destined to end up here. It was all so clear. Every life he had lived was a product of the brain he was given, and the environment he was placed in. Recalling a memory from when he was a murderer, he remembered such anger, such hatred. His brain worked differently then. The murderer had a different understanding of right and wrong. The man still felt love for this criminal. He empathized with his plight, because it was his own. Evil wasn't a product of bad men. ""Evil"" was the set of circumstances that produced these tragically malformed people.

At the same time, he understood that the great deeds and sacrifices he had made in past lives were also destined. He had given food to the starving and shelter to the homeless, all because during his life he had been compelled to. It wasn't his choice to be driven to care for people, it was just how he had been born.  

Men were no more deserving of his love than of his rebuke.  And yet he loved them anyway. His loved stemmed from understanding. He understood utterly. The mystery of life is that it simply *is*. The man stood, and waved away the light. He was finally complete.

Right so [rotator cuff conditioning exercises](http://youtu.be/NsZRMixHpsI) are a great thing to do as those four little muscles are the most susceptible to injury. Aside from that, push-ups and pull-ups are good conditioning for the more major muscles. 

Proper form is oh so important. Engaging the shoulders through moves is something I really emphasize with my students. Always remember that you're holding yourself up with that shoulder, not hanging from it. Hold your shoulder blades flat against your back, placing your shoulders down and slightly back. Always make sure your shoulders are thoroughly warmed up before bearing weight on them and cool-down stretches after poling help to keep your shoulder joints loose and flexible. Inflexible shoulders are more susceptible to injury as well.

Sooo TL;DR: Shoulder conditioning exercises, especially rotator cuffs. Proper form and engaging the shoulders through moves. Thorough warm-up and cool-down stretches."

If you want to apply new paste, go for it if you feel comfortable doing so. Honestly, the numbers you are getting are well within normal operating temperatures and you shouldn't be concerned. Under load, your MacBook Pro will get hot no matter what. 105c is not that bad. 

However, the cooler you can get an Intel CPU to be, the faster it will run. Let's say your CPU is a 3.0 GHz i7. Once it hits a high enough temp attire it will clock itself down to (lets just say) 2.5GHz. I mean, first it will try and cool itself by revving up the fans to max rpm, but if that doesn't help it will run at a slower speed. So if performance is your goal, you should change your paste, get a notebook cooling fan stand/pad/thingy, as well as continue to use iStat to force your fans in a full speed. This will give you the best performance as possible."

These are things that can still be avoided from a man's perspective, so typical use pregnancy rates are misleading when it comes to a man's ability to practice safe sex - if the man is actually trying (e.g., never forgets or neglects to use a condom, follows printed instructions, avoids risk of breakage), the probability of pregnancy is much lower.

Either way, I might genuinely be able to entertain the idea of rights when it comes to a situation where it's objectively proven that a man did everything he could to practice safe sex and use proper contraception, but a pregnancy still resulted (at least, ignoring the bodily autonomy concern I posted earlier), but those are such a small minority of cases that it really feels like derailing when people bring up the ""injustice"" done to men by advocating for a woman-first mindset of reproductive choice. "
undergroundmonorail,learnpython,1389851389.0,"    five = cost * 0.05
    ten = cost * 0.10
    fifteen = cost * 0.15

    print ""5% is $"" + str(int(five))

    print ""15% is $"" + str(int(fifteen))
    print ""20% is $"" + str(int(twenty))
    print ""25% is $"" + str(int(twentyfive))

I'd have done this like so:

    for i in xrange(5, 30, 5):
        print ""{}% is ${:.2f}"".format(i, int(cost*(i/float(100))))

This creates a generator that will spit out `5`, `10`, `15`, `20`, `25`. Then for each of those numbers, it will print [that number]`% is $`[result of relevant calculation]. This saves declaring the variables `five`, `ten`, `fifteen`... as well as reducing the number of redundant print statements and making for cleaner code. In general, when you find yourself repeating more than a line or so of code, you should try to see if you can find a way to make it a bit nicer.

Another small improvement I'd make is reworking the input. Right now, you can replace your declarations of `cost` with

    cost = float(raw_input(""Cost of Meal 'Minus the $ symbol': ""))

to achieve exactly what you're doing right now, but that's still not ideal. What I'd probably do is something like this:

    # note that I just came up with this off the top of my head, I don't know that
    # it's good practice or anything
    
    while True:
        try:
            cost = float(raw_input('blahblahblah'))
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass

This would start an infinite loop, then ask the user for the cost. If that worked, it would break out of the loop. Otherwise, it would try again. This is preferable to the way your program handles it, which is ""crash"".

I know I sort of just tore apart your whole program except the print statements at the top and the exit prompt, but truth be told this is a very well done first project. :)"

Here is a story, for your trouble.  I recently moved from VA to NY.  As we were leaving Virginia we stopped at a gas station for gas and breakfast.  It was one of those that has a sandwich counter, so I was browsing sandwich while my mom (who was helping me move) went to look at drinks.  As I stood there, an old man come in.  He was small, shorter than me, and I'm 5'2"".  He smiled, and he walked right up to me, and he said ""You recognize me from the TV, don't you?""  And he seemed a little creepy, but I was too baffled to walk away just then, so he continued.  ""I'm Jeff Lange, the Olympic wrestler.""  He clearly expected me to be impressed.  Then he asked me where I went to high school (I look very young for my age).  So I lied and told him a school near mine.  His reply was ""I thought you looked familiar!""  By this time I was pretty sure he was either completely crazy or an old pervert trolling for high school booty, so I backed off.  He scowled and for a moment I thought he might to chase me, but about that time my mother reappeared at the sandwich counter, and, seeing I was not alone, Jeff Lange the Olympic Wrestler fled the scene.

Later, I googled Jeff Lange (several spellings), and have not yet been able to find anything about his Olympic wrestling career.  "

People talk about how good it was until the ending and it really wasn't. The gameplay was tight. The controls were awesome. And the combat was really fun. But almost everything else was terrible. 

Except for everything having anything to do with Mordin, the game took a gigantic step backwards. 

Great writers left, and were replaced with not-so-great writers. So story suffered heavily, dialogue suffered heavily, and characters suffered heavily. 

Then design opened up to be less about ""the boring stuff"" (aka everything people loved about ME1), and more about shooting stuff with my gunz.

TheMarkHasBeenMade,nursing,1389851858.0,"We've got an IV specialist team that's full of wonderfully peppy and helpful nurses, we're very lucky. I would stay with my patients when they would work to pick up pointers. 

When you're working with veins that roll easily, have the patient make a light fist and extend his arm. This helps to stabilize the vein.  

Use heat packs for a few minutes before you try anything, this'll bring the veins closer to the surface of the skin for easier attempts. 

Practice makes perfect. Drawing labs will get you used to finding veins and give you confidence in your sticks and techniques, too, so don't turn down doing a lab unless you really don't have the time. Getting an IV in a tough stick is worth the time you put into practicing!"

BooksofMagic,relationships,1389852217.0,"&gt; Firstly, can I just say a huge thank you for approaching this in such a polite and agreeable manner? I've never come across it in any advocate of /r/TheRedPill previously and I appreciate being able to speak to someone without them calling me names or decrying my beliefs. 

Your welcome.  You have treated me with respect and I find no reason to respond with hate.  I actually find healthy discussions of this sort really can really help a person understand fresh ideas more completely.  OF course, I may just be so agreeable because I am still relatively new, and the bigotry and misogyny are soon to set in...  ;p

&gt;&gt; I believe that despite the way it went down you are now both better off having finally gotten it out in the open and dealt with it.
&gt;
&gt;Absolutely! It hurt like all hell when our friendship disintegrated, but he showed his true colours and I'm better off without him in my life. He's also likely better off as he no longer has to deal with being in my presence platonically when he clearly desired more than that. If he weren't such a raving, sexist creep, I'd sympathise with him a lot more. Unrequited attraction isn't something I'd wish on anyone.

TBH, Considering how long you knew him, I actually find it hard to believe that you didn't suspect anything about his feelings for you prior to him blowing up.  And that being the case, you need to shoulder some responsibility for what happened too.  You could have easily refused to be friends with him, but you chose not to.

&gt;Many feminists believe that so-called 'friendzoning' and the fallout afterwards occurs because some men perceive women as sex objects and can't overcome this in a platonic context. They believe friendships to be transactional e.g. ""if I'm nice to her, she'll put out"", ""if I buy her this, she'll have to give me a blow job"". 

I hate to break it to your friends, but the vast majority of men want sex.  Lots of it.  Any man who says otherwise either has 1) a low sex drive 2) is lying to themselves 3) is lying to you.  Now that isn't to say that our brains are helpless to our primal instincts (indeed we have more control than any species on the planet) but the effects of hormones (ie. DRUGS) on our bodies are undeniable.  Men can't help the fact they have so much testosterone in their bodies in the same manner that women can't help feeling the effects of the hormones released during their menstrual cycles.  The best thing we can do to control it is to be aware of the realities so that we can manage them better.

*edit:  To expand on this a bit,  It is a misinterpretation that these men are seeking only sex in relationships with women.  Men and women show/receive love differently and for a man, having sex IS showing his love.  And their may be biological reasons for this as male sperm has been shown to have chemicals in it that act as anti-depressants as well as other chemicals that scientist assume assist with a couple bonding together.  Fascinating stuff really*

also wanted to add:

&gt;They believe friendships to be transactional e.g. ""if I'm nice to her, she'll put out"", ""if I buy her this, she'll have to give me a blow job"". 

*This is incorrect.  These men don't actually think this way.  These men simply don't know how to persue a woman.  They keep waiting for the part in the movie where the the attractive female friend they hung out with finally sees them as worthy of dating material, allows him to sweep them off their feet and ride off into the sunset.  The negative reactions happen when they finally give up this dream, which causes them spill over with resentment and bitterness.*

Noneerror,raisedbynarcissists,1389852304.0,"It could get OP's brother kicked out, or it could get OP's father sent to prison. Theft of $1200 is grand theft in [most states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_theft#Grand_theft_by_state). It probably wasn't theft in the criminal sense, but if it was it, it was *serious*. Best to ask for local legal advice as many others have said. A local kids help hotline is a good place to *start*. A conversation with a police officer is free and often more relevant than a conversation with a lawyer. After all if it's illegal but the police decide they don't act in __ situation then it doesn't matter that it's illegal. Tons of domestic situations are straight up illegal but nothing happens because the police decide they don't want to deal with it even if the victim does.

Additionally if he doesn't declare it on his income (which they never do) he's committing a crime at a later date when he files his taxes. So while it could get OP's brother kicked out it could also be a substantial bargaining chip too. My point is when ""shit really goes down"" its important to know all the power angles if there's a next time... and he did it once already, there will be a next time too.

Reyalla508,poledancing,1389852453.0,"I agree with this, the back of the arm should be unnecessary. With regards to that side grip, I call that the 'pocket' (term used by Pantera Blacksmith and I took it). It's the area between the top of the pelvis and the lower ribs. That's where the grip should be. Too often I see people in inside and outside leg hangs that are too vertical with the grip in their upper ribs (which means behind the arm too). Bone + pole = bad, so this grip configuration is incorrect. 

As much as it hurts, making sure you're squeezing and engaging to grip versus allowing yourself to sort of hang from your skin. If you just suck it up and do it it'll get easier a lot faster. ;)"

lendrick,JRPG,1389852659.0,"I think people need to realize something about entertainment companies, particularly video game studios: For the most part now, if you follow a video game series, what you're following is a bunch of lawyers and MBAs who own a name.  The people who gave your game series its soul and made it so great back at the beginning are long since gone.  When the culture of their company changed from being about making great games to being about monetizing everything as much as possible, they walked.

Generally, what happens is that the MBAs will get into management positions and decide to ""monetize"" as much as possible.  For a year or two, this works great.  The company has the trust of its fans, so when it puts out a couple of crappy titles, people pay for them, get a sub-par product, and assume it was a fluke.  Meanwhile, the company is rolling in dough, because they've just put out a low quality product and made a lot of money on it, so clearly that means the MBA's decision was the right one.

But now a few more years pass, and the company keeps putting out crappy titles.  They've now burned through that trust that the company earned over the past decade by not sucking ass.  Profits start to drop.  Of course, rather than examining what it is that has caused their fans to stop trusting them, they look in the recent past, decide that monetizing was good, and reach the conclusion that they have to monetize *harder*.  Meanwhile, the original developers who made the games great in the first place have long since retired or moved on to other companies.  

This happens with every publisher EA and Activision buy, it happened to Squaresoft, and in the tabletop arena it happened to Wizards of the Coast when they got bought out by Hasbro.  I'm sure there are plenty of other examples as well.  Generally speaking, though, when a good company gets bought out, it's probably going to to go shit.


Copyright is kind of a fucked up system in this regard.  Often times, the copyrights on a franchise end up being owned by the people least able to respect the franchise properly.  The writers and developers who made the original franchise what it was are swept away.

The moral of the story is this:  Find out who developed the games that you loved, and find out where they are now.  The developers are the people you want to follow, not the MBAs who own the name of the series you like.

Life-in-Death,Feminism,1389852702.0,"&gt;liking to look at sexualized images of women

&gt;when men sexualize women, 

I think the point is in the difference between those two statements.  Sure, men like to look at women being sexual.  

But when men *sexualize* women, as in a verb, that is when the problem starts and power comes in.  

If a girl send a boy pictures of herself.  Great, and vis versa.  But when men sexualize a woman that has to do will a man's need to have a woman be a sexualized being, and no more.  That is commenting on a woman's body.  That is only writing roles in which woman are sexual creatures.  That is when men call women ""sluts"" as a general insult.  That is when say men say (as apparently they did with the Golden Globes) there was too much estrogen, as the women were not sexualized.  That is like Terry Richardson virtually only taking sexualized photos of women, but not of men.

Liking women sexually is great.  But only letting them to exist as such is a form of power."

Really? 0.65 extra regen is nice? I'd rather get Arcane Boots with its extra mana and the active that helps my entire team.

Phase maybe. Treads, absolutely not, they're slower then Arcane and like I said: the Arcane active is better for my team.

There aren't any real mana issues and I go runes anyway. Getting bottle just puts me 650 gold further away from Arcane, which I can get pretty early on in the match.

That's taking a big chance. It's a mini-stun, sure, but it's in no way certain you're going to land one in time.

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1389853180.0,"&gt;I feel like I'm ready to commit to the faith. 

Awesome! 

I personally think it's really smart for you to turn to your community as you embark on this journey. Judaism isn't meant to be done in solitude.

First I think you need to pick a goal or two to work on at the beginning. It can be something that you used to do and really enjoyed, or something that you haven't done before but want to try. Then set a frequency for it/them. ""I want to go to Friday night services twice a month."" ""I want to pray the Shema at bedtime every night."" Something like that. That gives you some concrete steps to work on and is easier to deal with then ""want to rejoin my spiritual community"" which probably seems overwhelming.

&gt;And I really liked the Rabbi. 

Reach out to him/her before you go. Even if it's just a short email saying ""hey, remember me? coming back soon. wanted to say hi."" Email them any questions you may have, or set up an appointment with them by calling the synagogue office.

&gt;I'm fifteen in case that'll help as well.

Is their a youth group at your synagogue? See if your parents will let you join.

Also, I see you're Reconstructionist/Renewal. Do you know what prayerbook your community uses? I have a copy of the Reconstructionist siddurim that are just sitting on my bookshelf collecting dust. If you want them, I'm happy to ship them to you. I'd only do this if you and your parents were comfortable with it though.

Slukaj,videos,1389853208.0,"It's a pretty straightforward physics problem. The faster you accelerate, the stronger the forces are that act on the object/body. If you can accelerate over a longer period of time, you reduce the forces and stresses the body receives.

When a classic car, built from steel, hits an object, it accelerates (slows down) the instant it hits. Because steel is so hard, it accelerates to zero nearly instantaneously, which results in some absurd forces being exerted on the body.

When a modern car, also built from steel but also built with ""crumple zones"" hits an object, the crumple zones of the vehicle are crushed as the car hits. This crushing allows for a longer period of time which the car is accelerating, which means weaker forces being exerted on the body.

The key piece of information here is the force = mass * acceleration equation. Let's say we've got a one ton (2,000lb or 907kg) car and it hits an object at 35mph (15.65m/s). 

* Let's assume that a car without crumple zones will have an acceleration of 35mph to 0mph in 1/10th of a second (156.65ms^2).

* Let's assume that a car with a crumple zone will have an acceleration of 35mp to 0mph in 5/10ths of a second (31.29ms^2).

So, knowing that F=mA, we can do a little math. 

* The car without a crumple zone will experience an impact force of 142,110.53 newtons (14,501 G's).

* The car with a crumple zone will experience an impact force of 28,385.82 newtons (2,896 G's). 

Having the crumple zone reduced the total impacting force by nearly 80% solely by increasing the amount of time the car is accelerating by 4/10ths of a second. 

All because the modern car has areas of the frame that are designed to crumple and absorb the impact. Think of it as a steel pillow."

antihero510,Coachella,1389853220.0,"Dude, please don't take it for the first time at a music festival surrounded by a ton of people.  Take it for the first time in a safe environment out in nature (go camping or on a hike or something) with a friend or two who you trust.  Familiarize yourself with its power in a safe environment first, and then once you understand it and are confident with it take it at the festival.  I can assure you that it will be no less special having your Coachella trip be your second trip.

Also, don't just see where the vibes take you.  Know how much you are going to take, and how you are going to dose yourself, before you start tripping.  That shit can take a long time to kick in and I've seen multiple people dose themselves again too soon and then trip the fuck out (in a bad way).

Lastly, have a xanax in your pocket.  That shit is the emergency stop button and WILL stop a bad trip/any anxiety within minutes if you need to take it.  However, know that if you take the xanax, the acid will basically go away so it's kinda a waste of acid, but it's much better to come back to reality and waste the acid than have a bad trip.

I was so angry and hurt I threw a pebble and said I ""I swear on my holy grave, I'm going to kill you!"" So despite having a severe black eye, bruises all over from being kicked and punched, I was the one suspended the last two days of school for a threat. 

The next year I would get jumped again, this time my wrist would be severely sprained. MY parents had one car so I had to wait in agony for about an hour for my mother and my aunt to show up to take me to the ER. The schools (honest to God) response as to why they couldn't look into the matter was because, ""...his arm wasn't broken."" However, out of a fit of desperation to get the kid to stop beating on me I threw a fist full of sand at him. My mother ended up threatening the principle's job because I was facing suspension with the possibility of expulsion for ""Trying to severely maim another student."" They thought I was trying to blind the kid.  

At that same school the gym coach would never help me out. I was constantly harassed (more or less sexually) by other boys; they would grab my ass, abscond with my clothes, constantly ask for blow jobs, call me a corn holer... it was bad. I one day screamed at the coach to please put an end to it all. He told me to ""Shut the Hell up, sit my ass down, and stop bitching."" I flipped him off and I got detention. (After that I was always getting detention for his class just so I could stay out of P.E.) - Yeah my parents got a call after I flipped him off saying that I verbally attacked him ""Out of the blue."" (They knew it wasn't true) 

I had one kid trip me as I got off the bus once, but I was friends with the bus driver and she had him black listed for the remainder of the year - which got me trouble from his friends. 

When I was in the 5th grade there was a plot by other 5th graders to set me on fire... I posted that on another thread. 

I in 2nd grade had a teacher that was sexist towards boys, and the school caught wind after I raised a stink, then my parents raised a stink - it turned out there were only 3 boys in her class, myself including, and none of us had passing grades. 

I had one teacher who forced me to use an alphasmart and computers instead of finding me help for my handwriting - THAT was embarrassing.... and because of that I got put into a special education department for a spell. Yeah, I'm not special needs, just had bad handwriting.

One thing I realised when I was young and recently rediscovered, is that if you're worrying about something, it's always better to find out for sure. I can see you're trying to do that, which is cool, but this is quite indirect and often won't help with a specific situation.

You need to find out from the source.

So instead of wondering ""what **should** I be doing in this situation"" start thinking ""what do I **want** to do right now"". If you fancy saying hello to everyone one morning, just do it, see what happens. If something really bad happens (though what bad can happen from saying hello? really?) then don't do it again. Same with talking to the guy next door, if ya want to talk, then talk. If he's busy then he'll tell you, simple as that. Also remember to treat each person as an individual, what goes for one doesn't necessarily go for the others, so go find out what does! Be proactive in trying to talk to people and instead of worrying about the expectations, you can learn them through experience and experimentation. You can even treat it like a game if you want to, I know I've done that before.

If you want a solid idea of whether something is going too far then think about if the positions were reversed. If someone came up to you and did what you're thinking of doing, how would you feel? I bet most of the time you would be either pleasantly surprised or not even notice the effort. Trust me that in these situations as long as *you* think it's ok, it will be fine. But if you start doubting whether something is acceptable even if you think it is. If you feel that anxiety coming on just keep in mind that you don't know till you try, so you might as well give it a try.

It definitely can't be worse than spending so much time agonising over it, right?"

The words are synonymous for the most part and can be used interchangeably. The differences lie in perception. An ""artist"" may view themselves as personal whereas a ""designer"" may view themselves as commercial.

Diving deeper, an ""artist"" will usually create art for art's sake. Whereas a ""designer"" will usually be employed by another person to do work that will generate revenue indirectly for a business. 

However, truly, an artist will design their work while a designer can be considered an artist so it's really based on how the individual perceives themselves."

non-troll_account,DebateReligion,1389853636.0,"Thanks. The Emergent church has it rough. Mostly because, as far as I can see, it's a catch-all term for Christians who have emerged out of Conservative Christianity, and at the same time cannot be liberal Christians. 

You'd have to understand the history of the American Church and American Culture for the last 165 years in order to really be able to clearly see what the Emergent Church is and is doing and going through. Think of it as Neo-Orthodoxy which has been appropriated by cultural Postmoderns. Think Karl Barth meets Michel Foucault meets Seth Macfarlane. Or Dietrich Bonhoeffer meets Jacques Derrida meets Malcolm Wilkerson (just Google it). 

It's a strange hodgepodge, that was just finding its stride, figuring out a new way of fitting with the changing world when suddenly, Internet. 

Emergent Christianity is characterized by self-awareness within our culture, and right now, the internet is changing culture so fast that it's Having a hard time. Conservative Christianity isn't bothered much by the current change; they've perfected the art of resisting change while ignoring the the actual changes that they've really made (40 years ago, Evangelicals argued that abortion was acceptable). Liberals are doing fine because they just stick to the old, ""progress"" line, reacting to culture in pretty much the same ways as always as well. Emergents though, have no insitutions to protect them from the cultural storm that the internet (and associated technologies) are causing. 

Think of it like this. 

Everybody's in a room playing music. Modernism, with its liberal secularism, comes along playing a different rhythm. Conservatives don't like this, and start playing their own melodies louder to counter it, while Liberals basically just start playing along with the new sound. Emergents are mostly Conservatives (and sometimes Liberals), who have stood up and gone, 

""hold on a tic, now, you're right, there are serious problems with this new music, but it's not all bad, and there's a lot of Good in it. And LOOK! You're now tapping your own feet to it, and your own music has changed to fit it too!"" 

And then, try to figure out what music they ought to play, and/or dance to dance. The old music has a rhythm and melody in it that they are convinced is still worth singing, but so has the new, changing melody and rhythm of modern society. And equally important, both songs have serious problems that they want to stop. And then, you realize that even through all this listening, you yourself never stop playing/dancing, nor being influenced by the music around you. 

And then the bass drops. Or, the super loud, hyperfast synthesizer kicks in, pick your metaphor. While the Emergent community is learning play at this new speed and rate of change brought on by modernity, everything suddenly has changed (is changing) AGAIN. 

The Emergent Community is nearly as fractured as the rest of American Culture. But it knows it. We're working on helping fix things, including ourselves. I've considered starting a blog about all this, but i'd probably get depressed at how inconsequential it would be."

From Celestial Divination in Ugarit and Ancient Israel: A Reassessment by Jeffrey L Cooley (Prof at Boston College) Published 2012.

&gt;  	
Iron Age Israel had a tradition of astral religion which was part of its ancient roots in the Levant. Astral religion was like other ancient Canaanite traditions which the biblical authors dismissed and derided as foreign. In spite of the antiquity of astral religion in ancient Israel, celestial divination was not part of Israel’s religious tradition. Material from Ugarit shows that any celestial divination in Syro-Palestine in the Bronze Age was immature speculation, while the biblical text provides evidence only for foreign practice. After the Iron Age, Jews engaged in forms of astrology, which were fundamentally Jewish adaptations of Late Babylonian or Hellenistic practice and show no Israelite or Neo-Babylonian or Neo-Assyrian legacy. Any form of celestial divination appears first in the Hellenistic period, when Late-Babylonian and Greek astrology were introduced. The first indisputable evidence of Jewish astrology occurs only in Qumran."

wolfpacsoldier,relationships,1389853882.0,"If this was her first post i would agree with you, but it's not. Read all her posts. This girl caused op and her brother and family a lot of drama and tried to ruin the relationship between op and her future in-laws. What melanie did was unexceptable bringing up the child that op lost and calling her a cheater and a drug addict. Honestly op has a right to act anyway she wants. And after reading her comments on all her posts, she's already acted as the bigger person and looks like she is going to continue doing so with her future in-laws which is what really matters. If she went around bragging to friends and family in real life then that would be different, but she already stated she has not done that. By the way your wrong. 

""Sounds pretty gossipy to me. OP's previous posts were about Melanie's attitude towards her as of late, and this post has literally nothing to do with how she's been acting towards OP. Did we really need to know all the dirty details of the scumbag cheating on her husband? Sure, it explains some of her shitty behavior, but it honestly has fuck all to do with OP herself. This isn't even an update. Just... gossip.""

Lets see, melanie tries to start shit and drive between a wedge between op and her future in-laws all because she was cheating on her husband and was unhappy and used op as a distraction and a scapegoat. Melanie dragged op into this, so how does the final out come not have to do with op herself?

It's all based on contextual circumstance. If you end up with blue balls because you get aroused and then turned down for sex, you have to wait until you have a private setting to masturbate in.

Nausved,changemyview,1389853922.0,"Remember, the comment did not claim these things *would* happen. It claimed that they *could* happen. The comment made no claims as to the likelihood of these particular scenarios coming to pass.

If someone doesn't think it is plausible that an insurance company might look for evidence of its clients partaking in unhealthy habits in order to raise insurance rates accordingly, and that it might do so by purchasing information about its clients from other companies, I would be curious to see the arguments against the notion. But if such a scenario *is* plausible, then the author of the comment committed no fallacy in listing this as an example of ways the selling of consumer information might hurt consumers.

&gt;What if the government took the information and locked you up in prison for jokingly saying you sold drugs and visiting drug-related websites? That is the same sort of argument that the original commenter was using, and we can both agree that this is something that theoretically could happen. But we would never say that this is a reason that the practice of selling info to advertisers shouldn't occur, because we don't believe that it is likely that the government will detain us based on joking about selling drugs or visiting drug websites.

The difference is that it would take many more changes for the government to do what you are suggesting than for an insurance company to do as the aforementioned comment suggested. Specifically, it would require some rather major changes in law and policy for the government to jail people for visiting drug-related websites or making drug-related jokes. 

So far as I am aware, there is no legal impediment to insurance companies changing clients' insurance rates based on photos of them smoking, and we know insurance companies already base insurance rates based on what they know of clients' smoking habits. If X *would* do Y and *could* do Y, who is to say it would be unlikely for X to do Y?"

First, suicide must be illegal in that state you are in. I'm very unfamiliar with the legality of suicide.

Second, the state would have to prove that you were there, knew what the person was doing (or going to do) and did nothing to prevent it.

Third (and perhaps most important), it may depend on whether your state has laws in place that would require a bystander to help out in situations where they are able. There's a name for these laws (kind of like Good Samaritan laws) but I can't remember what they are offhand. They are usually pretty hard to enforce but they do exist.

Fourth, it depends on the polices' attitudes.

blahtender,buildapc,1389854322.0,"Brand reliability is pretty crucial with PSUs. The 80+ Rating denotes the efficiency of the PSU, not the reliability. I would personally prefer the 80+ Gold, because I like to nickel and dime my power bill whenever possible. Seasonic is largely considered one of the most reliable brands, and other company's ""rebrand"" their PSUs for their own lines (like Antec). 

Yes, the CPU is also important, but the most expensive one isn't always the best fit for your build. For instance, since you didn't put an aftermarket CPU cooler, I would venture to say that overclocking isn't a priority for you, and the 4670K isn't necessarily going to game much noticeably better than  an i5 4340. You just can't overclock the 4340. 

The ASUS Maximus VI Hero is a great motherboard that looks awesome and has a lot of bells and whistles. It's a great choice if you want to run three video cards and Overclock the hell out of your CPU and/or GPU(s), and I think that one also has fancier audio hardware, but again, unless that audio is really the selling point for you, you can get an H87 and run your SLI or Crossfire, but can't overclock.

That case is awesome... good choice. And yeah, 750 should be plenty."

Reyalla508,poledancing,1389854356.0,"Hey! Success story here! You can do it. It sounds like you have very tight hip flexors. It's common for hip flexors to be so very tight because we're constantly lifting our legs up and forward in pole dancing. Try adding more stretches for the hip flexors to your routine like [pigeon stretch](http://www.yogaoutlet.com/userfiles/Guide/image/Yoga/Yoga-One-Legged-King-Pigeon-Pose-300x350.jpg) (and I do those variations as well). There's also the [side lying hip flexor stretch](http://mobsea.co/stretching/img/Lying_Hip_Flexor_and_Knee_Extensor_Stretch.jpg), which is a nice lighter stretch and a good one to start your hip flexor stretching with.

I suggest stretching 3x per week. Always stretch very warm muscles, as lengthening occurs when you add length (or stretch) to muscles that are cooling down. I like to take a hot bath and a few warm up exercises. You could always add a stretching session to the end of a pole or workout session of course. Hold stretches for 45 seconds to a minute and you shouldn't push it to the point of serious pain. If I were you I'd add some hip flexor stretching in literally every cool down. You'll definitely start to see progress! Just be consistent, and don't set a deadline. Flexibility is one of those areas where you just keep stretching and wait patiently to reap the rewards. "

ohgeronimo,Buddhism,1389854519.0,"&gt; Also, if I am ignorant, what will stop me from not helping others, if I am happy too?

Being unhappy to help others will stop you helping others. Being ignorant, would in theory, lead to expectation of result from your happiness to help others. Sometimes the person we give a helping hand to returns it with a spit in the eye. The ignorance of how things arise, flow, and cease might lead to unskillful views of the karma of doing such charitable actions.

Looking to see if you perform the action for the action or for the result would be looking to see what you are ignorant of. Knowing that which you are ignorant of, you become less ignorant.

Those that receive charity being grateful to those that have helped is not solely the result of being charitable. If you believe it to be, and become stressed because it shows itself to not be so, you are being ignorant of how it really is. Easing stress is one result from easing ignorance.

And some will say that ceasing ignorance will allow you to be motivated by that which is, rather than that which we would like to be. Helping others, laughing at a joke. Motivated to do so because by doing so it is done. Not for the result, but for the action being done. Laughing the way you laugh because you laugh that way.

I feel like I'm tangling together what I want to say, so please don't hesitate to ask if something is unclear. I sometimes require outside prompts so that I can look and know what I mean. Or what I do not mean.

screenmagnet,sex,1389854529.0,"All the guys I have dated, save my current guy, have been in math, compsci, or physics. I have dated my fair share of PhDs in these fields (including a TA). I also really like guys in these fields who are super athletic. I dated two math/compsci guys who did amateur competitive MMA. The juxtaposition was fucking hot.

I think a big part of the reason I enjoyed math in school is because I am turned on by guys who are good at math. It's like I want to be them and fuck them at the same time. I just need to inhabit their math-y brains, while their cocks inhabit my vagina.

Back in high school I had massive simultaneous crushes on two guys who were best friends and co-presidents of the math club. Their only member was me. I used to show up just to watch them argue over proofs on the blackboard. They would also sometimes argue over who was teaching me the topic better, and would get all possessive if I paid attention to one in front of the other. Sometimes it got to the point where one of them would get so pissed off and jealous that he would storm out of the classroom in a fit. God, what I would have done for that MMF threesome! I eventually found out that both had been into me as well. One of them audited grad school level math classes in grade 11, and would talk at me about what he learned in class. He went on to do a math PhD at Princeton, and work on stock market algorithms for an investment bank in NYC. The other used to take me outside into the school parking lot and stare at me intensely while performing impromptu chemistry experiments to impress me (typically involving some kind of combustible reaction), and he used to stalk me while I tutored other students in math and chemistry in the library. He went on to study physics at MIT and work for google. I also remember I used to get off on watching them play speed chess for money during lunch time, solve Rubik's cubes so fast that the cubes would break apart in their hands, and they would pass me notes in class to show off proofs that they were working on, with dirty innuendo in the margins. Ah, memories of high school sexual tension. This was my uber elitist version of making out with boys in the back of cars.

I really get off on the fact that I know so many guys who are now in prominent positions in the maths and sciences (I was a giftie, so almost all my classmates went really far in life). And I like when I talk to them, and they are surprised that I know their friends, classmates, and coworkers (it's a small world).

Wow, that was super long and now I feel like a creepy genius stalker. : /"

LucasSatie,NoStupidQuestions,1389854543.0,"The real answer? It depends.

Some brokers do get better deals from certain companies and thus may be able to save you some money. However, that doesn't mean they get good deals on every plan they sell nor are they obligated to sell you the best plan to fit your needs. Remember, they need to make money and they will attempt to sell you the plan that they think you are most likely to buy and will get them the largest pay check.

The best thing to do is to visit a broker, get some quotes and then **leave his office without making a choice**. Go home and then do some research online about what he told you. Can you find the same deal online? Can you find a *similar* deal online? How do the prices match up? Etc... Try and be smart about it. Broker's may help but in the end they are there to earn a living too.

Edit: realized I didn't answer part of your question.

How a broker is paid can vary but they are *usually* paid on commission. They will earn a certain percentage of what they sell you. Depending on *what* they sell you, the commission can be very minimal (like when selling renter's insurance) or very large (like when selling life insurance). There are a lot of differences and I can almost guarantee that the broker will not tell you their kickback numbers.

Very rarely there are brokers that work on straight pay or salary but they usually will only sell plans from a single company, though as long as that's the company you want these brokers may actually prove more useful."

ElderCunningham,pics,1389854688.0,"Going in, I was told to memorize the poem 'If,' by Kipling.  I didn't know anything else.

I was driven to a hiking spot by my uncle.  When we arrived, we were greeted by my grandfather who lead us to the base of the trail.  I was instructed to wait 5 minutes, then follow.  As I hiked, I ran into a different man who had an influence on my life (fathers of close friends, friends of my parents, my fourth grade teacher).  They each made a chalk marking on my arm, and said what it represented (things like perseverance, humor, love, etc).  Near top of the hill, a family friend said the last word, and blindfolded me.  He lead me to the top of the hill, where my dad read a speech he and my
Mom had written.  Each man then said a short speech about what their word meant.  I recited the poem.  I had the marks washed off as ""I already have those traits, this was just to commemorate them."" My dad presented the box.  I was turned around to face the ocean sky line as the men all recited a slightly different version of the last line of the poem.  ""Your's is the world and all that's in it, And what is more, you have become a man, my son"""

ChaoticParadox,asktrp,1389854708.0,"Betas orbit women and aren't aware of female manipulation. It's possible to be nice and still be red pill. Nice guys can still be alpha by not providing women they aren't fucking with resources or comfort. You can be nice without being a shoulder to cry on. You can be nice without being a free ride. You can be nice without money coming out of your wallet to support someone else's poor life decisions. Just be conscious of shaming tactics, and walk away when there's nothing to be gained.

&gt;&gt;woman who you choose to pursue

Alpha fucks, beta bucks: this means betas get used as ATMs while alphas get all the pussy. Betas pursue women. Alphas don't pursue women; they create attraction and dominate from the getgo. Personally, if a woman isn't receptive to my advances the first time, I just next them immediately. I have no patience for women that think they can control me, which is most of them. I don't go on dates, I fuck. I don't ask for numbers, I tell them to give me their number because I know they're attracted, and they willingly give it to me. I tell them to come over cause it's convenient for me. If she isn't going to respond the way I like, then she's defiant or has more options than she lets on. Either way, she's a pain in my ass. Next. 

Women are insane because they don't respond to nice guy behavior (they only say they want men to be nice so they can control them and use them for the money/resources), but they worship assholes who don't cave to objections, hold them to their words, will call them out when they lie, or fall for shaming language. Alphas dominate or they're gone. Simple as that.   

The real difference between blue pill and red pill thinking is choosing to value yourself over women which immediately takes them all off the pedestal. That means acknowledging that you have no reason, no real motivation to support a woman if she's not going to give you something you want in return now, not later. ( e.g., sex, love, relationships.) Chauvinism gets a bad rap cause women made it a pejorative term, but what's the female equivalent of that term? Feminist? Whatever it is, they sure as hell are female chauvinists by expecting you to foot the bill for everything, work for their attention, and spend your life slaving away to support their lifestyles while you eat shit hoping she'll give you a kiss. 

If a woman isn't worried about being annoying with her shitty behavior to you, then it's because she thinks she can manipulate you to do what she wants. Why? Because women are very well aware of their sexual allure and capitalize on it for as long as they possibly can until they hit the wall. That's when they settle down. That's when they look for a beta provider."

Here's the thing... If you got honest answers from women who have had abortions, you're going to hear BOTH answers... For many women, given the circumstances, it is the best thing for them... For many others, they regret it for whatever reason... and for still others, while it was the best option in the moment, years later they regret the decision. (Unfortunately, you likely won't get a lot of response from those who regret their decision because talking about it means they have to relive it.) 

Don't look at having a child as preventing you from experiencing life... Look at it as experiencing a different life than the one you planned for yourself.

Pregnancy is scary.  Having PCOS is scary - and complicates things greatly.  Having kids is scary - I don't care how old or young you are.  LIFE is scary. 

Between the PCOS and the abnormally shaped uterus, you already know that conception (and I would expect carrying to term) will be difficult.  Take into consideration how your physiology will affect the chances of having kids in the future (if that's something you want.)

Billtodamax,fireemblem,1389854876.0,"Chapter 25: Alright, let's do it. We are introduced to what is possibly the least likeable character yet. I like to imagine him as the bad guy from Elysium, because then I can think he talks in a south african accent.

Oh hey, Merlinus got a swag cart. No stat gains for promoting though, which is a bit shit. Give him some pity strength or something. I mean I guess he gets movement. Anyway. I easily have the money to give to Farina, because I abused the shit out of the arena.

Also, at some point I bought like a billion handaxes, and now they're just sitting in my convoy. I really don't know what I thought I was going to do with all of these handaxes, but I guess Raven, Hector, Dart, and Oswin can all take one and see how they go. They're pretty good weapons I guess, although I seem to recall them being better in fe6.

Anyway the mission. I have enough room to take literally everyone I want to take, and Geitz, *and* Isadora. I'm not taking Geitz and Isadora.

Dart, Rath, and Canas are going to attempt to take the bottom left fort with the help of Lucius, Priscilla, and Raven. Hector, Florina, and Oswin are going to push for the top left fortress with Rebecca and Sain assisting. When Farina shows up she's going to try and level up a lot taking on the right fortress.

Rebecca is saturated in targets for her Ballista but I figure fuck peg knights and murder the bastards.

So it turns out the boss will totally charge you first chance he gets. Unfortunately for him, he ran into Oswin and Hector. Hector sets him up, Oswin knocks him down.


Now, the monks on this level literally cannot hurt Farina. So, I decide to feed all of them to her, while her sister flies around visiting villages and buying me things.

Anyway once that's done the map is basically over. Is this here to waste weapon usages, or what? I get Farina and Dart to support.

CHAPTER 26: So it turns out Bern has a bunch of Lizard Knights. Woop dee doo. Last time I checked, flying horses ate lizards for breakfast.

I uh...

I'm not a vet.

Anyway so the bad guy of FE6 and his sister have an adorable heart to heart, and Hector assumes that we have weaker members. Not in this man's army.

The right group will be composed of Dart, Rebecca, Farina, and Sain. They're gonna guard/use the ballista to rain fiery death down upon those who oppose me. I'm also going to try and feed Farina a couple of levels so she can promote. Should not be too hard. She's a little behind in speed at the moments, but ahead in luck and average everything else. Should be a good addition to the team.

Left side is Oswin, Florina, Priscilla, Lucius, Raven, Canas, and Rath. Oswin and Canas are going to go help out our lords while everyone else will push hard for that village. Shouldn't be too hard with Florina playing with the bandits in the mountains.

Oh hey I get Pent and Louise now. Where were you arseholes during Crazed heart? Pieces of shit. Lyn uses the Heaven Seal because fuck Eliwood. I'm pretty upset I can't use it on Hector, but such are the trials of Hector Mode.

I realise very quickly that Rath and Florina can keep the mountains clear of bandits very easily, so I send Farina over to farm some more kills.

I manage to get her just enough exp off the wyvern reinforcements to promote - she's a bit speed screwed, but she's a peg, she'll get it up there. 

I manage to get to the shop that sells killer weapons, and buy them without Florina dying. She had to be holding an Iron Lance otherwise she'd get doubled by Vaida with the Uber Spear. Even then she had to dodge two hits of around 60% from Vaida's flunkies which both would have killed her after Vaida's first hit. It's worth it for the sweet, sweet killer weapons though.

Next time I should probably take Ninian and Nini's grace Florina before she goes in.

Anyway Lyn pulls out some racist stereotypes (""All sacaens can track"", ""No sacaen ever lies"") and we find the Black Fang fortress.

CHAPTER 27: Man Vaida really doesn't look like a recruitable character. Anyway. I'm taking the same group as last time, except I'm not forced to bring Eliwood so I won't, and Hector's support crew isn't coming because they're both level 10 already to make room for Matthew and Ninian.

Rath and Ninian work together to murder the bolting mage instantly, because I'm not accepting no worn Bolting.

Joining Rath and Ninian will be Dart, Rebecca, Sain, Farina, and Canas. This is the B-team. The A-team (that is, the newly promoted Lyn, Hector, and the real meat of the team: Priscilla/Lucius/Raven support triangle) will be going up, with a brief detour by Lucius to murder all those knights. Matthew will be opening doors for the B-team.

Anyway surprise surprise, The A-team (I have decided that Lyn will be B.A. Baracus) murders their way up the left flank spearheaded by Raven, while the B-team futzes around in the corridors achieving nothing. I murder the shit out of most enemies on the map before that one character I get to recruit shows up, so I guess I get Karel. That's fine, my Raven is awesome and is hooked up with all his supports.

I recruit him with Lyn and man, Karel, you are one creepy motherfucker. She's engaged to Eliwood by now! I hope! She was dropping clues to that dumb Lord for a long time so he must have picked them up by now.

Farina and Dart get up to B support before Farina goes and kills the fat guy who's name I'm not sure I ever bothered to learn.

OH WELL.

CHAPTER 28: Alright. This map is generally pretty awful but let’s see what we can do. Oswin, Ninian, and Eliwood are sitting out from this map. Raven, Priscilla, and Lucius are heading left with Legault, Dart, and Farina. Lyn, Rath, Rebecca, Sain, Florina, and Canas are going right with Hector and Matthew, and probably Merlinus as well, because Matthew is lugging around like 3 lock pick uses so I might need to bust out the keys.

Turns out that’s kinda pointless because someone promptly drops a fresh lockpick for me. Thanks guy! Priscilla is blazing it down the left side to intercept the thieves and almost receives a lance to the face from a sub boss for her troubles, but she’s awesome and dodges it. Then Lucius and Farina follow her up and wipe him out while she heads for the thieves. Meanwhile Rath, Sain, and Florina close to within spitting distance of Nino. Priscilla manages to murder the first thief while blocking up the door to the treasure, so I have that secured. Meanwhile I bring Lyn in to recruit Nino while sending the Archery friends down to take out Ursula so she stops bolting the shit out of me. Farina picks up Jaffar and drags him right so Nino can talk to him, while down in the bottom left corner of the map I have Raven dodge thunders from what I assume to be the last mage on the map. I get the Delphi shield and Boots and Brave Lance and Rescue, then wait to see if any more reinforcements are coming. None come, so I murder the mage on the last turn. I feel a bit silly when the map doesn’t immediately end, but Raven needed the exercise anyway.

Eliwood gives the queen a verbal beat-down and I high-five him mentally. Queen Hellene gives us a Heaven Seal and a map to our next side quest which I totally just stumbled into. Good thing I somehow got the requirements, cause I have no internet to check how to get it.

CHAPTER 28x: Ugggggh. This map. This map is why I wish Fiora and Heath turned out better. Eliwood promotes and becomes a really mediocre Paladin. Oswin’s sitting out again because he’s still a relatively high level. So is Florina but I am not doing this fucking map without all my flyers. Nino’s going to try and get trained up this map but I’m never any good at doing that. Dart and Farina are going to be going North by themselves to secure those treasure chests with a chest key,	Florina will fly around keeping those ballistas pristine, everyone else will push forwards and try and get Nino kills.

Okay, so the bridge I expected to appear instantly has not appeared yet. I mean, I’m managing to feed Nino levels, but I am still on the initial platform while Dart starts opening the chests. Turns out you can’t bring Merlinus to this level, so he has to drop a vulnerary and the remaining 2 uses on the chest keys to grab everything. Meanwhile I’m finding Eliwood perfect for levelling up Nino, because he can’t kill anything. You found your purpose  buddy.

Meanwhile I notice one more chest that I didn’t realise was on the map, so I send Florina over to murder a thief once he steals it for me. She kills a general that’s determinedly sitting on the chest, then about fifty angry pirates (dodging like a champ) then finally the thief asshole who wants my speedwing. There are so many units on the map now, it’s hilarious.

Okay so the bridge finally appears and it turns out there’s basically no one left on the map after Florina counter kills a shit ton of pirates. At least the pirates that spawned close gave Nino a bunch of levels – she’s at 11 now. I manage to get her up to 14 off some nomads that Rebecca weakens for her with the ballista and a lot of rescue shenanigans. I have her clean up the last enemies on the map except her mother pretty easily. I send her up to talk to mum and she gets an entire blizzard to the face for her troubles, dealing back precisely no damage. Eliwood and Lyn slowly whittle down Sonia over a few turns with some helpful crits. They are by far my worst units. Dart and Farina get their A support, and Hector seizes."

cunctatrix,dating_advice,1389855277.0,"To be honest, without a picture/pictures of how you ""normally"" look, it's hard to give input that would help you *personally* the most.

From the perspective of more general advice, there are a few categories to consider:

* Skincare. Generally, face is most important in this area. Maybe you have acne, in which case you might need more intensive cleaning products; maybe you don't, in which case soap and water might do the trick. Most guys don't have a problem with the washing part, but a lot don't realize the difference a bit of moisturizer can make, especially if you have dry or sensitive skin that gets flaky or blotchy a lot. (Plus, if you use a bit of lotion/moisturizer, it makes your skin that much nicer to touch and inviting - more 'glow' less dull, if that makes sense.)
* Hair. I mean, guys have it pretty easy on this one. With pretty short hair you just need to cut it every so often. If you do want longer hair, especially as you're getting past the jaw line, you should really consider using a bit of conditioner. Again, makes it a little softer and more inviting, and also prevents it from looking like a damaged rat's nest. (See, for example, [this guy](http://www.ronalfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/man_long_hair.jpg) as a less extreme example. His hair looks pretty damaged especially near the ends. Conditioner would make it less frizzy/broken and better looking.) Of course, you can also let it get too greasy if you don't wash it enough or put too much gel/product in it, which is also a problem. As far as styling goes... I really don't know the ins and outs of that so you should probably look to the other responses. Just don't try and do something like use a combover to hide a bald spot, it's usually obvious. (Honestly, if you're balding at a young age especially, it might be best just to go full bald.)
* Clothing. A lot of this depends on what your style is, but a few things that I've noticed tend to work well more broadly are to find clothes that are actually pretty well fitted and to find clothes that are relatively high quality. Now, I'm not saying go out there and buy all $500 designer shirts, but maybe look at something a little higher end than you normally go, paying attention to the quality of materials. If you don't think you're good at figuring out what's high quality and how to get the best quality and fit for your money, consider asking some of your female friends who are pretty knowledgeable about this stuff to come shopping with you and help you out. (I'm sure at least some of them will be more than happy to - this is something that's happened in my friend groups a lot, and the guys always ended up looking a lot better. Also, they're likely to help you pick what's going to look most attractive to women, so that's a big plus.) As far as finding stuff that fits you, that doesn't mean you have to get everything tailored, though it might be a good idea to have a few key items tailored (e.g. a suit) or to have one outfit tailored so you know what it feels like when something fits you like a glove. But generally just try and pay attention to how baggy/tight *all* areas of an item are and how well they follow the outlines of your body. Also, pay attention to details. Something like having your shoes and belt matching might not seem like a big thing, but if it doesn't happen, it can make the whole outfit look slightly ""off"". And, lastly, when in doubt, go with the more conservative or classic option. You'll never go wrong with a classic button down and khakis; the silk paisley open-face shirt, on the other hand, you might come to regret.
* Eyebrows. This might be controversial and it definitely is a matter of personal preference, but something I've noticed that makes a difference is when men neaten up their eyebrows a little bit. You don't have to get them threaded or any of that bullshit, but when guys take the time to remove the stray hairs and trim the more rebellious bits so that the brows have a more solid border, it helps them look clean cut and it frames their eyes/face better. YMMV depending on who you're approaching and what look you're going for.
* On that note, body hair generally. Some women are really into the mountain man look, some want their men shining and hairless, and there are plenty in between. Trimming is entirely a personal preference so do whatever you want with that, although if you're going to have a beard, I recommend keeping it relatively neat and shapely. Also, aside from obviously arms/legs/face, try to avoid showing too much. A (very) little tuft from the chest peeking out over the shirt is okay, but it shouldn't look like you have a cat hidden in your shirt or something. Also, if you have thick body hair, be aware how much odors can get caught in there and figure out how to deal with that.
* Posture. It's probably cliche, but seriously, body language and facial expressions can really impact how you ""look"" to someone. If a guy is standing tall and smiling at me, I'm going to feel a lot better about him than if he's scowling and slouching.
* If you're not already, consider working out. Even if you're at a good size, exercise can change your body composition so that it's more muscle/less fat, which tends to make you look better (clothes on or off) even if the number on the scale doesn't change.

Some of that is probably super obvious and obviously everyone has different preferences, so take it with a grain of salt, but I hope at least some of it was useful."

Skulder,Denmark,1389855504.0,"En plan mod bandekriminalitet, der ikke gør noget som helst for at fjerne deres indtægtskilde, er ikke en god plan.

De dumme unger der starter på kriminalitet, overvejer ikke om forbrydelsen er straffen værd - de kigger på chancen for at blive fanget, kontra gevinsten, og der er sku gode penge at tjene på at sælge stoffer, og risikoen *er* relativt lille, hvis man ikke er fast sælger.

Hvis folk var rationelle og så videre, så ville fængsels-*straf* virke afskrækkende, men se jer omkring! Folk spiller lotto, Peter Lundin fik en kæreste, mange kører uden sikkerhedssele - Mennesker har håb og urealistiske forventninger til virkeligheden, og det kan man ikke lave om på.


Dertil, uanset hvor inhumane man gjorde fænglserne, så var der nok nogle af dem der er vokset op under værre forhold, så det vil *altid* være ""et ferieophold"" for nogle. Lad være med at pive over at fængslerne er for blødsødne - det kunne være at du selv skulle derind en dag.

Men uanset det - når først de her unger (som føler at de ikke har alverden at miste), har prøvet at sælge nogle stoffer, har fundet ud af at det gik relativt let, og at de kan tjene en del penge på det, så kan jeg ikke lige se at de skulle holde op. Risikoen virker ikke meget større anden gang, og de kan tjene nogle tusinde om måneden, så let som ingenting.

Man kan jo sagtens lave en analogi, ikke? Kast to terninger: Hvergang du ikke slår 12, får du 10.000 kroner. Hvis du får 12, så sker der noget slemt - du ved teoretisk set godt hvad, men det er lidt svært at sætte sig ind i *hvor* slemt det måske er. Uanset, du ved med dig selv, at du er en tough motherfucker, som kan klare hvad som helst.  
Så længe de 10.000 kroner ligger og lokker, er der altid nogen der kaster de terninger.

Så den der Bandepakke, den gi'r jeg ikke meget for.  
* Vi udviser allerede så godt som alt det vi kan i forhold internationale menneskerettigheder.  
* Jeg har ikke hørt nogen af de normale talsmænd for politiet eller anerkendte psykologer sige at straffene med fordel kan gøres længere.  
* Der er allerede hårde straffe for chikane af politiet - problemet er ikke de korte straffe, men at folk ikke bliver grebet i det.  
* At de vil forøge budgetterne til fængslerne er fint, men ordlyden får mig til at tænke at de hæver budgettet med 10 %, og øger belastningen med 12%  
*  Ideen om at bevare Vridsløselille fængel er til grin. Konstruktionen er fra 1859, og det er sku begrænset hvad man kan stille op med sådan et monstrum. Kriminalforsorgen har selv frabedt sig det, og det virker som et forslag der er begrundet med Straf, Straf, og middelalderlig tortur til de lærer det!

----

Jeg tror på at jo færre regler, des bedre kan vi have det. Vi behøves kun at lave en ny regel, fordi folk viser sig at være uansvarlige idioter, og hver gang vi laver sådan en regel, gør vi også livet lidt sværere, for dem som godt kan finde ud af hvordan man skal være.

Det her regelsæt har så mange muligheder for at være uretfærdige, mod nogle der ikke har gjort sig fortjent til det. Det ligner noget der kan føre til strafudmålinger der på ingen måde er rimelige i forhold til kriminaliteten der er udført, og det vil jeg ikke være med til."

brofession,Journalism,1389855859.0,"Hazelwood, Missouri? At least 10% of the people at my college are alma maters.

As for the heroin story you want to do, two things...

1. I honestly would build up to a drug story. If you're in high school, then you don't have the chops to do something like that yet. Drugs affecting an area is a very complicated issue and could put you in significant danger if you go into rougher parts of town to research the story. I would never discourage my reporters from chasing down a story, especially if it could piss off the administration, but I would never put them in a position where they could get hurt. It's another story if you're just talking to the cops or other advocacy organizations. tl;dr: make sure you can tell the whole story correctly before you embark on a touchy subject and don't put yourself in any sort of danger (you're still young.)

2. On the administration not letting you publish touchy issues, ask your advisor if your website is hosted on district servers or paid for by the school in any way. If it isn't, you can post it as an online exclusive and the school probably can't have it taken down as long as it doesn't contain libel. You won't be able to get the administration's comments for the story, but ""X declined to comment for this story"" can say more than any interview ever can."

While the underlying concepts (algorithms, logic, math, etc) are all the same, the actual application and implementation changes over time much faster than our traditional engineering brethren.

For example, we're still taught C when learning about memory management and finer system programming. The shell project and HTTP server project in CS252 have probably been the same for at least a decade. However, in those same classes, we're also tasked with writing apps for mobile devices, which is definitely a new thing.

But that means the benefits of technological progress are being enjoyed by only the owners of capital, while that progress is actually harming workers, who are most of the population. Maybe those workers who do have jobs will have access to cheaper goods, but having more cheap stuff is not exactly the pressing need of our society right now, wouldn't you agree?

CarrowCanary,sto,1389856123.0,"Strike- is one of the better DOff missions. Even better for people that only play Fed, it's a regular source of Contraband and one of the few ways to get prisoners blue-side.

Also, as you'll have discovered, critting it can get you a blue (or sometimes even purple) prisoner, which is lovely for interrogation assignments. When you get several, you may want to run a Dominion Prisoner exchange though, which can be found in the Cardassian sectors.

Other DOff missions to look out for: 

* [NADoRC](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Assignment:_Negotiate_Additional_Delivery_of_Rare_Commodities) jumps out as an obvious one, but it's not as valuable as it used to be. You need to run the 1/1 chain mission first, it has the same name, minus the Additional bit.

* Check your medical department head regularly for [Reclaim Assimilated Borg Drones](http://www.stowiki.org/Assignment:_Reclaim_Assimilated_Borg_Drones). Critting it gives you a Borg Duty Officer. Usually green, can be blue, I assume there's a possibility of purple, but I've never seen it.

* [Special Deal on Entertainment Provisions](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Assignment:_Special_Deal_on_Entertainment_Provisions). This is a good one. There are 4 versions, one for each rarity. If you crit it, you get an Entertainment Hologram DOff of the rarity that matches the assignment you ran.

* [Instigate Defection](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Assignment:_Instigate_Defection) gives you a DOff from the opposing faction.

* Colony chains. Each exploration nebula offers a chain, [x/7](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Assignment_chain:_Colonization). Finishing the chain gets you a blue DOff. Critting [the repeatable](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Assignment:_Support_Colonization_Efforts) at the end gives you a purple.

* Finally, keep an eye out for people offering invites to SCS ships, Cell ships, Suliban ships, Sofa ships etc. They have [a DOff assignment](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Assignment_chain:_Tau_Dewa_Aid) inside them that takes 5 days to complete, and awards Suliban DOffs with unique abilities for active duty."

It's true there is probably an optimal, statistically build or weapon or w/e for doing damage, or something. First of all, that better be damn hard to obtain. But more importantly, that means there needs to be other options besides just doing the most damage.

Put in a way to be the best stunner, so the DPS guy is useless for awhile, or a way to be the best tank, so the you can outlast the hits even without doing as much dmg. Within that, make it so you can dodge-tank, HP-tank, Armor-tank, Speed-tank... spend the time and playtest to make sure each one can be played to such a degree that it doesn't make any other one pointless. EVE is a decent example of this, although it still is not immune to the [Dominant Strategy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_dominance) syndrome, mainly because the game itself is extremely complicated. 

I guess to re-iterate my point with an example:
In Guild Wars 1 you could choose from a set of abilities. If there's 200 abilities and only 20 get usage in common gameplay by the players (Which are stats that devs should be able to access), there has been an error in game design and something needs to be tweaked to make the players actually want to use the rest of your game instead of just a small portion of it. 

Riot is actually somewhat admirable since they do actually respond to abilities being used too often, but the whole genre is just ridden with hyper-aggresivism in the players due to the competitive and sport-like nature.

They each made a chalk marking on my arm, and said what it represented (things like perseverance, humor, love, etc). Near top of the hill, a family friend said the last word, and blindfolded me. He lead me to the top of the hill, where my dad read a speech he and my Mom had written. Each man then said a short speech about what their word meant. I recited the poem.

Imagine that the wires are pipes and the electricity running through is flowing water. The current is like the flow rate and the resistors are like coffee filters that try to slow down the flow of water. If there are filters in series, all the water flowing through one filter has to go through the next one. If the path splits to two filters, then water going through is going to preferentially go through the easiest route.

oldmonty,lifehacks,1389856597.0,"I was just giving my opinion, I see both sides of the issue. 

&gt;You should always expect that if you put content out there that it will always be yours. This is a fundamental of how copyright law works

Not only is this not how copyright law works but copyright law in this country is fundamentally flawed. Not only flawed but it doesnt work the way it was intended anymore, serving only as a deterrent for some while actually being maliciously used to stifle innovation and critique for others. 

Copyrights on material have expiration dates, while these have been increased several times through various laws (mostly brought on by lobbying from media companies) a fundamental principle is that one day your work will become public domain. The law says that this should occur long after you die, which made sense when the law was written and books were the primary medium but doesnt make much sense in this day and age when the shelf-life of being able to even make money off of a piece of content is about a month (except movies which have maybe half a year). 

While its one thing to *want* content to remain yours forever because you put the time and effort into producing it, its completely delusional to *expect* it to be this way with how things work now.

&gt;there is a big difference between recording something off a TV or Radio (which comes with ads and at times subscriptions) and full on downloading an bluray copy of a movie.

Sure but recording sound off of a radio to an audio tape in the manner I described is *equally illegal* as downloading a full bluray copy of a movie, they cant catch you for it unless you try and sell them but its falls under the same law. 

&gt;Streaming lowers the bitrate and resolution, they aren't serving full original sources. They probably aren't even serving bluray quality. So they are usually getting a better quality of product than what they usually would.

Now this is actually missing the entire point of what I was saying, you wouldnt download bluray quality if you were trying to find an alternative to streaming, blu-ray files are tens of gigabytes minimum. You would probably be downloading the same resolution as netflix with compression if not less resolution as a result of encoding. I dont see this as stealing, I'm getting the same or possibly a slightly worse product, you are still getting paid, and you are saving money. 

&gt;These things aren't free. Nor is the products like ""enhanced dvr"" 

You can set one up for a one-time cost which is nominal (mine was 15$ plus the hard drive cost) pre-assembled ones like ti-vo run around 100$ afaik and if, like you said, you are paying monthly for a dvr which doesnt have as many features why not just pay the cost one time?

I dont see how its different to download my favorite show and watch it on my computer when its already recorded on my dvr. I'm already paying for it and I'm not going to watch the ads either way. I could also just as easily invest in a slingbox which allows me to do the same thing, taking the file off the local dvr and sending it to me remotely, except the reason I dont do this is because the slingbox, which I also happen to own, is glitchy crap. 

You didnt address the philosophical issue I brought up: are my memories a form of recording, how is it actually different from pointing a camera at a television or movie theater screen? What? Just because I cant interface with the storage my brain uses and pull the images off of there suddenly its like they were never recorded? 

Is listening to [daniel tosh describe the entire plot of the human centipede](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR_VImYq3Ek) stealing the content of that movie, and was he distributing pirated works because he remembered the whole thing and then told others what it was?

What ruined it, though, was how it was shoved down my throat for the rest of the series.  

And then, the last chapter of the last book comes around, and Richard is suddenly the Creator, and there's a parallel world without magic for all the magic-haters (and Pillars of Creation) to live in.

Rekommenderar dig att läsa [NJA 2009 s. 447 I och II](http://www.notisum.se/rnp/domar/hd/HD009447.htm), HD:s uttalande under I kopieras nästan alltid in i våldtäktsdomar numera:

&gt;För en fällande dom i ett mål om sexualbrott krävs liksom i brottmål i övrigt att domstolen genom den utredning som förebringats i målet finner det ha blivit ställt utom rimligt tvivel att den tilltalade har gjort sig skyldig till vad som lagts honom till last. Det är således inte tillräckligt att målsägandens berättelse är mer trovärdig än den tilltalades. Ett åtal är i mål om sexualbrott lika lite som i något annat sammanhang styrkt genom att målsägandens och den tilltalades utsagor vägs mot varandra och målsägandens därvid bedöms väga tyngre. (Jfr bl.a. NJA 1992 s. 446.)

&gt;Vid påstådd brottslighet av förevarande slag saknas ofta direkta vittnesiakttagelser och teknisk bevisning till stöd för åtalet. Det hindrar inte att bevisningen ändå kan befinnas tillräcklig för en fällande dom. En huvuduppgift i sådana mål är att bedöma trovärdigheten av målsägandens utsaga. En alltigenom trovärdig utsaga från målsäganden kan i förening med vad som i övrigt har framkommit i målet - t.ex. om målsägandens beteende efter händelsen - vara tillräcklig för en fällande dom. (Jfr bl.a. NJA 1991 s. 83 och NJA 2005 s. 712.) Det är dock ett rimligt krav att målsägandens berättelse till den del det är praktiskt möjligt blivit kontrollerad under förundersökningen, låt vara att brister i det avseendet inte utan vidare behöver leda till bedömningen att åtalet inte har blivit styrkt."

Gorptastic,Anarcho_Capitalism,1389857139.0,"Productivity gains in what -- is the question. In economic terms, as total factor productivity increases, so should the wage rate and the total amount of goods produced and consumed. Since laborers work for wages, they will earn a higher income as a result of greater technology, and they have a greater purchasing power than before when there was less technology.

Technology also increases knowledge (i.e. human capital), lifts people out of poverty the world over, and still has a long way to go before we should consider chronic unemployment as a serious problem. New industries are always coming and going. To assume that some piece of technology is here to stay suggests a lack of creativity to find new solutions to the problems we have had for thousands of years.

I think a more compelling argument is as follows. Supposedly we have reached a tipping point of automation and technological advancement (such that any more increases would make many people worse off to the benefit of the very few). How can that be, when 61 percent of the world population does not have access to Internet? How can there be a surplus of well-educated students when 1 billion people on Earth are illiterate? How can human beings call themselves ""automated"" when about 2/5 of the world lacks indoor plumbing? Despite all this, why have poverty rates been *decreasing* over the past few decades?"

I wish people would stop using that word in relation to Clannad. Clannad is a wonderful show filled with majesty and romance and friendship and laughter and maybe just a tear or two... And yet, because it wasn't as good as After Story, it is constantly stated as being something to endure, to get past, to slog through, to suffer a punishment game because you have to watch it in order to see the majesty of After Story. That view is bullshit to the highest degree.

Is Clannad's rating lower than After Story? Yes. Of course. But a rating drop between 9.16 for AS and 8.54 for Clannad doesn't signify that the show is absolute crap.

Also, again because of the older tech, high ISO performance is just a lot weaker (there's a reason the 1D Mk II is capped at 3200 while your old T3i could do 12,800).

For the first problem you should adjust the image settings in the camera (sharpness, color, noise reduction setting if that exists) or better yet shoot RAW which will bring your process quality to par with modern camera. The comparatively ""noisy"" sensor is here to stay though but don't worry about it so much, the 1D MkII was one of the most used pro-cameras not long ago, world class photographers have shot and gained praise with it."

ohgeronimo,Buddhism,1389857357.0,"Personally, when I meditate, I do so for generally one of two reasons. One, because I'm not calm and by doing so I am being calm (anxiety and such, it's quite nice to just notice your anxiety and let it cease). Two, because I enjoy it. I sit, to sit, I breathe, to breathe, I observe, to observe. I listen to music to listen to music, in much the same way. Sometimes I might be prompted by someone to check out an awesome new song, but when I listen to it I am just listening to it. Not because they want me to, not because I want to dissect it, but just because I want to hear it.

It's the same way with everything else in my life, really. I may be prompted by all sorts of things, but when I do something I'm doing it because I have chosen to do it. I can have hopes, and desires, and wishfull thinking of the outcomes of such things, but truly the reason I do it is because I chose to do it. The food might be delicious, and that's a great result, but I'm cooking it because I desire to cook it right here and now.

I've never really done anything I didn't on some level accept as my desire to do. Even pain, I accept it to be undesirable and by doing so desire it to be painful. It's just a sensation unless I give it meaning by my desire for it to have one. Of course, I also understand that desiring not to desire will only lead to more desire. So I desire to meditate, I meditate, and thus ceases the desire to meditate until it arises again. No goal, just doing. The idea of enlightenment coming about from it is just an idea, and if it happens it happens. I focus on what I can or am doing. I desire to sit, I can sit, I sit, I desire to stand, I can stand, I stand. Having written what I wanted to write, I stop. Your reaction, your desire, your result after having read, just so. Perhaps that will prompt another desire from me, perhaps not. Of course, there are other things I have not wanted to write about, so I have not."

andjok,Anarcho_Capitalism,1389857443.0,"To anarchists, rents are basically the same thing as taxes but on a smaller scale.  You have to pay just to exist on a certain plot of land or face violent consequences, where the owner improves the property little to not at all.

Now, I don't think rent is *inherently* exploitative, but I think that in certain circumstances that it could be and I see where the socialists are coming from.  Imagine a situation where a handful of people owned all the residences in a large city, which they have inherited from previous generations (so they didn't improve the property themselves).  With little competition, they are able to charge exorbitant rents, meaning the city's residents have no choice but to pay those exorbitant prices for the simplest of living arrangements or leave the city (analogous to ""pay your taxes or gtfo of this country"").  Now, I think this situation would be almost impossible in a real free market, but it could very well happen in a state-capitalist system.

So basically, rent (and wage-labour, for that matter) are mainly seen as exploitative because many people do not really have the option to live somewhere or provide for themselves without having to give up some of the fruits of their labor and obey someone else's rules.  The fewer options people have, the more they are able to be exploited.  Of course, it is the entire corporate state system that limits people's options, and not necessarily the landlords themselves, which is why it can sound confusing to hear that landlords exploit people."
thang1thang2,unixporn,1389857449.0,"Not to be too preacy, of course, but I'd gladly recommend firefox over chrome for the one single extension Pentadactyl (or vimperator if you prefer). It's so far beyond what's capable in chrome with vimium that you'll wonder how you ever used chrome in the first place.

And I'm glad to see that GTK handles high resolution well! It's probably due to the scaling factors used in it being very similar (I think) to the scaling resources in Android (both are ""*nix"" based, after all). 

I was never a fan of the trackpoints on the thinkpads, to be honest. They were a great idea, but I always liked mac trackpads much more. Ever since switching to Linux full time, though, I've not used the trackpad much and it doesn't really hold the same 'shine' for me that it used to. I honestly wouldn't see much of a difference from using a ""windows"" laptop now, since it's all Linux anyway. My big requirement would be I would want a new laptop that's equal/better in build quality and feel than a mac (I'll never buy a plastic laptop again)

The other thing that's special for me is I use my laptops heavily. And I mean extremely heavily. This is a late 2011 MBP I'm typing on and the paint has stripped off of the 'e' key, and several other keys have had the letters bleed from the oil seeping into the keys so hard. The trackpad has oil baked into it so it's far smoother than it should be (which actually feels really nice), the palm rests are literally ever-so-slightly indented from heat from my palms over time, metal is warped on the cage, and I've used the laptop for over 4,000 hours without even trying. I'd need something that could handle that kinda brutal usage for sure :)

The thing I see myself using a laptop for in the future is coding, software development, sysadmin type stuff (all linux based) and then graphical/autoCAD type of things (windows, engineering), and graphics, design, media items (photoshop, photography, media creation and organization). And that would probably be on windows due to my most likely not upgrading to a new mac. Or, if I do end up getting a new mac, it would be on OS X. Which, to be honest, is my second favorite OS right behind Arch, being behind only due to the annoyances of using it 'trackpad free' like you can with Linux."

As your measurements indicate firmer breasts and average squish on your ribcage, I'd think the basic way is probably more accurate, and I'd start by trying in the 38FF/36G range.  

However, if in your current 38DD, after fully and aggressively swooping and scooping, your gore almost or completely tacks and you have only a modest amount of quadboob, try the 38E/36FF first.

I still want you to [read this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus#Transmission) and think about how there is a chance he did not transmit it to you AND/OR he did not receive it through sex. Even though you discovered he lied about his history (just to be clear, that is fifty shades of not okay), I still highly doubt he knew he had it. That's not something they test for in men. So the HPV is not his bad, all the other dumbfuckery is.

Regarding getting him back--I mean, you wouldn't ruin somebody's life for giving you HPV in the context of full-disclosure, consensual, awesome lovey sex. He was a really shitty person to you and in general. It's been years. Move on, his bullshit has probably caught up with him in many ways and will continue to."

Piracy has become the incapable producer's scapegoat, cant make money off your content, blame piracy. When in reality it was probably just shit to begin with. People have been shown to buy content they like even if they got it for free initially. Red vs blue has had major success with this. Monty python saw sales of their products increase ~~1000%~~ [Im sorry it was 23000%](http://www.slashfilm.com/free-monty-python-videos-on-youtube-lead-to-23000-dvd-sale-increase/) after they posted their entire videos for free on youtube.  

Also, how are people losing jobs? The media industries have been making record profits year after year because people are still buying stuff they enjoy. Content producers dont make the bulk of their money on dvd or record sales. Really the only people hurting are companies who fail to adapt properly, for example, the rate of torrenting certain tv shows is in the millions for foreign countries who dont have *any* legal access to that content. They cant stream it with a subscription, they cant buy it for cash, so they *have* to torrent it, or wait for sometimes years until its available, whats the big idea? The company is in between my money and its bank account for no reason, then it screams piracy. "

Aldairion,AskMen,1389857976.0,"I used to live with three women. It's only a disaster if you make it one, but be prepared for a few ""new"" things.

1. Don't sleep with them. That's a textbook example of shitting where you eat. Just don't. 

2. Toilet paper goes FAST. Seriously, I don't know how you'll work out who buys what but stock up on your own toilet paper. I've never seen anything go so quickly as I have toilet paper in a woman's house. Also, if you're sharing a bathroom, be prepared for it to turn into a mad scientist's chemistry lab. 

3. If they're already friends, they *may* get in little arguments. Make it clear you aren't taking sides with either of them. If they have problems, you need to be kept out of it. Decide who cooks, cleans, and gets to watch what and when. Typical room mate stuff.

4. Be clear on the rules of bring home other girls. If them judging the girls you bring home will make you uncomfortable you need to tell them and enforce it.

5. I don't know if it's just the girls I lived with, but others have mentioned to me too that women are a little more possessive/territorial. I caught a lot of hell for accidentally eating some of ""their fruit"" or borrowing things from their rooms even though I had explicit permission to do so. They were just upset that I went into their rooms to get it rather than asking them to get it out for me. Maybe I just have a different outlook, but I never had such issues with any male room mates I've had before.  

6. You may get left out simply because those two are already friends and they happen to be girls. My old room mates were all friends and they had their own core group of friends who were often at our house. I was friendly enough with them, but I went over to my friends houses far more than I ever had my friends over at my place. 

Really though, living with women is no different. Everything just smells nicer. Just do your part and be a good room mate, stay civil and friendly with them...like a brother or something. It's unconventional, but I feel like, because of that, people think that it's going to be a bigger deal than it really needs to be.

I was driven to a hiking spot by my uncle. When we arrived, we were greeted by my grandfather who lead us to the base of the trail. I was instructed to wait 5 minutes, then follow. As I hiked, I ran into a different man who had an influence on my life (fathers of close friends, friends of my parents, my fourth grade teacher). They each made a chalk marking on my arm, and said what it represented (things like perseverance, humor, love, etc). Near top of the hill, a family friend said the last word, and blindfolded me. He lead me to the top of the hill, where my dad read a speech he and my Mom had written. Each man then said a short speech about what their word meant. I recited the poem. I had the marks washed off as ""I already have those traits, this was just to commemorate them."" My dad presented the box. I was turned around to face the ocean sky line as the men all recited a slightly different version of the last line of the poem.

But yeah, I agree with some of the other commenters, in that you should be upfront with what you want and don't want to jump straight to sexting or whatever. I think one of the things that gets them from jumping straight to that conclusion is actually just strike up conversation, ask them on a date, or ask them about hobbies/interests...

Wavooka,asktransgender,1389858428.0,"&gt;As MTF reassignment surgery creates a vagina from the skin of the penis (from what I understand)

Not necessarily. Sometimes the vaginal canal(?) is made from repurposed scrotal skin, abdominal skin or occasionally a segment of colon. (Although the latter has understandably fallen out of favor with surgeons and patients.) 

&gt;I imagine that there may be more issues with yeast/fungal infections in the cavity from moisture?

I recall seeing a paper being passed around that found that the bacterial cultures present in neovaginas to be pretty damn similar to those found in factory installed equipment. Although if I recall correctly, the study found that, on average, trans women reported slightly higher incidences of yeast infections, BV and UTI's. On the other hand, one of the male researchers personally remarked that neovaginas smell 'fishy' as compared to their natal counterparts. 

Unfortunately, my google skills are somewhat lacking and I can't find the study I'm paraphrasing from. Hopefully someone was smart enough to save a reference and will post it here. 

Keeping in mind that this study was from several years ago, that most of the patients they sampled had surgery 10+ years on (IIRC, most surgeries occurred between the 80's and 90's), and that many of them had surgery involving colon segment or other less-developed techniques. I think it is fair to say that, in general, modern neovaginas are similar enough to their natal counterparts. "

Of course, it is always demanded of us by the course of dignity to love people even if you disagree with their lifestyle and even to understand other cultures and even sub-cultures.  This was the way I've pretty much always thought since high school.  

What I was not counting on was some weird ingrained utter disgust by the entire spectacle that I did not know was in me.  It was not something I feared and so cannot be labeled a phobia, but it just made me physically sick to see.  Now, I have seen a lot of weird things online, much of it out of young teenage curiosity or completely on accident, but for some reason the deepest depths of anything worthy of being on 4chan or /r/wtf has never festered in to the kind of shameful reaction I had at that gay pride parade in Chicago.  

I guess I had expected to see just people dressed normal having a parade with more rainbows or something, but there were condoms being thrown at people (which incidentally were expired) and tons more male partial nudity than I thought was legal in public.  I used to think the gay pride movement was about just getting equal legal treatment, but some factions of it seemed to be actively trying to sway people to become gay chanting ""10% is not enough.  Recruit, recruit, recruit!""  I had always heard the message that it is not something you become or a choice.  Well at that very moment I KNEW that I was proud heterosexual.  Nature was sending me a strong message that this was NOT my scene.

I really started berating the whole event and my girlfriend was shocked at my behavior.  I don't remember exactly what I said, but it was a lot worse than the people at the parade really deserved.  

But it really made me wonder if some people who are labeled homophobic are really not so much to blame for their behavior either.  Once all that stuff was in my face for real some kind of psychological change overcame my usual composure and judgement.  I wonder if its just a biological reaction that is healthy for the continuation of our species.

In the end, I did not get to participate in the continuation of the species because I broke up with the girl I really loved, despite our differences, because I thought maybe there was someone out there who I would love more.  I thought maybe we WERE too different in our values and opinions about the world, but since that time I really have not found another person I came to feel such a connection with since.  So maybe I just have one part of that healthy human formula.  Somewhere in the chemical balance of my mind, perhaps I am not quite the perfect tool of genetic continuation as a whole.

Life-in-Death,Feminism,1389858739.0,"I knew you were looking for studies, sorry I should have acknowledged that I was going rogue...

&gt; You could certainly in this case make the argument that the advertiser is objectifying women by using sexualized imagery to sell a product that often has nothing to do with women at all, but on the part of the man looking at the ad, it's probably not about power (or at least it doesn't have to be).

That is exactly the point I was making.  I don't blame the guy for enjoying the ad (though I doubt anyone is connecting a pair of rounds to the person behind it) in this case it would be *whatever* complicated system (e.g. advertisers) that thinks there is a direct link and necessary link between breasts and selling beer that is at fault. Notice the fact that women are beer consumers is also ignored. In this situation, no only is the only thing a woman can contribute to a beer ad is her body (think of how you see men in beer ads for a comparison) but she doesn't even exist in the eyes of the advertiser!  The ads are made specifically FOR males. 

If a man looks at a women and what they see is their bodies as tools to use, that feeds into the problem with objectification.  Objectifying = power.

No one is blaming the ""innocent viewer"" walking by (and enjoying) an ad as the problem."

2edgy420me,WTF,1389858776.0,"I'm just gonna reply to both comments you've made.

One, I said *holes* under the cushions. Like between the fabric where you generally can't get to. Also, I have a huge yard. I live on part of what used to be my grandfather's farm. It's several acres. It's easy to lose them and not find them.

Also, kids can be anywhere at ""stupid hours of the night,"" when they wake up hungry or wake up for the hell of it. They're **babies.** they don't sleep all night. Baby wakes up, you carry him/her with you to make her bottle or whatever, baby drops pacifier, it rolls under your fridge. You're half asleep and clueless. 3 hours later, baby is crying for a pacifier. 

I'm not sure why you're being so condescending about parents and kids losing pacifiers. I'm probably the 5th person to comment and say practically the same thing. Pacifiers are small and given to babies to ""keep up with,"" for the most part. Sure, we can keep an eye on them. For the most part, though, it's on them. They lose them behind things that you can't get behind, (the fridge, they roll behind stoves..etc) they drop them while you're at the store, drop them in parking lots and you don't realize it until they're whining half way home for it. They're small pieces of plastic. You're acting as if we are losing the actual child, or something as large as a basket ball. It's not like they flash with bright ass lights or are easy to find unless they're just in plain sight.

I'm done explaining this to you, though. You've obviously don't have children. If you do, then you're full of shit if you reply and say you do and don't lose them all the time. Or you have them tied around their wrists or some shit. You are just being condescending and snooty for the sake of it. "

C: Sex is about more than the physical feeling, it's about having sex with *that* person because they turn you on, because you care about them, and/or because it is a way for you to express your love for them. 

D: People in relationships still have to worry about pregnancy and STDs. Unless they are monogamous and have been tested, there is no other way to help prevent the spread of STDs. And while condoms are not the only method to prevent pregnancy, they are an option that is best for some people's situations. "

However, in saying that I still must say that I disliked the book as a whole, it was by far the most boring book for me, and I slogged through it to get to the ending. While the ending, and course of events was essential to the book, I don't feel that they were portrayed in the most powerful or effective way.

In short, I guess I would have to say that the third book was my favorite in terms of plot, but my least favorite in terms of execution of said plot. I would chaulk it up to a bit of inexperience in the author taking on some extremely heavy material, but it seems to me that it's more that extremely heavy things like that only really come alive on a page if the person who's writing it has been through it to some degree. 

(Unrelated example of last sentence: I found ""night"" by Elie Wiesel to be much more powerful than the diary of anne frank for this reason. Elie lived through it, and lived long enough to be able to share his story in a way that let all of the true heaviness weigh down, while the diary was discovered by the father, edited and published and the layers of disconnect between the (admittedly inexperienced) author and publication didn't allow it to have the same affect for me.)"

AnotherSmegHead,MLPLounge,1389859368.0,"Once you are seated on the throne of higher-thought, it is hard to imagine lower forms of consciousness, because you are now so aware.  But really, that is the illusion of memory.  You cannot remember a time when you were not conscious at smaller cellular levels, but that does not mean that it is not there in some different way.  Eventually your collective identity is so strong that it becomes singular, but we all know scientifically that we are also billions of little organelles and cells and such.  There is strength in the herd.  Someday in the far future we will take the next step and become multi-people entities.  We already group up in to nations and sports teams, but we are fast approaching a time where people themselves may join collectively in the mind.  We're kind of there already if you think about the fact that men and women have to physically come together to make new life.  They serve separate functions biologically just like different cells.  Its very simple with just two types of human bodies, but its still along those same lines.  

So maybe that is all it was.  Cellular life reached a certain point where the cells developed biological technology that allowed them to function together instead of drifting apart.  Evolving a brain and nervous system was like inventing the Internet is to us.  Cells just came up with many more specialized kinds of cells of the same species.  Its like ants and bees.  They have specialized workers, drones, etc.  They're much more suited to continue the pattern in a way, but humanity is much more compact in that we can do pretty much any job need doing."

Then there was a brother and sister my year, the brother was this derpy guy who always had this dumb smile on his face and would make these stupid jokes, and the sister had no patience for either him or me.

Then, identical twin sisters my year. Both volleyball players, super preppy, couldn't really tell them apart until I actually had a conversation with one of them and then every time I saw them together after that she would smile at me and say hi while her sister glared at me. Then there were brothers a year below me, and one of them was a jock and the other was a nerd, although he was kind of forced to be, since he tore a hip flexor his freshman year of track and spent the next two years in varying degrees of excruciating pain.

If you don't have to expend the energy to grow and maintain two respiration systems you have an advantage over species that do.

Often with questions of why certain traits developed whilst others did not it's often a case of ""that's the way it worked out"" rather than ""this trait developed for this reason"".

There are several other conventions out there for instance in some of them Asia and Europe are considered to be a single continent. In a similar manner European and Latin-American conventions are more likely to the treat the Americas as a whole continent. 

The division of the Americas in North, Central and South is taken in a political, geographical and to some extent historical context. So depending on what convention you adopt, the divisions may vary. The inclusion of Central America into North-America is mostly based on an American convention. I don't dispute that the arguments for that convention  has its merits but far from being common all over the world. It may be common in the US, but the world is a little bigger than that. 

There is also the suggestion that Central America is a subcontinent based on the fact that most of it sits on the Caribbean plate.

thekingsdaughter,poledancing,1389860765.0,"I fucked my shoulder in October because of pole. I got  unlimited classes at my fave school and started classes, going regularly for a month straight. 
One of the problems is that my normal fitness routine had been lacking so I wasn't physically ready for the toll on my body. 

3 weeks into my first month back to pole, after 8 months of no pole and 6 months of sporadic fitness... I come home one day, sit on the bed to lay on my side andsuddenlytherewaspain in my neck.  It shot through my trapezius muscle and so I took a few days off. I iced it but that didn't help. I got a heating pad but that didnt help. I went to the doctor, because my shoulder was tighter and he said it had a hardcore spasm. He wrote an RX for a muscle relaxer and some pain meds and told me not to leave the couch for a week, and no working out for 3 weeks.  Through November, it still didn't feel good enough to work out, especially when it got cold outside, my shoulder used to tense up. Then through December I was either sick or obligated to travel for family stuff... 

So now, I'm starting my routine again. I'm going to beef up and lose some fat before I get back into pole. I think that was one of the reasons my shoulder spasmed, I've lost muscle density the past few years and I've never been under 20% bodyfat. I think weight and strength has a lot to do with it. Swinging around on joints that are never used to supporting your entire weight... its too much.

When I first started pole a few years ago, 2 months in I injured my wrist. I didnt go to the doctor but I think I strained it. I wrapped it up in an ace bandage and after a month it was fine again. The crappy part was that I moved when my wrist hurt so my boyfriend had to carry EVERYTHING since I was basically one-handed. 


TLDR Your shoulder may not be strong enough to support your weight? Even if you're thin, is your shoulder strong enough/loose enough/warmed up enough?

Feroc,DebateReligion,1389860776.0,"&gt; When you start ""clean slate"" without a book as authority, and you argue your way to the truth, that's when there will always be disagreement and consequently a lack of trust in those who might surprise you in their disagreeing morality.

We never start ""clean slate"". We build moral rules depending on the society we live in. So not every person has to make a up complete new set of moral rules. We learn them from the society we grow up in and we are controlled a lot by empathy. Of course there will be disagreements, because morality is not objective! 

Things that were (im)moral 100 years ago don't have to be moral today. And things that are (im)moral may be immoral in 100 years.

&gt; If I told you I follow the bible 100%, and you took that as truth, you would never have to worry about me desiring your woman or lying to you. My free-thinking friend will never regain that kind of trust from me, never in a million years (but I gave him the benefit of doubt for nearly two decades). 

If you would follow the bible 100% I would have to fear a lot more. Like you killing me because I wear two different fabrics or that you'll stone my daughter to death because she wasn't a virgin at her marriage. But I guess the slaves you would own would clean up the mess afterwards."

Simspidey,MorbidReality,1389861512.0,"... what? I'm confused by your question. 

If the law says police may use lethal force in a certain situation, the police are entitled to use lethal force. It's not up to the police about what a procedure is, the discretion they have is very minimal.

A good quote is from the beginning of ""End of Watch"" if you've seen it.

**""I am the police, and I'm here to arrest you. You've broken the law. I did not write the law. I may disagree with the law but I will enforce it. No matter how you plead, cajole, beg or attempt to stir my sympathy. Nothing you do will stop me from placing you in a steel cage with gray bars. If you run away I will chase you. If you fight me I will fight back. If you shoot at me I will shoot back. By law I am unable to walk away. I am a consequence. I am the unpaid bill. I am fate with a badge and a gun. Behind my badge is a heart like yours. I bleed, I think, I love, and yes I can be killed. And although I am but one man, I have thousands of brothers and sisters who are the same as me. They will lay down their lives for me and I them. We stand watch together. The thin-blue-line, protecting the prey from the predators, the good from the bad. We are the police.""**

Now obviously, the discretion in the Kelly Thomas case is what's being questioned. What needs to be PROVEN in court is that the police were in a situation where they had the discretion to take the beating as far as they did. In court it doesn't matter if you agree with what they did per say, rather did they do something they are not allowed to by law.

From what I can guess, the video is actually the reason they got off innocent. Kelly under definition of law is ""resisting arrest"" by trying to get up every time they stop beating on him. Of course, we know this is due to him being mentally handicapped, but in court the police can say they did not know this at the time and claim they just put on more and more force for the longer he resisted. 

Black and white on paper this is completely legal. Someone resisting arrest and not allowing you to put on handcuffs? Use more force. This is most likely the defense used in court.  "

lingual_panda,productivity,1389861593.0,"This is a really serious response to a snarky comment. 

Last summer I started a second job after bartending for a few months. My bartending schedule was 5/6pm to midnight, and while waiting for my second job to start I ended up completely fucking my sleep schedule. Late night jogs, drinking with roommates, staying up to read a novel. I'd go to sleep around 6 or 7 am on some days. I didn't mind though, I had nothing better to do while I waited for paychecks to come in. So I'd sleep in the morning and wake up around 3pm most days. 

When I started my second job, I told myself I'd force an early start one day and with some coffee and many, many alarms, I'd be able to switch back to human hours. 

Not so fast. I was supposed to be at work at 10am my first day, after bartending until midnight the night before. I stayed up to iron my shirt and pants, still couldn't sleep. I think I konked out around 3 or 4 am. And I woke up at 1:15pm. 

After a terrible first day, I did alright for a few weeks. But as my double schedule became more demanding, I started slipping again. I'd wake up one or two hours late at least once a week. Rushing to work in rumpled clothes. Throw in some humidity (my first time experiencing it) and laundry issues (broken washer and dryer) and I'm expecting to be fired any day. And no matter what I did, I couldn't get myself to wake up. I couldn't even hear my alarms. 

After one particularly depressing awakening, I disappear. Don't answer my phone, don't respond to emails. Only for like a day, but still. I finally sent an email about reconsidering my position at the company, and one of the managers agrees to meet with me. 

Luckily it's nearly impossible to get fired in this country so I kept my job and redeemed myself. After dropping some hours and taking it easy for a month, I managed to wake up every day for months. Only one time did I oversleep long enough to actually miss hours at work since then. I thoroughly guilted myself. 

All of this is to say that while it may sound easy to a lot of people, sometimes waking up is the hardest part. Don't gamble with your biology. "
Monosentence,funny,1389861594.0,"Nah. You're just projecting, like an asshole.

One of which was an abandoned stray Maltese, who I ended up taking in till she died of old age.

So on that note, excuse me if I happen to think you sound like a self righteous cunt. God's work? Please. Go fuck yourself. If you actually **cared**, you'd do it for the animals that need it and wouldn't bother trying to impress someone online with your bigoted attitude. Much less treating it like a duty out of grace."

Beastafer,FIFA,1389861988.0,"Alright so I see there is a plight in the land of /r/FIFA that not enough people have contracts!

If you want free contracts and are on XBL go ahead and post here and let me know your situation. I have over 1100 rare and over 2500 non-rare gold contracts and would love to get rid of them.

I don't have the patience to sell all of them (especially at 200 a pop. It's just a shit-ton of clicking that clutters my trade pile) so if you just let me know what's going on I'll PM you with what you should do so I can give them to you!

Sadly at this moment I can't give out coins as well but as far as contracts and advice about FUT: Go ahead and call me your wise Uncle that you see every once in awhile who gives you shit and provides sage wisdom. If you want info about trading, squad building advice, or just want to play me on XBL (shit that part is easy my gamertag is my flair) just let me know!

Edit: To clarify a few things:

1) This deal only goes to guys who need it, and who seem like legit guys. If you've created a profile in under a month, sorry but unless you can prove to me you really need it I'll probably pass you over. No offense, but if it's a fresh day-old account you're definitely getting looked over. 

2) Don't sell these contracts. I could easily make over 500k just off of selling the non-rare contracts alone. I'm really just trying to give back to the community here. If you don't need these contracts please don't ask for them. It goes back to rule 1.

3) Please PM me if you need anything and add me on XBL if you just want to play. I've got a couple guys who just messaged me on XBL if they can have contracts. It's not that big of a deal, but let's use Reddit until I have to use the webapp/XBL to move the contracts.

4) You're only gonna get contracts. Sorry. Like I said: Just contracts, sorry I can't give out fitnesses as well. However, if you need advice on another team to build so then you could rotate teams to make sure you had 100 fitness each game you played with that other squad let me know! I've got a couple good builds and advice if you needed it for you!

Thanks! Love giving back to the FIFA community!"

AFormidableContender,PurplePillDebate,1389862261.0,"&gt;Well don't leave me hanging, explain it to me then.
My understanding is that a nice guy is a man who does favors, buys gifts, agrees with her constantly and is generally ""nice"" to a woman in the hope it will lead to sex.
Apparently this will never work because ""women not virtuous like men""
So I have to conclude from the context that the ""honorable"" thing for said woman to do would be to fuck said guy she is not attracted to.

I didn't posit women are less virtuous than men purely because they are not attracted to Nice Guys^tm but rather making an over-arching commentary on the nature of their general world view and sexuality = hypergamous. Women chase value; that's basically their own desire in life and you can see that in their fashion trends, their media, female culture in general, female subreddits, their sex habits, their attraction switches etc. They have no use for people not at least as socially valueble as themselves. 

In contrast, I personally believe men have a far more robust concept of personal value. A friend of mine growing up whom was extremely extremely alpha had a best friend who was a computer/video game nerd. This guy had a bowl cut, a nasaly voice and was at least 100lbs overweight. In contrast my alpha friend was basically a gangster (had gotten in actual street fights) and had probably the most amazing skills with women I've ever seen (he used to literally tear family members apart...). He liked this guy because he saw something in him that he respected and could have fun with him. He enjoyed exploring dorky things like Dungeons and Dragons with this guy and that kind of shit. 

Women don't don't do this, or at least, have a far lower capacity for this type of behavior in general in contrast to men because the sheer amount of attention, validation an unearned respect they garner by virtue of being born female means they can afford to. 

Why see the value in the beat up old muscle car? Polish it up, show it some love and it could be a great catch with a lot of personality, but why bother when I can afford to buy lambos. I crash it, who gives a fuck? Buy another...

&gt;Is that virtuous?
I didn't ask if desperate men exist, I asked what it is about men that makes their sexual preferences more virtuous.

Men's sexuality is based in one dimension, ""do I respect this package? Does this package validate me? Am I attracted to you? Are you nice? Cool, we're probably good to go then."" 

Women's sexuality is based purely in what she get's out of the economic exchange of validation. Attraction itself, for women, is an economic exchange of validation. Women respect the package only so long as it is the best possible package based purely in physical fitness, social aptitude and economic success. 

Small but hugely important difference. I would posit women don't give a fuck about personality so long as they're being adequately validated. Some would argue men are equally as shallow, and I would agree on the high end. A 9/10 guy is going to be fucking 9/10 women regardless if they're axe murderers or not...if they look hot in a miniskirt, they're good to go. However, I'd argue men are far more likely to go the other way; men can readily be happy with a 6/10 if the 6 makes him feel like a man, and has a great personality. A woman would never take a great personality 6 over an douchebag 9 if she can get 9, and most women can initiate sex with men in superior sexual market values. LTR'ing them is their challenge and so this is what you regularly see.

I do a lot of worldbuilding for its own sake (previously in the fantasy genre).

Working within the rules of Traveller has gotten me really interested in astro-related stuff. I've been spending a lot of time learning about the intricacies of planet formation and the effects that various planetary attributes have on the conditions of the planet.

The idea is very much in its infancy today, but I'm hoping to turn it into some sort of ""lost planet"" to be explored by the adventurers. I know I would be super excited to explore a rogue planet, particularly one with life on it. Imagine how different their perception of the universe might be. It could be aeons before they even realize that there's anything else out there. Our understanding of the cosmos was very much fueled by our observation of the moon, the sun, and other nearby celestial bodies. But to be well and truly alone in the universe, with no stars for parsecs around... That's something else. It really evokes my sense of wonder. :)"

Closest colors out of the tube look like alizarin crimson and prussian blue; for the purple in between, mix those two colors together using much more crimson than blue. Apply each color to its area of the canvas in stripes, then use a big soft brush and VERY GENTLE X-strokes to slowly blend the colors.

i am a feminist and i have zero issue with the very real problems you mentioned being brought up. in fact, i think it's very important to talk about issues that hurt anyone, regardless of gender. 

let's talk about these college tribunals. i agree with you that they are completely wrong. i do not believe that universities should be allowed to handle rape cases. in fact, it is a rampant problem across the US that police and universities are pushing victims to stay away from the CJS and keep it within the school. they do this in order to keep rape statistics low on campuses. it is extremely inappropriate to allow peer boards to decide on cases of rape. i am against this, just like you are! imagine that! 

let's talk about the longer jail sentences. the majority of judges in the US are men. they are the ones that decide the punishments for criminals. if it is largely men that are punishing men at higher rates how is that the fault of feminists? i constantly see this on reddit, and it is something i have never understood. why do you view these issues as a result of purely feminists and take all blame off the men in power?

my issue with reddit's MRM is that it seems to have zero interest in actually helping men (and society as a whole) and just blaming everything on feminism. as a feminist i think men's issues are very important, and that we should be working together to make society better for everyone. "

if you want to save money on the gun you can get an Azodin Kaos for 80 bucks. it has better ergonomics and will perform slightly better than the tippmann model whatever. it is also a fair bit lighter (your arms will thank you) and much easier to maintain thanks to its bolt out back design. otherwise get the GOG eNMEy for 130 which blows all of them out of the water. i know the milsim stuff looks really cool, but the rails on top are the only thing that people actually use. everything else is just dead weight and you will regret having it sooner or later.

Cheese isn't cheating, or morally reprehensible, or anything like that. It just doesn't fall within my definition of a strategy (trademark). It's a gamble, it's hoping that the opponent is unprepared. A strategy based on hope instead of solid foundations doesn't quite ring right in my ears.

It's like saying ""my strategy for early retirement is lottery tickets"". It's perfectly legitimate to make that statement, it's not cheating or anything. It just doesn't feel like strategy to me, it feels like something else. ""My strategy for winning the chess tournament is not showering for 64 weeks beforehand so that the opponent forfeits"" is not a chess strategy, and walling in your opponent isn't starcraft strategy."

Because as whores working under Littlefinger, any money they refused from a client would mean money out of their own pocket to cover Littlefinger's percentage.

So here is my though. It's never really said what Tenzin and Lin's relationship was. 


Here is a situation where things work out for Tokka, even if Sokka is Lin's biology father:

1. Maybe they were like 15 and Aang caught them holding hands or something, and was like ""you're cousins!"" And they're like ""zomg what?!"" And that's all it ever was.

2. Maybe it's not a big deal in the avatar world? Many places around the world, even some US states, first cousin relationships are not as taboo as it is to us.


number 2 seems extremely unlikely, and number 1 is a stretch. My head canon is that Toph had a baby with someone else, and gravitated to Sokka after.

Dinaroozie,FeMRADebates,1389864718.0,"I'd agree that pointing out someone's personal bias is perfectly acceptable. I'm no enemy to the concept of privilege - I think it's often a useful way of understanding the world.

I think trying to categorise a particular phrase as a silencing tactic, or not, is kind of a doomed errand. For instance that Geek Feminism list I linked above lists ""You're the bully"" as a silencing tactic. Obviously, telling someone they're a bully is oftentimes a reasonable thing to do. Sometimes people are bullies, and it's fair to point that out. When Geek Feminism singles out that phrase, they're not saying ""Never call someone a bully"", they're just saying that that's something that can be done unreasonably, and as a way to shut down someone's point of view.

I'm not trying to argue that the concept of privilege ought to be thrown out (I can't speak for /u/123ggafet). I've no doubt that sometimes, ""Check your privilege"" means ""You should consider the possibility that you think what you think because you lack a certain perspective, because of your background"". I also don't doubt that it's used to mean ""People with your background are not welcome to express thoughts here.""

For what it's worth, in my personal experience, I've never actually seen someone tell someone else to check their privilege, in the good sense or in the bad sense, so this is a pretty hypothetical conversation for me. I have, however, seen it used as a pejorative - ""Check out this video of some privileged arsehole talking about &lt;whatever&gt;"" or ""The amount of privilege going on in the comment section of that article is horrifying"" (not actual quotes). Which is fine, I guess - I mean, I've spent time in the company of groups of people way more privileged than I am, and their remarks certainly illicited the occasional eyeroll. However, if some white guy gets into a lot of conversations about gender on the internet, I'm not super skeptical of him claiming that sometimes people use his  privilege as a way of telling him to shut up when they don't agree with him."

BarkingToad,DebateAnAtheist,1389864942.0,"&gt;I feel that the problem is probably my misunderstanding of definitions

Correct. An atheist is someone who does not believe in any gods. That doesn't require knowledge (the only thing I **know** with 100% certainty is that I, personally, exist), any more than believing that my wife loves me, or that dragons don't exist, does. An agnostic is someone who is unsure whether gods exist, but that refers to knowledge, not belief. The definitions are not mutually exclusive, and many atheists refer to themselves as agnostic atheists (myself often included).

Of course, requiring 100% certainty to claim to ""know"" something is dishonest or misunderstood at best. My 99.9% certainty that no gods exist is more than enough for me to say I know, as much as I know anything beyond my own existence, that gods don't exist. I don't require 100% certainty to say that I know three-headed dogs don't exist, why would I require it specifically for god-claims?"

This is how I know you didn't read everything, the links provided stated they had the bodies in a morgue. 

&gt;I'm not saying that every bit of wrongdoing is covered up. But some of it is - we have to be realistic and recognize that the military is comprised of many humans. It doesn't behave consistently or even predictably.

You are somewhat correct in this, any organization is always an extension of the society that creates it, but having served I can tell you that the process of entering it tends to weed out the bad apples, but like doctors, judges, policemen and firemen sometimes they slip through. 

Manning should have never been allowed in the military and should have never been given a security clearance, but apparently he was mentally competent enough to know what he was doing was wrong so he definitely got what he deserved. 

I'm cool with Snowden leaking some of the stuff he did, but he's probably given China and Russia information that could harm us someday, he did it to maintain his freedom and that isn't cool.

Unless maybe after one or two human kills you go completely bonkers, which would be annoying, especially if you're trying to defend yourself.

People who kill on sight probably wouldn't live long enough to see these effects negatively impact their character. When I played the DayZ mod way back when, I maybe saw 2 or 3 guys in total, per character. Maybe this game has changed since then, but encounters were too far and few for this kind of idea.

Plus, from a psychological standpoint, wouldn't killing zombies have some sort of effect on your mental health too? They're not living people, but there is still the sound of their head collapsing as you shoot them, blood being splattered all over you and all of that disturbing nonsense. You'd have to punish the character for killing zombies as well. There is also the human behavior of adaption and being desensitized, if you really want to be realistic.

To me, it just doesn't make sense game design wise AND atmosphere wise. It could work in defeating long term mindless killing bandit characters, but I doubt it would stop Mr. KOS Alive For 20 Minutes from carrying on as normal."

They said 'we'll let the civilian courts deal with this'. The investigation came back with my vindication. I returned triumphantly back to work where I had been before and she was moved elsewhere. It was so obviously phony, her allegation came the day after we signed our performance evaluations and she scored markedly lower than I did and it charred her ass so bad she went to the police department that day and filled a sexual assault case against me. It fell apart quicker than shit because I went to the investigator with a ton of evidence and outlined her motives. Showed him text messages saying she was going to tell people I raped her if I didn't request a transfer. She was convinced the only reason she was evaluated so poorly was because I was turning everyone against her. Sure we never got along but I never paid any attention to her and never mentioned her, she was so insignificant in my mind. She was also a drunk and sent me text messages telling me to stop talking shit or she would tell people I raped her and ruin my career 'who are they going to believe? I've done it before. I don't even have to have any evidence and they will punish you.' The investigator was practically floored by this. She was so drunk she didn't even remember texting me. I had to surrender my phone to the police so they could determine if I had faked the messages. A few days later case dismissed. 

If I hadn't been such a solid performer the chain of command could have easily 'made an example' out of me. It still pissed me off that I showed them the text messages and they said 'well we can't punish her because it might intimidate real victims'. 

She recently got kicked out of the military for stalking me, years later. I knew she was so vindictive that given time she'd hang herself and she did. On a whim I had my electronic medical record audited to see who had been accessing it. Sure as shit she was accessing it to track me without authorization. She could have just let it go and moved on with her life but I knew she wouldn't.

Noneerror,AskReddit,1389865565.0,"OH I have the perfect solution to this and I swear by it! - Vinegar in a spray bottle. As long as you spray the tub down with vinegar once week to once a month (depending on usage) then you'll never have to scrub it.

Spray down your tub 5 minutes before having a shower. Have a shower as all it needs is a rinse. It won't be *clean* yet but you don't need to do any wiping or scrubbing. Next day use a regular mild cleaner. 

This works because the scum you have to scrub is 3 parts- soap residue, mineral residue from the water, and some oil/dirt. The vinegar gets rid of the mineral deposit allowing the rest to be washed away the next time you use shower. If you've left it too long between sprays there can be a strong odor. It's just salt &amp; vinegar and safe. The odor is only strong while it's reacting and after a couple of minutes it loses it's sharpness and just smells like vinegar. That's when you rinse it off.

It's simple, it's cheap ($2 a gallon) and it's much more effective than any cleaner I've ever used. The only time you can't use it is if you have natural stone tiles like marble or slate etc."

He stares at the hand, the icy wind shearing around his him, tousling his hair around his head. The trees rattle their branches at him, like an army clattering their bayonets at an enemy. *What do people normally do in situations like this?*, he thinks, and his mind no longer seems as eager to help him. The wind slices into his eyes and he tears up. He coughs, pulling up his collar around his face, his heart starting to pound. 

""Hello? Is there anyone else out there?"" 

""Hello?!"" He is shouting now, cupping his hands around his mouth, his voice cracking with volume and panic. He suddenly realizes that he is still standing on the hand and recoils in disgust, moving backwards sharply and tripping again, this time on the recalcitrant root of an elm. His ass hits the ground and his tongue catches between his teeth, clarity returning to him with the pain and blood of his tongue. *Use your cell phone, dummy*, he thinks, reaching for it in his pocket as he winces and prods his tongue with one dirt-stained hand. 

The phone sits in his hand, but he can't call. He looks at the hand, barely uncovered at the edge of the path. The leaves and branches around it are clearly disturbed, but there is a large amount of brush piled on top of where he thinks the actual body is, and he does not think that this barely-trail would get enough traffic to notice the brush being piled there intentionally. He would never had stepped on the hand if he had been walking on the normal side of the footpath...*don't you mean HANDpath*, he thinks, and has to bite on his tongue again to prevent giggles that could become more useless screaming for help. 

He inches forward, crawling in the dirt, until the hand is directly in front of him. It is clearly a woman's hand, even without the nail polish as a dead giveaway, and he instinctively reaches out and takes the hand, somehow feeling that he needs to apologize for stepping on her. 

The hand is far warmer to the touch than he expected, and he recoils, gasping, his mouth gaping open in a perfectly natural expression of shock.

AFormidableContender,confession,1389865851.0,"&gt;So TRP tells some men ""you will never be attractive to anyone, so just give up""? 

If that's how your dice roll, yes. 

Women want A, B, and C. If you only have A, or only have B, then you're at a significant disadvantage, and if you have neither A, B, or C, you're fucked. Sorry. 

&gt;Wow, that's really shitty advice, and B and not very helpful. 

It's realistic advice. You only date good looking men with interesting and fun personalities. My above analogy is exactly the same: /u/The_Mermaid only wants A, good looks, and B, a great personality. If you have neither good looks or a great personality, you're fucked, sorry. 

Apply that to most desirable women, and there you go. 

&gt;Pretty much every man will be attractive to some women.

Being attractive to a 1/10 is not useful. There comes a point when neither gender meets the other gender's standards for attraction.

&gt;I have no idea why you think you work twice as hard to achieve the same thing. 

Because I'm not an attractive woman. You are. 

&gt;Do you have some sort of example of this? 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect

I know an employer who specifically only hires good looking women. I know retail stores that specifically only hire good looking women. I have a female friend who was rejected because she wasn't hot enough. Good looking women get graded in schools more easily. Good looking women get jobs they don't deserve. Good looking women get presents from people randomly; the ""cam girl amazon wishlist"" trope etc. 

You got to where you are in life because you are good looking. You have the friends you have because you are good looking. If you were ugly, you wouldn't have those friends. You wouldn't have that apartment/house, you wouldn't have that job, you wouldn't have that boyfriend, you wouldn't have those sexual partners, etc.

&gt;Occasionally, men to out of their way to please me. But it's for minor things, not life-altering situations.

Compound validation is not a ""minor"" thing, it actually has a significantl impact on self esteem and constructive world view creation, especially in young people. 

&gt;I would do stripping if it were my only choice.

So, you're more than willing to take advantage of men for money, and use benevolent sexism to your advantage, but you cry and cry when men do anything even remotely similar? Interesting.

&gt;Do you dislike attractive people in general? You don't seem to have a very high opinion of attractive people.

Attractive men have their faults as well, but no where near as easy a life as women. An attractive men still requires knowledge, skill, and strength of character to make it in many ways in this world. You/attractive women don't.

If the difficult of my life was, lets' say, a 7/10, an attractive guys would be, a 4.5/10, you'rs would be a 2. A 1 if you played you were a bit smart and played your cards right.
 
&gt;I do. And unless you spent time with me every day, and know how I live, you aren't really in a position to claim my life is so easy.

&gt;I do need feminism.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHA6p9PC5JU

You don't need Feminism. Attractive women are the number #1 group of individuals that have unilaterally done really great through out history. Rich white men occasionally had to go die in wars to defend their country....

&gt;I know what society was like before the feminist movement. I wouldn't have the same opportunities. At my age, I'd probably be pregnant and married to a controlling husband, and have no education, job, or even a drivers license, and be completely financial dependent on him.

You're not an inbred hillbilly...you're an attractive, twenty something white chick. You'd be doing just fine....

&gt;It's about ending a patriarchal system. It's up to you if you think that's anti-male or not. In my opinion, no.

The name alone is misandrist. I have no idea how you can argue patriarchy theory isn't misandrist with a straight face.

&gt;I think any system that places 3.5 billion people into 2 categories is a broken system.

Science can place 7 billion people into 1 categoery. is it broken?

&gt;I didn't say sex come easily to everyone. I don't believe in the idea that some people are more valuable than others.

If sex does not come easy to everyone, people must necessarily have differing values. I'm done entertaining your debates on this point. If you disagree, quite frankly, you're really really really stupid, and that's all there is too it. 

You're wrong. I'm sorry, but you're logistically incorrect. 

&gt;I never said I was entitled to handsome men.

Yes you did. You said you were attractive, and therefore, you only date other attractive men.

&gt;If every handsome man in the world suddenly decided to ignore me, I'd be hurt, but my life would go on. I wouldn't date at all though, because I can't date someone I'm not attracted to.

Therefore, you're entitled. You believe if you can't have what you want, the rest aren't worth it and/or are subpar. 

&gt;And men are entitled to preferences.

You sure are. That doesn't mean preferences can't denote entitlement. Entitlement simply always denotes preferences

&gt;The first part was totally wrong. I don't live in a make believe land. Yes, I do believe everyone is equal. 

So, you DO believe in a make believe land...? Cool...

&gt;Our society is messed up and getting worse by the day. Some people might think I'm an idealist because I want to live in a classless, stateless society. But it's better than the alternative.

For women.... 

&gt;I was capable of reading it the first two times you posted it :)

Yet, you weren't capable of understanding it. 

&gt;What do you expect women to do about ""benevolent sexism""? 

Are you fucking shitting me? You did not just say that....Please tell me you did not just say something THAT stupid...

Are you honestly telling me that you believe Feminism has the power to give women the right to vote, but there is nothing women can do about a club charging men $20 cover, but women $5? 

Are you honestly telling that you believe Feminism has the power to give woment he right to have jobs other than being my secretary whom I get to sexually harass without punishment, but there is nothing women can do about the the fact that you can cheat on me, be a crackhead and yet you still get all my shit, my dog, my car, and half my paycheck for 20 years because you were born with a vagina?

&gt;When a guy holds a door for me, I say thank you, and I hold doors for men. Should I instead give him a lecture on why he is being a benevolent sexist? That's not really the most pressing issue in today's society.

That's no benevolent sexism..that's holding the door open for someone...

&gt;The thing is, it's not about what society wants you to look or act like, that's an individual decision. If someone wants to abandon some or all gender roles, that's their right. Personally, I don't fulfill all traditional female roles, especially the ones that expect me to be weak or submissive to men.

If you are happy being an ambiguous nothing creature that no one likes, that's your decision, but feminine women want masculine men and masculine men want feminine women. 

&gt;Women have the same legal rights as they did in 1975, but social status has increased.

No they it hasn't. Women controlled who had sex in 1975, the same way they do now. 

Who gives a fuck about social status?

&gt;Women should have equal economic and political power.

No, women shoulb **EARN**  equal economic and political power, which they haven't done and have no interest in doing, or they'd have it already. Feminsm is trying to convince women they want something they don't actually even want, or they'd have it already. 

&gt;I control my own finances, I don't rely on a man for money. And maybe if more women held political positions, women would have equality worldwide.

This is a none-sense statement that means nothing. Women have no political positions because they suck at politics and they don't want to be politicians anyway. They want to be nurses and school teaches because those are the jobs they enter. No one is stopping you from being a state senator, or President, or governer, or CEO...Unless the evil gender that is men have posted armed guards that follow every woman around making sure you only work where we tell you to work, you're making up bullshit excuses and blaming patriarchy for the fact that you suck at everything men are good at and don't deserve have the rights and privileges you have.  

&gt;How do you make a man ""feel like a man""? I don't even know exactly what that means. It sounds like something I wouldn't like.

You've seriously never asked yourself what a man is? What makes a man a man...? What makes men feel good about being men? *[Sigh]*...of course you haven't. You're an woman. Who gives a fuck about men, right?

http://www.returnofkings.com/category/masculinity

&gt;It's not really a choice in most cases, so why create two separate categories that advertise that some people are more physically attractive than others?

This is a stupid response. I literally asked you if being good looking was better than being bad looking and you're answer is ""people don't decide who is good looking consciously, so why seperate people into 2 groups?"" ....What? We seperate people into groups because people are groupable. There are good loooking people and bad looking people. THere are people you WILL desire and people you WON'T desire. 

There. You grouped them. 

&gt;Contrary to what TRP believes, not all men define their sole existence by their attractiveness, strength, or how much sex they have.

The men who don't, have attractiveness, strength, and the power of sexual selection. Why bother thinking about it when it's handled?"

We've known each other at that point for like 14 years and were friends for nearly as long. Even through we had times where we had not much contact, because our lives drifted apart we still knew if something happened we could count on the other one.

We got into closer contact roughly a year and a half before the incident and hung out every weekend, he is in the military so he only has the weekends free if at all. At some point I met a girl, which later should become my girlfriend. The relationship was horrible and we ended on really bad terms. We had some kind of pause, where she broke up with me just to come back a few days later. What I did not know until I broke up with her because it just didn't felt right, was that on the weekend she had sex with my oldest friend and another buddy of mine, but she told me so.

I freaked out a bit and asked the second buddy first if it's true what she said. He confessed it. All three of them had sex together, so he knew my oldest friend has been there also. When I wanted to confront him about it, he denied it. Even when I said that I knew it and had two confessions he still denied it and made up lies. I then cut all bounds to him.

Now we have contact again. I reattached roughly a year after all that happened, because I didn't want to loose him as a friend completely after all he knows me since I was 5/6. But the friendship is tainted and he knows that. But after all he is a good buddy."

JayMayo,GrandTheftAutoV,1389866315.0,"That's what it was for me in October. I didn't do any of the early glitches like the LSC glitch or the Violent Duct thing. I honestly didn't care about money, I had fun playing with friends. And I did so many survivals and missions that I bought the Elipse apartment and Adder with my own honest money. 

Problem is, I got bored. I had done all the missions, and they're all repetitive anyway, so out of boredom I started messing with the 'jet/tank/buzzard in garage' glitch. And then glitching became more exciting than the game itself, which as far as I was concerned, I had beaten. 

And lately the whole billion thing was also fun cause nobody worried about money again, we all had it, and we just did missions for the fuck of it, we showed up in buzzards, blew everyone up with rocket launchers, we were even starting missions only to 'buy all ammo' and then quit back to Freemode. 

In other words, ALL stages of GTAO have been fun for me. The early legit days, the garage glitching days, and now the billion days. The only thing I didn't do was the DNS thing myself and God mode. Not only was that unfair, but I also didn't want to risk banning. 

Let's hope R* can make GTAO fun again. I think most players would love playing legit if there were still exciting things to do that didn't involve wasting money. "

Yasmin happens to be a higher dose pill, so it does have a bit more of a risk, But its also a very commonly prescribed pill, so there are more women taking Yasmin, and therefore you are going to come across more women with stories about it.

If there is a particular reason you want to take Yasmin over a different brand, you will have to analyse that reason, is it worth the increased risk?

In my case, I was taking a brand called Nordette, which is just as bas as Yasmin. I tried other brands, But nordete was the first to regulate my cycle. It drastically reduced my pelvic pain, Period length and flow and PMDD symptoms. Compared to other brands that did not change my naturally long irregular periods, and left me with my normal debilitating pain, I came to the personal decision that the increased risk from Nordette was worth the quality of life I was getting.

If there are other, lower dose formulations you are yet to try, and Yasmin's notoriety scars you, consider giving all other formulations a try first."

For all intents and purposes we've proven that LSU is better than Bama (obviously not because lf the NCG but my point still stands).

That's why it was so close in the voting and came down to the wire, because half the field voted on quality of loss, and the other half voted on the matchup they hadn't seen.

The carbonic acid is the cleaner. You are using an acid to scrub with grit. You are giving it a form of short sandblast. It does a lot to help clean. The remaining paste has it's uses too because it's a gritty paste. I wouldn't mix it in advance but the actual reaction is an effective cleaner.

She also prays and she has given me the one single explanation of praying I've ever heard which makes sense.

That's it. No creationism. No spewing archaic bible verses. No abstinence or sanctity of marriage etc. That's pretty much as religious as I've ever seen a person be (whom I've actually known). She believes in the personal god and uses her beliefs as motivation to simply help and reach out. As an atheist, I can really accept this kind of religiousness because it does actual good and isn't hateful. 

But I digress. So no, I haven't really met the classical religious type we see in popular culture. Of course, I've only ever lived in the capital and kept to hanging out with highly educated people. If you move out into the countryside you would probably find real Christians. But since I've never met these, I simply don't know the standard ""religious morals"" type.

candydaze,TwoXChromosomes,1389866931.0,"As I said, if you're only using that term to distinguish between photoshopped images and ""natural"" images, then I'm totally ok with that term, and I'd like a world without photoshopping people in media images. 

However, you (or Aerie) need to make that connection extremely clear - the term ""real women"" and ""real girls"" has been thrown around inappropriately for long enough now that it has some nasty connotations that will hurt the self esteem of some people. For example, a slogan that reads only ""Aerie - real girls"" under a picture of the models you describe may have a very different impact to ""Aerie - real girls, not photoshopped"", as the first can be seen to link in to all the other connotations of the phrase, while the second makes the position clear. 

Story time: I once made a comment in an Askreddit thread, which had got on to a news item (with photos) about some women celebrating their right to go topless in NY, by going topless. Of course, some people whinged that the women weren't that good looking, so I made a comment along the lines of ""that's what real people look like, so get over it"", meaning that they weren't the touched up images fed to us by the media. But it still managed to offend a lot of people, and make them feel hurt. So since then, I've always been careful about using that phrase, because people might not interpret it the way I mean them to.

mundabit,birthcontrol,1389866966.0,"As far as ease of use goes, The Implant or the IUD are the next easiest things compared to Depo. However these methods can cause spotting or irregular bleeding.

the good news is that the hormones in the Mirena/Skyla IUD, Implant and Depo are 3 different hormones, so just because Depo hasn;t helped, it doesn't mean the other two wont, and if you try the Implant and its no good, there is still hope that a hormonal IUD will help, and if all else fails, there are non-hormonal IUD's too.

But if you want something that will really manage your period and bleeding, and give you full control, you are going to need an oestrogen method. The patch and the ring are easy to use, but tehy do require more interaction than the progesterone methods.

Out of all these methods, I would recommend looking into Implanon/Nexplanon. I know it can be a bit squeamish to picture something inserted, But its 100% painless to both get it in, and out, it takes less than 5 minutes for both procedures. Its a lot less fuss than trying to get an IUD in (and the Implant goes in the arm, not the uterus, so there is no strings attached- literally) You can get it taken out the same day it goes in if you hate it that much. It will give you 3 years of hassle free birth control, and in those 3 years you only need to make 2 appointments. One to get it in, and one to get it out."

AnJu91,philosophy,1389867284.0,"&gt; To reiterate, his use of the term 'state of matter' is simply to explain the semantic and referential status of 'consciousness' in relation to Tononoi's 'phi.' It is not meant to be a physical analog

Indeed, this title is extremely misleading, **consciousness is per definition by Tononi's ITT *not* a state of matter, but a state of a *system*.** 
I haven't gone through the paper yet, which I'll do later, but I feel this paper has a strong misconception about what consciousness really is, and plays around too freely with the concept.
 
Consciousness within psychology is about awareness and an ineffable subjective experience, quite distinct from several problems stated at the beginning of the paper which are more about how we internalise external reality and how the universe is connected with eachother. 
 
I feel the paper is more about information theory and complex dynamics that can occur in any system that has a hierarchical and interconnected nature, much less about consciousness like that of the human mind. Consciousness and quantum mechanics are both extremely complicated and counter intuitive fields, and I think this is apparent in the very misinformed blog article about the paper. Consciousness is most likely not dependent of quantum effects, despite the appeal of such theories. 

It is however, very intriguing to expand ideas from consciousness to physics, but personally I think this is more due to the enormous potential that information theory has on understanding the world and mind. In fact I dare say this paper is much more about understanding (physical) systems in terms of information theory than consciousness. The usage of the concept consciousness seems more due to its appeal of 'magic-ness' and sensation than the appropriateness.

little_shirley_beans,AskReddit,1389867833.0," A few months ago my boyfriend and I were at a Popeye's Chicken for their waffle-fried chicken. This particular location is an older one in a predominately ethnic neighborhood and everyone in the restaurant was either black or hispanic and my boyfriend and i are very white. Being so old the decor is straight out of the 70's or 80's with everything in shades of browns with some yellow and orange. All of the pictures were of chicken or mashed potatoes, so not a whole lot of diversity in the color scheme.While we were standing near the register waiting for our order, my boyfriend, without thinking, notices the color scheme and turns to me and says ""man, everything in here is brown!"" Right behind him was a larger black man who just gave us a death stare, thinking that he was talking about the racial makeup of the restaurant. Luckily I understood that he was talking about the food and decor so I was able to save it by saying ""well... they have green beans and sweet corn..."" Thankfully, the other man understood then, but I sure gave my boyfriend a lot of shit for that! "
derleth,TumblrInAction,1389867833.0,"&gt; but the meaning, to advance women's social status, is still standing.

First-wave feminism wasn't about black women. It wasn't about gay women; in fact, the progressive attitude of the time was that homosexuality was a disease, which would have made the feminists of the era extremely homophobic by today's standards.

The fact is, the movement changed, and the definition of the word changed along with it. Insisting that the change didn't happen, or that it must stop happening, is pointless. It is at odds with reality. You might as well try to sweep out the tide.

&gt; A movement is not a verb or thing, subject to multiple meanings

That said, 3 Mbps is a fairly standard speed for cheap cable and fiber optic plans. 15 Mbps is a bit more expensive.

(To clarify: ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) is a purely digital phone service, with digital voice and digital data on the same phone line, carried using digital modulation. DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) is essentially analog, with voice unchanged and digital data transmitted as high-frequency analog tones in parts of the spectrum the voice band isn't allowed to use. This is why DSL lines need splitters and filters: To protect the two frequency bands from each other better. ADSL, the most common form of DSL, is Asymmetric DSL: More frequency bandwidth is allocated to download than to upload, leading to a vast disparity in download speeds compared to upload speeds. Pretty much only businesses get plans with equal download and upload speeds.)"

1) You're going to be extremely busy for the next 6 - 7 years.  I'd like to think I'm low maintenance, but I might want more of your time then you could give.  

2) Money. Debt is never attractive, it's not necessarily a deal breaker, but i'd want to know that you've thought through the financial implication of your decision. Further, it doesn't sound like you'll have much discretionary cash over the next few year. If I want to europe for example, you might not want to spend the money to come with, and so I'd have to decide whether to pay for your trip. I'm not rich, but I'm not interested in living like a student again.

3) Marriage/kids. For me personally, kids are something that I want and if I were to get into a serious relationship with someone we would need to be on the same page about that.  If you plan to be in school until your late 30's, you might not be on that page

The stretched mode only really works for games where the focal point is right in the middle, so driving games and shooters work well.  RTS and sim games (like civ5 or starcraft) do not.

Tiseye,SRSWomen,1389868495.0,"Well, proof in many European jurisdictions is not the same as in the US. It's not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

Furthermore, as I understand Swedish law, even consensual sex can be considered rape if the perpetrator used force or the threat of force (and he admits he used force, he just claimed that he thought she liked force).

In the absence of force or the threat of force intent of the perpetrator comes into play.

He used force. He admits using force. He admits he hits her and subjected her to acts of sex she objected to. The judge in this case could very easily have ruled against the perpetrator under law as the perpetratof used force and admits to using force.

The one thing that makes Swedish rape laws the ""outcast"" in Europe is precisely the thing this judge could have used to take the perpetrator's admission as proof. Swedish rape laws are framed in the use of violence."

I CS because I love to travel, meet new people and get free accomodation :P but i'm always respectful of my hosts and guests and I go into it for the experience.

To be honest in general when I'm looking to surf I will send more requests to females than males. But that's is NOT because I'm looking to hook up or find potential relationships. It is because in my life in general I tend to get along with women better. 

So far I've surfed 7 times, with 5 being female hosts, and I have hosted once, a woman. All of them were enjoyable experiences. One of them *did* turn sexual, but it was her whom initiated it. I'm far too respectful to 'try' anything, even if I find my host/guest attractive.

I was saying that if Farage won he would most likely deport EU nationals from UK (as his manifesto point suggests), meaning this would be a kind of a racism behaviour as he specifically targets a certain group (EU nationals) without taking into account ANY defensive grounds, for example fact that those immigrants could have established in UK fully and at this point legally.

Some other guy, whom I refused to discuss said ""it is a privilege"" to live in UK and if Uk suddenly changes rules because of some nationalist moron like Farage, then so be it, deport all EU nationals who have settled here legally.

Do you still think it's OK and cannot be put under racism behaviour?

P.S. I know I may be going a bit too far as racism is generally about particular race and EU nationals are not really a race... however looking from the context even an academic would admit that is some form of racism as UK (no longer being within EU) would discriminate EU nationals, solely on the fact of their countries of origin."

tauntology,belgium,1389869036.0,"When I learned about the whole brony-thing, I watched a few episodes of the show to see what it was all about. Research :D

The narrative is fairly classic. Easily recognizable characters that appeal to us instinctively with easily recognizable, but fairly benign, flaws. The same content you find in many sitcoms, like friends. 

The stories themselves are full of easy jokes and good values. It is the perfect escapism. You know the conflicts will be solved and nothing will change permanently. Plus, there are tons of visual gags that happen in seconds and are often unimportant to the story. They peak the attention of the viewer so that his attention never wanes. 

The artstyle is quite stylized and very colorful. If this had been (like the original series) very girly with extra frills and lace... bronies would probably not have been a thing. 

Lastly, the pilot episode was absolutely brilliant. It was the start of an epic quest with fantasy elements, magic, strangers becoming friends, the defeat of a great evil... If you cast Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood etc. you have lord of the rings. 

That perfect mix of good narrative, escapism and style makes it highly enjoyable for a few episodes. I had enough after those few episodes but I understand why this became people's guilty pleasure. "
thecupcakedragon,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,1389869037.0,"I got terrible cramps when I started the pill, it was unbearable. Went to my doctor, she said it was estrogen withdrawal. As long as I take a painkiller (aspirin is my favourite) when I first feel it coming on, I'm fine :) I guess what I'm trying to say is be prepared for a couple months of adjustment. 

As for your mother (but dont say it to her): She's being absolutely ridiculous. Pull out is *not* a reliable form of birth control and should not be depended on unless you are in a position to raise children with your partner should it fail. Also, why on earth would you leave *your* risk of pregnancy in someone else's hands?!As for condoms, there is no reason you can't use condoms in conjunction with birth control (two forms are better than one!).

When I went on the pill (at 16), my mother was worried about me having trouble conceiving later in life because of the pill. I cant tell you whether or not that's a valid problem, it's not something I've had to encounter. 

But, on the other hand, isn't it better to have trouble getting pregnant later (when we have all this technology to assist and thousands of orphans who need a home) than have an unplanned pregnancy ruin your life now? There is also no guarantee you'll even have a problem!

At the end of the day, remember it is your choice. If you want to go on the pill, don't let anyone talk you out of it (except maybe medical advice from your doctor, and even then ask about your other options). I don't think any mother is *thrilled* to hear their child has decided to go on it, but its something that should happen sooner or later. If you think you may need it, go for it!"

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,WTF,1389869686.0,"I  understand what you are trying to say. And while twerking isn't exactly my favorite dance craze, I will say I believe there is more to it than meets the eye. I took an african dance class in college, and most of these moves are deeply based on it. You have to do these deep squats and stick your ass out and while moving your hands and that symbolized picking the harvest. Some most the dancing had very suggested pelvis thrusts throughout, again often depicting normal life activities. And sometimes they reflected sex, because that is also a normal life activity. Now, I doubt these girls know the roots of their dance moves, but they are obviously beginners. It takes a lot more practice to isolate your ass muscles to do some of the moves I have seen. But for beginners they did tons of moves there is not way in hell most of us could pull off. Again, I tried many in african dance, and they may look simple but they are not.

Second. Dance has always been about sex. The Waltz was banned from many establishments because they deemed it to sexual since dances stayed with one partner for the entire dance. Everything I've ever seen on Dancing with the Stars, from lombada to whatever else they have has basically been simulated sex. It's kind of the point of dance. They can tell stories, but most stories are about relationships and sex. 

I think it's odd that I've received two people talking about these girls were obviously doing it for the guys, when I only saw maybe 6 guys in that entire place. All of them were girls. It was the girls who were cheering, and to me (a female) it seemed like that was really who they were trying to show off to. If there were a gym room full of /r/fit and they decided to put on some jams and have a muscle off contest with 50 guys and 6 girls, who do you think they would really be showing off to? The guys. Yeah, they'd be psyched for the chicks to check them out, but really they are showing off to their fellow men who know how much work they've put in. They are showing off to their peers.

silverionmox,europe,1389869706.0,"&gt; That's not exactly certain at this point. There still could be a massive debt write off.

Previous debt writeoffs focused on the private part of the debt, so they've been safeguarding their interests pretty well so far.

&gt;In fact, I would think that cancelling large amounts of debt to periphery nations in an inevitability. Maybe the Germans just want to improve their books and save as much money as possible before this happens? I'm not sure, but the situation is complex and nuanced.

I don't think that's a solution: it would endanger the balance of many banks in the core, requiring assistance through the support of banks. Ultimately, the only solution is to use the ECB: either as a provider of liquidity of last resort, or to generate inflation to erode the debt away.

&gt;I don't think one country alone is solely responsible for the issues in the EZ. It is a complex confluence of a number of factors coming together simultaneously.


Of course, but it's well known that the German aversion of inflation is something particular to them, and the Bundesbank was the model of the ECB, after all.

&gt;Yup, I agree they should. But there is only so much they can buy. What are Greece and Spain selling that Germans a)would want and b)cannot make for themselves. The only country I think of that would benefit substantially from Germany expanding domestic consumption is Italy, since it has a strong and well established industrial base.

All neighbouring countries would, so half of the Eurozone - and non-eurozone - would benefit, and southern Europe is still a popular holiday destination, so they're bound to enjoy the recovery of any part of Europe a bit."

Pornography is not made to be politically correct or fit the perfect standard of sexual portrayal. It has one sole purpose, to make money. Like any other entertainment industry within a capitalistic society, these people are just doing what they know works and will sell the most. Hollywood has been recycling the same four stories since the 50's and now Video Game companies are doing the same. 

You know what ends up being the most revolutionary games? Independently created. Newest stories in movies? Independently filmed. Most realistic pornography? Couples doing it for fun.

[Genetic drift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift) is the other major player in a species' evolution, and genetic drift sometimes leads to the proliferation disadvantageous traits via the founder effect and bottlenecks (though I'm pretty doubtful that genetic drift explains human homosexuality).

It's also important to remember the physical complexities of DNA, such as chromosomes. If two unrelated genes share the same chromosome, it can lead to one gene being selected for indirectly. Say, for example, blond hair confers a major advantage and blue eyes confer a minor disadvantage; we should expect to see a proliferation of blue eyes, despite their lowered fitness, simply because blue eyes and blond hair correlate strongly with each other due to sharing the same chromosome."

silverionmox,AskReddit,1389870550.0,"&gt; The guys who actually design and build it are paid for their services, their ""share"" is their fee. 

And who decides what share they should get? That's where the power lies. The question is, why should an owner, who spends a variable amount of his resources on it, but typically just a tiny fraction, have more power to decide the distribution of the rewards than the actual producer who spends much of his time on it?

&gt;whether it has a mortgage for most of it or not is irrelevant because if it does it's the guy who signs the line whose assets are on the hook if they can't make the payments.

A worker who commits his time to work at that enterprise is in much greater trouble if he doesn't get paid. Even if he gets paid, he was committing all of his working capital to that job and is at a much higher risk than an owner who sees one of his many investments underperform or fail.

The accumulation of ownership is unlimited, and it can be spread out almost indefinitely. Owners have much more options for risk management, it's not a deal between equals.

&gt;As to the person who simply uses what someone else risks their time, money, and often labor for? Why should they get for free what they have not labored or risked to obtain?

You overestimate the owner's risk, as explained above. If it was that risky, they would sell it.. bringing down the price of housing and solving the housing problem in another way.

&gt;Nothing exists in a vacuum and nothing is free, it all has costs in human time and effort that must be paid

Kethane changes the way you can play the game. Certainly, it's possible to fly to any planet with all the fuel you need for a round trip but using the Kethane mod, you can go one way, harvest, process, and refuel in situ and fly back. Not necessarily better or worse, just different.  
Kerbal Engineering Redux (KER) or MechJeb both give a lot of useful flight and construction data. MechJeb also includes autopilot functions that can make tedious jobs less of a hassle and allows some very precise fine tuning of orbits but it's not always the most effecient at some tasks (like docking) and can behave oddly at times.  
RemoteTech2 adds the requirement (when using RemoteTech parts) for a communications relay network to be constructed for unmanned missions. It can be fun and challenging to set up a robust, efficient network but can also be very tedious when you have to launch multiple, identical satellites into the same orbit at specific phase angles to maintain global coverage on a celestial body.

clairebones,programming,1389870673.0,"&gt; hostile work environments which I think anyone would agree is a problem but I would expect it would be a problem with individuals or organizations rather than the field or culture surrounding the field

Unfortunately in my experience this is not the case, at least not in the UK or parts of America. It's a *very* pervasive attitude that exists in the universities and colleges, the majority of workplaces and the social activities and groups connected to the field. It is so common that a lot of guys just don't see it because they consider it 'normal', but it really can be difficult to be part of that culture and be female. 

The question shouldn't be 'why should I recruit females', because the point is, why shouldn't you already be recruiting females? Why should we have to be having this discussion? There are significant problems for women in tech that need to be addressed, and the idea that people shouldn't hire women because they don't bring something 'special' is the problem - they are already just as capable as men, so why aren't they being hired on that basis?"

I'll only turn him down if there are pressing circumstances (like if I'm on a strict deadline, late for work, or very ill). But I'm usually pretty passive and boring in bed in these cases...I'm not going to get all theatrical and pretend I'm into it if I'm really not, and I don't even bother trying to have an orgasm. I tell my bf he should think of it less as sex, and more as masturbating with my pussy. He knows what's up because I'll tell him 'just use my pussy to cum, this one's just for you' and then he knows not to do any foreplay or draw it out, and so he'll just stick it in and cum quickly.

Obviously he would prefer it if I made my usual effort, but it's a decent compromise for the times when he wants sex and I'm not in the mood. I guess he appreciates the 24/7 access to my pussy, even if it's not always the most thrilling ride of his life. Plus, we more than make up for it the times when I actually am in the mood.

* Monday: had sex at night
* Tuesday: ""I'm still sore from last night, so we can't really do our plan.""
* Wednesday: I come home and she's passed out on the couch, suffering from a crippling headache.  Needless to say, no sex.

Public sector.  Not sure on their disability policy.  I had a few sick and personal days.  In the termination letter that I received it stated that I did not qualify for FMLA and how many sick and personal days I had.

I went in for a check up on Thursday before I was to go into work.  While at my appointment, the doctor noticed that my blood pressure was super high, so instead of letting me possibly have a stroke or seizure, he admitted me to the hospital for an initial 24 hours observation.  I sent a text to my manger letting her know the situation and that I wouldn't be in to work, obviously.  I let her know that they told me I wasn't leaving the hospital pregnant and the progress of my treatment and if I was getting any better/worse.  I let her know that I had the baby on Sunday.

My child came about 3 months early, which I'm pretty sure threw everyone for a loop.  In my termination letter they mention my sick/personal days available and when  I last worked, so proving that I was fired for the baby might be impossible, but I think I will contact an attorney for a free consultation.

richardjohn,london,1389871743.0,"Do you think that the art, music, and culture that makes London a desirable place to live comes from the middle class young professionals? No, we generally add nothing culturally, and so rely on the people who are being pushed out. When the last of these people are pushed out, when the last squat is evicted and the last social housing disappears from zone 1/2, what are we left with? One giant Clapham.

London has always had social housing alongside private housing, even in the most expensive areas you can see the tower blocks (unfortunately now filled with privately owned flats) built in the 60s. You might think that's incompatible with capitalism, but we're not America; we're not yet a pure capitalist state.

Social housing stock has been depleted for various reasons, and it's not being replaced. These new developments that squats are holding up don't have a certain amount of social housing, they have a certain amount of ""affordable housing"". Often this is flats to buy under a shared equity scheme — more easily affordable than the rest of the flats, but still *far* out of reach for the people who've been displaced. "

Personally, I don't really like the idea of using WebViews as the main content provider for an application, as it's not much different from just using a browser on your phone, but as you said, it makes it far easier for everyone to contribute.

I do believe however that a well implemented/designed native application would be best. Making the application as atomic as it gets should let it be easily modifiable by everyone without the need for webviews.

That being said, I have nothing but respect for /r/elxx. The Battlelog application is very functional and disregarding slowdowns, it's very good.

I've never heard of Frostbite go. A quick google search brought me to Frostbite's page where it said Go is a mobile game engine. Battlefield Mobile anyone?

Noneerror,AskReddit,1389871877.0,"Professional housecleaners do things differently because there is either no personal items at all (hotel maid) or they don't touch the personal items that comprise the clutter (house keeper). The personal items such as paperwork, and piles of junk that should be put away are what's really making it messy. Pros touch the grime, with only limited impact on the clutter.

Here's stuff that pros do that applies to everyone:

* Always clean top to bottom- high stuff before low stuff. From dirty to dirtier. Floors last.

* Start in one location and move in a radius from spot fully cleaning each location before moving to the next. Don't get distracted by the rest of the room and don't put anything back on spots cleaned unless it belongs.

* Use rags rather than paper towels. Ripped up old towels etc. Dirty rags are saved and washed later. New room type, new clean rag. IE don't use the same rags you used in the kitchen in the bedrooms or bathrooms. Never clean the bathroom then the kitchen. Don't cross contaminate.

* Vinegar is your friend. If you think your friend stinks then change the smell by adding citrus or a drop of perfumed soap. It's cheaper and more effective than many commercial cleaners. Doubly so in the kitchen and bathroom. If you need rubber gloves for routine cleaning then you are using chemicals that are too harsh. Windex, Mr Clean and vinegar account for more than 90%.

As a bachelor here's what to do-

* If it's a bedroom; start with and *make the bed* including clean sheets. This is not so the bed is made. It's no longer a bed. It is now a large flat work surface. You can put stuff onto the bed temporarily for things that are going right back where they came from like your alarm clock or lamp.

* If placing something on the bed would make your bed dirty then *clean it first* and then put it on the bed, or put it in it's proper place or throw it away. Cleaning your sheets first keeps you honest about what's clean and what's dirty.

* You watch TV? Pick a one hour program each day to tidy up during the commercials. Focus on throwing away trash and put things in their proper place. You can accomplish a lot in those 15 mins a day."

crankypants15,AskMen,1389872743.0,"&gt;  I don't want to hurt his feelings or anything. Here's my frustration/worry: I am very motivated and he is not.

First, he needs to be able to talk about his weaknesses like an adult. So talk to him to determine if he even has the potential to talk about these things. 

Second, this is going to be a source of constant frustration for you if you two get married, is it not? 

&gt; He keeps saying he's going to get a better job, save for a car and go back to school, but the fact is I've known him for almost a year now and nothing has changed and he has not done any of it. I'm getting really tired of driving everywhere. Are my concerns are off base?

You're not off base. He talks but doesn't do. You're just starting to see how your incompatibility can cause some serious problems. As an older divorced person, I recommend you two never marry. 
I have the experience to know this is quite a serious issue in most cases. I'm not going to say he's a loser, but I will say *he's not right for you.* I wish my parents would have said that about my first wife. 

Let me give you another example of me and my SO. She has a college degree but doesn't use it. She has a low paying job, but makes up for that by working harder in the house. And she puts a lot of effort into our relationship. So I'm ok that her pay is pretty low. We can still pay the bills if we get married. 
We might sound very different in the job area, but money isn't everything to me, I don't mind if she earns much less than me, we can still pay our bills, and she is a really nice person otherwise.

My mom started the talk with me when I was 10 too. She started out with what changes were going to happen to my body, and why. I think finding out what your daughter knows is a great way to start too. 

The best piece of advice I can give you is for you &amp; your wife to tell your daughter that you will love her no matter what and never judge her, that your door is always open for her and she can come to you with questions without fear of repercussions. My mom established that relationship with me, and I was never afraid to talk to her about anything. Any question I ever had, I asked her and received an age appropriate answer. When I was ready to start having sex, she and I talked about it, she took me to the gynocologist and I got on the pill, as well as used condoms. Her non-judgemental open door policy made me comfortable enough to stay open and honest with her. She wasn't happy I wanted to have sex but she knew she couldn't stop me, so she did the best she could to protect me from STDs or teen pregnancy. 

Talk to her, of course, and let her know its okay to talk to you too. I think that is a really important thing, that she feels she can trust you and your wife."

* Muslim appeasement

ta1901,AskMen,1389873242.0,"1. My dating life got better when I started figuring out what I really need in a relationship. 
2. I started asking dates for what I wanted, and usually got it. If they were not compatible with my needs, I moved on. No sense wasting time there. 
3. I realized I could not be all things to all people, so I no longer took it personally when a girl broke up with me. Life happens. I can't please everyone. 
4. If you think you know about healthy relationships you're wrong. It takes two people to make a relationship work, and only one to screw it up. 
If one person is not committed it will not work. 

&gt;  I've noticed that out of the 14 or so girl's I've liked only 1 has actually agreed to go on a date with me.

Many younger girls are not ready to date. This has nothing to do with you. Also, many young girls who are ready to date are hung up on status, and that means they only date guys with good looks, or money, who increase the girl's social status. While this is not your fault, it still affects you. Try not to take it personally. And yes, even in the 1980s I went through this exact same thing. Apparently this part of the culture has not changed. 

Generally, you have to ask 10 girls out before you  get a ""yes"". That's just par.

oldmonty,tf2,1389873486.0,"Spy main here, the problem most people make with spy is that they think the disguise will fool the enemy team regardless of circumstance. I was guilty of this as well when I first started and I kept getting destroyed. 

It can be true if you are extremely lucky but the proper way to play spy has to account for the fact that the majority of players are going to be cautious and checking for spies constantly. Playing spy involves a lot of flanking and out positioning your enemies, then you have to take advantage of openings where the enemy is distracted. The disguise simply wont fool the enemy for an extended period of time, anything past 5-10 seconds is pushing it. The disguise serves another important function though, which is fooling a player's peripheral view. 

If I walking right at you, you are obviously going to think I'm a spy but if I position myself properly you wont even see me, if something goes wrong or there are multiple people on the enemy team thats where a disguise can come in handy. 

All I need is the ""oh that guy's blue"" confirmation when the player sees me in the corner of his vision. The player shouldnt have time to think what an eng is doing way out there. That should be a big enough opportunity and if I was red when he looked, the player would immediately turn to try and blow me up. Tf2 has trained players to immediately react to colors pavlov style, blue is ok until you look close but red is immediate attack. 

Taking advantage of distracted players is your best strength, oh they saw an enemy and turned to chase them down for 1 sec, thats more than enough time. Most of the time when you are playing tf2, your mind is on a set track of what you need to do at any given time i.e. I'm going to attack those guys, I really need to get that health, I need to take out that medic before he ubers, etc. A spy is most devastating when he interrupts that train of thought, ""oh I need to get that health, I'm right on it, ohh cmon give it to me, boom-backstab"" and bring on the rage. 

The worst time is when there is no set thing to do and a player's mind can wander, i.e. I'm just gonna walk to mid and find the enemies, better make sure there's no one behind me. You have no idea at what point during a player's walk they will have this thought, this is what brings randomness to the spy's life, the way people think. Its terrible for the spy because spy is a completely opportunistic class. Oh I did everything right and am in perfect position lets get this stab... nope the player derped and I ended up in front of them. 

Remember, if you are playing spy, you *are the* spy, you are the double agent, the ghost, the splinter cell, the hitman. You cant be seen and you will wait until the exact opportune moment to wreck the enemy. That guy has less than 100 health- shoot him in the face, less than 50-dont even bother aiming shoot the body. That heavy has a medic healing him and just spun up to wreck a bunch of your team mates, jump down from the rafters and insta-kill him leaving the medic shit out of luck. 

The best thing you can do for your team is introduce chaos, so the enemy doesnt know where the next attack is coming from, anyone could be it, any corner could be hiding death. Make them so busy checking that they are distracted when your team mates come in putting them at a disadvantage, then when they scramble to try and rally because none of them were ready, clean them up. 

Edit: [A good example of the type of devastation I was talking about](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwbRFryGrPc&amp;t=1m21s) if you are looking directly at that part of the screen the sniper is clearly a spy but from the point of view of the medic who was focused on something else its quite startling and confusing. Plus the whole time they are dealing with that nonsense the medic isnt healing or helping the team push, 3-4 distracted players for the price of one can mean quite a lot in quelling a push. At 2:18 the spy repeats the maneuver and it works on everyone except the medic who was freaking out being cautious about him. "

predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them. 

Ok, so if a hetero guy carries the gene, but does not express that gene, does that make him better at mating or attracting women somehow? All I know is quite a few women tend to like manly guys who also are confident expressing their 
emotions appropriately. 

Does a guy have to be gay or bi to be confident expressing his emotions? Not really, but IME, ""really straight"" guys are also not prone to expressing their emotions, because they may be simply less emotional. 
There may be a physical or cultural reason for them being less emotional.

Don't sleep with him! Don't hope he will change his mind! For the most part, if you want to be in a relationship with a guy, and he does with you, he will ask you out on dates, and you will accept, or you will ask him out on dates and he will accept.

Dantilli,introvert,1389874208.0,"Remember, if you get really anxious or embarrassed in a social situation, **that has nothing to do with your introverted nature**. It is purely just anxiousness that can be overcome and eventually be eliminated completely (in most cases).

So if ya do start feeling awkward/embarrassed/anxious just know that if you try and push through it you'll be working towards ridding yourself of it. It is NOT a permanent state.

as for how to cope... I have 3 strategies: 

* I personally keep in mind the above and I can get through anything. Just knowing that pushing through my anxiety will help me improve in some way means I can make myself do anything.

* Remember that everyone is doing it and therefore no-one will judge you, they'll be too focussed on how stupid they feel. I know people say that in every situation, and I almost always disagree with this idea. I'm ridiculously conscious of other peoples actions and stuff so the ""they won't care"" argument just doesn't work for me (plus it's not a great state of mind to have imo). But in this circumstance it has truth, as the idea of the exercises is to focus on what you are doing. So the ones who are a bit shy will be terrified of how stupid they look and the others will just be focussing on themselves therefore no-one will be paying ANY attention to you as long as you participate.

* Finally, think of the reason you are doing it, think about what you'll get out of it, what the exercises are designed to do. I think part of them is to actually try and get rid of anxiety so you can feel free and not at all awkward on stage. But whatever the reason, if you understand WHY you should do something it makes it much easier to go through it (obviously, if you don't know why, ASK!)."

People will still complain speedrunners can do content significantly faster than they can, and complain about the new META instead. And, nothing will have changed.

Critical damage gets a hit? Condition damage gets boosted? Great, now the speedrun teams will simply run a condi necro or engineer and 4 direct DPS characters instead, essentially moving closer to the trinity system, because now you'll 'need' certain classes with certain specs to be optimal. As it is right now, 7/8 classes can perform incredibly well in a speedrun setup, with the exception being necro due to lack of melee cleave.

It's funny to see people who have no idea about why the META works so good complain about it.

Also, everyone who goes ""hurr durr, everyone is DPS, there is no support or CC"" is wrong. Optimal teams bring everything, DPS, support and control. The thing is, they bring support and control without sacrificing DPS.

Are you saying someone like you who has several firearms would kill someone for something minor as wearing a different color shirt then you, saw it in a movie, saw someone texting during the previews of a movie? Anything is a weapon and can be used to kill. It is not the weapon that kills, it is just the means to kill, it is the person behind the weapon that is doing the killing."

Firstly, as the article itself states, the message in this article only applies to the select few BJJ competitors who express a desire to be a BB world champ. But someone who is seriously training to be a BB world champ is probably already dedicating their entire lives towards BJJ anyway- this article is just stating the obvious.. ""it must be an obsession, you must devote your life to it""- no shit????  You think Keenan or Kit Dale or anyone else chasing gold at the worlds need to be told they won't be a champ at black belt  unless they make BJJ the #1 thing in their life? Heck, anyone who is trying to be the very best at any sport knows this.

Warfarin is rat poison. It's an anticoagulant that kills rats by thinning out their blood until they bleed out all their orifices. If your blood is like molasses then it keeps you alive. Anyone who's taking warfarin knows it is rat poison because they *must* take it or die. Knowing they can substitute rat poison in an emergency is important.

This undermines your whole argument.

Trying to limit the use of the word inherently puts you at odds with the paths you don't follow. 'Correcting' people's usage of the word is, therefore, just a thinly-veiled attempt to convince them that only your path is the true one. It's dishonest: If you're going to do that, engage in their ideas directly. Don't use language as a proxy."

If you have to constantly research online using Ctrl + F will bring up a search box and then search key topics. 

Learning other basic computer shortcuts will help you save time when researching and writing assignments, e.g. Ctrl + Shift + T to reopen a new tab. 

Buying a laptop (or net book, desktop computer) may also be useful so that way you can use it over the summer, install the programs you want and you may even be able to tax it back.

Backing up every assignment or research paper is a great idea, as when you are dealing with 4000+ word essays, you cannot afford to lose it.
 
Try searching online for your university webpage. They may offer the course document, circulated emails about the course, past exam papers and assessment reports from them.

and using online education platforms such as Codecadamy (okay maybe something alot more advanced, couldn't think of anything else).

As far as team ups that weren't successive. If they got Zyuranger and Abaranger to team up with Kyuryuger, I'd like to see them get MMPR and Dino Thunder for the American adaptation, but I'll probably be dead by the time that happens.

By the same logic, I'd like to see the Alien Rangers, Ninja Storm, and Samurai."

s-mores,dontstarve,1389875801.0,"Long day pros:

* Less squinting at the screen because it's simply brighter.
* Slightly easier to explore, you have ~20% more bright hours.
* Obviously less problems from hounds/spiders at night

Long day cons:

* You'll basically never get use out of bunnymen.
* Far less advantage to camping near a swamp or dropping spider nests in swamps.
* Harder to get fireflies/mushrooms.
* Less time to shave beefalo.

**TL;DR** Easier early game, but you shoot yourself in the foot in the long run.

Long summer pros:

* **Much** more time to explore, you'll easily explore the whole world during your first summer.
* You can do 'projects' much more easily, eg make huge pig villages, plunder the entire world of stone, set up huge arenas with monsters.
* Less overall time doing 'chores'.

Long summer cons:

* Harder to get winter items *(snowbird feathers, blue gems, tam'o'shantern, walking stick)* 

**TL;DR** *(at least after surviving your first one)* Winter only adds tedium, not difficulty. The game is tedious enough already. Still, I wish there was a middle ground between 20/15 and 50/10 split, 42% winter is too much but 17% is kinda low."

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1389875912.0,"&gt; I think that most MRA's understanding of feminist language is lacking.

I agree. Because there are different definitions from the various feminist camps, making it all too confusing. Sometimes I just don't have time to look up all the various definitions of Patriarchy (see [jurupa's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/1vbcy7/ramping_up_the_antimra_sentiment/ceqnpj0)) before commenting. So I go with the most popular definition *I see.*

It's not realistic to expect people to keep up with all the different definitions of the same concept. I have a full-time job, a house to take care of, a gf to visit, and I come here in my little spare time.

He is confirmed for the first 3 episodes in Season 4 on [his IMDB page](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915453/?ref_=nv_sr_1), which probably means that Sansa is going to be with LF going to the Eyrie by the end of episode 3 (which means PW will have happened by then). I cannot think of any other reason for him being in Season 4, than for him to shuttle Sansa to LF, even though we haven't seen him since Season 2.

That whole storyline, of him helping Sansa out and whisking her away from King's Landing, is a very romantic story and quite charming, albeit kind of creepy. He was a very endearing character, only wanting to make the poor, tormented Stark child happy.

And then he is shot full of crossbow bolts and then has his body burned.

Very tragic, yet very sweet.

You're left with nothing because you neglected to maintain your friendships. BJJ friends are like that- easy to hang out with because you share the bond of BJJ, but what if you or they quit the sport or move to another area? Will you still hang?  I doubt it, sounds like the hanging out happens subsequent to your training. 

IMO balance is necessary. Yeah I notice my friends circle gets smaller as I get older, but I have friends outside of BJJ who are worth keeping and making an effort for. Its up to you whether you have friends like that... if you do, then don't be the guy who turns his back on his mates. "

Sausage Gravy Recipe:

* 1/2lbs. Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage 
* 4 Slices of Bacon
* Cast Iron Skillet
* Butter
* 4 tbsp. all purpose flour
* 2 Glasses of Whole Milk

1. Pour two glasses of whole milk and set aside.
2. Brown the sausage on low-medium heat until fully cooked and fat completely rendered.
3. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to a bowl.
4. Add bacon to cast iron skillet, cook until crisp, transfer to paper towels.
5. Add butter until you have ~4 tablespoons of butter/sausage/bacon grease in the bottom of the skillet. (Depending on the fat content of your sausage and bacon, you may not need to add any butter).
6. Sift in 4 tablespoons of all-purpose flour, and stir like hell, but be very careful to not splatter yourself. You're making a mocha-colored roux, aka Cajun Napalm. If you splatter it on yourself, it'll scar for months.
7. When the roux is the right color, pour in half of the milk. Season liberally with salt and black pepper, stir to combine and let it come to a boil again.
8. Pour in the other half of the milk until you reach the volume you want but consistency will still be a bit thin.
9. Let simmer/reduce until you reach the thickness you desire. 
10. Adjust seasoning (don't be shy with the salt, that much milk/flour will need it, depending how much is left from your bacon and sausage drippings). Pour into the bowl with the sausage and stir to combine.
11. Server over fresh-baked biscuits that are split in half. If you want to cheat, I use Grands large buttermilk biscuits, because they're damned tasty. "

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1389877298.0,"&gt; Does the poor representation of women in politics constitute gender injustice, given that we can demonstrate that the choices of women are in large part responsible for that poor representation?

I don't have enough info. Do women just get tired of dealing with the ""old boy network""? Because I hear it's especially strong in politics, especially national US congress. That could be a social issue which I might call ""injustice"", or I might call it ""lower tolerance for BS"", which I would not call injustice. [""Theory on why women earn less, with a study""](http://freakonomics.com/2013/10/18/a-unifying-theory-of-why-women-earn-less/) says that women are just, as a group, less confrontational and less competitive. 


&gt; Does the fact that men make up a high percentage of workplace deaths constitute gender injustice, given that we can demonstrate that the choices of men are in large part responsible for that high percentage?

Sort of. This is a complex issue. Men just aren't forced to work these dangerous jobs. They work them to earn more money for their families. Some choose not to go to college for various reasons, and instead choose dangerous jobs. 

I made it through college only because of a combination of hard work on my part, college grants, and gov't backed loans. I didn't choose to be poor. But I can't realistically work hard and long enough to pay for all 4 years of college in a minimum wage job. 
Was I oppressed? I don't think so because I didn't WANT to be oppressed. Was life hard for me? Yes.  Was I unlucky? Hell yes. I started out with much less than most people. I made it through college because I persevered and sacrificed while my peers spent much of their money on used sports cars and beer. For the most part they are still in low-wage jobs. Some things are choices, some things are not. It's not a clear cut situation. **But I choose to have the attitude that I'm not an oppressed victim.** 

IMO, victimhood is what people choose so they don't have to do the work themselves to change. I suspect I will get a lot of disagreement on this issue of attitude. 

&gt; Let's consider further the case of the biological determinist/gender essentialist, who posits that men are biologically attuned to the role of masochistic fuck toy.

Do some men have a high sex drive? Certainly, but not all men. Many younger men have a low sex drive, just go browse /r/askmen. Or /r/deadbedrooms. 

&gt; Masochistic: deriving pleasure ~~or sexual gratification~~ from being abused ~~or dominated~~

And masochistic? I don't think the word masochistic applies to most men (although some are submissive in the bedroom), men do tend to take more risks, but not all men do that. They don't do it to abuse themselves or be dominated, they do it for adventure, and to get high. (Yes I was a teen once but I did research safety issues before taking risks.) 
Do men take more risks? Definitely, and studies support this. Car insurance rates are much higher for teen (inexperienced) drivers. But I don't think they can base rates on sex, because that would be illegal in the US. So, all teen rates are raised. 

But saying ""masochistic fuck toy"" is inflammatory and thus misses the point with the majority of readers who don't understand the definition of ""masochistic"". It's simply easier to say ""men, especially young men, take more risks than women, as a group"". 

Saying men are ""masochistic fuck toys"" is an injustice because it makes a generalization about the majority of men which cannot be proven with facts.

I'm guessing that Ukrainians and Latvians would be far better for a whole host of reasons than Pakistanis and North Africans... This is a serious question and I was never able to make sense of it. PS&gt; I think that Persian immigrants have a great reputation almost everywhere.

Belgium focused on Southern Europe (Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, .. laborers in exchange for coal was the deal most of the time) and just went one step further in that direction when that source dried up (Morocco and Turkey). But most of the latter group of immigrants came there after the controlled migration and the need for labor, through family reunification and so on. Now it's mostly a mixed bag of the latest war zone that manages to get in. Besides the European migration of course, but that's never been as visible.

France and the UK preferred their colonies to recruit migrants (Indians/Pakistanis and Algerians), naturally.

TheLittleGoodWolf,MensRights,1389877679.0,"&gt; I would expect some sort of validation from his family - but if there is none, the woman does not retain the right to his DNA.

The right to bodily autonomy should remain even in death. I am part of a national registry of organ donors where I state which organs I wish to donate if I die. I there are no such wishes expressed no one should have the right to decide that for me even after I die. how to handle burial and similar things are different.

&gt;I will admit that if something happened that put my husband in the same situation, the idea of having the option to bear his child would come to mind.

Why? You are effectively thinking about creating a child with a dead father. This is not a question of already carrying the child when something happens, this is premeditated and that's why I find it mean to the child. What will you tell the child when he/she asks about their father? Will you tell them that they were just a desperate attempt at keeping a part of their father alive through them?

&gt;We have come to an understanding of how each of us would like to handle such a situation (DNRs, funerals, etc) but have not written it down or put it on record.

Make sure you do put it on record. I don't know about the laws where you are but I wouldn't want decision of DNR to be in the hands of my spouse or any of those close to me. They are in an emotional position at that time and in no condition to make such a decision. To take some weight off the both of you in the case of such an event make sure it's put on record in one way or the other.

&gt;I would like anyone willing to please elaborate or explain why this would be viewed an issue from the male perspective.

It's a case of bodily autonomy being denied to a male who is unable to give his consent. It doesn't matter how much they may have tried to have children or wanted to have them. The situation is drastically changed and there is no way to get or to prove his consent. That makes it an issue of male rights plain and simple. Had it been written down that she would have the rights to his sperm in the event of an accident or whatever this would not have been an issue.

&gt;I do not see raising a child whose father has passed away as so damaging that denying them life itself is a better solution.

It's not denying the child a right to live, the child does not exist yet. This is no different than letting an ejaculation or an egg go to ""waste"" by not procreating. Had she already been pregnant it would be a different thing, but now she's wants to create a child without a father.

&gt;This would not be a choice I would make unless this his death was a garantee. 

This should not be your choice at all unless your husband has given his written consent to make it so.

&gt;My main issue here is that most comments claim that this woman is 'stealing' his DNA and is meaning to manipulate him.

Because she is effectively ""stealing"" his DNA, she is taking without consent. He cannot give consent and she cannot give it for him, again rights to bodily autonomy, she has no ""right"" to take any part of his body without his consent. I don't see how she could manipulate him seeing as he's comatose and at deaths door, his estate however is another issue.

&gt;the fact remains that nobody really knows whether or not this couple wanted children and she if she is trying to manipulate him.

And that is as I said before not the point. The point is that he did not give prior consent to a case like this and he's not able to give consent now. The assumption should so be that he is not consenting. Imagine (however morbid it may be) that she were to have sex with him in his current state. Wouldn't that be rape? He cannot give consent so it's sex without consent right? It's the same principle really. Weather married or not you have no rights to your partners body unless you can prove it with written consent. I would have had no different outlook if they had been married no.

I feel like I said the same thing over and over but it was needed to answer your questions. I hope I have made you see where, at least I, am coming from in this issue. I don't care about motives, no matter how pure or dirty, I care about rights."

talldane1,tall,1389877734.0,"&gt;Do you guys see a short guy as your equivalent?

This seems to be your main question, so I can answer it (at least from my perspective).  First, I don't actually even notice most people's height at all.  The top of an average height guy's head comes up to about my shoulder.  Try this:  put your hand just below your own shoulder and imagine the top of someone's head there (that's about average).  Then move your hand down about four inches (that's considered short).  Would you really notice the difference visually?  Height is very obvious when you're close to eye level with people.  I'm never close to eye level, so I rarely even notice at all.

Second, I think being tall so early gave me a good understanding of what height means and what it doesn't.  I was the tallest person in my small town by the time I was 13.  Taller than all of the adults.  I certainly didn't run around thinking I was superior or anything like that - I was a KID and knew it.  The (shorter-than-me) adults were the people with knowledge and authority.  I think that's why I've never associated height with worth.  Being very tall has advantages and disadvantages, just like any other height.  

I look down on people literally (because I have to) but **not** figuratively.

EDIT:  *Sorry that was long, but I want credit for not going with my first response:  ""They're good in soup.""*

&gt;Bond: * *Shifts uncomfortably, completely changes the subject* *

From The World is Not Enough.

Now I know this is a pretty big stretch. It could refer to any of the previous Bond girls who died, most probably Paris Carter from the previous film where it's pretty heavily implied Bond is actually in love with her, as opposed to the mildly attracted/obligated to protect he sees the other girls.

Trevelyan also points out that Bond's parents died in a freak rock climbing accident (or something similar, I can't quite recall) so it could also be a reference to that.

I always chose to believe, however, that he simply didn't want to talk about Tracy. It makes Bond seem very vulnerable for just a moment in the scene, and I like it. 

Also you could argue that since the film has a reference to On Her Majesty's Secret Service in its title (Bond remarks it's his family motto, which hasn't been referenced in any other film) they might throw in another very subtle one about the death of his wife.


Again, very far stretch and maybe I'm thinking too far into it but I always liked seeing that scene this way."

Ralkir,changemyview,1389878021.0,"Did I ever imply that I meant all? No absolutely not. So you are trying to tell me that in a feminist context, all patriarchy theory means to feminists is that men hold more positions of power. Is that correct? Because if I go to askfeminists right after this, I GUARANTEE you that they will say otherwise. So is this your personal belief or the view of feminism. 

Do not lie and deny that feminism continually spews out the line that ""men are privileged."" Or my personal favourite ""check your privilege"". 

Edit: Quick edit incase you say yes to my clarifying question because your link is stating exactly what I have already stated. From this [page](http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/03/11/faq-what-is-male-privilege/)

&gt;Male privilege is a set of privileges that are given to men as a class due to their **institutional power** in relation to women as a class. While every man experiences privilege differently due to his own individual position in the social hierarchy, **every man**, by virtue of being read as **male by society**, benefits from **male privilege.**

So it is clearly stated there. That you state that patriarchy theory is that men are in the most positions of power. And then feminism clearly states right after this, that ALL men are privileged because of this, even though the proportions of the population are immensely different. Nice try, I'm not using any term incorrectly. "

2. If the goal has been given, get the fuck over it. If a referee makes a decision he does not go back on it so bitching and whining won't help and more importantly even if the referee got the decision wrong and he knows it, he would rather take the punishment (referee points deducted) from the governing body of the league than commit career suicide and go back on his decision in live play.

That being said the referee should have understood and known that the player was clearly in an offside position, as soon as that ball left the players foot to go over to the player in an offside position the linesman should have raised his flag IMMEDIATELY to notify the referee that the ball is going into an offside position. Even if the player didn't recieve the ball, it was still an offside play only a tackle can counter the idea that it's offside and allow play to carry on, but it was a deflection from a ball that was played into an offside position.


End of the day, the defender fucked up, the linesman fucked up, the referee fucked up and the entire team fucked up. Quite a bit of luck from Napoli and it was clearly win win for them."

seanomenon,alcoholism,1389878234.0,"AA is usually the last resort for people who have repeatedly tried and failed to control their drinking. For us, the only control is not drinking at all. 

Some people in AA adopt a ""live and let live"" attitude, some think alcohol is evil. Some become very aware of others who are overdoing it.  Another problem I've found is that some drinkers assume a sober person is judging them. If she's actually saying judgemental things to you, then you can either dismiss it or examine it and see if there's some truth there. If you assume she'd judging you, but she isn't saying anything, then you might want to examine why you are assuming that, and think about whether its really happening or not.

If you want to maintain and salvage your friendship, I highly recommend sober activities together. See a movie, have dinner, play a sport, do whatever you like with her sober, and save your drinks for your friends who don't have drinking problems. This shouldn't be a problem for someone with control over their drinking. Your friend will certainly appreciate activities that don't involve drink."

JackPAnderson,worldnews,1389878277.0,"&gt;Also I find your comparison to being gay poor because of the difference between consensual/non consensual.

He was talking about the *desires themselves* being ingrained and unchangeable. In other words, just as no amount of therapy or drugs will turn a gay person straight, no amount of therapy or drugs will turn a person sexually attracted to children into being attracted to adults. 

Perhaps that will change in the future, but right now, there is no way to ""fix"" a pedophile. They are born that way, and it's not their fault. I think that we ought to try to do better by the pedophiles who haven't acted on their desires and just want help controlling those desires. As it stands, if you go to a psychiatrist and admit to being sexually attracted to kids then you get reported to the authorities and put into the system. That prevents people from seeking help. So, instead, they are out in society with no support and eventually they wind up offending. 

Our current witch hunt approach to pedophilia does a disservice to the pedophiles and the children they victimize. "
Scarcer,microgrowery,1389878280.0,"Good job! Looks like you have maybe 2 weeks left.

I'd give it maybe two more nutrient cycles, and give it 7-11 days with out (only water) before harvest.

Sure the buds look good now, but I can tell you that they are still swelling and look a little on the green side. The best bud will be if you wait till the later half of the harvest window; comparatively they are still 10-14 days away from the beginning of that window (at the very least). The very earliest to stop feeding nutrients is when over 1/2 of the stigmas have dried and turned orange, all of yours are still white and wet.

You don't really need to ""flush"", it's a myth. Transition with one slightly excessive watering, then water as normal. The purpose is to let the plant finish naturally without a chemical excess, not to starve it.

The earliest to harvest would be when 75-80% of the stigmas have turned color (unless you have a magnifying glass to judge the trichomes). Optimally would be to wait until 95-100% of the stigmas have changed color. You can age the flowers a little further if you want an overly stoney smoke.

The hardest part is learning to cure properly. 

Probably the easiest way would be to defoliate all of the large leaf off, remove them (save or throw them away). Cut the plants down by the stalk and hang them upside down by halves or quarters from the top of your tent or a closet. Keep a fan blowing on them; you don't want any stagnant air around the plants or buds.

It may take between 3-5 (or more) days for them to dry enough depending on the size.

Once they feel dry enough to smoke ( they aren't ) to the touch, you can start cutting buds and manicure them to your desire. The more leaf you remove, the more flavor and floral aroma that will be released from the flower. At this point you can jar them.

For the first 3-7 days, you need to check the jars twice a day, empty them out into a cardboard box for an hour or more to let them dry. Curing buds sweat a lot of moisture. You want the buds dry (but not brittle crisp) to the touch each time you put them into the jars.

Each day as you do this you'll get a feel for how fast the buds are sweating and how much moisture is left, meaning you can wait longer and longer. Once you are satisfied, you can wait several days before doing one last dry (for good measure) before storing the bud for long periods.

**Curing jars should be quart size with wide mouths.** From experience I can tell you that larger or smaller jars do NOT work well and cause problems. You need the wide mouth to make the entire process easier.

At this point when you are ready to store the bud, take out as much as you'll need to last you for two weeks at a time and store that amount in ""desk jars"", ""nug jars"" or a suitable storage for easy access.

Then store the rest of the bud away in a dark place.

This is done, because after the primary curing process is complete, you want as little oxygen or fresh air to touch the buds as possible. Fresh air drys the bud to a crisp, defeating half the purpose of a good cure; oxygen will degrade and age the bud, making it brown and spicy over time. Keep this in mind, and be conservative about how often you open up the jars.

**The number one enemy for growers is mold during the harvest.**

Good luck! :D"

That means doing fun stuff together rather than sitting in a room for 6 hours laughing at a video of a dog.

4. Don't make generalizations about a group. Say ""some MRAs"" or ""some feminists"" and you'll be ok. The comment might get reported but I tend to reinstate it and let the votes decide. If you say ""MRAs are just FOS"", it's assumed you mean ""all MRAs"" and you will get an offense. 
4. Qualify statements with ""In my opinion"" or ""In my experience"" and that will be ok. Still, try not to be too offensive. This subreddit is for discussion, not venting. 
4. Address the writer's argument, not the writer personally. Do not make personal attacks. 
4. Realize you don't know everything, and start off by asking questions. You might want to start your post by defining how YOU define terms also, as the same words can have several definitions.
4. It helps if you start off by saying what you agree with before you continue with what you disagree with. Compliments will go far by indicating you are mature person capable of rational discourse. 
5. Play nice.

The reason they're finding new things is because the book, upon expansion via blood or ink, says they're there and they **manifest**? I thought they were just discovering where to look!

myrrlyn,teslore,1389878516.0,"1. You are entirely correct, which you'd have known if you read [Aurbis: The Musical](http://myrrlyn.com/apocrypha/aurbis-music.html) :)

2. Been covered as to why it's not Camoran, but as to who it actually is, I'm of the opinion that it's the first King of Alinor, and by King I mean the mythic title as well as the political one. When the Daedra destroyed CLL physically, they also destroyed his tomb/monument (CLL was chock full of them, remember) and with his body and remembrance gone, the Tower was destroyed as well as the tower.

3. Do we know Falinesti is Green-Sap? Everybody assumes that but now that I think about it, I can't think of sources. If it is Falinesti, I see zero reason that the Stone isn't the **city in Falinesti's branches**. I mean, think about it. ""Fruit"" refers to the product of labor and effort, not just plant-genitals. Fruit as plant-genitals hangs in branches. What else profits from Falinesti's labor and hangs in its branches? AN ENORMOUS CITY. So I'm with you on that one. ^(which begs the question what happened to Falinesti the city... awkies)

4. I believe it.

5. OPGreenback would tell you that they worship Mannimarco/Revenant now, and I'd sit quietly and not comment because I don't know Sload **at all**.

6. PC's are whack, man. I don't see how immortality or Miraak-mantling can be done, the former because nobody on Mundus has it and the latter because the dude ain't Mythic AFAIK. Personally I like to think he jumps on a Dragon and follows the Nerevarine to Akavir, which is a euphemism for dying penniless and unknown, or actually going to Akavir, which is basically the same thing.

7. Well the Tsaesci were men, so why the hell not.

8. Aldmeris itself is a social state. Though Thras could be the thing people unknowingly mean when they talk about the physical ""Aldmeris"" that never was, though I think it's more probably Pyandonea. Pyandonaea. Um, halp. Anyway, yeah, the Ruin of Aldmeris was a [social split](http://myrrlyn.com/apocrypha/bedtime-story.html). The Ruin of A(l)tmora was a physical freeze. (See how those are nicely opposite, OPG? The mythic dichotomous mirror of man and mer isn't broken at all by this.)

For example, without Net Neutrality, it would be possible for an ISP to charge you extra for using Google instead of Bing or their own - most likely crappy and add-infested - search engine. Or instead, they could limit the bandwidth for Google, but not for the other search engines.

Another example, seeing as most ISPs are also cable companies, it would become possible for them to effectively cripple video services like YouTube and NetFlix instead of having to compete with them."

The first sentence is a run-on that made my eye twitch.

Velorium_Camper,whatsbotheringyou,1389879164.0,"Look at things like this: You arrived late several times to his class. Arriving to class late is typically disruptive. That's part of the reason he yelled at you. He had no clue about your depression and you didn't tell him you had it. You explained to him that you had a sleep problem. Most teachers/professors don't care about if you're not sleeping great. They do however care if you arrive late. He probably held you to a higher standard because he had your siblings before you and because you hung out with his son.

As to why you feel bad for being yelled at: you've compared yourself to your siblings. They had positive experiences with this class but you have not so maybe you feel like you've failed them/your family. You shouldn't feel like this though. Depression is hard but you have to remember that a teacher's job is to teach. With you arriving late, it prevents that. Also he called you out in front of everyone. No one likes to be embarrassed in front of others.

How do you stop the nightmares and get better? I think you should see a counselor and talk about this. If that's not feasible, my advice to you is this: stop beating yourself up. You made mistakes, who on this planet hasn't? Work on being better at time management if you haven't already. Stop comparing your progress to your siblings. And stop beating yourself up for being late. It happens to us all.

In theory I agree with this sentiment but in practice we do indeed have an extremist fringe.  The thing is, if an extremist fringe gets 1% of the votes then who's to say they shouldn't have 1% of the seats?  Isn't that the point?  
Apparently people think this is a problem because people don't want a radical group in a position to decide issues on which everyone else is split.  It seems to me that if people are split nearly 50:50 on an issue then there needs to be a lot more discussion of that issue before anything gets decided either way, regardless.

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1389879395.0,"&gt; Some MRAs will potentially claim that this is about female superiority, that if women get 100% of the opportunities men will get 0%.

Women being allowed to at least apply for a job is not the same as excluding men from applying. If a woman is more qualified, she should get the job. Women are preferred in customer service jobs because they are more pleasant, and I'm guessing, they are more likely to stay cool under pressure from irate customers. 95% of voices in voice mail systems I've heard are of women. There's a reason for that, people just like the systems better that way. It does not mean men's voices are unpleasant, it just means women's voices are more pleasant.

Takuya-san,LearnJapanese,1389879589.0,"Remembering the Kanji by James Heisig, a method that associates a single keyword with each kanji/primative and uses those keywords combined to form stories for new kanji - there's no readings (pronunciation) learned until later. If you don't know the kana yet, Heisig also has Remembering the Hiragana and Remembering the Katakana.

The main advantage is that you learn how to write all of the common kanji up front and in a short time, allowing you to interact with all Japanese media (be it websites, manga, Japanese subtitles, etc.) within a few months - you learn the kanji readings (pronunciation) as you go, and you don't have to learn uncommon kanji readings that you will rarely need anyway.

I recommend reading [comment thread I participated in recently](http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1ufpcn/similar_kanji_like_%E5%9C%9F_vs_%E5%A3%AB/ceiatg4) for an overview and how to get started. "

worminthewoodwork,Antiques,1389879631.0,"The thing with Chairs and furniture of a great age is that they will not have any markings on them unless made by a very high end manufacturer or retailed by a high end store. So 95% of the time you have to base your judgement on the quality and characteristics of the piece. Does the patina look right, is the carving style right for the age, does the chair shape fit with the period (fashion had a great influence on chair styles, as well as social constructs). To me, the chair is rather crudely carved, but a lot of people tried to cheaply emulate master carvers. The barley twist fits in with the early 19th century, and the patina looks right - when someone sits in a chair their hands will rub where the Lions heads are, and you may even get rubbing on the crosser at the front if they rest their feet there often. So judging from pictures on the internet, it seems right."

myrrlyn,teslore,1389880045.0,"(This answer is for everyone reading, not just you)

/r/teslore/about/sidebar (mobile users don't see the sidebar, so I hope this link works in API clients) contains the following:

1. /r/teslore/w/newscholarsguide is an excellent accelerant post containing a few resources and a general overview. Read the linked Imperial Library post. **And then read the Imperial Library. DO IT.** Link because they have horrible luck with search engines: http://imperial-library.info/ **Seriously, read this place**. Read the books. Read the developer posts. Read the art galleries. Read the librarian articles. Maybe read the forums (yes they have forums, but I don't know of anyone who actually uses them). When you provide links to written sources (in or out of game), link to TIL or UESP rather than (heaven forbid) the elderscrolls wikia. I cannot stress this enough; **TIL IS YOUR BEST FRIEND FOR HARD SOURCES.** Your absolute best friend. It is the /r/teslore of facts, by which I mean, the most stunningly incredible place out of all the contenders.

2. /r/teslore/w/faq contains questions that are a) frequently asked and b) asked despite the faq existing. Now don't take this to mean you can never ask about topics on the FAQ; that's not the point at all. Just ask better questions than the ones covered. ""What happened to the Dwemer"" is a question deader than the Dwemer. ""WHY did that happen"" is a good one. And ""but I think the Dwemer did this for this reason"" just gets people hurt.

3. /r/teslore/1dbptb/ contains a link to a Google Doc called the Pocket Guide to the Lore. It's pretty good. I still haven't read it, but it was made after my own pressing need for such a document was filled.

4. http://uesp.net/ contains the most encyclopedic background of the Aurbis I've yet seen. It's not spectacular, lore-wise, but it contains pretty much every speck of information, even if only to tell you that a thing exists and nothing more. Read the game summaries, the race summaries, the timelines, and the gods list. (Okay, so it's not in the sidebar. Keep this link anyway.)

5. /r/teslore/w/compilation is pretty hit-or-miss for new folks. You **definitely** want Vaelkri's *Bloody Blackreach*. I also highly recommend perusing the named folk in /r/teslore/w/compilationauthor, because it takes three posts in the Apocrypha to get a name listing and by then it generally means that said poster Knows Their Stuff. It's not important to understand everything right away; you sure as hell won't for RottenDeadite's stuff unless you're some kind of overly-informed guru like he is ^(compliment, I promise). ""Then why did you tell me to read it, myrrlyn?"" Because that way you'll get a relatively broad sample of the deeper lore and you can pick what topics actually interest or disinterest you (if you hate Orcs, give half my stuff a pass, for instance, and if Khajiit are your thing, you're going to love Mr_Flippers), learn more about them, and come back to the formerly-opaque fan posts armed with more information and a mind used to the topic.

You have some questions, like, ""who is Akatosh"", or ""what are the Aedra"", and so on, and you're probably thinking ""these are some pretty basic questions that have definite answers that I'll need to know before going deeper.""

Let me just rip that particular Band-Aid off right now.

There are approximately zero answers in TES lore that are simple, clean, accurate, and comprehensive.

This is not your standard fantasy universe. This is not your standardly-built world. This is not even **close** to having your standard definition of canon. Coming at TES expecting a standard structure will leave you lost and confused.

TES is layered, insane, self-contradictory, horrifying, amazing, blatantly sexual, with Byzantine levels of political intrigue, racism that is factually permissible, schismatic, confusing, vast, deep, and **weird**.

Welcome to the Dream."

The problem, from the plutocrat's point of view is that the internet permits unstructured communication between the little people. This can reasonably be extrapolated to the eventual and inevitable fomentation of revolution.  Ergo, it must be stifled/controlled.

The attempts to resolve the CP problem merely give them the opportunity to indirectly address their other issues while not appearing overtly to be attempting to do so.  They end up merely derided as fools, rather than lynched as traitors.

They are not stupid people.  They could easily hire/appoint knowledgeable, talented people to attempt to directly address the singular problem of CP without destroying the basic utility of the medium for other purposes if they chose. If only those other purposes were not so problematic for the establishment, they might even do so.

When in doubt, follow the money."

In the US all employment can be terminated at will.  Meaning companies can hire seasonal workers.  Adults don't like seasonal work, adults need a stable paycheck.  Young people don't care as much about stability, they want high pay.  So it works out well for both parties."

joshuran,truezelda,1389880611.0,"* Wii plays the most Zelda games (10 total vs 8 on Wii U).

* 3DS is not compatible with GBA games, but it is compatible with DS games. It has access to the GB games (LA, OoS, OoA) via virtual console, but Minish Cap is apparently not for sale yet. Wii and Wii U get N64 via virtual console. Only Wii plays GCN games.

* Best side-quest game was probably Wind Waker, and that's on any of the 3 major console options (GCN, Wii, Wii U (w/ HD version). 

* Twilight Princess is likely the most similar to Oot. This is available on GCN and Wii (and therefore playable also on WiiU)

* DS Lite goes for about $40 used, GCN $20, Wii $50, and Wii U you'd want new I expect, which is $300. 3DS is $110. Zelda games are a bit pricy, even used. All prices below assume used unless new is cheaper.
 * **DS Lite**: plays GBA games (not GB), so that gives you access to Minish Cap (~$20), LttP port (~$25) (also on virtual consoles), Phantom Hourglass (~$20), and Spirit Tracks (~$30) (neither of which are very much like OoT). **Total: $135, 4 games**, or $110 minus LttP
 * **Gamecube**: plays Twilight Princess (~$45) (the GCN version is more rare), Wind Waker (~$40), and Master Quest (~$35) (oot dungeon re-map) **Total: $140**, 3 games
 * **Wii**: With Virtual console, gets you access to LoZ, AoL, LttP, OoT, and MM for cheap. plays Twilight Princess (~$20), Wind Waker (~$40), Master Quest (~$35), Skyward Sword (~$40). **Total: $185, 4 games** + Virtual Console
 * **Wii U**: Same Virtual console access (I think that library is the same now? It will be soon, if not). plays Twilight Princess (~$20), Wind Waker HD (~$50, but it's bundled, too), Skyward Sword (~$40). **Total, assuming WW bundle: $360, for 3 games** plus virtual console
 * **3DS**: GB games via virtual console: Link's Awakening, Oracle of Ages and Seasons, Minish Cap to be released, all cost &lt;$10). Plays Spirit Tracks (~$30), Phantom Hourglass (~$20), OoT 3DS (~$35), A Link Between Worlds (~$30). **Total: $225, for 4 games** plus virtual console.

*prices sourced from Amazon and don't include shipping or tax

Considering all of the above, the Wii is definitely your best bang for buck. Most games more similar to OoT for the least amount of money. Games for Wii are still relatively cheap and not rare, so you can pick up games like Brawl, Okami (very highly recommend this to Zelda fans), Monster Hunter, Paper Mario, Xenoblade, Last Story, Mario games, all that biz. Plus, GCN backwards compatibility gives you access to my personal all-time favorite game console. GCN games will require a GCN controller and memory card, so that could be another $40 on top: $30 gets you a brand new amazing best controller of all time white GCN controller, accept no 3rd party options.

I would also steer you away from portable games unless you can say you really liked LttP. If you haven't played LttP, you really should. Link's Awakening and Minish Cap are fantastic follow-ups to that style of game, then A Link Between Worlds is just amazing. I am not a huge fan of Spirit Tracks or Phantom Hourglass, and their control schemes are a bit unique.

As mentioned in another comment, Wii U is definitely your most future proof option. Although you don't get access to Master Quest, you do get the other great options. I should mention Master Quest is on OoT3DS also, but I really am not a fan of that version because it mirrors the entire game world. The idea behind that is ""extra challenge,"" but having played so much OoT, it just makes me feel nauseous.

**tldr:** Get a Wii, play Twilight Princess, then Wind Waker, then Skyward Sword. Later, find yourself a Master Quest disc and play the hell out of OoT all over again.

edit: emboldening

edit 2: added answers to first two bullets, elaborated on Wii costs

edit 3: I keep thinking of new things! Oh god I forgot about Four Swords Adventure (GCN + Wii only)

EDIT 4!!: As mentioned below, I did forget the Collector's Edition Gamecube disc, which adds 4 more playable games to the Gamecube: LoZ, AoL, OoT, and MM (though IIRC, MM had a bug or two). Lowest on Amazon is $45, though /u/rabiiiii says ebay has it for ~$40. For that matter, ebay is probably a good place to check for all of the above.

Also from the other comments, it's clear you need to make sure the Wii you get has Gamecube compatibility."

It's what athletes refer to ""being in the zone"", where everything just slows down and it feels like everything is just clicking.

What I think is happening with you is that your mind keeps goin back to your practice, and you're trying to duplicate an unduplicatable experience - taking you out of the moment while you 'force' things. Your mind should be clear and you should be ready to react without thinking.

You could also try to align yourself with the idea that *every* match you play is ""practice"", regardless of what's at stake.

Just so you know all guys are not close-minded poopie heads, who sometimes blurt things out because of their own insecurities, I'm absolutely fine with all of that. And more power to ya. The more I get to know you, the more I find you interesting. 

&gt; the construction of femininity is similar to the expectations placed upon children - weak, in need of protection, emotional, intellectually inferior. It doesn't make any sense to compare us to children **because [in many cultures] women are already expected to act like children**, so when we perform other than these characteristics, we are not compared unfavorably to men, but to other women - undesirable women.

Wow, I never thought of why this was so. Home run again, badonkaduck. My words in [brackets.] I always wondered why some men insisted on paying for ALL dates. Did the men have some insecurity? Did they need to control things? Did they perceive this was expected of them? This is why I never assume a woman wants me to pay for a date, I simply ask. Communication = win/win. 

&gt; because women are expected to act like children.

I find this is how some girls are raised, and IME I've seen it in middle class families, and the issue creates some women who don't know how to work hard, and thus are ignorant of the work required to make a relationship work. Thus I find the average American middle-class woman unsuitable for long term relationships. 
And when I actually get to know the family, who sends the most messages to the girl to make her submissive? IME sometimes it's been the mom. 
This needs to change. I also realize the father may have had a hand in this, telling the mom ""the daughter needs to act like X.""

If I only had a daughter I'd teach her ""girly"" and ""boyly"" things, so she can choose for herself which things she likes best.

I was really hoping to choice band scizor and I've give hi U-Turn Bullet Punch Pursuit and I want one other move but I'm not sure what to go with. Ideas?"
