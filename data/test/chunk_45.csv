My best birthday ever was when I turned seventeen. I was visiting a friend halfway round the world and staying at his parents' house. In the morning I opened the gifts my parents had packed me, alone in my room. Everyone else had left the house for work/school, so I was alone. Then about an hour later my friend came to pick me up. He asked me what I wanted to do, and I asked whether it was okay if we just went back to his flat and did a TV show marathon. 

We just sat and cuddled for hours, watching Supernatural and occasionally dozing off. It was the best birthday ever because there were no expectations at all. I couldn't call my family because of the time difference, and everything was low-key. It was comforting."

TIGit,Automate,1390005697.0,"In my spare time I've tinkered with something similar, a small Mobius camera mounted inside a hard hat. I had hoped it would record worker actions so that I could better adjust process/procedure steps (reducing hand movements, steps, closeness to hazards, etc). Especially in hand-sawing where a worked uses specialized tools to help push materials through the blades of 12ft band saws, fingers and hands are often lost since this is working 12 hour days with fingers inches away from the blade all day. There are already procedures, equipment, mechanical guards, and wearable protection but injuries still happen. 

Problems I found with the camera:

- Heat. The camera give off heat that gets trapped by the hard hat on the worker's head, heat exposure is never a good thing with workers. Statistics already show when worker's brains are hotter they are more likely distracted and slower and more accidents occur. Plus workers would likely sabotoge the equipment to keep themselves cool and comfortable

- mounting system. Hard hats are curved, the camera I chose isn't. I used an epoxy clay and a case for a mock up to hold the camera in place, it was awkward and took up too much room where the worker's head should be. 

- Hard hat shell. Holes, cracks, dings, etc damage the structural integrity of the hard hat. My mock up wouldn't have passed ANSI or OSHA standards because of the hole drilled for the camera lens. Modifying the hat can ruin it's safety purpose. The camera mounted inside poses a risk to being forced into a worker's skull with a major impact. A more advanced protected external mount would be needed. But such a mount would need to keep the camera system safe from daily abuse, crushing, scrapes, drops, etc.

- Battery life, less than four hours of recording. Not so good.

- Quality. The camera I used is great for outdoors, 1080, but in limited light (I was testing it in a factory) it was terrible.


.

I've also played with Google Glas on the work site, it's okay but annoying (safety glasses, hard hat, hearing protection don't easily mesh with Glas). And for $1800 it isn't something I'd strap on every worker (as you said it's way too delicate)."

azuretek,occupywallstreet,1390005791.0,"&gt; A company has a certain profit margin it has to meet to be successful and stay open. 

If your profit margins are so heavily dictated by employee wages maybe you should consider that your business might be unsound? If other companies are able to offer widget X for $100 but it costs you $150 to produce maybe you're doing something wrong.

&gt; If my employees unionized and demanded higher pay the person who would pay them isn't me, it's you, the consumer.

That's correct, if you're building widget X as efficiently as possible you and your competitors should be able to sell your product at a profit. Anyone trying to undercut you will have the same costs associated with the product and fail (unless they produce a better product). To make a profit you just need to make a more desirable product than your competitors who either a) aren't as efficient at producing said product and are priced higher or b) make an inferior product.

&gt; Businesses don't pay the taxes, the customer does.

You shouldn't need to worry at all about increased wages or taxes, all your competitors also have to deal with this problem and the prices will reflect that. Outsourcing to reduce cost is perfectly in your right though, feel free to take your production somewhere else to compete with other businesses that do the same.

So what exactly is the problem now? If every company has the same cost associated with production (wages, taxes, etc.) why do you care so much? Maybe you're just entitled, why should anyone care if your business is successful and stays open? If it's such a problem for you to deal with maybe you should close up shop and leave it to those that can do things cheaper and better."

Keep an eye on Craigslist or other places for the following things:

* 6.0L Vortech High Output V8
* 4L65E transmission
* 3.73 differential
* SS badges
* 20"" 5-spoke wheels
* Any spare Chevy Silverado parts; could be advertised as ""high performance"" since it came off their SS truck (such as ""Chevy Silverado high performance suspension!"").

I picked those four because they're easy to pull out/off of that truck and sell, especially to people looking to do muscle car builds.  You should notify local performance shops (HESCO, Speed South, etc.) about the truck.  If you have a VIN, you can probably get serial numbers from GM.  Give these serial numbers to the shops and have them report the parts if they come in.

Hope I can be of assistance.

On a side note, that dealership has some pretty boss cars."

RampagingKoala,AskReddit,1390006250.0,"I'm really late to this party, but to anyone who is moving anywhere: DO NOT USE UHAUL.  I have two stories, both on either end of the same move.

So I moved from Chicago to Seattle, and I wanted to pack up all my stuff, and put it in storage so that I could drive out there with the stuff I actually cared about (my computer, instruments, TV) so that they wouldn't get damaged (which ended up being a really good idea).  So I heard about Uhaul's Uboxes, which are basically Pods: they would drop off the box for you, you'd put your stuff in it, and then they'd pick it up and take it where it needs to go and you could pick it up at your leisure (when I got a place in Seattle).  Sounds great!  So I made the reservation online for them to drop off the box the Thursday before I had to leave, and they'd pick it up the day I was supposed to leave (Monday) and then we'd drive out to Seattle, seeing all the sights.

Nope.  I called to confirm my reservation, and they told me that contrary to what their site says, they don't deliver Uboxes.  You have to pick them up.  But for people like me who don't have a car, that means I had to rent a truck.  So I got charged $150 because they wouldn't deliver the box.  Then I asked, well can they at least pick up the box?  To which they said no.  I asked why, as the site said they picked up boxes.  The person on the phone said ""usually we do, but we're just not doing it this week"".  So I got charged an extra fee per day because I had to hold the truck for an extra day.  They also told me (this information was also not on their site) that there are only specific days which they will accept the uboxes, that day being Saturday.  So instead of getting to take my time with the move, I had 12 hours to move all of my stuff into a Ubox.  I then got on the phone with Uhaul telling them that since they completely ignored my order, I should at least get some discount on my order.  Every single person I talked to 'agreed' with me, and they passed me around to every single area of customer service before hanging up on me mid-connection.

Then I get to Seattle, and find an apartment.  I call the Uhaul where my stuff was supposed to be delivered 2 days before I was going to move in so that I could make an arrangement to pick up my stuff.  The person on the phone said, ""sure, no problem.  noon is a great time"".  Yay.  I'm going to have a peaceful move in.  

Nope.  The day I was supposed to move in, my roommate's father suggested I call ahead ""just to be sure"" that they had my stuff.  Sure enough, the lady on the phone said they had no record of my stuff ever getting there, or me making a reservation to come get it, or me making a reservation for a truck to drive the stuff to my apartment.  So my roommate drives me to the Uhaul to sort it out.  This was a really big Uhaul, but there were only 3 employees there, two of which started that week.  The person who helped me (my favorite person ever) was this sassy older woman who told me that the people back in headquarters are ""retarded"" for leaving her by herself and for screwing me over.  She led me to an array of Uboxes saying ""it's in here somewhere, but I can't find it"".  So I had to search through the Uboxes to find my own stuff.  Then I had to help her load it on to the truck and tie it down.  I spent SIX HOURS at that Uhaul because that company doesn't give two shits about its customers (or its employees, apparently).  The woman called me afterwards telling me that there was absolutely no reason for me to pay, so she voided any charges from that excursion, and if the upper management wanted to yell at her, they could go to hell.  I love that woman, but Uhaul is a terrible, horrible, miserable excuse of a company that you should NEVER use if you want to move anything."

iPads and iPhones and their apps have existed for well over five years, and haven't yet made a single dent in Nintendos handheld efforts (along with significant competition from Sony in that same period). There is nothing that suggests that touchscreen games and apps are doing much to compete for Nintendos handheld market yet.

I do believe there is a responsibility involved before bringing a child into the world, such as financial stability, for example. However, I feel that things such as possible genetic defects are different, because there is a chance that the child will not have any defects. I won't argue that the chances aren't higher than a non-incestuous couple, but the chance still exists for those as well. There's also things that could increase those chances in non-incestuous couples, such as family history. My point is that even though there would be a higher chance of genetic defects for incestuous couples, it's not a sure thing, and as long as the parents have every intention to have a healthy child that they can provide for, they should be allowed to have that child.

Also, the examples you gave earlier, pure-bred animals and pharaohs, I believe were a result of multiple generations of in-breeding. I think that incestuous couples would not be as common, and thus the results of genetic defects would be diminished."

I was around 210lbs when I started running (@5'6""), got down to 140lbs, back up to around 155lbs now due to some muscle gain from lifting and some fat gain because I've had back problems for a year and a half which have restricted my running distances somewhat. I started with Couch to 5k, then followed on with Hal Higdon novice 10km, then HH novice half-marathon, and ran a full marathon around 16 months after I started running (not necessarily advised).

If one of my friends had these issues, I'd be more than happy to cook for them and teach them whatever I could.

I'd also like to help you with this in any way I could."

SirIngenious,nfl,1390006550.0,"Don't forget plagued with key injuries and having Samson Satele and Mike McGlynn at the interior. 

No way Hamilton (or any other OCs) would've foreseen 17 players on IR and then would've had a smooth sailing all throughout the season. So, I honestly liked Hamilton this year and I think he'll be good for us next season. He made the proper adjustments and as a result, the Colts finished 11-5 and won a playoff game at home vs KC, and is 22-10 overall, removed from a 2-14 season in 2011. That's progress!  

But yeah, since 11-5 with a playoff win at home isn't good enough, I say let's fire Hamilton, let's fire Pagano, let's fire Grigson, let's trade Luck to the Texans for a 1st rounder, and clean house! "

My reasoning: Other companies may take affirmitive actions against their customers (Goldman Sachs comes to mind) but nobody beats AT&amp;T when it comes to simply not giving a flying fuck if you live or die.

Additional justification why AT&amp;T deserves the nod: What other company has managed to fuck over every part of the free market, from investors, to employees, to suppliers, to customers? None! Sure, you can always find a company that might try to one-up AT&amp;T in a single category, but no single company on earth has managed to become so completely indifferent to the existence of anyone else but AT&amp;T.

steve496,49ers,1390006827.0,"Dennard: I admit I haven't looked at CBs in too much detail, but it is fair to say that he's the consensus highest-ranked CB in the class; looks to me that at the moment most people are projecting him as an early-teens type of guy.  I'm not sure its worth giving up enough to try to beat people to him in that range - if he goes at #12, I think we just miss out on him and try for our 2nd choice.  But if he slides to the mid-teens, I could see giving up our 1st + KC 2nd, which would let us slide up to around #16, in order to grab him.

Marqise Lee... I mean, you have to like the potential he's shown, but I have two hesitations.  First, this is an *extremely* deep WR class; I count 10 WRs with grades that could see them go in the first 50 picks (Watkins, Evans, Lee, Matthews, Benjamin, Beckham, Robinson, Cooks, Adams, and Landry).  Is Lee better than the later guys on that list?  Yeah, probably.  But is he enough better to justify trading up for?  That's less clear to me.  In a deep class like this, our early-round picks are pretty valuable.  Think about this: in last year's draft (which was nowhere near as deep), we traded up to get Eric Reid - and there's no doubt that he's been great for us.  But if we hadn't, and still had the #74 pick, we could have drafted Keenan Allen.  And would we have been better off with (say) Matt Elam and Keenan Allen instead of Eric Reid and Marlon Moore?  Hard to say, but you can at least make the argument.  And its possible that we could have still gotten Reid at #31, so...

Second, Lee is a speed receiver, in the same vein as Crabtree and Patton.  There's value in that, but I think if Boldin has taught us anything, its that there's value in having a big physical mugger of a receiver, who can create mismatches with size to complement our ability to create mismatches with speed.  Given which, all things being equal, I'd rather get someone like Evans or Benjamin if possible.

So, as usual, it comes down to cost.  If he slides to a point where we can get good value (which, given his average ranking around 20th overall, probably means early 20s), and we can get there for, say, our 1st, 3rd, and one of our many 7ths... sure, lets go for it.  But I'm not sure I'd break the bank for him."

Obviously Walmart doesn't want people standing around doing nothing so they schedule the bare minimum amount of cashiers they think they will need. The way home office expects it to work is the CSM calls for backup and everybody comes up front and gets the customers through the line quickly. What actually happens at most Walmart stores is everyone ignores it, because they have a lot to do and their shitty management will coach them for not getting their job done even though that time was spent cashiering, or management won't even allow them to get trained on the register. I've worked at 3 Walmart stores under 5 different store managers and some are a lot better than others.

I'd advise to first try to eat things that have fruit/veggies in them, rather than just biting into them raw, things like casseroles, chicken salad, etc., then moving on to cooking/serving fruit and vegetables with other things, such as apples and cheese, or brussels sprouts with bacon and apples.

There should be plenty of user created manuals around the web that show you how to do this (at least on German sites). You basically only need to remove a plastic cover, 4 screws, 2 plugs, plug them into the 510, put the 4 screws and the cover back on - done.

If the car, however, is not yet equipped with a RNS 315 or any other sat nav I doubt installing one is possible for a non-mechanic as the car needs to be equipped with an antenna that goes through the roof. I have no idea if American GTIs normally always come with a sat nav, in Germany they don't."

When he notices overt attempts to look away he brings it up. ""It's no picnic looking at you either but I'm willing to do it for the sake of politeness."" or, ""My eye's are up here, buddy"" (when they would look past him or at his shoes).

Even if that guy didn't like him for calling attention to his bad behavior, other people always seemed to take his side after these exchanges and he was quite popular!

a stable guy who has got his act together and is a decent professional and responsible will be in high demand.

but kudos to you for accepting someone who already has kids, that's very decent and accommodating of you.

Fapstronaut_TK_421,acne,1390007765.0,"Well, since I've been doing this whole thing since 2 weeks, I had to go through the options.

First I bought ginger root, I ate 1"" slices for about a week every day twice. But it tastes so awful, I almost threw it all up sometimes.

Then I bought ground ginger (in plain powder form), it tastes bad this way too, but I mix it with a little water, and hold my breath and drink it. It has some aftertaste, but better than nothing. I also do this with turmeric.

Then the other day I actually bought turmeric capsules, but it's freaking expensive compared to the plain turmeric powder, which is cheap as f*ck.

So I'm either going to buy some empty gelatine capsules and fill them with turmeric at home, or I'm going to stick with the ""mix with water"" option.

On a side note: in the past couple of days, its power seems to disappear, got some new pimples actually, but I also switched to turmeric only (I figured these are almost the same). So next experiment is to see if switching to ginger only helps again. I know for fact, that ginger has a higher inflammatory rank.

Oh, and yeah, the skin on my face is almost dry. It used to be so oily I could cook french fries in it."

Nausved,biology,1390007876.0,"Unfortunately, no single species concept is perfectly workable for all scenarios. As /u/ragingclit mentioned, some species (like asexual species) complicate matters greatly. Fossils are another example; we can rarely observe their breeding habits, ecological niches, or DNA, so we usually differentiate them via the morphological species concept‚Äîbut, of course, this is also imperfect because sometimes there is a lot of morphological variation within a single species, and sometimes two species are nearly identical anatomically.

In truth, taxonomy is an imperfect abstraction; we use it because it is convenient, not because it is strictly accurate. Speciation is not nearly so tidy and black-and-white as our categorizations imply. [The Beak of the Finch](http://www.amazon.com/The-Beak-Finch-Story-Evolution/dp/067973337X) provides a great illustration of this."

This whole taxonomy of ""good person"" and ""bad person"" needs to die. Some people can be overall scumbags yet do good things and vice versa. I may lead a life of good deeds all my life then one day decide to punch my best friend in the face with no provocation; what I just did was bad but am I still a good person? Am I now a bad person? Am I a good person who did a bad thing?

What about the average person who tries to do right by everyone yet everyone once in a while lies to their spouse because they wanted to chill on a Wednesday night and watch the free UFC card, or cheats on their taxes because otherwise they can't afford the awesome daycare for their kids. On the other hand, what about a scumbag neighbourhood drug dealer/thug who sees a young kid trying to enter his social circle and he refuses them; trying to keep that person on the straight and narrow because they determined that this kid isn't built for that lifestyle?

I suppose it probably won't help, but try to tell yourself that her behavior is her choice and her problem. And it's still going to affect you but it wasn't your fault, it was her poor choices and emotional immaturity that lead to the end of the relationship not yours."

Shirts are also typically an unstructured garment, and it's a bit weird to me when people try and give them structure by making them super fitted. It can happen, but in general if you're going for just ""Average guy wearing nice clothes"" then I don't think you want your OCBD's to be that tight.

In my experience, shirts that are that tight usually only mess up the person's silhouette anyways. They tend to accentuate the hips unnecessarily (which you can see here, even.)"

It just takes time, if you spend time on trying to play along to songs by ear you will discover what notes fit and what doesn't. It is a hard thing to explain.. there are many different skills and a diverse knowledge involved in playing in such a way. 

The ""double-stop"" techniques you mentioned also requires a certain level of knowledge of how harmony works as well. My best advice is just carry on with your learning process, and pro-actively try to play along to things, for example put on a song you like and try work out what key it is in, and jam over it. Use a scale/chord book for reference if you need it to learn what notes fit in what keys.

luxury_banana,TheRedPill,1390008406.0,"Ok so the guy has all of the traits that we acknowledge work. Height, body build, natural good looks. There's no controversy surrounding that. You should notice the most common piece of advice no matter where you sit on these issues is: *Work out* (get aesthetics) -- there's a reason for that.

Let's try a thought experiment here though: Do you think Patrice would have been seen to have had as much ""game"" without his money or fame? In other words, without those traits we know also work, would a man like Patrice be seen as anything other than a loudmouth?

The whole process entails what you're presenting run through a filter of cognitive bias with the big things like your looks and socioeconomic status/fame/whatnot coloring the rest of what people, but especially women, think of you. And if we're being honest, having so-called ""charm"" along with money doesn't seem to rank as high as just being good looking, it seems to be a recipe to be beta bux'd if that's all you have is the money/attitude. There's a reason so many women want to fuck the Brad Pitt's, George Clooney's and so on of the world rather than the Danny DeVito's of Patrice O'Neal's of the world.

This is why I can't take *Game True Believers‚Ñ¢* seriously. The same way I can't take *Free Market True Believers‚Ñ¢* or *Communism True Believers‚Ñ¢* and a host of others seriously. They have a completely ideological worldview that is, at best, 100% ivory tower."

The limit will be how much you recover and are able to lift heavy again. Extra volume either from high rep sets or added accessory lifts will do more to prevent you from recovering than they will contribute to you getting stronger.

It's always fun thinking of things though so I'll give some ideas for all the strength heroes here

Sven

- Ult rescaled to 100/175/250, dying resets cd (includes dying with aegis)

Kunkka

- Damage blocked by rum isn't dealt after buff duration, boat stuns any unit it passes over

Alchemist

- Bonus hp regen rescaled from 50/75/100 to 100/150/200

Treant

- Ult duration changed to 5 seconds at all levels, 50% of all damage dealt to entangled target is given back to attacker's health (think open wounds)

IO

- Wisp can cancel the trigger/cancel the return portion of the ultimate at any time

Centaur

- Slow effect changed to 1.5 second stun

Timbersaw

- Chakram travel speed increased from 900 to 1400, cooldown reduced from 8 seconds to 6 seconds

Bristleback

- Damage reduction from the side same as damage reduction from the back

Tusk

- Critical damage changed to 4x (5x if target health less than 50%), cd changed from 30/24/18 to 8s

Elder Titan

- Earth splitter slow duraction increased to 6s at all levels. Enemies effected by slow are effected by the current level of Natural Order (aura is applied before ult damage)

Earth Spirit

- Stone Remnants replaced with fully controlable warlock golems. Retain all interactions with Earth Spirit's spells

Legion Commander

- Cooldown reduced to 10 seconds

Slardar

- Armor reduction changed from 10/15/20 to 20/25/30

Tidehunter

- Stun duraction increased to 3.5 seconds, cooldown reduced to 100 seconds

Wraith King

- WK is magic immune and hasted for 5s after revival. Mana cost requirement removed

Lifestealer

- Lifestealer can infest an enemy hero, dealing double damage to the infested target when using consume and healing for 100% of the damage dealt

Lycanthrope

- Duration increased to 30 seconds, Lycanthrope becomes phased for duration

Chaos Knight

- Illusions do not take increased damage

AFormidableContender,PurplePillDebate,1390008679.0,"&gt;Although I'm not one, most feminists I have encountered agree that women and men are different. But intragender variance is shown to be higher than intergender variance on a number of topics (easiest one I can think of; sexual orientation and restriction).

Do you have an article or paper from a feminist source stating they believe men and women are fundamentally different? Because one of the primary tenants of feminism, as far as I understand it's proponents is feminist blank-slatism: the notion that the male and female human are perfectly identical save their genitalia and physical body structure. This concept is championed in almost all female centric subreddits, and cultures, the most prominent being /r/AskWomen.

&gt;the Nice Guy phenomena, caused by the earlier loss of parental guidance

I disagree.

&gt;Do you think women are given the tools in this aspect or are they taught to be conflict-avoidant?

Women have dramatically lower testosterone; they are naturally conflict avoidant/risk averse, but I would certainly say women are taught/reinforced to be conflict avoidant and risk averse. 

&gt;Unless you give someone the tools, you are leaving them in the dark. And how did the redpill exactly say ""See, women and men are different, we were right in our assertion that women should be submissive and stay at home"" I have no idea?

That's not a scientific assertion TRP is making. TRP is a world view and a code of ethics and concepts at the end of the day. Either a good portion of proving TRP right or wrong would require honest self reporting for scientific studies to be conducted, and that's basically impossible, or the theories that would have to be researched are so violently counter-culture it will likely stay that way.

&gt; The Middle Linebacker drops into Cover 3 coverage against the pass.

Yea, already said that.  Again Has nothing to do with corners.

&gt; The corners have a greater responsibility against the run. That's why there was talk about Darrelle Revis potentially not fitting into Lovie's system because he's ""not a Tampa-2 cornerback"".

The corner's responsibility in a Tampa 2 or Cover 2 are no different, both vs. the pass or rush.  People say Revis isn't a good fit because he is a man coverage corner, not a zone coverage corner, again nothing to do with 4-3/3-4.  

&gt; And its a single-gap run defense. They're very different.

The 4-3 alignment is a single gap system, the 3-4 alignment is a 2 gap system.  You can run a Cover 2/Tampa 2 out of the 4-3 or 3-4 just the same.  Just like you can run a Cover 1, 3, 4, quarters, etc.  Those are all coverages and are completely independent of the front 7 alignment."

In FF5 my only quibble was you often had to choose between a second job command and a passive ability - FF9's passive abilities you unlocked through gear enhanced your abilities and stuck around when you mastered them. While the method by which you learn them is different the effect is the same.

10-2 it's more the stylization of the battle system - the emphasis on customization of jobs and coming up with odd combinations (Garment Grids). FF5 didn't really give you any sort of guidance or inherently encourage experimentation, but FF10-2 and BD seem to celebrate it more openly.

Show that the entire state poses a grave danger to the stability and safety of our country because of ingrained societal homophobia nourished by the strange teachings of the Mormon Church. Point out that the LDS's interference in California's deliberation on Proposition 22 (2000) was a wakeup call to the nation. Remind your audience that the real terrorists are the ones living in our back yard, and they will stop at nothing - not even vigilante assassinations - to further their agenda of world domination. Remind them of what Mormonism teaches its minions about the fate of the globe and the role of Mormons in the future world society. Tell them the Justice Department is of no help. The National Guard is of no help. The citizens of the United States are left with no choice but to infiltrate the state, seize and partition it, carrying on guerilla warfare in the mountains if necessary, to nip this pernicious movement in the bud.

I, for one, would never want my bf to walk around in his underwear in front of my girl friends because I don't want them fantasizing about him or sexualizing him unnecessarily, whether it's harmless or not, just as I would not walk around in my underwear in front if his roommate or friends. 

The whole argument about underwear and bathing suits and yadda yadda is ridiculous. When you go out with a group of people or have them over to hang at your house, you're wearing clothes. If you go to the beach, you're wearing swimwear. It all depends on the activity the group is taking part in. 

As far as the roommate thing, he lives there. If he wants to walk around in HIS place of residence and be comfortable, then he has every prerogative to do so. But, I would ask him to keep some pants on when she's at your house out of respect for y'alls relationship. Many a time have I seen a wayward testicle or penis tip poking out from one's boxers because of how loose they are. "

Celebreth,AskHistorians,1390009162.0,"Just a couple of corrections here :)

First off, on this bit: 

&gt; When ever the Romans turtled up to avoid the archers, the Parthian Pikemen would attack to great effectiveness, or the Cataphracts would charge. This demonstrates that the Testudo, while having its effective uses is not the field formation that made the Romans a feared opponent. It was handy in a siege, and a sure fire way to avoid a rain of arrows though.

Just for clarification, at Carrhae, **the Parthians had no infantry.** The modern conception of ""pikemen"" is ""men on foot with pikes,"" while Dio refers to the Kataphraktoi - the cataphracts used by Parthia. One interesting tidbit is that the force that engaged Rome was actually only meant to be a delaying force - it wasn't expected to crush Crassus' army as efficiently as it did ;) 

---

Secondly, this bit.

&gt; Lastly, it has to be said that Maniple or no, the Romans could adapt and often triumphed by doing so. At Zama where they defeated Hannibal, they stretched their formation out in a line, in order to envelop the Carthaginians, a trick that had been used on them at Cannae. So in one of their pivotal victories, they didn‚Äôt need a Maniple to beat Hannibal. 

Ooookay, got a few problems here. First off, the manipular legion, while it was far more flexible than a phalanx, *was still a rather rigid system*. The standard Roman soldier was a farmer - a citizen-soldier, recruited for one season before he was discharged. Every time an army was formed, it had to be completely re-trained, and was essentially ""green."" These armies had one formation - the famed *triplex acies*. For the vast majority of these armies, there was one formation and one formation only.

However, when it came to extremely gifted commanders who had their forces for years at a time (Scipio Africanus, for example, who used the survivors of Cannae as the core of his army in Africa), they were able to not only establish that trust between men and commander, but they were able to use those men in more novel ways. However, the way you described Zama is...completely incorrect. The Romans didn't ""extend their line and envelop the Carthaginians"" - in fact, the battle was more of a brawl than anything else. After the elephants had been dealt with by the (extremely well drilled and trained) *velites*, the heavy infantry got to fighting, with each commander using an extremely similar formation. Hannibal and Scipio both used a three line formation while their cavalry fought - however, Hannibal's only veterans were in the third line of his formation. First line fought first line, the Carthaginians began to waver, so Hannibal sent in his second line. Then the Roman line began to waver, so Scipio sent in his *principes*. Then both lines backed off, with the Carthaginians almost routing. Both generals reformed their men into one line and sent them against each other - and then, the victorious Roman (Numidian) cavalry returned to hit Hannibal in the rear, shattering his army. Pretty straightforward - but contrary to your quote. the maniples were *essential* in this victory, seeing as they were used to create channels for the *velites* to lure the Carthaginian elephants. The difference, as I noted earlier, was that they were a disciplined military force, able to return to standard formation *after* the manuever - something that, again, required quite a bit of training ;)

Cannae was a completely different creature - and Hannibal **didn't** stretch out his lines to envelop Rome, so much as he made the flanks extremely deep. The Romans bunched their forces into a hammer to shatter his centre, which *almost* worked, but Hannibal was able to conduct a fighting retreat, bowing his line and allowing the Libyans on the flanks to completely envelop the Romans. Hannibal's victorious (Numidian) cavalry came in on the rear, effectively finishing the boxing in. "

rising_son,Guitar,1390009274.0,"I see a lot of talk about this around this sub, and wanted to clear a few things up about intonation:

1. NO guitar in the world with straight frets can possible have perfect intonation.

2. The ""temperament"" of the instrument is a ""best fit"" and the frets are fitted straight in the most optimal position for all notes on the fingerboard.

3. Intonation is affected by everything... literally everything you could think of.... frets wear down with age, so the string has to stretch more to fit them, so is thus pulled sharper; the very action of fretting a note stretches the string, this sharpening it slightly (ever held a chord down with one finger pressing too hard? sounds out of tune right?).

4. It is best to set your intonation as best you can at the octave and above as this is often where notes will sound most out of tune (12th fret and above). However, some of your lower frets will ALWAYS play out of tune. No matter how hard you try to adjust your intonation, this is due to the placement of the frets.

5. Can the human ear hear the difference in an incorrectly intonated guitar? Yes, I know that I can, as my musical ear is very highly trained and my sense of pitch is perfect, however to some it may not be.

It is highly likely that the fresh strings have different tension therefore respond differently to the pressure of fretting, thus play slightly out of tune, however this should not be a significant amount. If your action at the 12th fret is very high you may be pulling the notes out of tune just by the action of fretting the note, although this can be true for any fret.

So much misinformation in this thread, thought I should clear it up."

Drakkanrider,sex,1390009349.0,"I don't have that particular fetish, but my bf and I recently had a similar sexual epiphany we've been exploring.  We were having mostly guy on top sex for a while, because he needs quick movement to cum and I couldn't be fast enough on top to make it happen.  But he was having some performance anxiety when he wad in control.  He always wanted to make me cum first and felt bad when he didn't last long enough (much like you).  I, on the other hand, felt pressured to cum quickly which, of course, just made it stressful and more difficult for me.

We decided at some point to explore making him cum with me on top, and with some effort I was able to make it happen.  And I liked it.  I liked being the one in control.  I liked knowing that I could make myself feel good and be able deal with him after.  And he gets really turned on by my cumming, and is less stressed because he knows I'm in control of who cums when and he doesn't have to worry about it so he can just lay back and enjoy.

We've started exploring some other things related to encouraging my dominance in bed.  I'm now the more active partner in foreplay and turning him on turns me on more than him focusing on me could ever do.

So, we had a similar though less severe problem than yours.  Our solution was different, but we''re both enjoying it quite a bit!"

supercircinus,MakeupAddicts,1390009424.0,"I've tried it!  I preferred R1, but by the time I came back, it was already switched with the revamped line and R1 had been discontinued.  R10 is one of my favourite violet/pinky violets!  (I have an extra ;_; my life is a mess) 

It's a really beautiful shade of red.  True red.  the CdP extra rich formula is one of my favourites because it's so SO lightweight, I forget I have it on my lips! 

The Rouge Clair is a pretty gorgeous red as well, the formula is extremely long wearing, but I've had the same deal where my lips get a little dry when I wear the lippie for more than a school day. 

Rouge Dior is a pretty ""classic"" lipstick formula, but I don't recall it drying out my lips and I wore it for a full day at the fair!  It's not as light weight as CdP and LP, it's very buttery, and just kind of nostalgic for me as I have a tube of my mother's Dior from like, ten years ago (purely aesthetic it's definitely mucky inside!)  

As I said, the lip maestros are so drying :( It was really disappointing, I feel that it's so difficult to rock the matte lip when you have such dry lips :(( but red velvet is a gorrrgeous deeper red. 400, the red is a truer red, but for that kind of red that's matte I prefer the Sephora creme lip stain (although I'm not a fan of Sephora as a store :( )    

I have the Elizabeth Arden ceramide lipstick which is supposed to be massively hydrating, I don't think it's super hydrating, but it certainly not drying.  I have the lipstick and lipgloss in a red shade and I quite like both.  

UGH I'm SO glad that I've found someone who also dislikes Chanel.  I just can't.  I think their mascaras are useless.  And I agree, I have two of the powders and it's not all that better.  In fact, I might prefer my dinky Coty one to it. :/// I just do NOT get the hype.

It has not been proven than every single human being can achieve personal happiness and well-being by nurturing/loving others (and acting with love in all things is a lot more than nurture, but that is besides the point I was trying to make. Don't get caught up in my choice of example - is it relevant if I think I believe something, unaware that it had been proven? It's the process behind right/wrong that we're talking about).

I don't think this will ever be proven (not in my life time, at least), nevertheless I hold it to be true. It is spirituality in the sense that I act according to those beliefs. According to something which has not been proven - not even in my own mind - and yet I choose to hold as true regardless. I have faith in the sense that I will continue to hold those beliefs, and act upon them, despite any seeming evidence to the contrary.

I'm fine with this because of another belief, which is how I behave towards other people is more important that being right or wrong about the human brain."

He'll call what shot he wants, sometimes before the play is even over, and I'll go back to the spot (usually about 2 seconds before the snap) where the replay will start from and wait for his mark.  When he calls the replay to go, I hit the play button and can work the speeds to speed it up, for a long run, or slow it down for a particularly big hit or a controversial call so everyone can get a good look at it.

We were dating for 4 months and she asked if she could call me her step mom!! NO. 

She was also very badly behaved, but I didn't really say anything to her because she wasnt my kid so I felt it wasnt my place, but god was it embarrassing when we'd go places and she'd throw a tantrum and go running all around the store/restaurant screaming and carrying on like a toddler. Her father would do nothing, say ""c'mon, please knock it off!"", or bribe her with candy/toys to get her to shut up. i suggested that she might have adhd and maybe she should see a doctor and he said ""I'm not putting her on medication!"" and the conversation was over.

If I were to do it again, there would have to be no baby's mom issues, and the kid better be reasonable behaved/disciplined and preferably below the age of 5.

edit: i dont have kids, im in my mid twenties and am open to having my own in the future.

I tell her we need to trust eachother to talk openly or we'll build resentment sweeping things under the rug. She responded to that saying she didnt care. The next week things reached a tipping point. She for a long ttime asked me to change ssome issues I had and worked on them with me, and now hhere she is a year later not eeven willing to acknowledge we were growing apart. She proceeded to then just dump a ton of shit she had never ever mentioned bothered her, some of which I straight asked her about in the past.

AFormidableContender,PurplePillDebate,1390009830.0,"&gt;That was the context of the topic though = Nice Guys. Guys who chase women in X way when they should be doing it in Y way or whatever. I want to know what that has to do with virtue, and why the fact that women dont respond to X way makes them non-virtuous.

If women were as virtuous as men, you would see a greater distribution of more types of value/characteristics winning over sexual partners. Men are far more likely to chose a less attractive partner because they like some specific quality about her than women are to do the same.

&gt;So women dont have close friends?

I never claimed women don't have close friends. I don't know where this is coming from. 

&gt;I'm not sure what an example of a guy being cool towards another guy he presumably wasn't sexually attracted to means in the context here.

It's relevant because~ Men are far more likely to chose a less attractive partner because they like some specific quality about her than women are to do the same.

&gt;What would you call that assessment of ""the package"" if not value?

If you buy computer technology based purely on the speed of the processor, and nothing else, you are likely to make poor decisions fairly consistently. Opting for a slower processor, but leveridging that with more RAM, or a better graphics cards is a better deal, aka, value.

&gt;You've never encountered a woman who just wanted to fuck for the sake of fucking?

Sure I have. I have never encountered an attractive woman who fucked just anyone simply because she was horny. Attractive people have options. Why would a horny 9 fuck a 2 when she can get another 9 fairly easily. Having sex with a 2 gets her nothing, including validation and pleasure, which is what is desirable about casual sex. 

&gt;This is difficult to parse because it seems like you're using really arbitrary definitions of ""value""

Value is defined as any trait that would be socio-sexually advantageous and desired amongst the opposite gender or other people. For women, it's almost only ever their physical appearance. For men, it's usually A) physical success (fitness), B) social success (social respect/leadership) and C) economic respect (good, validating job). Other things can factor in depending on your situation in life...the host of parties has value, the one guy in your group of friends with a car who drives everyone everywhere has value, the teacher in a classroom has more value than his students by default, etc. 
 
&gt;Who places more emphasis on personality?

Men.

&gt;Who would take a douchy/axe murder 9 over a nice 6? Men, women or both?

Women and unattractive men.

ebonlance,Warmachine,1390010121.0,"Basically, during a model's activation they get to make their movement, then make an action. 

**EDIT** I should probably make something really clear: when a model activates, you get its movement, **then** its action. It has to make its movement before attacking or making an action unless they have a special rule that says otherwise (Bushwhack, Hog Wild), or some other spell or effect lets them move out of activation (Vengeance, Bullet Dodger, Enliven)

That action can be used in several ways:

- The most common option is to take initial melee attacks, which is one attack with each weapon on your card (melee or ranged). After making initial melee attacks, you can buy more attacks with focus.

- Special attacks work the same way, but you make them in place of initial attacks, so you only do what the attack says instead of making an attack with each weapon on the card.

- Power attacks are another option. Throws, headbutts, weapon locks, and whatnot also take the place of initial attacks, but you can buy extra attacks with focus after making one.

- Special actions use up your action, but unless the action specifically says so you **can't** buy more attacks after using them. You make special actions after your movement."

Play a 40hz tone at one notch under max volume on your head unit, and set the gain by ear, turning the gain up until the subs aren't getting louder as you turn the gain up, then back it down a bit.

ricree,AskMen,1390010516.0,"&gt;I think it would get draining living on essentially guard duty for the whole duration of your posting.

If that bothers you that much, you could knock the date back a decade and take part in Trajan's very successful conquest of Dacia and Parthia.

&gt; And not have lost all their conquests in the short time that they did

Excepting Trajan's conquests, the borders were fairly stable from the end of the Julio-Claudians up until the late antiquity. That's centuries of stability, and not a short time by any stretch.

&gt;They could have eventually conquered a lot more.

The big issue they had was political will. Emperors had a real hard time trusting their generals to make huge, popular conquests. The empire's borders were roughly in their final form by the time Augustus died. There were a bunch of smaller client states that were folded into the empire during the rest of the dynasty, but no big changes, with two exceptions.

The first being England, done during the time of an empire who was either weak-willed (if you accept the classical historians), or reluctant (if you go by more recent imaginings).

The other being Trajan, who led the campaigns himself. Hadrian could have almost certainly held on to Trajan's Persian conquests, but it would have meant personally staying there on campaign for years, and there were clearly other things he'd rather be doing with his time.

Considering how big a role Persia played in Rome's eventual fall, it's interesting to imagine what might have happened if he'd insisted on holding what Trajan had taken.

&gt;Who cares about a plague in the future though.

I mean that there's a distinct possibility that it would happen during your lifetime if you were living in the latter part of the Antonine dynasty. Sure, you wouldn't know ahead of time, but we're talking something that wasn't all *that* far off from the black plague."

ctesibius,motorcycles,1390010526.0,"As /u/chainsaw-on-wheels says, you need a manual. However if you've got the manual, can I suggest that you try something else before changing the tensioner? You *must* check the details in the manual, as I don't know your bike. However most cam-chain tensioners operate the same way. There is a spring-loaded piston and a ratchet to stop it backing off. Sometimes that spring is too weak, but you can actually open up the tensioner and give the piston a prod with a screwdriver to take up the excess slack. This is easier than changing the camchain tensioner and carries less risk.

Ok, how do you do it? Well, again, you *must* check a manual to see how the thing is assembled, but usually there is a large bolt in the centre of the external part of the tensioner. Remove that (there may be a spring underneath, in which case pull that out as well), insert a largish screwdriver, and push to take up the slack (say about 5lb of force), then put the bolt (and spring) back in. Now start the engine and see if it still rattles."

DaEvil1,technology,1390010866.0,"The lack of titles, is because of multiple delays because they've experienced troubles specifically with transitioning to HD. If they hadn't experienced those delays, they would have released mroe of the games that are currently in the pipeline for to be released and titles like Pikmin 3 would have been a launch title instead of coming out almost a year later.

Well sure. But if you want to just look at singular ds models, the ds lite outsold ALL GBA models combined. And if you want to be consistent, you should use that same argument for GBA that you are using for DS, which means that GBA's most sold model, the GBA SP, sold ""only"" 43 million copies as compared to the DS lite which sold 93 million. So again, you are wrong.

You have little understanding if you think that selling  150 million mobile systems over 9 years over one generation, is worse than selling 80 million mobile systems over the previous generation of systems. 

My post is based on facts, you have not backed up a single thing you've said with any facts aside from trying to give an impression of ""being in the business"". I don't know how else to say this, but the Nintendo DS systems are the BEST SELLING DEDICATED MOBILE GAMING SYSTEMS IN HISTORY. There are no feelings involved there, and if you seperate it into models, the DS Lite ALONE still outsold ALL THEIR PREVIOUS EFFORTS unless you combine the Gameboy and Gameboy colors sales numbers into one."

Personally, I think online dating is alright. I've never used it, so I have no real opinion on it's reliability. But there are people who meet through online dating websites, and I think it's very beneficial as compared to dating in real life. Dating ""offline"" usually happens between friends, or friends of friends, or classmates, etc. I think online dating actually allows those kind of boundaries to be broken. You would meet people in another town over that you wouldn't have ever met before, and neither have you met any of their friends. It allows you to expand the circle of people you know, get different perspectives on life. Where someone in college would (usually) be around other academics, you could meet someone in a trade school or someone that works full time at a church. It is most definitely a result of our advances i technology, and I believe it is a beneficial one at that."

legal_beagle,ABraThatFits,1390011070.0,"In my experience, Elomi's bands ran fairly true to size, but their cups tended to run large.  For example, when I was a 34H in Elomi, I was a pretty reliable 34HH in most other brands (including Curvy Kate).  So you may need to size up to 36HH.

The bigger issue you may run into is that of shape.  Generally Elomis are fairly wide, but also pretty deep.  Curvy Kates are wide as well, but their shape in general tends to be a little more shallow.  I understand that in the last year they've tried to improve that (some of their models were REALLY shallow), but I think they're still a good deal shallower than Elomi.  

You may want to compare measurements on bratabase - for instance, if you know the Elomi Caitlyn (for example) fits you in a 36H, look at the CK bras to see how their measurements compare.  You can get a good idea of how width and depth compare that way and see if you'd need to size up at all."

Also, it takes a long time for me to gain friends.  I really try to scope people out and know what I'm getting into before I really get close to someone, and with all the other things that are going on in my life, that's pretty tough to do some days!

Couple that with a severe anxiety disorder, a panic disorder, depression and a crippling self-image problem, and you get someone who's pretty damn tired by the end of the day.  It made me stop doing the sport I loved, it made me lose weight and become super high strung and unpredictable.    

I've only ever had one girlfriend I've ever cared about (sorry K, but middle school!) and we had a nasty breakup because long distance just don't work.  I'm not a kissless virgin, but yeah.  And I'm in *college*, for fuck's sake.  I'm too scared and I have no clue what I'm doing in terms of dating in college.  I have no car, so I can't drive to dates (got bank, tho!  College doesn't let fish have cars) and I don't know what to do.  I'm terrible at asking girls out, and I'm so terribly shy sometimes I'll find a way to squirm out of a date just because I'm scared.  Hell, even on senior Prom, I almost turned around and drove home before I picked up my girlfriend.  

Man, I miss having friends.  Every night last semester I'd eat dinner alone in a big dining hall.  I really don't like parties.  I'm sort of antisocial and I really don't enjoy being drunk or high, so that cuts my parties down by well over 3/4.  The most social interaction I get is in class.

In my Chem lab, for instance.  I was always so happy to go to Chem lab.  Why?  *She* was there.  The second week, she didn't have a partner, I didn't have a partner so we worked together and we really hit it off.  We'd just chat and do lab work for two hours and the time would fly by.  When class came around, she would always find me in the 250-person lecture hall and would sit next to me and on the cold days at the end of the semester she would always get so close to me, man.  SO close.  I loved it.  

And I threw it away.  At the end of the semester, we started drifting apart.  The killer was we were studying together and she was cuddled up with another guy.  She grabbed him and made an excuse about watching GoT and skipped off with him.  It fuckin' killed me.  I just sat there and died a little inside.

So yeah.  I guess I got a little off topic there.  As soon as I make some new friends and get a crush on a new girl, I'll be fine, and move on with my life.  I guess these things just take time, and I have plenty of time.  I already made friends with some guys in my hall, so I guess maybe I can hang out with them.  I'm a little homesick, yeah, but that'll go back away as the semester progresses.  I can always call my parents, but I can't pet my dogs over the phone!

piratelibrarian,TwoXChromosomes,1390011128.0,"You are so rockin' the pencil skirts. Love that. 

I'm *really* colour and texture sensitive, so my feedback comes from that place:

I feel like both top choices are too heavy. The green brocade number would look amazing with a fitted, high-collared blouse with just a bit of ruffle at the top or a cashmere sweater with a scoop neck - in a light colour, either way. champagne and blush type colours would work well, especially with your skin tone. Black on deep green just reminds me of a bruise (and some folks are way into bruise couture with the darks on darks, maybe you are, I ain't). 

Again with the heavy top: I would ditch the vest from the second outfit and wear the scarf from the first with it and the blouse. It would give it contrast and edge without all of that up top heaviness.

Hemlines: skirt from the first outfit is almost perfect, the second one could stand to be taken up an inch. Skirt #2 cuts you off at the knee and that's no fun. You've got amazing legs. Show that shit off.

You could totally pull off flared gored skirts/dresses in mini or maxi lengths and those are things you can swing in with menswear easily (I shop from both the femmes et hommes section on the reg, so I'm a bit good with this). 

At the end of the day, you look great and look like you feel great. Wear what makes you feel good. I know I totally don't wear what I know accentuates my bod the best all the time. So, take my advice, I ain't using it ;)"

FountainsOfFluids,scifi,1390011257.0,"Meh. I've been a sci-fi and action film fan all my life, and I can tell you exactly why Pacific Rim lost me. With very few exceptional moments, it had almost no sense of the enormity and power of the kaiju and jaegers. Just compare it to the previews of the new Godzilla movie. The scale of the creature is palpable. If Gareth Edwards is smart, he will work very hard to maintain the sense of how mind blowingly massive it is.

Look at it this way. You know how we all hate when in a tv show the detective is handed a cup of coffee that is obviously empty? It's the same thing on a much larger scale. Yes, I can see that the big monster is smashing a building, but I didn't *feel* it. It's subtle things, just like the way a person handles a cup of coffee that is full of hot liquid vs full of air.

The camera angles were wrong a lot of the time. Shots of the big monsters from above and head height completely robbed the audience of a frame of reference. Those shots should have been rare, but they were very common. It was too much fan service, and it leads the viewer past the stage of awe to the stage where we feel like it's a guy in a suit on a sound stage with a miniature city.

The environment was destroyed too easily. I know that concrete is hard, so when it gets shredded or turned to dust with a simple swipe of the tail, that makes it look hollow and fake. If I was to step on a house of cards, my foot would just go straight through it. But if I was to step on something with a little more stiffness like a stack of shoe boxes, there would be some resistance, even if my full weight eventually crushed the stack flat. Even if you do all the math and determine that a kaiju wouldn't notice the overpass he crashes through, when I see it on screen I have to see the toughness of it or it becomes outside of my range of understanding, and therefor becomes fake looking. When the jaeger picked up a ship to swing it like a bat, I just didn't believe that the ship would maintain it's shape moving in an manner like that. I expected it to split apart like the titanic when it sank. That's my frame of reference for very large things in the real world, and when that frame of reference is defied, you lose me as a viewer.

And finally, the piloting of the jaegers looked like they had a serious lack of force feedback. The pilots were often performing movements in a split second that would have taken the mech a couple seconds to perform. It looked like there was some of that, but again it was inconsistent, and unrealistic.

Like I said, there were a few moments in the film where they nailed it, but overall it just wasn't there, and I had to seriously just suspend that disbelief in order to enjoy the action.

Still, I doubt that the nominating committee is thinking the same way I am. So the lack of nominations is probably intentional in some way."

Abracadanielle,TheBluePill,1390011276.0,"I have NEVER encountered the pearl-wringing attitude towards women cutting their hair in real life the way I have on the internet. Me and all my female friends have rocked both short and long hair at some point or another, and to my knowledge, NO ONE has gotten shit from their SO or anyone else in their life because of it. If anything, I've seen women who went shorter than they intended and didn't like it, and overwhelming were told ""Oh it looks great! Plus it'll grow back!""

I'm gonna go ahead and call this Short Hair Privilege. Maintaining the sort of long, luxurious hair TRPers seem to lust after is fucking expensive as well as incredibly time consuming. When men are socially expected to do an equivalent amount of beauty maintenance to women, then maybe they'll have some room to make such demands of the general population. I'm also gonna assume that these are the same guys who also insist their partners shave their legs, armpits and crotches, tweeze/maintain their eyebrows, be good enough at makeup that they look like they're not wearing any and probably also dress appropriately feminine at any given time. *Then* they get mad when the type of women who maintain this lifestyle might want things in return like, oh, dinner dates and such for all their trouble."

arichi,AskReddit,1390011465.0,"&gt; they were suing farmers who hadn't purchased anything from Monsanto, but wind had cross pollinated them from other farms who had, 

You'll be pleased to know this is urban legend at best -- a few farmers have pirated Monsanto seeds and been sued, then claimed this, but they had huge fields that were 90+% Monsanto seed, and farmhands testified that they found some and deliberately cultivated it.  In short, not one chance in a billion that it was legit cross-pollination.

It's like this:  suppose you pirate a movie or two and get sued for a ton.  That's pretty bad.  But suppose instead you pirate enough movies - and buy enough DVD-Rs - to open a competitor to Netflix consisting entirely of pirated movies.

&gt;Ein zu einem Titel geh√∂render Artikel kann innerhalb der Anf√ºhrungszeichen stehen, wenn der Titel unver√§ndert bleibt. Wenn der Artikel ge√§ndert wird, steht er au√üerhalb der Anf√ºhrungszeichen

It clearly states that if you don't want to change the article, it should be inside quotation marks, and if you **do** want to change it, it needs to go outside.

So your original, and slightly corrected, sentence would actually be written this way, if you want to be completely correct (but I doubt that even Germans know about this):
&gt; Wenn man eine Zeitung kaufen will, kann man sagen: ‚ÄûIch w√ºrde gern den ,Spiegel‚Äò oder ,der Spiegel‚Äò kaufen‚Äú

OHotDawnThisIsMyJawn,Entrepreneur,1390011893.0,"Start by looking at the market.  It shouldn't be tough to find some prices for similar services.  Given that you have a waitlist already and it's tough to raise prices on existing clients then you should err on the side of pricing too high.  

The other benefits that you get by pricing high are that you communicate to clients that you're valuable and you weed out the people who aren't serious and are just going to jerk you around - two very important things when freelancing.

The other route you could take to pricing would be to figure out what your market salary would be.  Then add in X% for overhead (supplies, bench time, etc) and remember that you're paying double on lots of taxes.  There are plenty of resources out there that will tell you what X should be, I don't know that number off the top of my head."

It made me gain weight (10-15 lbs), i cried about really ridiculous things (both happy and sad crying) all the time, my period was longer and heavier (7 full days, when off the pill its 3 days every other month), i always had spotting and my sex drive was pretty low.

however it really cleared my skin up, made my period more regular over time and i didn't get pregnant, so it had some things going for it!

i would suggest going to your OBGYN and asking to try a different method. I had slightly better luck with the nuva ring, but there are plenty of other options, even lower hormone pills!"

According to my mom, my name just came to her and *felt* right, even though my dad was bent on naming me after *his* mother if I turned out to be a girl.

I feel like the beginning is a bit too slow as I skipped most of pg 3 &amp; 4. Despite the writing being engaging, the party seems kinda weak/cliche. The setting is good, but the party itself lacks uniqueness. I guess that's the point, but I feel like there is a way to make it a little more worth the reader's while.

The journey to the end was a nice slow burn, but the ending didn't feel like a payoff because it comes out of nowhere. I think giving the subconscious moments more voice as the story goes can help the reader sympathize with the main character as he goes through it.

EDIT: I should add, the principle thing that is being compared when the ""players"" are competing is technique; how well someone knows the rules and subsequently, how well they know how to optimize their performance and which strategies to use at which points in the game/match. This is why I would agree that eSports are sports, because there is a tremendous amount of strategy and technique being put to the test, with players that are constantly putting the games and their own mental capacity to the test."

Scarcer,microgrowery,1390012365.0,"Well, it really depends. Cannabis is a hardy weed, but nature didn't intend it to grow 4+ feet with oversized seminilla(sp) flowers.

With that said, the weight of the bud alone can crack branches; and wind storms will break entire flowering plants to the ground.

Regardless, marijuana (especially via clone) needs vertical support to make it grow straight and keep it from leaning under load. If the plant gets over 4 feet tall (especially indica's) will need additional limb support.

Your primary option regardless, since it is illegal is to grow small plants.

A) Grow small potted plants within the protection of a back yard fence. Not entirely protected from the elements, but protected from being torn apart by harsh weather. (Total protection from the elements will guarantee pests/disease.) Only worry about rain when you get closer to harvest.

B) Do a guerrilla grow where the plant will have the protection of trees/Forrest."

But they would bribe me with toys, baseball games, etc, to get me on their good side. My dad wasn't around when I was a kid, and in hindsight I really wanted a male influence, so I was easily won over when any man paid attention to me. Then they would either disappear, or become my mom's bf, then I became superfluous and in the way.
  
My mom's first marriage was to a guy that did this, and she ended up having a daughter with him. This made everything much worse. I'll give him the credit of actually trying to be a father-figure to me before my sister, but once she came around, I was nothing to him. I felt like he, my mom, and my sister made a new family, and even though my mom put in a good effort to include me, I was always treated like I was in the way. They got a divorce in 88', and mom's bf's after him did the same thing. Her second husband was even worse, and ended up beating me to the point of almost hospitalizing me.
  
I saw a post here on Reddit about a guy who proposed to the daughter of his fianc√© after the fianc√© said yes. That really warmed my heart because I wish my mom approached it like that. Once the guy got my mom, there was nothing I could do, and worse off, they had a say in how I was punished, and diverted resources to their child, not me. If I complained about it, then I would get yelled at. This is why I vowed that I would never do this to a child. I will never make a child feel like an alien in his own family. I can't express how alone I felt in those years, with no one on my side. It's fucking awful, and it takes years to get over. I have high hopes for humanity when I see a man proposing to that little girl. We are learning, we are growing, and we're becoming better people."

And about the linemen part, we just have Castonzo and Cherilus as solid guys, and I think that's pretty much it. Thornton was a rookie, and so was Holmes. Both of those rookies did well, though and I have good hopes for them!

Put the roast in the crockpot.  Mix the seasoning packets into the water, then pour it over the roast.  Put the stick of butter on top; it'll melt as the crockpot warms.  Throw in the peppers.  Put it on low for 8 or so hours, or until it's easy to poke through with a fork.

Viewing that type of media is succumbing to that attraction, and I think it's dangerous and inappropriate. I would not be comfortable dating someone with that preference, and not for vanity and jealous reasons like ""does that mean he's less attracted to me because I'm not a teen?"" I don't like it because teenagers being sexualized is a problem and to engage in a medium that perpetuates a teen being exploited is a definite problem."

I've told this story on Reddit before, and I'll tell it again, over and over, because I want people to see me as their kid in the future. Hell, I remember mundane things that a principal or my mom's friend did as if it were yesterday, let alone someone who was close to my mom or always around. Children are sponges soaking up everything, and they can't just ""get over"" things. That stuff lasts for a long time. When I'm around a child, I'm not only careful of what I say, but what I do and how I act. There's no need to sanitize the world, but there's also no need to warp such an easily pliable mind.
  
My advice to you is to understand as much as possible. As you get older, your mom's priorities will shift, and she'll tell you more than you know about what happened. Use this information as insight into where she's coming from. Reasons are not excuses, but reasons will help you understand, and understanding will help you forgive, and forgiveness will help you move on and fix that foundation so you could build a sturdier life on it."

rising_son,Guitar,1390012969.0,"People generally put pedals that affect dynamics at the start of the chain. Usually compression first, then distortion, then other effects like modulation. Putting compression before distortion means that your signal is being ""levelled out"" before it gets fed through the overdrive or distortion, this means that the tone from the overdrive/distortion will be more consistent. Putting the distortion first may result in your quieter notes with less distorted sound being brought up in level closer to that of the sound of notes that you are playing loudly which can create a difference in sound. Basically you are looking to choose between more even dynamics (compressor first) vs more natural overdrive/distortion (OD or distortion first.)"

nukefudge,TrueReddit,1390013046.0,"ooh, that's dangerous territory, distinguishing between ""consciousness"" and ""body"". ;)

i mean, yeah, it's a common metaphorical way of looking at it, what you describe. not without problems, though! and they've basically been there since the topic was kickstarted some thousand years ago.

i wanna say... we need not think of identity in terms of something ""through time"" - because that begs the question: how does this something exist through time? and this is kinda the problem we faced to start with. identity cannot be defined by referring to something that needs identity itself.

we have this obstacle of ""change"" that we often let get in the way of our thinking. if we don't think of identity (or for that matter, mind/body, or _life_ in general) as being somehow null and void in the face of _change_, we might be able to come up with some better models. there's no reason to suppose that identity will somehow live up to this rudimentary notion of ""objecthood"", that is, something that persists or endures. but that doesn't mean ""identity"" becomes an empty term. it just means we'll have to define it in a broader perspective. it's not just a _simple_ aspect of something, it's very relational, and manifests in several ways.

you're not you because you're ""tied to yourself"", you're you because the things you do, the situations you enter into, are (more or less) connected via history. or in a more generic sense, there are _patterns of meaning_ that your existence encompasses.

something like that. i can feel my eyes getting tired so i'll have to stop for now."

Veranek,ADHD,1390013054.0,"I'm actually trying this same experiment right now. I've been on Concerta for years. The huge downside is the nicotine addiction. My battery for the ecig died a few days ago and I stressed over it so much. Ended up buying another one as soon as I could. My hands trembled.

As a stimulant it's great, because I can just smoke up a bit before class it actually calms me down, but I'm really considering quitting because it's ridiculously addictive. I smoke like 2 mg of juice today, which I had never done before. 

My verdict: please refrain. Maybe do some exercise? I do both, and I feel that running a few miles in the morning is much better than using nicotine. I hope it helps. 

If you do decide to try, be careful and honest with yourself. I tend to rationalize irrational things, and ecigs are irrational. There are better ways. I'm quitting next week."

Dotura,technology,1390013102.0,"Negative for me: The god awful search function in win8(improved greatly with 8.1). Wanting to use anything metro related without an account is not possible and if you do make a throwaway one you need to use that for all the metro things, forget having a different login on skype or one that comes pre-windows skype. I'm also having lots of weird bugs like 'recently used' shortcuts being permanently stuck. After format i got a new sound bug where front and back sound don't auto change when i plug something in the front sometimes it does but only half in half(vids have audio in headset but gameplay on speakers etc.). There is no 'use offline account' option, you need to first enter an account with the whole @ crap and then just write a bogus password. Only then it will give you the option to continue without one since you might have 'forgotten' your password.




Plus side: The task manager is really pretty and informative, i like that one. win-key + f for searching (8.1) and how i could plug my xbox controller in and it worked straight away was very handy. 

I'm sure some of the mistakes are just my fuck ups and can easily be fixed if you do some weird win8 trick or it already was fixed in 8.1."

I of course froze up and started shaking. The dog kept closing in and just as he was about to jump on me, my 5 year old cousin - yes he was younger than I am - just comes at him with a huge metal rod and just clobbers him on the top of his head, between his ears. The dog just starts running away, whimpering.

I'm not sure what age range you're targeting here. Kids born in the mid-90s?

Looking a bit older, Boston teams weren't *that* terrible. In 1986, the Pats appeared in the Super Bowl and the Sox made it to the World Series. The Celtics took home a lot of conference championships in the 80s.

Of course, the Pats were shellacked by Da Bearsssss and Boston fans still twitch when you say ""Buckner"" in their presence, but it wasn't *all* bad.

And let's not forget that for a lot of the years that the Pats were forgettable at best, the Giants weren't exactly good either."

It really depends on the people and who they become while doing those things. It took me a long time to realize that being drunk didn't automatically make someone obnoxious, overly loud, or overly rude because the only people I had really ever been around that got drunk were my older sister and my mom. My sister is an alcoholic, and my mom is super buddy-buddy with her, so basically feeds off of and contributes to that monster.

On the other hand, many of my friends (who are not alcoholics) don't turn into assholes, get loud, and be obnoxious when they drink.

while this is true, [if you were to get murdered, you're statistically more likely to be stabbed](http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/facts/1-20/2012/2_profiles.html)(scroll down to figure 11). actually, twice as likely to be stabbed than shot. again, just because you can't get a gun doesn't mean you can't be killed. 

this is why gun control doesn't save lives. 

[here's from the aussie crime bureau](http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/341-360/tandi359/view%20paper.html) figure. 1. take a look at the murder rates since the reactionary legislation in the late 90s. ignore the bullshit downward sloping line put in to draw your eyes in a downward trend and look at the chart. the murder rate hasn't changed in any noticeable way. 20, 30 people a year? out of 23million? and all those tax dollars going down the drain to enforce something that has had no marked affect on the safety of its people. 

i think after 16 years, your country has enough data to show that it has not in fact decreased murder, it simply decreased firearm murder. that's like getting rid of planes because their crashes are less survivable and saying you saved lives while the car crash mortality rate goes up due to people driving more instead of flying. bureaucracy at its finest.

Same goes for gay marriage, I opposed it just because my parents told me to, then when I developed more critical thinking skills I became very supportive of gay rights.  After I stopped being so damn bigoted, I started to realize I was a little bi-curious.  

Feminism.  I used to be apathetic to it because I thought it just meant wanting the right to vote or something.  When I discovered /r/mensrights I became completely antifeminist.  Then after doing research from less *biased* sources I realized that r/mr is a pretty terrible place to learn about feminism and became a feminist.

Can you add more info about what sort of position you're interviewing for?  And maybe give an idea of the size of the company and their funding levels if you know?  Both those things will have a huge impact on the interview process.

Generally though you'll go in, meet with a few people, probably the person who will be your boss and a few of your coworkers.  They'll ask you technical questions, probably have you write some code on a laptop or whiteboard, with a focus on the type of work they do and problems they face (ie if they're a Java shop that's running a B2C site expect to get questions about scaling Java app servers, caching, databases).  The person who will be your boss will probably ask you questions more along the lines of ""what do you want your future to be"" or ""tell me about a time you had trouble with a coworker"".

AnyelevNokova,relationships,1390014135.0,"Hey friend, similar boat! 

My beef is that kids are a heck of a commitment. If you're willing to have a child with me; live with me, parent with me, pay bills and juggle shifts with me, laugh at each others' stupid jokes, wrestle over chores but get them done, go on dates, play video games in our underwear, and spend most of off-duty time together, *what the heck* is marriage going to change? If we're living like a married couple already, and you're comfortable with the family guy lifestyle as we're currently living it, then what does ""I'm not ready yet"" mean, exactly? You're happy with our everything-but-the-M-word relationship. How are you ""not ready yet"" for marriage when we already live our lives like most married couples do? It's not like gravity is going to reverse itself when we sign a piece of paper and trade a couple rings. If you see me as more than a girlfriend, and you want to spend your life with me, I'm pretty sure that is the point where you propose. That's what marriage is: a lifelong commitment to another person because you love them, you work well with them, and you want to build a life together. If you ""aren't ready yet"" to propose, then from where I'm sitting, there is something that is holding you back, and a vague answer just undermines my own confidence in the relationship.

If you love them, work well with them, and want to build a life together, and you both agree that marriage is in the cards, *why not*? What is the trigger that is going to make you go, aha, *now* I'm ready to be married! For someone who is ready to be married and their partner isn't, it's hard to understand why they're not if they can't give you a solid reason other than that they're ""not ready yet."" And it's *extremely* hard to not take it personally. My SO's brother got engaged over Christmas, and I cried in his mother's bathroom while they Skyped and his awful girlfriend flashed her ring giddily. I hid every stupid freaking engagement message and lovey-dovey couple photo or left hand picture that she posted because it just reminded me that my man ""isn't ready yet"" for reasons he can't articulate. His brother was in a relationship for a fraction of how long we've been together and they've spent even *less* time living together. If his brother was ready, why isn't mine? Why is *my* man indecisive? Have I done something wrong? Does he not like me? Is he having doubts? Does he think I'm ugly? He says he loves me, he says he's happy, but he still ""isn't ready"" to formally commit. That must mean I'm doing something wrong. Girls who issue ultimatums get stupid, over-the-top proposals and obnoxiously large rings all the time. What do I get for being patient? ""I'm not ready yet.""

That's like if I said, ""I *might* give you a blowjob"" but never followed through and knowingly ignored you every time you hinted that you wanted one. Eventually, you'd get frustrated because you want what you want and your partner has kind-of-sort-of said they'll do it, but they've waffled over the issue so much that you're starting to wonder if they actually meant it. She knows that getting blowjobs are kind of a deal breaker for you, and you've tried to be patient, but she knows you're getting restless - is she just stringing you along? Telling you what you want to hear so that you'll get your hopes up when she doesn't intend to follow through?

I find myself going out of my way to do nice things for him in the desperate hope that it gets me *somewhere* on the issue. Hell; I'd settle for just a, ""hey, it's coming soon‚Ñ¢"" statement. But ""I'm not ready yet"" is maddeningly vague and indecisive when you've been waiting for, literally, years."

ibbity,TheBluePill,1390014171.0,"I've been a regular visitor to TRP for over a year now, and I've read all of the links in their sidebar multiple times, and talked to many redpillers including the mods. I think that after all this I know a *little* about TRP theory and its bases. 

You said that the base of TRP is ""Men and women are fundamentally different, especially when it comes to mating strategies. Here are some ways you can make yourself a more appealing sexual partner to women"". Now, this is true, but it is also EXTREMELY disingenuous, on the level of the neo-Nazi that y'all had posting neo-Nazi stuff in your sub the other day. You know, the guy who posted the lecture claiming it was by ""a physics professor"" and recommending that you guys seek out his other political works? While conveniently failing to mention that the guy was a legitimate Nazi and white supremacist, or that he himself was these things as well? 

You've failed to mention that the RP ""fundamental difference between men and women"" is that women are considered inferior to men in all ways and are only good to serve men, sexually and domestically. You've failed to mention that the ""mating strategies"" TRP projects onto women are ""Women lie and cheat and are literally incapable of love, and their sole goal is to claw their way up the social order as far as they can by means of gold-digging and whoring, so that they can raise their children on someone else's dime, as they are lazy, shallow and selfish to an insane degree."" (Solipsism, anyone?) You've failed to mention that the ""ways you can make yourself a more appealing sexual partner to women"" as prescribed by TRP are to treat women like dogs (literally and figuratively), to verbally and emotionally manipulate and abuse them, to force them into subservience and submission in everything, to intimidate and control them, to ""smash through last-minute resistance"" and have sex with them even if they say no (as long as they're too intimidated or drunk to fight you off physically, no means yes!), to RAPE them if they are your wife. Not to mention the part where women are supposed to be excluded from intellectual discourse and are not to be permitted to vote or to make any decisions that might affect their man, because that's not their place. 

I can, if you like, pull up *several* links to TRP threads or sidebar links that prove that these are seeply ingrained in the TRP worldview and philosophy. Any of my fellow bluepillers can do the same. So tell me, how is none of this ""inherently misogynistic"" again? "

Why had she never used the controls? Because that car **had no rear heater**. She suspected it, I knew it, and these jokers wanted $500 to replace a part that didn't exist on the car. I even took the writeup to another Dodge dealer to have them verify that the parts quoted were for equipment that I didn't own.

If you go to a funded place (charity, religious affliate, NGO, Govt org, hospital etc) you will probably find that it works on a sliding scale to match your income. Ie: earn less, pay less and vise verse.

Ask your mates if they have seen a counsellor and maybe try them out? I will be honest, the best ones usually make people pay for it - there are many awesome therapists who dont charge much but they are to be found within a sea of psych grads who are looking for the cash and not overly interested in the guts of the work. You can tell a good therapist from the first session and if you dont gel with the therapist you should politely let them know and move on - do not waste time going back hoping that they may pull an ace out!

The best and only real way to know a good therapist is to experience them for yourself - we all have our own styles and they are not suited to everyone.

Normal cost for a session (in Australia) range from about $100-$150 per hour for a couple if seen privately and about $20-$60 if you find a funded program. There are plenty of them in Australia.

Hope this helps brother - I know what it is like to start the search for a therapist, it can feel over whelming. 

Any qs let me know.

xthorgoldx,pics,1390014469.0,"Solar arrays are more promising in the past decade or so, to the point that they're a feasible source of alternative energy, as far as electricity is concerned (after nuclear power). The problem is that the modern world doesn't run on electricity - that is to say, the modern world doesn't run on the things that need elecricity alone to work. The modern world is run by *oil.* You can't run a refinery using electrical heating coils, you need blast furnaces using coal or gas. You can't heat a million homes as efficiently with electricity as with gas, or move a car as efficiently with a battery as a combustion engine (60+ mpg is just offloading the energy cost onto the powerplant, rather than the car). All that, and it's a very space-inefficient form of power. The US Air Force Academy's campus is 25 acres and supports roughly 6,000 people . It has a 30-acre field of solar panels. How much does it get out of a field that size? *10%. of its need.* Now consider how many solar fields you'd need to supply Denver, or New York, or Beijing with even 10% of their power requirements.

Hydroelectric power is a *very* good source of energy, but it comes with a whole slew of environmental issues. When you dam up a river, you throw a spanner in the local ecosystem, especially if it's a spawning route; you screw up the water cycle for the area, seasonal flooding in particular; you also screw up irrigation for anybody downstream and force a good number of people upstream to evacuate (you can build damns that don't create reservoirs, but they're much less efficient). 

My point? Every form of energy comes with a drawback. Wind turbines are ugly, inefficient (for cost), and limited in placement. Hydroelectric disrupts the ecoysystem and local water table. Nuclear produces waste materials. Tidal generators screw up the local water systems. Solar is inefficient as hell for large-scale production. Oil is efficient but polluting. Don't put up one form of energy or another on a pedestal because it's obviously superior because, let's face it, *energy manipulation isn't clean.*"

El3utherios,duelofchampions,1390014575.0,"Playstyle on most heroes are based on their ability, their magic schools and ofc their faction, if you know key fortunes/creatures for each faction, and key spells for each spell school you can sort of imagine how that hero can be played.

Asalah is a bit of a wildcard in academy, having 3 spell schools and OTK potential you never really know what you're up against when facing her. There are 3 popular ways of playing her:

**1: OTK** - One Turn Kill, fill the deck with ""[enchant creature](http://tools.mmdocking.com/cards?search=enchant+creature&amp;fire=1&amp;light=1&amp;water=1)"" spells, [Chain Casting](http://tools.mmdocking.com/images/cards/s03/large/s03_For_Aca_016.jpg), cheap creatures and play until you have an open lane with a creature (eventually a Pao Deathseeker if you can get to 3 might), then pop chain casting and put enough Enchant Creature spells on the creature + Asalah's ability so it gets +20 damage or whatever is needed to kill the enemy hero.


**2: Milling** - Asalah isn't the optimal Academy hero for milling imo, her spell schools allow her to use [Ink Warrior](http://tools.mmdocking.com/images/cards/s03/large/s03_Spe_Wat_052.jpg) on [Void Shades](http://tools.mmdocking.com/images/cards/s03/large/s03_Cre_Aca_031.jpg), she also has access to [Resurrection](http://tools.mmdocking.com/images/cards/b01/large/b01_Spe_Lig_010.jpg) but it's expensive to spend 5 resources to get back a 3 resource creature if you don't have board control.

**3: Ressurection deck** - Academy has the single most powerful creature in the game, [Sentinel of the Ages](http://tools.mmdocking.com/images/cards/s04/large/s04_Cre_Aca_063.jpg), but it's very expensive in terms of requirements and resources. However, with some ingenious use of [Day of Fortune](http://tools.mmdocking.com/images/cards/b01/large/b01_Eve_Neu_006.jpg) and [Resurrection](http://tools.mmdocking.com/images/cards/b01/large/b01_Spe_Lig_010.jpg) you can discard the sentinel, and then bring it back without having to meet the high requirements. Playing fat creatures like this is risky though since they are almost instantly killed by powerful spells or fortunes, luckily Asalah also have access to [Elrath's Protection](http://tools.mmdocking.com/images/cards/s04/large/s04_Spe_Lig_060.jpg) and [Ice Armour](http://tools.mmdocking.com/images/cards/s04/large/s04_Spe_Wat_061.jpg) which makes them last that much longer.

**PS**

Asalah is also the only hero in the game that uses both Fire and Water spells, this gives her the ability to play both [Mass Rage](http://tools.mmdocking.com/images/cards/s03/large/s03_Spe_Fir_052.jpg) AND [Focused Mind](http://tools.mmdocking.com/images/cards/s03/large/s03_Spe_Wat_051.jpg), a very powerful combination that I use in my own Asalah Deck you can see [here](http://tools.mmdocking.com/decks/show/3989)."

dakboy,AskReddit,1390014623.0,"I'm certain there's a reputable independent shop in your area. Ask friends, neighbors, co-workers. If your city/town/college has a subreddit, ask for recommendations there.

Here's one way to check your mechanic's honesty. If you take the car in for one problem, and he says ""BTW, while I was in there, I noticed this other thing. Since we had to take everything apart for the original problem, it'll only cost you parts to fix this other thing while I'm in there"", he's on the level. OTOH, if he charges the full book rate for both jobs even though there's an overlap, he's screwing you.

For example, if you take the car in for a coolant flush &amp; fill, and he says ""hey, you've got some hoses about ready to break/leaky water pump"", there's overlap in those jobs - when you change hoses or the water pump, you'll have to do a coolant drain &amp; fill anyway (except *maybe* if it's the upper radiator hose). A bad shop will charge you for the full water pump job **and** the flush &amp; fill. A good shop will say ""well, we had to drain the coolant anyway to change the pump, so we'll charge you for the water pump job and only the cost of the coolant"".

Having a shop you know you can trust is a very good thing. It's even worth paying a couple extra bucks to have that peace of mind. I moved a little over a year ago and the *one* thing I miss about the town I left is that I had an awesome mechanic right there. I've found another close to my office, but I miss calling up my original guy and having him say ""which car is coming in this time?"" when all he's seen is the caller ID and all he's heard is my first name."

Therapy will uncover tough/ugly parts of ourselves and it will be in the presence of your SO but also another person. This is sometimes too much for some people. Remember the therapist is not always aware of what will be lying dormant with our clients. 

Some people talk about therapy and being one sided and I wonder if that is because clients come to therapy and expect pats on the back and are upset when the receive reflections that dont fit their impression of themselves. 

Find someone who does not come off as judgmental and you will be ok. 

Its tricky work.

jolene_jolene_jolene,TumblrInAction,1390014980.0,"Ok, from what I remember from reading Boddypants and listening to the audio book (I have a Tina Fey addiction and it's a problem), Tina is talking about very real things that happened to her and people around her in the business as they occurred in her life. 

There isn't a lot of theory here, it's, ""I was a good comedian and though that usually got me pretty far, here are some anecdotes that are baffling nonsense in that they regard my being a lady as a factor."" 

At one point, she talks about the fact that women were only allowed to be a certain percentage of any cast and how that was bullshit. Not because the women needed affirmative action, but because the funniest people are funny enough to make a scene funny (talking about Improv).

 Her whole argument wasn't that it was just 'unfair to women', but that the craft suffered for people not just seeing funny people and throwing them together to see what funny stuff comes out. 

She also calls people out for asking her if it's hard to be a woman boss, saying, ""No, and you wouldn't ask a dude, I'm a person who is a boss because I am excellent at being bossy and It's not hard it's my job that once again I am excellent at."" 

It's one thing for a Tumblrista to talk about Hollywood and media from behind a keyboard, but I think that it's another for someone like Tina to pull from her own life to show us that the very small and insular world of comedy writing was still a boys club when she got into it.

Tina excelled and did her best to change it by doing great work, promoting talent and teaching and learning from the great men she worked with, not through demanding brute force equality.

The circumstances under which we won were so crazy that you can't say that adding or subtracting any certain player would have helped us to win it just the same. 

For instance we had Bosingwa, who had been truly awful that season, starting the final because Ivanovic was suspended. And I think it's fair to say that Ivanovic is to Bosingwa what Cavani/Falcao is to Torres. We won the game with Bosingwa in. I don't think that one could say that we DEFINITELY would have won then if Ivanovic played instead of Bosingwa just because he is better. The way everything unfolds is unique to every game and to each player that is involved on the pitch and the addition or subtraction of one player changes the entire complexion of any given game, especially a run of games over a competition like the champions league.

TheDrunkenChud,AdviceAnimals,1390015176.0,"&gt;...twat ordered a medium rare burger and then sent it back because it wasn't done.

re-read that. medium rare is on the very low side of done. when you order a burger medium rare it appears very undercooked. most people are used to shitty line cooks who, when told to cook to med rare, end up cooking to medium. the problem is threefold. shitty customers who order a degree under what they want instead of what they want, a server who doesn't describe to them ""ok, medium rare, that's a warm red center"" and a line cook who cooks to proper temp, sends it out and the person bitches because their food is cooked exactly how they asked for it, but they don't know what the fuck they actually want because they're twats and order a degree under (or over in some cases, and those are the worst because of the food waste) what they want. so, while you want to sit there on your high horse and act like a douche, learn some reading comprehension there turbo. 

i remember when i was line cook once, a couple guys came in asking for 20oz porterhouses, rare. cooked a perfect rare with signature diamond grill marks and sent it out. came back saying it was too well done. wtf? i temped those before sending out. those fuckers were cold. so i cook two more about two minutes less than i cooked the ones prior. came back again, too well done. the server says, ""they keep saying they want it really really rare. if those last steaks were too well done, i don't know how much more rare you can go"". at that point, i understood they wanted their steaks blue. had they ordered blue the first time, they would have received them blue. it's fucking disgusting, but hey, it's your meal. so threw those fuckers on the grill for maybe a minute to get the grill marks in it and call it good. they loved it. sent back a $10 tip just for me. told her to tell them to avoid confusion in their future disgusting endeavors, to order their food steaks ""blue"". never had a problem with those guys after that. wasted about 80oz of porterhouse in the process, but hey, better than wasting that every time they came in because they didn't know how to order what they actually wanted.

tl;dr: customers don't know what they want."

1. The M5A97R20 has a 970 Chipset, which is more powerful and more apt to run more powerful processors, etc.

2. The 1st motherboard (M5A97R20) also has twice the memory capacity (both 4 slots, but 16GB vs. 32GB, useful if you plan for HEAVY video editing in the future, but for that I'd just switch over to Intel i7.

3. The 1st option offers the ability to Crossfire two AMD GPUs together (AMD GPUs only, neither motherboard supports SLI)

4. The 2nd option is microATX, it's physically smaller, built for smaller cases.

The motherboard choice does not necessarily affect PC performance, but the 970 chipset will prove to be a better choice due to higher TDP rating than the 760, allowing for higher consumption CPUs to be used in the future (8320)"

Both companies went with the least powerful machine they could get away with. Most likely to keep it cheap and not have to sell it at a loss. Now see the thing with games and computer graphics is that optimization plays a fairly small role. it can improve your performance by maybe 10% if you spend a lot of time on it. The thing that really makes games look better, as you'll see in this generation of consoles is the advancement of computer graphics and real-time rendering technologies.

That industry is moving at an incredibly rate and a Ph.D. student could write a paper about a theory they had and reduce memory usage across the board by 10-20%. But yeah, the current console generation can't ""burn through it"" because they are on pretty low-end hardware."

JtiksPies,StonerPhilosophy,1390015448.0,"Well for one thing, the elements in your body aren't just similar to those found in stars, they are made in stars.  Every single element in existence (except ones created in particle accelerators) was created in a star.  The Big Bang Theory is not the death of a star.  Before matter even existed, it was all energy (Matter and energy are the same thing in different forms as per E=mc^2 )  All this energy was pent up in a singular point and was pushed outward.  Some say black holes are the ""other end"" of these but that's a different theory.

Now here's the mind bender: that ""point"" consisted of the entire universe as it is now. The photons pushing outward didn't expand out in the nothingness, just the bounds of the universe expanded.  So the entire universe was there, it's not getting bigger or smaller, only the dimensions are getting bigger. 


To answer OP: Technically gravity has infinite range but it's so weak that across space it's not even measurable at the quantum level.  So Black Holes won't continue to gobble up everything in existence, they'll gobble up everything in its realistic range and eventually decay as /u/mv2112 mentioned."

&gt; ...when you remove the soul from music and transplant the body parts (chord changes, instrumentation, dress, lights, and everything but the soul‚Ä¶) and parade it around with some more ""positive"" lyrics posing as Christian music, then what you have is a musical zombie. It looks like a human.. It eats like a human‚Ä¶ It still walks and makes noise and resembles a human, but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a zombie. It has no soul. It just uses it‚Äôs human body for its own purposes.

These laws are written for the express purpose of incentivizing qualified people to help during an emergency, by protecting them legally. The situation you described is not only silly, but goes against the only reason these laws are written.

&gt;The details of good Samaritan laws/acts in various jurisdictions vary, including who is protected from liability and in what circumstances.[23] Not all jurisdictions provide protection to laypersons, in those cases only protecting trained personnel, such as doctors or nurses and perhaps also emergency services personnel such as trained police, fire and EMS workers.[24]

xthorgoldx,pics,1390016058.0,"As I see it, the future will rely on a few things, in terms of energy survivability:

1. Fusion. No beating around the bush on this; it's the only form of renewable, non-waste producing, non-climate dependent energy we know is possible.
2. Revolution in electronics efficiency. No matter how fast we build, we'll never be able to supply as much energy as the world demands - which is why we have to *lower* demand through more efficient electronics and power distribution systems.
3. Increased use of orbital power stations. One of the other long-term useful power sources is solar, the problem is they're *really* inefficient on Earth. In orbit, they work a *lot* better, work 24/7, and are less prone to failure. Possibly more expensive than even fusion, the future of solar power lies in orbital stations, not in terrestrial farms. Think Dyson Sphere."

Some of us take it more seriously, some are addicted to making new decks (me), while some have only one. But we're all friends, and no matter how frustrated someone might get because I milled their Vorinclex with my Lazav out, the next game or even next turn can always swing to someone else, and we all have fun. Don't think I could go to an LGS at this point, as I've enjoyed playing with my friends much more than the couple games I've dropped into at the store.

That's my personal opinion - to draw from a post a few weeks (month?) ago, play EDH with your friends, not Commander at an LGS.

dakru,AskMen,1390016221.0,"&gt; Can you give examples of this please?

The nearly endless messages to men about how they should ""respect women"":

[Example 1](http://i.imgur.com/CGhbEJG.jpg)

[Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/8OjVLLP.jpg)

[Example 3](http://i.imgur.com/EBQD3vE.jpg)

[Example 4](http://i.imgur.com/mwAgC13.jpg)

[Example 5](http://i.imgur.com/m0ey6d9.jpg)

Most fundamentally these almost never come along with a corresponding message to men about how they deserve respect from themselves, and certainly there's nothing telling men about how they deserve respect any sort of respect from women. The result is a gendered view of respect; women are inherently valuable and deserve respect automatically, while men have to earn it.

It's not hard to see how this results in men putting women on a pedestal. It's really sad to see men jump over each other to declare how much they ""respect women!"". What we need to teach them is to base their respect of someone on their character, actions, and achievements, not their gender.

**Perhaps even worse than that** is the common view in our society on the gender balance in relationships. When asked for marriage advice for men, Barack Obama replied [""just do whatever she tells you to""](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/repairing-relationships/201207/president-barack-obamas-marriage-advice). The trope that ""the woman's always right in the end"" is thrown around only half-jokingly, and it genuinely influences people's conception of relationships and male/female interactions in general:

&gt; There is a cultural paradigm that tells us that women own relationships. They set the rules, they define acceptable behavior, etc. My wife, despite being the coolest woman I've ever met, still had some learning to do about this. Specifically, she had a culturally ingrained expectation that, when we disagreed, there would be a point where I should stand down and let her have her way, or the last word, or whatever. She experienced some cognitive dissonance from being treated like a real equal, and not like a child who can stamp her feet and get her way, but she learned to appreciate it for what it is - genuine respect.‚Äù [source: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1nppef/how_do_one_sided_marriages_come_into_being_see/ccku68i]

Furthermore, there has never been a single case of someone pretending to be trans to go into the bathroom. It's not even like there are laws *now* stating that men can't enter the women's room and vice versa. This is not a thing that happens, stop trying to turn into one.

Then the daughter started going to community college in one of the poorest (now bankrupt) counties in America. She was walking through campus one sunny day when an Ivy league school arrived with glossy pamphlets picturing the most beautiful and most beckoning wrought iron gates opening to a brick road of opportunity. And within her an old dream was whispered alive again, another tall tale chanted incessantly all through her school years. It had to be destiny, that she had finally found her ticket in. Though we are a nation of equality and meritocracy and virtues, we still treat certain sectors of the workforce as if they belong to lower castes. In her perception, her life was very much at stake between the wide chasmed dichotomy of successful ivy league grad and fast food burger flipper. Many schools were cheaper, but none could even truly compare in her eyes. The recruiter assured her the school would help her find a way to pay. After all, why wouldn't a school so rich help the neediest of its students? Once she found out the whole full ride scholarship fantasy was a complete myth, she scrambled to find a cosigner for basically a mortgage on an education of course to no avail.

But, of course, this is other Universes, which in a sense are canonical as we do see these Universes, and how they may interact with the more commonly used ones (616, Ultimate, etc), but at the same time disregarded because they serve as a medium for Marvel to do stuff they otherwise can't retcon in 616."
Sigh_No_More,wow,1390016924.0,"Mounts come from all kinds of places. Some you buy from vendors in the game, some drop in various dungeons and raids, and some you can buy for real money. You have to be level 20 to learn the riding skill and get ground mounts (every race has its own mount, and when you hit 20, you should get a quest to go learn the riding skill, and you can buy mounts from a vendor in that area), and you have to be level 60 to get flying mounts.

Sorry if you knew some of that already. Not sure how new to the game you are! Also, if you see someone in the game with a mount you like, you can click on them and hover over the little icons under their name. One of them will tell you which mount it is, and then if you're really curious, you can look it up online to see where they got it from! I personally like [wowhead](http://www.wowhead.com/) for looking things up, but there are several good sites. "

miked4o7,politics,1390016944.0,"Why wouldn't you expect it to be a part of it?  I'm an atheist, but if I try and put myself in the shoes of somebody that *truly* believes the things that evangelicals do, I can see that as long as they hold those beliefs, it's absolutely and completely unrealistic to expect them to not involve themselves in politics on behalf of those beliefs.

If you *really really* believed, for example, that homosexuality is an abomination in the eyes of God.  And you saw that teenagers in this country that were discovering they were homosexual were embracing that instead of trying to change from that 'sin', you would see it as the one of the greatest possible dangers that children in this country face.  The *worst* physical abuse you could see your neighbor inflicting on their son would not be even close to as awful as a neighbor accepting their child's homosexuality.  Inserting their religion in politics at every possible juncture is not only justified from that perspective... it would be unthinkable to *not* try and affect politics.


The problem, of course, is that their actual beliefs are plainly stupid and absolutely unfounded.  But because we've build up this cultural taboo around criticizing peoples religious beliefs (notice we don't do this with any other kind of belief), we have to pretend that their beliefs should be respected on some level.  They shouldn't be.  Their beliefs should be dissected and torn apart at every reasonable opportunity.  The social ramifications of saying you believe in the barbaric God of Abraham *should* be along the same line as the ramifications for saying that you think a group of clandestine lizard people run the world via cabals... or that Elvis help you make your daily decisions."

1) Back ground: 

My brother died, right in front of me, when I was in 5th grade, I was out of school for about a week. The day I came back I had a band lesson. Lesson was almost done. I was all packed up and listening to what she was telling me to practice with half an ear. This is the  conversation that followed.

""I'm sorry for your loss."" Her

""Thank you."" Mechanical response by this point. 

""So, was Matt your real brother?""

""What do you mean? Of course he was my real brother."" Getting irked at this point.

""Oh, so you guys had the same parents then? Same blood?"" She asks

""Nooo...."" 

Cuts me off to say, ""Oh, then he wasn't your *real* brother. That's not so bad then.""

I just stared for about a minute, instantly enraged. So pissed I can't even say anything. I just stand up, walk out and skip returning to my classroom and walk straight to the office and tell the principal what just happened. Hysteria started as I entered the office, so it took about a half hour before I was able to actually explain what happened.

I finished out the Easter concert and quit band right after. 


2) Same year, in the beginning. My teacher stated that she  didn't want to teach someone with ""disabilities"".  All I had was ADHD...so 5th grade was not a good year.

I would say to improve it, try and cut out some of the little ""spaces"" between the notes, to help the licks flow better. A couple of your bends are a little flat as well, try ""stacking"" your spare fingers behind the finger that is doing the bend and use them to help push the string up, it should make the bends easier to hit. Try varying how hard you pick the strings for some dynamic (volume) variation.

You should try and learn to alternate your pick strokes, do down up down up down up etc. this will probably help relieve some tension in your right hand. At the moment your picking looks slightly awkward and a little bit forced, almost like you are picking too hard.

There's a reason why we do it. However if you do it wrong, you're a total bitch. I'll explain:


Women do this because they feel like they are being ignored, unappreciated, and that their feelings don't matter to their boyfriend/husband. If you go straight to pulling the ""I don't want to be together anymore"" method, that is wrong. It's only supposed to be a last resort. 

By threatening to break up, we want to see how you react to that statement. We're testing you. We might even say something like ""something needs to change or I'm going to leave."" We watch facial expressions, body language, and attitude. 

After all methods fail, aka talking, expressing our feelings directly, giving the guy ""some space"", and they're still not giving a fuck. Sometimes you might get desperate. 

Source? I am the wife to an emotional brick wall. The talking method only gets me this far, ""I don't want to talk about it."" and ""I'm not doing this right now."" ... The last resort method will even get me ""I don't care. Do whatever you want."" So this has happened to me a few times.

NativityCrimeScene,IAmA,1390017341.0,"I don't really keep track of percentages, but the average tip for the average taxi fare (around $10-$15 fare) is about a $3 tip. I consider $3-$5 to be the range of good tips that make me smile and tell the customer I really appreciate it. 

I wouldn't be upset by $2 tips either, but $1 is disappointing and less than $1 I wouldn't even consider to be a tip. Anything over $5 was awesome and I got tips of more than $5 almost every night.

With tips it kind of depends on the situation too. If I'm giving your drunk ass a ride home from the bars at 2am when the bars close, I'm expecting a good tip, but if it's the end of my shift and I'm giving you a ride to your job at McDonalds at 6am, I wouldn't be as upset by a $1 or $2 tip as long as you're nice to me.

There were some streets or neighborhoods I didn't know as well as others, but if I was giving someone a ride home or to their friends house and I didn't know where it was they would usually be able to give me directions. If not, I would look it up on my smart phone before I started to drive.

Your social skills can be improved in the same way as most other skills: thorough practice. Practice talking to people, practice carrying a conversation, practice keeping your cool.

&gt; Similarly, if I told you, be more ambitious, would that information help you?

If it breaks the overwhelming focus on niceness, then yes it would be quite helpful to a guy.

&gt; As to niceness, there's a car ad showing in Australia at the moment which ends with the happy female car buyer showing off her husband, who is very handsome, brings her a cup of coffee and shows her the puppy he rescued on the way. Women do like niceness in men.

I didn't say it wasn't a positive. My arguments are that it's far from the most important thing in a man's desirability as a partner (even if people portray it that way), and that there aren't that many men who are doing poorly with women because they aren't nice enough. However on the other hand there are a lot of men who do poorly with women not because they're nice but because they focus on niceness to the detriment of other traits."

I'm a big feminist, and all of that, but sometimes I wonder why more people don't agree that abortion isn't always a ""neutral act"" and is just usually the more preferable of the many shitty options. 

I *don't* think it is a crazy question to ask relating abortion to veganism.  Most of us admit that getting an abortion isn't a carefree act and that it can be very trying for the person going through it, but then any objection is met with: lump of cells! parasite! tumor!  

I wish no one needed abortions.  And yes, I have gotten irritated with friends who have gotten 1 or more through being completely irresponsible (though I did not express it and was totally supportive, of course).  At 24 I knew about the Morning After Pill.  I knew sex without birth control gets you pregnant since I-don't-know-when.  So I can kind of see the point of saying if you are someone in X situation, you should know better.  (Men and women) 

Because I gave no stats, I just looked it up:  
Reasons for abortion (what the poster was referring to probably)
38% Have completed my childbearing
32% Not ready for another child

So, we don't know *what* happened in these cases but most of the couples should know about prevention, etc.

Only 2% of late-term abortions are done because of problems with the fetus.  (Maternal health wasn't listed and was included in 11% Other)  

Rape or incest was 1%

For all abortions: just 6% is due to fetal health (this jumps to 13% in a later study and 12% for maternal health in a later study)  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_termination_of_pregnancy
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States#Reasons_for_abortions

Yes, I realize there are a lot of problems concerning reproductive health in this country (I used to teach high school in an extremely poor neighborhood.) and that is why I was focussing on my anecdotals: situations in which everybody knew better and could have been resolved with a morning after if they had second thoughts.

I will always be for legal abortion, as how you said the alternatives are too horrible (forcing women to give birth, etc.) but I still think we should talk about it critically/academically.  And not only as an issue where all the blame lies on women.  

Sorry, I did not want to make you the end of some abortion rant, I usually stay out of these discussions all together.  

ANYWAY.  Yes, I think modern, legal abortion is a great development.  But, just as in veganism, I am always interested in looking at the issue fully. "

blahtender,buildapc,1390017502.0,"There are a lot of links on the sidebar that you can browse through and get a pretty good idea, but I'll break it down in TL;DR for you.

Needed:

CPU - The main processor, or ""brain."" It handles the computations necessary for the computer to operate. Intel core i-series and AMD A-series have integrated GPUs that eliminate the need for dedicated video cards.

Motherboard - The main infrastructure supporting the CPU and other parts. You could call it the nervous system if you want a comparison. It connects all of the parts to work as one computer. It also contains your basic audio hardware/software and the basic software necessary for ease of use when you need to configure hardware and install an OS.

PSU - The heart, if you will. It supplies power to all of the parts of your computer. They're graded on efficiency using the 80+ rating system. The higher the rating, the more efficient the PSU, and the lower your power bill will be. 

RAM - This is your short term memory. When you're writing a paper, and you haven't saved the work yet, this is where it is stored. 

HDD/SSD - Storage, or long-term memory. This information will sit, unchanged, until you change it, even after the computer reboots.

Case - The exoskeleton. It keeps your PC's parts safe from the elements and allows you to turn the computer on without having to use a screwdriver to bridge pins on the motherboard. Also, provides stable mounting points for your components.

Not needed, but you'll probably want them:

Video card - Your computers graphical muscle. Houses a dedicated GPU and GDDR RAM to render higher quality visuals by using hundreds or thousands of smaller, more basic cores in order to handle the task of calculating what color thousands upon thousands of individual pixels should change to and when. 

CPU Cooler - your CPU will come with a stock fan, unless you order an OEM replacement CPU. The stock fan will pretty much always be good enough to use as long as you aren't overclocking.

Extra Case fans - More air movement = cooler parts = higher efficiency."

I'd need 25*25=625k in investments to have an annual return of 25k?
But making 625k in investments while adding $20k a year would take 31 years, ie. retiring at age 56. Is that still considered as retiring early?

askgeeves,gallifrey,1390018397.0,"I've found that since I watched the classic series watching the week to week episodes didn't feel as good for me. I still get excited to watch a new episode every week but can't rewatch any but a select few of 11s episodes.  (Not the same for 9 and 10 though, I can rewatch nearly all of theirs).

Maybe because my memory of the Classic series is all ""city of death"", ""tomb of the cybermen"", ""caves of the androzani"", ""the curse of frenric"", etc. so basically my memory holds a selection of the highlights of over 25 years of the show. And the classic series more than the new series has become more of a paradigm of what Doctor Who is for me. Cheesy, exciting, doesn't take itself all too seriously, crazy costumes, shitty special effects and all which I feel has been ever so slightly lost with the Americanisation of the show in terms of the drama and action. 

Maybe, also, my expectations for new episodes have become too high (and the constant week-to-week over-hyping by the DW social media team doesn't help this) but episodes often feel very disappointing as soon as the credits are rolling. I do still enjoy actually while I'm watching the episodes though. 

In a way the highlight of the last wee while of the DW universe has been The Five(ish) Doctors. Maybe it was the lack of trailers/expectations or the return to not taking itself seriously at all but even though it wasn't even a doctor who universe story I felt like it embodied more of what the show actually is to me.

However, I do like the aspect of watching week-to-week episodes for the fan-theories and discussions here. I find that really enhances my experience of the show more than binge watching would. "

If you're projected (much more common in your size range), it's unlikely they'll fit right.  Try the Maddie on backwards, to test the band, as too small cups will make it feel tight quickly.  

Have you seen the shape guide?  That's probably what you need to figure out next.

Also, remember that FF is a thing.  A 32G is the same volume as 34FF, so if the band on 32G is too tight even with the cups on the back, and the quadboob in Maddie isn't too extreme, try 34FF next.  "

Would you be willing to be friends with her even if she rejects you? That's cool too but you cannot get bitchy and mad at her for not being romantically interested in you. Do not be her friend if you think it will help you be her boyfriend. It probably won't and you will be heart broken and bitter.

Also, ALL attraction has an expiration date. Don't let her attraction for you expire, you need to ask her out ASAP.

I've hit plateaus and I've only been working out for 8 months. It's part of getting better. I plateaued at a 405 deadlift for about 3 weeks before I switched to sumo and hit a 405 after 2 sessions. I hit a 455 2 weeks later and I put up 500 3 weeks after that.

I plateaued my squats with LP after a giant cut at 275x5/315x1. Switched to volume for 3 weeks without ever going above 225 and then started doing triples and managed a 385x1 6 weeks after 315x1. In the 3 weeks since then I switched to Smolov and put up a 405x1 immediately after a 10x3x330.

I recently bought a couple of pairs of Levi 510s (in the picture below the Olive Chinos). The 510s feel slightly more fitted than the chinos, especially below the knee, although the chinos do still feel quite slim with a bit of room (which is good). Haven't tried on 511s so can't compare the two, but I'd presume they'd be similar.

The 510s on the left (lighter blue, picture 3) are a size 28 waist. This is a lot tighter on me than the chinos, especially around the waist, and the waist would be similar to the 29 (darker blue, pictures 4-6) while a little bit roomier below the knee.

What you are trying to say is that adjusting saddle position changes the pitch of the harmonic... which (for sake of argument 12th fret) is a perfect octave above the open string. Do yourself a favour, take your guitar, screw the saddle all the way out as close to the bridge pickup as possible, RETUNE to correct pitch, pick harmonic at 12th fret. It will be a perfect octave above your open. Now, screw the saddle all the way in the other direction. RETUNE the string to its correct pitch, and sound the harmonic. It will be the same perfect octave, exact same pitch.

Your talking about Bass and Ukelele literally has no relevance here whatsoever, you are only defeating your own argument. Bass has a different scale from guitar, yet a harmonic at the 12th fret on a bass, is is STILL a perfect octave. I'm not sure what you are even trying to prove at all... 

Further to using harmonics to adjust your intonation, the actual intonation adjustment is performed so that FRETTED notes sound at the correct pitch. It has NOTHING to do with the pitch of the harmonics at all.

Adjusting saddles =/= different harmonic pitches. The only possible way that what you are saying makes any sense is if you are adjusting the saddle while sounding the harmonic, thus changing the pitch of the string... but then the string will be tuned again to its correct pitch anyway, thus the harmonic will still be the same pitch when the guitar is tuned up and intonated... so either you are a troll, or you really have NO idea what you are even talking about."

sitaroundandglare,mylittlepony,1390019162.0,"#1 Poor Spike
Thank you for pointing out my error about the musical.  I can't believe I missed that he was there.

#2 The Generosity Song

&gt; I think you may be mistaking generosity for altruism. This show has never suggested that Rarity would not expect something in return for her generosity.  

I really just have an issue with singing about how you should ‚Äújust be nice without making a fuss‚Äù and then making a giant fuss about how you're so nice.

#3 The Cabs

&gt; It was Rainbow Dash and Twilight who were trying to persuade their way ahead of the line. 

I suppose you're right.  I confused my dislike with the fact that the show obviously cast them as heartless New Yorkers when they were totally in the right.

#4 Suri Treats Coco EXACTLY how Rarity (&amp; Twilight) treat(s) Spike, but louder

&gt; Suri demands favours from someone who doesn't really want to be there, while Spike offers favours, and Rarity takes advantage of that.

Suri isn't demanding favors.  She's telling her employee what to do.  Getting paid to do something makes it not a favor.  I agree that she's a total asshole about it, but Coco is her employee, and is paid to do as is told.  Spike sometimes offers favors, and I have no issue with that.  But Rarity making a cute face and saying ""oh, be a dear"" to get Spike to carry another loud of her crap is still manipulative and unkind.

#5 That Fucking Outburst

&gt; but was she doing anything you wouldn't do in your worst moments? 

Yes, she was.  She went way beyond being snappy &amp; rude &amp; tired &amp; stressed.  She clearly crossed the line into emotional manipulation, accusing her friends of not caring about her.  Especially dangling the tickets over their heads: ‚Äú¬†I go out of my way to get you tickets for a show, and this is how you repay me?‚Äù.  You do not get to use getting people tickets to an event as argument leverage when you have no intention of letting them go to said event.  Her friends traveled with her to support her, spent all night slaving over machines for her, and suddenly ‚ÄúI GOT YOU TICKETS HOW DARE YOU MENTION USING THEM‚Äù.  No.  No no no.

&gt; It may have been wrong of her, but when she realized what she done, she did whatever she could to make amends.

I still contend that she never would have done anything to make amends if her friends had showed up like she intended.  She was perfectly pleased with herself when she woke up &amp; left.  She was overjoyed when people were cheering her work on.  If her friends had been in the audience, I doubt she would have ever realized her error.  She's very self-centered.

&gt; You (and the episode itself) fails to mention that Rarity isn't the only one to blame here. The rest of them are only there because of Rarity, and the competition she was in. The musical wasn't why they were there. They priorities were on the musical, not the fashion show.
Their priorities weren't the musical.  All they did was mention ‚Äúwe're supposed to be at the musical by then‚Äù when they'd obviously been slaving for *hours* trying to help Rarity.  Nothing was said between ‚Äúwe're supposed to be at Hinny of the Hills by then...‚Äù and her screaming at everyone.  They already looked like they were going to drop it before she started accusing them of enjoying her misery.

How is it blameful to politely mention ‚Äúoh, we actually had plans then, she who promised to feed us and then didn't‚Äù?

#6 She Insulted the Doorman

&gt; I'm going to chalk this down to her state of mind. Rarity is feeling that her friends have abandoned her because of the way she treated them. Proper tipping etiquette isn't going to be foremost on her mind in a situation like that.

Fair enough.  It still goes to show that she really only thinks about herself.  I cannot remember a single instance in the show where she was kind because it was the right thing to do, rather than being kind because it would make her look good.  She cares about ""being generous"", not about actually helping people, empathizing with them, or thinking about what maybe they really want.

#7 She Fucked Over The Hinny of the Hills Team

&gt; Rarity saw her work. She saw the gowns she made for the show.

By that logic, Rainbow Dash would have been a perfectly reasonable replacement.   After all, she &amp; the other ponies sewed together all of Rarity's designs.  Being a good seamstress (sewing patterns together beautifully) is different from being a good designer (making beautiful patterns)

&gt; We really didn't see the entire exchange between Coco, Rarity, and the producer of the musical. Most likely she staked her reputation on Coco's abilities.

But what matters here is that she made a promise to Coco without even consulting the person who'd be Coco's employer.

sturdyliver,nintendo,1390019447.0,"* Get past this Not Invented Here attitude and accept that good ideas sometimes come from outside Nintendo. Not only that, sometimes those ideas even become vital to future success.
* If you're going to go off the beaten path, have a plan. Of the 8 disc-based games I own for Wii U, only 2 (Nintendo Land and Wonderful 101) use the touch screen in a unique way that could not be easily duplicated on a standard game pad. Just because a technology is novel and interesting doesn't mean that developers will instantly unlock its potential, especially if Nintendo themselves don't provide a good example. Instead it just deters developers from bringing their cross-platform games to Wii U.
* Acknowledge that there is a world outside of Japan and that it is where most of their sales come from. You can tell that NOA execs know that people hate the account system, eShop design, etc. They probably tell the folks in Japan that at every opportunity, yet Nintendo doesn't seem to care what anybody outside of Japan thinks."

Because the 12th fret is equidistant from bridge and nut (theoretically) so that it sounds a perfect octave above the open string. Thus the corresponding harmonic at that fret results in a harmonic of the same pitch as the fretted note (assuming correct intonation has been set). 

The relation of string length to pitch in terms of harmonics has absolutely nothing to do with saddle position or intonation. A 12th fret harmonic on a string tuned to E will *always* be a perfect octave above the open string, regardless of any changes to saddle position. You are really attempting to argue otherwise?"

Qinella,cringepics,1390019970.0,"Haha, yeah I get the /r/thathappened reference, but really my sociology courses in college were filled with this kind of thing. Once in my senior seminar, the prof handed each row of students a paper with a name or label on it. Each row had a different label, like man, woman, laborer, etc. We were asked to anonymously write down attributes that applied to that label. Then the prof would collect them all and read the responses to illustrate stereotypes about a label.

Well, the label I got was ""man."" So I wrote things like defends loved ones, provides for family, works hard. It was supposed to all be anonymous, but when the professor read out my card about ""what a man should be,"" people were so outraged that they started demanding to know who wrote it. The professor tried to say it was meant to be anonymous, but I raised my hand and said I'd written it and that just because those things applied to a stereotype of men didn't mean women couldn't also embody those concepts. Man, people were ready to crucify me by the end of that class. Just for saying that the typical idea of a man is someone who provides for his family, protects loved ones, etc. 

I know it sounds wacky. I was a sociology major and so was always involved in scenarios where a white hetero male was essentially considered the enemy. It was weird. And I learned a ton. Wouldn't trade it for anything."

If you do it again, they tow the car, you pay the fine again, but this time doubled and you can't drive for 2 years.

InfamousKelso,AskWomen,1390020140.0,"Firstly, just for background clarification. I'm 25 and my boyfriend is 23 with a 5 year old son from his first (as in first ever) relationship.

I never thought I could date men who has a child(ren) because I was never a person who wanted kids nor felt any need to have them. I'm too young! I have a lot of life I want to live! Also the fact that I'm a child of a nasty divorce and my mom had me very young (16) so signs pointed to ""no"" for me for a very long time. 

When I met my boyfriend, he didn't hide the fact that he had a child with a less than stable chick he had accidentally impregnated in high school. I was at first thrown off by this but after watching how he interacted and parented his son and how he took full responsibility when he really didn't have to - if only for the simple fact that this kid wasn't going to live in a highly unstable environment- was tugging at my ol' heartstrings. Also, I had just left a 3 year relationship with a fiancee who was a total man-child in his own right, and I had done a lot of difficult life experiences that I was just plain jaded of what I had going on. I felt like I had to grow up and settle down a bit. It all kinda clicked -both in my head and in my heart- that I could actually try this. 

So we did, we lived separately for a year before making the jump to move in together (a process we made sure the kid was comfortable with as well, we would never pressure him with our relationship if he wasn't absolutely on board with it either. Hence why we waited a year.) At this point, he had just turned 4 and was already potty trained, could feed himself, clothe himself etc. Basically, all the hard, gross baby stuff was over with. I'm so grateful for this. Now I get to be a positive female role model (something he really doesn't have with his mother) and he gets to live in a positive, warm, loving household with his own room and clean everything and no hitting or fighting or yelling from angry young parents who really don't know what they're doing. 

Another rewarding thing is that I get to *teach* him things! How to read, do math, create awesome shit from legos, skateboard, Power Rangers, Transformers....It's so awesome to watch the proverbial wheels turn in his head while he tries to figure something out. I'm proud of him. I'm proud of us too. I don't recommend this to everyone, being a second mom is hard, Incredibly hard. Especially when you have to share a child whose mother is less than spectacular. If it was mom's turn to pick him up from school and she just plain forgot (it's happened before) and they can't reach dad because he's in a meeting, I get to pick up her pieces and clean up her messes. I don't mind doing this because I love him like he were my own kid. And you really have to be prepared for that, most ladies/gentlemen go into it like ""this will be fun!"" but it isn't. It's fucking *work* but truly, incredibly rewarding work.

Now, if you asked me if I were to do it again. I'd probably say ""no"". Because there's simply nobody like this kid and there's nobody like his father. Every child will be different as will every dad and every parenting style. I just took a wild leap and got lucky with this one. I highly doubt I will be as lucky the next time. But, then again, those little shits really do grow on you after a while. 

**tl;dr** - Dating single father is a ""yes"" for me, ""Maybe/No"" if asked to do it again. I got lucky.

pouzou,changemyview,1390020172.0,"Op, I argue that if you do not vaccinate yourself and your children, that you are being selfish to the community as a whole in addition to taking on additional risk for yourself and your children.

Herd immunity is something that you are currently taking advantage of and is very likely why you haven't caught anything serious like measles or whooping cough.  However, some immunocompromised people and infants and small children rely on herd immunity as their only protection against these same dangerous diseases.  And the more people added to the unvaccinated, the worse herd immunity becomes.  Plenty of people in this thread have outlined the dangers that you present to yourself and your possible children, but you also need to know that you present a danger to the community.  You or your children could kill someone via an exposure and in the age where vaccinations are low risk and easily available, I would place their blood on your hands.  It may not be murder, but you would be responsible in my book."

I can sorta relate on the mental problems.  Bipolar II makes it tough sometimes, and the hormones from the implant have given me some mood swings as time has gone on, so that's been an interesting mix.  I'm not on meds, but behavioral therapy and counselling is helping out, and in some ways maybe even the sex drive is helping.  Lets me connect to the person I depend on the most, especially when I'm feeling really rough, helps me regain a sense of stability and control (not in a bad way, but like ""*I'M* making this happen.""), and all the endorphins and stuff like that.  I dunno.  Just the very welcome and long-awaited freedom I feel from the implant has helped my mental state so much.  I wish it could be better for you.

Side note to the photog who shot it(and sorry if this is off topic of the editing)- use a tripod ALL THE TIME! To me, it looks incredibly tacky when it goes from shaky cam to a stable shot(You did a good job covering it up it seems).

It wasn't psychological, as I have no moral issue with birth control (nor abortion, for that matter), and both times, it was my call.

EnergyCritic,AskFeminists,1390020720.0,"&gt;""Patriarchy"" in the feminist sense is a social theory that is non empirically evident, not a phenomenon.

Actually, it's rather empirically evident. It is also a phenomenon. Very much so in the feminist sense.

&gt;the fact that human relations between the two genders in terms of romantic/sexual relations have been fairly much the same throughout all known human history and on fairly much every continent (male breadwinner/female caregiver) is significant to me in the fact that these roles were not entirely created by men but a mutual social contract between the sexes.

You have made a fallacious assumption from history. You have been told that the relationships between men and women have always been monogamous and heterosexual and you are projecting your own considerations of the matter as evidence of there being some sort of justification for the subjugation of women. Not useful or evident of such.

&gt;Society is changing over the past hundred years, and that is only natural.

Society has always been changing, but it is cynical to believe there was no such thing as polyamory, divorce, women's rights, homosexuality, trans-sexuality, or even controversy over the concept of sex more than 100 years ago. To assume that sexuality has only ever been a ""mutual social contract between the sexes"", one that establishes women as weaker than men, is naive.

&gt;However, I feel that blaming a theoretical patriarchy for the world's problems instead of recognizing the fact that humanity as a whole (not just men) have benefited and created our history is folly.

Your lack of understanding of patriarchy is the *real* folly here.

&gt;Tl;Dr Kyriarchy is a far superior theory to fight against, 

&gt;patriarchy makes no sense sociological when men and women played equal parts in defining humanity up till now.

Hardly so. When one group is oppressed, it easier for them to submit to their oppressors than to fight back. Read [Pedagogy of the Oppressed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed), for a decent examining of this. Additionally, asserting that there is indeed Kyriarchy would affirm the existence of patriarchy, as patriarchy is described as a system of oppression *within* Kyriarchy."

rising_son,Guitar,1390020735.0,"OK. Actually read what I am writing this time.

""Explain how the 12th fret is always equidistant from the nut and saddle even if I alter the position of the saddle. "" - I didn't say that it was. I said the position that the octave harmonic sounds at is always the same distance from the BRIDGE as it is from the NUT. Please actually read into what I said, instead of jumping to conclusions.

""Also, explain to me how the intonation doesn't alter the pitch of the harmonic but alters the pitch of fretted notes. "" This is what intonation does, it affects the pitch of fretted notes, not harmonics. Grab your guitar right now, and adjust your high E saddle all the way to the edge towards the neck as far as it can go, retune the string up to E, and play your 12th fret harmonic. It will be a perfect E. Now adjust the saddle all the way in as far as it can go. Retune your string down to E again, and play the harmonic. It will be the same both times. I can say this with 100% certainty. If you can make a video of you getting different pitch harmonics after RETUNING the string to the correct pitch I will PayPal you $1000. That's how sure I am.

Yes, adjusting the saddle changes the harmonic WHILE IT IS RINGING, but this is because adjusting the saddle increases and decreases the string tension, requiring you to RETUNE the string to the correct pitch. Get your chromatic tuner back out, loosen the saddle, and sound the high string. It has probably fallen close to a D# in pitch. Now pick your octave harmonic at the 12th fret.

Tell me what note the harmonic is... yeah. We are done here."

By here's the thing. I started out thinking ""one half marathon, just for shits and giggles."" turns out I loved it. But that love also pushed me to try and up my mileage and force the dropping of my time too quickly. In one year, I went from 11min mile to a 9:45.

Result? Continuous string of injuries that forced me to take a full year off and nearly 10lb gain (although there were other things that contributed to that weight gain).

I started running again last June. I've only just recently got my weekly mileage right around 20 miles again. If I managed an average of sub 11/mile.... I take it as a win.

The # of days per week I'm under 11min is increasing. Most days I'm actually around a 10:30 now. But until every run feels GOOD all the time at 10:30, I'm not gonna push it again.

So learn from me. Don't take on too much too quick. Celebrate small victories and know that they build to something bigger and greater.

Life-in-Death,AskMen,1390021117.0,"Arrgh, thank you!!  I dated a man for a year and a half.  He had two children 8 and 10.  He insisted that I meet them right away.  I fought it as long as I could.  I knew from the beginning that it wasn't going to be a ""forever"" relationship and I just didn't want to do that to the kids.  

I made sure the first time I met them it was on neutral turf (he wanted to pick them up and bring them to his apt where I would be waiting!) and I just tried to be as cool to them as I humanly could.  I refused all sleepovers when they were there, etc.  (We did go on one vacation together and I insisted on ""girls bed and boys bed"").

Anyway, most of our arguments were around me tell him how not to fuck up his kids.  He was a great dad who loved them like crazy, but I came from a divorced home and he didn't.  He had no idea what they were going through.  (Their mom got engaged and moved in with a man with 5 kids within the first year).

Well, we finally broke up and I never saw the kids again.  I really cared about them and just *liked* them.  I never even got to say goodbye."

skoobie93,explainlikeimfive,1390021163.0,"Also not a psychologist or sociologist, but I'll bet there's a component of learned ingroup identification.  

I wonder if they've done longitudinal studies where they follow gay men who grow up in small towns in flyover country, then move to a big city on one of the coasts once they reach the age of emancipation.  My guess is you'd see many of them start to act ""more gay"" after they get to a place where there's a large out gay community and join it.

Even in places like San Francisco, gay people are still a small fraction of the total population.  Obviously it would be useful to have some behavioral cues that let other people around you know that you're a member of the group.  And for equally obvious reasons, you may not have wanted to give off those same cues back in your small midwest hometown ."

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1390021266.0,"Well the fact that I'm not for ""meritocracy"" is because it comes off to me as a political system where elites elect elites. The very question of who is an ""expert"" becomes highly political, and without proper checks and balances from the people, can become highly corrupt, as the word ""expert"" begins to mean ""stooge who plays ball with the corrupt officials in charge"". Be a REAL expert, and become excluded because your views aren't state sanctioned.

That being said, a true meritocracy is a recipe for disaster. 

As for democracy, I would HOPE the people elect real experts, and I would HOPE they are educated. I recognize they often are not, but ultimately, I'd rather have a government by the people over a so called meritocracy, even if we get less intelligent people in office, because without the people, i dont care what system you got, it can become corrupt too easily."

Anyways, as you said Ocarina is a much lighter game as far as the story goes, important but not as dark as majora's mask, the dungeons on ocarina are to my opinion the best, they have great designs and they are fun, tedious enough but not impossible, long enough not to be boring.

arichi,personalfinance,1390021535.0,"First, what fraction of your current wealth is this?  Do you have other investments (401(k), IRA(s), etc)?

Second, is this in a tax-advantaged account (such as an inherited IRA), or in general taxable?

If you're 30 now and you intend to use this when you retire, the ERs are a _big_ thing to worry about -- that &gt;1% ER each (versus a less expensive fund, covering the same asset class) is going to be a _huge_ drag on returns.    

If they're in a tax-advantaged account, have it transferred to Vanguard (initiate this through Vanguard;  alternately, use your preferred reasonable fund provider, such as Fidelity or Schwab), sell (or transfer as cash within the account), and then invest in reasonable funds with the proceeds, according to your desired asset allocation.

If it's in taxable, it's a bit trickier.   Since they've been sitting for 10 years (stepped-up basis generally happens at time of death;  check with an accountant in case I'm wrong), they've likely incurred some capital gains.    If you sell - in order to buy reasonable funds, not to blow on whatever - you'll have to pay some capital gains taxes. 

_If it's in taxable, at the very least, stop re-investing the distributions -- have them sent to your bank account_.  Use them to help build your emergency fund... when that's funded, keep the distributions going to your bank account.  If you are going to re-invest them, do so manually -- into better funds, not through this guy.

As an added bonus, after a year, there are no new purchases of these things, so when you do sell, you'll know for a fact that it's a long-term capital gain (much lower tax rate).

&gt; Any tips on what I should tell the advisor when he calls? 

Tell him that you want (see my advice above).  _Do so only if you want to do that, of course_... and only if you understand the above.  _Never, in investing, do something you don't understand._

&gt; Any questions I should ask him (or the executor)? 

If you don't know, yes:  the tax status of the account these are in.  Is there any AUM (assets under management) fee going forward, or just the ERs?  What's the charge for the advice from the financial advisor?  Does he have a legal, fiduciary duty to you (and if so, can you get it in writing)?

&gt; I'm worried about the high ER, should I talk him into changing things around so it's invested in something else?

""Talk him into""?  No.  He works for you.  If you want to sell some things and put them into better investments, you tell him to do so and he does it.  Or better yet, he sells the investment, sends you the money, and _you_ buy the better investment with it -- so you don't pay AUM (etc) with it."

I've never had OS problems. ME worked fine for me, the pc doing entertainment center duty is Vista, no complaints.

Windows 8 has been fine. I too do not like doing everything ""in the cloud,"" given the current state of the NSA keeping records of every electronic thing every citizen does, so I've opted out of all that.

I don't like that MS is pushing being ""connected"" so hard. IMO, all the tech companies are partners with the gov't in today's data collection. No, I don't want you to have a record of everything I do on every computer I own.

Beyond that, 8.1 has been a pile of shit on my new laptop. The wireless didn't work for shit after the update, and following google's advice did nothing, so I rolled it back and turned off automatic updates. First time I've ever had a real issue.

Re. 8 and the touch-screen, I don't use it. I do not need a touch screen on my laptop or desktop, and both are set to use the plain ol' desktop. The only touch screen I use is my Android phone. So in that regard, MS screwed the pooch with 8."

I get pissed when I hear people say ""they'll spit in it"" or ""they'll drop it in the mop bucket water"" no we won't. Being mature adults aside I'm certain we have all been sick from food poisoning and really don't wish that upon anyone else let alone want to give it to someone."

I'm glad I remembered correctly about the SIM cards. It's been a while since I had gone phone shopping, back when Android phones were first coming out haha!

As for the Walmart service, I had actually bought a phone from them a few years ago (maybe 2 or 3) and the service wasn't terrible. The internet connection was not all the great, but then again I had a phone with access to 3G not the new fancy 4G. I received texts and calls fine, no lost or dropped calls. I didn't have much trouble getting signal on my phone either. I'm not sure if it's changed or anything.

gualdhar,AdviceAnimals,1390021866.0,"""Meat protein"" is a misnomer. Protein is made of amino acids, and most are made by an animal's body (including humans). As long as you're getting all of the amino acids your body can't produce naturally, and the vitamins and minerals too, the source doesn't really matter.

Dogs need all the amino acids humans do, plus [Arginine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine), which can be found in foods like wheat, buckwheat, oatmeal, and peanuts.

Cats are different because they also need [Taurine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurine), which cannot easily be found in vegan foods.

So no, a dog does not *require* meat in it's diet, though it's certainly less work to have a healthy diet if the dog eats meat, since it gets every essential amino acid in one source. With work, a dog food or dietary regimen can be crafted that doesn't include meat."

Megawatts19,Saints,1390022248.0,"Let me start this comment with: I love Jimmy. I really do. He's such a threat in the passing game. But that's about where the love stops for me. He is a TE. To be a TE, you have to be more than a receiver. You have to have the physical assets of a lineman, and the finesse assets of a wide receiver. You have to be some mixture of fast, good hands, quick reflexes, good route running, powerful, hard to move, tough, and a bruiser. Jimmy is about half of those things. Sure, when he's having a big game, he has a tendency to drag defenders. But go look at our losses this year. Then, in those losses, look at how the opponent limited Graham's effectiveness. (Patriots, Seahawks, and Panthers respectively). You put one guy in his face all game that will knock the piss out of him play after play, and he fucking quits. There's no sugar coating it. When the defenses get physical, he fucking quits. Love I hate it, be in different to it, I dot care, but what Bruce Irvin said about Jimmy is true. ""He's a big body that likes to make easy catches in zone coverage"". That is absolutely true. To take from the Seattle game, there is absolutely no way Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman should be contesting passes to him one on one. Go look at the film from the Seattle game. He fucking quit halfway through the first half. He was mailing it in every play after the first quarter. Physical defenses get into his head and affect his game. That is absolutely not what you want in a TE. I love the guy, but I would not be upset if we parted ways. I would be ok with having Ben Watson be our number 1."

arichi,personalfinance,1390022255.0,"First, the interest you paid will be deducted come tax time.  You don't get it all back (far from it), but it means it isn't as much as you think it is.

Second, what's the interest rate on the loans?  That might not be toxic debt.  I still have student loans at 1.9%.  They're getting the minimum payments each month.   Yeah, I'm paying interest, but I'm fine with that.  
(I'm aware that, in the worst case, my assets can be wiped out and I'm still saddled with that debt.  I'm debating paying off my student loans just to be done with them).

Third, the liquidity of keeping your savings in cash while you were in school might have been worth something.  What if your car died and you needed another?  What if... well, any number of things.  So just because you paid interest doesn't mean the loans are automatically bad.

I paid more than you did in interest last year - it isn't all student loans - and I don't regret a thing.  None of my debt is toxic and none is a burden."

I also like multitasking most of the time and switch constantly between various conversation, game, and web windows in the desktop environment. The full-screen, one at a time metro app system just is too slow and tedious compared to spreading these things out over the desktop where I can track multiple conversations easily while watching Netflix or reading reddit. 

The old start menu seemed quicker because I'd just hit my start key and either hit up arrow a few times or type the first few letters of the program I wanted and it would come up so I didn't have to mouse far or look over the entire screen to find what I wanted. I can understand why the big start screen would be good for navigating by finger but it really seems like a waste of space when using a computer without a touch screen because it feels quicker to mouse over to a specific item when the area is more compact, plus you don't have to block your view of the other things you're running.

&gt; I understand that I need to compare the pitch of the harmonic with different saddle positions and the exact same tuning...that's what I did


Why does the pitch of the harmonic even matter when intonation adjustments should be being performed by using a chromatic tuner for all pitch measurements. Harmonics do not even need to be involved in intonation setting AT ALL WHATSOEVER.

TheDrunkenChud,AskReddit,1390022546.0,"it's more the media's fault than anything. when's the last time they had a presidential debate with more than 2 candidates after the primaries? sure, you hear from the candidate pool of the two main parties, but the media doesn't cover the other candidates. how is a candidate supposed to win if they're constantly being slighted and, well, oppressed by the news whose job it is to inform the public, yet, instead keeps us uninformed as to all our choices. sure, people that want to vote 3rd party do so and investigate, but no one is giving that person's candidate a chance. when the tea party came on the scene like gang busters the news immediately started calling them racists and bigots and anything they could to make them toxic. oprah said they wanted to enslave her and people because they wanted to ""get back to the constitution"". when you have two parties who completely control the spotlight and a media that caters to it, then you are locked into the bullshit we're embroiled in. fuck this system. fuck these politicians. fuck it all. let's burn this motherfucker down pookie!"

fiat_lux_,TheBluePill,1390022581.0,"There's both expensive and inexpensive places in Oakland. The hills and northern parts like Piedmont are very expensive. A friend of mine lives there and his house costed in the range of 1.5 to 2 million. Then as you go West, the places get shadier. Rent might be cheaper, but I've never had the incentive to live there, so I don't have experience. All I know is that I and a group of elderly I was with got mugged there. A friend who works in Oakland and passes by got mugged twice while going to work. Too many people I know including myself have had problems in the area, so even if I had the incentive (if I had work close by in Oakland) I'd have still avoided it.

Depending on how ghetto you want to go, rent *can* be cheap. I've lived from box to box in places like SF for as low as 390 USD a month (that place was a 6x7 box), but it takes time to find those places. I've never fled from home, but if I had to, I'd need to find a job and a place fast. Meanwhile, I'd be paying 60-100 USD per day on a motel or something. Also, I'd have to meet he landlord/landlady. Most have accepted me as I have stable income, a sizable savings, and friendly/harmless disposition, but I'm guessing that they'd be less accepting of a runaway. 

With connections, yeah, it's possible. The problem with these people stuck outside the BART transit web is that they usually don't have connections to the Bay. I imagine it would be even harder for someone in SoCal (like LA area) to have connections in the Bay. 

Overall, I'm guessing from my gedankenexperiments and my own connections that it's an intimidating idea for anyone dreaming of fleeing here."

nicholasferber,technology,1390022720.0,"I may agree to other things, however I haven't had problems with drivers or hardware not being recognized and I've gone through 2 vaios, HP pavilion and thinkpad laptops since ubuntu 8.04. Every time I installed the OS, it only involved popping in the CD(now USB) a few clicks and then done. I have not dealt with the command line and mucked around with configuration files or whatever people do with Linux. The only struggles I have had is post install when I try to get the latest version of CUDA working and with that of course bumblebee with the latest nvidia driver because I want to, not because it was needed. When a security update occurs I get a prompt saying that I need to restart the system.

Regarding command line, yes I do use command line for things like extracting a few pages from different PDFs and making a new PDF out of it or resizing all the images on a folder but I do not require it just to make my machine work. Installing software can be done using the Ubuntu store but I choose to use the command line because it is faster for me.

I don't know what kind of problems you have experienced but I have hardly had the need to ask something on a forum mostly because it has already been asked and answered and the thread has been closed. Even when I have asked some questions there hasn't been any flinging of poo at all.

Let me admit one thing. I am am advanced user of Linux. Having said that I just an end user and I do not spend time on writing some obscure script or maintaining packages. I install the OS when I feel like getting the new shiny gnome shell and then proceed to muck around with CUDA, OpenCL and C++ because that is what I do. I do not muck around with the OS or try to pry open the internals and be one with kernel. I am a computational guy rather than a computer guy and I love it when I can open my laptop and get on to work in 2 seconds rather than wait for the OS to stutter and be operational after 5-10 mins of shitting itself.

Well, I guess congratulations. But has it occurred to you that encouraging a bunch of basement neckbeards to believe that no means maybe might not be the greatest fucking idea? Nobody is saying that notions about consent need to be taken with braindead literal-mindedness or that drunk sex is automatically rape. But the impetus is _on dudebro to figure out the fucking difference._ That's how consent works. And it is entirely legitimate to err on the side of caution and say that you need explicit consent. In fact, it's prudent to do so.  

_But TRP is all about eroding that shit._ If you're all so preoccupied with ambiguous drunken frathouse sex where men are falsely accused, why the broadsides about feminism? Well, because y'all love rapey amibiguous drunken frathouse sex and want to extend that shit into society as far as possible. Except that's how people get actually raped.

ztj,technology,1390022852.0,"I've enjoyed the Wii U for a few games, but, there just isn't much there that isn't on a bunch of other platforms. I also don't buy into the touchpad gimmick, it's maybe fun for a tiny slice of game types that involve a larger group of players, but, that just never happens. I only know a handful of gamers and none ever want to play party games.

The only games that will fill my couch will be Mario Kart and Smash, which I can't wait for btw. I do sometimes enjoy the pad for playing some SNES games, but, let's be honest, we've been able to easily acquire and play those on a computer for 15 years. I only buy them out of respect, not as a feature of the system, especially since they have been added ridiculously slowly, 1 or less per week.

Anyway, I like a whole set of things that Nintendo does, but, I just don't think it's enough to justify a console for most people. I'm sure I will play all the main Nintendo properties (mario, zelda, HOPEFULLY METROID, smash bros., Pok√©mon, etc.) but I would be 100% as likely to play them if they were sold for, say, iPhone and expected me to jam my phone into a Nintendo branded peripheral or something. I'd be fine with that too. Nintendo makes games worth going out of your way to play for me, but, I guess not many other people.

As far as those talking about waiting for a new Zelda, you got it already, the best new Zelda in 20 years is on 3DS, a Link Between Worlds. This one game justifies buying a 3DS, then there's others (Fire Emblem!). The 3DS is a much better proposition than the Wii u right now."

Letterstothor,science,1390022854.0,"In my experience, religion has made life harder for my family members to deal with hardship. When you think that justice and love are innate concepts of the universe, hard times make you feel like you've done something wrong and are being punished, but the onus is on you to figure out what it was and what needs to change.

I'd been hit from the left and driven up over the inside curb at turn 1 at Monza so many times I figured I'd pull ""An Alonso"" and stick to the outside, only to find that in avoiding each other - which they're quite bad at - they were swinging wide to hit me...

Edit: Not really anything to do with personality or if the person was angry while writing it, though that can be perceived if the marks are deep and quickly written with splotches and angry scratches which can tell if the person is angry, but that's not really from the handwriting itself."

I was looking for a different drill, but I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRT-WcflZj0) that will most certainly get the job done on practicing the hip hinge. By removing the knees from the equation all together (and focusing on only hinging through the hips) this might help you get those glutes active naturally.

The reason you probably feel a lot of hammies in bird dog is because you over-arch your back and get the movement from your lower back rather than your abdominals + glutes. ;)

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390023430.0,"From my experience, women often seem to have a stronger instinct than men to want to parent a child that is not biologically their own.  Maybe you could say that biologically men are more wired to want to spread their DNA whereas women are more wired to care for whatever offspring come into their care. If someone handed me a baby and told me I was the only person who could care for it, I think I would love it like my own child. That is my theory. Of course, marrying someone with a child would not preclude having children together as a couple, so I guess this is only a halfway relevant theory. 

At this point in my life I would not consider dating a single father because I'm not ready to settle down yet and I think that would make me incompatible with him. I have a strong drive to nurture and I'm afraid that it would kick in at the expense of my other plans. I love kids and I think I would probably fall in love with his kid and want to make things work when maybe it wouldn't be realistic. However, I would definitely consider it down the line when I feel I am more ready for a relationship that could potentially lead to building a family. "

arichi,AdviceAnimals,1390024102.0,"I hope you find the following rant amusing.  I get this all the time, everything from freshmen to graduate students.  And I'm regularly called various things when they don't get the higher grade.

Never fails (pun intended), end of the term, I get plenty of emails -- after grades have been submitted, mind you -- from students telling me why I should raise their grade.  I entertain the requests based on performance in the class, but those are a tiny minority of requests.

Popular reasons I get grade-change requests:

* ""I need (grade) to keep my scholarship, and I only got (lower grade).""

* ""I need (grade) to pass this class, and I only got (lower grade).""

* ""I wanted to graduate this term, but I need (grade) in your class to do so.  You only gave me (lower grade).""

Now, if any of them had come to me, say, week one or two, telling me that they absolutely needed a certain grade in the class, I'd keep an eye on them and, if it looked like they might not at some point, I'd inform them -- and make appointments with them to help them with the material, give them more study questions, that sort of thing.

Of course, I frequently look at the entries in the gradebook for students making the ""I need (higher grade)"" requests -- sure enough, they're usually missing homework submissions (entirely, not even half-assing it), or have _really_ poor exam scores, or really poor lab grades (usually for not following spec... as in, so far from spec that it isn't even funny.)  It's like... if you really needed the higher grade, couldn't you have done the simple things right at least?

But yeah, I'm the selfish asshole because he's not getting an A after, among other things, not submitting three labs that were worth a combined 15% of his grade -- labs that most of his classmates got 100% on."

nostalgicBadger,AskMen,1390024249.0,"When you're meeting someone and exchanging names is always a good time to shake hands. Greeting or saying goodbye to someone who you don't see very often also works. Sometimes it's appropriate to hug women instead of shaking hands, but that's a little more complicated.

ImaginaryDuck,AskMen,1390024330.0,"I was playing a game of pool with a friend at a bar. This random girl walks up to the table and gets in the way so that she can look at something under the table light. She was cute so I asked what was up and she showed me a ring she found outside on the ground, that she was trying to see if it was real. 

I convinced her to let me look at it and right as she is about to hand it to me, her overly protective BF comes out of nowhere and refuses to let me look at it. So I lie and say I'm a jeweler, he is skeptical and starts quizzing me so I pull some bullshit out of my ass about my favorite metals to work with. He finally lets me see it, I take one glance and toss it back saying ""Fake"".

He gets all quizzical about how I know. ""Well do you see that embossed inscription on the inside of the band? It says Taiwan."" The guy gets all macho and calls winner at the pool table which is acceptable bar rules, but he then sits by the table, ignoring his GF, critiquing every shot I make. 

Now I didn't care about the game to begin with and didn't want to be around this asshole anymore so I threw the game and let him play my friend. I then sat down at his table in his chair and proceeded to chat up and flirt with his GF for about 20 minutes, in front of his speechless friends. Which he didn't even notice because he was too busy focusing on the game with my friend.

laxt,Games,1390024339.0,"I think it's way more complicated than that.  After all, this is the same company that took an enormous risk in the late '80s in throwing nearly all its might behind a black-and-yellow screened portable gaming system that wasn't even backlit.  Fast forward to today, and now Nintendo has held the reigns as the leader in sales in portable gaming since.. well.. the late '80s, really.  And not without having much competition!

I tend to be a Sony/Playstation person, but will still give Nintendo it's due as far as innovation with gaming is concerned.  In fact, it seems to me that Nintendo still holds the edge in the motion-sensing games market.  Sure, Kinect and PS Move may be technologically superior (or, as far as what I gather, they are), but the actual games that actually implement this technology for those respective systems are pretty much garbage.  And I have a PS Move, by the way.  Got it cheap one day; haven't yet set it up with the room space to really take advantage of the games I have that use it.

TL;DR - Nintendo's culture is this culture for good reason, even if sometimes cracks are revealed in the facade so to speak."

Reason-and-rhyme,writing,1390024767.0,"One of many reasons Fallout: New Vegas was the better of the two Bethesda releases. It had a variety of possible endings but they were completely mutually exclusive. Many choices even early in the game create unavoidable consequences. Not to mention the characters were generally more interesting and varied, and your character wasn't some sort of Chosen One. Just an ordinary person with a Pip-boy and the ability to learn new skills and shoot em up. 

In general, I tend to like modern or post-modern settings more than historical or alt-fantasy settings, because of how combat has transitioned to easy to use weapons. In fantasy settings, all too often the protagonist is the protagonist because they have an inborn trait or it's their ""destiny"" - they're the only one who can use magic Z. A story where the characters fight with guns and not magic allows a humble/dark/unremarkable character backstory to be believable."

ShamelesslyPlugged,40krpg,1390024777.0,"Well, you can always go for extra power in the Star Trek sense. The extra reactor bonus in BFG let the ship go faster.  

So, obviously when it comes to giving the ship power, you want it to be a reasonable amount so the group can do stuff, but also have a ceiling. However, you do have a small clipper that's mostly engines, so you can always fiat that there's just not room, although I think there's already a space stat - don't remember ship creation off the top of my head.  

Probably how I'd approach surplus power generation would be a Divert Power! special rule. Power to shields to recharge an extra void shield, power to engines to squeeze out a couple points of speed, and power to thrusters to increase the maneuvering bonus. You could arguably add power to turrets (a small bonus to fighting off fighters) or power to Gellar Field (let's them have warp incursions dealt with. Obviously it would have to be someone techy doing it.  

Then, depending on how malicious you feel, there's a chance of it burning out. It could be a 96-00 roll. It could be any 9's rolled. It could be a GM dice rolled behind the screen. I'd try to make it a 5-10% chance. If it happens, the system burns out and needs repairs and requires 10 degrees of success to repair (or whatever number you like). If they burn a fate point, the system will return in 2-3 turns as blessings need to be said to put in a new fuse."

ScipiiRye,news,1390025085.0,"Oh, wow, a feminist who actually has done some reading. Good for you, I have to say I'm surprised.

&gt; modern feminists, at least a large percentage of them, are concerned with the elimination of gender roles that do a disservice to men as well.

Yeah, I'd love to see some sort of evidence of that. That's the response that feminists usually give when their movement gets criticised, it's not any different than saying ""feminism = gender equality"" which is a massive oversimplification. 

Academic feminism, the kind taught in universities, is driven by the radicals, and ""mainstream"" feminism does more to perpetuate inaccurate satistics about rape and ""rape culture,"" myths about the ""wage gap,"" and painting unrealistic portraits of violence against women (every 15 seconds a woman is beaten, yet men are statistically more likely to be the victims of violence), than ""break down negative gender roles"". Look at what people think of AVFM and similar organisations.

Don't even get me started about the mess that's ""intersectional feminism.""

&gt; cherry-picking

Are they not feminists? Do their quotes not concern rape? Not a lot of feminists have the balls to admit that false rape accusations occur, or that women (being people) lie all the time about other stuff, so I think it would be more accurate to accuse someone of cherry-picking if a feminist had something *fair* to say about rape.

And the ""radical feminism died with the second wave"" line is neat, but you still have people like hooks and Greer running around spouting the same type of shit that was forty years ago, and people listen to them.

But I digress, we're talking about rape, here, not feminism in general. I've given you a couple feminist quotes about rape, and you've tried to write them off as ""oh they're radicals, they're not *real* feminists."""

His green deck is extremely dangerous with plenty of outs.

His shell is similar to yours, except he has 4 eternal witnesses and 4 genesis waves. 

The game plan goes something like this (his ""nut"" draw that happened like 3 times in a span of a week);

T1: Forest, Elvish Mystic/Arbor Elf

T2: Tap Elvish/Arbor to play Utopian Sprawl, Play Nykthos, Tap Utopian Sprawl Forest for 2 for 1 Burning Tree Emissary, use the floating 2 mana to tap Nykthos for 4 green devotion to play Garruk. +1 the Garruk to untap Nykthos and Forest. You now have 6 devotion. Use Nykthos to play Primeval Titan and look for Kessig Wolf Run + Forest. 

T3: Play a Forest; you now have 4 mana sources, 1 Kessig Wolf Run and 1 Nykthos on the board with 8 devotion, 1 mana dork and 1 Garruk. Tap 2 to for Nykthos to add 8 floating tap the utopian sprawl forest to activate Kessig Wolf Run. Use Garruk to untap Nykthos and the Utopian Sprawl forest, use utopian sprawl to activate Nykthos again, add in the other mana dorks, and you get a **30+/6 Trample to swing for lethal**. 

Me: ^uh...path ^to ^exile? xD

edit;

But kidding aside, EVEN if I do path to exile him, T4 he'll Genesis Wave for 16, and will keep chaining it with Eternal Witness until he drops a Crater Hoof Behemoth and swings again for 40/40. AND if I somehow manage to fog for some ungodly reason. He'll have his entire deck of creatures out.

The Griffon, though. Morrow save me. Any infantry slightly reasonable DEF just straight up dies with the trample - even shield wallers die on average.

(I'm not sure, though. It may depend on the location.)

A lot of stores like Ann Taylor and The Limited give you coupons when you shop there that you have a limited window to use. So don't buy everything you want at once. But a bit, get the coupons and then go back. 

For cheaper options, Burlington Coat Factory often has a nice petite suiting section. I have found some really nice discounted things there. Nordstrom Rack is also good, but on the more expensive side. You can also try Ross/Marshalls/TJ Maxx. Those places will require a lot more work for you to find what you want because a lot of their stuff is low quality, but when you do find something that works, it's usually a steal. If you can wear dresses to work, they are great places to buy dresses. I like wearing dresses and skirts because it's hard to find pants that are too big/long. One of my best pairs of black pants is something I got from the Girls' section of JCPenney when I was 12. LOL. It has somehow lasted me 10 years...

Like the NSA reform obama undertook. I find it hard to believe a government that depends on the financial sector will actually want considerable reform.

Without the EU the UKIP is non-existent politically, that libertarian bullshit is just so they don't appear to be fixated on the nationalist issue.

It is quite overwhelming to switch a phone over. I think they do that on purpose, just so you'll buy a new phone instead! :( If it works for you that way, then definitely do that! I used to have an old flip phone that I used for just calls and text, while using my iPod for music and surfing the net when I was out (on Wi-Fi). It wasn't a bad set up, though I got into a habit of never answering my phone because I was playing with my iPod haha. 

Yea, I assumed they had faded SIM cards out, but I was talking to my SO and asking his opinion on your mission and he said that we have them in our phones. I guess I wasn't paying attention when the guy at the store set up my phone! :)

Hmmm. I've never experienced that, well I've never switched a phone over to Walmart so I haven't messed with their SIM card switch. I had just purchased a phone through them, one of those slidey keyboard phones. That does seem like they are giving people the run around. I know companies are adamant about people returning phones/minutes. 

If you are going to go with a new phone, Walmart has another option as well. It's Straight Talk. I'm not sure if they are the same thing now. I know Walmart has a plan set-up. I think I saw the green boxes for the Straight Talk still there last time I was in. [Here is the website.](http://www.straighttalk.com/wps/portal/home/shop/phones?utm_source=IMM&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=DR#.UtoaQhBdXQg)

I think they are on a similar phone range (service range) as Verizon. They have $30 plans and up. It's pre-paid. You can buy cards at Walmart or online. I had this service as well, it was good. I had no issues. They have a wide range of phones to choose from.

Another example of this that I learned about more recently is the French headscarf affairs.  With public support French officials tried to ban young Muslim school girls from wearing headscarves to school, claiming that they represented Islamic encroachment upon French secular society.

My dad used to work at the sugar beet processing plant here in Fargo and the place is a unionized workplace. When contract negotiations came up a couple years ago the union demanded a pay raises and the company responded by locking them out and bringing in scabs. The lockout lasted over a year year and a lot of locked out workers, including my dad, gave up and got new jobs. The union capitulated and agreed to a new contract with no pay increases, but the damage was already done.

The economic downturn and the Taft-Hartley neutering of unions makes it impossible for unions to get leverage against employers, essentially, without breaking the law (say, physically attacking scabs, or doing a sit-in strike) and inviting state repression."

I like it a lot, but I just want to spend most of my time taking care of patients. That's what we're *supposed* to be doing right?

Core i3 - plenty of power on a budget.

B85 Architecture - more upgradable

MSI Twin Frozr GTX 770 - one of the best coolers around.

1 x 8GB stick of serviceable RAM - You can add more 8GB sticks later, just make sure when you plug the one in for dual-channel, it's a clone of the stick you have in there. Why spend more money than you have to by spreading out 4 x 4GB? You'd just limit your maximum capacity to your budget.

NZXT Source 210 Elite is a solid case. 

1 TB WD Caviar Blue - standard, serviceable for gaming.

LG BD Media Player - if you're going to spend $20 to get a media player, why not spend an extra $30 and be able to run an HDMI cable to your TV to watch Blu-ray?

Added a wireless internet card.

PSU - 600W will be plenty with this setup, and you'll have some wiggle room for later expansions. The Bronze rating just means that if you leave your computer on all day, you'll have an extra 5 bucks on your power bill at the end of the month if you're comparing it to say, going with an 80+ Gold certified PSU.

That monitor is pretty decent: 5ms refresh rate (lower is better), LED, IPS, Large display... not bad for $150. You won't find many IPS displays that have a refresh rate under 5ms, and when you do, they're around $500. Some gamers prefer the refresh rate over IPS, but recently, IPS has made a comeback (it's not new technology). It's just a different way of arranging the pixels (sort of).

imbreaststroke,funny,1390025967.0,"Usually a swim practice is overseen by a coach who makes a workout, always (or 90% of the time) having a purpose for anything that is swam.  Usually, before a set (a portion of the workout), the coach will say why they put the set into the workout or the coach will say what to pay attention to while you're swimming the set.

When swimming freestyle (front crawl), you are looking down at the bottom of the pool so your face is fully submerged.  When you breathe, you turn your head with your body instead of lifting your head up (basically looking forward above the water).  Similarly, when you swim backstroke (back crawl) your face is looking straight up, and your head is above water so breathing is almost a piece of cake.

Breaststroke has a natural method for breathing, if you swim it properly your head will lift up at the correct moment so you don't have to cause the breath to happen.  Butterfly, on the other hand, is basically lifting your head to look forward but it doesn't hurt you like in freestyle (since your body moves in a wave like motion from torso to toes).

Technique can mean the difference in a 1st place finish and a disqualification (though DQs happen more with younger swimmers or all-around ages at an outdoor meet in the winter).  It can also mean not wasting unnecessary energy, because if a swimmer had perfect form they will swim through the water with the least drag humanly possible."

&gt;If you can look at this woman and call her fat, you have a problem. No one in their right mind would call this woman fat. I can understand someone calling her overweight, although I don't agree with that. 

You don't agree that she's overweight? It's fine that you don't agree, but it's an [objective fact](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rateme/comments/1vhbuz/f19_is_my_body_keeping_me_from_being_attractive/cese2aq) (see the BMI point) that she is. I agree with everything in the post I just linked by the way.


&gt;I am not even aware of this ""fat acceptance"" movement you speak of. The movement I am aware of that has been around since the early nineties, probably before you were born, is the skinnier is healthier movement that has created women to be anorexic and bulimic. This is a serious disease in our culture where women look at celebrities, models on magazine covers, and dolls such as Barbie, and see a standard they can never meet. 

Nice ad hominem. I do agree with your statements about popular culture creating an unattainable body image though. There is a widespread use of Photoshop for magazine covers and the like, and that's not even covering models with eating disorders. It does create a standard that cannot be healthily met.

&gt;This craze is furthered by people like you who call any woman that is not a stick figure fat.

[That woman is far from a stick figure!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1vgacy/cant_even_run_to_the_next_street/) She is obviously unhealthy, and you're enabling her to stay as she is (although luckily she seems to be ignoring your ""advice""). Seriously, you are LYING to not only her, but every overweight, unhealthy person you've ever offered your ""advice"" to. Frankly, it's disgusting.

&gt;I feel sorry for any woman that has to be exposed to you because likely they develop a complex where they develop unhealthy habits that make them too skinny. 

Not every woman who is told that she's overweight automatically becomes an anorexic trainwreck! The women you speak of could develop healthy habits that help them get down to a manageable weight.

&gt;It is actually much less healthy to be underweight than to be overweight. 

Both are equally unhealthy. The optimal healthy weight is somewhere in the middle of those two extremes.

&gt;More women are having heart attacks and other health problems today because of eating disorders where they are not eating enough, than women who are overweight. 

I'd like a citation for that.

&gt;The OP is not overweight, and if you look at the comments here, at least 90% agree with me. 

Please see my above comment (the one you responded to). Reddit is full of white knights, you included. Nobody wants to tell the truth here because it's not ""the nice thing to do"". The people that do tell the truth usually get downvoted, as evidenced by every post in this subreddit (bar the hideous people that everyone can agree on). It does not help your argument that a bunch of white knights agree with your sentiments. An analogous situation would be asking a bunch of neo-Nazis to back you up when you say Hitler did nothing wrong.

&gt;So go back to your parents basement, and shut your mouth.

Finishing strong with another ad hominem. Nice. Doesn't it concern you that you have to attack my personal character to discredit my argument?

jolene_jolene_jolene,TumblrInAction,1390026096.0,"Ah, maybe I was confusing. She thinks the question, ""Is it hard  for you to be the boss?"" is stupid because it's not a question typically asked of men and she doesn't get why, after all the premium bossing about she's done, she has to hear it: 

""Why is this book called 'Bossypants?' One, because the name 'Two and a Half Men' was already taken. And two, because ever since I became an executive producer of '30 Rock,' people have asked me, 'Is it hard for you, being the boss?' and 'Is it uncomfortable for you to be the person in charge?' You know, in the same way they say, 'Gosh, Mr. Trump, is it awkward for you to be the boss of all these people?' I can't answer for Mr. Trump, but in my case it is not.""

Her position through out the book is this: If the person trying to hold you down for your gender has no control over hiring or firing you, then just work really hard and be great at what you do and that's the ultimate comeuppance. 

On the other hand, SJW types and Radfems would find it totally impossible to overcome these kind of obstacles with hard work and talent, because they are very much aware that they have neither the drive or the ambition to be proactive in the face of nonsense and love having an excuse to say, ""SEE IT""S A MANS WORLD WHY EVEN TRY"" 

What I like about Ms. Fey is that she basically says, ""Being a lady in comedy was hard when I came up. Most of it was changed by being a funny person and showing people that there were lots of funny ways to write women and lots of female comics who were awesome and could be utilized in unexpected but still really funny ways.""

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1390026100.0,"&gt;**An** evolutionary psychology explanation for this is that malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins causes loss of hair or hair changes.

Emphasis mine. There are two evo-psych citations for **an** explanation to the suggestion that men across the board prefer long hair. It also says that Asian men prefer dark hair (which is what's the social norm). For a very long time, long hair with women was a social norm. Evo-psych also posits that men are attracted to ample breasts and hips but there are plenty of men out there who prefer stick-thin or at least less than voluptous women. Curves and long, healthy hair have long been a sign of wealth and pampered living, but as we are living in a time when short hair is *not* inherantly a sign of poor health, I can't agree that every single man out there thinks any given woman looks better with long hair."

karlmoebius,AskReddit,1390026160.0,"The last time was the may tornadoes in Oklahoma. The power was out, the wind was insane. I'm hearing regular cracks outside the house as trees on the property fall over. I'm afraid one will fall on the house. The seven story cottonwood at the road is practically bent in half. The house is rattling and the wind won't stop. The power's out, and it's storm-dark. I have a single candle lit, and my phone vibrates and asks me if I'm okay--there's a couple of tornadoes spotted a few miles away. The tornado sirens have been going off, off and on all evening. (the sirens will sound if there's a tornado anywhere in the county, so I'm used to them popping off and on during the season). Then they stayed on as the wind got worse, and the power went off.

My house doesn't have a basement. It's a flimsy 60's era house. It'll shred when the tornado hits it, and even a near miss will take all the trees nearby and pummel the house apart. My nearest shelter is a culvert 300 yards away across open ground. I know I'm going to die. I'm occasionally suicidal, so it was a relief it was finally going to happen. I sat in the dark, with the wind howling, looking at the candle, the siren going off, my mind going through my life coming to peace with myself. There were some pretty awful things about myself I realized about myself that night.

The storm calmed finally, the tornadoes stayed miles away, and I felt cheated that it didn't happen, honestly. I was ready, I had made peace with myself and I was just waiting for it to finally happen. 

I drove through Moore a week later to get to college to pay tuition for the summer semester, and there was an almost razor sharp demarcation between where the tornado was and wasn't. There were huge swaths of absolute nothing--everything razed to the ground. And part of me wished it was me, instead of them. Still does sometimes."

* Don't confuse lust with love. Just because you want to have sex with her, doesn't mean you want to date her. Know what you want and let her know.

* Don't be afraid of your sexual side. Don't be ashamed to make it known that you want someone sexually. This does not mean be a creepy pervert that doesn't respect personal space. This means not feeling embarrassed that you find someone sexually attractive and acting in a completely contradictory way.

Lastly - I used to get tormented for being gay and honestly used to be self conscious about it. However, when I adopted the ""I don't care what you think, this is me"" mentality and didn't give two shits what other people thought of me, I started getting a ton more respect and actually became pretty popular once I started high school.

My beef is that so much time and energy is spent on redirecting criticism of the current state of feminism onto the radicals for everything that's wrong with the ideology. 

If ""feminism"" is being ""taken over"" by radicals the same way that Occupy Wall Street was, a isn't it time to maybe ditch the label and embrace real egalitarianism, and not stick with arguably self-interested feminism?

JustRuss79,technology,1390026954.0,"Right,  Metro is ahead of its time.  The business world especially is not ready for a touch oriented interface in its main operating system.  Metro should have been an option on top of a windows 7 type desktop.  To be enabled when needed, rather than forced onto the consumer.

If the desktop were available in some positions or when attached to the keyboard/in a laptop configuration; but automatically switched to metro when it detected a landscape or portrait mode (or undocked) then it would make much more sense.

It feels as though businesses were a second thought to Microsoft with the release of Windows 8.  Especially considering that some older programs don't even run on the platform.  Most people who are comfortable with Windows, are such because they use it at work.  When they get a PC for home, most choose Windows due to familiarity.  But in this case, it is as if they expected the opposite to happen.  For users to insist on adopting windows 8 once they were accustomed to it for home use.

Were that the case, the business world would have a lot more Mac's thanks to college students preferring them; and with a wider market, there would be better business/corporate oriented programs for OSX.  But it doesn't work that way.

Windows 9 will probably be amazing though,   Windows ME was a flop, but introduced many elements that ended up in XP and 2000.  Windows Vista was crap (at least at first) and flopped, but introduced many improvements that ended up in Win7.   And I think Win 7 is one of the best operating systems I have ever used! I've loved it since early public beta.

Windows 8 is definitely the new vista, just as vista was the 'new ME'."

Nogbadd,AskMen,1390027850.0,"&gt;is not a very useful stance if you‚Äôre trying to attract women, not men.

Yes, what men need is more advice from women on how to be a man. That's *exactly* what men need. 

&gt;Isn‚Äôt forcing yourself on a woman just because you happen to be horny considered‚Ä¶.well, rape? (Ooops).

Ah, yes, men, sex, creep, pervert, sex, dirty...rape. You couldn't help yourself could you?

My advice? Your stereotyping of men (driven by lust, incompetent fumbling, likely to rape unless they are reminded not to) is patronising in conception, and is executed in a condescending and superficial way. If you want to advise men, describe some specific ""tips"" from a female's point of view. For example,  you might invent three women (being representative of the diversity of women's perspectives) and describe what each of these different women might want from her man. 

Personally, I find your writing offensive, as the conflation of male sexuality and rape is a red flag for me. And the whole notion that women can develop guidance on being a man is utterly preposterous. But maybe that's just me. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2KPeMcYsuc) is what has influenced my opinion; don't be that girl!

Random coffee and some work-related phone calls between grownups are cool.

So it is up to you to have boundaries on your end and only hang out with people who respect your relationship too. No need to kick someone off the island just for gender if they can otherwise play nice."

Conclusion: Current prospective cohort data from adults in North America and Europe raise the possibility that a lifestyle pattern that includes a very low meat intake is associated with greater longevity.



http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/study-links-vegetarian-diets-and-longevity/2013/06/07/1bc9b382-ce0f-11e2-9f1a-1a7cdee20287_story.html

Large-scale studies have shown that mortality from ischaemic heart disease was 30% lower among vegetarian men and 20% lower among vegetarian women than in non-vegetarians.[35][36] Vegetarian diets offer lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol and animal protein, and higher levels of carbohydrates, fibre, magnesium, potassium, folate, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and phytochemicals.[37][38]
Vegetarians tend to have lower body mass index,[39] lower levels of cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and less incidence of heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, renal disease, metabolic syndrome,[40] dementias such as Alzheimer's disease and other disorders.[41] Non-lean red meat, in particular, has been found to be directly associated with increased risk of cancers of the esophagus, liver, colon, and the lungs.[42] Other studies have shown no significant differences between vegetarians and non-vegetarians in mortality from cerebrovascular disease, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer.[35] A 2010 study compared a group of vegetarian and meat-eating Seventh-day Adventists in which vegetarians scored lower on depression tests and had better mood profiles.[43]

In Mortality in British vegetarians,[95] a similar conclusion is drawn: ""British vegetarians have low mortality compared with the general population.

ife expectancies of California Adventist men and women are higher than those of any other well-described natural population"" at 78.5 years for men and 82.3 years for women. The life expectancy of California Adventists surviving to age 30 was 83.3 years for men and 85.7 years for women.[97]

a vegetarian diet was estimated to confer an extra 1‚Äì1/2 to 2 years of life. 

""Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans?"" published in American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, which concluded that low meat eating (less than once per week) and other lifestyle choices significantly increase life expectancy, relative to a group with high meat intake. The study concluded that ""The findings from one cohort of healthy adults raises the possibility that long-term (‚â• 2 decades) adherence to a vegetarian diet can further produce a significant 3.6-y increase in life expectancy.

A study by the Institute of Preventive and Clinical Medicine, and Institute of Physiological Chemistry looked at a group of 19 vegetarians (lacto-ovo) and used as a comparison a group of 19 omnivorous subjects recruited from the same region. The study found that this group of vegetarians (lacto-ovo) have a significantly higher amount of plasma carboxymethyllysine and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) compared to this group of non-vegetarians.[100] 

In about a six-year span, 2,570 of the participants died. Overall, vegetarians were 12 percent less likely to have died in that time than were non-vegetarians. Mortality rates were lowest for vegans, lacto-ovo vegetarians and pesco-vegetarians. Male vegetarians were somewhat less likely to have died than female vegetarians.

Plenty of shows make the mistake of changing a character for such a second, whether it's a line or an action, or their trust of someone, or all of a sudden mercy, that breaks everything.  Firefly had amazing character's pretty much throughout, as well as a very well made world.

Not only is it that, but every character is very likable in their own way.  All the main characters are likable in their own way, and can be your favorite for any reason.  While many people settle on one character, wash, in particular as their favorite, there are still plenty of people that have chosen any of the others as their favorite for an reason.

Earth became a mix of two countries, China and America, they are now the alliance, and watching the show will reveal the big deal with who they are, why people like/dislike them, and what the disagreement meant to the crew of the ship.

The world is a unique mix of old time/western world's where the poor tend to live, and the sci-fi style on the rich worlds.  You encounter a few different cultures and classes throughout the show, but they all feel natural, despite the setting.

It's just fluid.  And no one can deny that even if it was an amazing show, a large part of it's appeal is the single season.  Not just that it deserved another, but that means that these character's and world we encountered we only got a glance of, and we want to see more.  The main plotline as well is quite intriguing, but not fleshed out enough due to the time limit of the show.  it leaves us wanting it to keep going, but we got no closure."

xthorgoldx,pics,1390029201.0,"That ""half assed thing the size of a football field"" was the concerted effort of two decades of work by the world's space programs. Just because the US doesn't prioritize its space budget doesn't mean the ISS is a half-effort.


The ISS took two decades and $200 billion to bring to its current state, and most of that cost is in surface-to-LEO launch costs. Its mass is 450,000kg (990,000lbs), and that had to be split up into several *hundred* launches. This isn't Kerbal Space Program where you can just strap boosters on until its TW ratio is &gt;1 and parts are cheap.

Anything significantly larger than the ISS, for structural costs alone, would not only be prohibitively expensive (in the scale of trillions) but beyond our current tools for space construction. It took the crew of the ISS three 8-hour spacewalks to fix a *water pump* last Christmas; how many people and how much time would it take to do *construction jobs* in space? Where's the infrastructure for those workers?

[Here's a link to a related study I did for a fictional, but similar-scale spaceship, the UNSC Infinity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1cc10g/how_much_do_you_think_the_unsc_infinity_would/c9fc64n?context=1) For example, let's take a Nimitz-Class carrier from the US Navy. It's practically a spaceship in all but propulsion and location; it's self-sufficient to a large degree and houses more than 1,000 people. How much would it cost to put it into orbit? **702 billion.** Note that it took $4.5 billion to produce in a terrestrial drydock, that cost can't even be calculated without making huge assumptions about the cost of orbital shipyards. Also, this doesn't count for additional life support systems and propulsion systems for a goddamn 104,600 ton hunk of metal.

*Something that costs nearly 10% of the United States' GDP just to get into orbit, let alone build, operate, and maintain is*  ***not*** *something that's within practical reach of current tech.*

=======

Y'know what, for fun, let's scale it from the ISS, with some concessions to give your hopes and dreams a chance. Let's assume that the UNSS *Oilrig* costs half as much, per pound, to build as the ISS did and has a total mass equal to a Nimitz-class carrier, including life-support and nonexistant propulsion systems that'd let it be mobile. 

The mass of a Nimitz-class carrier is 104,600 long tons, or 234,304,000 pounds. The ISS is 990,000 pounds. Scaling up directly, the UNSS *Oilrig* is 236 times as heavy, so it'll cost our arbitrary 118 times as much to build.

The ISS cost $150 billion at the 2010 estimate. 

    1.5e+11 * 118 = 1.77e+13
    17,700,000,000,000

$17 trillion dollars. For reference, the GDP of the *combined word* was $45 trillion in 2012.

**SOMETHING THAT COSTS 37% OF THE ECONOMIC PRODUCT OF THE WORLD IS NOT ""POSSIBLE IF WE WANTED TO""**

Note, I'm not saying that means it'll never be practical - but saying that the only reason we're not building massive spaceships is because we're not giving NASA a blank check is *moronic* and, frankly, insulting to everyone and anyone who works in space - they work with insufficient budgets, dangerous technology (let's ride a pile of *explosives* into the sky!), and pioneering techniques and *still* pull of stuff that knocks the socks off of people... and you dare say that their work is ""half-assed.""

I'm not seeking an explanation as to why all or even most men prefer long hair, because despite there being a brief Wikipedia article offering **an** explanation as to why some men prefer long hair, I am not convinced that it is some kind of biological fact.

I think Skyward Sword really nailed home the point, that Nintendo just wasn't able to give me the kind of games I wanted anymore. 

I got my first PS3 to play Metal Gear Solid 4. That was pretty much the most emotional game I'd played at that point.

Life-in-Death,TrueReddit,1390029760.0,"Sorry, I am over-source-ing on another thread and its late:

1. My main concern with GM is that it does can spread.  Anything that can alter nature irriversably is a little worrisome for me.  I used to work in a biological control lab and it petrified me.

2. Cross-pollinating is an issue, but primarily with corn, soy only in small amounts.  The real issue it looks like is the organic farmers can no longer sell their crops as organic.  My issue with Monsanto comes primarily from their practices in places like Malawi.  I found the full Monsanto/soy story and it is posted below.


Quote/Link dump, and good night.

&gt;In April, The Wall Street Journal tested twenty food products labeled ""GMO free"" and found that sixteen of them contained at least traces of genetically modified ingredients; five had significant amounts. One of the companies testing positive, albeit with trace amounts, was Nature's Path Foods, the largest organic cereal company in the world.

""We have found traces in corn that has been grown organically for ten to fifteen years,"" Arran Stephens, president of Nature's Path Foods, told The New York Times in June. ""There's no wall high enough to keep that stuff contained.""

https://www.progressive.org/0901/lil0901.html

&gt;The spokesman says that as many as one-third of organic corn loads test positive for GMOs at a low level. 'Ears of corn may have a handful of kernels that test positive. All we know is it's becoming an increasingly difficult issue.'

The spokesman says the farmers use non-GMO seed and take precautions to prevent contamination, such as planting later than neighboring GM farmers to avoid cross-pollination, isolating their crops from GM corn fields, and cleaning their harvesting and transportation equipment. But the measures haven't been enough to stop the incursion of GMOs.

- See more at: http://www.non-gmoreport.com/articles/apr10/organicfarmers_gmocontamination.php#sthash.7QJh51hL.dpuf
&gt;GMO ""contamination"" of non-GMO grain can occur in corn by virtue of either cross-pollination between adjacent fields of GMO and non-GMO hybrids or by commingling (a fancy term for ""mixing"") of seed. The latter can occur at planting time as farmers switch from planting one hybrid to another via seed carryover in the planter. Commingling can also occur during or after harvest time via grain mixing in the combine, trucks and wagons, drying facility or the storage facility.

&gt;He also says there is potential cross-pollination with soybeans even though they are self-pollinating plants.

- See more at: http://www.non-gmoreport.com/articles/apr10/organicfarmers_gmocontamination.php#sthash.7QJh51hL.dpuf



http://www.agry.purdue.edu/ext/corn/news/articles.00/GMO_Issues-000307.html

&gt;Genetically modified Roundup Ready soybeans have taken an increasingly larger percentage of US soybean acreage each year since their introduction in 1996, reaching 92% in 2008. - See more at: http://www.non-gmoreport.com/articles/mar09/farmers_planting_non-gmo_soybeans.php#sthash.tgkbkLgp.dpuf

&gt;So why is this a myth? It's certainly true that Monsanto has been going after farmers whom the company suspects of using GMO seeds without paying royalties. And there are plenty of cases ‚Äî including Schmeiser's ‚Äî in which the company has overreached, engaged in raw intimidation, and made accusations that turned out not to be backed up by evidence.

But as far as I can tell, Monsanto has never sued anybody over trace amounts of GMOs that were introduced into fields simply through cross-pollination. (The company asserts, in fact, that it will pay to remove any of its GMOs from fields where they don't belong.) If you know of any case where this actually happened, please let me know.

Omniscience: When Adam and Eve discover their nudity after eating the apple, their god doesn't know where they are, and he doesn't know what they've done. He has to ask to find out. Therefore, he is not all-knowing.


Omnipotence: Jacob beats his own god in a wrestling match and refuses to let him up until his family is blessed. Also, this god couldn't drive men out of a valley, because they had chariots of iron. Therefore, he is not all-powerful.

Goodness: This god punishes the wicked eternally in the lake of fire. Just a single person suffering eternally is infinitely worse than all of the suffering that has ever happened, is happening, or will ever happen. It's not just torture for untold trillions of millennia, but an infinite number of those. This god is directly responsible for infinite suffering. It is his will. That is simply the most evil design attributed to any character, divine or not. Therefore, not only is this god demonstrably NOT good, he is more evil than anything can possibly ever be."

[Here's a list of civilian nuclear accidents.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civilian_nuclear_accidents) Now, the list seems long at first... but then you realize ""nuclear accidents"" is defined as ""any time a reactor isn't running 100% as planned."" Coolant loop malfunctions, going to backups? Accident. 15 minutes of uncontrolled reaction due to control rod failure? Accident.

The majority of major nuclear accidents that are reported are either the result of sheer incompetence or are overblown.

* Chernobyl - The operators intentionally disabled the failsafes and put the plant into a state that would cause it to require failsafes. They essentially turned off the fire alarms and decided to have a bonfire in a dynamite warehouse. The scale of this one was horrific, but it wasn't the result of nuclear power being unsafe, but rather *improper use* of nuclear power being unsafe.
* Three Mile Island was overblown. People hear ""meltdown"" and think ""Chernobyl,"" when in reality it was pretty much a textbook case of how things like Chernobyl are handled when operators are actually trained. While some radioactive isotopes were released into the water, it was at levels that were completely ineffectual - enough to be detected, but not enough to actually do anything (most of the radioactive material, the fuel in particular, was sealed in by the failsafe procedures).
* Fukushima - Another example of the human element being the dangerous part. The Fukushima power plant was an outdated design of a *Midwestern American* plant designed to run on flowing water, which was then put in a country with the highest incidence of earthquakes in the world. Like their comrades in Chernobyl, the Fukushima administrators pretty much soaked a mattress in gasoline, put a lit candle on top, then used the mattress as a trampoline. Other nuclear plants - namely, those built to withstand the hazardous conditions of Japanese tectonics - have been historically sound in their safety measures."

wildweeds,personalfinance,1390030310.0,"Thanks so much for your advice.  I actually am looking for better jobs in the area I'm moving to in spring, and looking for ways to make myself more desirable in the meantime, like sprucing up my language skills.  

At the moment I don't have much to spare because I was laid off over the holiday season, and our first check back has not hit yet.  Once I start getting paid again I want to be very careful with where the money is going.  I am fortunate to work in a good kitchen that provides most of my meals, so my food and utilities are very cheap right now and I want to take advantage of that while I have it.  

I am hoping to get 1-2K back in taxes, which would help me pay off several small delinquencies from my transition (took a few months to get a job).  It would help me begin to pay off two mid-range bills (one 700 and one 1500), as well.  I am hoping to have these paid in full by the time my car is paid off or before.  Then I can divide the free money into savings or the loan.  

If I do not get much back in taxes, I will just work on paying the bills off snowball method, because I believe any bills under $500 should be handled first, then using the method you describe after that point should work very well.  

This is all in theory, though, reliant on my being able to get a job that pays more than I dole out in rent and other necessities.  Which is why I'm spending the time before my move improving my game.  I hope to transfer within my company and upgrade to a more appropriate position in the city once i get there.  "

It's also important for a jammer to understand that what works against rookie blockers is often different than what works against very experienced blockers. I can't draw the inside blocker to the outside and then cut in if she has the experience to know what I'm trying to do. "

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390031931.0,"Ah man, I think hands are like an extra sex organ. There is so much potential there. I like when a guy uses his hands in a really dominant way. I'm not really fond of when guys just rub their hands all over you. It's not very exciting unless it's done in an aggressive way. Hands should be used to show how much he is dying to have me.

While making out, I like it when a guy grabs my ass and/or rubs my pussy backwards toward my ass with long, firm strokes. During sex it can be slightly rough stuff like pulling my hair (very slightly though! it can hurt), putting his hands on my neck (I don't actually want to be choked but a firm hold can be really hot), putting his fingers in my mouth, pinning my arms down. I like for a guy to wrap his arms around me and hold me really close. For some reason I like a pressure down on my tummy in the area between my belly button and my pelvis. If you push that area during oral or while spoonfooking I get really turned on. 

In my experience guys are almost always too rough with their hands. You just don't realize how strong and uncoordinated your hands are...or maybe I just date guys with poor fine motor control. So even though I like things ""rough"" what I really mean is that I want him to psychologically dominate by being assertive about the way he touches me. I like it when the aggression is mixed in with some gentleness, like stroking my face. "

I was also dumb and unfortunate enough to have a weeaboo phase. One instance in particular stands out: I joined the school choir for art credit, despite having no talent for singing. I figured it would be fine because I wouldn't have to do any solos. Of fucking course the teacher assigns a project where we have to sing a song alone or in small groups to the class. I had no friends in the class because I was new to the school, so I had to do it alone. I chose a Japanese song from an anime.

RichardBehiel,science,1390032862.0,"&gt;  We have the ability to assess risk, and we also have the ability to gamble on that risk. 

There is nothing free about assessing risk.  Google's self-driving cars can access risk much better than humans can, at least in the set of risks that the car must take into consideration.  The set of risks that humans must take into consideration includes more than just driving, but it's still finite, and a far cry from the universal set of risks at that.  Point is, a sufficiently advanced robot could assess the same risks that we do, without any sort of free will.

Keep in mind that the mental part of you that you consider to be ""you"" is really just going along for the ride.  Your brain feeds ""you"" thoughts and emotions that arise from some extremely complex neurological process.  

Need proof?  Think of a thought without saying it to yourself in your head.  Surely if ""you"" really are the creator of the thought, you should still be able to think it while keeping it to ""yourself"".  Problem is, you're just the recipient of the thought that forms on its own in your brain, which is the result of countless chaotic external conditions and extremely too complicated to ever figure out mathematically without chunking it into various parts, but that's irrelevant.  

The bottom line is that *you cannot create a thought before you have it, and you can't have a thought before it your brain puts it together for you*.  There's an incredibly small delay at every step of the process which creates the illusion of continuity yet entirely separates the present moment from your perception of reality, never allowing your ""free will"" to step forward and proactively alter the course of events.

**""But wait, I can think of a random thought.  Isn't that free will?""**  No.  That's like asking a computer to return a random variable.  Just because you get something random back does not mean that the computer went and thought about it for a little while, and that the number was created by the computer's free will, devoid of all external influences.  All that happened was that instead of getting the information from some sort of structured process, the system went and got information from pseudorandom data like the fifth decimal place of the second of whatever time it was.

dianthe,politics,1390032918.0,"&gt;The fact that a ""best"" decision is completely subjective is EXACTLY why women should have the freedom to choose whether or not they abort. Imagine a world where women were forced to abort babies against their will. ""How terrible, how violating, how unjust!"" Yes. Women should have as much choice to terminate an unwanted pregnancy as they do to keep a wanted pregnancy. It's ""Freedom of Choice,"" and not ""Pro-Aborting Every Zygote Ever"" for a reason.

You were talking about ""best decisions"", and I'm saying that what makes you think it is ever the ""best decision""? If the woman changes her mind after seeing an ultrasound of her unborn it is still her mind to change and it could be the ""best decision"" for her. 

&gt;""We"" are the women who thought carefully through every option we had before ultimately making an informed, while sad, decision. And if there are women who become pregnant and aren't even concerned enough about it to educate themselves, or are so distraught that they can't bring themselves to read up on the matter, then perhaps they ought not be taking on something as traumatic as a pregnancy and unexpected, un-prepared for motherhood.

Again, you are talking about *YOU*. I have met many women who did change their minds after learning about prenatal development/seeing an ultrasound of their child. There is a comment in this very thread made by a woman who went through it. How can you disregard all of them and base everyone on YOU?

arichi,personalfinance,1390033180.0,"&gt; ideally I'd like to save up for those on my own and not touch this at all until retirement so I think that's what I'd like the goal for this account to be. 

My take:  yes and no.  This account can help you with those goals.  You've been given a pretty good helping hand to go forward with;  let's see what we can do to ensure you use it wisely.

&gt; All I've read about investing made me cringe when I saw those ERs.

Good.  Then you've been well-informed.

&gt; . I can have all these sent to a bank account instead of being re-invested? 

Yes.  If it's tax-advantaged - an IRA or similar - I suggest _against_ this, because that's a distribution from said account (don't take money out of tax-advantaged if you can help it).

&gt; Would I have to pay taxes on all that, or does that depend on the type of account this is?

If it's in tax-advantaged, there could be all sorts of penalties for taking it out.

If it's not in a tax-advantaged account, you're taxed on the distributions _no matter what you do with them_.  If you re-invest them, it's as if you used the proceeds to buy more of the same fund -- and if you don't like the fund, why do that?

&gt; . I can have all these sent to a bank account instead of being re-invested? Would I have to pay taxes on all that, or does that depend on the type of account this is?

Yep.  That may affect some things -- this could turn into your gold mine, or someone else's.  Let's get all the facts straight before we worry too much.

&gt; I really like the idea of having the cap gains and the dividends sent to my bank account and moving the funds into something with a lower ER. I like the 3-fund portfolio idea over at Bogleheads (I'm doing this with my IRA and 401K)

Cool.  I use a 3-fund portfolio myself (spread out across three IRAs, a taxable account, and employer plans).  

If it turns out your account is in taxable space, and if you're going to use the distributions towards retirement, I'll help you set up the necessary pieces to use a 3-fund portfolio (there's also /r/portfolios for exactly this sort of thing, and of course /r/personalfinance).  Let's find out just what the tax treatment is for your account before making plans for the money just yet though."

dianthe,politics,1390033329.0,"&gt;That is the opposite of education. That is indoctrination with misinformation based on your ""feeling"" over reality. A zygote is not a child. They are not the clueless ones.

Nobody aborts a ""zygote"", by the time abortion comes it is a fetus, so right now it is you who is doing the indoctrinating. And about the fetus being human.. well it is. The fetus might not be something everyone would consider a ""person"" as personhood is something very subjective and there are people who don't consider every other human a ""person"" but human is a species and a human fetus belongs to our species. When I was an unborn in my mother's uterus I was me - my looks, my intellect, predisposition to certain illnesses and to an extent even certain likes and dislikes were already pre-programmed. If time travel was possible and someone forced my mother to abort *me*, I would cease to exist even if my mother had other children with my father afterwards. My journey on this planet began when my unique DNA was combined out of my mother's and fathers and I began growing and developing, still doing that today. So no, teaching that a human fetus is a human in an early stage of development is biologically correct. 

&gt;The only thing I agree with you on is the need for education concerning protection.

Astraloid,GenderCritical,1390033773.0,"Here's a three-part twanslation:

&gt;     In deciding what I would write about this time around, I wrestled with so many
     possible themes: for instance, discussing how my views on this issue have evolved
     over the years; critiquing the masculine-centrism of modern-day dyke communities

Twanslation: Lesbians, stop acting like yourselves and start acting the way patriarchy tells you women to act.

&gt;     highlighting the need for heterogeneous queer spaces that are accepting of difference

Twanslation: Get rid of women's spaces

&gt;     explaining how trans male/masculine folks who claim a place in dyke spaces by 
    emphasizing their lack of male genitals or their assigned-female-at-birth status 
    royally screw over their trans sisters

twanslation: your sexual preferences &lt; my sexual needs

&gt;     or the misogyny inherent in the fact that the queer community loves it when
    trans female/feminine spectrum folks get all dragged up and lip sync along to some
    record

twanslation: Any display of femininity is trans, including drag queens who are actually trans males.

&gt;     but when we speak in our own voices about issues that are important to us, 
    nobody wants to take us seriously.

twanslation: In case you forgot how oppressed and silenced white men like me are, here's a reminder.

&gt;     While these are all worthy topics, I couldn‚Äôt make up my mind about what I
    most wanted to write about. So I decided to take a different approach. Instead 
    of figuring out what I most wanted to say, I asked myself: What do I most 
    want to hear? What topic would I most like to see addressed? 


twanslation: Er... Welcome to my personal echo chamber?


&gt;     And the answer to that question is easy: dating. Unfortunately for me, this 
    also happens to be the topic that I least want to publicly share my thoughts 
    about, in part because I like to keep some parts of my life relatively private, 
    and in part because I know some people will not like what I have to say. But
    I suppose that neither of these reasons has ever stopped me from speaking
    my mind before.

twanslation: I'm still hung up on male-centric ideas of sexual conquest and I'm failing at it.

&gt;     About two years ago, my ex and I split up after being together for nearly a decade.
    She was a cis queer woman who was supportive when I transitioned a few years into
    our relationship, and we were monogamous during the lion‚Äôs share of our time together. 
    This meant that for the first time in a decade, I would be re-entering the dating scene.
    This could be somewhat disconcerting for any person, but there were a few compounding
    factors that made it especially . . . well, let‚Äôs say ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù . . . for me. First, this
    would be the first time that I would be dating people as a woman.

twanslation:  All of my prior romantic experiences have been as a man. Apparently, I can point this out, but you can't because it's transphobic.

&gt;     Furthermore, while I had dated queer women before my transition, this would be my 
    first time formally dating within the queer women‚Äôs community. On top of that, around
    this same time, after years of identifying as a lesbian, I came out as bisexual, so I
    also planned on dating men.

twanslation: I consider my ability to get lesbians (and men, sort of) to be intimate with me an important indicator of the success of my transition and the realness of my womanhood.

&gt;     With regards to meeting queer women, it seems that traditionally much of this takes 
     place in dyke bars and clubs. While I am sometimes in such spaces, I don‚Äôt feel that 
     they are very conducive for me to meet potential romantic or sexual partners.

Astraloid,GenderCritical,1390033817.0,"&gt;     This is partly due to the fact that I am generally read as a cis woman. 

Twanslation: In dark, smoky lesbian bars I actually kind of pass.


&gt;     While I recognize this is a privilege, as it makes my life significantly easier 
    in many ways, it also means that any flirting, making out, or heavy petting I 
    engage in will eventually lead to a coming-out-as-trans moment,

Twanslation: Kissing girls gives me boners

&gt;     which often leaves me with an awful feeling in the pit of my stomach.

Twanslation: Which breaks the illusion for me.

&gt;     While you would think that cis dykes (being more trans aware than the
    public at large) would take such coming outs in stride, this is not actually 
    the case.

twanslation: Queer woman should have queer pride that an even queerer woman is interested in them, but for some reason they don't like my penis.

&gt;     Trans female friends of mine have had to suffer through cis dyke ‚Äúfreak out‚Äù
    moments, or even accusations of deception, that rival stereotypical reactions 
    of straight people.

Twanslation: Rejecting penis makes a lesbian like a straight person.
^(I think this is my favorite one)

&gt;     The second reason why the bar and club scene doesn‚Äôt work for me is that I fall 
    outside of the butch/femme binary, which is a central part of the San Francisco 
    Bay Area‚Äôs dyke dating scene

Twanslation: I'm too queer for San Francisco.

&gt;     While I identify as femme, I am not ‚Äúhigh femme‚Äù or ‚Äúsexy femme,‚Äù which are the
    only kinds of femme that seem to get read as legitimately femme in dyke spaces.

Twanslation: I act as femme-y as I can but I still look and act like a man.

&gt;     Several of my trans female friends have told me that cis dykes began to take way 
    more interest in them once they cut their hair short and began to dress more 
    androgynously.

Twanslation: Acting less like a tone-deaf parody of femininity makes trans males more approachable to women.

&gt;     While I don‚Äôt doubt that this is true, I have no desire to do this, as I am very 
    happy with my gender expression the way that it is, thank you very much.

Twanslation: But I'm going to act as campy and stereotypical as I please, even if it makes me unapproachable.

&gt;     One trans woman friend told me about how she recently met a cis dyke, and they
    were really hitting it off, until she realized that this person was misreading her for
    a person on the trans masculine spectrum. When my friend told the cis dyke that 
    she was in fact a trans woman, the cis dyke seemed to immediately lose interest.

twanslation: Hey trans (and butch) women? Another reminder to get your man hands off my potential lesbo babes.

&gt;     So, given all this, I figured that I would have better luck with personal ads, which 
    are often driven more by shared interests rather than appearance or dress, and in which
    I can disclose my trans status beforehand. On numerous occasions I have looked over
    the ‚Äúw4w‚Äù section of Craigslist, but it inevitably leaves me traumatized. There is so much
    trans hate speech on that site,

Twanslation: There are lesbians who reject non-op trans males outright! Can you believe that? They haven't even met me!

&gt;     and the very few ads that mention being open to trans are specifically looking for 
    trans men or tranny bois, not trans women.

Triplanetary,EnoughInternet,1390033824.0,Where's the uncensored version?
HaydenTheFox,funny,1390033827.0,"Calling it now: he's gonna wake up tomorrow and look at his comment history and be like ""Yeah that was too much LSD."""
Astraloid,GenderCritical,1390033831.0,"&gt;     I had heard decent things about OkCupid, so I figured I‚Äôd give it a try. I
    listed myself as bisexual, and at the end of my profile, I explicitly mentioned
    that I was a trans woman. I got a significant number of responses from 
    women as well as men. But in follow-up emails, it became clear that most of
    the women who responded hadn‚Äôt read my entire profile. At some point, once
    we started chatting, I would usually ask if they had ever dated a trans woman
    before (just to see what I was getting myself into), and suddenly‚Äîsurprise!
    ‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt hear from them again.

&gt;     So then I decided to try an experiment. I rearranged my profile to put the
    trans disclosure right at the top, and I changed my orientation from bisexual 
    to ‚Äúgay‚Äù (OkCupid‚Äôs category for exclusively same-sex) to ensure that I‚Äôd only
    receive replies from women. Over a four-month period, I received only five 
    responses: one from a cis bisexual woman, three from trans women, and one
    from a trans man. Now one possible explanation for this is that perhaps there
    are four times as many trans people on OkCupid than cis queer women. But a
    quick browsing of OkCupid listings will show that this is certainly not the case.
    Therefore, the inescapable conclusion is that while trans people and cis 
    bisexual women are often open to dating trans women, the overwhelming 
    majority of cis dykes are not.

Twanslation: WHY MUST YOU LESBIANS DENY ME YOUR SWEET C\*S DY\*E POONS? Stop being transphobic!

&gt;     While cis dykes have generally shown little interest in me, my experiences 
    with cis men have in comparison gone rather swimmingly. We have all heard 
    stories about how the only cis men interested in trans women are ‚Äútranny 
    chasers,‚Äù who are creepy, closeted, and who wouldn‚Äôt be caught dead being
    seen with an out trans woman in public. And certainly, those men do exist. But
    many of the cis men that I have met or chatted with on OkCupid and other sites
    do not fall into that stereotype. Lo and behold, some of them are even kind,
    intelligent, interesting, and fun to hang out with.

Twanslation: I know I opened this blog with a comment about lesbians acting too much like men, but really, you should be acting more like men. But just in the ways I want you to act like men. Like being more receptive to sex. With me. And my penis.

&gt;     When I asked the cis men who responded to my ad if they had ever dated a 
    trans woman before, they didn‚Äôt disappear like the cis dykes usually did. Instead, 
    most of them gave thoughtful answers. Some said that they found trans women 
    more interesting, open-minded, and/or courageous than the average cis woman. 
    Others said they had honestly not considered dating a trans woman before, but 
    they really liked my profile, and they considered themselves to be queer-positive,
    so they didn‚Äôt consider my transness to be a big deal. Still others put it quite simply:
    They are attracted to women, and while most of their past partners were cis women,
    a few were trans women, and it really makes no difference to them.

Twanslation: See? Men know how awesome trans males are, why don't you dy*es?

&gt;     When cis men tell me these things, it honestly makes me a little sad. I mourn
    the fact that I have not heard similar sentiments from my own cis queer women‚Äôs
    community. I also find it ironic that cis dykes‚Äîmany of whom pride themselves
    on their progressive politics and subversive sexualities‚Äîtend to be far more
    conservative and conforming to our culture‚Äôs yuck-dating-a-trans-woman-is-gross
    mindset than their cis male counterparts, at least here in the San Francisco Bay Area.
    I am also embarrassed as a queer for the fact that so many straight cis men have
    worked through, or are beginning to work through, their own issues regarding trans
    women, whereas most cis queer women refuse to even consider the possibility that
    they even have an issue.

Twanslation: This is how I neg. I am a pro at negging women.

&gt;     I know first-hand that it can be difficult to confront such issues. I remember a time
    many years ago‚ÄîI was either just about to transition, or I had just transitioned, I 
    can‚Äôt quite recall‚Äîwhen I saw a short documentary about two trans women who were
    life partners. And I am horribly embarrassed to say that, at the time, I was somewhat
    squicked by their relationship. The irrationality of my reaction was not lost on me. 
    After all, I am a trans woman. And I am also attracted to women. So what was it about
    the idea of being with a trans woman that bothered me so? Over time, I realized that 
    on an unconscious level, I was still buying into the idea that trans women were somehow
    unattractive, defective, and illegitimate, and that being partnered to a cis woman was
    somehow inherently better, or more authentic. After much personal reflection, I had to 
    admit that my reaction was profoundly anti-trans. And I eventually got over my
    internalized transphobia, just as I had to get over my internalized homophobia the first
    time I sexually experimented with a man, and just as I had to overcome my own fatphobia
    the first time I dated a differently-sized woman.

twanslation: I am hypothetically ok with dating trans males so you should be too, even if I completely ignored all the trans people who messaged me on OKcupid.

&gt;     Sexual attraction is a complex phenomenon, and of course there is lots of individual
    variation. I certainly do not expect every cis queer woman to swoon over me. And if it
    were only a small percentage of cis dykes who were not interested in trans women at all,
    I would write it off as simply a matter of personal preference.

Twanslation: What is lesbianism I don't even

&gt;     But this not a minor problem‚Äîit is systemic; it is a predominant sentiment in queer
    women‚Äôs communities. And when the overwhelming majority of cis dykes date and fuck
    cis women, but are not open to, or are even turned off by, the idea of dating or fucking
    trans women, how is that not transphobic? And to those cis women who claim a dyke
    identity, yet consider trans men, but not trans women, to be a part of your dating pool,
    let me ask you this: How are you not a hypocrite? 

Twanslation: It's ok for *me* to limit myself to faab people, but if *you* do it, you're an illogical bigoted dy\*e.

&gt;     I did not write this piece to vent about my dating life. I go out on plenty of dates, and
    I‚Äôm having lots of super-fucking-awesome sex, just not with cis women at the moment.

Twanslation: So the sexual desperation and chauvinistic undertones seeping through this entire blog are only in your head.

&gt;     My purpose in writing this piece is to highlight how cis dykes‚Äô unwillingness to
    consider trans women as legitimate partners translates directly into a lack of
    community for queer-identified trans women.

twanslation: Trans males like me can't be real lesbians until you start sleeping with us, so spread 'em!

&gt;     After all, queer women‚Äôs communities serve several purposes. They are places where
    we can build alliances to fight for our rights. They are places where we can find friendship
    and chosen family. But one of the most critical functions that queer women‚Äôs communities
    serve is in providing a safe space outside of the heterocentric mainstream where women
    can express interest, attraction, and affection toward other women. In other words, queer
    women‚Äôs spaces fulfill our need for sexual validation.

Twanslation: The purpose of queer women's spaces is so that people like me can receive sexual validation.

&gt;     Unless, of course, you are a trans woman. And personally, with each passing year, it 
    becomes harder and harder for me to continue to take part in a community in which I 
    am not seen as a legitimate object of desire.

noc007,AskReddit,1390033856.0,"**Gays and Gay Marriage**

**Background:**

I was raised in a Christian home and went to Christian schools for about half of my grade school education. I was taught the typical bullshit about gay sex being an abomination, it's sin, and I shouldn't associate myself with them. I wasn't WBC spitting hate, but I wasn't ok with it. I believed that marriage was between a man and a woman and anything else should be outlawed. I maintained this line of thinking for a long time sadly. I met some gay people along the way, but kept my opinions to myself as I didn't think it was polite nor did I see a need. I did try to not treat them any differently; if I ever said anything offensive, they didn't show that they noticed it.

**My Opinion Now:**

I was taught and still maintain the belief that everyone is a sinner, all our sin is equal in the eyes of God, I am not better than anyone else, I cannot judge others until I am fully judged first (law of the land still applies), a person's sin is between them and God as well as the person they sinned against if applicable, and Jesus commanded us to love one another as we love Him (part of that includes not being a dick). How could I call myself a Christian if I hated or harmed someone for any reason? I was also taught that ""Christian"" means ""Christ-like""; I am not even remotely close to being like Jesus and because of that I don't think I am a Christian (I do say my religion is Christianity and I try to be a Christian) and don't consider myself a good person.

An opinion I have that would shock some I know is I believe it's perfectly possible for a gay person to be part of the Christian faith. I don't see being gay as sinful based on what I've learned; the lust and acting on it is the sin. I can't speak for God so I don't know if this opinion is correct or not, but I think it is based on what I've learned. I reconnected with a friend from HS and it turns out that in addition to still being a Messianic Jew, he's also gay; part of me was surprised and the other part wasn't. He's a cool guy and infectious with joy. One day I'm going to encounter the right uptight, super conservative homophobe and enjoy watching his head explode as I tell him about one of my friends.

Before my inbox is flooded with outrage, please read the next section after this part. I see what we have today as a civil rights issue. The tax and legal benefits I have as someone in a union with the opposite sex should extend a couple of the same sex. It is my *opinion* that marriage is defined as a union between a man and a woman. Additionally, I believe marriage is an institution of the church and therefore doesn't belong in the government and the legal system. I would *prefer* the government and legal system use a different word or phrase like ""Civil Union"" or ""Domestic Partnership"". If people want to call a gay union ""marriage"", I'm happy to agree to disagree on the definition and am fine to not express a silly opinion. If a church or other entity recognizes gay marriage, their opinion is different than mine, it doesn't affect me, and I'm no bothered by it.

I am a firm believer in the separation of church and state. Seriously, they need to be separate and there was a good reason the US was founded on this. ""In God we trust"" needs to be removed and ""E Pluribus Unum"" needs to go back; that includes the currency and the stuff on my license plate. ""Under God"" needs to be removed from the ""Pledge of Allegiance"" and frankly I'm fine if we stopped doing that damn thing that was started to sell flags to schools for a tidy profit anyways. And FFS, don't put the 10 Commandments at any government facility; they're going to have to have stuff from other religions next to it as well so stop being an asshole.

More people need to watch Louis C.K. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d63ClccjjE http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb-JZSyhWSc

**Why My Opinion Doesn't Matter:**

The definition of marriage doesn't negatively affect me or my family. Definitions change over time; just look at the definition of ""gay"". My opinion on the definition of marriage IMHO matters as much as someone's favorite color; who the fuck cares. If someone wants to know, I can tell them, but beyond that I'll keep it to myself as it's just not that important. What's at issue is civil rights. They should enjoy the benefits that a heterosexual couple have. We shouldn't be assholes to each other.

**Lesbians and the Bible:**

When referencing ""gay"" in the above text, I am including lesbians as well. What I've found interesting in reading the Bible is I haven't found anything referencing a sexual relationship between two women as sin. I'd be interested to know if I missed it and what the passage is. I have read in the Bible about two men having intercourse together as sin; just women has so far escaped me. I think it would be a conundrum for a theologian to answer if the Bible doesn't actually cover it.

**TL;DR** I use to be against gay marriage. Today I would make it a point to go and vote in favor of it and I live in the South. I try to not be a dick. More people need to watch Louis C.K. I haven't found where lesbians are covered in the Bible yet and I'd like to know.

Apparently my brother had seen the same and screamed too, and was talking to my mom while I was talking to my dad. Our stories added up, and we went downstairs to turn on the local news because of sirens all around us. Our back neighbor got hit by ball lightning that entered through the roof, and then the remaining energy somehow got out and hit their neighbor across from the street.

Only way my parents could get me back to sleep was by telling me lightning never strikes twice in the same place. Been fascinated with lightning since then. And never saw ball lightning since."

endymion2300,AskReddit,1390034286.0,"this happened to me when i was a kid. 

my parents had a contractor working on our house. he had set up a work spot in the driveway. somewhere in there he unplugged some power tool and tossed the extension cord behind him into the grass. he went inside, and i went to pick up the cord and give it to him. i grabbed the socket end of the cord and got shocked. my hand clamped down around the socket and my whole upper body felt like it was on fire. 

i don't know how long i was standing there; it felt like forever, but could've been a few seconds. 

the guy ran outta the house and yanked on the extension cord hard enough to pull the end out of my hand. i fell down and sat there for a bit. i remember he kept asking if i was okay. once i stood up, he told me not to tell my parents. 

i never did. i was only five or six; i thought i'd get in trouble.

Just last year my parents had to move out. They got foreclosed on and lost the house they had been in the last 25 years. They still blame 'the corrupt legal system' and not the fact that they stopped paying all their debts and hoped everything would just go away.

After the court case they sent out 'invoices' to every judge and lawyer involved stating that because they violated personal rights, they owe vast amounts silver. Then they listed every 'violation' with a note beside it saying things like, ""Required my attendance in court without a contract. 2000 oz silver""

So now they are living without a home waiting for the millions of ounces of silver that are owed to them, thinking of themselves as victims.

I'm kind of over it now, and moved 11000 kilometers away from them, but I spent *years* arguing with them about how retarded the whole thing was, and how none of it has any basis in *anything*.

For reference, my Dad believes that vaccines cause autism, that we never landed on the moon, that the American government caused 9/11, that some guy in Egypt has already perfected perpetual motion using pyramids and magnets, that it's possible to power a fuel cell with an alternator to produce enough fuel to run the alternator (And the car).

finalDraft_v012,drawing,1390034902.0,"I also have crappy depth perception; I have severe astigmatism that an ophthalmologist has said cannot be corrected with glasses.  But I also love to draw.  I do not notice anything weird in life unless I start bumping in to things, haha...because this is the kind of eyesight that I've known for my whole life.

Take the notion that you have bad depth perception and **completely ignore it**.  It doesn't have much to do with your ability to observe things - the way light falls on to an object, the way darkness casts itself over and object.  You still see values just like any other human!  I have not ever felt a detriment to my low depth perception.  I do, however, feel it when driving - parallel parking in particular is a huge bitch when you can't tell how far or close you are to anything.  But I practiced hard on that and figured out visual cues that help me logically reason out my body's location. As a kid, because of my bad depth perception I constantly had bruises on my hips, legs, etc. cuz I would bump in to things that I thought were farther away from myself.

It sounds to me that you are taking the fact that you have low depth perception to heart way too much.  Like the old Nike slogan, just do it - it is still all about practice.  Because you're not in motion, I have not found that drawing is affected adversely in any way by low depth perception.

I often draw using photos as reference, but still gain a lot from drawing from life.  Things are more vibrant.  Things still have slightly more volume than a photo, and that can often show in what you produce.

dianthe,politics,1390034993.0,"&gt;I was exaggerating by calling it a zygote. I should not have given you that opening for a semantic argument. Sadly, yet again you are incorrect. A fetus is only termed that after the 9th week after fertilization, or the 11th week of gestation. As it generally takes 3-4 weeks for a woman to know she is pregnant at best, plenty of abortions occur before the ""human"" as you call it is actually a fetus. Semantics are fun.

I can read Wikipedia too. The very next line after that though says: ""In biological terms, however, prenatal development is a continuum, with no clear defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus."". So the 11 week distinction is purely there to make defining things more simple, not because it is a biological truth. And it is still not a zygote because a zygote is a single sell. 

&gt;If your journey on this planet had been interrupted by an abortion, you would be none the wiser, as you would cease to exist.

So does that make killing babies ok? Humans don't develop self-awareness until 2-3 years old I believe. 

Have you ever heard of a philosopher named Don Marquis? His argument states that the reason abortion is immoral is the same reason killing someone is immoral and that is because it deprives that human being of their future. In the case of a fetus they have a very similar type of future to a person who has already been born, which is valuable, much like ours.


Here is a quote from Marquis' paper:


""The loss of one's life is one of the greatest losses one can suffer. The loss of one's life deprives one of all the experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments that would otherwise have constituted one's future. Therefore, killing someone is wrong, primarily because the killing inflicts (one of) the greatest possible losses on the victim. To describe this as the loss of life can be misleading, however. The change in my biological state does not by itself make killing me wrong. The effect of the loss of my biological life is the loss to me of all those activities, projects, experiences, and enjoyments which would otherwise have constituted my future personal life. These activities, projects, experiences, and enjoyments are either valuable for their own sakes or are means to something else that is valuable for its own sake. Some parts of my future are not valued by me now, but will come to be valued by me as I grow older and as my values and capacities change. When I am killed, I am deprived both of what I now value which would have been part of my future personal life, but also what I would come to value. Therefore, when I die, I am deprived of all of the value of my future. Inflicting this loss on me is ultimately what makes killing me wrong. This being the case, it would seem that what makes killing any adult human being prima facie seriously wrong is the loss of his or her future."" (pp. 189-90) Marquis, Don. ""Why Abortion is Immoral."" The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 86, No. 4 (Apr., 1989)

So yes while I would be none the wiser, as I would cease to exist if I was aborted I would still be robbed of my future. I mean if any of us were to be killed we wouldn't really care about it since, you know, we'd be dead, but killing someone is still considered immoral and one of the reasons for it is because it robs them of their future. That is why in our society we are generally more sad about a young person dying than an old person dying."

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390035186.0,"Ramona Quimby from the Beverly Cleary books. I recently reread a couple of them for nostalgia's sake and I actually cried multiple times. Something about her I really relate to. 

Chibimaruko (aka Chibimarukochan) from the Japanese cartoon series. (I grew up watching it because I'm from Japan.) She has a very charming mix of earnestness and goofiness. Totally takes herself seriously and not seriously at the same time. I don't feel that Japanese culture is that supportive of girls but I felt like by being like Chibimaruko I could be myself and be accepted. I think it shaped how I relate to my father because I will forever be his little goofball. 

I really liked Lamb Chop for similar reasons. She was sweet and also funny. I think I've always found my niche by being something of a comedian, so I appreciate that in people. Her humor was about bearing her emotions and insecurities, which is similar to Chibimaruko's humor. 

I loved Matilda. The book was better than the movie, but I liked both. And I adored Ms Honey. 

In 3rd-5th grade I really liked Amelia from the Amelia's notebook series. She was thoughtful and creative. 

In 5th-6th grade I really looked up to that one girl from the show Even Stevens. Her name was Ren or something like that. I think I mostly liked her because she was pretty and cool - really shallow reasons I guess. 

Nothing really comes to mind for middle and high school, come to think of it. I'll have to think about that. 

This is somewhat off-topic but in college I watched An Education, and I related so strongly to the young protagonist. It really hit a lot of spots with regard to my teenage angst and sexual awakening.

Go to JohnK Stuff and look at everything he posts about color - he's the guy who created Ren and Stimpy - he has so many great theories and down-to-earth descriptions of how to use neutral colors.    
You can take the curse off Pink/Purple combinations by mixing grays into the piece, and off Yellow/Brown by mixing into orange instead of ochre ranges. I don't know how to fix that fashionable magenta/cyan combo, ugly as it looks...   
The artists you desperately need to check out are N. C. Wyeth and Erich Sokol - Frank Frazetta's colors don't get enough study. Gods among men.   
And if you're painting, then buy several primary colors, so you can mix more subtle secondaries. (I recommend having at the least a lemon yellow, medium yellow, and gold ochre; a scarlet, a crimson, and a brilliant red of your choice, perhaps a magenta; and a phthalo, ultramarine, cerulean blue, and indigo, perhaps indianthrone.

w00ten,hardware,1390036218.0,"This is a really hard question to answer.

Part of me(the Athlon 64 fan boy part) wants to say that Intel will hit a physical limitation on transistor size(about 2-3nm if you include slip-hair transistors). This barrier would give AMD time to catch up. It could even allow them to surpass Intel because Intel still can't match AMD on memory access times. Sadly, I don't think this will happen soon enough, and it is reasonable to think that there is enough time for Intel to find a solution to this before it actually happens.

Another part of me(the intelligent part) says that AMD is doomed. Microsoft adding ARM support to Windows is HUGE and will(you could say it already did) completely change the processor market. We've seen massive jumps in both processing power and power efficiency in ARM processors and these things are only going to get better. It is even reasonable to think that we may see another architecture war like we saw in the late 80's and early 90's with PowerPC and x86.

I honestly don't know the answer, but AMD is going to have to do something or they will not survive, especially with ARM chips being poised to enter the desktop and laptop market as processing power on ARM chips increases. I just don't know how much longer they can use their server chips as a crutch to support the rest of the business."

gualdhar,AdviceAnimals,1390036363.0,"There's no evidence vegan diets for dogs have any adverse effects, including shorter life span.

*A plant* not *all plants.* Again, proteins are made of amino acids. While meat and animal products contain most, if not all, proteins the body would need (including non-essential ones), the right combination of vegan-friendly foods will give you all the essential amino acids a human, or dog, needs to be healthy. Sure, any given plant product won't have all the essential amino acids, but again, vegan diets rely on a blend of multiple ~~plant proteins~~ *protein-rich plant products* for healthy living. Whether for a human or a dog, a vegan diet has to be carefully planned (or buy the appropriate kibble).

There is no nutrient required for a dog's good health that cannot be found in plant products or easily obtained from a vegan-appropriate supplement (yes, dogs can take vitamins too).

Now, I have never, nor will I, claim that a normal dog without food allergies *should* be on a vegan diet. It's up to the owner to know what the hell he's doing, and I bet if someone reputable just said ""dogs should be vegans"" then some the owners that would take that to heart would carry it out in a very unhealthy way. My own dogs (I've had three total) have never been on vegan diets, and I probably wouldn't switch them to vegan diets unless it was necessary. That doesn't mean it's impossible, stupid, or anything other word you'd use to disagree.

Buscat,Games,1390036436.0,"Well compare games to movies. With a movie the most you could possibly waste on it is like 2 hours of your time and 15 bucks.

With games, you are presented with an opportunity to sink massive amounts of time into them. Games with multiplayer or other highly repeatable activities can represent hundreds of hours of sunk time (or in the case of WoW for me, thousands -_-). This can lead to heightened promises and expectations of what a game can and should provide. This presents a lot of room for hype, because the sky is seen as the limit.

Gamers are also a critical lot because of the interactivity of the medium. With a movie you sit there and you might say, well I didn't quite get it. It didn't grab me. It's easier to give it the benefit of the doubt. With a game, you're in there. You're in control. You played an active part in your experience, and if you don't enjoy it, you feel sort of cheated.

ebonlance,Warmachine,1390036553.0,"I hate it. It seems randomly thrown together. Aurora is an assassination caster with a side of infantry support, she doesn't like spending half her points on warjacks, and 2/3rds of those points going to a jack that can't even use her incredible field marshall ability.

Not to mention only taking one unit of angels is borderline criminal. I want to stop critiquing this list and arrange your trial in the Hague. My advice would be to play some 25pt and 35pt games with her until you get a feel for how she operates before you spend any money on this horrific frankenstein of a list.

A more reasonable 50pt Aurora list might look something like:

Aurora, Numen of Aerogensis (*6pts)

* Cipher (9pts)

* Inverter (8pts)

Clockwork Angels (Leader and 2 Grunts) (3pts)

Clockwork Angels (Leader and 2 Grunts) (3pts)

Clockwork Angels (Leader and 2 Grunts) (3pts)

Obstructors (Leader and 9 Grunts) (6pts)

Reciporactors (Leader and 4 Grunts) (9pts)

Enigma Foundry (3pts)

Enigma Foundry (3pts)

Transinfinite Emergence Projector &amp; Permutation Servitors (9pts)

This gives you a shitload of infantry that can actually make good use of transference (boosting a CMA charge it make sure it sticks is a very good use of it), and obscene methods of holding objectives thanks to shield wallers that get healed and/or come back. The battle engine is at times unkillable. Admonition on an Inverter after you've used it to scrap a heavy can be just plain mean. 

All in all though, your main goal is to annoy your opponent into overextending and punishing him or her with the righteous fucking bullshit that is flank-fueled Aurora if you can clear a path for even a single angel to run in on an enemy warcaster (or abuse her feat to get them a non-free-striking advance), Aurora will finish the job in spectacular form. There are few targets that can stand up to 8 MAT8 PS12+3d6 attacks, or 4 MAT8 PS12+4d6 attacks excepting some of the really high-ARM casters overboosting. Aurora threat range is a special kind of bullshit too, as a 14 inch flight bubble (and Aurora sitting at arm 22 with all her focus up) means there aren't a lot of things who can smack her down in one shot.

It is not foolish to sit down and really think about what makes an unborn and a newborn different in our eyes as both lack self-awareness. It is also not foolish to ponder why we consider the taking of human life immoral at all. If the death is quick and painless without the person even realizing what is happening, why is it immoral to kill them? Why does human life have value? Does it have any value at all?

ebonlance,Warmachine,1390037245.0,"&gt;Anti-assassination caster
 
While some targets are harder than others, the best way to avoid an assassination is to be an anti-assassination player instead of bringing a specific model.

&gt;Soulless or a way to counter soul collecting

Going out of your way to handle this when it's only relevant for a few lists is kind of silly. 

&gt;Ranged and melee

Nominally perhaps but favoring one over the other isn't the end of the world. eLylyth comes to mind as a 'lock who doesn't really need to worry too much about melee as if anything survives the initial volley that can't be taken down with piddly Ravagore claws you're boned anyway.

&gt;Magical weapons

Really, a way to deal with incorporeal models that doesn't revolve around them attacking first. If you have magical ranged to get around Hymn of Passage, yay.

&gt;Anti stealth

Or at least ways to mitigate it.

I don't think you can come up with a list of absolutes to come prepared for literally every eventuality and hard-counter everything an opponent could being. My checklist for competitive lists involves dealing with extreme skews:

- What is my plan for dealing with ridiculous DEF models like IF Kayazy?

- What is my plan for dealing with very durable models like AS Stormwall?

- What is my plan for mitigating the risk from common assassination tricks? (Flight models, MHSF gambits, Eiryss) 

- How can I hold objectives, and if I can't hold them well how can I clear them quickly or get there first. 

- What's my gameplan for dealing with common threats in the metagame?

- How do I deal with putative, absolutely crazy skew lists I might not have seen before? (Troll gunlines, 8-zerker Karchev)

- What is my contingency if my initial strategy fails?"

Astraloid,CriticalGender,1390037717.0,"siiiiiigh. I should probably answer your question for real.

Viviphilia, 'transracial' people have existed largely for the same reason transgender people exist. For example, people in the states have 'transitioned' from black to white, or white to black, in order to escape slavery (pre-antebellum) or discrimination (post-antebellum), to fit in better with a particular social group, to fight against discrimination, or to simplify a complex ancestry. The patterns for 
'ethnic bending', for lack of a more tactful phrase, significantly predate contemporary hyperindividualistic ideas about gender identity, so they don't have the 'trans' prefix, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ellen_Pleasant) one example:

&gt;After the war, she publicly changed her racial designation in the City Directory from 'White' to 'Black', causing a little stir among some whites. She began a series of court battles to fight laws prohibiting blacks from riding trolleys and other such abuses. She usually prevailed.

Racial misidentification was also forcibly applied to certain 'invalid' children, especially if not exclusively white children, much as gender reassignment is forced upon (mostly male) non-conforming children today. Children with developmental disabilities were sometimes considered 'mongoloid', with the reasoning being that the facial characteristics of the children suggested that one of the mothers ancestors had been raped by an Asian person.

So that's where. Don't assume because your specific terminology doesn't show up in the box you decided to check that something has never happened."

Here's the [Hayabusa shinkansen service](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOfhETPbza0) from Tokyo to Shin-Aomori. Here's the inside of the trains [Grand Class](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOfhETPbza0).

Even though that goes 320Kmh, that's not fast enough... like at all.

Trains must go faster.  So here's the Mag-Leg test track that is going to be a part of the Chuo (main) Shinkansen. The train goes at about 311MpH. Can you imagine that going from, say... Richmond Virginia &lt;---&gt; Boston MA? That'd take just a little over an hour... 

You can turn DC into a hub, just like Tokyo, and extend the line further south towards Raleigh, Charlotte and Atlanta. There could be a service that splits from DC and cuts straight down to Florida. It would take you maybe 9 hours to go from NYC down to Florida, so perhaps its not best for *long distance travel*.

But for everything in between? 
It'd be great!

And remember, you said *highway* not *airplane* so don't throw that around. Also consider things like early check-in, security, safety, signing in, *coach*. Airplanes and Shinkansen are actually very *very* competitive against each other when it comes to medium-distance travel (~100-300 mi)"

2) Whenever I need it and have it. I don't care what time it is. I don't smoke before work because I don't actually have an MMJ card. If I could smoke before work, I'd never miss a day.

3) I usually smoke joints as I have to smoke outside and live in a residential neighbourhood so bongs and pipes are a little conspicuous. If you are in the same situation as me but find things too harsh and the coughing becomes a problem for your pants, try adding some menthol tobacco to the joint/bowl to smooth it out. Not advocating smoking cigarettes, but it really helps when you add a bit of menthol to the pot. I don't care for edibles, especially when I'm flaring because nobody wants to puke up their pot. Also, no appetite. I've never heard of injecting THC or CBD but I'm sure it's possible when processed the right way. If it is, don't do it, there are FAR better ways.

4) I prefer Indica for during the day. Favorite strains are just about any kind of Kush but my favorite is Purple Kush. It is a good mix of medicinal benefit, while remaining functional. Strong sativa's are good for night time when you want to sleep. They take the edge off the pain and burn you out pretty hard. Purple Power Plant is generally my favorite that is accessible, my favorite is Buddha. Sometimes some Purple Haze comes around, but I buy that as much for medicinal as I do to get fucked up because that shit will knock you on your ass. Wicked for sleeping. I call it couch weed because all you can do is sit there or sleep.

Spikemaw,MensRights,1390038087.0,"The worst part of it is the attitude that women's sexuality is meant to be freed and is empowering, while men's sexuality is ""dangerous"" and to be controlled, monitored and shamed. 

I realize that this isn't universal, but the use of porn and sex toys seems like one of the most glaring and common hypocrisies. There are plenty of ""feminists"" that own small collections of sex toys, read erotic fiction, and speak out against ""slut shaming,"" but none of that stops them from thinking (and saying) ""ew"" at the idea of a man viewing porn or using a sex toy. This really comes down to the complete societal reversal. Once, men were sexually free and women's sexuality was ""dangerous"" and to be watched and controlled, shamed. To be fair, men and women both controlled and monitored each other's sexuality, because of the dictates of monogamy, lack of birth control, and religion. Now that women have complete control of their own sexuality and have rebuffed male control, they are still slow to give up their control of male sexuality.

The other, more worrying, common thing is around males and children. The focus on men as rapists and murderers has become fever-pitched. The fear is incredible, and powerful. Men almost have to carry around their children's birth certificates to prove their parenthood. Men can't stop for a rest at a playground while jogging without being harassed by fearful, bigoted, women (and unfortunately men, too). The problem lies in the portrayal of men as prime abusers, not women. And it's bullshit. Women abuse children A LOT. They're just not caught or prosecuted so often, and that is getting worse as the focus on men has intensified (Why question that female childcare worker, only men can rape, right? She just loves the children!)."

Fairly Rare. You can't just have people digging a few holes and finding large amounts of it everywhere they look.

Non-reactive. You don't want your currency to dissolve in water, rust,  react with another element and become destroyed, etc. You also don't want it to be dangerous or poison. Gold is good for this. Silver is too, but it tarnishes.

Distinctive. Fool's gold aside, not many things can be mistaken for Gold.

citadel_lewis,DebateReligion,1390039186.0,"&gt;Specifically, holding theism as an organic cultural development sufficiently explains all observed religious phenomena. The universe doesn't resemble a work of any meaningful* deity, and so a great deal of confidence in atheism is justified.

I find that inconsistent. If you're a hard enough skeptic to allow for the possibility that your own mind doesn't exist, that it is a false construct, then isn't it absurd to say that the only time there isn't that possibility is when your mind is analyzing religion? 

After all, your sense of self is sufficiently explained by the possibility that you do, indeed, have a mind that is controlled and experienced exclusively by you. A skepticism so extreme seems to be inconsistent when empirical data is used to gain knowledge in one instance, but in the other it is denied as insufficient. 

Solipsism, and the extreme version being discussed here, are based on empirical skepticism *across the board*.

&gt;a deity indistinguishable from uniform natural processes is meaningless

Meaning is entirely subjective. If you don't ascribe meaning to something, it is meaningless. If you do, it has meaning. A deity that is manifested as uniform natural processes will be ascribed meaning, without doubt, and this is confirmed by most pagan religions."

I was born here. My dad lived in PB for most of my childhood. (Regretfully, I was living with my mother and grandparents in San Bernardino for most of my childhood... Guess who *really* got screwed in that divorce settlement?) I still call it The Murph instead of The Q. 

And I literally attended my first Chargers game 2 months before I was born. September 23, 1973 in the home opener against the Bills. We won the game, but we didn't do anything else that year with a final record of 2-11-1. (Tie was against the Browns.) The ticket stub was somewhere in my share of Mom's effects, until my half-brother burned them after the funeral. (He's still pissed that I told a funny story at our mother's funeral.

OPCA arguments are never sold to their customers as simple ideas, but instead are byzantine schemes which more closely resemble the plot of a dark fantasy novel than anything else. Latin maxims and powerful sounding language are often used. Documents are often ornamented with many strange marking and seals. Litigants engage in peculiar, ritual‚Äëlike in court conduct. All these features appear necessary for gurus to market OPCA schemes to their often desperate, ill‚Äëinformed, mentally disturbed, or legally abusive customers. This is crucial to understand the non-substance of any OPCA concept or strategy.

* Work on your skills. Your work is decent, but decent and without much character. Work harder and push yourself further beyond what you've done so far. It might help to get an old textbook about drawing or art history to help you work on your range of skills. 

* Draw every day and draw something new at least once a day, even if it only stays in sketch form. Practice with that tablet as much as possible.

* Don't quit your day job until work is steady and takes more time than your job will allow. There is absolutely no shame in working at Walmart if it means you can spend some of your free time promoting yourself and practicing.

* Look for free tutorials about drawing both on paper and on your tablet. The web is filled with free resources that you can use to improve yourself.

I'll be completely honest with you. I wouldn't commission you. Your drawings look like they were done on old MS paint and are just on the verge of being good. However, that doesn't mean there's nothing here that can be salvaged or improved.

If the black person is in America it is more than likely his ancestors being slaves is most significantly caused by a white person. It isn't racism. Its just the truth.

As you have already said, there is no moral imperative to physical attraction or personal intimacy. But also, the ""beauty argument"" implies that there is a ""flaw"" among short men that is innate to being short. That is, by maintaining that the ""dating problem"" is universal (existing across time and culture), you're supporting a naturalistic argument which is incompatible with a heightism model because it undercuts the idea that these phenomena are evidence of a social construct. In other words, it can lend support to the idea that short stature is an intrinsic negative instead of a social one. Additionally, this dating analysis is often used to exaggerate the differences between men and women while implying that women hold a monopoly on this type of social bigotry. This idea, and those which extends from it, are bad for short men and women alike. A social prejudice which is thought to be exercised by only one gender does not a serious social prejudice make.  "

dercsalvo,AskWomen,1390040634.0,"I'm with you /u/OreCal (and /u/riseandrise below)! To answer your question, at least from my opinion, is that once a couple are living together, there is no mystery left in the relationship. By that point, you're most likely actively having sex, see each other every day or close to that. You're pretty much already married. It's just not legally binding yet. So why even bother getting married? For the tax benefits? Meh. My theory is, if you love the person enough and really do mean to spend the rest of your life together, then I don't really need to live with you before hand. We'll figure that out when we get there. Let that be something we figure out together, as one. I used to feel the same way about sex, but that failed (curse you adolescent hormones!)

Another point is that I think a major part of a successful relationship is compromise. You'll never find the perfect partner, there will always be something. So instead of concentrating on every little detail, why not look for the major components and then work on compromise for the rest of it. 

Now, marriage is indeed a big step and (supposed to be) permanent, so I have compromised with myself that moving in after getting engaged does make sense. I figure by that point, we've known each other long enough and marriage really is the next step, which we have both acknowledged, so there is very little difference in my opinion at that point.

Hope that helps a little bit."

SirJefferE,AskReddit,1390040736.0,"I was driving along an icy back road in Northern Canada, not really going too fast but it was my first time on the road so it was unfamiliar to me. The road opens up at a T intersection with a highway up ahead, so I start to brake a few hundred feet before the stop sign.

...And nothing happens. So I'm sliding, and sliding, and sliding, and sliding, and thinking, ""Damn, I'm not going to even come close to stopping before the highway.""

I continued trying to stop for a few seconds, realized it just wasn't happening, and saw a Semi coming from one side. I wasn't going to be able to stop, he *definitely* wasn't going to be able to stop, and if I continued trying to stop we were both going to have a bad time. Me significantly more than him.

So I let go of the brakes, made as wide of a turn as I could onto the highway without sliding off any roads (flipping wasn't really a concern, I really wasn't going fast), and then gunned it so I could get up to a fast enough speed that the semi who was by then braking wasn't going to hit me.

I never actually thought ""I'm not getting out of this alive"" because the whole thing took maybe ten seconds tops, but looking back on it there's a pretty good chance I'd have died if I tried literally anything else.

A truck decided to pull past me at 160km/h, then stop in front of me, then came out screaming asking me what the hell I was trying to do. Then he hit me in the face, got back in his truck, reported me to my boss and got me fired from my job, so it wasn't *entirely* a good day, but I didn't die so there is that."

My personal opinion is that she accidentally forgot to pay the fine because of all the paper work on her table, this is no excuse but a probable assumption. Talk to her about the contempt charge on your record and request (demand) that she work to remove the charge as compensation for her inadequate services. If she says yes, get it on paper, and once its gone from your records just let it go. Pro bono is more used when a attorney is doing a case out of pity which is not your case.

Is the person already an equipped brewer or wine maker, trying their hand at mead? Or are they completely new, working with only common kitchenware?

That's why you see some beginner guides that tout ""Using only what you *already* have in your kitchen,"" some that go for a bare minimum of homebrew supplies, and the some that go all out.

The simpler the guide, the more appealing it is, but the more problems that might arise. And you don't want to have to tell folks, after they've started, that now they need to go buy equipment to fix their problems. People will feel like they got bait-and-switched.

The more thorough the guide, the more off-putting it will be to complete newbies, but the better it can draw in those with some previous experience.

‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòOkay, what was your theory and does it still work?‚Äù and he said, ‚ÄòYes it does. Here it is‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äù

But the best part is that Moffat is actually planning on using Davies‚Äô idea. His plan for Capaldi‚Äôs Doctor is to 'play that one out over time. It‚Äôs actually quite neat.'""

So, in my opinion, it is going to be a bit more complicated than just playing the ""Time Rift"" card. In Gwen's case, they wanted to give a quick explanation that would ""shut the case"". With Capaldi, apparently there was a plan all along (from the first time RTD cast him in the Whoverse) - so that might require a bit more explanation.

However, it doesn't go in our heads the way you guys think it does. Not all of us consciously decide to break up just for the sake of testing our SOs. In my case, at the moment it really seemed like the relationship was doomed, as I deemed walking away was the only and right option. But then after giving myself some time to calm down, I realized my decision may have been an overreaction. Amid realizing that, I also realized my SO hadn't done anything to stop it, and I couldn't help but wonder if he was really ok with not having me in his life anymore (as opposed to me feeling like the world was ending). Later on after we apologized to each other and made up yada yada yada, I asked him why he hadn't fought for the relationship, because I wanted to know.

So yea... We do overreact sometimes and it clouds our heads into saying things we don't mean. Who isn't guilty of that? I agree girls who purposefully test their SO with this method is immature. But as I read some of the comments, some guys said his ex asked him the same question which must mean she was crazy. I feel like that's really unfair."

I realized at some point that I'd probably be living in Australia for the rest of my life, so I moved back to Canada for three years just to show my wife the country, see everyone one last time, tie up any loose ends, etc. During that time I noticed that my parents seemed to be getting crazier and crazier, and now I kind of wonder whether they were always that way and I just didn't notice or know any better as a kid.

Even now, I don't think they were bad parents. I like them both, I get along with them both, I just don't agree with *any* of the choices they've made for their lives or their childrens lives at any point in their lives.

I have a 19 month old son now and intend to do things pretty differently, but as far as I can tell almost every parent ever says that they're not going to make the same mistakes as their parents, so it's kind of hard for me to tell if my parents mistakes weren't typical.

I'm not sure if that answers your question, but the short answer: I don't really know. They're the only parents I've ever had and it's hard to get a proper reference point."

Sir_Fancy_Pants,AskReddit,1390042242.0,"that's one way to look at it (and has some kind of impact for sure exposure etc) however the reason why i find homosexuality disgusting and am unapologetic about it is for the following reason:

If I find youth beautiful i.e 19-23 year old girls, and that is what gets my ""motor running"" so to speak. then there are clear traits and visual markers that trigger my  desire, the opposite traits likewise trigger my disgust.

So a youthful woman 23 year old woman naked and engaged in sex might be very arousing, but a 98 year old woman doing the same triggers my disgust.

Desire and disgust are two sides of the same coin, if something triggers my desire (femininity/youth/health) etc. the opposite traits triggers my disgust, because they are opposite to what i find desirable.


By finding the thought of old people having sex disgusting is not to invalidate their right to do it, (and the same is true with male homosexuality) but it is my personal preference and to deny me that or to say it is ""Unacceptable"" (which i don't think you are), is actually as intolerant as someone trying to ban or stop homosexuality.

hiphopblacktechasian,AskReddit,1390042790.0,"Senior Year of motherfucking highschool.

So I went to a school that was about 5 minutes away from the beach and so alot of the time me and my friends would plan skip days and hang out at the beach till cross country practice.

I was never a strong swimmer and could only swim like 150m before being completely exhausted (it's funny how running stamina doesn't transfer to swimming). Anyway the waves were ridiculous that day and never in my life have I seen the beach like this, it was like the stuff you see during hurricanes except it was a really sunny day out. The rip current was so strong that day the water was flowing **sideways**. Me and my friends were amazed by how crazy the ocean was and went in since the Flag was green.

So we go in there and get hit by these crazy huge waves for the next hour or so. Each time a wave would hit us we would be sure to do a head count and a couple of times someone's head wouldn't pop up for a good 10-15 seconds because they were dragged 50 meters to the right of us but they would eventually show up. Every few minutes we would have to walk back to our stuff because we would be dragged about 200 meters sideways. These were all signs we should have left the water but the **danger was fun**. Plus we were in relatively shallow water, about shoulder deep.

Then it happened, my friends and I have been dragged about 200 meters and started walking out but this time before we could get out we get hit by several waves in a row and get tumbled around for about 20-30 meters. As soon as we surfaced no one said a single word, because we all felt the danger at that moment and felt the strength of the rip tide. My friends that were in only about a foot of water were struggling to make it to the shore because they kept falling over. 

Unfortunately for me I ended up the furthest from shore which was only about 3ft deep (at my hip). I tried swimming back and remembered that I should swim parallel to a rip current but it was way too strong and was actually pulling me downwards like a vacuum, plus I was really tired. So I tried walking but I could't find footing because the sand can't hold against the force of be being pulled down. I tried taking two steps and failed, at this point the rip current was starting to pull me up off the ground. I knew I had one more try to find footing or I was a goner.

I am able to type this story now because by sum miracle on my third try I was able to make three consecutive strides forward which got me in shallow enough water. When I got to shore I kissed my girlfriend at the time (we were fighting), and told her I was sorry.

I still have a picture from that day, that picture would've probably been at my funeral.

**tl;dr I nearly drowned in 3 feet of water.**

I really hope if his mum is guilty, she serves a long time for this. She obviously knew something had happened to him, yet she called the police and said he went missing. He's been out of nursery since Christmas too, so maybe it's been an ongoing thing and he died as a result."

IFuckinRock,askscience,1390043929.0,"The main reason There is little to no bacteria in municipal tap water is Chlorine. Chlorine is added to the water at the water plants and tests are done to make sure there is enough to kill bacteria. Water plant operaters go out and about every day and test water samples for residual chlorine top make sure that there is enough for safe water. Additional chlorine booster stations can be added into the distribution system for long and or low flow pipe runs to keep the bacteria dead. Although dirt does get into the pipes during construction and water main breaks, the lines are thoroughly flushed once they are installed/repaired to get all of the contaminants out of the lines. As far as algae spores, this can actually be an issue in some placews depending on the water plant, but most clearwells (the giant pool of fresh drinking water waiting to be pumped out) are kept in well sealed rooms with no sunlight penetration so algae doesn't usually have a chance to grow. If there is an algae problem though it will be taken care of before the water leaves the plant so it wouldn't typically be noticed and any small amounts that did make it through would be so diluted you would not taste/recognize it.

I use them for inspiration. Just because the model is rail thin (and trust me, 99.9% of them are), I can still decide whether I like the color, fit, etc of a picture.

savoytruffle,AskReddit,1390044143.0,"Water pressure in most cities is ultimately maintained by electric power.

That is, water is pumped uphill to water tanks on hilltops or on high platforms or on the tops of buildings, and when you turn on your faucet it's gravity that does the instantaneous work.

Now there was once a phenomenon at least in England where everyone would turn on their tea-kettle during down-times in football (soccer) games. It's difficult for the massive base-load power plants (like coal or nuclear) to pick up capacity so quickly. An alternative, especially nowadays is gas turbine generators (basically airplane engines bolted to the ground that make electricity instead of much thrust).

But another alternative for pickup is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity)

Basically two reservoirs are created at the top and bottom of a tall hill. Water is pumped into one and when needed, it's allowed to drain into the bottom past turbines and dynamos that create electricity.

It's a net loss for power overall, but if you fill the up-hill tank using cheap low-demand power and drain it to create on-peak high-demand power, you win.

So that's sort of the electricity example.

I believe there are examples where everyone in Canada flushed their toilets at the time-out of an important hockey game, if you want to get into actual water.

But basically in the real world just letting the faucet run is no problem. It's when huge water mains break that towns run out of water. And they're big enough to crawl through or sometimes walk through standing upright."

Funny thing is that this law is actually quite democratic: very significant part of Russia population is anti-gay (in a sense that it's some kind of perversion that can be tolerated if kept private)."

Having been able to remember something isn't a surefire way of determining consciousness. Consciousness comes in degrees, and during dreaming you're observing and have very limited awareness.

GREGORIOtheLION,malefashionadvice,1390045404.0,"I wish I figured it out at 27.  I had no idea community college classes were so cheap.  Here in Dallas, they were about $150 per class ($50 per credit hour).  Many with pay plans such as half down then 2 payments of 1/4 of the total.  When I was 35, I kicked myself for not going sooner.  It looks uphill especially when you're just starting out, and especially when you're working full time and have to take a developmental math class (because you haven't even seen an algebra problem since '94), but you'll begin to get comfortable with the workload and take more classes at a time. 

Next thing you know, you're transferring to a 4-year (unless of course you want a 2 year certificate from the community college, which are not to be taken lightly.  Many nurses and x-ray techs come from those.  2 years can equal 40-60k).  If you're transferring and your GPA is between 3.0 and 4.0, any public university will have you because you're already a junior and are probably a sure-fire graduate (which helps them as much as it does you).

TL;DR  whether it's to get a masters or your first degree, start now.  27 is a better age to figure it out than 35!"

2)She took advantage of how awesome you are, even if you don't care it isn't ok that she is doing it. 

3)Your wife is ok with deceiving not only you but others who would get in the way of her relationship with her b.f. 

4) The other comments have great points, listen to them too.

So I understand that you want her to be happy, but it is incredibly obvious this relationship is NOT HEALTHY FOR HER. Which means she won't be happy in that relationship. 

TL:DR = Trust your wife when she says something isn't right. Look for the deeper issue in the actions she has taken. Have a good conversation.

Now dude (i'd have to look up his name in my notes) was certain we could find Weed somewhere in this city none of us had ever been to. But for some reason we cocky white people went to a little bistro, had a lunch of the spicy beef and herb salad that is known in Laos (wow so spicy). And then set off to prowl all the markets of this town for pot.

One after another, struck out. This is not a very big city but of course it has no supermarkets. All the markets are open-air or under-big rafter roof free-wheeling markets.

Just when we were about to give up, my crazy Irish friend found a guy who sold him a lot of pot on the cheap. I can't remember specifics since it was years and years ago.

And pot was illegal in Laos. But hoo man it did work. I smoked a little with him on the balcony of his hostel room, then went out to dinner and Beer Lao (the only kind of beer sold in Laos) with the fourth member of our party, to some success."

No Christian radio, no CCM 'scene'. It's pretty nice. What I do like, however, are bands or artists who sometimes write songs from a Christian perspective, like Thrice, Mute Math, The Welcome Wagon and Sufjan Stevens.

Sometimes after holidays to places like the US where there's always a Christian radio station within broadcasting distance, I get home and kinda miss the 5% of songs on those stations that are actually original, however I do think I'd rather be exposed to a small amount of original Christian-inspired music than be constantly drowning in fake sappy 'Jesus Is My Boyfriend' worship songs put out there with the expressed purpose of selling records to naive people.

All it would take is a small mistake and suddenly all of your belongings are out by the curb for anyone to take, or are locked up by the proper landlord your landlord rented from and they are demanding a huge sum to get them back. The smartest thing you could do is to either secure a new flat and get your things in there before you go, or place your items in storage while you are gone. Please don't take this as I am speaking poorly of your flatmate. I'm sure flatmate is a great mate.

ctesibius,AskHistorians,1390046798.0,"As before - it's the United Kingdom, not England.

The last British monarch to veto a bill after it passed in Parliament was Queen Anne in 1708, with the Scots Militia Bill. That was on the advice of her ministers. However later monarchs were able to control who was in the Cabinet and exercised considerable direct control, and they had strong influence on foreign policy. The role of the president in the USAian constitution was based on the role of the monarch at the time of the rebellion, although it has diverged considerably from that model.

There has been some recent fuss over whether the Prince of Wales has had the content of certain bills amended prior to them being submitted to Parliament. This relates to royal estates, not matters such as foreign policy.

However all of this is a diversion. The assumption behind your question is that the method of operation of government in the UK is based on force in the same way as in the USA. This is *almost never* the way that things happen. Influence and common goals are everything. To give an illustration: when your presidential administration is replaced, most of the top level staff are replaced. They are political appointees, and will be replaced if they don't do as told. In contrast the top level staff in the UK are civil servants, and the number of political appointees is very small - mainly roles like Press Officer, where there is a political rather than administrative function. It would be difficult or impossible to sack these civil servants, but they will nevertheless work to implement the policies that the govt sets, or the actions requested by the ministers that they report to.

Or another example: a person from an MP's constituency comes to a ""surgery"" to ask for assistance that they haven't been able to get through normal channels. Assuming it's a reasonable request, the MP picks up the phone and asks someone to implement it. The person on the other end of the phone does not report to the MP, cannot be sacked or sanctioned by the MP, and in fact only complies because of the MP's *influence* rather than power.

Now, to return to the roles of the Queen. Firstly, and most conspicuously, she can call and dismiss Parliament. Normally this is a routine matter. However we have a maximum term for a parliament, not a fixed term. If something like your budget deadlock happened, the Queen could dissolve the parliament, calling for elections three weeks later (our elections are much faster than yours). Normally this is unnecessary as our constitution makes a deadlock less likely, but the High Commissioner (the representative of the Queen) in Australia did do this in the '60s. What would happen during those three weeks? Well remember that the place is run by civil servants, so it's sufficient to have a caretaker Cabinet.

Following an election, an MP is been summoned to the Palace to be asked to form a government (i.e. to become the Prime Minister). This is normally the leader of the party with the majority vote, but there was was a problem in the 60's when the Conservative party won an election but had no way of electing a leader (!). After consultation, the Queen appointed Harold MacMillan as Prime Minister. 

Now we turn to one of the most important roles of the monarch, and one which most illustrates my point about influence vs power. Every week, the PM visits the Queen to discuss current affairs. Her role is to be informed, to be consulted, and to advise (I believe that is the correct description). Now bear in mind that she has had these discussions since Winston Churchill was in office. Recent PM's have said that it is enormously useful to draw on that experience.

Now, with great reluctance because it will refocus your mind on ""power"" rather than influence: the question you asked about use of the armed forces. No, the Queen would not veto an expeditionary force into Syria. That would rightly be a decision taken by the Cabinet, and her role is not to block  decisions taken within the constitution by the govt. However the head of the Royal Navy has stated that if the PM were to order a nuclear attack which in his view was not sane, he would ask the Queen to confirm or veto it in her role as head of the armed forces. Note that this is a request coming upwards, rather than starting as an order coming downwards."

tke627,videos,1390046883.0,"&gt; It's condescending to remind people to ""keep it civil, not commit any logical fallacies, and keep an open mind"". 

On reddit it's usually required. If I'm expressing an unpopular opinion there are usually many replies which are meant to insult me and don't do much else. So I suppose I was really trying to say if I don't find your post worth my time I won't respond. Unfortunately I've never had this discussion with anyone before so even if you did insult me I wanted to see where it went. 

&gt;You're also abdicating yourself of these flaws without really earning it, which is arrogant.

In retrospect I agree I should give everyone else the benefit of the doubt just as I give it to myself.

&gt;I have the feeling you don't realize how much of a dom you are in conversation.

I guess it may come across like that, but this is just how I was taught to discuss thing/argue my points in school/uni and by my parents. I was hoping to get my message across in a clear concise manner and to keep the discussion going(as in don't let it fizzle out before things get resolved).

&gt; think you are rarely the victim of serious, panic-inducing introspection

That is a *hell* of a statement to make after reading a few things I posted online. Fuck many people are *only* able to express themselves online where they are anonymous. Anyway I don't find the need to have to explain my...confidence? introspectiveness? whatever it is you're talking about, here. 

&gt;I think people trust you less than you think they do.

ok? I'm not sure why you feel you can claim you know what I think or why you can claim to know how people in my life think, but I really don't know how to respond to a statement like that...in my eyes it's an ad hominem attack, which your replies to me have been laced with. I get the vibe that you don't like me much, are insulting me, are trolling me, or a combination there of. Whatever it is I've been trying to stay away from it and keep the discussion on or close to the point.

&gt;To be fair, no one on reddit chooses their words carefully enough to actually have a well-intentioned debate with anyone else, because what that would entail is a bunch of people not expressing opinions about things for which they do not have the context or experience. 

Why is this a bad thing? If you have an opinion about something which you have experience/context of talk to someone who does will give you information you previously didn't have. For example people who would like to ban 'high capacity' magazines usually don't understand guns all that well. Should they have a discussion with someone who does they may change their opinion and even is they don't both parties gained some new information.

&gt;Just a bunch of questions and people asking for clarification about the questions that have already been asked.

While it never hurts to ask, people should always attempt to go out and find it themselves first...but I won't lie I am guilty of doing this myself.

shadow1515,news,1390047193.0,"It's not vengeance, it's adjusting the punishment to account for opportunity cost. If you steal $50k from me and then give it back a year later, you owe me more than $50k because if I'd had that money I would have invested it and turned it into more. Can you imagine what someone could have done with *11 years* of his life? 

It also doesn't have to be punishment. If someone has a history of doing this, they are too dangerous to keep out in society. The chance that they will hurt someone else justifies taking away their own freedom forever. We already know they are likely to abuse that freedom to take away that of others, so the fairest solution is to remove theirs."

&gt;Whether it has been a good policy remains to be seen. 

I prefer to live in a poor free market than in a society where politicians have undefined budget, but that's just me.

That unemployment is natural, it's a systemic contraction determined by a economical reset of over inflated economic gains, exactly the thing Ireland spain italy and greece have been guilty of. The most terrifying thing is that there is no immediate threat and governments won't stop QE, and by freezing the debt there are no short term danger signs, and this makes QE extremely dangerous, in a world of demagogues and live for the moment politics.

The Euro is still transitionally relevant, so it worked. I blame the UK for rejecting dialogue on the matter, without the UK any tax would have been simply circumvented by moving funds to UK based subsidiary, the company would have no restriction to the eurozone and circumvent the tax, without the participation of the UK it would have meant a extreme handicap for companies in the rest of the EU. You can't have the cake and eat it to. It's less about the money and more about making a stand, this is Europe, not the US, abusing the financial system will not be tolerated.

I've bounced back and forth between various shitty jobs because I didn't finish university, and there's no way to get a decent job (unless you're very lucky) without a degree in this country.  I recently fell into a good spot, though (here's the lucky), and got a job as the boatyard administrator at my local marina.  I adore boats and sailing, and really enjoy the job, even when it's hard.  It's got a good potential future, too - it should be relatively easy to climb the management ladder without having to actually leave the marina-level stuff and go to head office.  For the first time ever, I'm happy with my job.

The only people that have unlawful guns in this country tend to be organised/semi-organised crime gang members, and the occasional ""I grew up on an estate and isn't it cool to shoot someone from the neighbouring one"" kid who is generally immediately caught and sent to prison.

And with moe, it all depends on whether or not it's well done moe. Moe isn't my end-all-and-be-all goal of existence... but it does help on occasion. Let's take some of my favorite shows as an example. BECK: no moe. Kimi ni Todoke: no moe. K-On!: all moe. Bebop: no moe. 5cm/sec: no moe. White Album 2: moe. Clannad: moe. 

Are you starting to see a trend? No? Good. Because there is no trend. I don't like or dislike an anime because of moe. I like or dislike an anime depending on whether or not it is good. Ecchi, on the other hand... Well, as long as there is a decent plot to go with all the PLOT, I'm perfectly fine with PLOT. Although I still prefer plot over PLOT. 

And here's a question back for the panel...

Seriously, people. If someone likes moe tsundere schoolgirls and you don't, untie your pantsu from that Gordian double clove hitch they got knotted into while you were wearing them and just go click a link for something that you yourself like. It's better for your blood pressure.

I can check the time while I'm on the beach (it's waterproof and I wouldn't have my phone because I'm probably wearing shorts, either way I don't see much on its screen in the sun). And when my smartphone is dead which happens on occasion (and frankly, batteries are not getting any better), I can still check the time.

And its wtf because theres only 400$ per month left after factoring in every single expense, expected and unexpected.

Here's an idea, since you can support your family of 6 on one person's salary, have your wife get a job... Then you'll have everything she earns as bonus cash right? You know why that isnt happening? I know, because I deal with jerkoffs like this every day... Its because if she got a job you would have to pay someone part time to watch your kids, and her value as an employee isnt worth the cost it would incur to hire a nanny who has no education and no qualifications to babysit 4 kids for the like 5 hours between the end of school and when you would get home.

* They cause more accidents (20% of all traffic accidents come from the lack of sleep)

I found a recipe for coconut curry tilapia on rice.

The tricky part is it was for 12 people and I usually cook for just myself and my brother usually doesn't cook at all.

Ultimately the fish curry came together very well and was delicious but I had trouble with the rice of all things.

I consulted with my aunt to get the serving portions right, but she underestimated it severely. And then I wasn't used to cooking rice in such massive quantities at 7,000 feet.

So the rice took too long to get done and there was too little of it. Oh well.

Chinksta,AskReddit,1390048876.0,"When I was little, I love exploring the backyard and the fields next to my home. I was a nature freak back then, just love playing outside. I remember I was really fascinated about red ants. About how big they are compared to the black ones and how they use their pincers to fend off against things/pick stuff up with. 

I remember having a mini picnic with my family, and I told them about the red ant hive that I found. I took them to it and yeah...that's when things get ugly.

I didn't see their mini expansion camp next to it, which I was standing RIGHT on top of it, causing them to panic and bite my shoe. I didn't notice anything because they were fighting my shoe but I was looking at the main hive and noticed that there were larvaes transporting from somewhere to the main hive and how a SHITTON of red ants coming out.

My mom and dad backed off and went back to the picnic area which leaves me and my little brother (We were like what... 6 and 5 or something). 

Then the red ants ran up my legs and bite it. At this point, I felt slow numb/pain coming up my body and I looked down and saw my legs are completely covered with red. I freaked out trying to brush them off but it got worst when I can't move one of my left leg because it was numb. I started kicking and screaming, which my brother ran and got my parents because he was scared.

I started to kick my legs out as hard as I can and mother fucking kicked the main hive, that's when I was thinking that I might die because I can't really escape because my legs were numb. 

My parents grabbed water and started pouring on my leg and used their hats to beat off the red ants on my legs, they carried me and rushed my back home. 

My legs were swollen and numb and I can't feel my legs and my body. Went to the hospital and got it checked out and they told me that I'll be fine and this would heal in time.

Till this day, everytime I go to the park or some nature hike, I keep on looking down on every step I take. "

NSA is supposed to be the cryptologic and communications and etc spy agency for the US. And it's been doing it for a while.

It's only spying on Americans that make Americans upset. Americans don't care, and in fact expect the NSA to spy on the rest of the world.

What's surprising lately is they are so very good at doing it, and spying on the rest of the world entails spying on America too (because most of the world's internet stuff goes thru America).

And NSA isn't supposed to do that and oh they say they don't, but oh it turns out they maybe do anyway, and oh christ almighty.

So I don't know what to think. It's not as if we can disband the NSA. Every other government has the equivalent of the NSA doing the same things, although perhaps not as well.

citadel_lewis,DebateReligion,1390049923.0,"&gt;I'd say I know there's no God in the same sense that I know the world is not flat: I assign a sufficiently low probability to these terms such that they fit into the ""believe false"" category.

But that's not knowledge. If we're discussing epistemology, knowledge is usually defined as a justified, true belief. What you are describing is a belief only (not the flat earth bit). 

If your definition of ""knowing"" something is being able to assign it to the ""believe false"" or ""believe true"" category, then I find it hard to reconcile your identification as an extreme skeptic who denies the ability to even know ""I think, therefore I am"". This type of skepticism requires strict definitions of knowledge. It also requires one to provide mechanisms such as evil demons, cosmic computer programmers etc to justify the belief that you might not be you. These are the very type of mechanisms that you claim to know don't exist.

I can't see how the extreme skepticism you subscribe to isn't mutually exclusive of gnostic atheism without equivocating on the definition of knowledge, which isn't an option in epistemological matters."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390050146.0,"Figuring out why you make this assumption could help you get past this. Are you surrounded by users? Maybe one super scumbag user is a big part of your life? If so, it would make sense that you would be cynical and suspicious of others. 

Or maybe you tend towards using people and have difficulty giving back, so that is your base assumption of others as well? If that were true, then the place to start would be with you. If you can try to once a day try to empathize with someone else, and do something for them, maybe you'll notice other people doing this too.

Maybe in the end, the why doesn't matter.

Maybe the thing to do is look at the people in your life, one by one. Really consider their actions over time. Do they think about other people ever? Do they ever give back or want to share experiences? Or is it really all about them?

It's okay, and probably actually really good, to be aware of how bad people can be. Then you know what to look for, and you are less likely to be taken advantage of and used yourself. 



Maybe it would be easy to start by, instead of assuming the worst in someone, you look to uncover these bad traits. It might not be such a leap as looking for good traits.  But the difference to make is to be honest about what those traits are you consider bad, and how much  of their lives it affects, and how frequently you see it. If it isn't very frequently, or only in certain contexts, by default, they have to have decent behavior the rest of the time.  

Then by looking at *those* people, you could watch for good traits that you might not have been able to see before.

There are, as I said, habitual users that are to be seriously watched out for.

But I think far more common is for people to have certain categories of their life, or types of interactions, that they struggle with (and/or suck at).  Like being a fantastic boss but completely taking for granted his/her family.  Or has a lot to contribute and listens wells to  women, but has problems listening fairly and non-judgmentally to men. Etc.

And, really, really common is for people to have trigger issues, that make them defensive, or passive aggressive. And then they turn into completely selfish people. But they aren't all the time. Not that this behavior is okay, just that you learn, ""Wow, I should *really* not bring up their spending habits."" or ""Holy shit, that person has mommy/daddy issues."" And you allow them to be flawed humans, just as you are.  And you stay away from those topics, to be considerate of them.

It really isn't so simple to say people are good or bad, scumbag or not.  We all have our moments.  We all have areas we suck in and should probably work on.

And that is okay.

There are customizable weapon loadouts but every weapon can be found just playing through the game with no cash input into the game. There is an upgrade to premium option (the premium players have a larger backpack and the ability to trade items they find from drops) but the way its done is quite excellent where if you just buy anything from the store you get the premium upgrade plus the item you bought, you dont have to pay specifically for premium.

tendorphin,neuro,1390050319.0,"If you have this issue only when writing, then it could be one of two things. First, it could be, as stated, dyslexia. That's only if it is relatively consistent and severe, and plagues both word order and letter order within words (I think). Second, it could just be that you're better at speaking the language than writing it. Speech is controlled by Broca's area in the frontal lobe (little bit of temporal lobe) while writing is controlled by the Angular Gyrus in the parietal lobe. I'm sure there is some communication between Broca's and the AG, and a lot of communication between broca's and wernicke's (via the arcuate fasciculus) but by and large the AG communicates more with Wernicke's area, which is responsible for speech comprehension and word meaning when speaking. I am way better at writing than speaking. Had this answer been spoken to you by me, I'd have stammered, searched for correct words, and rephrased things several times, as well as just been less concise with my speech, whereas when I write it down the words just come to me quickly and easily.

Thus lucid dreaming adds more 'load', the very same 'load' the function of sleep is reducing.

Formula runs us about ~$80/mo. (and my son is a *guzzler*), diapers about $35/mo. Clothes we usually buy secondhand gradually over time or swap with other parents, same with most toys and gear. Some months we'll have some extra expenses, sure, like when we had to move him up to his convertible car seat or we had to babyproof. But usually, $150/mo. is the average. I put away an extra $25/mo. into a separate account linked to my main bank account that's my Uh Oh stash for stuff like that. 

The one caveat is that our total includes zero daycare or babysitting; we couldn't afford either on 1.5 (effective, post taxes and insurance) minimum wage incomes. He works days, I work graveyard, and we'll beer money a friend or borrow a generous family member maybe once a month to go out.

Whatever you will do to become better, you will have to work hard for it. There is no easy cure, I'm sorry. But what matters is, it is totally possible to become better. What will help you immensly is making all the right lifestyle choices, for example DO go exercise, what you do doesn't even matter, as long as you do it. Cut caffeine out of your life.

Exactly, move outside of the EU, but the EU is the second biggest market in the world, so they would have to choose if they want to make money from financial services (that would have been exempt under a certain value under the French tax model) or derivatives juggling(which doesn't produce organic economic growth so we don't need it anyway).

Again it's not about the actual tax income, it's about presenting a unified front.

Older still and it became about my height and inability to attract girls. Now I'm at university and it's about being a vegan.

Letting it get to you just makes your life miserable. Standing tall and telling them to either a) fuck off or b) by making a joke/comment back is the best you can do.

tallulahblue,MakeupAddiction,1390051169.0,"&gt; She says not so nice things about other, established artists as well.

I don't think she's said anything that I disagree with. Examples:

""A song came out recently by a big pop star [Selena] and the lyrical thing is 'when you're ready come and get it, I'll be sitting right here just waiting' and I just find that so pathetic and I don't think girls should be listening to that kind of thing and I don't think that is normal or healthy""

and: ""I listened to that Lana Del Rey record and the whole time I was just thinking it‚Äôs so unhealthy for girls to be listening to, you know, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm nothing without you.‚Äô This sort of shirt-tugging, desperate, ‚Äòdon‚Äôt leave me‚Äô stuff. That‚Äôs not a good thing for young girls, even young people, to hear.""

and: ""I think women who say, 'No, I'm not a feminist - I love men,' I think that is just...You don't know what it means. You think it means that, 'I don't shave under my arms, I burn my bras. Fuck men!' How could you be so uneducated, and so unwilling to learn about something which is so important to you?""

and: ""I think there‚Äôs a funny culture in music that‚Äôs only happened over the last 15 years, that if you have an opinion about something in music that isn‚Äôt 100 per cent good, you‚Äôre a ‚Äòhater‚Äô. Even if you have perfectly reasonable grounds for that critique.""

and: ""I feel like the influences that are there in the industry for people my age, like Justin Bieber or whatever, are just maybe not a very real depiction of what it's like to be a young person.""

Of course not! His life is nothing like a regular young person's. He's been famous since, what, age 11? He's not like his fans. 

The only one I'd say was out of line was when asked if she'd work with David Guetta and she said, ""No, fuck no, he's so gross."" 

And I think she was *unintentionally* out of line when she said ""Taylor Swift is so flawless, and so unattainable, and I don't think it's breeding anything good in young girls"" ... I think she later retracted it and said Taylor was a great role model for her fans. It seemed like what she was getting at was that young girls shouldn't aspire to be as thin / ""perfect"" as Taylor? 

And mildly iffy: [On Miley etc.] ""The difference between those kids and me is that I grew up completely normally and went to parties and had that experience. I am way less inclined to be like, 'Look! I'm fucking mental!‚Äô""

It's the same kind of thing *I* think all the time. Nobody understands why Miley is being so ""trashy"" because we haven't had that child-star upbringing. If I became a celebrity overnight I'd probably say the same thing - I'm not going to be like that because I've had a totally normal up-bringing. 

I think she's saying what a lot of people are thinking but it's like when you're a celebrity you have to be 100% supportive of every other celebrity, no matter what they do, no matter how much of a bad influence on their fans you think they might be, no matter how anti-feminist their lyrics or actions. If you're a celebrity you're expected to be lovely and sweet to everyone and never have any strong opinions. I'm glad that she does, and I'm glad she shares them. She's new to fame and is still finding her feet and probably just realising how people can spin her words into ""controversies"" and ""cat fights"".

If you are going to get women's college football to take off, you need it to take off at the high school level, first.  To make that happen you have to invest in pads, uniforms, coaches, trainers, field time, etc.  Football takes, seemingly, a million times the number of non-players on the sideline.  In addition to all those resources you need, you know, players.  Lots of them.  Even if they play 8-man, they would need probably 20 on a team to function.  Now if you're a 14-year-old girl entering high school and you have the option of playing soccer in the spring or football - assuming they make football a spring sport to try to not overlap on resources needed - what would you do?  You've probably played soccer most of your life, have zero experience in football, and the head coach has zero experience coaching girls.

**On the Battle of Zama**

[Here's a basic map of the battlefield layout.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Mohammad_adil_rais-battle_of_zama-1.PNG) I note that it's basic because it doesn't note the *velites* at all, which is irritating, but meh. It shows the ranks of the Romans - with the Hastati in the first line, the Principes in the second, and the Triarii in the third. [Here](http://agemaminiatures.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Roman-formation2.jpg) is the basic layout of the ""checkerboard"" manipular legion. Note that most times, generals wouldn't be able to do fancy manuevers with these maniples, other than to choose when to commit the next line to battle. However, Scipio's veterans were able to be worked with more efficiently - so he had his *principes* move to the side in order to creates a straight lane through the maniples (see how that works?) and filled those lanes with *velites*. The difference would be impossible to distinguish for Hannibal, and a small(er) force of skirmishers ran out front, harassing the elephants and drawing them to these lanes (The ones that weren't panicked by Scipio's cavalry and their trumpets). The elephants, needled into charging down the lanes, headed straight through the Roman formation without causing the Romans any trouble - and they were dealt with behind the Roman lines by a force of men specially trained to deal with elephants. The *velites* left the lanes, the *principes* got back into their proper position, and it was game on. 

The rest of the battle occurred as I noted above - 

&gt; Hannibal and Scipio both used a three line formation while their cavalry fought - however, Hannibal's only veterans were in the third line of his formation. First line fought first line, the Carthaginians began to waver, so Hannibal sent in his second line. Then the Roman line began to waver, so Scipio sent in his principes. Then both lines backed off, with the Carthaginians almost routing. Both generals reformed their men into one line and sent them against each other - and then, the victorious Roman (Numidian) cavalry returned to hit Hannibal in the rear, shattering his army.

The Carthaginians were **not** encircled at Zama. They were **not** boxed in by Scipio - the cavalry just hit from the rear after they'd chased off the Carthaginian cavalry, which is a classic hammer-anvil military manuever. 

Next- the maniples *were* quintessential to this victory. Think of the maniples themselves as less of a military formation and more of a ""unit."" There are lots of ""units"" that make up the formation - and this was what allowed the maniple to be more flexible than its contemporaries. You had an officer (two, including the *optio*) who could make snap decisions with every maniple of men, and who kept them together and kept morale high. 

Also, I noted that the *tactics* were comparable to a brawl - not the actual fighting. Fighting in the ancient world is something that's almost impossible for the modern mind to comprehend, especially when we have the constant flood of false context from Hollywood.

As for what happened at Cannae, please read the description I gave. Hannibal's centre was more of a...elastic formation, while his flanks were *extremely* deep. The Romans hit his centre, pushing past his flanks, who then collapsed onto the Roman army - three sides of a box, if you will. The cavalry completed the closing of the lid. 

Finally!

&gt; Until 107 BC this is true. But my Answer and Rome go much farther (wide, admittedly, and not deep than) than 107 BC. 

The ""manipular legion"" refers to ca. 400 BCE when the manipular legion replaced the phalanx to ca. 107 BCE, when Marius recruited straight from the poor ;) Hope that helped your confusion! If you'd like to understand more about the Roman army, check out Adrian Goldsworthy's *The Complete Roman Army*. For more on Cannae/Zama, check out Robert Donnel's *Ghosts of Cannae* and Goldsworthy's *The Fall of Carthage*."

fnredditacct,sex,1390051717.0,"Several things...bear with me while I try to unpack this and get my thoughts in order.

Firstly, I think absence of a fetish is not the same as that fetish being a turn-off.  Those are two very different scenarios. 

I have cultivated an appreciation of, and mild/moderate sexual satisfaction in, my husband's cuckolding fetish. But I felt completely neutral to it, as a fetish. I *did* have *real* problems with the practical risks of multiple partners. Which we discussed, and came up with a system of safer sex practices that I was comfortable with.

Having read this again, it's sounding to me like you very much care for him, and really want to be able to do this. But that you are too distant from his fetishes to partake in them.

To begin with pegging: it is okay that it's not something you enjoy.  Very okay.  And so it makes total sense that you would struggle with understand his pleasure in it. And it's super kind and loving of you to try to understand and do it anyway. But it's about more than just the anal stimulation. Pegging (IMO) differs from using anal toys in the domination of the man by the woman. It is more...feminizing? Lets the man feel more that he is 'taking the role of the woman.' Which puts the woman in 'taking the role of the man.' Even is that's not what she's feeling, that the position his feelings put her in.  

And if that position, and/or him putting you in that position doesn't feel good to you, and in fact, feels bad, this is **not** for you. It is NOT your job to feel bad in order to make him feel good, satisfied and loved.  It is certainly not good for you to do that, but also it would not be good for your relationship for you to take that personal hit.

Beastiality is a very seriously separate thing. In fantasy, not illegal. (At least, I don't think so...I think drawings of and erotica involving child porn are illegal in some places, don't know if the same is true or beastiality). (Watching actual footage *might* be illegal.) But given the lying and trust issues, as well as the possibly legality...I can't recommend you struggling to be okay with this.

If the rest of your relationship was amazing, supportive, and loving, and if he goes above and beyond to satisfy you sexually, and meet your needs, maybe that is a different story.

But this is looking like a very serious sexual incompatibility from my end."

""I mean, I never actually TRIED to do this thing but since I'm pretty sure that the deck is stacked against me and cis het males might be there and trigger me I need to abolish that before I can even try without having a panic stroke at all the expectations placed on me by my peers.""

Even if someone does not like or agree with Tina Fey's school of feminism, her approach to solving what she perceived as the reality of the comedy world as she entered it is exactly the way someone should go about changing anything they dislike about society -- Did they say you can't do XYZ? Don't talk about it, do it. If you end up being unable to do XYZ, then shut up. If you can do XYZ, the very fact you did it says more then any words ever could. 

SJW are usually really, really entitled and really, really privileged. They're like college communists, they REALLY believe that everyone should do it, but they'll be the brains while you guys go till the soil. 

Most of them have been spoiled, told how clever they were by teachers and parents and lived very comfortably their whole lives. They actually are deluded enough to think that what they do on Tumblr is so brilliant and ground breaking they deserve donations.

SamCropper,AskReddit,1390052693.0,"I wasn't really fearing for my life, but it was pretty scary: I was walking round Amsterdam at around 2/3am, but it was still reasonably busy. I made contact with a pedestrian walking the other way, but it was no more than a light, accidental bump you might expect when walking against people. I turned round to apologise (even though both parties seemed equally responsible). There was an extremely worse for wear homeless African-Dutch man standing glaring at me. I acknowledged the mistake by giving him a wave/ nod of the head or something (I was quite far away from him at this point) and continued walking. We carried on towards our destination (if I remember correctly, Barney's Coffeeshop), but I was aware I could hear the same voice shouting something in Dutch behind us. This happened several times before I glanced behind us, lo and behold, the same dude is there, looking right at me looking very, very angry. He was obviously following us. Eventually he caught up to us and said something (in Dutch) which made it clear he wanted to say something to us. We stopped and turned around. He looked 40 something, but was probably less, wearing battered shoes and dirty clothes. His eyes were all over the place and there was snot pouring from his nose. He was obviously fucked up. I don't speak Dutch, so we had to enter into a game of aggressive charades with this dude. He was holding out something in his hand... A crack pipe. He was miming something falling out of his pipe and onto the floor, then holding his free hand out expectantly. It was clear he was accusing me of knocking into him, spilling his crack on the floor and wanted reparations. The little we could understand of his Dinglish was ""‚Ç¨20"". We made it clear we weren't going to give him ‚Ç¨20, partly because we didn't have ‚Ç¨20 between us (it was our last day and everyone had run out of money), and partly because I'm not going to buy a man crack. I twigged pretty early on that this guy was trying to scam us young and na√Øve tourists out of a bit of our holiday Monopoly money. He then started shouting ""‚Ç¨10!"" Along with ""you make a fool of me"" and ""I'll have you killed""... We told him we weren't going to give him ‚Ç¨10 either and carried on walking. He pursued us again asking now for ‚Ç¨5... This pretty much confirmed I hadn't actually wronged him, he was just trying to get whatever money he could from us. I refused, but instead offered him a packet of Nerds I'd just bought that were in my pocket. He shouted some profanities and sloped off (without my Nerds) into the night. I was a 6'8"" 19 year old, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't shaken. Mike Skinner said it best: ""Amsterdam ain't a nice place off your face"""

almightybob1,JusticePorn,1390052841.0,"So you think this sub is biased against instances of actual rape. Well let's check!

First we filter /r/Justiceporn by searching for ""rape"" and choosing to order by ""new"" [like so](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/search?q=rape&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on).

#Now let's do a count.

There's this very link we're on right now. **1** false accusation.

[PA man charged in child rape](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/1ujmig/pa_man_charged_in_child_rape_based_on_evidence/) - 11 days ago - **1** actual rape.

[Justice served for rapist even after police give up](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/1sv0d2/justice_is_served_even_after_the_police_give_up/) - 1 month ago - **2** actual rape.

[Cop who failed to pursue rape case jailed](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/1slesr/policewoman_who_deliberately_did_not_pursue_a/) - 1 month ago - **3** actual rape.

[Jury convicts woman in false rape case](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/1s8x69/jury_quickly_convicts_woman_in_false_rape_trial/) (covers the exact same story as this post, but for the sake of argument I'll count it anyway) - 1 month ago - **2** false accusation.

[Ex-con gets life for rape](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/1rx7ap/excon_who_explained_texas_prison_life_to_reddit/) - 1 month ago - **4** actual rape.

[Ian Watkins jailed for child rape](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/1rireo/lostprophets_singer_ian_watkins_pleads_guilty_to/) - 1 month ago - **5** actual rape.

[Four more charged in Steubenville case](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/1rfcpv/four_more_charged_in_steubenville_rape_case/) - 1 month ago - **6** actual rape.

[Man gets jail time for Facebook rape confession](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/1r8i0l/man_gets_jail_time_for_rape_after_facebook/) - 1 month ago - **7** actual rape.

[Executed for raping woman in India](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/1r23yo/execution_for_raping_woman_in_india_newscast/) - 1 month ago - **8** actual rape.

#That rather neatly rounds us off at 1 month's worth of links and the 10 most recent links, so I'll stop there because otherwise I'd be here all day.

The final score is **actual rape 8 -2 false accusation.** And that's counting both stories about the same case as two separate false accusation links. 

So in conclusion, even trying to be as generous as possible to your opinion, the number of actual rape articles posted to /r/JusticePorn *far* outweighs the number of false accusation posts we have.

[I have one final link you might find interesting.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)"

wwwwolf,explainlikeimfive,1390053135.0,"NES may be a little bit bad example because NES emulation is actually very well researched and Nintendo themselves have invested heavily into it (just look at all the Virtual Console stuff).

But pretty much everything from Nintendo 64 onward is written in higher-level languages, so it doesn't actually make sense to (very inefficiently) emulate the whole platform when you can just port the software to the new platform and it will run much more efficiently. You can then throw in new textures and call it a ""HD rerelease"".

One of the things that will bite the porters in the butt is that a lot of games used platform-specific optimisations and tricks. For example, people were absolutely flabbergasted by the awesome graphics in Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2 on GameCube. Later, they released the Metroid Prime Trilogy collection for Wii. They just figured that in Wii version, Samus's arm cannon should be freely targetable with the Wiimote like in Metroid Prime 3 - yet in MP1 and MP2, some of the graphical effects for the arm cannon were actually 2D animations and depended on the arm cannon being on the same fixed place in the screen. That was a performance-related shortcut they made for GameCube, and it bit them in the butt because they needed to redo it completely (can't remember if they even did that, I haven't played the Trilogy release myself).

A lot of optimisations like that will cause problems when porting the games over. And the developers have used *a lot* of them, because, as everyone knows, Nintendo hasn't ever really tried to compete with performance, they want the consoles to be in the affordable range."

It came with a laptop I ordered online. I could have lived with the interface and that maybe, but there were just some things that made me really mad:

* COPYING: I bought a very good Laptop, but the copying speed was insanely slow. It would have been much faster if I would upload and download it to/from the internet (50MBit though) 

* GAMING: When playing a game in fullscreen, it would randomly jump to the desktop which is *slightly inconvenient* when you are facing a hoard of zombies is Resident Evil.

* GETTING IT OFF: Due to the UEFI-BIOS that was built in it was nearly impossible to get off Windows 8. To even access the Bios you had to restart about 2 times getting into all kinds of setting menus, without the help of the internet I would have been completely lost. Also, without doing that you could not just simply boot from a CD. I took me about 2 hours to get it off and install Windows 7.

After successfully getting it off I realized how fast my Laptop was able to be and how nice of a thing it was to not have a Tablet System crammed onto your Computer."

YouBWrong,germany,1390053173.0,"Tell me about it.  One of the things that I do is process account requests for our secure data transfer solution.  99% of requests come to me as a filled out copy of our word doc.  1% are  from our consultants in Germany who will print out our doc and then fill it in by hand, scan it to pdf and then mail to me.  The scan is usually shitty quality and their handwriting worse.  So instead of me just copying and pasting their information into the account, I have to transcribe what I think they probably wrote.

I do think part of this is also because of the Germans and their history with ISDN.  The only telecom solution in Germany for a long time was the state owned Telekom which was a little slow getting into broadband but heavily invested in ISDN.

On average, equally skilled men do outproduce equally skilled women in tasks that hinge on raw muscle.

etotheipith,SubredditDrama,1390053443.0,"&gt; What my problem with the patriarchy is? Well, the biggest one is that it doesn't coincide with reality. The second largest problem I have with it is how ideological it is. It assumes a conclusion, and find the evidence to support that conclusion. That is now you how get the truth.

You haven't defined what you think patriarchy is, though. Do you think 'a social system that is oppressive to women' does not coincide with reality? Note that this does not mean men can't be screwed over by this system, just that comparatively, women get the short end of the stick.
&gt;If we lived in the Victorian ages, I would agree that we had a patriarchy, but still, the noblewoman would fare much better than the peasant. Hell, I'd prefer to stay at home taking care of the kids than breaking my back in the fields for sixteen hours a day, or slowly suffocating in a mine to support my family. But sure, it was a patriarchal society, especially by definition.

Alright, I think I see what your problem is. You think that the concept of patriarchy obscures the other oppressive relations in a society, in this case class. Have you read about [intersectionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality)? This is one of the most important concepts in feminism (and sociology) of the past decades, and has strived to take the focus of feminism away from the struggles of the white affluent woman to that of all oppressed classes."

jm434,vegan,1390053562.0,"Haha my food 'budget' is cheaper than everyone elses.

My city has two advantages. a) It has a large indian/middle eastern population and hence the city is geared towards vegetarian and vegan lifestyles. b) It has the largest (supposedly) open food market in Europe and is open 6 days a week.

So because places like Wholefoods in US isn't a thing in the UK, I bulk buy rice, pasta, noodles and several varieties of dried beans, pulses, lentils etc from the internet. 

For example a 10kg bag of broken basmai rice (all the bits that they usually use for animal feed and such) costs me ¬£8 (like 14$) and it lasts me about 7-8months. 

So with my main protein and such intake out of the way. I then typically buy 4-5 different types of vegetable and 3-4 types of fruit each week from that open market. This overall costs me ¬£7-8 (again roughly 14$) each week.

Then I go to an independant veg/vegan/organic store to buy things like oil, herbs n spices, oats, raisins and the occasional soya milk/butter and flour. I've considered bulk buying raisins/oats because they have become my standard breakfast, however it's too far into the academic year now to make it worth it.

Overall I spend on average ¬£10 (16$) a week on food, ignoring the initial cost of bulk buying at the start of the academic year. 


For everything else, there are plenty of veg/vegan restaurants and fast food places in my city for my 'going out to eat' days with friends. Currently I am the sole non-meat eater in my circle of friends, yep not even a vegetarian. I do pretty well."

The fact that they feel the need to write about it suggests that the practice in society was at odds with their prescriptions. In that regard I would like to refer to the image of the industrious, chaste, morally superior woman crying at home waiting for her philandering, drunk, violent husband to come home.. Which came to the fore in a period where women undoubtedly *did* have less rights legally. (And was quite a turnaround from the carnal seductress that haunted the nightmares of the church fathers.)

GBA didn't ship out ¬®~80 million models in 4 years. If you actually look at the [financial statement](http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/library/historical_data/pdf/consolidated_sales_e1309.pdf) from Nintendo, the numbers display the following story between the handhelds only using numbers uncluding the year the models have overlapped:

Gameboy + Gameboy Color: 115.7 million copies over 12 years over 5 models

Gameboy Advance: 67.8 million copies over 5 years and 3 models.

DS: 146.4 million copies over 7 years and 4 models.

Even taking those numbers, and dividing them per years of selling those models, and then dividing per amount of models, the DS does still get the biggest number per year per model (5.23 million per year per model, vs 1.93 for Gameboy and 4.52 for GBA). 
In 2011 Nintendo released 3DS. You know... the successor to the DS. A new generation shipping usually means that the previous generation will take a big hit as evidenced by every console ever released in history (maybe aside from the ps2). You are factually wrong in every way imaginable on this. 

You may need to revise your standing ""in the industry, because you have shown no knowledge in this area that has shed any light on what you are saying. I sincerely doubt your intimate knowledge of Nintendo, and you have done everything to demonstrate the opposite all in the name of attempting to prove a point by moving the goalposts each time.

Nintendo has been in the GPU game for a long time, it's true. But for the last 3 console generations, Nintendo has been partnered with ATI/AMD for graphics because they simply can't compete with Sony and Microsofts graphical solutions in terms of their own abilities to produce the hardware.

The improvement of especially graphics, have usualy meant that the sizes of development teams and need for development time has been made larger and longer for AAA games. This is something Nintendo was able to not have big issues with last gen since the Wii was basically a modified gamecube in terms of graphical abilities and no HD output abilities. But after making the switch to HD, and significantly improving the graphical capabilities of the Wii U compared to the Wii, they have had to delay several games because to make a game competetively looking with the competition takes a lot of manpower, and Nintendo was simply not ready for the impact this had which lead to the delays in games.

tallulahblue,MakeupAddiction,1390054532.0,"I think she's referring to people specifically who say they aren't a feminist because they ""love men"" - which means they have likely bought into the stereotype that feminists *hate* men... she took that further and assumed that if you believe feminists hate men you probably believe other stereotypes such as that feminists all have hairy arm-pits and burn bras. 

She's saying that instead of buying into stereotypes they should educate themselves on feminism. 

She's not alienating the feminists that *do* fit the stereotype, just saying that if you think that's all that feminism means, you haven't looked too far into it. 

The quote isn't even about people having ""many valid reasons for not identifying with the mainstream feminist movement"", it's directed at people who specifically don't identify with it because they mistakenly think feminism is just man-haters with hairy pits who burn bras. People who buy into this stereotype probably don't even *know* about ""all the intersectionalities of modern feminism"" since they haven't looked further into it than the stereotypes. 

&gt; I also take issue with the fact that she seems to place the blame on the women rather than patriarchal society which reinforces this idea of ""I'm cooler than feminism."" 

I agree with you on this. If only because I too, once believed the stereotypes. Reddit turned me feminist. I hadn't been exposed to anything but stereotypes, and hadn't had any need or encouragement to look into it from anybody.

One of the main points in the book ""to kill a mockingbird"" is about how the black guy is convicted of the crime and about to be sentenced to death just because he is black and the guy who actually did it was white. In that society the white man's word was enough proof. 

Then there's the point about fair judgment, who decides when its the death penalty and when its life? The judge, what if the judge isnt doing their job properly and people are getting away with murder while others are being executed for lesser crimes? I know your stance on the torture and murder of mother and child but what about that little shithead kid who killed 4? He literally got off scott free because he was too rich and in my book 4&gt;2 so he should be facing the death penalty himself. 

I personally do believe in the death penalty given due process and proper handling but for one thing we have to make sure stuff like the op is writing off doesnt happen.

True, though it will have conferred some selective advantage, which is one of the factors that caused its wide spread. The societies where women were to do the farm work apparently didn't propagate themselves very well.

&gt;Might be true of the Early Modern period, but bears little relation to the Early Medieval, where peasant women labored in the field alongside their husbands.

Skimming the iconographic sources I have here (Les tr√®s riches heures du duc de Berry, for example), it seems to me that it's mostly men, with women added during times of harvest.

Question: Help! I ate non-kosher food, now what? (Gasp, it was tomato sauce without kosher certification apparently lol)

&gt; ...But there is a way that non-kosher food can elevate you. This can happen when the eating of non-kosher food itself stirs you toward spiritual growth. When you regret what you have done and resolve to be extra-cautious in the future, and when you commit to being more careful in your general observance of the dietary laws, reviewing the relevant laws, then you have made the non-kosher food a means for growth.
&gt; 
&gt; Since returning to G‚Äëd needs some action, resolve also to place some coins in a charity box (preferably affixed to the wall of the kitchen) before cooking, and refrain from some of your favorite foods for a few days‚Äîan exercise that helps one gain mastery over one‚Äôs desire for physical pleasures. These actions and intentions will serve to transform what was a fall in spiritual observance‚Äîeven an unintentional one‚Äîinto a step towards a higher spiritual plane.
&gt; 
&gt; This creates an amazing turnaround. The item you ate actually made you more spiritual. The sin had the same impact usually reserved for the observance of a positive commandment: it made you closer to G‚Äëd."

Unrepentant_Priapist,PoliticalDiscussion,1390055622.0,"&gt; Obama got voted in on the backs of people thinking he can change laws, when he's the executive branch.

This seems like an odd example to use; every president ever has gotten elected on the premise that he was going to change laws.  Leaving aside the fact that the president can effect change in the law through various means that exist more or less by convention, and the fact that President Obama has done this (I'll use the ACA as the easy, obvious example), when was the last time you saw anyone run for president pledging only to carefully review legislation sent to his desk by Congress?

&gt; Even better would be if you have to fill in at least one of your candidate's political position correctly.

This is an interesting idea, and I'd like to take it a step further:  What if, instead of voting for candidates, we voted for issues instead?  Let's say that your ballot consists of a series of a dozen multiple-choice questions, the choices consisting of each candidate's preferred answer to the questions and a 'none of the above' option.  Each vote for a specific answer counts as a vote for the associated candidate.  The names/parties of the candidates themselves wouldn't even appear on the ballot.

I can see the selection of the questions themselves being problematic given the potential for corruption of the selection process.  Possibly, we could hold a vote to select the questions themselves.  Each candidate gets to put a certain number of questions up for possible inclusion on the ballot.  Voters then get to vote for the questions they would like to see on the ballot; they should be allowed the same number of votes as there are questions to answer on the final ballot.  Whichever questions get the most votes, the candidates provide their preferred answer to, and everyone votes on them.

No doubt a system like this one has potential problems, just like our current system.  I just thought your idea was an interesting one."

thesleazye,bicycling,1390055690.0,"Great job! Take the time to enjoy riding distances before you worry about speed. Starting out is all about your butt getting used to your seat and slowly building up the endurance and supporting muscle groups.

Once you get comfy with everything, try to add 8km to your ride every other week (unless you want to build up faster and do it weekly). Also work on intervals of riding at an elevated speed for 2-3 minutes and then back to a comfy pace for 10-15. Both of these will build up endurance, stamina, and speed.

Make sure to eat right as you build up. As you get faster your body will need fuel. Eat a small snack about every 15-16km that is mostly complex carbs (grains and oats) and is about 100-200 kcal. It will make you last longer. Drink a bottle of water every 15km as well.

stcamellia,explainlikeimfive,1390056384.0,"I heard a pretty good, uneducated theory on a blog a while back.
People who grow up in Catholic families are expected to marry off and have a bunch of kids. Obviously, some people do not want kids, or more to the point do not experience hetero attraction. They soon learn that the church offers a socially acceptable way to avoid this awkward problem. They can visibly strive for entrance into a church leadership role and NOW they are expected to be celibate! Great! dodged that bullet.

Now, hormones, church indoctrination of power, aggregation of young men who for various reasons might be avoiding marrying a woman and having a catholic amount of children, in varying levels coalesces into the dark and evil.

Things that let it continue? Church settings can be socially stifling and kids have little say in whether they go or not. They feel like they cannot speak out about what happens. Worse, the church, like any self ruling group, has little incentive to DEAL with the problem and the problem priests just get shuffled under various rugs.

This seemed reasonable to me. But it is a complicated issue that gets to the heart of what evil really is. Full disclosure, I was never Catholic. I was raised Protestant. Now an Atheist."
ctesibius,AskHistorians,1390056387.0,"Please - for the third time, it's the United Kingdom. ""England"" is not the same thing. England is one of four countries *within* the United Kingdom.

I appreciate that our country and constitution are not as easily understood as yours, but this is about as basic as it gets.

I assume you were asking whether a new UK PM can force UK civil servants to resign? No, I don't believe so. He can have the top level of civil servants removed from their roles (as opposed to sacked) - I believe that this is done by instructing the Cabinet Secretary, the most senior civil servant. This would be done for incompetence or failure to follow govt policy, both of which are rare. It is also possible to close a department, making the employees redundant, but this comes under normal employment legislation. The covenant is that the Civil Service is apolitical: it advised on what policy should be in some respects, and implements a policy that the govt has determined to follow."

etotheipith,SubredditDrama,1390056576.0,"While reading this, keep in mind that women aren't the sole victims, nor are men the sole perpetators of gendered injustice in society. Your portrayal of feminism as blaming men for all problems and saying women are victims in every way is inaccurate.
&gt; Nope. It's not even that. I don't believe in patriarchy theory, because I don't believe men oppress women to their benefit. I don't think men oppress women at all today.

So we'll discard the idea of men being the oppressors here, and just look at women's social position in society. Here are two ways women are oppressed, and moreso than men:

* Women are heavily sexualised and objectified in media, moreso than men. This contributes to them not being seen as rational beings with agency. Take a look at [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_4dPB9MVS8), and specifically the sources she lists in the description. You don't have to like Laci Green, but the research she cites doesn't lie. Some of the articles also compare men and women.

* Women are shamed for being sexually active, so-called slut-shaming, and this is opposite for men: they are praised for the same thing. Note that, combined with the first point, this places women in a paradoxical position: On the one hand they are sex objects, on the other they can't be too sexual, lest they be perceived as sluts. The wikipedia article on slut-shaming is very good, especially the [first paragraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slut-shaming#Overview).

&gt;I think that if patriarchy theory was 100% correct, feminism wouldn't have become what it is. It wouldn't have gotten the insane amount of support that it did.

Again, patriarchy doesn't mean that men have all the power in society. And have you considered that maybe feminism got a lot of support because it opened people's eyes to how shitty society was being? As with a lot of leftist movements, the truth conquers prejudice."

We're going about 45, there's a median on one side, sidewalk covered with people on the other, so those aren't options... so we're about to T bone this jackals that's gone ""deer in the headlights"" at the sight of a motorcycle coming towards them. The woman driving the Mazda is just watching us come at her, and of course, there's a kid in the back seat, right where we're about to crunch. My husband is braking for dear life, I'm pressing hard against his back and the low seat between us, I feel us hit, my helmet slams into his... And then nothing. We stopped, we're alive! The front of the bike is smushed into the trunk of the Mazda, there's a horrified little kid looking right at me, and my husband is trying to disentangle himself from the wreckage. 

Everybody was alright. My husband strained his shoulders and arms really badly- the handlebars on the sportster were bent almost all the way backwards (started out in a wide n shape, ended up in a wide u shape). I had some light damage to my leg that the paramedics patched up really quickly. It turned out the driver was an undocumented Dominican lady with no English, trying to learn how to drive by herself. The kid was just excited to meet some bikers. "
redditerrrr,breastfeeding,1390056788.0,"Basically I started switching his daycare bottles over to whole milk then was planning to nurse in the morning and at night. But, wiggle was putting away so much whole milk and solids during the day that he just didn't beg me to nurse like he used to. Then a few mornings in a row he just wanted to play after cereal and I didn't push it. I just let him do his thing and within a few weeks he was completely on whole milk. It seems heavier and more filling so he sleeps like 13 hours a night.

Also, whole milk is poured more freely he gets slightly more, and we also give him all kinds of solids. He tries everything we eat. I think that has been the key. I know he is getting good nutrition from solids so I don't have to stress too much. For me, that has been the secret. He was ""ready"" to wean because he was more interested in solids basically. "

I_Enjoy_Taffy,nba,1390057127.0,"I posted this on /r/bostonceltics, but I'm gonna post it here to show you what I mean:

I've said this in a number of threads on this subreddit, but I am absolutely ok with Rondo being traded, in fact I hope it happens. Here is why:

You cannot win an NBA championship led by a PG. It just doesn't happen nowadays. Chris Paul whom many consider to be the best PG in the league has made it to the Conference Semifinals only 2 times, and has NEVER made the Conference Finals. Derrick Rose has made it out of the Conference Quarterfinals ONCE (not including the year he went down with the ACL tear) and ended up making the Conference Finals. What do these guys have in common? They've never even sniffed the NBA Finals. And why is that? Because if your team revolves around a point guard, you are not going to succeed. If the point guard is a complement to other players then you have something (ex. Westbrook to Durant, Parker to Duncan/Ginobili). But, if your team is point guard centric then it's just going to fail miserably.

In the past 20 years only TWO point guards have won Finals MVP. Tony Parker and Chauncey Billups and neither of those two were the focal point of the team. They were surrounded by great players. Also, these two guys are score-first point guards. That is not Rondo's game, he is a pass-first PG through and through. To succeed in the NBA you need to surround a team around a Forward (LeBron, Durant, Garnett, Duncan) or SG (Kobe), or even a Center if he's that good. The last thing you want to do is surround your team around a point guard.

Look at Steve Nash, he had been the star of the Phoenix Suns for years as THE guy. What did that get him? To the Conference Finals, but never the NBA Finals. He won some MVP awards, but would you rather championships or MVP awards? It just does not happen in this league.

fffangold,DebateReligion,1390057350.0,"Ok, so this isn't an official position of my church (though it's a popular and accepted one), but it's also not just something I came up with. I'm going to copy and paste some info about what we generally believe and some history, and I think that will likely provide the context.  
  
First, are the seven principles of Unitarian Universalism:  
We, the member congregations of the Unitarian Universalist Association, covenant to affirm and promote  
  
* The inherent worth and dignity of every person;  
* Justice, equity and compassion in human relations;  
* Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations;  
* A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;  
* The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large;  
* The goal of world community with peace, liberty and justice for all;  
* Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.  
  
You'll note the above beliefs are centered on how we should live, and intended to be inclusive of all people. Not much is said about the afterlife, because different UU's have different beliefs about this. Some don't even believe in an afterlife (we have atheists, theists, and polytheists among us). However, that inclusiveness is something that informs my belief.  
  
Next, note the sources our religion is based on:  

* Direct experience of that transcending mystery and wonder, affirmed in all cultures, which moves us to a renewal of the spirit and an openness to the forces which create and uphold life;
* Words and deeds of prophetic women and men which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love;
* Wisdom from the world's religions which inspires us in our ethical and spiritual life;
* Jewish and Christian teachings which call us to respond to God's love by loving our neighbors as ourselves;
* Humanist teachings which counsel us to heed the guidance of reason and the results of science, and warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit.
* Spiritual teachings of earth-centered traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature.  
  
You'll note we've basically specified where we pull our beliefs from, and we're looking to find the positive from many different systems. That list isn't exhaustive, but it covers most of the big ones. This is in keeping with our idea of inclusiveness of all people, and the fact that for us, religion is a search for truth, not being told what to believe.

Finally, it's important to understand that we are not a Christian church anymore, though we grew out of the merger of two Christian denominations (Unitarianism and Universalism, hence our name), and certainly welcome Christians who embrace our theology (see the seven principles). Christian Universalists *do* believe that all people go to Heaven, because no loving God would damn someone to an eternity in Hell. Unitarian Christians also believe that the idea of eternal damnation had no place in Christianity, and thought the idea of it maligned God's good name. I think many atheists here can attest to that.

So, I am a part of an inclusive religion that believes all people have a right to search for truth, within the boundaries that we respect other people. It grew out of two Christian denominations who believe God is too good to damn people to Hell, and people are too good to be damned to Hell. As a member who believes in an afterlife, and believes also that we should look for the good in many belief systems, part of that good is that people have a positive place to go after death. I label that as Heaven, as it is the most easily recognized name for it. I'm sure plenty of people have other names for it, but the thing to recognize is that it is a place of joy, happiness, and reuniting with those we knew in life.

So you can see this belief has a solid basis in the history of my church.  That said, I also believed it before joining this church, though I had heard others had similar beliefs."

You know, I couldn't agree more. Don't misinterpret my post as anti-mid-major. It's precisely the opposite. Please make sure you actually understand what I wrote. 

&gt;16 is too much and would make the regular season a joke

It really wouldn't. There would be 11 automatic bids and only five at-large bids. You'd have to be either (a.) a conference champion or (b.) a Top-10 team (at worst) to make it in.

This year, the Big 5 conference champs were #1 FSU, #2 Auburn, #4 Michigan State, #5 Stanford, #6 Baylor. Five other conference champs would have made it, including UCF. That leaves five at-larges, which going strictly by AP ranking, would be #3 Alabama, #7 Ohio State, #8 Missouri, #9 South Carolina. 

The lowest at-large team in this scenario is #9 in the nation. None of the at-large teams had more than two losses.  

The weaker teams would be the weak mid-major conference champions. This is the part of the of the system people will attack most -- but my theory is that this is worth it; the ""conference champion"" allowance gives every unexpected mid-major success a chance to prove themselves in the playoffs. I think this outweighs the downside of a weak conference champion making it in.

&gt;Should a 4 Loss Texas A&amp;M get into the Playoffs?

Placing aside for a moment a 4-loss team who didn't win their conference would not sniff a 16-team playoff, even if it were the case, tradeoffs like this would be a small price to pay to allow a team like UCF to be playing for the national championship."

Westminster sets things like foreign policy. The Scottish Parliament can set things like tax (within a band), education and health policy.

You asked about the legal system - very good question. It's not only the laws which are different, but the legal system itself. Australia, the USA, Canada and so on are under ""Common Law"", inherited from England and also used in Wales. The [Scottish legal system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_law) is separate, and is said to be based on Roman Law (not really accurate, but that's the convention). I'm not really able to summarise the differences, but as an example, there are three common verdicts in a criminal trial - guilty, not guilty, and not proven - rather than the two in a common law trial. I understand that Northern Irish law is different again."

The fact that you realised what was actually important to you was very good sign. Being the sort of person that has that level of control is very useful in life in general.

There are many that buy games because the box art is cool or their friends like the game. Games are entertainment, they're meant to be fun. If you base your decisions on anything else your short-changing yourself.

I almost exclusively look at reviews when picking games, because I don't play many games and I want to make sure I play the best ones first. I look at the scores on metacritic, although I hear gamerankings is pretty good, and look at what scored the best on what platform. There are some really good games that ""only"" scored 80-90% and even less, so you have to balance scores with personal taste. 

It may not be a perfect method but it's the best I've found. I spent most of my youth pouring over gaming magazines, looking for news and previews but ultimately it's a pointless exercise. Why spend hours reading information about a game only for it to get a metacritic score of 74%? It would be easier to buy that game and see for myself rather than spend months following development."

They ARE expensive, but for someone with a lot of guitars, I do not want to be re-stringing more than 2-3 times a year because of how long it takes me to string all the guitars up, and how many sets I need to buy.

I prefer stringing 2-3 times yearly to every 2 weeks which is how quickly normal strings get to the stage where I don't want to play on them anymore (yeah, I'm picky about it) as I despise playing on dead strings.

neutral notes - less about looks and more on durability and function. similar price to naga. slightly bigger than naga, better for full hand mouse users than claw hand players &amp;lt;--(potential bias here).  
  
cons - I can't turn my keyboard into a second one and use them in tandem."

Jrodicon,AskReddit,1390058206.0,"I don't he was, in the start of the video, the third guy about 10 feet to the left of the first two is the one caught in the avalanche. They were skiing together but I can only assume that the first two guys went off to the left and the third guy went more straight down and got caught in the slide. You can just see the white cloud from the avalanche in the video when he's standing on top of the cliff. I read that the guy in the slide and the guy with the helmet cam were actually brothers. But yeah it's a good point you shouldn't ski alone, especially in the backcountry where the avalanche danger is a lot higher. Even just separating for a minute or two like these guys did could be fatal."

Incidentally, NASA should probably adopt this attitude regarding their budget:

ScipiiRye,pcmasterrace,1390058249.0,"&gt; Or DICE could self publish.

They could. They'd have to do a Bungie and buy themselves back from EA though, since AFAIK EA owns them. Also, they'd lose the rights to the Battlefield IP since EA owns that as well.

I wouldn't mind seeing DICE go its own way, or at least be able to act in partnership with EA instead of its obedient slave at the expense of the quality of its products. Frostbite is a solid engine and they've proven themselves to be extremely competent devs.

Can't wait for Battlefront III though, man I hope EA doesn't fuck that up too.

As far as I'm concerned, PUA is just another evolution of being a ""nice guy.""  It's what ""nice guys"" do when they want to try a different approach to ""getting chicks,"" but don't actually want to change themselves.

How do I know?  I've been there.  I was a ""nice guy"" in high school, and I did the whole PUA thing in college.  Thankfully I outgrew both."
