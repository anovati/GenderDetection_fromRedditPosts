bunabhucan,guns,1389193073.0,"I think you are very much on base with respect to what I am talking about. I'm very familiar with the argument.

As an outsider, I also think that the idea that the civilians being capable of taking on this government is at best a fantasy and at worst delusional. Just setting aside the (most powerful on the planet) military, take a look at the law enforcement response to the Boston bomber manhunt. I can't imagine that average Americans, untrained, unfit, unable to communicate in secrecy etc. could come up with much of a response.

The only situation I can think would allow the civilians of this country to take on the government and law enforcement would be if they were completely unified. I'm thinking of a unpopular dictator seizing power today. Given that prerequisite, whether the citizens are armed or not doesn't make much difference to the outcome. If the dictatorship has zero popular support then factions or even all of the army as well as local law enforcement would side with the people.

That situation (an unpopular dictator) seems *really* unlikely, given how the country is set up. A more likely situation would be a civil war type situation, maybe if migrants from Mexico were in majority in border states, Mexico was booming, the US declining and the border states were pushing to secede and join Mexico. Any situation like that, the addition of guns is a wash, both ""sides"" have equal access.

I'm not even going to touch the idea that the political situation today is ""a lot"" like 1776."

Nmom, who also enabled ndad for 15 years of shitty marriage, would NEVER phone me or come to my house so as soon as I moved out of her house at 19 I was automatically LC with her.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389193313.0,"&gt; men's concern should be their general happiness and well being, and that requires putting your ego asides, going out of your comfort zone, and asking girls out.

Why don't women have this concern as well?

To clarify, I'm in a relationship and have no trouble asking women out, so I'm removed from this situation.  I don't think of it as being unfair at all.  If women don't want to ask men out, then that's their prerogative, and I'm totally cool with it.  But if they want to be happy and there's a man that they like, then why not just ask them out?  I'm not saying to turn the tables, I'm just saying I think more women should at least take the option if they want it.

For example, I was helping out a friend with her dating profile, and she starts talking to this guy, wanting him to ask her out.  I have no problem with that, so I gave her advice on how to show that she's interested to make him feel better about (and therefore, more likely to) asking, and he didn't ask.  She told me she's straightforward and hates playing these games...so why not just ask?  I mean, she did in the end, but I think that stigma should be removed.  She wanted to ask, but didn't think she was supposed to.  I just think that's silly. "

Fact: long hair is a sign of health and fertility thus it is a hardwired turn on for men.

&gt; If she can pull it off, it's amazing.

But YOU can't. I've known 30+ girls with the ultra-short pixie (lived in a hipster city for a while). At best, they lost a full point of 0-10 attractiveness -- at worst, they looked like shit. The worst part is that everyone told them how brave and pretty they looked: ""You go girl!"" 
And [this](http://sunshinemaryandthedragon.wordpress.com/2013/11/10/ladies-it-is-older-women-gay-men-and-feminists-who-tell-you-its-great-to-cut-your-hair-short-what-conclusion-can-you-draw-from-that/) may be why. So they all wore the do for enough time to realize they weren't getting dates with attractive guys and then quietly grew it out.

I can think of one, maybe two, girls I know who still looked truly hot with short hair. They were both athletes with smoking hot bodies (under a hundred pounds), the faces of models (with the slight jaw and high cheekbones to pull it off), and eighteen years old. If you're all three of the above ask a stylist if they really think a pixie, or even a bob will look hot on you. Tell them you'll pay for some kind of haircut either way. Don't ask girl friends, coworkers, guys who want your approval -- or anyone. Ask a professional.

If you're in a relationship run this by your man. Yes, you have the right to do whatever the hell you want with your body. He also has the right to do whatever he wants with the relationship if you change your body and he isn't as attracted to you. I've seen this move end relationships plenty of times.

Skyler827,IWantOut,1389193746.0,"Clarification on bitcoin fees: if you have thousands of dollars in a single bitcoin address, you can generally move them for free.  The transaction fees are designed to prevent people from flooding the network with millions of small transfers.

***(all figures are approximate)***

In general, the fee you have to pay is inversely related to (the number of bitcoins in an address) times (the amount of time since those coins have last been spent).  If you have a few bucks in bitcoin, you'll have to wait a year to qualify for a free transaction, but if you wanted to spend them while they were an hour old, you might need to pay 50 cents or a dollar or so in fees.  The same $5 transfer might confirm a few weeks later for ~10 cents worth' or so.  If you have $10,000 in bitcoins, you qualify for a ~$0.001 transaction in the next block (10 mins later) and a free transfer by the end of the day.

The fee also changes as the network grows.  In the beginning, the block reward (new bitcoins being created) was very high and miners were willing to mine all transactions and almost none had to pay fees, but the network was smaller and more vulnerable to a DDoS, so the fee could quickly go very high if you tried to spend too many small bitcoins around.  Today, the block reward is smaller and miners are willing to include a few free transactions in each block, most transactions pay a modest fee, and low priority (young/small) BTC transfers command a higher fee.  In the future, the block reward will be zero, and miners will only earn revenue from fees, so every transaction will need to pay some minimum amount in fees, but low priority (new and small) transfers will be cheaper because the network will be more resistant to DDoS attacks (assuming the hashrate keeps increasing).

TLDR; the fee is complicated."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389193781.0,"This point of view always bugs me, because I hate thinking things have to be set in stone when they shouldn't be.  I mean, I'm not saying every woman has to start asking guys out or even that the majority have to, but I think women should if they want to.  I don't see why they have to abide by whatever is the current standard just because ""society is what it is.""  Change isn't the worst thing in the world, you know.

And I'm not talking about changing overnight or even changing a lot of people's views or choices.  But I don't see why people can't take on a different perspective if they want to.  I posted this elsewhere, but I recently helped a friend out with dating, and she was attempting to bait a guy into asking her out that she was texting with.  She's straightforward and prefers to go for what she wants, but because of comments like yours (also no offense meant), she thought she wasn't supposed to.  I had to convince her that it was okay, and it's better to ask and know where you stand than to wait around if you're the type of person that wants to know one way or the other.

I just think the whole thing is silly.  If a guy likes a girl, we tell him to ask her out.  Just go for it!  No point waiting around for something to happen, go for it, you might miss your chance.  But if a girl likes a guy, we tell her to do what - flirt with him in hopes that he might take the hint and ask her out?  How many missed opportunities occur because of this system?

And this isn't about anything being unfair or about the plight of the shy guy.  I agree that shy guys should learn to deal with those tough situations and to just ask a girl out, but why prevent women from doing the same?  Why not have both?  Does it really have to be one or the other?"

And you might just have to work with a therapist first on things and then talk about medication later. Process why you are so fixated on your teeth when you can potentially maintain other areas of your life.

It honestly sounds like you have a form of OCD. OCD doesn't always mean obsessively clean or organized, it means a lot of things. and people with it almost never get better on their own. Then they get depressed and anxious and it makes it even tougher to treat the original OCD.

Get some help to clear out these things, and then you can work on why you are scared of this particular act. What it means and why it haunts you. If you would feel no shame getting a plumber to help you because a pipe job is just too big, or a contractor to help rebuild your house because you found out one of the walls is not supporting weight like it should, then feel no shame in asking a therapist and psychiatrist to help you put your own ""house"" (i.e - mind) back in order.

i will say, however, that when i am in a serious relationship with another person, i make sure to tell them. i don't tell them because i want to ""keep my options open"" or anything, but because i want the person i am dating to know me, and my sexuality is a big part of who i am (note: its part of my identity, not my identity. as much as being white, a man, or having been raised in Michigan are part of who i am but they don't define who i am.) so, for the woman you are dating, yes, tell her - she deserves to know if you are serious about having a long-term relationship with her. does your family need to know? that's for you to decide. same with your friends. if you are feeling stressed about ""hiding"" this part of yourself, then yes, tell the people you want."

You have to understand that black people are subjected to white beauty standards their entire lives.  A lot of black people are sensitive about their hair in particular because there is a tremendous amount of pressure put on black people, and especially black women, to treat their hair with noxious chemicals, wear wigs, weaves and the like because they get told their natural hair is ugly, nappy, bad and unprofessional.

It's not ""fucking ridiculous"" that they get upset over mockery of their hair.  Black women destroy their hair in an effort to meet white beauty standards of long, straight hair.  You think it's ridiculous, but you don't have that experience. [Read this.](http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/artsandculturewithreese/2009/07/14/the-effects-of-racism-on-black-hair/) It's a big issue with black women.

Try to understand that acknowledging this is racism is not the same thing as saying you're a bad person because you found it funny.

duckface08,canada,1389194213.0,"I agree on both points.

If I'm sick and know how to treat myself (i.e. if I have the flu or a bad cold), then why should I see a doctor? The doctor will just tell me what I already know - get lots of rest, drink lots of fluids, and give it time. Plus, I live alone and have no family nearby, so dragging myself to the nearest clinic while sick isn't an easy task, and I'd feel bad roping a friend into bringing me unless I *really* needed to go. And walk-in clinics around here are notoriously crowded due to a lack of family doctors. I have waited as long as 4-5 hours for a 5 minute visit at a walk-in clinic.

In other words, I feel like I'm wasting the doctor's time if I don't really need to be seen (i.e. if I just needed a note to prove I was sick for my employer). Plus, a lot of doctors charge for writing doctor's notes for sick time; I feel like it's a money-grab and salt on a wound, so to speak. Being part-time, I don't get paid for sick days, so I'm already losing money by not going into work.

Honestly, I think asking for a doctor's note is only reasonable if you're off for more than 3-4 days and/or if you call in sick frequently (i.e. more than 2 instances a year or something like that)."

I clarified that I was required to buy/rent a modem, AS WELL as a router from them, to which they stated ""You will need to buy both from us"".

Was that just stupid untrained tech support telling me that? or am I missing something?

The next bug in the system was a tech was required to come over to install the service for me. I'm more than capable to plug things in and I know my way around a network having worked in Network Administration for many years. I stated I already have dry-loop lines installed from Bell and that I didn't require additional loops, and was happy paying the $5/mo service fees for your service, however they insisted in installing new, additional dry-loop lines. Why? I can understand that since this infrastructure I may not know everything, so I'm willing to accept that this was my lack of education on this.."

&gt;**The event report mirrors what family members told the media.**

&gt;Wilsey said his family called the police to help with his son Keith Vidal who has schizophrenia  and had a small screwdriver in his hand. Officers used a Taser on Vidal and then shot him, according to Wilsey.

&gt;Wilsey said officers came into their home after they called for backup help when Vidal was having a schizophrenic incident.  

&gt;Wilsey said officers had his son down on the ground after the teen was tased a few times and an officer said, ""we don't have time for this."" That's when Wilsey says the officer shot in between the officers holding the teen down, killing his son.

&gt;""There was no reason to shoot this kid,"" Wilsey said. ""They killed my son in cold blood. We called for help and they killed my son.""

&gt;The family said police shot Vidal because he had a screwdriver in his hand. They said it was a tiny screwdriver, though, that would not have hurt anyone. 

&gt;Both parents said they had to watch their son die in front of them. They said Vidal had just turned 18 years old and only weighed about 90 pounds.

&gt;Vidal's mother, also at the scene, said she could not understand what happened.

&gt;""Where is the justice, why did they shoot my son?,"" she asked. ""This is what's wrong with our mental health system.""

&gt;According to David, investigators responded to the scene immediately and began working as a team to start gathering evidence. The district attorney said investigations area a search for the truth, and he's confident that everyone involved will find the truth.

&gt;The family said they recently lost their daughter in a car accident and this is the second child they will have to bury.

&gt;Neighbors said Vidal played with their children and he never was violent.  They said he had a history of depression and schizophrenia, but he was never harmful to others.

&gt;Vidal's mother said she had tried multiple times to get Vidal help for his mental illness. Emergency services treated her for a breakdown at the scene.

I'd say take this opportunity to reach out, get to know her, and see what is there.  bring it up to your b/f, ""Hey Pookiebear babycakes sweetums. I know you are close with this girl, so I would like to get to know her as well.  I trust you and know she's a lesbian, but if she's important to you, then I'd like to try and be friendly, if not friends, with her.  It does make me a little uneasy how much time you spend with her, but I'm thinking it's just because she's a stranger, and you and I were apart for so long.  So what would be something we could do to spend time all together?""

This lets him know you're a little uneasy but realize she's not a threat, and that you are trying to work through everything because you are recognizing his needs.  At the same time, this should help relax you a bit, and maybe you can find that things aren't as bad as they seem"

Ridiculous. I have never understood why people tip based on cultural expectation and not the service they receive. If anything, start at 10% tip and go up or down from there based on service. That's it.

I posted this a while back, it is pertinent here:

For people who havn't been waiters, and don't know about this law: If a waiter gets paid $2 an hour base, and that waiter doesn't make up the difference in that $2 and at least minimum wage, then the business has to front the rest of the money to bring it up to a minimum wage average over their hours. So if they work 10 hours and only make $20, the company is obligated legally to make up the difference in that $20 and the amount they would have made with minimum wage base pay. Link at bottom of post.

Like it or not, and I have been a waiter so I know this is true, a lot of waiters love to complain about tips even though the problem isn't that serious. Any waiter worth their salt will be able to make, at any restaurant that has moderate foot traffic, well over minimum wage on average. The ones who don't, I have found through personal experience, are either lazy (don't want to refill drinks, leave customers hanging around waiting for checks, etc) or they just aren't good at their job (not everyone is cut out for that line of work). Tips and gratuity are supposed to be based on service. They are not supposed to be mandatory. Do people abuse this occasionally? yeah. But the vast majority don't. The vast majority will drop 20% on that line regardless of the service they got. A lot of waiters abuse that fact and do less work, expecting they will get the tip regardless. A lot of times they will get it regardless.

I guess the bottom line is, waiters and waitresses have nothing to complain about. Everyone has to pay taxes. That's just how it is. Why should waiters and waitresses be excused from that? If that was the case, every service industry should start working on a ""tip"" basis just to get out of having to pay taxes.

I am fully expecting to be downvoted for this opinion. But not everyone is a starving single mother of two who is putting their way through graduate school while working at dennys. A lot of waiters and waitresses aren't bad people, they just think they have some inherent right or privilege because they are taking your order. In a perfect world, they would have to split their tips with the cooks in a lot of places. Why? because a lot of times, people will tip based on the quality of their food as well, and that has nothing to do with who sets it down on your table. Or how about when you order a mixed drink from your table? The bartender makes it. He doesn't see much of that tip (most places he sees exactly none of it).

Sources: I have worked in the industry as a waiter, cook, and bartender.

Source for anyone who cares about the law. I would really like to note: a lot of people in the US have this insane false perception about how waiters get paid. The fact of the matter is, they arent going to starve if they get $0 tips. In fact, they will make out exactly the same as everyone else working entry level jobs. You hear this all the time: ""Tips are how they make their money. We have to tip"". Someone usually says this when you get a particularly bad waiter/waitress and would rather not even tip at all. That statement is wrong. They will get paid regardless. And tipping is supposed to be based on service received.

Edit: To stem any confusion: part of this was in regard to a question of whether gratuity was taxed or not."

bdto711,GlobalOffensive,1389194578.0,"I started waaaay back at beta 2/3 when I was 13/14 I think. At that age I was playing a lot and I got very good at the game. I missed out on the competitions simply because of my age and I didn't really know much about competitive gaming. Online wise, I trialed with B!TCH who I think became 4Kings but by then I'd hardly be playing.

In my experience,and this is only online experience, the amount of time playing set me apart as I could easily run around and have my crosshair in the position I just knew would be an enemy's head. Having ISDN at the time helped as well. I would imagine it's the same for pro players, they just know what angles to play the map at then their aim + reflexes but them over the edge. 

I've started playing more in the last few months and being able to play with people I used to back then just makes it much more enjoyable. I have good memories and enjoy making new ones now so it's the teammates rather than the game that has kept me playing for around 15 years."

IAMTHEDEATHMACHINE,minnesotavikings,1389194693.0,"I would offer up the following counterpoints:

1. Switching to a 3-4 would require a massive personnel overhaul. Moreso than continuing with the 4-3. In my opinion, we're missing a NT and MLB. The MLB of the future might even be on our team already. As for CBs, you can always use more talent there, regardless of scheme. But I think we're only a few key pieces away from a *good* 4-3. 

2. 4-3 ≠ Tampa-2. In fact, Zimmer ran a successful 4-3 in Cincy that wasn't a Tampa-2.

3. Our offense scored a lot of points this year. A lot. And they also made a lot of mistakes. But for all of the offense's mistakes, they still did their job. Our defense was pathetic. If we had been able to hold opponents to 24 or less points, we probably would have been in the 10-6 range. Maybe better.

4. Defensive head coach + good OC = great team. Zimmer would probably bring Hue Jackson as his OC. Jackson worked miracles with the Raiders and I think he could get the most out of our talent on offense. 

I'm not anti-Gruden, but I think Zimmer has produced better results with what he's been given."

'To the Victor goes the spoils'.  That is the way shit works.  

This was a War after all.  Should they have just said, ""Hey we invaded your country and and got to the capitol.  We'll leave you guys alone now!"" ?  Plus we never occupied mainland Japan during WWII, we just dropped bombs on them.  It took TWO A-Bombs for them to decide to surrender....

We won, they surrender and make reparations and consolations for dragging us into this protracted war.  There is absolutely nothing wrong or abnormal about that.  It's called strategy also, when you keep a base in a country after kicking their ass.  This has all been to their benefit mind you as well.  Trade partners and military allies with the US is a good thing for them.  

Also remember that Russia was our ally during WWII and was also at the negotiating table when the surrenders took place, it wasn't just us asking the Japanese to give back conquered lands.  This was also in part to avoid another conflict with Russia trying to get it back militarily.

In addition you must recall that the US tried to stay out of WWII but it was Japan that dragged us into it.  So they have to make some deals and have a base in their country?  Big deal!"

mmp31,politics,1389194827.0,"Minimum wage only temporarily raises the payrate of minimum wage workers. There's a reason that engineers make X amount of times the amount of money that minimum wage workers make. It's because that's what the market has determined their labor is worth relative to each other, using our pricing structure to describe the labor values in absolute terms. The same goes for any job relative to another.

No amount of raising the minimum wage is EVER going to change the real relative labor values. What it does do, however, is distort the pricing structure until it (somewhat) recovers from government abuse. Eventually the wages of higher earners will go up and minimum wage earners will be making the same amount of money compared to the higher income groups as they were before.

Anybody who supports raising minimum wage is just jerking off because they don't want to address the real problem, which is inflation. Since the minimum wage increase in 2009, prices have gone up 9%, which means that the poor have seen a decrease in their income of 9%. For people who can barely feed themselves, that is SIGNIFICANT.

Locking minimum wage to inflation is a non-solution, because it will not change the fact that the poor's wages will be devalued until minimum wage goes up again. If one really cares about the poor, they would demand that the government immediately abolish inflation, which is controlled entirely by the Federal Reserve. Then we won't have to worry about rising prices harming the poor."

Is he pushing himself to prove his value to the coaching staff?  Are Megatron and Suh playing to prove their worth?  Probably not.  What message does that send to the next tier of players?  What message does that send to the 54th guy on the roster who thinks he can play better than an established vet?

You know how Belichick treats Brady?  He coaches him as hard as anyone on the roster?  You know how Carroll won the Seahawks over?  He skipped the QB with the big contract and started the undersized hungry rookie who earned the job in camp.

You will need to discuss the boundaries of your relationship with your partner and come to an agreement. If your boundaries are too different and you cannot come to an agreement, then you may be incompatible as partners.

For some people, even having sex with other partners isn't cheating. For others, holding hands is cheating. Even if something isn't cheating, it can still also be inappropriate. Within my relationship, holding hands would generally be considered inappropriate unless you were leading the person somewhere, trying not to be separated in a crowd, one of you is falling and the other is catching you, or something else totally non-romantic.

zen_music,HomeImprovement,1389194900.0,"This really isn't the season for this kind of repairs.  I'm trying to imagine something you could do as a temporary fix until the weather improves and you could expect sealants to properly cure, to keep from continuing to destroy your roof's plywood and the living room ceiling. Temporary sealants applied around all edges of the drain up on the roof may help; check to see if the fixture is cracked also, caulk if needed.  That roof tar you showed is terrible stuff to try to remove, and is not really a permanent repair. There are similar things not so difficult to handle. Talk to the guys at the hardware store. 

Also,  not to make you feel bad-  since that has clearly been wet for a while,  once it's fixed and dries the plywood may require some bolstering from underneath,  with a plywood sheet to patch and reinforcing across between rafters (2x4 or something) because plywood (or any wood) that has been wet like that and then dries is subject to dry rot,  which sucks out the strength of the fibers.  It's not like the roof is about to fall in, but six or eight years from now,  the real supportive power of that area will surely be compromised.   

The same process should be expected within the affected truss (roof support framing)  but unless you have mold set in,  most likely the damage will not be great enough to really put anything at risk.  Wouldn't hurt to nail on 'companion' framing along the top of the truss (called ""partnering"") of new wood while you're fixing; 2x4s and some nails are cheap by comparison with taking it apart and starting over.

ANewMachine615,conspiracy,1389194917.0,"&gt;After the Civil War (after emancipation), a lot of large land-owners deeded out substantial tracts of land to their former slaves. These former slaves had demonstrated to their masters that they were loyal, hard-working, and would continue to farm and contribute to the plantation collective as they always had. The only difference is that they would own the land they worked, and earn a somewhat larger income as a result of their efforts.

See? They were super-nice to their former slaves! They magnanimously gave out land to the loyal ones, because suddenly they'd become fair and right-minded with the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. And now they'd be earning ""a somewhat larger income"" (which I guess is possibly true, given that the slaves were previously earning exactly $0 for their efforts).

&gt;During reconstruction, a lot of land holders, both black and white, had difficulty paying very high property taxes imposed by Federal Occupiers

Damned gummint making the South pay for the war the South started!

&gt;In swept speculators and investors from up North (these people have come to be known as “Carpet Baggers”.) They often forced white land owners to sell out at a fraction of the actual value of their property. In the case of black land-owners, sometimes all the Carpet Baggers offered was threats. The effect was the same – a vast transfer of wealth from titled property owners to new people who became, in the decades of the late 19th and early 20th century, among the wealthiest people in the South.

*True* Southerners aren't the modern Southern elite, and they weren't responsible for the theft and disenfranchisement of blacks in the post-Reconstruction era. That's just those damned northern elite carpetbaggers."

Well, turns out, we still weren't compatible.  We split up again, but we didn't really invest anything into each other this time, so it really wasn't a big deal.  I didn't even flinch - it was just ""oh, that's over now,"" and that was that."

1) You will not get jacked from any exercise unless you deliberately plan on getting jacked. Spending an hour at the gym 5 times a week will simply not do that. It's just not how it works.


2) Working out + getting fit sucks. IT SUCKS. I have been into fitness all of my life and it sucks. You know what it sucks the most? The first few months of working out. You gotta chip at it though. This attitude of ""If I don't like it, I won't be able to stick to it"" needs to change. You don't like it? Tough. Stick with it. Make it a daily appointment for yourself. You might not like the actual workout, but you will like what it does for you after; just stick it out despite actually hating it. 



3) You didn't get out of shape in 6 months, you won't get into shape in 6 months.  



4) Introvert ay? So is almost everyone else in the gym. We aren't all star athletes. We aren't winning gold medals. We aren't looking at each other. When I go to the gym or a yoga class; there can be 1 other person or 50 other people. My eyes are square on what I am doing. Everyone else? They are more concerned about their work out than what you look like, and what you are doing. 


5) CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH: you will not put on huge muscles unless that is your intention. no one accidentally puts on a lot of muscles. Look at those weight lifters! Look at those guys in the gym! Do those guys look like they accidentally got big? No!!! They put in hours every day every week and years into that. They dedicated their lives to it. Going an hour for 5 days a week, even to lift weights will not get you ripped. That comes from diet, lifestyle, and hours of work. 



6) I noticed in of your comments you said you can only commit ~3 classes per week? How much time can you commit on a week to actual fitness? 3 days a week will not get you fit. You get fit when you put in the work on a consistent basis. 3 days per week is not consistency. It is a good step, but it wont get you fit. When I was a student, I worked 40 hours a week and still volunteered with a cat rescue. I still found time to work out. Yes you get bombed with work, but you have to find those 40-60 minutes to just unleash everything physically. You have time to watch TV? You have time to work out then. No time is just an excuse. 


7) That said, yoga is still a phenomenal activity and worth looking into and trying.

The Rundown: I dress up often, wearing a button-down or even a sportcoat. When I'm dressed down I wear a white v-neck tucked into a fitted pair of informal khakis, an interesting belt, and simple leather shoes or boots. 

I began this for weekend parties etc. because I had the shirts for wearing under formal button-downs anyway and am sick of jeans being everyone's answer for any outfit.

I've lost track of how many times girls have told me how well ""my style"" accentuates that v-shape, my pecs, or my hips and ass (yes, women are attracted to asses, do kettlebell swings). I have also had many men tell me how manly I look (often drunken confessions when I'm D.D.ing etc) but that they don't think they could pull of the white t-shirt etc.

The long and short of it: Fuck style. Pick a personal style that works for you. It will become your signature and people (women especially) will recognize it and thus you.

If you want to tuck in your shirt: 1. keep your BMI low and your waist narrow, bulk the shoulders to get that v-shape. 2. Buy pants that fit! Not skinny jeans, but pants that are fitted through the waist, seat, and thigh. Avoid the pleated fronts until you have at least three grandkids.

Bonus: If you're not an NFL coach tuck in the polo at your own risk. NEVER tuck in any sweater."

Some sort of refrigerator is a big, big help. If you haven't a refrigerator, you can get by with just ice. A cooler would be best, but if you haven't got that either get some boxes and styrofoam. Sometimes you can get some free packing peanuts, and they will work great for this. You can wash out styro cups and crush them to bits, too, if that's all you have. 

You want one large box and and one a little smaller that fits within. Fill the space between the two with the styro. If you've got some duct tape, tape it neatly and make sure you make a lid insulated with styro. It will probably work best if you line it with a couple of trash bags, one inside the other. Now all you need is ice and you've got a cool enough place for storing a few necessary items. 

Of course, not everything requires being placed in the fridge. Eggs, butter, and hard cheeses can all be kept outside as long as the room is cool.

Moving on to what to make, there are many foods that you can purchase in a dry form like pasta. You should be able to bring water to boiling in the microwave, add it in with the pasta in a heavy container or bowl with a lid, and let it set until ready to eat. This works especially well with thin spaghetti. I usually toss a kitchen towel over the bowl to help hold the heat in. If you buy spaghetti sauce in a glass jar which I assume they still sell, you can just pour it over the top.

As to the slow cooker, you can cook so many things in that. Even bread. Probably the next purchase after the slow cooker ought to be an electric skillet or hot plate. "

Zygomatico,changemyview,1389195122.0,"Your view of advertising is a common one. It states that ads are manipulative, and that they only serve to sell a product. Any good product should be able to sell itself.

The problem with this is that it's a limited view. Where I'm from claims of ""This product is the best"" need to be substantiated with facts. Tests need to be done in order to prove this. If you claim that your product is the best without anything backing it up (and one person claiming it is the best isn't nearly enough) this is called false advertising. If your company is found guilty you have to withdraw the ad and often pay a fine. So, claiming something is the best needs to be substantiated in some manner.

Next, good products DO NOT sell themselves. The problem is this: you can't choose something you're unaware of. When we make a buying decision there are 5 basic groups of products. The first is all products in the category. For example, if I'm buying a car then this group contains all possible car brands and makes. Then you get the awareness set: all the products I'm aware of. Out of 15 brands, I might only know 10. So this already limits my options. Then you get the evoked set: all the products I can remember at that point. Out of 10, I might remember 8. The other 2 are in the inert set, brands the customer knows of but couldn't remember at that point. Finally, you have the consideration set, which might be 4 products, the products that are relevant to your decision. The other 4 are in the inept set, brands you don't consider for your decision.

So this means that out of a possible 15, we consider only 4 in the end. There are 5 other brands in the category that we're unaware of. The question then is: how would these brands have factored into our decision had we been aware of it? We don't know, because we don't know the brands. Maybe they're brilliant, exactly what we need. Maybe all five would've been better options than the 4 we considered in the end. However, we don't know because we are unaware of these brands.

That's the use of advertising. They make you aware of products, they help you figure out what is available and how to make sense of them all. You don't make better decisions through not knowing these brands. You make lousy decisions if brands don't tell you what they represent. 

Also, this framework shows why your reasoning of ""we remember them because they have a large advertising budget, not because they're the best"" isn't a good attack on advertising. Yes, we remember them because of their advertising budget, but we don't make a choice based on everything we remember. We narrow it down several times before making a decision. At the end of the day we create a group from which we make a choice based on advertising, but we choose based on each product's merits.

And, finally: manipulative advertising, as stated before, is often illegal. Misrepresenting the truth, outright lying, that's terribly illegal. At least, in most countries I'm aware of. Also, it doesn't work. When we make a decision to buy, afterwards we evaluate the purchase depending on our initial expectations. If expectations were raised too high, we're disappointed in the brand and it's unlikely we'll purchase from them again. The only proper outcome is when you represent your brand honestly, or if consumers are aware of the actual image of your brand."

Feeling_Of_Knowing,askscience,1389195187.0,"I can't answer directly to that, but studying schizophrenia will help us understand the difference.

Some patient are affected with [""auditory verbal hallucinations""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination) and there is a [lot of work](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=auditory+verbal+hallucination) done on them. To summarize, we study in fMRI the ""activation"" (or ""deactivation"") of some area of the brain during the hallucination. This way, we know what structures are activated when we cannot differentiate inner/outer voice (during hallucination), and when we can (control condition). 

We know that many structures play a role during these : [inferior frontal gyri, the ventral striatum, the auditory cortex, the right posterior temporal lobe, and the cingulate cortex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768657/).

To summarize : 

- **pregenual and posterior cingulate cortex** : attribution (self-generated or not)

- inferior frontal gyri : speech comprehension, production of inner speech

- auditory complex : speech and ""loudness"" of the speech

- middle anterior cingulate cortex and the right posterior temporal lobe : agency

- Striatum : salience of internal representation

dunnoyabassa,INTP,1389195281.0,"i suppose what confuses me is this:  why are you interested in guys who are too boring to keep you engaged in conversation?

on my read, the theme of your question appears to be this:  how can i get people to be interested in me when i'm not interested in them?

the fact of the matter is bored people tend to be offputting because they inherently demand something of you.  they non-verbally assert, ""it is on you to amuse me in order to make me amicable and socially graceful.""

you see most people assume a certain level of conversational engagement to be basic politeness.  when engaged in small talk it is neither fake nor deeply authentic of me to say ""wow that's cool that you work in OEM engineering,""  it is simply well-mannered to acknowledge that another's profession is a valid way to spend one's time, whether or not I personally would choose to do the same.  while i understand and follow what you mean when you speak of girls exaggerating their interest to a ridiculous extent, it doesn't seem to me like there's no middle ground between desperate self-flinging and overt disinterest.

here's the thing: a full on display of your honest opinions (verbal or nonverbal) does not equate to respect.  assuming that it does implies that your personal opinions are the most important part of a two person conversation, and as you've noticed this mindset doesn't usually work out well.  consider the fact that everybody else is busy living their life and doesn't owe you an entertaining story in exchange for your manners.  i'm not saying you have no right to feel that they do, but if this is your mindset and accompanying behavior, don't start asking where all your admirers are."

Serae,AskMen,1389195343.0,"I didn't meet my biological father until I was 14.  I didn't really feel my family was missing anything when I met him so I didn't have much in terms of expectations.  Maybe a new friend?

My mother had brought me to a child support hearing as a way to try to get more money (she was a real winner, that one /s).  He and I chatted for a few minutes and basically we talked about hobbies.  Turns out he and I shared hobbies the rest of my family did not which was neat.  

He asked if I wanted to go to the Renaissance Faire with him sometimes (which I love).  I was down with it and my mother joined us.  My mom made it very weird because she hated him.  His wife was calling constantly to cause drama because she felt threatened by him spending time with me.  The event was pretty fun though, and I hoped we would keep in touch.

We had made plans to meet up for coffee around Christmas.  I was excited because I got him a gift of my favorite book.  He never came, never called back, but he left a gift on my porch around New Years.  He got me some of the coolest things I was ever given (Age of Empires which was my first PC game, an awesome fossil of a fish, museum tickets with bus passes...)  I never got to give him his gift which stayed wrapped for a few Christmas holidays before I regifted it.

To be honest, I was a little hurt, but I had already grown up without a father.  Nothing had really changed when he stopped coming around.  I realized it was probably a combination of his wife being controlling and my mother being unbearable.  I don't blame him for not wanting to get to know me anymore.  Relationships are complicated after all.

I think a healthy attitude to have is to go in hoping for make a new friend, but not expecting any sort of monumental void to be filled.  My experience could have been really disheartening but it turned out ok.  I never made an attempt to contact him again.  I am easy to find online.  If he ever wanted to get in contact, that would be fine with me, but I don't have any strong desire to have him around either."

I don't know why you have been upvoted so much because what you said here is factually inaccurate.  The Federal Reserve is 100% responsible for inflation because they have total control over the size of the money base.  If the rate of change of the money supply is greater than the rate of change of the size of the economy, you will have price inflation.  It's really that simple.

When you understand what causes inflation, it puts the problem completely into focus, as well as the solution.  But then again, I'm talking to people who think that we can change the basic laws of supply and demand by passing a law."

Women are the gatekeepers of sex. Men are the gatekeepers of commitment.

A man who is constantly ""friendzoned"" gives up commitment freely without getting sex in return. He will become unattractive in the eyes of most women because they assume there's a reason he always is denied sex. Is there a chance he just likes being friends with women? Absolutely. But this is hardwired biology and the women can do nothing to change these feelings.

A woman who is perceived as promiscuous loses long term relationship value in the eyes of men. Why? Because they subconsciously assume there's a reason she was unable to turn sex into commitment in the past. Could she just be an empowered woman who knows what she likes? Hell yeah. But can guys change this hardwired response? Nope.

atrain728,civ,1389195658.0,"It sounds like you've got more BNW time than I do - I only picked it up around Christmas this year. I've got about 300 hours in Civ V, but a lot of above is experience learned from making a similar transition when coming from Civ 2/3 into Civ 4 - which I think lessened the learning curve in Civ 5.

So, qualifying statement out of the way: When you run out of things to build in your science city, and you've satisfied all the requirements for building *other* national wonders (market, etc) I basically do what you do - build any free improvements, bank, walls, etc. I suppose it goes without saying, but part and parcel with any science city is increasing it's size - so granary, aqueduct, water mill are absolutely worth the gold here. And, to that point, since your limiting factor is probably happiness - happiness buildings. A coliseum should pay for itself in allowing for growth, and I think that follows for all the happiness buildings.

Beyond that? Build wonders, archaeologists, science, military - whatever you want. I don't run into that problem too often, as my science cities are usually pretty low production. Unless it's my capital, but I try to *not* make it my capital. Not because my Cap is a bad science city, but because it's too easy to be distracted.

But you mention a problem with gold, so I'd address that separately. Your buildings can certainly be a drain on your economy, but a well laid empire will still have an enormous surplus of gold. And that comes down to, in my opinion, a terrific financial city. For me, the goal is this: Find a coast line with some decent resources and build a city. Before I build anything else there, I'm building cargo ships (to my trade limit) and a couple of triremes to protect them. This is usually my third city, but sometimes my second. Once I'm maxed on cargo ships, Market, Fishing boats, light house, etc. If I can get the great lighthouse or colossus built, so much the better: I'll prioritize it if the timing's right. In that city, obviously granary and workshop are key for helping to set up other cities you might found along the coast.

With 4+ trade routes pulling in 12+ gold a piece, an EIC, Bank, Market you can easily pull 150 gold from that city. It's enough gold that you'll be fielding a small navy just to protect your trade routes, and if/when your routes get plundered you wont even waste time to build a new cargo ship - the gold to buy a cargo ship outright pays itself back in no time.

Again, this *can* be your capital, but I prefer it not to be - same reason as above: Your capital is easily distracted on long projects like wonders; these cities need to be focused. Making this city inland is viable,operating purely on caravans, but on the coast is where the real money is in my opinion.

Finally, when conquering an enemies capital - for me these cities I focus on them just sustaining themselves: Building happiness and gold; any science is a bonus. If it's got some wonders or some purpose that is evident from it's stats, I might focus on that. I'll also happily build some units here. But first and foremost, I make sure it's self-sufficient.

Also, I wouldn't struggle too much to feel like those cities have a purpose in the same way. If you're out conquering, my assumption is you've already got your base of specialized cities set up. Which I take to mean you know where each national wonder is going. If you don't, then you might consider making a conquered city your financial or science or culture or GP hub. Otherwise, just make sure it's overall a benefit to your civilization. But first and foremost, I make sure it's a benefit to your civilization in every category: freshly conquered, it's definitely not."

cwolfe,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,1389195690.0,"There is a great line in one of my recovery books that says the program is for those who have no other choice and their own enlightened self-interest must tell them that. Many of us reached out for drugs/sex/alcohol/food to cope with what we couldn't handle without them. They worked really well for a time. They fixed what was wrong with us. Then they became worse than the initial problem (depression, anxiety, bi-polar, abuse, etc) yet we couldn't let go of them and find healthy ways to deal with the issues that lead us to them in the first place. Rock and a hard place.

Then we hit bottom which leads us to quit and face our demons which we are no better prepared for than we were when we started on the road to addiction. That is a necessary but shitty place to be. Facing the issues without coping mechanisms is as hard and dangerous as it ever was. The only thing that gets many of us (certainly myself) from that spot to some degree of balance then finally to independence and joy is the 12 step program. I would not have stopped using the coping mechanisms I found (drugs/alcohol/sex in my case) unless they led to a worse place than what got me using them to begin with. Abuse/anxiety/adhd and all around not fitting in for me. Unless or until you get there it seems to me you are asking a bunch of people who have no choice about their course of action to suggest choices to you that they aren't able to make use of. It is like asking double amputees the best way to use crutches/wheel chairs when you just want to not walk so much because you get tired."

The fact that if a guy does something feminine or is more feminine in general is considered ""degrading"" is a thing.

The fact that wrinkly old men are deciding on women's reproductive rights in the US, Australia (and many other countries) is a thing.

The fact that rape culture is a thing that 99% affects girls and women.

The fact that transphobia, homophobia, misogyny, misandry, etc. is a thing.

The fact that ""mens rights activism"" is a thing.

The best wrestling show is the one where everyone has a place. When you have a super realistic vision in mind the goofy stuff will stick out like a sore thumb. Either your audience will pop and won't stop talking about it when you try to do real stuff (Colt Cabana opposed to hybrid style wrestling) or they will completely be alienated (""Addicted to Love"" Rhett Titus 2008).

Lost_Afropick,AskReddit,1389196078.0,"All based on the premise that a war is being fought.  It isn't.  What we have now is an occupation in some places and violation of ""friendly"" airspace in others.

In a war, obviously notions of honour and conduct are (to some extent) stupid.  I say to some extent because conventions mean we don't use gas, poisons and there are codes governing treatment of POWs and so on.  But in terms of how you go about killing armies be it by infantry with guns or ships kilometres away firing missiles or drones, that's all war.  That countries should use their technological superiority to lower the cost to their own is a no brainer.  Of course they should.  In a war.  

But the US is not at war with anybody right now.  But they're (and others like UK) using drones to assassinate targets in supposedly friendly countries like Pakistan.  This isn't war so the war argument is irrelevant.  When a drone takes out a wedding party or a goat herding teenager in this context, the video game arguement is perfectly valid.  It's easier for us, removed in the west to deal with the green screen grainy image in fuzzy pixels, than actually look at mangled bodies of children and civilians.

He doesn't want to completely bend over backwards for the team at his own expense by voluntarily taking a pay cut, but he wants to try and earn the money he's making.

Also the first conclusion would not be ""there's something wrong with him"" [mentally ill], it could on the other hand be ""this person is excessively aggressive, and that is why you should block his number and get a restraining order"" (if you were so inclined).

4redditthings,intj,1389196496.0,"For starters, I'd like to point out that believing in God doesn't make one Christian. 

I see God just as something that's there. My ideas were helped in part with the idea that billions of people can't be wrong, but they also can't be right because billions more disagree.

Imagine creating a terrarium, and then just leaving it in a box of one way glass. The things inside have no idea how they got there, but they are sure that they want to know why. 
Half of them believe someone put them there, and go on content with believing that. The other half believe they were put there by chance, and seek to prove it. In the process of proving it, it was determined that their terrarium exists because it evolved to work that way. Both would be right in their own sense.

I don't believe there is a God, I believe there could be a God and he wouldn't want us to know. Being a God, he could make it impossible for us to know. Like programming a computer not to known it's a computer.

What does this entail? Nothing. Fuck yeah science, and God, if you're out there, kudos for making science. The end. 

I know science exists, and I know that I don't know if God exists. It's all speculation from there.

Edit for the concept of Heaven:

I don't believe anyone who says they know there is a Heaven. No one knows what happens after we die, and I am 100% brain activity on the subject of death. After the brain stops, we die. After that? Hell if I know, and hell if you 'know' without giving me evidence."

Serae,AskMen,1389196639.0,"When looking to date someone I think finding someone with the same or similar sexual morals is entirely relevant.  When I started dating I had to learn my feelings about this.  I personally did not want to be with someone who did not put the same emotional value on sex as I did.  There was never a set turn off number but I knew when I was uncomfortable.

I was briefly dating a friend in high school who had slept with over 30 women by the time he was 18.  I was uncomfortable with it but decided to just see where things went.  His pressure for wanting sex was a little bit to much for me.  I equated sex with love and he equated sex with a just having a good time.  Neither of us were wrong, but we wanted different things.  It was not so much that he'd slept around a lot, but that he was imposing his sexual expectations on me with little respect.  So our short relationship ended.

I would only frown at the situation where someone rejected another person due to promiscuity if they were promiscuous themselves.  :/  Pot calling the kettle black as all.  

Starting a relationship with someone is based on many factors.  I doubt that this one reason is the only one OP's friend had for not dating this person.  Either why, no one is obligated to date anyone based on anything."

If I get poor service (no drink refills, waiter doesnt write down order and it gets messed up, waiter wont give me the time of day, waiter acts entitled) then I will tip as low as 0%. 

And If I get exceptionally poor service, I always report it to the manager. Because that could have a negative impact on their business and someone in charge needs to know about it.

Edit: I'd like to note. I never make picky orders. Taking my order and bringing it to me is not an ordeal, so if I get bad service, it is not because I made a ton of specific requests. If I had specific requests, my tip would go up simply because it is extra work (though, to be fair, regardless what/how I order it should fall within the waiters job description)."

Pro wrestling (in the original sense) is a hyper athletic forward moving soap opera with intense dramatics and a set story. 

Cornette was trying to go for option two. In option two, the comedy wrestlers were only ever top guys who moved merch. You couldn't ever see them lose or you'd risk losing the audience. You can't book that character in that style.

Gertiel,slowcooking,1389196938.0,"I've had good luck using frozen meat in my slow cooker, but I only set it to start two to two-and-a-half hours after I leave. From trying to thaw chicken breasts to cook on the grill, I know they won't be thawed or even close in that time. I'm thinking if you put everything into the cooker at night in the fridge, except the meat, you might be able to get a little longer. Stoneware like the crock holds the cold pretty fair, and the meat would be placed in it frozen solid. I think it might be better with a larger piece of meat like a roast, which takes an extra long time to thaw. 

As far as leaving the cooker on when you aren't home making you nervous, I understand. I have been laughed at because I get out a big roasting pan and set the crock pot in that even if I am just outside working in the yard. I put it on top of the stove for extra safety just figuring a metal stove is much less likely to burn should it come down to it. I also always make sure it is pulled out to the front edge not under the wooden cabinets. I don't figure they cause fires vary often due to the lower temperatures, but placement on the stove also makes it so I can have it out far enough to keep from steaming my upper cabinets while keep the thing firmly sitting on all four feet."

InfinitelyThirsting,AskWomen,1389197005.0,"It's not a character trait, it's choices. Someone can choose to have casual sex, or choose not to. Someone can't *choose* to be shy, and a shy person can't suddenly *choose* to be smooth and outgoing. Much like someone can't *choose* to be tall, but they do choose whether or not they get blackout drunk, and they choose whether or not they have or are seeking a job. 

""Outgoing"" has nothing to do with how often you go out, it's about how friendly and socially confident you are. You should learn what words mean before you use them.

Also, it isn't sex-shaming to call out people who are being sex-shaming. I don't know how you're getting that idea, it's insane.

No one is telling them they can't have preferences; just that no, you don't get to have preferences without being judged for them. Like, if someone prefers to not date black people, that's fine, but the fact that they are free to date whomever they choose doesn't change the fact that it is a racist preference.

I think you're a little too stuck on the fact that people *can* have whatever preferences they want. Yes, they can. But if it's a bigoted, hypocritical preference, then no, it doesn't deserve respect. Yes, people do need reasons; preferences don't magically appear out of nowhere. Because if you are *rejecting someone* for whatever your preference is, it isn't just a preference, it's something mandatory for you. A preference is just ""a greater liking for one thing over the alternatives""; like, I prefer dark hair, but I've never based my decision to date someone on their hair colour. 

If an active drinker only wants to date teetotalers, yes, that's hypocritical. If someone is a golddigger and seeking someone with a career so they don't have to work, yes, that's awful and hypocritical. If a guy breaks up with a girl because he finds out she dated a black guy once upon a time, he's a goddamn racist; if he does the same thing even though he dated a black girl for a while, then he's a racist *and* a hypocrite."

monochromatic0,Games,1389197029.0,"So I will explain to you what I think happens. Wargame Airland Battle came out around may last year, having +800 units and an updated engine that had new capabilities (PLANES, for the obvious example), but the game was completely different as a result. The whole game is different than EE, even if it superficially looks similar. You can't simply upgrade an engine with new capabilities via a patch that easily.

Since then, Eugen released two free DLCs that added around 20 units and around 8-10 new maps. Free. Also, many many patches for balancing, bug fixing and additional language support. 

Now look at Red Dragon. It won't probably come before may as well, and it will add far more than just reskins. 

5 new nations (technically 6, but Australia and New Zealand will be together and count as one), having around +1300 units; 

The AI will be upgraded and will be able to play with any deck it is given, including custom made decks;

There will be naval combat, including big ships with more than 3 weapons, and amphibious units, a first for Wargame as well;

There will be completely new maps based on Asia instead of Europe;

Planes will release flares (only cosmectic, representing ECM, but still nice);

There will be Infantry Command units for the first time;

The concept of Coalitions will be introduced;

The Campaign will be supposedly much bigger, with a dozen scenarios to play;

The Timeframe will be updated to cover units released until 1991-2. 

Do you really think all of the above can be just ""patched in"" as DLC? There are AI overhauls, engine capability additions, a whole new mechanic of naval warfare and more than 500 new units. Isn't that enough for a new game, really?"

wraith313,business,1389197111.0,"I would argue that your friends fall into this category:

*Like it or not, and I have been a waiter so I know this is true, a lot of waiters love to complain about tips even though the problem isn't that serious. Any waiter worth their salt will be able to make, at any restaurant that has moderate foot traffic, well over minimum wage on average. The ones who don't, I have found through personal experience, are either lazy (don't want to refill drinks, leave customers hanging around waiting for checks, etc) or they just aren't good at their job (not everyone is cut out for that line of work). Tips and gratuity are supposed to be based on service. They are not supposed to be mandatory. Do people abuse this occasionally? yeah. But the vast majority don't. The vast majority will drop 20% on that line regardless of the service they got. A lot of waiters abuse that fact and do less work, expecting they will get the tip regardless. A lot of times they will get it regardless.*

A lot of people I worked with also fell into that category. And I found myself in that category a few times as well. Providing exceptional service isn't difficult, however. How hard is it to make sure my drink doesn't get empty, take my order correctly, take care of any issues I have at the table, and speak to me nicely with a smile? That's exceptional service. If someone can't manage that, they don't deserve 20%.

Edit: You also have to remember: Waiting tables is an entry level job. By all rights, minimum wage is what they *should be paid*. But we all know that after tips, they make much more than that, regardless of what they tell their friends. *AND* they don't declare the cash tips and pay taxes on it half the time if they can get away with it."

About two years ago, I went to a local coffee shop to get a cuppa on my lunch break. About 10 minutes before I had to leave, a middle-aged woman wondered if she could sit at my table. I had to leave within a few minutes - I had to walk back to work, which takes about 10 minutes. I chatted with her for a couple of minutes, so it didn't seem like she offended me in any matter. We just talked about the weather and our preferred drinks at the shop, then I politely excused myself.

Whenever someone strikes up conversation, I generally try to humour them, even for a little bit. Usually it's just small talk. As per the example above, it's usually about something like the weather. 

Even though I'm not one to strike up conversations with strangers (I'm pretty shy), I think it's polite to reciprocate if someone initiates the conversation."

mr_fishy,asexuality,1389197216.0,"That's a really tough position to be in. I've also had issues with people I'm really good friends with then getting SOs and kind of ignoring everyone else. This isn't an issue with you necessarily, but more likely an issue with your friend and her bf. A lot of people fall into the trap of hanging out almost exclusively with their partner to the detriment of their other relationships. It happens.

Honestly, to me it seems like her bf is a little too controlling. If he was getting super jealous and making a fuss over her hanging out with you, it's possible he twisted her arm until she caved and stopped hanging out with you to make him feel more comfortable. That's pretty stupid, especially since you don't seem to be romantically interested in her, just really good friends. If that is what happened, bad on him for being really possessive and bad on her for not standing up to him.

It's also possible that they're just going through a kind of honeymoon phase since they just got to move in together. If he lived farther away before and they didn't get to see each other that often, it's only natural that she would want to hang out with him a lot now that she has the opportunity, but she takes you for granted because you've always been close by. That will start to fade at some point, though. It's really hard to only hang out with your SO for extended periods of time.

My advice is to just wait this out for a little while. If your friend continues to ignore you in favor of her SO, try to talk to her about it. If she really cares for you she'll probably try to hang out with you at least a little more, regardless of what her boyfriend says. Also, it may or may not help to talk to this bf and tell him that you're not trying to steal her away and make her your gf or anything, but this girl is a close friend and it sucks that he's monopolizing all her time. She should be able to socialize with whomever she wants."

InfinitelyThirsting,AskWomen,1389197264.0,"Being shy is not a choice. Shy people can't just decide to go out and be a confident social butterfly; if they could, you wouldn't see so many people asking for advice about it on the internet.

A homebody doesn't have to have a below average sexual past. Also, people here seem to not understand what outgoing means. It just means friendly and socially confident, it doesn't mean you are literally going out all the time. It also has absolutely nothing to do with your sexuality. There are plenty of outgoing virgins.

And wanting someone specifically so you can ""educate"" them in sex is just the definition of being self-centered, and is completely unhealthy. That's treating your partner as a toy and possession, not an equal human being. Egad. Alright, you managed to pick one that is perhaps not hypocritical, but it's even worse.

And if they do prefer a homebody for ""feeling at ease"", or whatever, then the important trait is being a homebody, and sexual partners would be irrelevant; it shouldn't matter, if they found a nice homebody, if that homebody had had a promiscuous streak in the past. Remember, this whole thread is about rejecting someone specifically because of their promiscuous behaviour, not about liking traits that probably don't lead to promiscuous behaviour. Someone for whom promiscuity is great for themselves, but is a dealbreaker standard for their partners."

I would have been totally happy to leave them be, but they've declared war on me twice so far, so I thought I ought to stick a wedge into their territory to keep them honest. It's weird that they keep declaring war... They can't break through my combined Zhou-Korea fleet, so I just blockade them into submission. It's definitely an issue of bad AI.

KissMyAxeAndStaff,dating_advice,1389197362.0,"I guess we'll just go down the list of questions, haha. Also, thanks for posting!

1. There is no real set way of it leading up to sex. I will say I generally meet them in a group setting, but alcohol isn't always a factor. Around a 50/50 split I'd say.  I think I said this in a previous reply, but its not always someone brand new that I hook up with. I could know them for a few years or a few days. I haven't been on an actual date in forever ago. No real planned sex at first, but after awhile ya its kind of assumed on both of our accounts. I wouldn't say I ever had a serious discussion about STDs/Pregnancy other then I personally want neither. Haha. Just fyi I do get tested once a month, and wrap it up.

2. I don't directly say it, but I do keep it monogamous. I don't think I have the ability to keep something like that under control. One at a time keeps life simple. I'll still talk to other females, but friends are friends. I won't just up and drop them because I'm sleeping with someone.

3. I wouldn't say secretive. I'll answer any questions someone has, but I don't bring up my life spontaneously.  I'm actually fairly reserved with bringing up what I've experienced, in my past, on my own free will. I generally meet these people through friends, as I'm also not one to just randomly talk to strangers. Outside of my job, my friends are my life. If someone is coming into my life they will meet them as that's generally where I'm at, if not at home by myself.

4. I'm just not naturally open in the whole vulnerable sort of way. Be it from being an only child or from being in the Infantry. I dealt with my own problems my whole life by myself. To do that with someone I've only been together with romantically for a month or two tops doesn't really provide that safety net of developed trust. I'm the guy you go to with problems, not the kind that spills his. I honestly have no idea about the whole *we* thing. I don't really pay attention to how I talk. I know I swear a lot, haha. I guess I'll have to keep an open ear to myself, and figure that out.

The pressure comes because even with those who say they prefer pixie cuts, it's still very dependent on face structure as well as hair type.  When we see people saying ""I love pixie cuts...but not on these people, they look bad with it"" then the thought process is going to often be ""well, crap, am I in the group that looks good or bad with a pixie cut?!""

The thing is, pixie cuts *are* pretty hard to pull off.  There is most certainly pressure to have a flattering hair style.  If you think you're in the group that can pull it off and cut your hair to find you aren't, then you can 1) get a wig or 2) wait it out for a very long time to grow back while people make commentary on how you can't pull off the pixie cut."

yourdungeonmaster,loremasters,1389197533.0,"Make it surprisingly easy at first: very few gnolls are present.  In fact, the only ones present are the old and infirm, the juveniles, and the females (of course, when you're not a gnoll, you might not be able to tell the difference).  They know how to defend their space as well as they can: they know the choke points, can set up barriers, loop behind the party and lock them in rooms, etc., but if it comes to combat, their skills are weak and their weapons simple.

Then, when the party is deep down in it, glorying in their obvious superiority, and the only way out is back the way they came, that's when the gnoll hunting party returns from a raid. All their warriors, fully armed, and with the high ground on their home turf."

naimnotname,SquaredCircle,1389197708.0,"&gt; There's nothing wrong with either and hard and fast lines in the sand are not a good thing.

Except they aren't. Cornette said it best in this shoot. When the 2 boom periods hit, every form of wrestling blended in to make this current perception that it is now (a joke), the realism stopped and it became sports entertainment. 

Sports entertainment is what Vince McMahon spent 30 years homogenizing pro wrestling into what it is now. The proof of this is guys not trying to become what they wanted to be as kids, those guys live on the indy circuit (your Steens, your Roddy Strongs, your Briscoes), now guys are trying to become sports entertainers with a specific skill set the the WWE wants. 

Pro wrestling is not pro wrestling anymore and that's okay. But we gotta stop pretending it's the same thing.

"
obsidianechoes,3Dprinting,1389197710.0,"Yes.  I used Slic3r for a year first but bought the Creator software last May and found that it consistently gives me much better prints.  The default profile for the M2 is really good but I've still found my own favourite values for temperature and cooling.  The slicing engine is also about 20 times faster than Slic3r.  The only quirk with the Creator software is with thin walls.  If any modeled feature is less than the extrusion width, it won't be sliced and included in the gcode.  So when I model parts, I have to be careful to not accidentally have any corners or faces thinner than ~0.4mm.  Not a big deal and I always preview the print in Creator before sending it to the printer.  I feel Creator also does a better job with support generation that I can actually snap off to remove after the print.  I'm currently looking into meshmixer for support generation to see if I can waste less material on supports but otherwise, Creator works as intended.

I also bought the LCD interface a few months ago and it's a nice add-on.  Not sure it's worth the $100 but the ability to start/pause/stop print jobs and monitor progress without a computer is nice.  Note about the LCD:  Since my M2 is older, it uses the RAMBo 1.0d board with 1/8 microstepping and the LCD firmware Makergear provides is only for the newer board.  I had to manually make some changes to the code and compile my own firmware version to get it to work with my machine.  Can't imagine this is relevant to you except to say that if you go the route of an LCD screen, I may be able to help answer any questions you have."

Another point, any data being backed up ""to the cloud"" should be encrypted before it goes off premise. If you're not doing that then you're doing it _wrong_ and depending on your industry you're probably in violation of federal law and business contracts.

It's a strong pull, which is understandable. But it doesn't make much sense. And like I said, I've worked in the industry too. All parts. I made the most in tips as a bartender and also did the least work. I did the most work in the kitchen and got the least money because I saw no tip share. People in front of house often got tips based on work I did and even had receipts with notes on it to prove it. They often got tips meant for me and kept them.

Finally, as a waiter, it was middle of the road. Rich people never tipped because they never felt obligated. Poor people were the most picky and never wanted to tip. I didn't mind, I was just doing my job. I HATED tip share with other wait staff though, simply because they would half ass their work and then I would bust my ass and they would get a portion of my tips. Tip-share is what kills the industry, IMO. And cultural obligations to tip. I say do away with both and you will get a bunch of really good waiters and waitresses who like their jobs and get paid a far wage."

The problem with Pay-to-win, that It seems like you failed to mention is when the free content that is released revolves around the people who payed… ALOT. They miss represent the population and that is what is the major issue. 

Finding a game like this is like asking someone to do a services for you but you don't feel any need to pay them.

Of course, I still think they should be allowed to respond to women's answers. Like if they wanted to compare a response they see to their own observations, or ask for more details, or even just to say ""TIL"".

You could probably get a good idea if you went and tried on a pixie cut wig, but that's taking out the hair type element which is also important.  I'd say the safest ""test"" route would be a few pixie wigs and then discussions with hair stylists (maybe a few) about how the person's hair type would work with that cut.  I know for my hair type which is best described as thick enough for four people, anything shorter than shoulder length and the thickness makes it into a poof ball.  Super short just looks like a mini afro.  Can't change the thickness of my hair, so I stay far away from any hairstyle that will make it POOF.  When I did the hair posing with existing hair the poof didn't appear though because the length I still had weighed down that effect.  

I can't tell you what the odds are for being able to pull of that cut, but I think generally it's strong facial features and either thin to medium thick hair.  Whatever percent of the population has that combo going for them."

I think I didn't make my point clearly. I was trying to say that while number of partners can be indicative of issues or not desirable traits, this isn't always the case, especially as people get older and have more years of being sexually active under their belts.

My other point is that, anecdotally, every short guy (under 5'5"") that I've ever dated had loads of baggage. I dumped them not because they were short, but because of what they let it become. I avoided short guys after that not because I have a problem with them being short, but because I didn't want to deal with the insecurity and the baggage that most of them have. 

This is why I see not wanting to date short guys and not wanting to date girls with lots of partners as pretty equivalent.  At least for me, it's not about the height or the partners, it's about what it often can mean in terms of how it affects who they are. That being said, I still think it's a shame to have these preconceived notions because it can lead to missing out on people that don't have the baggage that typically accompanies a certain height or certain past.

obsidianechoes,3Dprinting,1389198225.0,"That's a good point!  I also experienced some chomping of filament at the stepper gear due to too much resistance.  I ended up printing a little adapter piece for both ends of the PTFE tube that holds the tube concentric with the hole of the filament arm over the spool and over the inlet of the filament drive.  It seemed to help.  The other reason the stepper gear would chop into the filament was because my starting layer height was too close to the bed increasing back pressure at the nozzle.

goodguy101,AskReddit,1389198261.0,"Got in l lot of trouble earlier in life. High school dropout, worked as a cook, and later an electrician. Went to jail a few times for hanging out with stupid bad people. Probably fortunate that I did because if I never got in trouble, I would have become a very bad person.

I went to jail a few times then prison for a little bit. The people here are right on the money. The worst thing about prison is the excruciating boredom. You see the same walls and the same superstitious idiots every day for as long as you are there.

I moved around a bunch and finally got my shit together when I went to rehab. Drugs were not THE problem, they were a symptom that produced the most obvious consequences. I could probably run an entire thread about that shit.

I went to community college for a bit and after some shit talking from my landlord (55 year old bachelor doctor: fun stories from that situation), I changed my major to electrical engineering. I transferred to a university (California is awesome) and got a degree in EE.

While at the UC, I got a job in an optics lab. I worked there for 5 years during undergraduate and graduate programs. I learned that although I have come a loooong way from the person I was, I am still a very different creature than my colleagues who were working on their PhD at 23-28 years old.

I stayed clean and sober for a total of 8 years. It was the most formative time in my life and value what I have learned from it very much. I now drink occasionally. Where I live has a HUGE craft beer scene. I also got my medical marijuana prescription. I rarely smoke, camping, etc. but with my experience with the law made me want to have my shit covered if I happen to have an unlucky surprise from a zealous cop."

ZapActions-dower,gallifrey,1389198269.0,"There's a reason the Doctor hasn't appeared on Torchwood before.  It's an adult show very much not meant for Children.  Young Doctor Who fans will want to see any appearance the Doctor makes on another show, so they'd want to see the episode of Torchwood with the Doctor.  Torchwood had, in one episode, a girl possessed by an alien that fed off orgasmic energy having sex with a guy in a club bathroom while the security guard watched on the security monitor, jacking off.  Of course, not all episodes are like that, and the ones with the Doctor could be fairly clean, but now the kids see these characters they know very little about and want to know more.  That's not something the BBC would do.

Personally, I really liked Torchwood (though I haven't seen season 4) and I rather enjoy McGann, so *I* would like it.  But the Doctor himself would not ever appear on Torchwood, even if it were still on the air."

uncomfortably,whowouldwin,1389198423.0,"D and V stomp everything that moves and here's why. 

In their only recorded fight (in the halls of the ministry of magic), we see evidence of them using magic far beyond the comprehension of anyone else in the series. Also in the series we see that two wizards can complete spells that one can't even dream of. So in theory we have the two most powerful wizards of the past 150 years, and the two most learned wizards of the age, fighting 100-150 average to higher than average wizards, most of whom would be students who have no real deadly skill. You would have, in total, about 8-10 wizards who are grown, none of whom are in the same league as D or V. In a weakened state, V has fought three of the greatest wizards of the age (book 7, fight at hogwarts) seemingly with ease. A Voldemort that isn't weakened by the missing fragments of soul could smoke show, and a bloodlusted D has more power and skill than that. I think the battle would come down to how quickly they could remove the students from the fight. 

With planning it's easily D and V again. V raised an army of the undead to protect a horcrux, recruited giants, dementors, and all nature of foul beasts. D is one of the most respected wizards in the universe. He could easily raise an army to match on the rest. They could create defenses that no one from the other side could penetrate, they could erase the other teams leadership from the shadows, they could mind control half their army from across the country. It would be a shit show, an utter stomp. "

I would just cut contact. I know it will be hard. I know you feel like you have 2 years invested in her and you can't get that time back.

If it isn't working it isn't working. Find ways to keep occupied, improve yourself, and start casually dating when you think you are ready. Unfortunately you will probly miss her for the better part of between 2-4 months. That's been my experience. But the quicker you start working on yourself, meeting new people, and being social, the quicker it will go away.

Also in my experience: It is not a good idea to get back with her. You broke it off for a reason. You broke it off because you saw her bringing you into a downward spiral and you saw the relationship becoming toxic. Good on you. A lot of people *never* realize that is happening. Don't second guess yourself. Don't fall for it when she says ""she can change"" and don't fall for her attempts to manipulate or turn your friends against you.

Don't play her game. Don't badmouth her to your friends, don't say anything at all about her. Just cut her out. If she's around and starts making you uncomfortable, excuse yourself. If they take her side over yours, that's life. Just move on the best you can.

Edit: I wouldn't bother with the talk either. That is just going to get you into trouble, IMO. Also: if you are texting her or calling her often I would cut that out immediately.

Good luck!

Skirtz,Bass,1389198727.0,"-To be honest, I chose bass over guitar because I thought it'd be something nice and easy to pick up. That was 5 years ago and I've learned that's not necessarily the case since then.

-I wouldn't say they'd ""mess up"" your fingertips. Sometimes you might play long enough that you'll get blisters on your fingers or your fingers will bleed, but that'll just cause your fingertips to callus and toughen up. You'll get the same thing playing guitar.

-I have two 4 string basses, a 5 string, and a 6 string. It really depends what you want to play. A standard six string doesn't have the same tuning as a guitar, keep in mind (it's tuned as B-E-A-D-G-C). My Six string Schecter I use more to play very melodic, complex pieces. My 5 string Ibanez I use to play nice, heavy, slap and pop jazz/funk music, and my 4 string Riverhead and Fender are more for just simple basic rock, but you can set up any bass any way you want to play whatever you want. That's just what I have my personal basses set up to play.

-I wouldn't say it's easier. At first it might be but if you pursue it you'll find there's a lot of intricate techniques that are bass-specific that are pretty hard to master (like slapping and popping or double-thumbing). Chords don't equal difficulty. I've played Primus pieces on a 4-string bass that use chords, but those weren't even close to being the most difficult part of those songs. I'd argue to say that the average bassist is more talented than the average guitarist.

-Never played in a band, wouldn't know

-Yes. I also play piano and cello and, in the past, have played drums and trumpet.

-Geddy Lee of Rush immediately comes to mind. He also plays keyboard. I've seen videos of him playing keyboard, bass, and singing all at once.

-Some will, but not all. As I've said, some techniques are bass-specific just like some techniques are guitar-specific."

&gt;My only idea is kind of what happened with me and my ex. We were together for almost two years, but the last 6 months were awful. Lots of fighting and I never wanted sex with him. I started to hate him and treat him like crap so I finally ended it. Later we started talking again as friends and soon enough, we were having sex. It was hotter and more enjoyable. I'm not sure why, but there was no pressure. I could do what I wanted and didn't have to stick around to cuddle or talk. I could fuck and leave. **I also knew he was trying to get with another girl and that itself was hot. I know it's fucked up but it was a turn on for me.**

Pre-selection and jealousy. They are the bellows to a woman's sexual fire."

It's fascinating that you think having a position that was mainstream for both parties 5 years ago and was held by the current ultra-liberal president until 2 years ago makes someone a ""religious fanatic"". 

On top of that the last Republican nominees were McCain and Romney, who represent the left wing of the Republican Party and had to work hard to convince evangelicals they weren't anti-religious nutjobs.

You don't call people out on their bullshit.  You are the one who is full of shit.  People like you make it impossible to heal the damage racism has done, because you're such pantywaist little cowardly bitches that you can't stand the thought that you might actually have to think about someone who isn't you for a change.

&gt;That's your problem. It's all black and white in your eyes (literally and figuratively). Just because I believe people like you accuse others of racism to give yourself a sense of smug accomplishment doesn't make me a racist, and the fact that you believe so pretty much delegitimizes everything you say (not saying you were making much sense in the first place). 

You believe EVERYONE who points out racism is just doing ti to score brownie points, you racist fucking tool.  That's how fucking loser dipshit whiney little bitches like you derail conversations.

You go ""Bawwww I'm such a little faggot I'm going to cry and whine and rail against anyone who is even mentions racism exists!""

You're fucking pathetic!

&gt;You're just as bigoted as the people you're talking shit about, you just prejudge people based on their ideas. 

Yes, you're right!  I do judge people on their ideas!  Your ideas are stupid and I am judging you based on them!  Judging people on **ideas** is fine, because the ideas you endorse reflect the content of your character.  And your character is that of a whiny, entitled bitchfaced weaselshit.

&gt;Do you seriously not know how fucking idiotic that makes you sound? Now I'm racist because I have a black friend?

Only racists think they can prove they aren't racist by citing that they have a black friend.

&gt;Direct quote from him- ""quit trying to make people hate each other. **You're looking at problems that are there**, but making them much bigger than they actually are."" 

OH BITCH!!!  HAH HAH HAH!!! Your black friend agrees with me, that there is actually something racist about this.  Looking pretty fucking stupid now, since you just made up a black friend and had him agree with me.

&gt;Newsflash, dipshit: being racially tolerant does not make you special nowadays. 

I know!  It's *expected*.  Being racially tolerant is about as special as being able to tie your shoes or not shit your pants. Nobody is impressed when you're racially tolerant.

The question is what someone wants out of a car. If you're purely looking at what the car can do on paper, sure. But that's not it. It's also an experiental product. You show what you can experience with that car, so that people consider it when looking for an off-road truck. Again, you signal the capabilities towards your consumers.

Very few people choose a car based just on how they feel about it. They consider mileage, the luxuries it offers, everything to do with the car. The ad just makes people either aware of the brand, or what you can do with it. Both serve a function in the decision making process of consumers. 

On the claim of how many people like your product: you're misrepresenting the claim of how many people consider your product good. When you make a claim like that, you've got to back it up with evidence. 9 people saying it's good and 1 person disliking it isn't evidence, it's a very limited sample.

We (i.e. those of us who've followed it closely) know that these things take time and we're in the process of obtaining CPO's (compulsory purchase orders), which were applied for in summer 2012 I believe. I don't think there's much chance of us not getting them but any objections have to be given time to be heard and if necessary adjudicated against.

The NFL rumour is interesting but I have huge doubts about that, it's been doing the round for a few months. If it's an actual NFL franchise (not NFL europe) then it'd have to be something that is I assume the NFL agrees to. Clearly there are logistical issues with having a team so far away. Games would have to be played maybe 8pm to 11pm and the transport system doesn't really cater to late night events especially if it's unpredictable.

ITT (invitation to tender) is interesting. When we see it, it'll be a milestone in the project and if the expansion rumour is correct we'd probably get an announcement beforehand but I imagine that the NFL wouldn't award us a franchise for a while. Another thing that suggests the rumour is false is we'd have to apply for planning permission for a new design which may not be approved and would certainly take us right up to the end of the year."

Samipearl19,changemyview,1389199433.0,"While I agree with your premise, your reasoning for it isn't the best. 

I don't think the victim being punished equally to the offender is the main concern. The main issue with these policies is they don't work as a deterrent and they do more harm than good insofar as keeping students safe and damaging teacher/administrator relationships with students and parents. 

Let's go through a few examples. Here's a case to back up your victim-punishment claim, but in something much more severe than two kids getting into a fight. A girl in Texas got expelled for *being raped* by a classmate. http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/23/21795266-kicked-out-of-high-school-for-public-lewdness-after-reporting-rape?lite

Clearly, this doesn't work. Obviously, nothing in the zero-tolerance policy deterred this attacker from raping this girl, but now any future victims are much less likely to come forward. This is a much more powerful argument than ""it gives them the message that it's wrong to protect yourself."" Under this kind of policy, it's wrong to even report crimes...the worst kinds of violent crimes. 

Second, there are those who try to abide by the policy and get punished anyway. There are several of these stories, but here is one of a NC teen who was suspended and charged with a felony for calling his mom to come get the gun he accidentally left in his truck. http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/05/02/2866149/johnston-county-high-school-student.html

The fact is zero tolerance has gone far too extremely in punishing children for playing. How many of you played war or armies when you were in elementary school? Now you can't. Here's an 8 year old suspended for an imaginary finger gun: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/01/jordan-bennett-suspended-_n_4022494.html

Finally, here is a report from the APA on how these policies are not shown to deter ""crime"" at all but are shown to damage relationships between the school and students and their families: http://www.apa.org/pubs/info/reports/zero-tolerance.pdf

As a student who went to school under such policies, I hated the administration for it. I felt incredibly alienated, and I never felt one bit safer. If someone truly wants to hurt people, zero tolerance isn't going to keep them from doing it. "

The weird relationship between Fahrenheit and Celsius (and the fact that Fahrenheit and Celsius are the same temperature at -40) is a result of the fact that an increase or decrease of 1 degree Celsius represents more of an actual change of temperature than a change of 1 degree Fahrenheit does, and that Celsius and Fahrenheit ""start"" at two different places.

0 C (32 F) is the freezing point of water, while 0 F(-17.77 C) is the freezing point of brine. 100 F (37.77 C) was the best estimate of the average temperature of the human body there was when the Fahrenheit scale was made. We now define average human body temperature as 98.6 F, which is just a conversion from 37 C.

Out of the night that covers me

Black as the pit from pole to pole

I thank whatever gods may be

For my unconquerable soul.


In the fell clutch of circumstance

I have not winced nor cried aloud

Under the bludgeonings of chance

My head is bloody but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears

Looms but the Horror of the shade

And yet the menace of the years

Finds and shall find me, unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate

How charged with punishments the scroll.

I am the captain of my soul."

a 2-second search on craigslist (local) found 2 prospects. If you broaden your search for other years, makes, models, and areas, you're bound to find something in good condition for a fair price.

Also either I can't find all DLC, but by what I can find WarGame: AB doesn't even reach 800 units and as I have understood it most of core units are from EE. 

Also from where you got all that RD information? After seeing teaser I did quick google job and couldn't find any of that. I'm not saying *""You are liar!""*, just that I personally can't find any of that. I need dive into forums for that intel?

Also I admit I really don't like that they take content from previous game, make little bit new, slap it together with some engine updates and call it brand new WarGame. To me it starts to look like CoD of RTS scene in someways. Maybe I'm just cynical asshole.

P.S. Price was checked from Steam, don't expect RD being less

P.P.S. I own WarGame: EE, but ended up dropping it as balance was utter dog shit and after it was fixed everyone expected you to have everything unlocked for ""min max"" decks."

I'm not sure I totally agree with this.  Obviously nothing is ever black and white, but surely doing the right thing, regardless of the reason, is still doing the right thing.

Let me stop you there...have you seen the decline in multiplayer activity since the game's release? Only the remain ten thousand people are fine with it and only because they're still playing. I've played Halo since 2004 (competitively from '05-'06) and I call it the worst of the 5 Halo games.

There's always room for innovation that adds to the experience. Halo 2 did that with the more vehicles, energy sword, dual-wielding, and the cool in-game hacks like double shooting and super bouncing. Halo 3 kept what Halo 2 did well and added equipment and appearance permutations.

What did Halo 4 innovate well? Nothing. In comparison to H2/H3, the maps suck, the gameplay sucks, the weapons suck. Look back to Halo 2, EVERY SINGLE MAP was a classic. It's not nostalgia to me, the maps of H2 and H3 are classic.

I can do a damn essay on the faults of Halo 4 but a lot of it will be regurgitation of what has been said over the last year by so many others."

Yes, that's what I said in my original post.

&gt;so if inflation is going down - and no, i'm not arguing with you as to the source of inflation, then why would the CPI go up if not for the fact that corporations will increase prices simply on the fact that ""they can""?

Because prices can still rise if the inflation rate is going down.  Let's say you're moving from 6% inflation to 3% inflation.  3% inflation means that prices are still rising, even though the inflation rate is falling."

As long as there is a healthy population of pond snails, they'll go for the easier, smaller snacks every time. If you find they've wiped out the pond snail population and dont want to reintroduce them, you can just supplement with meaty foods (they like bloodworms and aquadine hi-protein duraflakes, IME). It takes them a few months to get rid of an infestation, IME. 

They sell well and for a decent price, so most LFS are more than willing to take them off your hands once you've gotten the pest snail issue wiped out anyways (though IME, those jerks are never truly gone). My LFS can't stock them fast enough, they're so in demand. "

The overachieving capitalist(using this term as an analogy for a person that has classical western values and behaviors) will reach a point of diminishing returns, so he will requite with more effort, the cycle repeats until he either decides he has enough and starts consciously enjoying himself, or tries to compensate by engaging in more unhealthy and unsustainable behavior(if you would allow me to use the pop-sci term of middle age crisis).

Eolond,AskReddit,1389200654.0,"I have long hair (http://i.imgur.com/IfbQ41j.jpg).

Since hair takes a decently long time to grow, you won't really notice any radical changes once it starts to really get long.  Sometimes it gets in the way, but not as often as you'd think.

I love it in the winter, as it acts like a built-in scarf + ear muffs.  It's also long enough to keep my back warm, so I guess it's like having a cape, too.

When it comes to caring for it, well....it doesn't take any extra effort on my part, honestly.  I had short (about an inch long) hair for awhile, and god that was such a pain in the ass.  I had to start using gels and sprays just to style it.  With long hair, all I have to do is wash/condition it, and brush it.  Granted, I use more shampoo and conditioner than I did with short hair, but it's still less of a pain in the ass over-all.

Also, long hair is nice because I can easily get it out of my face any time I want just by using a simple hair elastic.  It's also nice because I have more styling options over-all.

The only issue with long hair is keeping the ends healthy.  I have issues with static, too.  The easiest way to maintain it is to not use styling products or blow dryers, and to get regular trims.

Of course, my hair is naturally straight, so my experiences are probably pretty tame compared to people that have coarse/frizzy/curly hair.

Dying long hair is annoying.  You have to use more product to get it covered, but you also have to deal with growing the color out, which can take months if not years, depending on how long your hair is.  With short hair, I could dye it however and then a trim would be enough to get rid of the dyed bits."

here's the thing: you have a very serious crush.  you are definitely in love, but you're not in love with a person.  you are in love with an idea.  when you develop a serious crush you take one person's identity and apply all of your romantic fantasies to it.  you imagine the miraculous possibilities that COULD come with that person's real life affection, and forget that none of these thing are actually real yet, and many of them never will be.  a single individual whom you barely know becomes the vessel for all of your hopes and dreams, and the prospect of losing that person becomes as terrifying as killing those hopes and dreams themselves.  when we operate in fantasy mode, as with a crush, we are busy chasing some impossible ideal future... a future where we believe there is some perfect set of circumstances that makes us permanently happy.

experience will teach you that fantasy and reality are very different.  there is no magical guy, nor is there a magical set of circumstances that will show up one day and make everything finally wonderful.  life finds ways to be painful and annoying no matter great our circumstances seem (imagine how awesome your imperfect life seems to a starving child in ethiopia).

if you're dying to diagnose yourself, it sounds like you have an [anxious attachment style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_in_adults#Anxious.E2.80.93preoccupied_attachment) (which is sometimes referred to as anxious attachment disorder).  it's not really a kind of mental illness, but more a learned method of relating to people that requires a tremendous amount of validation and reassurance from external parties for you to grasp your own worth.  fantasies about your potentially perfect future, then, don't make sense without a romantic partner there making you feel good about yourself.  your idea of a worthwhile tomorrow, then, is completely dependent on finding someone who loves you.

for me, anxious attachment isn't so much something to set out to change as it is something to be constantly aware of.  you can't just flip a switch and cancel all your learned experiences about how people relate to one another (attachment style is most strongly impacted by the way your parents treated you as a child).  instead, you can learn to appreciate that your constant need for reassurance and validation isn't highly normal, and you can work with this accordingly to develop a stronger sense of self independent of others' approval.

developing a strong sense of self; one where you genuinely believe yourself to be the source of your own future happiness, is critical to living a fulfilling life.  wanting a relationship to be a part of your future is reasonable, but allowing a delusional crush to cloud your judgment could land you in relationships that do nothing to foster a healthier sense of identity.  personally, i found that a relationship with another anxiously attached person was very important.  being with someone who requires the same amount of reassurance as i do has deeply improved the health of my relationships as compared to trying to overhaul my personality to some general model of ""healthy-medium-average-normal,"" for the sake of someone else's relationship needs.  do your best to find someone who thrives on what you have to offer and vice versa and you’ll learn to love an entire person, not just the way that person makes you feel."

Cartossin,apple,1389200830.0,"I think you're missing some points w/r to laptop design.  

* Apple laptops are not designed to use the case as a heat sink. If you look at the heat sink design, you'll see they intentionally avoid a lot of surface area of heat sink directly touching the unibody. The good thermal conductiivty is actually a disadvantage for laptops because it makes the bottom ""feel"" hotter than materials like magnesium, carbon fiber, or plastic.

* The strength of magnesium. It should be noted that magnesium laptops are so much lighter than aluminum ones that they don't NEED to be as strong.  Imagine your TV remote control. It's indestructible right? Why? Because it's so light that impact from dropping it is going to have very low energy.

I have a Macbook Air (latest) 13 inch and I love it; but if it was made of magnesium or carbon fiber, it would be nicer. I believe the magnesium Toshiba Porteges and Sony Vaio Z/pro to be tougher and lighter than my macbook air and their low thermal conductivity means they don't heat up my legs as much.  The MBA 13 is so much better in every other way, I still believe it to be the best choice for me.

edit: I think Apple uses aluminum mainly due to premium look/feel and ease/cost of manufacturing compared to magnesium and carbon fiber."

As for ""better uses of their time"", that's your opinion and your probably coming from the false assumption that it's MLP 24/7 for bronies. I'm sure that their are some fans like that, but that's true for almost any hobby or interest, and they are a minority. If watching this show and taking in fan created content based on it makes them happy, I'd say that's the best use of their time. You're also assuming they're ""lonely and uncultured"", and maybe I'm not a good read for this because I'm not taking a census and I'm going off the few bronies I know, have met, and myself, but most of them are in relationships or at least have a good network of friends. As for uncultured, this is again a baseless assumption you're making. I certainly don't think that MLP is anywhere close to the peak of art or culture, but it's certainly not bad, and I'm sure it's not the only thing that bronies are into.

I'm not sure what you're hoping to get out of coming here and being patronizing, but you certainly don't seem interested in knowing why we like the show.

RochelleH,worldnews,1389201117.0,"The EWC as a general rule is fantastic; exactly what a union should be. France and Italy would be the exceptions. These unions have not adapted with globalisation and generally do not seek to improve the business' performance, or to propose anything that will. They are old-school, protectionist, deadweight unions that do not look anywhere beyond short term monetary gain. There is no concern for business profitability, sustainable employment, or local industry growth. They are simply all about taking, and the employment legislation in both countries supports it, not to mention the power that local, council-level politicians have in a multinational's decisionmaking process. Unfortunately, this has lead to the said exodus of multinationals. The best example of EWC working as they should would be Germany and the Scandinavian countries. It is a very naive position to take, this immediate ""evil corporate greed"" stance. I suggest you read up a bit on the conditions a low-to-no-skill manufacturing employee in France has.

""After seeing the profits"". Do you have any idea of labour costs in France and Italy? They are astronomical, well above the average 65% of operating costs that a business would expect to be paying, long past competitive, and productivity is poor because of the ridiculously meagre work schedule (I've seen  full-time positions whittled down to five hours per day). Do not assume that to be productive, a business will simply seek to pay shitty wages. There are many more factors that enter into the decision. If that were the case, Europe would have been completely without manufacturing plants years back, as would Brazil, where I am currently based. Of course, the blame for such situations should not be placed squarely on the shoulders of unions, but governments that should be instrumental in increasing productivity and creating an attractive environment for foreign direct investment, rather than simply passing laws that cement their political position in the short term."

Lost_Afropick,AskReddit,1389201137.0,"Good post.  Upvoted.  

I still disagree strongly that it's a war though.  Syria is in a war.  Iraq was a war, albeit very brief.  But flying to drones to fight a war against something as nebulous as ""terror"" just isn't.  Terror is an abstract idea, deliberately vague.  You could keep fighting a *war* on terror as long as we've been fighting a *war* on drugs.  And just as many have died in both.  But that doesn't really make them wars.

When nations go to war with each other, or against themselves like Syria it's a whole different story with morality and hesitance about codes of honour quickly changing.  As WW2 went on the allies started carpet bombing civilian populations like the Japanese cities and the German ones indiscriminately.  Because when you ARE in war, real war as it drags on so does the desparation which has to be a factor.

A peacetime occupation to hunt down and kill undesirables (which btw I fully go along with) isn't a war.  Especially when as I said the drones are operating in supposedly friendly countries airspace.  That's why drones in this context have to have a discussion about the way they're used.  It isn't a war.

progbuck,OkCupid,1389201139.0,"In my experience, /r/seduction has a split personality. The PUA side is a sort of Red Pill-Lite, where they mostly ditch the over misogyny and hate, but are still mostly approaching women like a different species.

There is, however, a pretty strong segment of /r/seduction that I believe largely approaches sex and relationships from a sex-positive, feminist perspective. Essentially, the ""treat women like a guy friend you want to sleep with"" crowd. 

They are pretty broadly different in their world-view, so I think that they mostly talk over each other rather than to each other. I do think the second perspective is winning the narrative, though. Especially since The Red Pill is peeling away the sexually-frustrated crazies."

slockley,AskReddit,1389201159.0,"&gt; What moral code do you follow

My moral code is that which reflects the moral teaching of the Bible.  That includes hurting others, but also includes honoring God.  Note that I don't expect anyone else to necessarily share my moral code.

The (admittedly minor) problem with a moral code based solely on a victim being hurt is that it disallows victimless crime.  Suicide, music piracy, corporate shoplifting, ""little white lies"" and drug use are examples of morally wrong actions that can be justified using a strict victim-dependent moral code.

&gt; two men making love a hundred miles away bothers you?

This illustrates my frustration with the argument.  I have only implied that I have a moral opposition to the homosexual act.  Yet you've concluded that it bothers me, which I deny is relevant.  For example, viewing pornography is something I am morally opposed to, but am not bothered by (and indeed it has some allure).  On the other hand, eating olives bother me greatly, but I have no moral stance against it.  I don't base my moral code on my propensities for misbehavior, but I rarely have a conversation about the morality of gay sex without accusations of bigotry."

unicornbomb,Aquariums,1389201171.0,"What are the dimensions of the 5 gal? 10g isnt too much bigger than rectangular 5 gals, and they're 10 bucks at petco right now. 

A single assassin snail (they arent actually snails -- they're whelks, closely related to the conch, and one of the only freshwater whelks in the world) would add a pretty negligible bioload -- and depending on the size of the infestation, it might actually lower it.. when my pond snail invasion was at its height, it was obscene how much waste those little assholes created. My substrate was COVERED in snail crap every morning until I got my assassins, now there is hardly anything.

He should leave your other snails and ghost shrimp alone as long as he has a healthy population of pest snails to munch on - they wont go for bigger snails or shrimp unless they're super hungry, or the shrimp/snail is weakened/sick or dead. Once he's got it under control, you can supplement his diet with meaty foods (mine like frozen bloodworms) to keep him happy and prevent other tankmates from looking like dinner. Most LFS will also happily take them off your hands once you no longer need their snail eating power -- mine can hardly keep them in stock, they're so popular and ridiculously effective at what they do. 

If your LFS doesnt have them, this redditor sells them for a fair price and ships with a heat pack: http://www.reddit.com/r/AquaSwap/comments/1ts5ro/fs_assassin_snails_central_fl_250/ -- I just ordered a few more for one of my betta tanks! They're really hardy and handle shipping perfectly fine.



Other options that can cut down the population (but not get rid of them completely) is manual removal. Toss a blanched slice of zucchini or cucumber in the tank overnight -- in the morning it will be crawling with snails and you can toss it. 

I've also used this: http://www.amazon.com/TOM-Aquarium-Maintenance-Cleaner-Operated/dp/B003OYOPNW/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t with the gravel vac attachment removed to suck them off off the substrate when I catch them trying to move in on my fish's dinner, since my corys tend to be slow eaters. I detest snails so I found this horribly satisfying. As a bonus, its an awesome tool for keeping the substrate clean between water changes and sucking up uneaten food and waste before it fouls the water. Makes a big difference in an overstocked tank if you spend a couple minutes a day with it. "

I had to give this some thought. When I first joined, the ""brother"" title  - and especially hearing it so often - really did put me off. It was too... cultish or something. 

But it's only since reading this that I realize that it's been a while since I've felt that way. I can't tell you when it stopped bothering me, but I can tell you that it took me several years of being a Mason - I was probably a JW - that I stopped thinking that this was ""your"" or ""their"" lodge, and starting thinking of it as ""my"" lodge. Do you know what I mean? Not that I wasn't welcomed, but more that I didn't feel a sense of ownership (or something). It was  probably the same with with learning to be cool with the ""brother"" appellation; I just might have needed some time to settle in and really enjoy what was going on. 

There's that bit that we are told early on, about subduing our passions. Passions aren't just wild, exciting emotional states; they apply to everything that we think and feel.

*Alpha release

===============
**v0.2.0 stable/unstable**
===============
*Renamed 'Install DEB' to 'Install Application(DEB)'  
*Added support for 'Install Application(DEB)'  
*Added support for specifying a port  
*Made the UI smaller sorta  
*Small changes here and there  
  

iDevice Manager lets one upload custom Zeppelins and Run Remote Commands. This is the initial release so there is really no features yet.
Upload custom Zeppelins works and so does Remote Commands. I am open to any suggestions. I guess you could consider this ""alpha testing"".

This includes framework, the engine block, the outer case of the alternator, etc. In practice, I've always done it this way: 

1) Makes sure one end of the cables cannot be shorted. I clasp the positive to the insulated handle of the negative to ensure they cannot touch no matter what. Be sure they're not sitting in a puddle of water.

2) Connect cables to dead battery. There should be a much lower voltage/current than the good battery, thus you have a lower chance of hurting yourself.

3) Start vehicle with good battery. 

4) Connect the negative lead to the good battery, then connect the positive.

5) Rev the engine to ~3 or 4k RPM to spin the alternator faster and send more current to the dead battery. After a couple of minutes, try to start the dead vehicle."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389201454.0,"I reduce stress in my life by dealing with it on my own sometimes.  I can't always go to my girlfriend for help because there's either nothing she can do or talking about it will make it worse.

For example, due to your ages, let's say it's an exam (I'll use first person for simplification).  So I have this big exam, and my girlfriend can't help me study.  She can't make me more confident or know the material better.  There's literally nothing she can do to make things better.  Also, I'd rather study when I can and then take my mind off it otherwise.  Therefore, any talking about it or ""trying to make me feel better"" will only make me think about the exam more, and thus, stress me out even more.

And sometimes, I'm stressed about something silly, and I'd rather just get through it because it's stupid to talk about it.  As another example (it was on Seinfeld last night), let's say a waitress seemed like she flipped me off and I took it super personally.  Instead of making a big deal about it and blowing it even more out of proportion, I know that it's stupid, and I'd rather wait it out and let it go away on it's own, because any attention it gives is too much and will only make it last longer.

And don't take this the wrong way - it's not that you can't help or that your help isn't wanted.  It's just that sometimes people need to deal with things the way they need to deal with things, not the way *you* want them to deal with things."

2) Yeah it's gonna be fun when you accidentally knock those off and shatter them trying to get one of them out.

3) Ok, I'll just go out and find two perfectly sized bulldog clips instead of laying my keyboard flat. That sounds simpler.

4) Because drawers are designed to be used as counters and will suffer no damage whatsoever!

5) Just tap the edge of the lid on something, no need to waste tape

6) If you're recycling your kitchen waste, and emptying things before you throw them away there's no need to add a newspaper to a landfill site every time you change the binbag.

7) Sure, because iPads are really cheap and those plastic hooks are infallible!

8) Ok, that one I might actually use. Or wait - I could just remember to use clothes like an adult!

9) Use a lazy Susan to reduce your fridge space by approximately 1/5!

12) How to waste an inch of tape every time you use it!

13) Because just sticking it in your mouth and pulling the meat off isn't fiddly enough!

14) ......

15) Right, because boot uprightness is essential and cannot be achieved with a bit of cardboard you got off a box you don't need.

16) You can buy these pretty cheaply. No need to butcher a coat hanger and create extra plastic waste.

17) No complaints here, baking soda is actually awesome.

18) Because no one ever heard of drawers. Or triangular hangers.

19) If you're not wiping spills off your microwave when they're fresh you're doing it wrong.

20) LPT - pretty much any substance you can name tastes better than Hershey's.

21) Fire, so nice to have in the home...

22) This doesn't work. Just buy a goddamn glass.

23) I'm sure the child who gets the smaller half will be delighted with your ingenuity.

24) Airing bedding regularly should be a no brainer. 

25) This is about the most fiddly and wasteful way you can clean a keyboard. Just turn it upside down and bang it like everyone else. Or use a nice reusable paintbrush to dislodge dirt.

26) Or just play with your child in the tub seeing as you're not meant to leave them unattended anyway

27) If this is for garden use it is going to be annoyingly small. If it's for house plants you'd be better off with a watering can with a spout so you don't get splashback from the leaves. If you want to wet the leaves put your plants in the tub once a month and shower them down.

28) I have no words.

29) This will last approximately two weeks. Use a proper underlay.

30) Warm soda and cool pizza!

31) Ok that's kind of inventive.

32) I can see this going wrong, but it would be entertaining, so I'm ok with it.

33) How does anyone who owns a blender not know this?

34) Rest your laptop on something flimsy and flammable! What could go wrong!

35) This is not a life hack.

36) That looks repulsive.

37) Scissors??? Or perhaps the little perforations designed for tearing it open? You know, the ones hidden behind the coins?

38) Hello wasted petrol and unexpected flammability!

Russian_Surrender,investing,1389201541.0,"Perhaps my reference was a little vauge.  Everything you say is absolutely true **today**.  But in 1999, when Amazon was trading at the same levels that Twitter is today (and Google didn't even exist), everything that is being said about twitter today could be said about Amazon.

But here's the kicker, in most instances, people were right about what they said about (companies like) Amazon.  Amazon turned out to be the survivor.  But peapod, prodigy, literallly thousands of others that have long been forgotten?  Yeah, people were right when they said that those companies didn't stand a chance and that Wall Street just didn't understand the internet.

So the question really is, is Twitter ""the one""?  Is it Amazon, or is it Peapod?  If you believe it is Amazon, the valuation is reasonable.  If you believe it is Peapod, no valuation is reasonable."

Eolond,AskReddit,1389201566.0,"I found that removing hair from my brush every day helps.  I also finger comb it when it has conditioner in it, as it is a good way to catch shedding hairs.  I make sure to brush mine several times throughout the day so the brush can get the hair that would normally just fall to the ground.

I should mention that I never blow dry or use hairspray or any other styling products in my hair, so I'm not sure if that prevents shedding at all.

I also found that putting my hair into a bun (I brush it back like I would a ponytail, but then I twist it around itself) keeps me from getting the heavy-hair headaches.

I do admit that air-drying it can be annoying.  Nothing worse than a head of wet hair on a cold day, but my hair will frizz the fuck out if I use a dryer.  I've found that if I spend a few minutes really squeezing the water out (working from the scalp to the ends, instead of just focusing on the ends) helps reduce the drying time."

MasterBalloonier,TalesFromRetail,1389201638.0,"A lot of retail stores do have CCTV, but its generally cheap, analogue and with a very low frame rate. Very rarely, if ever, are there people watching the feeds. Even if a recording is reviewed to identify shoplifters etc its such low quality that its barely helpful.

Generally I think the bulk of the cameras are in public/public-ish places. City centres/airports/train stations are all covered in them. Airports in particular do their best to cover every square inch.

That said, a lot of the time the cameras are old/low quality/not being watched. I know that certain government sites have a list of approved products which is so out-dated that some listed products aren't even produced any more - but they aren't allowed to buy the new, good stuff. And that's without taking into account the ratio of cameras to operators - so, so much goes unseen due to the people watching having too many screens and not enough focus.

/r/GetMotivated

/r/seduction (watch this one, they can help you be more social but some of the stuff they suggest is pretty sleazy)

Start exercising, get out of your house and be social with friends. Try and find a hobby group or club you can join with your interests. If you want to get over your fear of isolation etc: Try and talk to at least one new person each day. In line at the store? Make small talk with the person in front of you ""It's freezing outside. Lucky I even got the car started this morning haha"". If you can't think of anything, watch Sportscenter and just bring up something random you heard. That's what I used to do. Go to the mall and walk around and smile at everyone you see. Do this a few times then move up to saying ""Hi"" and that's it. If they decide to talk to you, that's great, if not, who cares?!

In the adult world nobody cares where you live, tbh. If somebody does they are pretty shallow. Everybody has their own circumstances. If it makes you nervous, don't even bring it up. Don't make a big deal about it if it comes up and don't act embarrassed.

As for this particular girl: Probly wont work. Distance, etc. But that's not to say you dont have a chance. It is just logistically an issue. I dont see any harm in just keeping on talking to her like you have been online, unless its awkward now for some reason.

Sending a human being to Mars will cost billions of dollars. Of course, that's assuming you want them to actually land and live for any period of time.

Key reason to go with this civ is to try and learn what you messed up playing as the other civs you played as and see how your choices impact the game.

pathein_mathein,AskHistorians,1389201955.0,"The slightly jokey answer is [Cermak road](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-03-07/news/ct-met-kass-0307-20130307_1_chicago-way-anton-cermak-chicago-politics), named after the former mayor assassinated in a botched attempt against FDR...except that Chicagoans (and FDR himself) have always contended that the assassin was out for Cermak anyway as he was a reformer and shooting him in front of the President was just chutzpah. Then again, the question is whether Cermak was that much of a reformer anyway as opposed to someone who was against the Outfit or Italian organized crime. Whatever side you come down on the facts of the assassination, there's clearly a sly joke in the choice of naming that particular street that goes straight to Cicero.

I have trouble answering the question to the extent that I don't know about the history of Vegas so I don't have a point of comparison there. The other problem is that major corruption in Chicago pre-dates, or at least is synchronous with, the rise of the Outfit and mob power, so you get to question what's a criminal organization and what's just politics.

If you look at something like [the Burnham plan](http://burnhamplan100.lib.uchicago.edu/), which clearly shaped the face of the City dramatically, it comes off as a high progressive thing and hardly the sort of project you'd associate with vice. But the at the same time, politicians realized it was an unparalleled opportunity for graft. This sort of trend would continue. Public works were basically Daley's *panem et circenses*, and there was a widespread notion that corruption was justified as long as the corrupt gave the City itself it's cut, hence [the Picasso](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-chicagodays-picasso-story,0,1344585.story), but probably more importantly countless other little projects to put City work in the face of the electorate and distract from the overt organized crime ties.

Now, is that organized crime building Chicago? Not really, insomuch as I understand the mob businesses to be the prime drivers of what was going on in Vegas in terms of bringing the business in the absence of the other failing businesses. Chicago was a center of industry and transit, it just so happens that it also had a vice industry. Likewise, there's the question of whether there's anything special about the mafia-as-the-mafia, and whether these are byproducts of the culture of corruption, and, notably, to question the corruption itself as being in any way necessary.

So your safest assumption is that organized crime (in one variation or the other) and the legitimate political leadership of Chicago were *cough* so intertwined that distinguishing the acts of one or the other is a less relevant distinction to make, even when there aren't any specific mob goals at stake.

(Sources: Gus Russo's ""The Outfit"" is a great overview of the growth and development of the Chicago Outfit. James Marrimer's ""Grafters and Goo-Goos"" is a great history of corruption, reform, and as is his constant refrain, how you often can't decide who's which in Chicago. There's a lot of Mike Royko that touches on this, but in particular here some of the columns in the ""For the Love of Mike"" collection, his WBEZ interview, and ""Boss."")"

I have also used their contact us section to great effect, as well as calling them directly.  They are always helpful and do their best to solve any problems I have.

Make sure you evaluate how much a charge is going to cost you as part of your ""cheaper"" question.. shopify by default uses Stripe, at a 2.5%+30 cents rate..  if you end up using a merchant account with BigCommerce you will likely have monthly fees for the merchant account and processor accounts on top of a similar per transaction fee.

Stripe has a 8 day hold on money, some merchant accounts put a rolling hold of a percentage (i.e. like 10% of all money) as holdback, so thats something else to consider in the equations as well."

In 2006 CJR boards were prevalent in almost every AFSC that wasn't Security Forces or some other outside-the-wire job. There was a massive drawdown after the Gulf War as well. Hell, many believe the only reason the PT Test came to be in 04 and then the updated Pass/Fail portions was to help weed out fatties so they didn't even have to do another cut. 

This is what happens when conflicts in two theaters are drawing to a complete close. What are you expecting? That 300k people will populate the CONUS/OS bases in your AFSC and you'll only have to work 40 hours a week? Not gonna happen. 

I know it sucks, and I've gone through this make believe ""Hunger Games"" thing that is circulating on Facebook and Reddit before.

ThePrevailer,explainlikeimfive,1389202018.0,"Century? Thousands of years. They trace the fight all the way back to Genesis. God promises Israel to Abraham and Sarah's* descendants. Abraham and his wife are in their 90s. She can't have kids so she tells him to sleep with one of her servants. He does and they have a kid, Ishmael. God says, ""No, dummy, I said with your wife."" He has a kid, Isaac, with his 95 year old wife. 

Abraham's inheritance is Israel. Muslims say Ishmael is the heir. Jews/Christians say Isaac is the rightful heir. They've been fighting over who God gave Israel to for thousands of years. Every Israeli/Palestinian conflict boils down to this. 

For the conflict in the last hundred years, it goes back to when the Ottoman Empire was broken up and Israel was created again out of nowhere. The Jews had been driven out of Israel at one point, and outsiders gave it back to them. This pissed off lots of Arabs, who are still mad."

So you typically spend more than you'll get back.  When it comes to expenses you can never hope to pay, it's worth losing money, because it means you didn't incur a crippling expense.

A rule of thumb is: if you want to lose money (because the alternative is worse), the insurance worth getting.  If you hope to benefit financially, you are wasting money."

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,MakeupAddiction,1389202028.0,"It's called acting. It's not about who the actor is in real life, it's about who can best portray the character on screen. It's not always true that someone who is closer to the character in real life is better at emoting that understanding. Many real life couples have horribly chemistry onscreen, and many people who hate each other come off amazingly onscreen. It's also about what name can bring audiences into the theater, and Jared Leto is a name they can put up on a poster. 

Just as gay actors should be able to play straight roles, straight people should be able to play gay roles. Should Neil Patrick Harris not be allowed to play Barney because he is gay in real life? Portia De Rossi awful in Ally McBeal and Arrested Development? Was Sean Penn horrible in Milk? 

I feel like we should be happy that a transgendered character has even been brought to the big screen in a mainstream hollywood movie. That's huge. Making it controversial because a straight man was cast seems counter to wanting to see more characters like this portrayed in movies. If we really want to see more characters like this we need to support movies like this. They are already worried about how movies with ""controversial"" characters are going to be accepted by middle america, by making them even more controversial in the lgbt community just makes hollywood less likely to explore the gender spectrum. Where as if everyone said ""yay! this is awesome! Let's see more. And by the way, here are some amazing trans actors we'd also like to see more of! Which attitude do you think people would respond to better?

I'd also be more interested to see a transgendered woman play a ~~real~~ woman onscreen rather than a transgendered one. To me that would be something. Seeing a trans woman play a trans woman means they will be pigeonholed into those roles. But seeing a trans woman in a straight role would be the ultimate.

It's definitely easy to find it annoying, but the fact of the matter is she's usually right!

The other thing I will say is get used to people being really weirded out and confused about your dog. Most people who grew up with super friendly family dogs do not understand our dog and think she's super aloof and needy. To us, she's super loyal and the perfect working dog. On the flip side, all the trainers we've worked with think she's super smart and awesome, so it's definitely just a very different relationship than most dog owners are used to. I grew up with working animals so to me it's way more satisfying.

The fact that she only apologizes ""sometimes"" is sickening. In fact, it's pretty awful that she *needs* to apologize for her actions in the first place. She's a grown-ass woman. Talk to her. Then videotape her the next time she comes home drunk. If she acts up, show her the tape and leave. If she gets physical, show it to the cops.

SelfMadeSoul,AskReddit,1389202248.0,"In 2003, I met a man in his 50s at a party who was telling my friends and I that he was very irate with the US Military. He explained that he personally had exclusive information as to the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, despite the fact that he had neither any ties to the Middle East, Islam, nor did he have any basic understanding of the Geography of the Middle East. He couldn't tell us what it was that he knew, of course, as it was ""classified"". The reason that he was so upset originally was that the Navy Recruiter that he had called would not forward him to ""The Navy Seals"". 

When I asked him why he didn't attempt to contact Department of Defense Intelligence instead, he started stammering then shouted at me ""THEM SPIES DONT KILL BIN LADEN, BOY! THE NAVY SEALS KILL BIN LADEN!""

atrain728,civ,1389202423.0,"Protecting cargo ships can be an issue, but Barbarians are mostly only an issue in the early game when ship travel is limited to coastal waters.

With that in mind, Barbarian ships are going to spawn in one of two places, between you and your target cities (I usually target city states in this early phase), or somewhere else. Barbarians can't spawn in explored territory, and - before harbor - your cargo ships can't go too far anyway. So I try to keep the coastline between me and my target cities ""explored"" so that there are no camps showing up there.

And if they do, dispatch them quickly.

On the other side, I always make two triremes - one for guarding each end-point. Since barbarian travel is limited early to the coast-line, I send my ships in each direction along the coast-line to block any barbarian triremes from heading towards my shipping lanes.

This is harder with more complex geometry/geology, but the alert mechanism on ships that are cleverly dispatched to limit access to your shipping zone works pretty well to keep barbarians out.

When your empire gets a little bigger, and older, you'll want to have a larger navy to protect your cargo fleet - but your cargo fleet should also be producing a massive surplus for you at this point - so building/supporting that fleet should be doable with house money.

In this phase, there's far fewer places for barbarians to spawn. You can usually identify those places and keep an eye on them: If your ships are going across ocean tiles, look for any small uninhabited islands/coastline that might spawn a camp and put a ship there. If there's already a camp there, get rid of it, and then sit the ship near the area where the trade passes by the coast. No barbarians will spawn there - and alert will tell you when ships come near.

You'll get a roamer that knocks out a trans-continental ship every once in a while in the middle of the ocean, but it's pretty rare. But if you understand the mechanics and capabilities of barbarians, it's pretty easy to keep them at bay with limited cost."

The rhetoric of liberalism(you may call it differently over there) has been distilled(unfortunately) into: people do bad things, the state protects you(which on its self is hard to argue politically), and this gave access to a lot more prerogatives to modern states, now if you alternate that with the security oriented conservatives you get a ""relaxing massage done with iron gloves"". Tu sum up, the modern day dichotomy of liberalism and conservatism is similar in results with mild authoritarianism.


The second aspect is more sociological, because there are a lot of people that don't have individual free speech(actually have nothing to say), that don't have privacy they need protecting(the lack the shame) and that basically don't have interest divergent from the state. They genuinely, on an individual level, don't have any concerns, that was I feel a massive problem with communism, it educated, massively, and while stupid people are quite content just by having a societal role, once a person gets a ""big picture"", he will demand more and will not accept no for an answer."

Ostrololo,custommagic,1389202498.0,"I don't see coin flipping as inherently red. It's just a tool to add randomness to any mechanic that already belongs to a color. For flavor and historical reasons, most coin flipping cards are red, but there are also artifacts doing that. In this case, the sac clause when it becomes a target is a blue mechanic, so I feel comfortable adding the coin flip to fit the top-down flavor of quantum mechanics. If the card were red, it would break the color pie, as the sac clause isn't red.

As another example, [Tavern Swindler](http://magiccards.info/rtr/en/79.html) shows black doing coin flips within a context that makes sense for black."

For some, science is taboo. Just as creation is taboo for some scientists, science is taboo for some creationists. 

You have people who blindly believe science because it has the most evidence. What the hell does the evidence prove, if not that we do, in fact, exist? I can drop two balls of a different weight, and see that they land simultaneously. I accept that because that is how it is. I am no less wrong than you, even if you do math and physics to prove it.

I believe it because I see it, you believe it because you proved it. We believe the same thing, for different reasons. What does it boil down to? **That two balls of different weights land simultaneously**

You say she remains good friends with them in your original post in which case I think it's fine to invite them to the wedding. You two have been together for five years with (I'm assuming) no problems, why is this all-of-a-sudden freaking you out?

Realistically, the multiple options for killstreaks will be back.  I just hope they do it as well as they did with Black Ops 2.  Aside from the annoyance of having someone get a gunship, I can't really say I had too many complaints about the killstreaks in BO2."

Perhaps I lost a potential sale?  But what if Joe wouldn't have bought my song otherwise?  Then I really lost nothing.  Victimless.

Corporate shoplifting: a stolen sweater from Target costs each shareholder, employee and customer a couple orders of magnitude less than $0.001, the smallest legal currency denomination in the US.  In other words, they lose nothing.  There is no victim.

ScubaSteeeve,Trombone,1389203114.0,"Both a trumpet player and a trombonist here. It might help to know that unless the trombone you play has a fundamental tone of E-flat, you're still playing a tenor trombone. The ones with the trigger are still tenor trombones too (unless they're bass trombones, which tend to be larger and mostly have two triggers).

Semantics aside, while there's definitely some merit to the advice that you should stick with one instrument until a certain point, I'm going to go ahead and suggest a few tips that may help your intonation:

* The importance of breath support cannot be overstated. It affects many things, including your tone quality and your intonation. Your air stream should be strong and steady, even when you're playing softly.
* Check your embouchure in the mirror. A good buzz will do wonders for your intonation. Practice playing a piece using only your mouthpiece and buzzing the pitches (you'll need to know what the piece sounds like, though). Look for a steady, strong tone. Eventually, you'll even want to be able to buzz the pitches without the mouthpiece. The trombone is essentially a gigantic amplifier for your lips.
* The trombone is also basically a gigantic tuning slide. If you know a note is out of tune, you have a very easy way of adjusting its pitch. Definitely take advantage of this, at least as a stop-gap measure until your intonation improves.

Hope this helps."

So, you've LITERALLY unplugged other devices on 120v circuits?  The fridge for example could be across the house yet on the same circuit.  I don't trust breaker boxes to ever be labeled correctly unless I do it myself.  

I used an inductive toner to find outlets and lights on the same circuit and what breaker they were on.  Again I want to know how you went about testing which breakers the computers were on.  Flipping the breakers and testing which outlets have power counts.  

EDIT: I did a little research, and these things are apparently a real nuisance.  In addition, most computer power supplies are a bit ""dirty"" in that they generate noise on the AC line.  This is probably causing sensitive breakers to trip, regardless of load.  What I would try is running through a UPS that will guarantee clean power.  We had devices that did this when I worked in the system test lab, and I can't for the life of me remember what they're called.

The bad side is that as you get older you lose the hope and joy of  the future as the older you get the more you become rigid and fixed/ once you past a certain age you will not be an astronaut or movie star and you very much can realistically see how your life will pan out.

jpr64,Futurology,1389203553.0,"Not strictly news as they've been on this warpath for a number of years. I was fortunate to visit a few facilities in the Gobi desert during 2011 including a vast solar farm, turbine farms and a turbine production factory. Seeing those beasts under construction was impressive with the largest that factory was producing (at the time) a height of 120m. The length of the blades being hauled out from the factory was just extraordinary. 

From memory China has been the #1 produce of green energy for a while. The cost of solar panels is coming down because the technology is evolving and China controls the majority of the world's rare-earth metals that are required for solar. Unfortunately the US imposes trade tariffs on cheaper Chinese-made solar panels to protect the US industry (I'm sure their argument is currency manipulation related.)

In smaller homes solar water heating is a common sight in China, especially in rural areas. This is of course impossible for high-rise apartments in China where every apartment has a small electric hot water cylinder in each bathroom and every room in every building has an AC unit because central air/heating seems to be a non-existent concept that contributes to increased energy consumption, especially during the extremes of winter and summer.

Some have mentioned the smog in China. [This is the view](http://i.imgur.com/LvOdtVW.jpg) I had while working in Shanghai last month. That building silhouette you can barely see in the middle... that building was across the road.

[Here's how that level of smog is represented](http://i.imgur.com/jNQn5gP.jpg) in terms of the Air Quality Index which measures PM2.5
The WHO accepted safe level is about 25 (parts per meter cubed I believe). This scale maxes out at about 500. I took this screen shot of the AQI the same time I took the photo out the window.

carbidegriffen,AskMen,1389203682.0,"You broke the cycle when you divorced.  
When people are married it is a stable concept, you know who you live with, you know what it takes to get them to have sex or even convince them you should go to the beach for vacation this year instead of the lake where you go every year.  

People stop trying.  When you are dating you are trying, you would never think of trying to kiss her if you thought you had bad breath.  Married folks just roll over in the bed with morning breath and might try to kiss.  

It sounds to me you are getting the best of both worlds, you get to have your (ex)wife who you are comfortable and you have an open relationship.  
On the other hand if the two of you had realized this 20 years ago you might have had a much happier (sex filled) marriage.  

As far as getting more action now.  I think it's a few things.  First, as we age we stop caring what other people think.  So that girl that wouldn't sleep with you in HS for fear of being labeled a slut... she's realized that the enjoyment of sex is worth the slut label, but even then she doesn't care because she's getting some good action.  Furthermore there is a lower risk of getting pregnant, this can be a worry for people, lower the risk and libido goes up.  

Finally I think that most women figure out self confidence at a younger age, so they control the game when younger.  But once men figure it out they take it further, so as we age the control of the game shifts."

drummingbooming,AskReddit,1389203920.0,"I am a trans man (Female to Male), 20yo, pre surgeries but on hormones, documents legally changed and well past ""i think i pass"" stage. Loads of others have contributed with societal experiences in line with my own, so I won't add too much, but I'd like to bring up my personal experience with people who knew me both before *and* after transition.

People do listen more when I'm talking, and guys I know are more friendly/affectionate/inclusive - I get details on my coworkers personal lives or their detailed opinion on the ass of a woman walking by, I get asked for a cigarette when hanging out outside even though everybody knows I don't smoke, I hear bro/boss/dude/man/chief/buddy every other sentence from guys who KNEW me as a girl and were perfectly nice, but never particularly social. Girls who knew me before transition are interested in me/flirt now - and when I'm on a shift with mostly women, I no longer hear all the conversations debating the other guys we work with, who is the most appealing, etc. I'm sure those conversations are still happening, but I'm not in the girl zone anymore, even though I'm very open about having dated both men and women.

My friends from high school often seem curious about my ""transformation"" (when i met them i was a nerdy dweeby average teenage girl with a ponytail and big tits, now a young man with the same personality but facial hair and broad shoulders and a bit of a paunch) but do not ask me about my transition. And I'm a pretty casual, open guy, so I wouldn't mind - but there's no easy way to segue ""Just so you know, you can ask about The Operation and I won't get mad,"" when we're talking about video games or how school's going. 

Probably the funniest thing I've run into regarding people who KNOW about my transition and yet change the way they act around me completely: My (female) best friend's parents are not understanding about LGBT vein stuff at all (think my friend coming out in high school and getting ""you think you're a bisexual because of your PCOS causing brain imbalances"") and yet, after seeing me on hormones and whatnot, have adjusted perfectly to my new name and male pronouns, never mess it up...but they have set new rules in place as to my friend and I hanging out. I slept over once and the next day her father told her he wasn't comfortable with her having men sleep in her room and I would have to sleep on the couch next time. (Bear in mind we are 20 years old.) Her mother periodically comes in when we're alone in a room to check up on us. She pulled my friend aside once and said ""Now that drummingbooming is a man, I don't think it's appropriate for you to spend so much time alone behind closed doors.""

These are behaviors I never experienced as a girl. They're nothing I'd be surprised by now, but the fact that these people knew me before, know about my transition (as my mom put it, ""what is your dad afraid of? he doesn't have a penis! he can't get you pregnant!"") and have updated their backwards old-school stances on male/female friendships to be accepting of trans people. My friend even asked her father, ""so if my MTF friend slept over, it would be alright for us to share a bed?"" and his response was ""if she is mentally female of course that would be fine."" "

I don't like this type of business, but I still think Eugen is a very user-centric developer (look at all the support they give! Free DLC, weekly patches, actively talking to the community) and believe they so far have done a good job. We also didn't get the release date of RD yet, so I'd personally wait a bit more to be that skeptic as you are.

All the information I got came from 3 places: Their official Facebook page, the official forums and the DevBlog they had for quite some time (it began during WAB, I think). Links will be at the end of the post.

I also have in mind that Eugen isn't as big as DICE or Bethesda, they have less resources and recycle some assets from previous games. But in practice so many developers do that! I don't think it's a problem, why would I ask them to remodel the same damn tank again? I'd rather they gave us more of what is already good than to spend development resources into redoing what they already had. That's personal, again.

Don't know if you had actually played WAB, so maybe you should try it and see how close to WEE it is. In WAB all units are unlocked from day 1 and you have the freedom to choose whatever you want and still win. Of course, some people want to min-max and end with the same old units everytime, but many - like me - try to vary and have fun with different, sometimes crazy decks. For example, I just came from a match in which me and my friend had Russian Cat B decks while the opponents had american and Danish cat B or C. It doesn't have to be Mixed Nato vs USSR cat A all the time.

The balance in WAB right now is the best it has ever been. And yes, there are around 800 units ingame, maybe you haven't seen it because people

I suggested he go to /r/Judaism, as nobody in this sub would know the answer. He then said 'apparently Jews don't know answers"". When he insisted that I was dodging the question, I said ""here are some resources that answer the question"". When he insisted that the resources are not what he wants, I realized he was doing one big ""gotcha"". 

To be clear, I did not remove his post for not following something I as a user suggested. I did remove his post for effectively saying ""no experts exist here, so no experts exist"" which made it clear to me he was not being honest.

This is something I wondered myself, on a more abstract level. With the advent of technology, particularly in cosmetics and surgery, a lot of people in advanced societies might eventually need to re-assess at how important physical beauty is to an LTR.

The mere fact that it exists as an option and is becoming cheaper, safer, more effective, and more widely accepted around the world … that itself begins to put an increasingly tangible price on beauty. It'll be easier to compare the value of it to other traits.

Currently we waste [about a third](http://www.unep.org/wed/quickfacts/) of all food produced, but even then - how many people does it take to get to where we cannot support ourselves? If I run a farm, I don't just make enough to eat year to year. I make more than enough, so that my family is comfortable knowing if anything date strophic happens, there's a food store. But we also have more kids, since we have the food to spare. Others do the same. So we work to squeeze as much yield from our crops as possible. Instead of stabilizing, we don't increase our food stores so much as we do our population (for more on this idea read Daniel Quinn's *Ishmael*)

""Progress"" (namely, ease of transportation, shipping, factory farming and developments in agronomy) has created a place where we can produce enough food to support (sort of) ~7billion people. In addition, we produce thousands upon thousands of tons of pollutants, contaminants, toxins and waste. We make things we don't want, we buy things we don't need, and we throw away stuff that nobody ever asked for in the first place. In our desperation for natural resources, we've blown up the mountains of West Virginia to find coal for our power plants, enslaved Africans to mine for rare earth elements for our cell phones and diamonds for our engagement rings, and poisoned our drinking water in Pennsylvania trying to frack every last useful bit of crude. Not to mention the tar sands of Canada, offshore drilling and spills like Deepwater Horizon, and the danger of spills during transport - [pipelines](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/07/us-usa-exxon-fine-idUSBRE9A603X20131107), [trains](http://www.midwestenergynews.com/2014/01/07/in-north-dakota-oil-train-explosion-a-wake-up-call/) and [tankers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oil_spills). 

I'm not promoting Luddism - but I am saying this blind, fantastic notion of ""progress"" is oblivious to all the reservations that ""simplistic living"" and it's acolytes promote.

TIGit,Automate,1389204338.0,"&gt; crappy factory production job you had before.

I see you're not too familiar with a lot of factory jobs. In many areas the factories pay better than any other local business, have better benefits, and employ large percentages of a town/city's population. When minimum wage is $7.25 and hour the factory job paying $18 looks pretty good.

&gt; All I see is whine whine whine... people's jobs get axed every day, all day long, for a wide variety of reasons. Deal with it. It's life.

See this is where empathy and compassion are important. These are people's livelihoods, real human suffering. We build the automation systems, we take away their jobs. That's culpability. We have a moral responsibility as fellow human beings to enact our automation in ways that benefit society rather than cause needless heartbreak. Saying ""deal with it"" is callous, and childishly petty. It's reckless.

&gt; Life will never bow down to your whims, or anyone else's

I never asked it to. I will however continue to personally drive automation in manufacturing in a humane way, it's not something I impose on ""Life"", but a responsibility I recognize as my own. Don't be glib and careless with people's lives is a fairly just way to act as a person. 

&gt; your role in things is ultra small.

My role is not small to the people I displace. Yes, in the grand scheme my works are not grand nor prolific. But my automation implementation impacts real lives down to their foundations, the basic ability to shelter and feed themselves is risked. To the workers that role is huge, it's terrifying. And I act with caution because I am aware and cognizant of such. I build automation for dangerous conditions. I save hands and fingers and legs and lives. I do not act frivolously to destroy jobs, but rather to reduce the cost of human suffering. Automation isn't evil, but used callously and with the intent to eliminate workers for profit it becomes an evil."

Imagine the pressing feeling of the concrete as it slowly creeps up your body. The metal casket it too slick to climb out. Your feet are being pressed down. Eventually, your arms are too heavy to lift up, and they get trapped in the creeping cement. It is now up to your neck. You realize you should try to hold your breath to maybe last a little longer. The concrete is now over your head. You can't see, you can't breathe, and you can only hear the sound of more and more cement piling on top of you. Your lungs are burning with the need to breathe. Eventually your body automatically pushes the air out of your lungs. This causes the concrete to fill your open mouth. You feel the heavy, viscous liquid crawl down your airway and fill your aching lungs. You die suffocating, surrounded and filled by a lifeless mass of ever-hardening stone.

And if that weren't enough, your metal and stone grave is thrown to the bottom of a river. No one knows where your body is, no one knows where you went. If someone were to ever stumble across the metal box that contains your immobilized corpse, there would be no way of knowing that you are in it.

Supershinyface,xxfitness,1389204384.0,"First off, thanks for coming over here to reply. FCJ is a confusing place.

I suspect the image of the instructor was chosen because of her age, since images of older people are also difficult to find. The selection of images was pretty carefully curated to show a broad range of races as well. Given how many images there were, I don't think anyone would have noticed one less to the point that the author felt the need to 'pad' with one more. 

Look, I'm not saying weight loss isn't ever desirable, and I'm not saying calorie restriction isn't necessary. I'm saying that stuff sucks. If it didn't suck for some people, no one would ever get fat except people with weird tumors. 

When you are fat, you are constantly bombarded with this idea that you must lose weight to be considered a real person. That if you can just lose weight, your life can then begin, become worthwhile, have meaning. (If you don't believe me, read through here and people totally flabbergasted at the idea that you would ever tell fat people anything else!) God, that has to get so tiresome.

What I thought was cool about this collection is that it demonstrates that you can go out and do things, try things *including physically very demanding things* even while you're fat. 

There's a triathlete that posted somewhere in this thread, and she'd like to lose some weight. I would posit that it's much easier to stay motivated for something like that when you're focused on performing better at a sport you already know you enjoy than when you hope if you can just lose enough maybe you'll be allowed to try one of these sports without people giving you shit for it. 

My goal with this thread wasn't to present this as superior to any other representation of fitness, but as supplemental to it, and that's a big part of why I'm so surprised and disappointed at the reaction. I posted it on Newbie Tuesday, hoping to show any new year's folks what they might be capable of in their current shapes, and to start a discussion around how they should keep at it. What happened instead was a lot of reinforcement of the idea that you have no business attempting to be fit unless you have first mastered being thin - which is pretty sad. "

hermithome,TwoXChromosomes,1389204405.0,"If someone comes from Hawaii to Texas they might very well hate the weather *all over Texas*. Yes, there's regional variation, but again, this all comes down to the specificity of the complaint.

Most of the time when I complain about the weather I blame my specific local. But not always. I've named both my state and larger. You're assuming that you know what's bugging /u/kornberg and that these are traits specific to Houston. But you could very well be wrong. /u/kornberg could legitimately hate all of Texas. Or their complains might be about things not specific to Austin. And notice, you've completely ignored the political aspect of their complaint, an aspect that is very much state specific.

It doesn't really matter what their complaint is though. You're ignoring the parts of their complaint that are state specific, are making large assumptions about the rest and all around, you're policing someone else's complaint. That's kinda nuts.


**EDIT:** Look I get that you like your state and dislike the rap it gets that other states don't.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389204449.0,"I may have given the wrong impression, and plus, it's not necessarily a bad thing...

For one, if I didn't notice a girl, maybe she was into me for whatever reason but I had too much going on and didn't notice anything.  I opened a restaurant once at a resort (out of state) with a buddy of mine, and almost from the start, this girl was into me.  I worked with a lot of girls, and I just never gave too much thought to it because I was too busy with the restaurant at the time.  I had to give someone a ride somewhere and it was a couple hours away, but I didn't know my way around.  I pretty much recruited her to take a ride with me, so of course she was happy to go.  I bought her dinner for helping me out, and we ended up hanging out for hours, and that started our relationship.  It was a complete accident that turned out really well - had she approached me earlier, I totally would have been into it, but I didn't think of her that way at the time.  But that doesn't mean I was against thinking of her that way, it just hadn't crossed my mind (at least not yet).

Plus, two people don't need to be super into each other at first - one can show interest and the other can reciprocate.  I guess ""open to giving it a shot"" is a terrible way to put it, because it's not what I meant.  Imagine someone comes up to you at a wedding and says ""here, would you like a crabcake?""  Maybe you would LOVE a crabcake, but until you were offered, it wasn't on your mind, because you didn't know it was an option.

PeachesMarie,AskReddit,1389204462.0,"Oh man I hope I'm not too late!

I had a friend who-I shit you not- believed she was the Seer Cassandra (as in, from the Greek myths) reborn, that she has lived hundreds of lives in Rome, Greece, Egypt, and so forth, that she could see and communicate with those that have passed on, and that she was literally put on this earth to choose a side and fight for it (good or evil, it depended on the reincarnation). She told me she has faced the devil and even God himself, and always fought for humanity's sake.

Oh and one night she got drunk with my roommate, when I had dinner plans with my boyfriend. It wasn't until I told her it was time for me to go and she needed to stay and sober up with the roomie that she decides to tell me that Apollo, whom she claimed gave her her powers, had returned and was out to get her and destroy the world or some such nonsense. 

I've always been a believer in the existence of some other power in the universe but holy shit that was too much. That night she got drunk with my roommate was the night I decided not to be friends with her anymore even though we had all of our classes together. I was trying to keep it up until the end of the semester since there were only 10 of us in the major and it was easier, in my mind, to just stick it out until we didn't have to be around each other all the time. 

Seriously, she actually believed all of this shit she spewed. We were seniors in college!"

Sir_Fancy_Pants,AskReddit,1389204484.0,"taking pictures of monuments or building when on holiday, seriously almost everyone who goes to a landmark will waste their time taking a picture of the monument (with nobody in it)

I hate to break it to you but the picture you took has no more value to you than any picture available anywhere online from the same time period the only pictures you will every care about when you are older are pictures of people.

what the Eiffel tower looked like on may the 23rd 1995, will be so meaningless to you, it isn't even worth looking at.

Only people, and peoples impact on things will matter, so a typical street scene with many people and styles and products of the time will be of interest to you, but something like the pyramids or a significant landmark that is changeless will be of no value to you whatsoever.

edit: I find it hilarious how many of you down voted this, if you think there is value in a picture of a monument (that is identical to every other) simply because you took it, your life must be absolutely tragic.

GoNavy_09,guns,1389204510.0,"I don't know if I like that thy can do that, but I suppose you have a point that they probably don't care about some random guy buying a 70 year old rifle when there are people buying guns from cartels and what not. I'll definitely think about it, especially since it can save so much money on the various things I need, be it the guns themselves or websites that sell parts on discount. I believe JG Sales gives discounts to C&amp;R holders do they not? 
That's really neat you are doing that, but where in the world did you get a gun for $38?? Repair or not that is an incredible deal! 
Best deal I ever got was a Type 38 Arisaka for $200 at a pawn shop, guy didn't know what he had. This Arisaka is all original, no import stamp, mum in tact and is in almost the same condition it was in when whoever brought it back picked up off a Japanese soldier. It is actually better than any Arisaka I have seen at any museum, including the Smithsonian. Its one of the crown jewels so to speak of my collection. Someone must have told the store owner what a deal I got though because he has never been as friendly since then and even his junkiest, most beat up last ditch rifles are $400+ now. He's had the same rifles for a few years just because no one will pay that much money for a rusted last ditch that is beyond repair. I've considered buying a beat up last ditch and removing as much rust as I can and maybe rebluing it and putting a new stock on so that it can last for longer before it just rusts away, but even a last ditch is too pricy for me now. 
Would you still be willing to sell that one Czech stock you found? It may not be an original Gew98 stock but I can keep it in that until I find what I need. Then I can use the Czech stock to build myself a Czech Mauser. My only other alternative is buy a Turkish stock or leave it in the bubba stock. I'm not even sure if the Turkish stock would work either because though the Turk K. Kale is a large ring Mauser I believe the barrel is at one point the width of a small ring and so that may cause problems. But I don't know if that is true or not. 
I have a question as to if this would be a good deal or not, I found [this](http://www.armslist.com/posts/2395808/minneapolis-minnesota-rifles-for-sale--mauser-8mm) and the seller says the bolt, barrel, receiver, etc is unmodified. Then I could put it on a stock like [this one](http://www.continentalmilitaria.com/zbozi-180-(No.28)-Mauser-Kar-98K-rifle-stock-in-laminated-wood). Would that be a worthwhile deal? Or not so much? 
I definitely understand what you mean about quantity, but like you pointed out I am history guy, so even if I can't practically shoot all of them I'm okay with that. They are pieces of history and I want to preserve them for future generations and appreciate them for the master craftsmanship that was put into them. I would like to be able to shoot them all, but if I can't, I won't be too heartbroken. I also intend on having children who I will raise to appreciate history and who will get to inherit my collection once I and my wife (well, soon to be fiance right now) pass away. I'm sorry you won't have that same situation. :( 
I suppose you could donate them to a museum in your will. So that other people can appreciate them. 
I really do love the Mauser rifles. There is just something about them. Thats the same reason I like the Arisaka, its just a Japanese Mauser! And don't get me wrong I'd love to have a Carcano, a Lee Enfield, etc. But I don't necessarily want every single version of it like I do a Mauser. If I find one for a good price I'll for sure by it, but I'm not on a hunt for them like I am the Mausers. 
Thank you so much for helping me and being willing to help me out with parts and stocks that I may need. It'll be nice to have someone with what I need who won't charge three times what the part is worth like so many of the pirates online and at shows. And I completely understand that this is just a hobby, I would never try to get you to do something that would take up too much time or anything like that! :)

Doesn't matter. The original argument is that culture can place pressures on people that makes it difficult to get out of uncomfortable situations. This is demonstrably true. This makes kino suddenly seem very predatory, and does not reflect well on TRP's reaction to the woman OP is talking about."

I assume that he and RGIII have learned from the ""too close relationship"" and reporting going on, and that will fade quickly too.

He doesn't seem to want to keep doing the same thing and get different results - he's changing his direction.

Now, I'm not sure hiring a former GM for the Raiders is a good idea, given their scouting and drafting history, but I like Allen, and I'm willing to give him a shot running things.

These people had bombs (shitty ones ok) and some guns. But who cares how weak the bombs or guns are, all it takes is one or two more people killed and the outrage would be in the opposite direction. Earlier in the night they showed they were willing an able to kill others as they shot that campus security guard. 

Edit: after a bit of research there are accounts on both side of the story, some people were asked and declined, some were not, I cannot find any accounts of people not letting them in and the police forcing their way in. sounds like some police followed protocol and others didnt, what else is new. this was not something handed down from the government explicitly telling them to act unlawfully."

Or they're simply not willing to give up the comfort of what they know to take a risk and go. Most people just make excuses why they can't.

""I can't move because this is where my job is."" You're right you'll have to find a new job, and finding a job in San Diego is tough, but I did it, thousands of people have done it.

""I can't move because all my friends are here and I won't know anyone there."" Suck it up, you'll make new friends, maybe even better ones :-)

""I can't move because this is where my family is."" True, it's nice to be near your family but you don't *have* to be (usually). Is being miserable for 4-6 months out of the year worth living 15 minutes away from your mom? Or would you rather live in paradise 12 months out of the year and visit your mom just once or twice during that time? It's all about compromise.

""I can't move because I don't have the money."" Build a plan, make a budget and *make it work*. I was flat broke when I decided I wanted to move to San diego. But I busted my ass working overtime, saved up every cent I could and in 4 months I had enough money for the drive across the country and a down payment on an apartment.

Yes, I realize that there are some times that you actually **can't** just pick up and move, but those reasons are rare. Most people just *think* they can't move but anyone can; you just have to make the decision, make a plan and DO IT.

Omegaile,changemyview,1389205022.0,"&gt;It seems like every day I see a new article about cancers being suppressed or HIV being destroyed by removing some protein or implementing some fix.

First of all, news sources are not very reliable. They are business like any other and publish things they think will get audience. So while they don't blatantly lie, they exaggerate things, and you get the impression that technology is making huge breakthroughs very often. I remember the media hype when a LHC experiment showed something faster than light, and it turned out as an experiment error. All I'm getting here is that media is not a reliable source for science. Science happens through numerous replications, and not single heroic breakthroughs, like the media would like.

Now on the conspiracy. It's true that big pharmaceutical companies wouldn't profit from a cancer cure. And that's why they don't invest on it. Their labs research things they can profit on.

But what about University labs? They do research too, don't have the same constraints the pharmaceutical industry has, and one can pretty much argue that they are much more innovative. Now do you think Big Pharma will buy the cure from them? From the Universities, the Government? And the researchers wouldn't spill out? If I knew the cure for cancer and wasn't allowed to speak of it, I'd tell Snowden.

But lets assume that they really manage to buy everything. Well that's a bummer, but do you know what, Americans usually overestimate the global importance of the things that are important in US. I myself have never heard of ""Big Pharma"" until I started using reddit. Now it may be true that pharmaceutical companies are big on other countries too, but not everywhere. In many places, the ones doing medical research are public funded Universities, and the lobbies in the government have nothing to do with it (and in fact some would seem alien to US residents)."

I wasn't around to even enjoy the black cleaver buffs but like a week before it was nerfed.

They should have realized that since the black cleaver had made him so much more viable that he needed *something* to stay at a decent level.

With so few players that play Talon, and the varying skill levels of them, I don't see why they use his winrate statistics at all. Free-week usage is a factor, and there are quite a few players that have a good winrate with him but have played him for ages.

He needs something. After all the mana nerfs, damage nerfs, and I think he even had some of the time he stays invisible for his ult taken away, he needs something to feel more ""whole"". 

I saw a neat suggestion recently. Making his W similar to Yasuo's E-Q combo, in that if you use it immediately after cutthroat it'd then become a circular AoE for a second or two. Would be cool if that could be messed around with, at least."

mrangeloff,AskReddit,1389205053.0,"When I was about 21, I skipped an year at uni and told people that I travelled. Nothing interesting so much, but when they asked where, I answered that I served the Red Cross and was flight attendant for rescue and diplomatic missions in Honduras (since it is the poorest continental country in the Western Hemisphere and is far as fuck from where I am from). I also used to get off the plane and travelled with the trucks, filled with goods like food and clothes. A lot of girls believed, and I got lucky with some of them, which was the main purpose.
I got all the details with the vomiting because of the Central-American food; all the crew and other colleagues with their names. I told them there were no pics because the missions were secret because we were afraid that the drug lords and other institutions would find out. I told them our boss got shot in Venezuela after a deal with the company to merge with bigger company (AeroHonduras really became part of Aeropostal, based in Venezuela).
I got all the details about the cities and the roads from flickr and google maps.
The saddest part of all this stuff was I have never been in the Western hemisphere. I've only been in four countries in EU.

And actually in that year I was a waiter and earned more than the salary in the Honduras story.

Now looking back that was stupid thing to do, but hey, it worked. And I learned a valuable lesson - Nevermind what stories you have in life, it's the way you tell them that counts.

TL; DR Was in Latin America helping the poor while actually working as a waiter. All this shit for sex."

* WarGame: Airland Battle - 29 May 2013

   * Was announced Aug 2012, ~9 months before release

* WarGame: Red Dragon - 2014

   * Was [announced](http://www.rtsguru.com/article/6500/Wargame-Red-Dragon-Eugens-Alexis-Le-Dressay-on-The-Third-Wargame-Title.html) around Aug 2013?

      * Release would be around May 2014 according pattern

   * ~~Was announced Jan 2014~~

      * ~~Release in September if we follow pattern~~

Makes me to expect few DLC packs for RD, free or not, and then new WarGame announcement for 2016 release.

I am not against re-using assets, but this rapid release cycle of new 40 € tittles just gives me bitter taste into mouth. It's jut personal cynical / skeptical thing in the end and will see how RD pans out. After this announcement I have no interest to touch Airland Battle because I know next major release is months away.

Also I admit Wargame: EE really burned me with initial super bad balance, how badly devs handled it [took too long to get anything major done to it] and by then I was expected to have everything open and mastered all cheese and min max. Sucked interest and fun out of it :/

When game like MoW: AS 2 or WarGame pop on to the map I try follow them little bit as these *different* RTS games are more my thing than e.g. StarCraft 2.

We see a tremendous saving on the power bill (-10%), which is a lot given that most power goes to IT stuff in our house, but after a couple of weeks, it's clear that you need to be careful when planning and buying.

In one of the sockets, the LED bulb exploded now the second time in a few weeks. The capacitor bursts and pushes out the LED pcb, the front glass and whatever else out like a nice party popper. OK, probably some issue with the installation (what exactly?), but the halogen bulb before LED was nice and bright for years.

Another lamp with 5 sockets, one of the bulbs has turned yellow and dim after around 10 weeks. In total, I replaced about 50 bulbs, and 10 - 15% of them could be troublemakers. I am still happy that we switched, and the light is much nicer, but there's more to it than just replacing and running maintenance-free."

You are just a project to her now.  She wants to reconcile her marriage. That it is with you is just a matter of coincidence. She wants to save her marriage out of shame or for her career reasons.

madhjsp,nfl,1389205392.0,"They were surprisingly disappointing this year. Aside from Roos, all had very noticeable struggles at times this year, even Levitre (although he was mostly solid).  

Turner, who we inexplicably kept over Velasco (who then went on to start and play well for Pittsburgh, just as he did last season with us), was atrocious and was cut a few weeks in as soon as Schwenke got healthy. Schwenke had his moments and seems to have potential, but he also continued to struggle with injuries later in the season and like any rookie, he had his growing pains.  

Same with Warmack. Although he started from the outset and his health was never a problem, he had some issues this year in pass protection. He was just fine in the running game though, so everyone is optimistic he'll become a more well-rounded player with experience and coaching. He had a pretty typical rookie lineman season.  

David Stewart, unfortunately, may be reaching the end of his time in Tennessee. He was never really healthy this year, and it showed in his play. He wasn't outright awful, per se, but he was nothing like his former self. We are probably looking at a RT in the first round this year.  

Overall, this was an inconsistent unit that failed to live up to preseason expectations. Part of that is due of course to health, but a fair amount of blame also must fall on OL coach Bruce Matthews, who for all his greatness as a player, just does not seem cut out for coaching. Our line play has been noticeably worse in the past few seasons after Munchak got promoted and left the job in his hands. And now it comes out that Munch's refusal to fire his old buddy was one of the main reasons he was fired as head coach. "

without the answers to those two questions, my very generalized advice, such as it is, is to have an ""exit interview"" with each of them. without sounding whiny, angry, or upset, simply ask each of them some questions.

* why did you find me attractive in the first place? what made you want to be in a relationship with me?

* what do you think are my best qualities?

* what do you think are my faults? and what can i do to improve myself?

* if you could change any one thing about our relationship, what would it have been?

don't use those answers to try to ""win them back"" but use them to really think about yourself and what you might or might not be doing in the relationship. also, if you have a close friend who is not someone you are romantically involved with, ask them the same types of questions."

Given say the United States population, everyone has their own self-interest because humans are psychologically selfish, that's how we've survived. Yet to surpass this or at least weaken that psychological aspect it's much easier to live in an egalitarian society if it's ~150 people because you can actually form a utopia by sharing experiences and goals. If you imply that this can still be done with the United States population as reference, you would need the people to run the state without any form of hierarchy to dictate. This is virtually impossible without having a ""committee"" of people to interchange leadership. Because of this very concept a hierarchy is formed thus poisoning the very concept that Karl Marx suggested. A hierarchy will turn into a totalitarian regime, thus oppression and no common welfare.

&gt;
On March 12, 2013, it was reported that Twinkies would return to store shelves in May of that year. Twinkies, along with other famed Hostess Brands, were purchased out of bankruptcy by Apollo Global Management and Metropoulos &amp; Co for $410 million. Twinkies returned to US shelves on July 15, 2013.[18]
The new Twinkies, which contrary to popular belief, were made smaller before Hostess Brands filed for bankruptcy and not afterwards, now contain 135 calories and have a mass of 38.5 grams; while the original Twinkies contained 150 calories and had a mass of 42.5 grams. The new Twinkies also have a longer shelf life of 45 days, which was also a change made before bankruptcy, compared to the 26 days of the original Twinkies.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389205633.0,"To be honest, it sounds like you're taking everything too personally.  I get where you're coming from, but she likely wasn't trying to hurt you.  If you decide to stay friends after a relationship, then you have to take on the role of ""friend,"" not ""ex-boyfriend.""  It sounds to me that she was treating you like she would a friend while you were still acting like an ex-boyfriend.  I mean, let's look at things...

*  You guys broke up, and regardless of whether or not you thought it was messy *later on*, you said it was a friendly breakup.

*  She didn't force you to watch her cat, she asked.  You could have said no, but being a good friend, you said yes, especially since she didn't have other options.  This was nothing more than a favor, she owed you nothing because of this.

* She went to Romania and then contacted you to make sure you were okay.  It seems like you took everything poorly, and you even lied to her about how you felt, but she still tried to make sure you were alright.  Just a heads up, if you're angry, sometimes people can see it even if you don't mean for them to.  It's kind of like a side effect, it just happens and can be seen in your mannerisms or even how you word what you say.

* She set her facebook status and profile picture to what she wanted it to be.  She didn't have to tell every person on her friends list (nor you), as she doesn't owe that to anyone.  It's her life, and her facebook, she can do what she wants to it.  It's not harsh, it's not being rubbed in your face, because guess what?  **It's not about you.**  It's *her* facebook, so it's about *her*.  Stop making this about you.  And you know what's crazy?  She even made sure you were okay before setting that status and that picture!!  Damn dude, maybe if you said you weren't okay, she might have even held off.

So she asked for a favor, you accepted, and then she made sure everything was cool and that you were alright.  She got into a relationship, and put it on facebook, because that's what people do.  Naturally, you decided this was absurd, defriended her, and decided you wanted nothing to do with her ever again.

Does that not seem a bit rash to you?"

&gt; Honestly calories still matter on a keto diet. It's hard to gain weight when in ketosis but you won't lose weight unless you're at a caloric deficit. If you're eating enough fat that your body never needs to tap into your fat stores for energy, you can't really expect to see any weight loss. Get a food scale, track your food and adjust your macros to the appropriate caloric target.

I suspect that I've just lost enough weight that my 'normal' diet is no longer a deficit. So now I have to cut back. I've been hungry lately though, and that's at odds with what I normally see as the strength of the keto diet - not always being hungry. 

As to vegetables. The only ones I have planned for today is maybe 4 stalks of celery with my wings.

And a cute face goes a long, long, long, long, long way.

When my current bf and I started dating, I went into the relationship knowing that he smokes weed. It came out one day that I didn't actually like the fact that he smoked and that it bothered me. He (understandably) got upset with me because I didn't say something sooner. 

After we had a conversation about WHY he smokes, I understood a little bit better why he does it. While I still don't like it, I also don't let it bother me as much and let the man smoke his weed. 

If you want to maybe salvage the relationship, I say just have a straightforward conversation with her. If she can be understanding about the situation, and you're willing to take her at her word, then go for it. If not, then cut your losses. 

Also, it sounds to me like if you do manage to progress from the weed conversation, I would have a conversation about her love language and figure out what she is comfortable with in terms of showing affection. "

Doesn't it make more sense that there are tougher baddies in one region than another?  As far as building levels for the player, it is a good thing to have low-level areas to fall back on and train rather than have everything just suddenly become tough.

what_a_cat_astrophe,photography,1389205781.0,"* Did you go to school for photography?

I graduated from a 2 year program.

* What is your business specifically? ( Portraits, Weddings, Real Estate, etc )

I do all sorts of photography from local fashion, lifestyle portraiture (weddings, families, etc.), to nightlife photography (dance club, concert..)

* How did you start your photography business?

I took interest in photography at age 14, so I had a bit of experience by the time I was a senior and senior portrait season rolled around.  A few of my classmates couldn't afford senior portraits, and I did them for cheap.  

My career in nightlife started around age 19 when I started photographing parties and Facebook started to get very popular, as did tagging one another.  Eventually, I was asked to photograph a dance event at a bar, where I met promoters on occasion and things escalated from there.

* Is the photography market as oversaturated/""dead"" as many claim it to be? ( i.e. many many posts here and elsewhere talking about people choosing to photo their own weddings or have an amateur friend do it, etc? )

In some fields, it can be.  Concert photography in particular is very sought after as a profession because it means you get all access to an event and that you have an excuse to get up close and personal with celebrities.  A lot of people will shoot those events for free as long as they get access.  If the promoter of said event doesn't care about quality much, they'll take an offer like tht.  It's incredibly sad :(

* Would you recommend it to someone interested in photography? ( I enjoy it as a hobby but would I hate it as a career? )

As much as I would love to be a full-time photographer, I work a full-time job at a community college to maintain financial stability and keep photography as my side profession.  Photography has the potential to be a very profitable business, but the competition that comes with it is unavoidable unless you play your cards right.

* My personal recommendation in regards to photography as a profession

Unless you're fully prepared for the potential to need years of patience, hard work, and possible failure, I would suggest taking up photography as a side profession and keeping a part time or full time job (preferably Mon-Fri) on the side for the slow months.  Depending on what field you get into, the clients you have may strictly schedule weekend shoots anyway and things would hardly differ.  My nightlife events always occur on Friday or Saturday, and rarely will people schedule wedding or engagements shoots on a weekday."

Ashley Young had 12 incredible games when he first game and has flickered on and off since then never really reaching those heights. Didn't rate him before the transfer, don't rate him now.

Valencia has always been Valencia. The difference is he lost all his confidence under the weight of the 7. He's a monodimensional winger who was really fucking good at that job; a stronger Navas if you will.

We had 3 of the best wingers in the league judging by their goals and assist tallies. One everyone reflexively hates and has been injured for the last two years. Probably our best winger though and imo can still cut it.  One who frankly was never good enough and never had the ego to cope with it anyway. It was a bad purchase- it happens. The last lost something and doesn't look like he'll recover it. His game won't change and he'll become useless when his physique stops giving him an edge. 

I think your point out domination is on the mark to a degree. All of our wingers could cross well and pass well so we saw some nice assist figures. The big thing that separates flair wingers from other though is that ability to do a step over and create their own space without exchanging passes. When it works, they create space all on their own without pulling another player over to support them. That's necessarily risky.  Hence moments where wingers look absolutely dominant and large periods where they look pretty neutered save for a cross coming in. "

That should be enough of a warning. ON may not be perfect but it is one of the best, and who knows wtf is in the supplement he's pushing?

I dunno how it is down there, but supplements are not closely regulated in the U.S. because they aren't categorized as traditional ""food"" products.

In high school we learned to be critical thinkers...criticism is a good way to improve ideas, so we learned to criticize our own nation as an example.  On my own I applied criticism to my faith, and realized that my justifications for being Christian were no better than a Muslim's justification for being Muslim.  I could literally use the same arguments.  And I realized that if I couldn't demonstrate my beliefs, it was a bad idea to think they were right.  And above all I wanted to know the truth.  I didn't just want to accept what I was told.

Anyway, I quickly slipped to Deism, and then through studying human history and anthropology realized that God is just such a classic human invention...and the inventions were so wild and different, it was clear that no human knew anything about any 'God', and anyone who did was lying or delusional.

It was all just stories, and the default and simplest position to me, after applying Occam's razor, is that God just isn't there, because he's not really needed to explain anything anyway.  All arguments for God break down to 'because I want it to be true', never 'it's the best explanation'."

She ""has a boyfriend"" that she talks about on Facebook, but he doesn't believe in Facebook and refers to him as ""himself"" because he doesn't want his identity on the grid (maybe he's embarrassed of you?  Or doesn't exist so you had to cover your tracks?)

She posts on Facebook about her traditional values, cooking for her brothers, and her really boring nephews that she obsesses over.  She has this obsession with things like ""real gentlemen treat women like this"" etc because I think her version of men is Disney romanticized and not based in actual fact.

She has a White Knight friend who comments on her posts a lot like a puppy dog.  She seems to ignore him because he's like a 4 or 5 in attractiveness (about where she is) but she still thinks about hockey players she played volleyball with.

&gt;Local activist Antonio Buehler is seeking damages from the Austin Police Department and several officers who he says have violated his civil right to film officers during arrests.

&gt;Buehler, a 36-year-old Army veteran and founder of the Peaceful Streets Project, has been in dispute with the department since officers arrested him New Year’s Day 2012 as he videotaped a woman getting arrested on Sixth Street. Buehler has alleged he was trying to capture the officers abusing the driver and her passenger, and he later founded Peaceful Streets, in which members record police encounters and post them online.

&gt;Local activist Antonio Buehler sues Austin police, officers over filming arrests photo

&gt;Antonio Buehler talks to his supporters and the media at the Travis County Jail on Sunday August 26, 2012, after getting ... Read More

&gt;He has been arrested several times since then for filming officers. His latest complaint, a federal lawsuit filed on the last day of 2013, comes more than four months after a Travis County grand jury in August cleared Buehler and officer Patrick Oborski of felony charges in the January 2012 incident.

&gt;In the civil complaint, Buehler alleges that Oborski, officers Robert Snider and Justin Berry and Sgt. Adam Johnson have violated his civil rights for arresting him while he has tried to videotape what he describes as police abuse. He asks for unspecified compensatory and punitive damages from the defendants, as well as attorney fees.

&gt;Buehler recounts the New Year’s Day incident in the records, saying he had been refueling his truck when he saw officers arresting a woman for driving while intoxicated. He said he was concerned about their use of force on the driver and her passenger and pulled out his cell phone camera to capture their actions, which was legal.

&gt;Oborski pushed Buehler in the chest, chuckled and accused Buehler of spitting on him, and the officers aggressively arrested him, Buehler says in the petition.

&gt;Buehler later accused Oborski of lying in the police record. He filed a complaint against the arresting officers, Oborski and Robert Snider, who were cleared by an internal affairs investigation in July.

&gt;The grand jury did indict Buehler on a charge of failure to obey a lawful order, a Class C misdemeanor punishable by up to a $500 fine. The jurors returned an indictment against the female passenger in the other car, Norma Pizana, on a charge of resisting arrest, a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail.

&gt;like this.

I have no problem with how you did it, but just in case you'd rather use the formatting that's available and you didn't know, there ya go.

As for the first part, we're on the same page.

&gt;women aren't flirty with men they aren't into.

Maybe you aren't, but this is not at ALL across the board, not even close.  Some women (and men, too) are just flirty in general.  Maybe in a bar or something, flirty is flirty (especially with people you didn't know before that night), but if it's with someone you know, sometimes people are just being themselves and nothing more.  Sometimes it's bad to react because you don't want to cause an issue (e.g. in the workplace) if you misinterpret the signals.

As an example, I was at one job and this girl seemed like she was all over me at work.  Always giving me looks, super excited to see me, smiling at me ALL THE TIME, laughing at my jokes, putting her hand on my back when she passed (and didn't need to), grabbing my arm, the works.  I mean, you'd have to be pretty blind not to notice what was going on, and even the people I worked with were asking what was up or if we were dating.  I asked her out on a date one day, and she turned me down.  It wasn't a big deal, but it was a shock!

It happens, and this isn't the only time this has happened to me or my friends.  Some people are flirty in general, some don't know their flirting, I mean, there's a lot that can be going on, but it's not that simple.  I can't speak for every other guy, but I don't usually think it's anything at work until it's really obvious.  If it's mild flirting, it could be nothing.  There was an interesting concept in the show ""The League"" which was the ""work flirt.""  Basically, they flirt with each other and as a result, get things done for each other, but it's nothing beyond that.  "

You may be better off reading about the general types of superconductors, and the ranges at which they work.

http://superconductors.org/

This website has some details and keeps a list of many publications (although you'll need to get access to the original source yourself). However, most of these aren't true superconductors in the broad sense of the word; you couldn't just cool a lump of it down, attach some wires and read a negligible resistance. There are certain properties which signify the presence of superconductivity, most of the materials on the website I linked have been shown, to some degree, to demonstrate those properties under specific conditions.

In terms of types, there's many available, but I'll list a few of the main groups and you can read more about them if you want. Apologies for the wikipedia links, but they're a decent enough starting place for basic information, and should give you the knowledge to be able to google for more accurate/reliable sources if you want.

Ceramic superconductors are the type you mentioned, many of these are very easy to make. A very important type are based on the YBaCuO material, this was important as it was a very easily produced material (often given to undergraduate chemists to make), and had a superconducting transition within the temperature range of liquid nitrogen, making it very cheap to ""use"" (in relation to materials needing cooling with helium, etc).

There's also some interesting organic based superconductors, although these are less widely used.

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1389206515.0,"&gt; What I don't get, is how things changed so dramatically in the last 50-100 years. I'm confused as to how culture and even law has been feminized so much, even though men have had the majority of control. We've still had primarily men occupying the powerful political positions, heading corporations, and owning the majority of wealth and resources. Are you telling me that men did this to themselves, willingly? Or am I missing something here.

What does a man in a leadership role truly owe to you? Why do you assume that men couldn't ""do this to themselves"". We're not part of a team. (Yes, I know that's the problem.)

Many male leaders throughout history castrated other men near them, just to build up their harem further, supposedly stem aggression and competition in their male servants. What makes you think any man near the top today wouldn't do that to you to benefit himself?

As to why you perceive society to be effeminate, it's because women as a group have a lot of power and consistency (easier to pander to as a group), both politically and economically. 

Do some research on the ""partisan gap"" in women vs men's voting for the political angle. Do some research on the consumer spending for the economic one.

It's pretty clear why you see a feminine bias in society. It doesn't matter if there are male leaders. Many leaders will just throw you under the bus if it allowed them to maintain power."

There's also the pre-selection and jealousy elements-- which is why women think them getting with some other guy will somehow make a guy they kind of sort of still want jealous and try to get them back but most of the time doesn't. Too many women think guys operate just like them in their sexual preferences and proclivities in this way. Another arena you'll see this in is the whole income thing.

* [Megg's History of Graphic Design](http://www.amazon.com/Meggs-History-Graphic-Design-Philip/dp/0470168730), absolutely essential to understanding where graphic design comes from historically. IMO the best GD history book on the market, at least the most encompassing. One of my favorites, was very helpful writing different papers and researching historical styles.

* [Graphic Design School](http://www.amazon.com/New-Graphic-Design-School-Foundation/dp/0470466510/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389205349&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=graphic+design+school). Another great book, focuses more on design process and stuff like that. This one more walks you though being a designer. Gives tutorials on different things too, which is useful.

* [Graphic Design Referenced](http://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Design-Referenced-Bryony-Gomez-Palacio/dp/1592537421/ref=pd_sim_b_14) is a really great book that is a bit of a hybrid. This book describes a lot of design terms, styles, and general knowledge while referring to historical and modern examples.

Those three for me are really essential books for new graphic designers, I learned more from those three than I can express. Below are a few more books I really like, but might be a bit more advanced than someone just getting started might want.

* Another book I have used a lot, and almost included with those three is above. [Thinking with Type](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-2nd-revised-expanded/dp/1568989695/ref=pd_sim_b_2). Really great intro into typography.

More advanced even.

More practically, a glacial shroud gives him mana and cdr for better trading with his q and armor, or you could go Randuin's for that CC and dueling power. Heck, you could even go frozen mallet--AD, health, and CC. But there's no particular reason to go with Sunfire (unless you're going MPenwick), while Warwick *does* have a particular need to buy stick, tankiness, and onhit.

I know he has memory problems though (partially from chemo and partially from...not chemo), so I'm sure we could come up with a solution that would work for us.

As far as not telling the truth, I see nothing he would gain from this as I still plan on being on birth control for my own reasons, and he knows that if I were to get pregnant when I wasn't ready, I would get an abortion.

My advice to you is to use this opportunity to be brutally honest with each other about every aspect of the relationship. You know those things you don't tell each other because you are afraid of hurting the other person's feelings? Tell each other those things. This is your chance to finally get everything out in the open on both sides and fix your marriage. Nothing should be off the table.

As far as the sex...I know this sounds counterintuitive, but sometimes it's better to just bite the bullet and do it even if you are upset with your partner. In my opinion sex helps to foster emotional intimacy and can be cathartic for both parties. And the longer you go without sexual intimacy, the harder it can be to get back to it in the future."

zaelyna,cs50,1389206912.0,"Hey all,

I'm Zae, 26, currently in Denver after two years in New Orleans (slowly making way from east-to-west coast US, then hopefully the world xD). I've been self-studying screenwriting and film production since graduating in Dec '09, cuz I don't need more debt (and cuz learning film is more valuable OTJ training, imo).

However, I love learning (for any Potter fans, I'm a Ravenclaw), and value continued education in any form. Since I lacked a proper education up through high school, and had more of a writing focus in college, I'm making up for it through UReddit, Coursera, and classes like this one. I'm familiar with computers, but not enough to navigate troubleshoots or programming without help from my BF.

When I met my BF (programmer/gamer) and he learned I'm interested in screenwriting, he asked if I ever considered writing for games. I hadn't, but now we have a mutual goal of making our own games, so I'm doubly learning film and game writing and figured gaining at least a basic understanding of game programming will be beneficial to my progress. I haven't yet told the BF about this class--hoping to surprise him by the end of the lecture series.

Likewise, in the *Odyssey*, it's gift exchange that goes on in Book 15 with Menelaus, and in Book 1 you have Athena-as-Mentes as *xenia* enjoying guest-privilege on an outright trade mission, but in that context of ""your granddad and I, we go back,"" as well as the comment in Book 19 that rosemary85 discussed. So, maybe, we have some shadowy representations of commercial culture or economic structure that had a more gift-based logic to it, where it's not just about strangers in general but preferred trading partners with whom you have and offer credit (in an honorable way), with some sense of how it's considered noble to be that guy who's first willing to risk the first transfer."

Just... crazy stuff that sounded like it was right out of a teen paranormal novel.

I thought maybe he was just suffering from some sort of PTSD because he had been in the Marines and kind of went along with it for a bit, and then he told me that when he was in the Marines he'd been stationed in Eastern Europe, met a girl there, got married, and that she turned out to be a spy and when he found out she tried to kill him. He legitimately believed this stuff, you could tell when he was talking about it. He was just straight up crazy.

I got the fuck out of there, especially when after three dates (he told me about the werewolf stuff second date, marine stuff third date) he was telling me he loved me. I tried to tell him that he'd told me some pretty crazy stuff and that I thought he should think about getting help and he just wigged out on me so I blocked him on facebook and my phone and everything else, told my friends not to talk to me about him (we had a few mutual friends) and moved on.

I'm not going to tell you how to feel about your location and it's kinda nuts that you keep insisting on this.

It's also possible to hate a certain type of cuisine. You seem to think because these categorisations are larger, you can't take issue with them. Well that's just nuts. I can dislike a cuisines but still like a particular dish or restaurant. And I can dislike a dish or a restaurant and still like the cuisine.

Now I will agree that it is poor form to write off something vast when you don't know much of it. So yes, writing off a state when you've only seen one city, or a cuisine when you've only tried one dish is kinda nuts. And it's something people do a lot of. It makes sense....people aren't exactly prone to investing more in something that's already disappointed them. Calling them out on this likely won't do anything but convince them that they were right and all X sucks. And in this case, you're making massive assumptions.

Clearly, it must be Houston's weather that they hates, and not something about the weather that is true for most of Texas. Clearly, even though they specifically mentioned hating state politics, they're just being stupid and unware of local politics. Seriously, you're just being an asshole. I get the wish to defend the place you live, but attacking someone who doesn't like the place is not the way to do it.

And no, I've sent, maybe 7 minutes total on this argument. I wouldn't normally spend that much time, but I'm sick in bed so I don't have much better to do.

Rhinowarlord,Pathfinder_RPG,1389207280.0,"&gt;A good RPG system will let you improvise with the tools that it gives you. If you have to constantly struggle with the system to accommodate player's crazy ideas or simply tell them ""no, there aren't any rules for that"" then it's a bad system.

This is exactly why I like (dis)advantage. If the player wants to try to do something, you choose the most relevant attribute (and optionally, skill) and either give them advantage or disadvantage on it depending on the situation.

Another thing I've noticed in Next is that there's fewer specific rules, so you don't have to consult a flowchart or  modifier table any time you want to try to do something, or even get told ""no rules; impossible."" Sometimes you don't need two tables of DCs and DC modifiers to tip over different objects with differing weights and amounts of legs (I don't think that's an actual thing, just an example I made up). The DM can just decide that a table is fairly easy to flip over and use for cover, while a 4 foot diameter iron brazier full of coal is hard to push over. Brevity is the soul of wit and all that.

So I don't see the change in my eating habits as a diet because diets are temporary and wanting to be healthy is not a temporary thing for me. 

The food I eat has changed because I need to lower my gluten but I still eat much of the same food only like you said with proportion control. What has helped me is tracking my calories. 

When I was on Jenny Craig it showed me proportions but I just ate the food I was given and didn't pay attention to the caloric value so in the end it was just a waste of money.

The whole point of marriage vows is that you commit to working through rough patches as a team -- yes, even infidelity. If you want to give up on the marriage whenever things get tough, then what's the point?

IMO, the only time a divorce is necessary is if one or both partners are not willing to work on the marriage. But if both people are willing to make a real effort, then the marriage can often be fixed."

I'm sure there are ways around it. I don't know how Snapchat detects a screencap; it's possible you could stop the OS from notifying Snapchat, or maybe alter the actions/buttons necessary to take a screencap so that Snapchat doesn't recognize it. Your best bet is probably to use a laptop/desktop to emulate a phone running Snapchat, then take a screencap using the desktop OS. And maybe Snapchat still doesn't delete things securely. Maybe they do ""delete"" the picture, but don't forcibly rewrite the hard drive and you can use a tool to dig through the hard drive and retrieve it.

To use your suggestion, we'd need to change the design entirely to allow off-the-shelf parts, and putting hot, noisey GPUs and CPUs with those huge stock fan coolers into narrow plastic, sealed housings is absolutely a terrible idea. It would quickly overheat them due to the  facts that plastic is a very poor conductor of heat; it would cause rattling and noise issues from fans vibrating within the enclosures; and if you're using off the shelf parts that you want to just stick inside the enclosures, well, you're not getting any of the plug and play benefit of this design, where literally anyone can do it. Plus, you still have the engineering challenges of somehow making this all work with off the shelf CPUs, GPUs, RAM sticks of different sizes and power requirements, etc.

So, what you're proposing has all the traditional challenges of building a regular PC, but removes all of the benefits (the room for air cooling, universal adaptability, parts swapping capabilities, noise reduction inside traditional cases, etc.) No, this design only works thew way Razer is pitching it because they've solved all of the engineering ans user challenges. Now, of they open up the standard for other OEMs to make pods of products for it, that would be great. But, that's not what you were calling for above.  "

slockley,AskReddit,1389207811.0,"&gt; please explain how that is not an establishment of the Christian religion

1. Defining marriage as between a man and a woman is not an exclusively Christian concept.  Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Sikhism and Hinduism explicitly or widely condemn the homosexual act.  The definition of marriage is a natural extension of these religious stances.

2. Laws that do not favor one religion over others do not constitute the establishment of a state religion.  Murder, for example is condemned in many religions, but laws regarding it do not establish any or all of them.

3. If a law doesn't favor a single religion, and if laws that do not favor a religion do not establish that religion, then laws that concern the definition of marriage cannot violate the first amendment."

If this effect is not present in all conversations, this could then easily be explained as being an expensive system, in terms of monetary cost, raw components, or data processing power."
DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,MakeupAddiction,1389208088.0,"First, I would like to thank you for showing me my slip of using the word ""real"" and giving me the benefit of the doubt that I didn't mean it as offensively as it came of. I know that ""cis"" is used, but the be honest I've only heard it spoken in a derogatory way and don't really like using it. I'm not saying it is inherently derogatory, or that it shouldn't be used. It's just that I personally don't like it. That being said, there isn't a much better way to say I what it was I was trying to say and using ""real"" was an unintentionally worse choice.

I haven't seen the movie, so I can't discuss how they portrayed the specific character. If you feel that Jared Leto played a caricature of a transgendered role than I agree with your Breakfast at Tiffany's comparison. Mickey Rooney was obviously not trying to portray the reality of an asian landlord, he was just playing a vaudevillian/racist caricature. That is a big difference. There have been many asians who have played asian stereotypes, it is a stock character and at the time and it was probably how the character was written. I personally don't believe it would have mattered who played, although Mickey Rooney's vaudeville background easily could have brought some worse aspects out than by someone else, so I understand your point. 

Again, I can't speak to your second point again, because I haven't seen the movie so I don't know how they portray him. I agree that too often the gay/trans/""loose female characters are only there just to be killed off. There are tons of essays and documentaries showing this and I agree it is a problem. 

Was the character portrayed disingenuously or disrespectfully? Then no, it doesn't need to be supported. Was the character portrayed respectfully but by a cis male? Than yes, I think it should be supported. People aren't going to go from 1-100 immediately and start making tons of movies with trans leads because they don't sell to the masses. It has to be baby steps of getting people who don't understand more comfortable and more willing to spend money on those movies. As a pragmatic stance, I think that as long as it moves the agenda forward in some manner it should be supported and not criticized just because it didn't move it forward enough. This is a point that isn't very well explained online, so I'm sure I'm opening myself up to dissenting opinion, but I hope you get my ultimate point. 

Finally, it comes down to money. It's a catch-22 that many little people come across as well. They can't get roles because people won't look outside the box and cast them, so they can't get a name for themselves, and then when there is a little person role (like The Hobbit) they cast taller people because they bring ""a name"" to the picture that an unknown little person doesn't. It sucks. It also sucks that they can only get roles that are specifically for little people. 

It also comes down to the transgendered community worldwide does not buy the movie ticket amounts that cis do. That's just a fact. As the lgbt community has realised and utilized their power of their spending habits so has businesses. That is why I say support movies with these characters. Not if they are horribly stereotyped, but as long as there is some progress you can show hollywood and let them know there is a market, but there would be an even better market if there were actual trans people casted as well. 

You know, as I write this, I think my entire argument comes down to my disagreement with you statement 
&gt; That role should have gone to a trans woman, full stop.

I personally think it is ultimately ok for all actors to play all roles. Do I think it would have been awesome to see a trans person play it? Yeah. That could have been great (if they were good at acting. Just being trans doesn't matter). I don't believe it's a ""full stop"" situation. That is my only complaint. Everything else I somewhat agree with you on. "

Dharmasabitch,funny,1389208165.0,"You're right. Historically/biologically speaking, we're not considered a species that mates for life, while there are many bird and certain mammal species that are. It's incredibly common for males to seek extra copulations to maximize their fitness (because females are reproductively inactive for 9 months, with parental-care effectively 12+ months, at a time), even when they are part of a pair-bond. This is the difference between social and sexual monogamy. We exhibit a lot of one, but less than you'd think of the other. There's also a concept of ""genetic monogamy"" - monogamous relationships with known paternity of the young - that we violate with the practice of adoption, or y'know, the wife-milkman thing.

Aside from that, and the fact that *all* humans are technically omnivorous (we have the *capability* of gaining nourishment from meat, even though we don't need it), this is hilariously accurate."

If we have GMOs in the fish ponds and that cuts down how much overfishing and destructive harvests occur at sea, then in my opinion, the opposition is just being silly.

If we have GMOs in the rice field and a given stalk is producing three times the grain and surviving 3 times more often to harvest, then quite frankly I'm excited for it. 

These benefits are undisputed.  Nobody is going to get around and say that they are an ultimate evil because there are just too many benefits to GMOs to NOT seriously consider the methodology.  The problem many people have with it though is namely ONLY one thing: Monsanto.  Monsanto was smart enough to position themselves very early on in the GMO world to essentially monopolize the process.  When people say they are against GMOs, if you ask them to elaborate it further, they aren't really caring about GMOs on the environment more so they care that Monsanto is the big name and it's a corporation.

However, some people do care about the environmental impacts and those people have some merit.  But this is why we do research: so we do limit the impact of GMOs, if any, on the environment.  Thus, it is a reason to PROMOTE GMOs, not denigrate them.

Will I eat it?  Yes.  I do it every day.  I eat animals very happily.  I eat fruit happily.  And I eat vegetables begrudgingly.  GMO food is food.  If you eat a food that comes from an organismal source, you are eating something genetically modified.  Artificial selection for genes is an example of genetic modification of a stock and we do it every day and have done so for centuries.  People saying the genes will be toxic are quite alarmist.

 Are you really going to go around and say: ""Hey, we're not going to give 400 tons of food to the hungry because it's genetically modified (even though hundreds if not thousands of investigations have proved otherwise and discredited those investigations cited by GMO opposers)?""  No, you're not.  As a manager, you're going to say: ""Here we have a safe food that can be grown cheaply, I'm going to feed these people.""

Sorry, I get on a soap box really easily and I love when people try to challenge the position.  GMOs have been deemed safe.  Science has deemed them so.  And people who want to be against GMOs need to stop believing in the very politicking they fight against: the politics of idealism over scientific fact."

I would consider it almost impossible to build a robotic welder what has the diversity and ability of a man, can it climb into the rafter beams? Enter in small spaces? Can it then diagnose an array of problems? Can it perform accurate fine motor tasks and large feats of strength? I've written codes for Fanuc welding robots, and they need to be in very special environments with absolutely no change, require repetitive tasks, no problem solving, etc. They're amazing machines capable of great things, but limited in application due to size, the fact that they don't move to the task, and that the coding is only for specific predetermined movements and actions. People are versatile, so the jobs that care for the robots and the robotic facilities like the maintenance mechanics and welders are very likely the last to go. I foresee myself jobless before many of them.

White collar jobs are where we are really going to see the next big push of automation. Programs, codes, macros, excel sheets, and technology are rapidly displacing repetitive knowledge based tasks.

I can tell you that you're very likely to find polydactyl cats along the coast of New England because sailors at the time thought that they were good luck, and whenever they made port the cats did, too. I can tell you that the main difference between deer and antelope is that one has antlers and the other has horns, and tell you the difference between the two (horns have a bone core and aren't shed, while antlers later ossify into bone, but are shed at the end of mating season). I can tell you that the largest 'small' cat is the mountain lion, and one of the reasons it's classified as a small cat is it's ability to purr, which large cats do not. I can also tell you that foxes aren't canines, but vulpine, and so if you ever hear about a fox/dog hybrid that person is *lying.*

A face steamer doesn't do anything for the face as pores can't open/close and they can also cause broken capillaries. I imagine the pore cleanser works like a pore strip which can cause enlarger pores. Your SFs fill back up anyway because they are completely normal to have.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389208770.0,"I've actually been in a similar situation - one of my exes made a date with another guy 24 hours after she broke up with me.  It hurts, sure, but she didn't owe me anything - if she was ready, it wouldn't be right for her to wait on my account.  It's not her job to consider my feelings before she could start dating again.  It's her life, she needs to live it.

I urge you to take another look at the course of action...

His watching the cat should have nothing to do with her relationship or lack thereof.  It's simply someone watching a cat.  He said it was a friendly breakup, and what I'm getting is that they were still friends or at least friendly with each other.  This was nothing more than a friend asking another for a favor.  If he expected to get back with  her through this action, he was being foolish.  If he wouldn't be willing to do this favor if she had a boyfriend, then he would be being foolish.  The wellbeing of the cat should have nothing to do with the past relationship.  It's completely irrelevant.

She then talked to OP to see that he was doing okay.  Maybe she noticed something when she dropped off the cat.  Maybe she knew she was about to change her status, and if he wasn't okay, for all we know, she could have decided against it.  If you want to see who was acting poorly in this scenario, OP lied - he was still upset, but he said he was okay.  She changed her status under the impression that he was cool with things.  I see absolutely nothing wrong with that.  She didn't just figure things were okay, she was *told* things were okay.

I don't know where you're getting guilt from...you said that friends generally care about each other, and yet, checking on him is guilt instead of caring.  Bit of bias here, no?  And then she doesn't tell him about the relationship, but really, why should she?  For one, she has no obligation, and two, then everyone would instead be saying, ""what?  she checked to see if you were okay and then said 'oh btw, I have a boyfriend' just to rub it in your face?  What a terrible person!""

And finally, if he was under the impression that they weren't compatible, then why should he care that she has a boyfriend now?"

justgivingsomeadvice,lakers,1389208832.0,"Do the Lakers still have max-level cap room if they sign Hayward/Monroe/Deng in 2015?

Kobe's already on the board for $25 mil. K-Love will probably be making $20 mil or so for his max? That means the Lakers could only have $15 mil or so in cap space left for any contracts beyond 2014. If we include Hill and other role players for maybe $6-7 million (I'm assuming Hill will get ~$3 mil and the other role players like X, Farmar, and Wes will get ~$1 mil), that leaves like $8 mil right? And the Lakers' first round pick might be pricey too if he's a really high draft pick. I don't think Hayward, Monroe, or Deng will be paid less than $10 mil so unless they want to take a paycut to come to LA (doubtful) I don't see all this happening."

RubyRhod,losangeleskings,1389208844.0,"The problem is, we're a North-South team only. We have very little East-West movement save for the defenders passing back and forth to each other. Just watch our PP and compare it to other teams. We move the puck in such an obvious manner that teams can pressure us while we're on the PP. We move the puck in a U instead of making the goalie go from side to side. It feels like 90% of Kopitar's time with the puck is spent circling around the right side dot drawing double coverage until he passed it off back to a defender.

Is this because of our weakness on the LW? Probably. Either way, it's not a winning strategy. When someone like me who only has a reasonable understanding behind hockey strategy can pick apart our team and know all of our players very limited offensive moves coming into the zone (looking at you Brownie, with the left side cut back), just imagine what a professional scout / coach can do. 

The only person on our whole team who looks confident entering the zone still controlling the puck is Doughty and he's a fucking defender. 

We need a LW who has hands and who can pass. Put him on a line with Kopi so he can actually shoot the puck and move Carter back with Richards so we can get out of his slump. "

Ethics and Technology ISBN: 9780470509500 - Goes over a lot of ethical issues we see in examinations/investigations. What do you do if you are looking for trade secrets and find evidence of another crime? What if you find out a person that is accused is not the subject? What if there are other victims? 

Digital Forensics and Investigation ISBN: 9780123742674 - My 2nd favorite book I have at my desk. Goes over a wealth of information in regards to investigations. 

Digital Forensics for Legal Professionals ISBN: 9781597496438 - Its a quick read and has a lot of good info in regards to legality of evidence and how to not get your testimony or exam thrown out of court.

File System Forensics Analysis ISBN: 9780321268174 - This by far the most important book you could ever buy. Period. It goes into the weeds on how FAT and NTFS file systems work.

Meeea,Metroid,1389209103.0,"Sorry, I feel that GoldenShadowGS didn't fully answer your question of what sequence breaking IS, but described how to do it, which is totally cool.

**Sequence breaking means to get items out of the intended order**. There are points in the game where you can see a powerup, or are teased with being able to see or get near it, but you lack the upgrade to grab it yet. 

A very simple one to explain would be an area earlier in the game. There's a very high ledge that you have to jump up to in order to get to the first major boss, Kraid (the giant green lizard dude). This ledge is there to tease you that you can almost get it, but not just yet. The intended route has you back up a bit (one room) and go down an elevator, and grab an upgrade near that area that extends your jump height significantly. However, if you do a well-timed wall-jump, you can easily reach Kraid's lair without the Hi-Jump boots.

The three main methods of sequence breaking are:

1. [Wall-jumping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw_AULavpQU): This technique allows you to jump off of any wall in the game, even if there's no nearby ledge. Samus can climb up long, vertical shafts with ease by utilizing wall jumping. This technique is not needed at all to beat the game, but is available from the start without any upgrade. It's a secret move she has that is demonstrated in-game by cute little animals, and is not particularly hard to perform.

2. [Mock-ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRzGoAdNbYs): This is a more advanced technique. It essentially is a method to roll into a Morph Ball form while keeping your running speed. Normally, if you morph, you'll lose your inertia, and the ball also travels slower than running. So being able to morph will lower your hit-box size while also allowing you to travel faster than intended while morphed, helping you slip by gates that require you to run under them with the speed-booster upgrade, but before you get that upgrade.

3. [Bomb Jumping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfmcm7hkXP4): This is actually not used very often in most conventional areas (as wall jumping is better), but can find uses in a lot of cool areas. Basically, once you lay a bomb while morphed, it will explode a few seconds later. If Samus is near the explosion, she'll be bounced off by it (to the sides, if she's next to it, and straight up if the bomb is inside her sprite). Doing this lets you lay one bomb, bounce up, lay another, and do a chain of events that helps her climb into the air with ease.

but it's english. Trust me, theres people who want to move here, but I know too many anglo immigrants that are so turned off by the language assholes, that they refuse to speak unless they have to. I get the sentiment people have about le belle français, but too many go about it in this insular, xenophobic way. the kind of people who don't bother to learn aren't the ones who are going to pick montreal back up (shes been beaten pretty badly in the last few decades) it's going to be the children here who can, without accent, speak both languages fluently, and the new influx of anglos who come here and learn french.

I remember when I lived in BC, never been here before, there was this impression of a metropolitin european province, right in our back yard. How good it feels, knowing that theres this one thing that keeps us from being called 'americans' 

thats the closest correlary I can find when a proud quebeccer talks about la belle province. Call a western canadian an american, and you'll get a similar reaction.

Sorry for the rant, but the gazette pisses me off so much, with their articles that pick the low hanging fruit of english Vs french. politicians do the same.

I work beside a lot of upper middle class people who aren't fontionaires for the first time, and I just listen to their conversations, they are all bilingual, but they refuse to speak french. the polarized atmosphere the politics of have done the oppositte of what they were supposed to do... bring a strong french culture into another quiet revolution in canada, and keep it vibrant.

But it goes both ways. There is no way a population as small as quebec is going to be able to keep up with the talent coming out of the 330million north americans coming out of the rest of the continent, and I'd argue a better approach is bienvenue! and not whats being done now.

Personally, I would just like for companies and people to start moving back so we can get the Tax revenue for more permanent road fixes, and not this plywood on the 720 bridge bullshit we have now.

As for her specifically, theres two ways to fix that. make more specialists training in quebec (expensive, and long term) and make it easier, and more welcome to learn french here. Someones first experience here is with the signs of the city, making them bilingual got me my first hundred words, most people have the same experience.

It's the same with all of these other women around your age, too.

kintu,relationships,1389209304.0,"&gt; If I kick her out of the house, she isn't going to stew on what she did and then come crawling back.

Then you have no business of wasting the rest of your life on her. The point isn't even about her crawling back or revenge. Call it a temporary separation if you want to. It is just showing her the life without you(and for you, lifewithout her). And sometimes separation gives us the clarity of the situation without mising it up with emotions.  And f she is happy without you or if she starts dating other guys, why waste more time on this relationship ? But if she really misses you, she will maybe think a little more before she fucks the next guy. 

Why do you think she had the affair ?  It was a very conscious choice unlike a drunken one night stand. She even discussed her breakup with him. Make sure she is back with you for the right reasons. Respect and love. She had neither of them for you when she went about having her affair.   Right now, her reasons seem to be fear, guilt and shame .

But I was just using it as an example of how extreme it can get to show that it happens anywhere along the spectrum as well - I wish it were as clear cut as you're presenting, but it's not always.

The problem is that there are some girls that get it and will only flirt if they're interested.  You sound like one of these girls, and trust me, we're all thankful for people like you.  But then there are others that have no idea how to flirt, and consequently, flirt accidentally (my girlfriend's best friend is one of these people).  Then there are those that flirt to get what they want, or because it gets people to like them more (attention, etc.).  And then there's that bubbly personality we've talked about (if I had a dime for every time I ran into that...).  

This is why I, and friends of mine, tend not to go after girls that seem flirty until it's fairly obvious (unless, of course, we're super interested and it's worth the risk).  There's just too much ambiguity.

ANewMachine615,AskScienceFiction,1389209791.0,"Possibly. We know from *Laws and Customs of the Eldar* that necromancers (aside from Sauron the Capital-N Necromancer) are a thing. The way most dark magic like that works is to give some sacrifice of power to the being, allowing it to interact with the world again. Whether it's a sliver of your soul or something else, like the destruction of something beautiful or powerful, this foul sorcery requires a sacrifice to give the spirit enough power to interact. 

Your first instinct is correct: with the Ring destroyed, Sauron is reduced to a shapeless, powerless consciousness. Sauron's problem post-War of the Ring was that he had no power left whatsoever with which he could interact with the world, but he could not die because Ainur are tied to the world after entering it. A grant of power from someone like a necromancer could allow him to speak again, yes. It would be a very, very bad idea though, because Sauron is likely to attempt to take as much as he can get, and not be a very pleasant conversational partner. Imagine just being a disembodied mind whose only remaining emotion is hatred... and then some foolish necromancer summons you to tea.

&gt;It is therefore a foolish and perilous thing, besides being a
wrong deed forbidden justly by the appointed Rulers of Arda, if
the Living seek to commune with the Unbodied, though the
houseless may desire it, especially the most unworthy among
them. For the Unbodied, wandering in the world, are those who
at the least have refused the door of life and remain in regret and
self-pity. Some are filled with bitterness, grievance, and envy.
Some were enslaved by the Dark Lord and do his work still,
though he himself is gone. They will not speak truth or wisdom.
To call on them is folly. To attempt to master them and to make
them servants of one own's will is wickedness. Such practices
are of Morgoth; and the necromancers are of the host of Sauron
his servant.

mmp31,politics,1389209824.0,"&gt;So you're agreeing that while pegging minimum wage to the inflation rate would not be perfect, it would be much better than having it not pegged at all, as it is now, because it would devalue workers' income much less than it does now. Excellent.

Given that minimum wage exists, I agree that having it pegged would be preferrable to not having it pegged.  I am opposed to the existence of both minimum wage and inflation.

&gt;If you have $1000 under your mattress, and the inflation rate is negative (I.e. if there is deflation), you can make money just by leaving it there. There would be no reason to invest it anywhere, because you can make a risk-free return by sitting on it. That causes no economic stimulus.

&gt;With inflation, sitting on money is risky because it will lose its value, so you are incentivized to invest it elsewhere; if you do, this is added to the GDP, and is economic stimulus. This is why inflation is super great, because my spending is your income, and incentivizing spending induces stimulative pressure on the economy. This is why the whole world uses fiat currency.

Inflation is super-great if you don't mind forcibly decreasing the incomes of poor individuals, supposedly for the greater good of the economy.  The irony is that higher prices harm the economy.  Inflation causes economic gain now at the expense of gain later.  You can't cause a net gain in wealth over time simply by creating money out of thin air.  All that accomplishes is a transfer of wealth from the bottom up.

&gt;A static minimum wage is simply an institutionalized wage cut by the rate of inflation per year. With the minimum wage pegged to inflation this would cease to be an issue, as I have said.

&gt;Zero percent inflation does, in fact, encourage hoarding - during volatile economic times when the inflation rate is so low, institutions like banks will just hold onto their money because the relative risk is so low. In fact, even if the inflation rate is slightly positive but not positive enough it will encourage hoarding. This is actually the case now, as we are stuck in what's called a liquidity trap - mountains of money are being made available to banks almost for free, but because the rate of inflation is so low they have no reason to loan money out at palatable interest rates. More inflation would be quite healthy for us.

That's not true.  There are other forces at work that are encouraging hoarding that are independent of inflation.  It's true that the Fed could overcome those forces and get the banks to loan if it targeted, say, 20% inflation, but they won't do that.  That doesn't mean that too low inflation is the cause of the hoarding.  That's nonsense.  The hoarding has been caused by an economy crippled by recession.

&gt;Rising prices isn't a problem if wages grow along with them, which is a problem we need to solve. 

The only way to solve that problem is to have the government totally control all wages in the economy.

&gt;Prices aren't rising so fast as to cause destabilization, we have a very low rate of inflation.

&gt;A steady zero inflation rate solidifies the liquidity trap we're in, as explained above. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap

Unless there is a serious breakthrough in Quantum Computation (not the 'OMG qubits!' stuff that gets re-posted here every 2 days) or in the P=NP problem, then most conventional cryptographic methods (AES, SHA-256) will remain viable for the forseeable future.

Breaking a SHA-256 hash would require a thermodynamically perfect processor to be hooked up to an energy source comparable to a small supernova.

Even then, lattice-based crypto systems such as NTRU would still be quantum-resistant.

Much of what the NSA is doing is *not* breaking encryption, but subverting it - this includes adding weak seeds to the NIST EC standard, but is more commonly stuff like just legally forcing companies/people to hand over their keys ahead of time, or, failing that, breaking in thru conventional means and copying/stealing the keys by accessing the servers physically.

Aside from the NIST issue (which no one used anyway), it doesn't appear that they're trying any weird black-mathemagic that gives them access to everything everywhere - they're simply coming in thru the front door with the keys already in hand.  The cryptography is irrelevant when that happens."

Higgs_Br0son,dogecoin,1389210194.0,"&gt; In my experience, deposit slips aren't commonly used. Simple would be using paypal, a debit card, or similar. Something I can do from my home.

Deposit slips are always used to deposit cash into a bank account, unless you get a money order from elsewhere which is just more work.  On the slip you write how much cash it is, and what account its going to, and you give it to the teller.  That's it.  You can even use the drive-through at some branches.

&gt; Driving to the bank, waiting in line, and manually depositing money, is not fast.

I've been waiting a week to get my bitcoin from coinbase.  I don't have a Visa card, so I can't do the fast transaction.  And I don't want to give them my IDs and personal shit just to wait a month for that to verify.  If anything, going to a bank and manually depositing is way more secure for your personal info.

I didn't feel much guilt at first, but a few days later it suddenly hit me how much I had hurt my boyfriend, and my heart broke for him.

Has your wife done self-destructive things that she later regrets in the past? Does she have a pattern of alternating between clinginess and emotional distance? Does she feel uncomfortable being vulnerable or emotionally dependent on someone else, but crave closeness anyway? Is she sensitive to criticism? Does she crave reassurance from you?"

acsempronio,skyrim,1389210269.0,"**IF YOU ARE USING AN ENB, MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE INSTALL AND TWEAK INSTRUCTIONS FOR THAT ENB EXPLICITLY.  ENB MODS ARE NEVER LOADED FROM WITHIN NMM OR MO AND SHOULD BE DIRECTLY COPIED TO THE SKYRIM FOLDER.  MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING THE CORRECT VERSION OF ENBSERIES FOR THE ENB YOU ARE USING.**

Wrapper versions of ENBs tend to be easier than other options.

1. If you are using NMM, uninstall all the mods, uninstall NMM, and for ease of everything re-install Skyrim.

2. Once you have a fresh Skyrim install with all DLC and updates, backup Skyrim from Steam (File -&gt; Backup/Restore...)

3. Start a game and create a character.  Or make 3 or 4.  You will then make backups of these initial saves for these characters.  In the event that you hose something and want to start fresh again, you can bypass the bullshit and just load the saved games.  Plus, these are mod-free, so they are good for seeing difference is mods for screenshot reasons.

4. Use Mod Organizer: Download the ZIP version and extract the main folder to your Skyrim folder.

5. Install BOSS and TES5Edit to the Mod Organizer Folder

7. Open Mod Organizer and add BOSS and TES5Edit to your exe plugin list.

8. Add your Nexus login info to Mod Organizer.

9. Press the globe icon to open Nexus fro Mod Organizer.  Now all mods will be sent here.

Why use MO over NMM?

* It creates separate folders for each mod and then when you run the game, it virtually loads them into the game; no changes are made to your program install folders.
* the mods never actually overwrite each other when you ""install"" them, allowing you to load them in whatever order you want.  If you like they way things look with texture pack A loaded before B, but want to see it the other way, you can, without affecting the actual mod files.
* Mod Organizer syncs with BOSS.  when add BOSS to the list of executables and run it, when BOSS is completed, your ESP files will be re-organized automatically.
* Mod Organizer allows TES5Edit to be run from within as well.
* Mod Organizer has a Nexus Mod Manager Emulator in it so when you click ""Download with Manager"" it sends the file to MO instead of NMM.
* You can create profiles to be used for different combos of mods.

10. Download (or copy to the Mod Organizer download folder) your mod archives from Nexus.  If you copied them, it helps to right click the file in the download tab and click ""Query Info.""  It willthen pull version info, name, etc. from the Nexus website.  (Nexus has a standard format used for file naming and meta-data)

11. ""Install"" all of the mods.  These will show up in the left pane as you install them.  Some mods are fro the same suite of mods, such as Skyrim HD 2K.  Because of the size of the archives, the author ships them in separate files.  If you want to use them all at once, the use the ""merge"" option, otherwise, rename the mod and make a separate entry.  For now, always say ""yes"" to the BSA unpack option.

12. selecting a mod in the left pane will activate an ESP in the ""plugin tab"" on the right pane.  these will be out of order.  Run BOSS (above the right pane window) and when it completes, the ESP files will be reordered.  Look in the BOSS page for any files that need cleaning.  Clean using TES5Edit per the instructions page (linked from within BOSS.)

13.  Once everything is installed, ordered, and loaded and run Skyrim (again, from above the right pane window.)

14. If you still have the same issues, screenshot or type the mod list and ESP list you have and post it in here via the ""edit"" option for your OP post.  Some mods have special compatibility issues and the whole of /r/skyrim can probably figure out which ones aren't working right."

So, to answer your question, the first thing I look for is if they have a comp card and the dealer swipes it.  This means at least they know enough to get comps.  Chances are this isn't their first time playing.

Then I look at how much money they have. More money usually means a better player (or at least a more confident one).  Could also signify a gambling problem.   

Then I look at their appearance: sex, age, race, jewelry, clothing.  I don't necessarily judge people based on this at this point, but it can help to put the puzzle together and shouldn't be ignored totally.

Are they listening to music and paying attention to the game?  Or listening to music and playing with their phone?

Are they reading a book?

Do they know the dealers/floor or other players at the table or at neighboring tables?

What are they drinking?  

Do they have any accessories like a backpack or a big jug of water?  Usually indicates grinder in it for the long haul.  

Do they look like they know how to handle their chips?  Shuffling, tricks, counting them out, etc.

Are they visibly nervous at any point during a hand?  

Are they talking about strategy after or during a hand?  

Do they complain when they ""would have won if they had just stayed in""?

Based on those things I figure out who my biggest threats are and really pay attention to those people.  Of course, I pay attention to everyone, but I am more cautious against the threats until I see them show down some hands.

Last summer I was sport climbing 3 days a week outside and loving it, but I always felt drawn to long multipitch. To cap my first season of climbing, I did a 500 foot, 5 pitch sport climb rated 5.10a, which was a blast. I have been building my traditional climbing gear and my objectives this season are to become comfortable leading 5.8 trad lines and to do at least two long multipitch climbs, if not many more.

Good luck with all of it, and please PLEASE dig into this specific issue next therapy session. Sex is SO MUCH FUN and it relieves stress and you get to be playful and experiment and you'll learn so much about your body and your partner's. I hate thinking such a negative experience is going to be tied to you with it because if you can get over that with therapy/your SO you're going to have a BLAST! Losing your virginity isn't going to be some earth shattering thing that changes anything about you. It's just going to be something you (hopefully) enjoy doing and feel liberated by.

Sex advice, while we're here... Be open about what you like and don't like, don't worry about how you look. Focus on what feels good and pay attention to your partner, rock your hips. COMMUNICATE, COMMUNICATE, COMMUNICATE. 

Oh, and have fun!"

So what your left with is a generation of pomus women who have no real skills aside from office work.

What can the modern 20 something american woman offer you? Can she cook? **No.** Is she a warm caring person? **No**, she is self interested and narcissistic. Is she capable of deep introspective conversation? **No,** she gets bored easily and is constantly checking her phone. Does she want to go on adventures with you?  **No** because she gets turned off by the slightest inconvenience.

You cant have a fulfilling relationship with most 20 something year old women because they don't have anything to provide. The one thing that they can provide though is their vaginas, which are just as moist and warm as they were pre-feminism.

WinterCharm,apple,1389210620.0,"All those are hollow or basic geometric shapes, and still small enough to fit in the palm of your hand - the one exception being the golf clubs made of the stuff. 

[Here's the liqiudmetal golf club](http://www.ebay.com/ctg/Liquid-Metal-Liquid-Metal-Driver-Golf-Club-/45072911) As you can see, the LM is mounted onto a graphite head, as a thin, but rigid plate that has great energy transfer to the ball. The entire golf club isn't extruded out of LM. It's too complex for that. Again, a coating is thin enough to be supercooled. 

USB flash drives are hollow and they're quite thin, and small enough to be supercooled. If you look at the cruzer titanium, it's two pieces, of even thickness, joint at a seam. Both pieces are thin enough to be supercooled. 

The sansa clip player - only the back plate was made out of liquid metal - again, a very thin piece that could be supercooled. The front face is some sort of plastic. 

The problem with doing a macbook unibody out of the stuff is being able to supercool a piece of liquid metal with significant thickness is very difficult. 

[Look at this](http://inhabitat.com/is-it-green-the-new-macbooks/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/greenapple-recycling01.jpg)

The unibody is complex, and thicker and thinner in some places, but significantly thick that supercooling it in a matter of ½ a second is VERY difficult. If not cooled evenly, you either won't get proper liquid metal, or you'll get deformations/inconsistencies in places where crystalline metals will form, instead of the amorphous metallic glass. 

It's not that we can't make liquid metals in bulk - we can. It just has to be a very simple pattern, of uniform thickness. Something like the aluminum unibody, of varying thickness and very strict tolerances, is still difficult right now. 

You see in each of these cases, there was either a joining of multiple parts, or a liquid metal coating. "

Cap can tank pretty much anything if it hits the shield- that's what the shield is for- but Tony can attack every part of cap's body at once several times, is vastly stronger, smarter, can fly at supersonic speeds, has a supercomputer to help him out in his helmet, and if everything else fails he can grab Cap's shield and rip his arm off.

""Day 1 DLC"" (which has an unfairly poor connotation) allows the developers to continue working on content between the completion of the main game and it's actual release, and is a way for developers to provide additional content either as paid or free DLC for game-buyers that can also be ready when the game releases, since the DLC release process is extremely fast compared to the proper game release process.

Even on-disc DLC (for consoles) follows a similar pattern, where certain content is on the disc but ""locked"" until a smaller DLC download is released which then ""unlocks"" the DLC on the disc. This is often done when the team has some of the larger assets (maps, textures, models, sounds, etc) completed but hasn't quite finalized the balance or full process of the DLC. They can load what they know or are pretty sure they'll use onto the disc to allow for smaller downloads to the end-user, and continue working on fine tuning and balancing and debugging the content between going gold and release day.

I gotta be honest, I've met psychologists. I lived with one for a number of years. If the people I have known are at all representative, I don't trust half of them to diagnose shit. Not that they were unintelligent per se, but they didn't *understand* any of it, they just regurgitated textbook knowledge and applied the formula you described without any sort of actual thought involved.

Did you know that the DSM-V came out in May of last year? And we went from two forms of bipolar disorder to five. Obviously, the field of psychology is not infallible and we have a limited understand of how the human mind works. In fact it's for this reason that I want to study neuroscience in a lab setting one day.

I'm not saying I don't trust psychologists or that if I saw one that I would dismiss their thoughts. But I do think you're placing too much stock in these arbitrary definitions for mental disorders and formulas designed to diagnose them. I don't think one should be dismissed as possibly having a given disorder simply because they don't immediately appear to qualify.

Breakfast_King,Borderlands,1389211007.0,"This is an accurate representation of the people who own the game on Steam, and likely a close approximation of the people who own the game on other platforms, but that is not the same thing as the playerbase.

The playerbase (the people who play the game now) are the people who beat the game. They've made multiple characters. They play the 2nd, 3rd, nth playthrough.  And, most importantly, they buy the DLC.

I think the game is absolutely balanced for people that play on normal mode, but I don't think that is a primary concern for them these days.  Almost all of the work they've done to BL2 post-launch has been geared towards people who have, at a minimum, beaten the story on normal.

use_more_lube,changemyview,1389211020.0,"You're assuming several things- 

1) that there's a fair wage because there's an equal balance of power (there isn't, and there isn't) 

2) That high profits are driven primarily by the executives and not by the workforce (can you prove that?)

3) connection of high executive salaries and high corporate profits is a correlation in some cases.

Your wife needs to figure out how she can make sure this never happens again. For me, it meant stopping the bad habit of turning to other men for emotional comfort and advice whenever I had a fight with my SO. I also completely stopped chatting with men over IM.

It also looks like he has a few of the buttons on the kaospad midi mapped to some ableton effects like beat repeat, and reverb, etc. TLDR he is mostly just adding effects and touches on tracks he has produced and is most likely just playing through ableton on his laptop, so he can control a few loops and things like that. He's using the djm (mixer) to control some of the high/mid/low frequencies between the 2 kaospads and effects that he is layering on top of the master track which is coming from the laptop.

Brightt,worldnews,1389211137.0,"You really need to calm down. You're pretending I'm some holocaust denier when I'm just someone who tries to look at things critically.

""They"" as in the media in general. Whenever the holocaust is mentioned in any form of media, it's almost always about the Judeocide, and it rarely touches the overarching topic of all the people that died. How many documentaries have been made about the gypsies, or the homosexuals that were killed? Almost none I would say. The Judeocide always gets pushed to the forefront, which is frustrating to me, because there are actually people who genuinely believe only Jews were killed in the holocaust.

And yes, I do believe there is some propaganda in holocaust history, although propaganda is the wrong word in my opinion, because it's too loaded. I don't imply there is some overarching conspiracy to neglect other holocaust victims, it's just that it naturally seems to happen all over the world, even in history books, articles, movies, documentaries, everything related to the victims that got sent to concentration camps, is always about the Jews.

But it is abandoning the ""strip away everything unique about the Bond franchise, make a generic action movie"" approach of Quantum of Solace (thank God), hence all the classic Bond porn.

Think about this: Daniel Craig was brought on in Casino Royale as a fresh, young face. But in Skyfall he acts like an old man in his scene with Q. He looks like he wants to tell Q to get off his lawn. This is the franchise recognizing that, in some ways, the Bond franchise *is* showing its age and needs some new ideas (as espoused by Q in this scene), but that the old foundation (Bond) is still strong and useful."

It's not as good as having all of the routes built right into Google Maps, which would also allow for it to calculate the best route for you, but this map is ok enough. You have to load each route individually, but you can at least see easily enough where the route goes, and where the buses are and when they will arrive at your stop (the default is to only show the major stops, but you can click the box at the bottom to show all stops). It is only browser-based and loads slowly for the longer routes, but it's ok.

And then there's [this map] straight out of 1995 (other city departments use the same map. I figure that they paid a lot of money for this map over a decade ago when this sort of thing was really new, and then thought 'well, at least we never have to pay for digital maps again'). It is terrible to use, but if you zoom to wherever it is that you want to go you can at least see all the routes that go past that place."

DonkiestOfKongs,TrueAtheism,1389211525.0,"I've been in a long-term relationship with a theist, so here's what I've learned from personal experience:

* The biggest thing to remember is that this isn't a debate about faith. You're not trying to convert her. You're not trying to win. This is about the relationship. That said, this is a very difficult problem to overcome, and one that takes lots of patience and discussion. If you've only been dating this girl for a few weeks, it might not be worth it. This is only a bridge you want to try to cross if you're certain you want this girl, and this relationship. Take into account your age, her age, age of the relationship, your stage in life (college, high school, middle-age, whatever). For me, I became an atheist about 2 years into our relationship, so it had been long enough for me to fall in love, and really want to stay.

* If you've recently come out to her, she could still be reeling from the surprise of it, so it might be best to let it go for a few days. She'll be thinking about it a lot, and she'll probably have a lot of questions eventually. Prepare non-confrontational, insightful answers for easy ones. Above all, your goal is to make it seem like your values are based solidly in reason and common sense. 

* Make it clear that you take a humanist viewpoint on morals and ethics, and that there are many, many moral and ethical issues that you would probably agree on. Make it clear that your values are perfectly normal and acceptable, and that her thinking you're evil is a little unreasonable on her part. You have a solid, moral foundation that just happens to be different from hers. If you have to have a debate about it, don't frame it as a debate about her moral values versus yours, but rather frame it as an inquiry into what morals are, what goodness is, and steer it in the direction of 'good values are good values no matter what.' A useful quote:

    &gt;""Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones."" -Marcus Aurelius

    You're basically saying ""Hey, if God exists, and he's a good guy, he probably thinks I'm a good guy too. Would God say that I, of all the people in the world, am evil?""

    It might be helpful to ask questions like 
&gt;""If you didn't believe in God, would you yourself hurt people? Can you honestly say that you would go around intentionally doing bad things? You're such a good person, I sincerely doubt that you would. That same internal sense of goodness is what I listen to.""

    That's about as confrontational as you'd ever want to be though. You're never trying to call into doubt her moral system, you're just trying to get her to understand that a god or faith isn't necessary for one. The point of this is that you're complimenting her and empowering her. You're saying ""Yes, in fact you are capable of making moral decisions, there's no reason to think you aren't.""

* You'll encounter problems when it comes to the intersection of your morality and her concept of sin. Sin says that certain things are bad, because, well, they're just bad. This is anti-thetical to a rationalist viewpoint. Using homosexuality as an example, you'll see it as: ""Why should people give a shit about homosexuality? A moment's thought is enough to see that it should be entirely accepted."" From a rationalist perspective, it's easy to see that this isn't a moral question at all, but because of the concept of sin, it's muddied. This was an issue that came up later in my relationship, and my SO had already become pretty used to my atheism. I took advantage of this and assumed a hardline stance and said ""It's irrational to say that something is bad and not have any reasons to think it is bad. If two people are doing something consensually, and not hurting anyone else, and it makes them happy, it's going to take a hell of a lot more than 'God said so' to make me think that thing is wrong.""
And now she agrees with me.

* Stay away from things like ""GOD TOLD ABRAHAM TO KILL ISAAC WHERE'S YOUR MORALS NOW #REKT."" This about finding understanding and middle ground, not winning. Over time she'll realize things like this on her own.

If it's a relationship you wish to continue, you will probably have to compromise along the way. You should also make it to clear to her that it is only fair that you expect the same. If it doesn't look like she's willing to compromise at all to make it work, then you shouldn't waste much effort, because these are symptoms of someone who wouldn't do well in a long term relationship regardless of the differences. But if she's fairly open-minded, rational, and practical it could work out. It's not automatically lost just because you have a difference of opinion."

slangwitch,relationships,1389211551.0,And yet you are on a forum telling this person what to do (with a bias towards seeking out new women who might inspire his interest). I think it better to put some consideration into the finality and consequences of your actions before just going with the flow. He can't recover his current relationship if he cheats or behaves in a way that is so obviously open to doing so and he ought to realize that before deciding to just go with thrill seeking behaviors that bring new women into his life who he has sexual interest in. Break up with her before emotionally or physically cheating. That period of growing apart when one partner is considering themselves effectively single yet has not broken up with the other is so horrible to encourage.

TheDarkHorse83,AskMen,1389211553.0,"Provided I can be alone and let my mind wander without interruption, I consider it ""me time."" But if your therapist insists... let's follow her advice.

The whole thing started off with wine. I grew up in an extended family that makes Christmas gifts for each other. Every year my mother would make jams and jellies for the whole family. I'd help her pick fruit, I started at the age of 6, when I was more just running around the field eating than I was an actual help, up into my 20s when I would go out on my own if she couldn't make it. After one summer of making jelly I realized that I couldn't give it to my family, they were already getting plenty from my mom, and I had enough to last me for years. So I sat there with 10 lbs of blueberries and decided to try my hand at wine making. It was amazing. Blueberry is still my favorite, but the samples of last year's Elderberry have me thinking that it's going to be close. A wine kit can be in bottles in about 2-3 months, but you're better off letting it bulk age for a while. Fresh fruit wine can be in bottles in 6 months, but again, bulk aging is better. All of my 2012 wines spent about 9 months in secondary fermentation containers before they found themselves in bottles, mainly because I needed the containers and I didn't want to go through ""Oh no, I need to bottle X so I can put Y in a container!"" So I typically bottle in early spring, right after I plant tomatoes. From there I realized that I had much of the stuff to age/bottle beer, and I'd need a kettle and a few other things for brewing, so I figured that I'd go for it. 

Since that time the family stopped doing gifts. With the grandkids getting involved it went from four families, plus grand parents, so five, out to twelve gift baskets. To someone who literally had a dozen cases of wine just before Thanksgiving, that's no big deal, but to some it is. Now it's just for me to enjoy. Well that and I will now supply alcohol for all family functions. My favorite part (other than the drinking) is picking fruit. There's something wonderful about going into a field (even if it's a pick-your-own farm) and picking fruit, taking it home, and fermenting it into something delicious.

I'm not actually allowed to sell the wine, I don't have licensing to do so. In the US I'm only allowed to make it for personal consumption, but I'm allowed to make 200 gallons a year (because I'm in a two adult house, 100 for a one adult house). My consumption levels aren't there, neither are my production levels, but I do intend on aging some of my ""reds"" for a couple of years to see how they hold up.

This time of year the best place to start is with a kit or wine made from dried elderberries. They are both easy to get ahold of through any of the major home brewing shops, and it will give you experience for dealing with real fruit. The first thing you have to learn is that sanitation is the most important part of alcohol production, the last thing you want is an infection to screw up your hard work."

As far as your next step, I'd also recommend Duna.  It's quite easy to land on since it has an atmosphere, and it's quite easy to return from because of it's low gravity and thin atmosphere.  You can also play around with rovers and bases on Kerbin and its moons.  Setting up space stations and refueling depot (around Minmus is my preferred) can be *very* helpful for high-expense trips.  You'll want to practice docking A LOT before getting serious about those though.

As far as setting up interplanetary encounters, I wouldn't really consider it intuitive at all haha.  Head over to /r/KerbalAcademy for a ton of resources and discussion and physics help.  They have a plethora of helpful links in the sidebar, such as [This transfer calculator](http://ksp.olex.biz/)!  You can also find a lot of delta-v maps and charts, which look very nice hanging on the wall of your command center ;)

And of course there are an insane variety of mods that add a lot to the game.  My current favorite is [Kethane](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/23979-Kethane-Pack-0-8-1-Performance-fixes-tech-tree-integration-and-new-APIs), which introduces a resource industry that can result in reusable and self-sustaining extraplanetary bases, rovers, and ships.

Is the state going to foot the bill for life long care and treatment if this baby makes it to term and ends up with severe health problems or disabilities as a result of the oxygen deprivation that left mom brain dead?

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389211802.0,"I think the problem is that you (and you're not the only one guilty of this) are focusing more on how OP feels now then how the whole situation went down.  Remember what he said:

&gt; It was a friendly breakup, we agreed that we weren't compatible and that it wasn't going anywhere.

Okay, so you have two close friends, family thinks you should be together, you realize that maybe there's potential, so you try it out.  Unfortunately, you realize that you're better as friends, which is cool, it happens, so you go back to being friends.  It's a mutually agreed upon breakup, there's no malice, you both realize that it's not going to work, so you end it before you hate each other.

So would it matter if she had a boyfriend?  Well, if OP was being truthful with her, then maybe she would have thought so, but it sounds like he lied and covered up his feelings to make things go smoother.  He said in another comment that he wasn't okay, but he told her he was anyway.  Therefore, IMO, she acted how any normal person would have acted in a mutually agreed upon friendly breakup.

BetterMeThanYou,webdev,1389211812.0,"In the past I'd set up a retainer that amounted to 15-20% of the cost of the project on an annual basis.  The retainer represented a reduced rate because i used less expensive resources to handle maintenance.

I billed quarterly and did not roll over hours from quarter to quarter but in the rare occasion where someone was out of hours I cut them some slack.  Never actually had to ask for more money because the one time a customer went way over it was on a bug that  should have been caught with tests.

agree to support hours (9-5pm?), any work outside of that billed against the retainer at double the hourly rate. I chose to dole out  all additional money to the resource who was forced to work nights or weekends.  This makes for a happy dev.  Devs are gold, treat them as such.

It's also key to keep in mind what is in scope of a maintenance contract and what is considered feature development.  If you have tiered pricing for resources this needs to be clear to the customer before you begin work and bill against the retainer.

Overall, maintenance should be a profit center and a source of reliable income.  If it's too much of a burden you could stand to improve your cost and management structures.

I billed $225 for my top engineers, $180 for mid level resources and designers, and $140 for support hours. "

The truth worth knowing is hidden, and there are as many paths to it as there are seekers for it.

The path may or may not necessarily involve extravagant rituals and ceremonies, it may or may not involve the study of various deities, it may or may not involve souls and incense and diagrams and sex and energy and ""demons"" and dusty tombs and Hebrew letters and ""non-dualism"" and ""logic"" and ""science"" and celestial bodies and seemingly disparate lineages of human ideas.

People dealing with it in real time know what the kid is like and if he is a repeat offender, a liar and a trouble maker etc.  

People are given a break after the first or second incident typically, not when it is an everyday occurrence.  I'm just saying that I don't think this study is objective enough in how it looks at the phenomenon of a higher rate of black discipline.  

&gt;Also, you're pretty much being textbook racist.  

Not really at all, it is too easy to stoop to saying that unfortunately when people stop thinking critically.  Simply pointing out that at my school the black kids were the trouble makers more often than not.  Sure white kids did stupid shit too and got into trouble but the vast majority of the fights, bullying and drugs were coming from the black kids.  They were treated more harshly by the admin than a white kid who didn't get into trouble as often.  To me that is just pure numbers, who fucks around more often gets treated harsher.  I don't care if it is Asians or White kids, if they break the rules they deserve the punishment.  

Being text book racist would be saying that they deserve it simply because they are black and that black people are too stupid to behave or something dumb like that.  However they were also plenty of black kids at my school who were great kids, they were in honors classes, played sports and had no problems whatsoever.  

Stop trying to pin something as racist when I was simply trying to say in my experience at my school the reason the black kids were expelled more often than the whites was because we had a culture of ignoring authority and negativity with a lot of our black kids.  How is that the admins fault?  How is that racist?"

1. No money to actually put me in Chinese school

2. No time to get me to/deal with Chinese school

3. My mom wanted me to be more ""American"" as she saw that as a way of making it here

Creating the food is not the issue, the issue is the cost. 

With water, this is also already an issue. In countries where the water supply has been privatized and people are poor, those who cannot afford to pay for clean water are forced to go without, and drink non-potable water. Yes, de-salinization *could* provide water to these people, and indeed clean water is already there, piped to them, but they cannot pay for it, so they go without.

ariven,AskReddit,1389212118.0,"The main legalistic difference as I understand it is if you get money for head hunting.. i.e. signing up new people it tends to be on the pyramid scheme side, and if you get money for product sales/purchases it tends to be on the mlm side.

For example, years and years ago when I was in Amway for a year they made us sign a confirmation each month stating that a certain percentage of our product purchases were in fact intended for and used for sales to customers.. we were also told multiple times that you didn't need to purchase product to join, nor did you need to buy lots of product for yourself to get promoted.

How they behaved was a touch different though, my upline focused on ""buy for yourself and teach others to do the same"" where you would commit yourself to buying a product from amway if amway sold it.. they figured toilet paper, soap, etc (they have a lot of products) would work out to about 200 a month on the average.. and if you followed the steps and did that you would be ""direct"" soon enough and making lots of money.

They didn't explain that the books, tapes and functions they kept pressuring you to get were actually a sideline that the distributor organization did on its own separate from amway and were actually the big money maker for direct and higher levels in the organization.

Needless to say though, the ""no reward for headhunting"" thing seems to be one of the trigger points that will get various attorney generals looking at your company with a very powerful microscope."

Furthermore, if you post a picture of yourself on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/DTYLOOKS), they will even tell you the appropriate color that will match you best which prevents you from buying something that doesn't blend well.

The victim may take up to 20 minutes to die, suffering severe burns in the process.

&gt; In 1986 Winnie Mandela, then-wife of the imprisoned Nelson Mandela, stated ""With our boxes of matches and our necklaces we shall liberate this country"" which was widely seen as an implicit endorsement of necklacing, which at the time caused the ANC to distance itself from her, although she later took on a number of official positions within the party.

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,MakeupAddiction,1389212439.0,"The movie business is first and foremost a business. It is an industry filled with artists who truly wish to create art, but at the end of the day no one gets paid if no one buys tickets to see the movies. The writers and directors may have wanted to make this movie in order to bring attention to an era of discrimination, but ultimately the people who are spending millions of dollars are making an investment and expect to get returns. That is more likely to happen with a ""name"" actor (who is a cis male, let's be honest) than a trans unknown. That isn't validation, it is reality. 

That is my point, this movie was not going to be made. The script has been around for 13 years. At one point Brad Pitt was looking to star in it. But it kept getting pushed out because it's a gamble.  Even with this movie they lost financing 8 weeks before starting to shoot. According to the producer

&gt; He had started losing weight when we lost financing eight weeks before we started shooting,"" says Brenner. ""It was a huge problem. We had no money. Everyone passed. Matthew had lost 35 pounds. I had to be transparent, I was freaking out. I had to figure it out and get it together, it's happening, he's showing up.""

According to Matthew Mcconaughey:

&gt; AwardsLine: What kind of feedback did you get from financiers as to why they didn’t want to come onboard?
&gt; McConaughey: (Laughs.) Well, Hollywood’s not quick to really expound on the “why not?” Usually the message that gets to me is, it’s not for them. Period piece, AIDS drama? That one line hurt. I’m sure there were many desks where that one-liner was all they read. But there was a lot of talent that had been attracted to this thing for a while. You know, the stars aligned, and we willed it through. We just had to get this to a price, get financing any way we could get it, which was under $5 million.

So yes, the fact that this movie even happened is a huge deal and should be taken into account in this discussion. The fact that a movie about AIDS with a major supporting character being trans* is huge. I again can't say how well they treated that character because I haven't seen it. But having this movie do well will absolutely open doors for more roles and hopefully more understanding for the trans* community and should not be shot down because they *had* to choose a known cis actor in order for it to be made.

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1389212461.0,"I honestly think this is something you should let go. You said it yourself that you wouldn't have gone anyways. He knew that about you. When you brought this up, he did offer for you to go along. He probably figured if you weren't going to be interested in going it wouldn't be fun having you around. Not in a mean way, but that he'd want you to enjoy your time there just as much. 

Unless this is something that happens often, this was probably just him having a brain fart or not understanding the importance of this to you. You two are opposites, so he's not going to be thinking the same way as you. When he decides that he's going to plan the trip without you because he doesn't think you'd want to go, it's not him ""taking your choice away."" It's probably just him knowing you wouldn't want to go and planning accordingly. 

He apologized and admitted he messed up. If you don't want this to burden the relationship further have one last discussion on your expectations and let this go. You're putting too much emphasis on the meaning behind his decision. I doubt he was sitting there thinking, ""I'm not inviting OP because I don't want to give her a choice and because she's not important to me."" 

What do you want from him? I don't think there is anything else he can do. He apologized and he's offered to change his plans to accommodate you. If you want him to think about you in the future, just say that. Don't be mad, it'll just cause him to get defensive or not listen to what you're saying as well. Like I said, I doubt he was doing this to spite you. Make him aware of your expectations in a calm way, and trust in the future he'll remember them. If it gets to the point where it's clear he knows what he's doing and doesn't care then you can start to get more concerned. 

At this point though being angry at him isn't going to change anything. It's not going to help your relationship at all, and it's only going to prolong this issue (and potentially cause more). "

Therefore when they did something again they were treated harsher than they previously had been on an **individual level**.

I agree with your opinion that people don't automatically need to do everything together when in a couple (though when the OP talks about wanting to explore dangerous areas etc I find it odd that you specify girls wanting to look at jewellery and such). My point was simply that the way she has framed this trip (that she specifically does not want him to go) makes him feel hurt. Just as I would if my SO suggested that to me.

screenmagnet,relationships,1389212677.0,"What especially pisses me off is everyone saying that making an effort to stay in the marriage for the sake of your children hurts them more than getting a divorce. That is such a bullshit excuse that people use to justify leaving a marriage for their own selfish reasons.

Do you owe it to your kids to stay in an unhappy and unhealthy marriage? No. But you absolutely do owe it to them to make an honest effort to do everything you can to fix the marriage. If your partner refuses to join you in the effort, or if you try to make it work and after a year the relationship is still unhealthy, THEN you are justified in putting your kids through a divorce.

Yes, it is true that kids pick up on their parents' misery, and that growing up in a house with fighting and resentment is harmful. But the best solution to that is not divorce. The best solution is to be an adult, maintain a peaceful and respectful home environment even if there are problems in the marriage, attend individual and couples' counselling, and make a genuine effort to gradually repair the marriage. If the parents are too selfish and immature to refrain from fighting in front of the kids or involving their kids in their marital problems, then yeah, the kids may be better off if they divorce. But the parents are still being self-centered assholes for putting their own happiness ahead of their children.

Both my parents and my boyfriends' parents stayed together for the kids. We are both grateful that they cared enough to tough it out for us."

&gt;Is it common for her to listen to your conversations from across the room?

Well, to be fair it wasn't exactly a private conversation, but whenever it's about something we both care about and/or I'm saying something that contradicts her ideals, usually she gets in the conversation.

&gt;Is she that sexually forward with everyone she meets?

This one is a little tricky. She is not sexually active; she says it and a few friends have been observing her behaviour patterns and we concluded she says the truth. But yes, it's normal for her to say that kind of things, although only with her friends, she never does with a stranger or a classmate she's not really close with.

&gt;Does she show similar 'interest' in other men?

Not in men, but in some girls (she's bi). Actually, now that I think so, I'm the only guy with whom she hangs out in a regular basis; she talks to a few others some times, but her closest people are only girls and I.

&gt;How many other fellows has she shot down since you've known her?

As far as I know, no one else has shown such interest in her since we met. I might be wrong, but she doesn't really spend much time socialising. Anyway, no one I know of.

&gt;Be clear that you want to be more than her friend, but don't be a pushy asshole about it.

This one is a bit difficult for me, I tend to mess up, that's why I've kept distance. But I'm working on it, I really want to get better on that. I'll keep it on mind.

&gt;A date =/= a relationship. Things don't have to be that serious, it may not go anywhere and frankly it'd be better to test the waters and get it over with.

I hadn't really thought about it. You're right, maybe I should put it that way.

&gt;Maybe she wants to travel after, and actually means that shit, but if you can be the right guy, then things will go their natural way.

You got it, I don't know why I never considered that. Our major offers the possibility of international travel and she's very interested in it (we all are), so probably that's a big point.

&gt;But learning to throw yourself out their, because women aren't going to do it, and learning how to accept rejection and carry on with your head held high, that's just part of being a man.

You're totally right. This is my goal from a few years and I've forgotten about it, but I really want to do that.

compto35,woahdude,1389212821.0,"&gt; I feel like HDR makes things look too real sometimes.

Well, it's actually kind of 'hyper real' because you're looking at a rendering of a scene that the human eye can't actually take in at the same time were it to actually observe the scene. 

It's the same concept as most of the photos NASA puts out. The human eye could never see the [pillars of creation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Eagle_nebula_pillars.jpg) unassisted (obviously looking past the fact that it's 6000 lightyears away)—[that image is created by capturing tons of images using various filters for parts of the electromagnetic spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Creation#Hubble.27s_photo), then merging them together. 

&gt; I don't know how it works

Here goes…

HDR is created by taking the same photo several times at several different exposures (levels of light…in photography it's a technique called metering). At the most basic level, it's done with three meters: dark, middle, and light. 

After you take the photos, you use software to merge them together to create the final image. The dark photo's shadow areas are used for the shadows, middle for mid tones (grays and such), and the light is for the highlights. "

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389212855.0,"Well, from what I read earlier, it seems like some people are just hoping that they can avoid the rejection and have girls flocking to them instead.  They're sick of doing the work (if they ever did in the first place), and want someone else to do it for them.  Just for the record, this is not what I'm advocating at all.

And I do understand that it's usually safe to assume that a girl that's flirting is into you.  I guess my whole point for being hesitant at first is just that when it's light flirting or even sometimes a *little* more than that, we may not react because we aren't sure what signals we're getting.  At least for me, if I notice it (I unintentionally ignore it until it's somewhat strong), I will usually reciprocate, and if she reacts well, that's when I ask her out.  

But in the end, rejection is inevitable from either side.  I don't think it's realistic to really even have signals from either party that there's no potential for rejection.  It's just something you have to accept when pursuing someone, so I don't think there are necessarily signals that you won't be rejected.  But usually things that say that *I'm* interested are if I flirt (obviously), if I talk about getting together outside of work, if I joke around more with you, stuff like that, the usual.  There's really nothing blatantly obvious unless I'm trying super hard to spend time with you.

Xeonith,AirForce,1389212858.0,"I started out in Remote Sensing at Wright-Patterson AFB doing, to be honest, very boring work.

I also did a 6 month stint as Base Honor Guard working about 80-90 hours a week rendering honors at military funerals and other ceremonial events (it was probably the most personally rewarding time of my career. Don't let others knock on it).

Afterwards, I ended up at Detachment 421 in Australia doing Subsurface Maintenance in the middle of the Outback. This is considered to be one of the most desirable duty stations in the entire military because it's a 5-man detachment, you wear civilian clothes (Australian government rules), the work isn't boring (most of the time), and Australia is one of the greatest countries in the world. However, to be stationed there you pretty much have to win the lottery because as soon as a slot opens up every 9S100 and their mother applies for the position.

In the end it was a very rewarding career for me and I have made plenty of friends, both in the US and Australia. It's also an extremely small career field because of the security clearance and cognitive intelligence requirements (it has the highest ASVAB requirements of any enlisted career field). There are never more than 400-500 at a time.

Tali has been told dodgy stories her whole life by her Quarian peers about how the Geth are total dicks, she spends all of Mass 1 fighting the Geth, her father is killed by the Geth (his own fault however), she probably blames the Geth for the fact that she doesn't have a homeworld and has to live in an environmental suit and then in Mass 2 she, and the rest of the galaxy, find out that the Geth are, in fact, much more cognizant than originally thought and are not all trying to bring about the apocalypse. Obviously this is harder for her to come to terms with than Shepard or the rest of the crew due to her upbringing but through Mass 3 the conflict ends due to Legion's revelations.

At this point, he is in debt to you for all you've done and needs to pay that off. 

I'm also guessing that if you two get out on your own this pattern will be set in stone and he'll continue to assume that you should do all the cleaning in your house and come up with stupid reasons for why that should be so (such as, ""well I have to commute for ten more minutes than you do because you wanted to buy this house so badly so you should do everything and then its fair."" Or, ""I am just not as good at that as you are so you should clean everything all the time and I will take care of getting the car's oil changed twice a year- that's totes fair babes!"").

[source](http://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/merchants-pci-basics-quick-guide.php)

More in-depth (slightly non-ELI5) answer: Every merchant, in order to accept credit cards, has to be PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliant.  Every merchant will fit into one category or another based on a few key criteria: number of transactions annually across the board, as well as specific criteria per each card brand (Visa, Mastercard, etc).  If you end up a lower level (from 1-5), you must adhere to more rigorous PCI standards than a higher level merchant (more security controls on card data such as requiring the security code).

dunnoyabassa,relationship_advice,1389213408.0,"i do not know you or your boyfriend, so naturally it could be very misguided to tell you what to do.  however, here is a general life tip i would give to ANYONE:

do not commit to a relationship (romantic or mere friendship) under the hope for some eventual change and improvement.

now, bear in mind this does not mean you should immediately dump your boyfriend, but the fact of the matter is you have observed some characteristics that you foresee presenting some serious problems in the future.  do not expect these things to change.  do not expect your boyfriend to grow up and mature.  do not expect that with a little more time he'll become the person you want him to be.

you know what's up with your boyfriend.  you cannot choose his behavior for him.  you can either take him as he is, or decide not to.

when you hold out hope for your boyfriend's eventual transformation you're gambling.  you look at your relationship by taking one hypothetical future scenario and betting your time and energy on it.  you put years of resources into the CHANCE that eventually he'll put more into the relationship, commit more seriously, and try a lot harder.

the hypothetical scenarios you AREN'T betting on are the ones that seem significantly more likely given his current behavior:

-he won't try any harder.

-he won't propose.

if you're comfortable with those things being true, by all means stay with this guy.  it sounds like you care about him, and there is nothing necessarily inherently wrong with putting a lot into your relationship and staying unmarried.

if you're not comfortable with the imbalance of effort and the lack of potential for marriage, you may want to consider finding someone else."

GayLubeOil,TheRedPill,1389213422.0,"Not All Women are Like that is the Battle Cry of the Blue Pill male. Here you are sitting in a hotel lobby and reality is repeatedly cock slapping you across the face. But rather than accept women as inherently[ hypergamistic,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergamy) rather than learning anything from the expiriance you've decided to be willfully ignorant as reality rubs its soft velvety balls on your forehead.

These Basketball hoes are predominantly black, low income women and obviously represent a minority of the population. You're probably thinking, oh they're just ratchet hoes starved for cash, upper class White and Asian women would never whore themselves out for cash. Well have a seat my friend, and prepare yourself for more reality dicking.

Lawyering is hard time consuming work. It sort of pays well but only when you work sixty hour weeks. Anyway those 12 hour days start to wear on you. You have money pouring into your bank account, you drive a nice car but you dont realy have time to spend your money. Your either at your house sleeping or in the office grinding away. So what do financial secure women do when a very wealthy client walks into the door? They try to snag that fucker. He is their ticket out of the legal hell hole. Women don't last as long in the legal profession as men and this is one of the reasons. 

Well those women were in a desperate situation so their actions are excusable, you say as more and more truth dicks start rhythmic beating on your forehead. Let me tell you another story. Out of college, my friend got a job at Hollister as a manager. The girls that work at Hollister are predominantly upper middle class girls who don't realy need the money, because daddy would give it to them if they asked. They only work there so they can have more discretionary spending. Anyway my friend the manager basically got swarmed by 18 yea old associates touching his arms and chest complimenting him, inviting him to their high-school/college parties. The problem is that he couldn't fuck any of them while he had authority over them. Anyway as soon as he got a better job and no longer was confined by store policy, he fucked 6 of his former associates in three weeks.

The moral of my stories and yours is that all women no matter their class are attracted to authority and money. Hypergamy is real and its time that you take a hard look at reality, get a damp towel and wipe the truth semen off of your face."

Counter questions. Would hitler have turned out the same if his art was more accepted and profitable? What if WWI didn't happen, Hitler never served in it, and Germany wasn't hit with all kinds of financial problems as a result of reparations? What if there wasn't a larger culture of anti semitism going on in Europe at the time? (let's face it, there was, and in the states too). Circumstances really do matter, and I'd argue Hitler's actions were at least partially due to a complex tapistry of circumstances in which he found himself. DOn't even discount one's own biology. Biological processes such as hormones or how the brain was shaped could've influenced his behavior as well.

I suspect Sony has some careful decision making to do, and that there's a reason they didn't rush this for launch.

Expect a carefully curated library at first, of well known titles that fall into the ""adventure"" category - Uncharted, Assassins Creed, maybe even Skyrim - because if we're honest those games don't really have much difficulty. If we're super honest, AAA games in general are piss easy as of the last generation, and the input lag won't really matter.  QTEs might hilariously come back to bite these games in the ass though. 

They'll probably play down multiplayer for a while. The part that bothers me about this article is the line where it mentions the servers being down the hall.

&gt; So, because Israel is acting horribly we should all erase WWII memorials in Germany?

You were kind of attacking me. So, yes, naturally I act defensive.

Anyway, to the point..

&gt; For example, the word ""Judeocide"". I rarely see this word used by the general media in relation to what happened in WWII Europe.

We actively used the word Judeocide in our history lessons (and it was in most of our books as well) in order to distinguish between the overarching holocaust and the killing of the Jews in general. I have never met someone who would make a negative connection to the word Judeocide and it's pretty normal to use it where I'm from. There is nothing implied with me using the word. I just used it to distinguish holocaust from judeocide, you know, the way the words were meant to be used...

&gt; By choosing that specific word you're practicing what you accuse the general media is doing. To whitewash the other groups killed by the Nazis.

If you read my posts closely, you'll see I very selectively used to word to point towards the killing of the jews only, and I used the holocaust when I talk about the full scale murder machine.

Absolutely not (in that I wouldn't mind seeing more content). I think r/TF2 could be about anything TF2 related once it's not inane or stupid. Places like /r/magicTCG and /r/pokemon have the same structure so to speak with other sister subreddits going more indepth about certain things, there's no reason from the way I see it that TF2 should be any different.

&gt;Are people intimidated/frustrated by the weapon ban lists used in competitive leagues?

I'm not a competitive player so my point hold no water, but no, not really.

&gt;Do feel like competitive TF2 should try and adopt a pick/ban system similar to DOTA?

It can be a fun idea for a new format, but I don't think that changing the current staples to that would be wise.

&gt; If you dislike the 6v6 format could you describe why?

I don't hate the 6v6 format, but given that the classes I usually play generally aren't Demo, Soldier and Scout, then my interest in it is less than say Highlander.

&gt; are there other formats you'd be more interested in?

I'd like to see 12v12 as a competitive option in some form given 24 players is the standard for pubs.

&gt; If you have no intention of ever playing TF2 in an organized competitive setting, do you like watching it? Do you want to hear about it?

Yes, and yes!

&gt; How do you feel about TF2 being integrated into MLG?

Err...I don't know.

Yes. :'("

Similar in the case of drug using and introversion.

In the case of sex, however, people's views on it differ significantly. There are those that view as a simple physical act that's fun and feels good with no deeper meaning, and those that view it as something very special, only done with your spouse. 

In my case, I'm somewhere on the spectrum closer to the ""deeper meaning side"", and as such have a low partner count (despite opportunities to increase it). If I reject someone for their promiscuous past, even if now they've changed and decided to be monogamous with me, I'd still (probably) reject them. Simply because they either a) have not changed, so our views are still incompatible or b) their high partner-count is a total turn-off. I would feel like just a number and not very important, since I'm just another in a long line of past suitors. In a way, I've ""saved"" myself for this person, because I value the act, and they have not."

While the US technically has the ""best"" healthcare, that doesn't matter at all if large portions of the population have no access to it. It only matters for the small percentage that can afford it.

TheWhiteBuffalo,AskMen,1389214200.0,"My best friend is a guy, and it's a bromance if I've ever known one.

If I may, (and I can since I can post this) I'd like to share how we met, since it helps for context.

Back when we met in 2010, both of our girlfriends at the time went to the same church. That church was having an overnight sleepover event thing. If you didn't guess, both of the girls brought us to that event.

So the sermon and stuff is going on, the girls are singing, and me and him are just kinda standing there. (I'm not religious and neither is he, but we didn't know that yet. He actually assumed I was also religious)

So the sermon ends, and the girls kinda do their thing and chat up the rest of their church friends. Patrick, that's his name, and I and still kinda standing there, ahving a bit of small talk. After all, our girlfriends are best friends, we have to talk it up a bit and get to know each other. At some point, one of us brings up video games and Starcraft gets brought up.

**please reimagine the scene from Step Brothers ""Did we just become best friends!?**

Since then we've been great pals. We are both no longer dating the girls from then, and to this day I'm quite convinced Patrick is the best thing to come from my relationship with my ex girlfriend. (which is saying something since I lost my virginity to that same girl)

He's in the military now, and stationed in another state, so he likes to call every few days to talk. He's a party guy and sociable and likes to share stories. I'm not a party guy 95% of the time, but I at least like sharing stories and stuff too. We play video games together and what not. He's also probably the only guy I'd be willing to share a MMF with, but that would still take some alcohol/weed on my part.

He's my homie and best friend, very few things aren't shared between us.

**TL;DR**  Starcraft helped create one of the best bromances of all time."

So I tend to hook up with guys on the internet for dates or other things, which actually seems to be the norm. Cruising used to be secretive thing done out doors, now its all on cyber space and despite being an adult, I know my mother would probably have a heart attack if she found out. MY father... eh, I know his reaction would be ""As long as it's not illegal you're fine."" 

But yeah, another thing I don't admit to them is I also prefer older men. I didn't even let my parents know about my [now] ex until 2 months into the relationship because I was worried what their reaction was going to be because I was 19 at the time, he was 30.

Ching_chong_parsnip,sweden,1389214285.0,"&gt;En fällande dom kräver att du själv erkänner brottet

Nej.

&gt;Du har inte pissat positivt för THC (även om du hade pissat positivt så skulle det dock inte bevisa brottet du är anklagad för - dock öka misstanken)

Som du skriver, urinprov (eller egentligen blodprov) har inget med saken att göra, eftersom det uppenbarligen gäller köp/innehav av narkotika.

&gt;En SMS-konversation innebär inte att du faktiskt har köpt x gram cannabis

Beror helt på vad som står i SMS:en. Tillsammans med vittnesmål kan det mycket väl leda till en fällande dom.

&gt;Även om vittnet pekar ut dig i rättegångssalen, är detta inte bevis nog då ord står mot ord.

Se ovan. Dessutom beror det på tillförlitligheten av respektive berättelse. En version som ändrar sig mellan/under förhör hos polis och/eller huvudförhandling är självklart mindre trovärdig än en som är oförändrad.

Our run game may be a little weaker without Miller, but I think we can still pound the rock effectively if we need to.

Personally, I think if the 49ers have a bad game running the ball, it will be more because they're playing the #2 run defense in the league and less about injuries to any particular player.  I'm expecting a defensive battle, but hopefully the return of Crabtree will let us get enough going offensively to score double-digit points this time around."

If it's an issue, make sure he's aware that ""Daddy"" is just an authoritative but comforting word, not anything actually having to do with anyone's father.

Make sure you have a safe word, and don't be afraid to be vocal especially at first with letting him know when the pain is too much. 

Give him confidence even if he has to pull back a bit, since he may worry about guilt if he feels he's caused you too much discomfort.

Finally, always be safe with the bondage and look up tutorials on any specific ties that interest you. Not only will that ensure you two are safe, but it will also give him an idea of what specifically you're interested in without you having to explain at length.

I've had to tell my ex that just because I watch porn or masturbate, it doesn't mean I care any less about her. NOTHING would willingly make me stop masturbating.

If you can't help her see that you aren't replacing her, then it's only going to get worse and you will probably want to end the relationship.

Even if she was willing to get you off any way you wanted, you'll still want to masturbate. Sometimes you just wont want to worry about all the setup and effort."

Threads with 400 comments became threads with 4000 comments. 2000 karma posts became 10000 karma posts. There were comments made where the user indicated they were in high school.

This isn't an issue of him just doing whatever he wants, but thinking differently than his girlfriend on these issues. 

Besides, he never said she had no choice. That's the meaning *she got*. She put that meaning behind his words, not him. He should have asked her because she's his girlfriend, but telling him that he was just making the decisions for her isn't going to be how he sees this. ""He was making decisions for me"" is a warped viewed of the situation. That implies he didn't care about her feelings at all and wouldn't change his decision if she talked to him. Clearly neither of those statements are true from what she's written. If I was him I really would be pissed at that analogy. It shows that she's not even trying to view it from his perspective.

Even though he didn't handle things ""right,"" if you look at it from his view point it's far from him being selfish or something.

ixAp0c,skateboarding,1389214760.0,"A few weeks of cruising will get you comfortable on the board.  Don't focus on tricks in your early stages of riding, just focus on being able to stand on the board stationary first.

Put it on grass or something like a carpet just to stand on it and get a feel for what it's like to be on a skateboard.

Then once you are comfortable with that, try it on a flat smooth surface you can skate on, like a basement (rain or winter) or a street with little to no traffic.  

Check out Braille Skateboarding on youtube, he has some tutorials on basics like Pushing &amp; Riding, How to Ride off Curbs, Loose Trucks vs Tight Trucks, How to Ollie, and more advanced stuff.

&gt;TL;DR; Am I ruining our relationship by going travelling? 

Yes. And I'm a seasoned traveller, so I understand the desire to travel. But you two seem to be operating with different goals in mind. 

Seeing each other two times in 8 months is not a relationship. Why not call things off with your SO? You seem like you have the travel bug. If your SO were going with you, then there'd be no problem. But he isn't. Your actions (or his lack thereof) are straining the relationship. 

At this point, your long term plan to work in your old university town needs to have real timelines and realistic goals. If not, it's just an ephemeral pipe dream. If you want to salvage the relationship, I'd recommend making sure you and your SO actually have specific dates that are no more than 3 months away from today for when you will be moving there.

On a side note, it really bothers me when SJWs disregard ""class privilege,"" which is far more important than ""race privilege"" will every be in any context ever.

Domstolen själv håller inte på att plocka fram bevis, om det skulle visa sig att man använt sig av den här tråden är det ett uppenbart rättegångsfel och domen skulle upphävas i högre instans.

balathustrius,mead,1389215022.0,"I make a lot of meads at 11%-11.5% alcohol, mostly because I can use 1 gallon (~12 lbs) of honey per 5 gallons of must.

It should be around 11.8%, if you used 2.5 lbs of honey and it ferments dry. It may be that fermentation hasn't yet run its full course - the last 10% can take up half the fermentation time, depending on yeast used, nutrients available, and so forth. I assume you looked at the airlock to see if it was still bubbling. At this stage, it *may* be, with bubbles happening every 5-10 minutes. Check the gravity again in a week and see if there's been a change.

A couple other causes for error: 11% vs 11.8% can be a matter of inexact hydrometer measurements *or* leaving too much honey in the jar during the must's creation. Remember to be sure you're correctly calibrating your hydrometer reading for temperature. Most hydrometers are calibrated for 60F or 68F. It should say on the hydrometer. When initially adding the honey, it also helps to gently heat the jar after the initial pour, just to get the last bit. Sometimes it seems like 5-10% can cling to the walls, depending on the size of the jar. I put them on top of my radiator for 10 minutes or so, if they're glass. Othewise, hot water bath."

Even watching the match on Monday you could tell that they are booking him to get sympathy despite being aligned with a supposed heel faction.

He can teach them a thing or two as well. 

I'm suspicious if the Wyatts are even heels because they almost always fight out of the babyface corner on TV in tag matches(facing the hard camera). Yes, they came out attacking superstars when they debuted, but since they put Kane out, they have been laser focused on Daniel Bryan. Even Bray's cryptic babble has been very pointed about how they are going after Daniel Bryan. They couldn't care less about the rest of the roster. They just want to take down the machine.

So, couldn't *that* be changed?

&gt; if you are going to treat people differently in any way (including the legal term for their relationship), you need to justify it with an actual harmful outcome.

This argument could be used to justify shoplifting

So if someone steals a sweater from Target, no individual takes a loss.  Each employee, shareholder and customer takes a loss several orders of magnitude lower than the minimum legal US denomination $0.001.  Practically speaking, the loss is zero.  So if there is no harmful outcome, then should we legally call shoplifting ""purchasing?""  Aren't we treating those who are inclined to shoplift differently than those who prefer to purchase?"

We don't have the rust that northern states do, I can pull suspension pieces off cars with over 100,000 miles that have not a spot of rust on them and I can expect all the nuts and bolts to come apart freely and be reused. 

My first car in 1990 was a 1982 Accord.  Most of my friends drove cars from the early 80's.  *All* of them were considered used up beaters.  A few people had cars from the 70's, but in general, those cars didn't last and if you had one, it wouldn't get you to school at least one day a week.  It would have serious, serious issues.   There might have been one or two 60's muscle cars and one kid had a 57 Chevy his dad restored. 

To put that in perspective, assuming I was driving today: that Accord of mine would be a 2006 model, the few 70's cars would date to 2004 (late 70's) to 1994 (early 70's), there would be virtually no cars left from the mid-80's to the mid-90s, and one kid would be driving around in a 1982 3-series.

Once their prey collapsed and died, they would simply take it home. 

* Humans also recover like no other. If a human breaks a bone, it can heal. Just give it time and it will get back to 100%. There's a reason we put down horses that break their legs. Those horses will never completely recover. Their leg will hurt them forever, and it will never have the same weight bearing capacity again. Again, these regenerative powers are basically exclusively human. Likewise, humans have the best immune system of any creature that I'm aware of. If we get sick, we normally have a decent chance of surviving it. Other animals get fucked.


Anyway, hope this explains some stuff. "

An extravert doesn't interact with a lot more people than an introvert in such a society if they're both socially functioning beings. That is, if they study, work, have hobbies that they might share with others, if they play sports of any kind, etc.

namer98,Christianity,1389215494.0,"&gt; keep in mind that I do not believe it is a sin to correctly interpret the Law to others

Woah. Interpret? You can't do that. Who are you to do that? You said only Jesus can decide what is right and wrong. Are you now also doing that?

&gt;I still do not see how we can translate Genesis 18:8 to say Abraham cooked a kid in its mother's milk,

Because dressing something is often a part of the cooking process. With salad being the exception.

&gt;However, this is even more minute than straining a gnat, so I should redouble my efforts to strain camel-sized things. How bitterly hypocritical would I be to hate a brother while theorizing boiled molecules?

If you can't see it, how can you know to strain it? So don't worry about it. I do check my lettuce for bugs, washing it and holding it to a bright light. Because I am careful not to eat bugs like God commanded.

Now, why is gathering sticks so bad? Why gathering? Why sticks? Why is a fire, basic requirements for food and heat barred on the Sabbath? How does any of this make sense? If a fire, required for cooking is barred, isn't is possible that gathering grains is also barred? The text does not say whether the sticks were the problem, the gathering was the problem, or both together was the problem. But you really need to think, why fire? And why is fire mentioned where it is mentioned? Surely a perfect God does not toss things in haphazardly."

Kids have their own medication all the time anyway, having it at school wouldn't be anything new and they would probably be as responsible as they would be any other time of the day.

SublethalDose,socialskills,1389215803.0,"&gt; I just feel like everybody's gonna be looking at me which makes me really uncomfortable.

Sometimes that's the point of expressing anger:  to draw attention to a situation so that an injustice is remedied or a bad actor is shamed.  That's when you express yourself in an intense, head-turning way.  At other times, when your intention is just to express your emotion for general self-expression/social-syncing purposes, you should be able to express anger in a less urgent, less attention-getting way.  That means there's a scale of expression from ""WHAT THE FUCK MAN, THAT'S MY WIFE YOUR DICK IS IN"" to ""Great, thanks to you I missed the first thirty seconds of Archer.""

Unfortunately, the scale is pretty arbitrary.  In some families and other groups of people, loud displays of negative emotions are treated as particularly horrifying and dangerous.  People keep themselves under tight control and freak out when somebody breaks the rules by giving free vent to anger.  In other families, people yell all the time.  When people from different backgrounds get together, it does not work well.  A person from a loud background is completely out of the loop because the emotions of the restrained people just don't register with them.  To them, it looks like the restrained people have no emotions at all, which is confusing and disconcerting.  A person from a restrained background is stressed out all the time because expressions of minor negative emotion from the loud people sound like EMERGENCY HOLY FUCK EMERGENCY all the time.   As a result, they're constantly juiced up on adrenaline over nothing, not to mention that their subtle expressions of emotion (raised eyebrows and so forth) which are understood by people from their own background are not even noticed by people from a ""loud"" background, so their feelings are never taken into account.

The lesson is to be aware of the people around you and try to calibrate your emotional loudness to match theirs.

ender2021,AskWomen,1389215808.0,"Let me suggest something a little out there - acquire a [female condom](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/female-condom-4223.htm) and try using it.

I say this not because I think you should actually use this as a long-term solution (female condoms are ridiculous), but for these two reasons:

* It will help you empathize with guys who have a hard time with male condoms.  Barrier methods are fairly effective at preventing STI transmission, but for the guy it's like going to a petting zoo wearing workman's gloves.  You can still touch the animals, but it just won't be that much fun.
* It demonstrates to partners that what you are interested in is safety and personal responsibility.  By doing this, you take the onus for these things off of your partner and show them that because it is your worry, you are willing to be the one to make the ""sacrifice"" of wearing protection.

As for the issues you list which lead to your requirement for barrier protection:

**Pregnancy**

There is ALWAYS a risk of pregnancy when you engage in sexual intercourse.  You are of course reducing your risk by using two forms of BC, but don't fool yourself into thinking this makes you completely safe.  I'm not saying you shouldn't double up, just be aware that abstinence is the only 100% effective method of BC.  If pregnancy is your main concern, there are [many other BC options to explore](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-effectiveness-chart-22710.htm), a few of which are even more effective than the pill and condom (such as an IUD).

**STI Transmission**

Slice it any way you like, this IS a trust issue.  Fear of pregnancy is never entirely a trust issue, because every man (assuming he still has the necessary equipment) can potentially impregnate you if you have sex with him, regardless of protection used.  However, *not everyone is a potential disease vector*.  The only time you need to worry about an STI is when you can't trust your partner to both be aware of their state of health and to be honest with you about it.  I agree that it is worrisome that there is no HPV test for men - however, there are mitigating factors:

  * [Condoms reduce, but *do not eliminate* the chances of HPV transmission](http://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/brief.html).  As with pregnancy, the only way to prevent STIs 100% of the time is avoid intimate contact with an infected person.
  * [You can be vaccinated for HPV](http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/STDFact-HPV-vaccine-young-women.htm).  Again, this comes back to you taking personal responsibility for your own sexual health.

The bottom line, though, is that once you've seen your partner's STI test come back clean at least one time, then it becomes a trust issue.  You and your partner should both still get tested regularly, as this is just plain good sense for anyone who is sexually active.  However, except in the VERY rare occasion, you don't just fall ass-backwards into an STI.  The vast majority can be transmitted only by close skin-to-skin contact or exchange of bodily fluids.  If your partner is worthy of your trust, it shouldn't be hard for them to behave in such a way that they will not acquire an STI.

**All That Being Said**

If you are taking personal responsibility for your own sexual health and you are understanding/compassionate/patient towards your partner, then it is fair to both expect and demand the same from them.  If you do all that, and they are still unwilling or unable to have sex with you in a way that makes you comfortable, then you'd certainly be justified in terminating the relationship."

so 

&gt; I was just surprised because I didn't expect it to be much higher. I don't see you as a big person

Is also a compliment, telling you he do not find you big. 

What he is truly saying : **""I don't find you big, but I think your size is""**. 

What is important : he is considering that anyone with size 6 or more is a ""big"" person. It's his point of view, but nothing say you can't change it. Especially when you have some scientific data to help you (healthy BMI) against (unrealistic) standard found in models. 

Maybe he doesn't realize it. He has obviously a preference for very slim girl. But when he make some ""offensive"" comments, shouldn't you tell him? For example : ""listen, I'm size 6, and I do not wish to become a size 2. Yeah, I want to be attractive in your eyes, but most important, I want to be attractive in my own eyes. I want to respect my body, and you are asking me to become something that could not be healthy. So can you live with that, or is the relationship dead?""

I do think that physical attraction is not the most important point in a relationship. So whether you should pursue it or not depend on all the other mental aspect. Do you think you've become a better human being with him? 

I think his comment was ""the last straw that broke the camel back"", but this probably wasn't voluntary hurtful. He shared his vision, and you got infuriated. For your future relationship, try to keep calm, and point out why this comment made you feel bad. Remember you are here to discuss and progress together, and what seems logical to you isn't necessarily the case for him.

It's the same concern I'm sure a lot of progressive parents would have against a radical or right leaning preacher.

I don't like it when an interviewer attacks the interviewee.  It's like in a casino when the dealer purposely cheats someone who's been winning a lot, there's nothing the player can do about it.

It's just that we're not always going to get anywhere unless we ask the more controversial questions.  More information can be obtained when the interview is more like a debate, because the people are more quick and willing to respond.

Say a game dev is being interviewed about their upcoming game.  Their last game was absolutely abysmal and fans aren't sure about this one.  Most interviewers and journalists will  just basically ask about this game specifically, but people really like the kind of interviewer who will stand up and say, ""How have you prepared to make sure that this game isn't going to fail like the last?"" Or more subtly, ""What have you learned from your recent failings in the industry?""  O'Reily interviews like that, putting someone on the spot so that people can get their questions answered.

You can go up to the mic and have a nice and neutral interview where you tell the audience about your game and nothing else, or you can go ahead and answer these questions that people want answered.  Answering those types of questions actually has helped Manson in a way.  Because now, I guarantee you, there is at least one more person who now sees him in a newer light, one that is not as negative as before."

Potato chips have less cholesterol and sodium but they have carbs and more fat. I also don't find a portion to be as filling even though it is three chips more (and it is twice the calories). 

It is better for me. The cholesterol is okay because I do not go over my daily amount. Which is 300mg. Sodium goes up to 2300mg so I'm alright there too.

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1389216189.0,"No, they're as pissy as this. Or worse.

A local anarchist group who's associated with our local Occupy movement got word that one of the business's owners had been cooperating with the police. Long story short, she answered a question about how many people were going to be attending an event because she assumed it was for crowd-control purposes. And she had just been involved in an initiative to widen the sidewalks at an event after a woman and her baby in a stroller had been mowed down by a car because of a lack of police and city-planning involvement in an event that got unmanageably big. So she thought it was a public safety issue.

It wasn't, they (the police) went to the event with information they gathered from her and other community people who cooperated with the police, and arrested people.

So some big Occupy publication put out records of the email chains involved in the sting that led to those arrests, and our owner was named by name. None of the rest of the relevant information (that she was constantly in contact with the police as a matter of public safety, and the lady with the baby incident, or that she didn't know it would lead to arrests) was mentioned in the report, just that her emails, along with others, led to arrests.

So then we had about three dozen anarchists shitting up our Twitter and Facebook feeds with accusations of our entire organization being fascists, and how nobody should shop here. Despite that owner being involved in with the police through her *other* business (this store is located in an entirely different city from where those events took place), not this one, people still went full fucking potato. They spammed Yelp with 1-star reviews, contacted all the local media outlets, and protested outside the store.

I had someone follow me to my car and call me a fascist. That was fun."

feedmahfish,AskScienceDiscussion,1389216339.0,"Are you undecided based on the science?  Or based on the socio-economic implications of GMO?

In other words, what do you mean ""the possibility of handing  more control to coporations?""  Why should that be a consideration in the ethical treatment of GMOs?  If that's the case, then you are already decided on GMOs in that they are safe, but you are afraid of producing them because production can't be controlled by the government... which is a weird idea to have.

Government does in fact strongly regulate agricultural production at all levels, whether local, regional, or federal.  Corporations have to abide by those regulations.  There's no such thing as uncontrolled farming.  Farmers have to follow strict regulations for wastes, land use, and production quotas.  GMO farms would fall under the same umbrella.  The only way to avoid that is to lobby for a relaxation of legislation geared towards agricultural growout for GMOs.  The fact that these are modified using a different trade practice, the practice has to be understood and regulated accordingly because these are food.  It is no different then people using chemical preservatives in food.

Will corporations outcompete the little man?  Yes.  Some will.  Others won't.  It takes a LOT of time and money to start up a farm.  It'd be better to buy out the little man and switch crop plans than it would be to buy 1000 acres and plop a big GMO farm next to a quite successful one.  That's economically foolish.  Will GMOs spike prices?  Possibly, unless seed producers realize that they can market non-GMO'd processed seeds (term them naturally produced to avoid the GMO misnomer), then actually I can see them co-existing as a ""higher-quality"" food while calling GMO food ""bulk food"".  Whole Foods type stores will sprout up everywhere and farmers can have wider markets.  I'm seeing some win-win going on here.

Thus, you're big worry is not at the corporations themselves, but at the lobbies and congressmen who might reduce control over GMO farming.  But due to the fact that regular farming would be tied in closely with GMO farming, it'd be a tough sell in any Congress (republican or democrat) to just play favorites for the corporation focusing on GMO growout.  Farming is not the music industry or movie industry.  If agriculture grinds to a halt due to playing of favorites, we all suffer.

I don't think GMO corporations are going to be a big worry."

The cool part for BJJ competitions for me is that they are completely meaningless. Wining and losing has absolutely no bearing on my life and are completely beside the point. Of course I want to win, but it absolutely doesn't matter if I do. I have zero parts of my identity tied up in it.  

I posted something a while back and it had a quote from the guy's coach where he said something like ""There are a billion people in China that don't give a fuck who wins today, you shouldn't either""."
Genghis_Khant_,IWantOut,1389216403.0,"My boyfriend moved here from Japan, I'm a u.s. Citizen, it was ""easy"" for him to move here because he came with a f1 student visa though, then searched for work that would sponsor (because honestly they want face to face interviews most of the time, unless you're lucky) my boyfriend already had a degree (as most japanese do when they come but they often enroll in crappy English language schools for the visa). 

Now I know you obviously speak English, though maybe you can nail a visa with some short term school, if you have the funds, and look for work. I'm not sure if this helps but it's what my boyfriend did. Now we are trying to move to Germany lol :( 

Although I think if it's your dream, don't let anyone get in your way. If you land in NYC and hate it, you've got 49 other states to try they all have their different flavors and I honestly feel there is a place for everyone here. (We are moving only because my dream is to live in Germany haha) "
acsempronio,skyrim,1389216405.0,"33 yo, 2 kids, wife.

On a Monday, Wednesday,and Friday:

* ~ 18:00: Come home,change, unpack bag, repack bag
* Hang with kids
* 19:00: Eat light Dinner
* 19:30: Dishes + Cleanup or Kids Bath (we switch from time to time)
* 20:15: Hang with Kids... little one usually wants to be held to fall asleep
* 21:00 - 21:30: Wife moves to bed.  Older one (hopefully) starts to calm down.
* Put away any laundry from the day. iron any clothes for the next day, clean up kids' mess.
* Eat second light dinner, play computer until between 00:00 and 01:00

Skyrim gets a big chunk of that time, usually in excess of an hour.

I pepper AC4 in as well.

Tuesday:

* 17:00 - 20:00: BJJ/MMA/KM gym time
* ~ 21:00 arrive home.
* Greet kids, help get them in bed.
* clean up any messes
* shower
* ~ 22:30: eat only dinner and play computer until about 00:00

Thursday. same as Tuesday with less gym time and ~20:00 arrive home.

Weekends are a toss-up.  It depends on my wife's schedule (she's a goer-outter, I'm not so much,) what activities are planned, dinner plans, etc.  I will sometimes wake-up before everyone else, shower, dress, make coffee and play *something* before everyone is even starting to stir.

Occasionally I have doctor's/dentist/important daytime errands scheduled on a work day that take a few hours, so I just take off work that day.  The remainder is making sure the house is clean and laundry is done (Wife seems to like this) and Skyrim bingeing. "

But lambasting backwards cultures is easy from afar, but doesn't really tell you anything other than 'these are poor uneducated people who have strange rules'.  I tend to see most Islamic states about 200-150 years behind the times socially...as they did not have, or are just now having, enlightenment movements.

Islamic culture isn't singlehandedly caused by the Quran or anything else.  Ignorance reigns here, and ignorance champions the worst of the Quran, and any other fear based philosophy it can find.

It's true that Islam caught fire because of it's fundamentalist tendencies, but I think critiquing the Quran directly is a better starting point then trying to pin all social problems on it.  It's a catalyst for repression, a piece of a puzzle, but is not essential for it, and will probably be reinterpreted in far more moderate ways in the coming years as the old ways die out."

tobephair,truegaming,1389216630.0,"I think the root of Killzone's problem is in its title. I mean 'Killzone' sounds like a parody of a game title. Something the Simpsons would feature in an episode, as 'the latest violent video game all the kids are playing'.

I speak having enjoyed the second and third game, and most recently the Vita game. I do genuinely like the series, I do think it is a bit cumbersome and po-faced most of the times. But I do appreciate how it depicts the greyer areas of war, and the graphical fidelity and the feel of those firefights are certainly hard to beat. 

I think for a larger audience it is in the difficult position of being considered to formulaic, as a dark overly serious sci-fi FPS. Halo by its nature is kind of colourful and the master chief is kind of a faceless avatar the player can look up to, rather than the characters of Killzone who are mainly grunts. 

Leading on from that, I do think its quite an oppressive shooter especially in terms of tone and feel. Killzone is just very cold. It's less space opera like Halo, its a more realistic sci-fi, that is always a little harder to swallow. I'm speaking more about the second game which was highly industrial in setting along with urban grim dark warzones. At the time, the controls were a little inaccessible when compared to COD and Halo. In addition Killzone, was the game most likely to give the player shellshock, because the heft of noise from those fire fights are what made Killzone unique. As far as I can remember, the third game did try to mix things up with ice and Helghan swamps. I think they even made Rico more likable and tolerable as a character. 

I think its problem is also related to the PSN. There is a reason why COD is treated practically as an Xbox exclusive. Xbox live for the 360 was just a way better interface and Halo practically pioneered matchmaking on consoles. If your friends are playing any shooters on consoles its most likely to be COD or Halo. I was always hard pressed to find friends to play Killzone with, even though the multiplayer was a blast. "

That's a definitely a good sign. As long as you both are committed to making this work it can happen. You both just need to keep trying.

On the big issues it definitely should (your future together, travel, him leaving you in the rain for almost two hours), but small things don't have to be perfect every time.

Also, with the issue of him picking you up, maybe in the future he can text you when he leaves to pick you up. That way when you get out of class you can see if he's texted you and if not you can call him immediately and see what's up. Or if he hasn't texted, you can call and tell him you'll just catch the bus. That way you're not waiting outside for so long expecting him. "

Personally, I cook. Most of the time my family ends up partaking in the spoils of that activity. Sometimes I'll try to cook something challenging simply for the hell of it, but most of the time it's to provide a good meal.

That beings said, the simple act of cooking is still extremely therapeutic for me. I find my zen in the kitchen. There is something that is just innately satisfying about the process, even if it involves a particularly challenging recipe or complicated prep work. Regardless of who benefits, I feel fulfilled at the end of it.

You ultimately have to be the judge about what you find ""relaxing."" Sometimes, finding an activity that you can simply do on autopilot can do wonders for relieving stress. While your therapist may have a point about there being a need for you to do something more specifically for yourself, don't discount the benefit in how good you can feel after just getting something *done.*"
Dajbman22,AskMen,1389216790.0,"&gt;It is hard to be ""unhealthily"" underweight barring either eating disorders or malnutrition.

Actually body weight significantly below optimal ranges, especially in females, has a lot of direct negative effects on the body and significantly reduces the immune response, even with a full compliment of supplements. A restrictive calorie diet, even a fully monitored one, would never be advisable for someone already considered medically underweight. While it may be possible to have normal labs when underweight if you have a perfectly calibrated intake and have basically been at a lower weight since early childhood (thus your organs are used to this state of calorie intake and fat/muscle composition), it is anything but hard to slip into being ""unhealthy"". This is similar to the opposite end of the spectrum, where there are outliers of obese individuals with healthy blood cultures, low BP, strong respiration, etc, it is much harder to achieve that status at that weight than it is to appear unhealthy on at least one of those metrics. Most bodies do not take to long term extremes well, only rare outliers can really adapt fully."

It could still fit with Stannis' sense of justice and law. Remember he's fighting not because he wants the throne, but because it lawfully has come to him. He fights the Lannisters because they have a false claim to the throne. If someone with a legitimate claim took the Iron Throne, I could see Stannis stepping aside.

If you were to ask my honest opinion on it, I'd say it's about the most selfish and cowardly thing a person can do. And I don't want to sound boastful or like I am putting down those who are already put down, but I don't think there's justifying ending it all over suffering. I've been to the darkest parts of myself, the most desperate and hopeless...and forgive me, but *it got better*. I cried out for help and I got put on the back burner for years but I held on and today I'm so thankful, not that I was brave, but because ""give up"" simply isn't in my tool kit. I hung on because I couldn't stomach what killing myself would do to my mother, I hung on because I'm too proud to back down. And I'm really glad I did. And I saved another lost soul and dragged him out of despair in the process.

Many pardons, I went on an emotional tangent and just sort of spurted out train of thought, but maybe something I said has merit. For me, suffering was worth the serenity I have now, and the life I saved besides my own. And that's what I'm talking about when I say suicide is selfish, because I don't think my sudden and permanent relief outweighs the consequences it wreaks on other people.

I feel like I've had my share of shitty cards in my hand, but I made do with what I had and made it work for me where I could. I don't feel like those who have already taken their lives should be scorned or mocked or made out as too weak to get through it, but anything I can do to discourage someone thinking about doing it too, anything I can do to make it harder to do, I think is worth doing.

the main reason I chose it for my income source.

&gt; I have a theoretical PvP/PvE fitting for the stratios for exactly those kind of situations, though not tested yet.

a hybrid fit still can't stand up to a proper pvp ship assuming either pilot is not an idiot about it.

I use a Deimos for hunting, and I've yet to encounter a single cruiser that can deal with it. A duel rep legion once put up a fight for like 2 minutes, but it was never close.

BS are rare and usually are scared easily, I haven't solo killed one yet but I would try.

the funniest combo I encounter was a guy that was running 3 accounts to run a plex. But instead of using his 3 chars to get it over quickly, he brought an oracle and 2 guardians into a 5/10. 
I got him tackled, used up half my capboosters but I had no chance breaking him. So I had to warp out and leave the plex to him (he also had corpmates nearby, but nobody came to help him).
So I guess thats also a way to do it ;)"

Now, though, with all of these moralistic judgment calls because of known cheating, rumored cheating, or imagined cheating, things are clouded, and getting to the 75-percent induction threshold isn't as simple as it once was.

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1389217241.0,"You know I ""got by"" because I moved a lot and was completely uninterested in school by the time I was in high school.

 I was in a school district that shoved me in classes for people who spoke English as a second language, despite the fact I don't know Spanish, (California). I had one school treat me like I was mentally handicapped because I had poor handwriting, and instead of helping me improve upon my handwriting, I got shoved into a class room full of delinquents and given a computer. That was Arizona. And these were during critical times in my life so when I felt the schools gave up on me, I gave up on the schools and that was a BAD mentality that stuck with me.  

I grew up having little to no use for education and I do regret that. I was under the impression grades showed how smart someone was and now that I'm an adult, it isn't. Grades show how driven a student is and how hard they are willing to work. **THAT** is why colleges look for good grades. You will be spending time and money at their facility, they don't want someone who will piss it away. I was told I was frighteningly intelligent, but constantly asked why I had poor grades. Again, I wasn't stupid, just not driven. 

So yes, your assignments may feel like total shit, but work at them and you might get something for your efforts. My brother worked his ass off in AP and college level course and is now in Guam for the Navy, looking to get a doctorate in Nuclear Engineering when he gets out. But he's halfway there because he worked hard and the Navy was and is willing to pay for his education. 

What about me? I made it out by the skin of my teeth. I graduated on Ds and Cs. I was however certified in Early Childhood Education and even did college work in that field because that was something I enjoyed. Yeah, a whole lotta good that did for me. I'm certified to be an aid for day cares or pre-schools, but unfortunately as needed as a man is in those fields, no one is willing to hire one. All that got me was a 9 month stint as a substitute.  

I spent 3 years with harsh unemployment, struggling to find work to help out my parents, getting threatened with eviction from my father because I wasn't working (despite my trying and taking up on HORRID temp jobs). 

I did find work with a hardware store, then a Dominos and sadly, despite working myself sick working 75 hours a week between two jobs, I still could hardly afford to put gas in my car and ultimately had to quit one job because my mother is now disabled and blind and needed someone who was home more often then not because my sister is school, my brother is in Guam, and my father is now working two jobs and she needs the help just to get around. 

I now work at a Dominos, making pizzas and I bring home less then $800 in a month. I guess I don't really regret my decisions because I should have known better and instead of dwelling on my past mistakes, I'm waiting until my family moves back out to Oregon and I'm going to do my damnedest to fix my situation, learn from my mistakes. These past 3 years have been brutal on me and have taken a toll on my mental health, but I'm fighting though it.

So don't give up. Work tirelessly and as hard as you can because hard work is what gets noticed in the end and hard work is what sets you up for a good future.

The other big challenge I remember is Shostakovich's song cycle *Seven Verses by Alexander Blok* - I only did two movements (which were plenty challenging already) but I think it would be really amazing to sing the whole cycle, although like I said, easily one of the hardest things I've ever looked at. 

There's more out there, of course, in terms of extremely challenging repertoire - most operatic repertoire certainly isn't easy, especially once you get into the later romantics like Verdi and Wagner. Of course, that's assuming you even have the voice type for that kind of music. 

Now, I totally don't think that singing ""challenging"" pieces means anything - I know I would always be more likely to support someone who sings ""simple"" pieces well than ""challenging"" pieces poorly, not to mention even parsing whether a piece is challenging or simply a bad fit for the person's voice type.

Piracy is more rampant with Android users because it's much easier. Apple didn't tell the developers to release it for money, Apple just let the app through. Apple doesn't really work together with developers, telling them what to do, Apple just approves or denies applications from their App Store."

Prancemaster,SquaredCircle,1389217340.0,"&gt;I am of the opinion that you really don't understand what it is like to see a roster of decent female wrestlers actually pull off great matches.

Nah, I know what it's like. I have seen my fair share of legit women's wrestling in the indies and, more recently, TNA. 

&gt;You'll have to excuse me if I don't see many of the WWE diva matches as even close to what a real female wrestler can do.

I do excuse you for this. However, I'm well aware of how terrible-by-comparison the WWE main roster matches are to the rest of the wrestling world. 

&gt;They are always overlooked and underutilized. Always have they chose entertainment over ability and this goes twofold for the Divas. 

This trend has been turning around in recent months with the divas getting more time to wrestle matches on the B-shows. NXT, in particular, has had some of the best women's wrestling matches I've seen in the last year outside of the indies. 

&gt;Not so many years ago, TNA had one of the best women's division ever. They put on matches that were more entertaining than ANYTHING WWE has ever done with women.

If SHINE didn't exist, TNA would still have the best women's division ever and they have what, seven wrestlers in that division total? 

&gt;If you watch this match and tell me that you don't see my point, then you are just being argumentative for the sake of being argumentative.

I see your point. I just think you need to dial down the assumptions about me a little bit. "

I bring this up because you are obviously very concerned about protecting South Korea's borders, yet are apparently unaware of the fact that South Korea often makes efforts to normalize cultural and political relations with the North. You see, the South has a bigger stake in this than anyone else and has the most to lose, but even they realize that while the regime in the North is deplorable that the best chance to avoid disaster, and at the same time improve the overall situation, is to try to get the North to open up to more exposure from the outside and to convince the government and people in the North to stop being so paranoid. 

They know that there are basically 3 different choices: military conflict with the North - which would result in an absolutely catastrophic loss of life; total isolation of the North - which would only confirm the regime's claims to the people that the rest of the world is against them and eventually and inevitably lead to the aforementioned military conflict; or working to open up the North to the rest of the world in an attempt to change the culture and mindset. Now unlike simple minded neocon types such as yourself, they understand that the first two choices are unacceptable and completely counterproductive when it comes to their security and survival.

I think this

&gt;make people relive that trauma **if they are not prepared for it**

is the really important idea. We should work to make people *better-prepared* to deal with triggers, rather than attempt to shield people from them. 

The idea that we should protect people by shielding them from difficulties rather than making them better able to deal with them is a  common one, but it's troublesome. That idea has arguably caused great damage in many areas, from the school system (where coddling kids makes them unable to deal with academic failure or bullies), to our immune system (overzealous use of antibiotics and sterilization have helped increase the prevalence of superbugs and possibly autoimmune disorders)."

Life-in-Death,vegan,1389217628.0,"I am familiar with the idea of limiting reagents...

The thing is most of our protein is conserved in our body.  We are not burning it for energy like carbohydrates or fats.

&gt;In the theoretical average 62.5kg person, about 240 g of protein is synthesized and degraded daily. This process requires about 260g of amino acid, of this amount about 1/6 must come from diet. This means that only about 1/6 of the amino acids released by endogenous protein degradation are not recycled. Where does all this protein come from? A large part (maybe even more than half) of it comes from the digestive juices, from the instestinal mucosal cells, breakdown of muscle and other tissues, etc.

http://www.timinvermont.com/fitness/vegprotn.htm

Soybeans and quinoa, two vegan staples are ""complete"" proteins.

Yes, varying your protein sources is good.  Traditional grain and legume dishes developed for a reason.  But unless you have an extremely limited diet, your body is never going to be sitting with a hot dog looking for a hot dog bun.

The chart below didn't format too well, but it shows eating just crappy baked potatoes gives you all you need of EVERY protein:

&gt;The following table shows the amino acid requirements of adults as recommended by the World Health Organization[3] calculated for a 62-kilogram adult, and the amino acid profile of 2530 kilocalories of baked potatoes (9 large baked potatoes),[4] which comprise a day's worth of calories for a 62-kilogram (136 lb.) adult:[5]
Essential Amino Acid	Requirement mg/day/62 kg adult	9 large baked potatoes

Dajbman22,AskMen,1389217763.0,"As pointed out by others, being medically underweight, actively restricting calories, and denying there is an issue with doing so are enough to screen in for Annorexia Nervosa in the DSM-V. Therefore you are actually asking about a girl in all likelihood suffering from some clinical eating disorder.

I was in a relationship with someone who developed an eating disorder as a comorbidity of existing Major Depression (official Dx was ED NoS, but her primary behaviors fit the now more inclusive Dx of Anorexia seen in the DSM V).

I tried to save her. I thought I was doing everything I could to encourage her to eat and to just reinforce that I thought she was beautiful. I ignored that the issue had much more to do with control and compulsion than about actually thinking she was ugly. She probably would have left eventually anyway, she needed to cut all ties to really jump into treatment. Looking back, though, I still feel terrible for my misguided and ultimately probably harmful attempts to help her, be her knight in shining armor. I was naive and just swinging wildly at an invisible monster literally eating away at the woman I loved.

I should have just supported her, consistently. I should have pushed harder for more intense care sooner, not just thinking of how that would affect our time together. I shouldn't have pushed about eating, then felt guilty and retreated as an enabler. I should have addressed how the stress was affecting me, not let it just boil over and eat away at me. I should have done a lot, but I was only 19."

In the books, Sam Tarly's research suggests the historical accounts are biased and inaccurate. So although the histories speak of ages lasting thousands of years, I don't think we're meant to take that at face value. 

A couple millennia to get from bronze age society to medieval feudal society isn't too unbelievable, especially since half the continent is subject to winters lasting several years.

Most often, it is a combination of relationship issues and individual issues, but the individual issues can certainly be the driving factor in the infidelity. That was the case with me.

luxury_banana,TheRedPill,1389217836.0,"Not every guy can. Let's be real here. Genetics are obviously a huge thing. Height below around 5'10"" is a massive dealbreaker for any woman who isn't in wall panic phase of her life i.e. young women who would be worth a shot at serious commitment with. As is male pattern baldness, and of course your facial structure and I'm sure if women could easily assess things like penis size without an unrealistic amount of effort leading to opportunity cost, they would also be factored in.

Now as for things you can actually work on, body shape is one of the few real things where you're almost guaranteed returns on your consistent effort. Sure different people get different results, so some guys get results way way easier than others, but if you keep at it you will get a decent looking body shape. The only limiting factor here is available time and some disposable money for supplements, gym memberships or home equipment, that kind of thing. It's realistic for most guys to be able to do this. Not particularly enjoyable for all, though. I find it boring but consistently grind through because I know that not being in decent shape means you're in scrap begging territory unless you're rich, and then you'd be looking at gold diggers.

Intelligence is largely heritable and ""charisma"" as vague as that term is largely happens to be tied to your genetic appearance markers (see: cognitive bias, The Halo Effect) so these are not not exactly meritocratic things. Again like you noted, men tend to occupy extremes. This means there's more male geniuses, but also more mentally retarded men.

And then finally socioeconomic status is something that for obvious reasons related to scarcity and applying game theory not every man can reach the top of either. You can try and you probably should if it doesn't literally consume your life and crush any passion you may have for life in the process, but by virtue of statistics and how things in the real world work it is not feasible for every guy to be a multi-millionaire business owner--you aware of how many new businesses completely fail, yes?

The bottom line is if you put effort in, you can raise your value. How much though is the question, and is not the same for every guy nor is their max potential. This idea that it's all in your hands and that you're able to reach a top sexual marketplace value without a whole lot of luck on your side is just not true, though it is comforting to male psychology as well as congruent with the social side which pushes male hyperagency, but unfortunately is not true because there's quite a bit that is out of your hands. If you didn't win the genetic lottery, you will never be peak SMV. If you don't have amazing luck/know the right people/have the nepotism on your side/get amazing ideas from some flash of genius to create something that sells/whatever, you'll probably also never be truly wealthy, either, which means you'll not end up peak SMV. Wealth can sort of be faked, though, and it's not as important as you'd think."

So here's ""Getting Lost in the Woods in Hooker Heels""

One time my friend Brittany (not my ex girlfriend by the same name, qui j'appelle Crazy Eyes) and I decided to go be really cool and hang out with older boys, when we were like 13.  So we got all dolled up, and then we went shoe shopping.  I bought pretty much [these](http://data1.whicdn.com/images/66674318/large.jpg) and she bought leopard print stilettos.  We walked the like 5 blocks to meet the boys at Starbucks.

When we went to leave, we mutually agreed that no way no how were we walking another 5 blocks in those.  She knew a shortcut, she said! We walked awkwardly through a veteran's park, to the edge of the woods where one could see a rough path.  Just up the path!

It grew dark as we walked the path, but we weren't concerned.  It would take us as long as it took us.  Slowly we began to make sidelong glances at eachother: could the other person still see the path? Surely, or we would have stopped walking.

It had been an hour before we agreed that we were lost.  

We decided to just keep walking ""straight"" because clearly we'd reach the end of the woods if we did that! (editor's note: don't do that, straight is not so obvious)

7 hours later we emerged bleeding and scared at the edge of a parking lot, very very far from home.  But we looked really cool, I'm pretty sure."

Drop_,Games,1389218122.0,"&gt;See, that's my point. The gameplay in The Last of Us acts in subservience to the story. They are not melded together as a single whole like they are in Brothers, a game where game play mechanics and narrative inform each other.

The gameplay mechanics in TLOU are absolutely in service to the story.  They actually enhance the story in a very key way, and IMO the ending of the game would be much less coherent and meaningful without the gameplay. 

When compared to other ""games"" which have story but completely stripped out the game mechanics (e.g. Gone Home, The Walking Dead) TLOU does a much better job of making a story into an actual game. 

While it's perfectly valid to completely strip all game mechanics from a game and focus on the story (love TWD and TWAU), they don't represent nearly as much of a progression in the game and story being a single whole as TLOU.  

In some ways it is analogous to the original MGS, but it has much moved past the point where MGS was, by letting the setting tell more of the story and provide more context, rather than directly explaining the setting to the player.  The biggest example is at the start of MGS where the nanomachine soldiers and Shadow Moses are all explained to the player directly, whereas the analogous things in TLOU are much less explained (though they may have some background in notes you find).

Snugglebuggle,polyamory,1389218200.0,"Wow, I can totally understand your pain and frustration. Probably akin to having the rug pulled out from under you. I kind of get the feeling that you only broached the subject because you felt like you were in a safe and happy environment and were finally free to take the risk, when he suggested divorce (to protect himself) you no longer felt safe and happy.

I would honestly probably feel the same way you do now, but we have to understand that he has done his research. If he truly has looked in to this then he understands that NRE and Polyamory can come with a lot of heavy emotion. If you mix this heavy emotion with a decision that things aren't going to work out between the two of you, this could make for a nasty divorce.

To me it sounds like hes the one taking the potential of the heartbreak on himself and trying to make sure things can happen as amicably as possible, however they go. He is trying to give you what you need while also trying to give himself a way to feel safe.

Relationships are about hardship and compromise. Remember that you probably made him feel initially the way you feel now. Take advantage of this and use it to rebuild together and become even stronger for it, but understand that if you cant find a way to be OK with what he needs, he probably wont be able to do the same."

You need to have a conversation with her about this, where you explain why her behavior is not okay with you. Include the following points:

1) You know how sex works. She's not going to have to show you exactly what to do. She will have to show you what she likes, but she's going to have to do that even with a really experienced guy. Every woman is different.

2) It really hurts your feelings and makes you feel frustrated when she talks about how much she loves and misses sex, then with the next breath says she doesn't want sex with you. It seems like she's teasing you and messing with your head, and it's not cool at all.

3) You really like her, and you don't want to break up over this. However, you do eventually want to have sex with her. If she's really going to be unable to get over the fact that you're a virgin, then you need to get some experience somewhere else, so that you don't stay a virgin forever. It's very unfair of her to expect you to keep being faithful to her when she won't sleep with you because you're not experienced enough.

See what she says to that. Yes, if she just refuses to budge, then she's being mean for no reason and you need to break up with her. But you don't have to right at this minute. Try this first."

feedmahfish,AskScienceDiscussion,1389218238.0,"The biggest risk with any scientist reflecting the evidence according to a special interest is that if he hides evidence, he can be completely discredited: which means you lost all credibility in your research.  It's akin to being fired from the scientific community.  Scientists usually WILL NOT risk being discredited, but unfortunately, lies are abound.

Lies are abound and threaten the scientific process because it occurs at all levels, from the undergraduate copying his essay to the elite scientist on a review committee rejecting a beautiful proposal because he didn't think of it first (then stealing it and going ahead with his own submission).  Or in your example, with a community backed by private interests shutting up dissent.  This happens and is caught only infrequently.  Which is scary!  

The worst offenders, and the toughest to find, are the fudgers of data.  The ones who change a number here or there because they are trying to find a statistical difference or show the effect was large, or that some treatment worked as good or better than expected.  You usually can't tell 100% of the time from looking at a paper.  What's even more deadly is when the data that is presented is false, but looks completely correct in that the numbers are not astoundingly crazy.  For example, we'd be suspicious if somebody said: ""We had a hugely productive crop of catfish [500,000lbs] in the production year""... and then you look closely and you see an ""n"" of 23k+... which means they have fish that are about 21 pounds each.  

In this example, we might unconsciously think, ""Wow, 500,000lbs of fish... that's a lot for fish only... OH 23k+ fish were produced, okay!""  Because we think that 23k+ is a lot of fish in one pond.  But if you start realizing that these fish were catfish, and that market size for catfish is about 2 pounds, and it takes about 2 years to get to market size and this study was done in 15 months.... you can start to see that there are some severe disconnections going on.

From here on, it depends on how well people recognize bullshit when they see it.  Unless you are trying to get brood stock for your ponds, you're not going to buy 21 pound catfish.  Even then, 21 pound catfish on average?  And you have 23 THOUSAND 21-pound catfish?  Bullshit.  But, it's easy to represent this in a way that looks believable, especially to a reviewer.  A liar only gets his work published if he hides his lie from the reviewer.  That's why peer review can be tenuous in that if the reviewer is not paying too close attention, he can accidentally let something slide he should have caught.

So how does the public recognize when somebody's full of it?  Well, truth is, they really probably can't.  Unless the public is educated on the topic the author is discussing.  I can't tell you if a physics paper is right or not, good or bad.  I am not trained in that field.  And you think John Q. Public is?  

Now about the bias issue, let's summarize it up.  If people want to present data that is exclusively biased towards their own work, then unless some outsider is observing the research, there is not much to look for in terms of knowing if the results are clearly misrepresented.  We aren't the author or the reviewer.  It's a huge risk to the scientist to pull such a trick as hiding or lying about results.  But, if the risk is worth the reward, some scientists will do it.  And those that do acknowledging the risk are the most dangerous because they will know how to make their data LOOK convincing...and that's all that's needed.  The average person has little chance, but the trained scientist who scrutinizes everything does."

It sounds like insecurity is a big problem for her, and could have contributed to her infidelity. If that is the case, she needs to recognize this so that she can overcome it. Working past her insecurity will not only prevent her from cheating again -- it will also fix other issues within her marriage and within herself. When someone is deeply insecure, they cannot give all of themselves to their marriage or to their child. So working through this will make her a better mother as well, which I'm sure the OP wants."

tecmec,androiddev,1389218282.0,"From what you're saying, it sounds like you want to build a phone. This would include:

* An EE spec'ing the eleconics components, doing the schematics, and laying out the PCB. 

* A ME or just enclosure designer doing the enclosure design sketches are only the first step. It takes a lot of work to design how the thing with actually go together. Much of this work needs to be done in tandem with the EE doing the electronics design. 

* Someone (maybe the EE) to do the work to get Android running on the device. Not well, but just booting.

* The actual proto run

The EE portion would easily cost $100k+, the enclosure design, at *least* $40k, and the actual proto run (of enclosure and PCB) would be $10k+ for maybe 2 units.

Really, getting to a proto is quite expensive. The only remaining costs for production would be tooling (which is maybe 50% of the costs I mentioned), and the initial capital to actually do a run of however many thousand units. Oh yeah, and regulatory approvals. That'll probably be $100k or so for everything a phone would need.

Most of the costs I mentioned are probably low. I've never designed a phone. Costs would spike dramatically for every custom component you'd need (screen, for example).

Why would you think you can successfully build a phone? There's a reason only big companies build phones. Actually, for a good example of costs, why don't you look into the openmoko project. I bet they have some info.

Yes, China will give you prices that are literally a tenth of what a North American company will quote you. Yes, you're going to get what you pay for.

The study showed that people who read some rape jokes thought they were more likely to rape someone. I'm not sure how that's anything but exactly my point. You can't do a study where you tell someone some rape jokes and then give them the opportunity to actually date-rape someone because that's wildly unethical.

Abeneezer,DotA2,1389218347.0,"&gt;The system uses the mmr to determine matches, and does not look at your win\loss(not loose, though lose is acceptable) ratio at all.

Correct, but in most systems (like in Dota 2) the match-making system will try and match you up with opponents where both teams has an equal chance of winning. This should result in an *equilibrium*, not a forced W/L-ratio, but the system will infinitely strive for 50%. This might not be the case for specific MM's, but in Dota 2, the developers stated it as their first goal: [""The teams are balanced. (Each team has a 50% chance to win.)""](http://blog.dota2.com/2013/12/matchmaking/). Besides isn't this the most fun? Not being stomped and not stomping.

It's true that in some confined match-making systems there will be ultra-top and ultra-bottom, who won't theoretically have no equal opponents to face. But the MM will still try to make match-ups that will consequently bring equilibrium.

W/L-ratios are not primary variables, they are just influenced by MMR, through the Dota 2 MM system."

Blended fabrics is admittedly unclear.  Its ban isn't conclusively limited to ceremonial context, and the ban on it wasn't lifted.  So either it was intended for ceremonial context which no longer applies, or the restrictions still do apply, and I am personally, morally in violation of them.

You asserted the opposite:

This is an all or nothing statement. There is no biological. Purely cultural.

I contested this, using your own ""quoted"" aggression levels remark, you retaliated with racist blackmail, rewriting what i said completely introducing new language like ""crime levels"" which simply were not there in my comments.

Please re-read the context in the link above i provided, its right there.

Now. That said. I will address your next point.

I disagree, i intended to as soon as i got on a *computer* (not a phone) and have done so today, its how i started out.

&gt; Until you prove that you can do that, I have nothing else to say to you.

Now. Allow me to say, i made an absolute statement, in haste and in shallowness of thought, that gender/race was not a social construct. I was wrong. I was wrong when i read last nights flippancy, and i was wrong as i read articles/wikipedia today. 

I dont need to interrogate the assertions to see such binary reasoning was flawed from the instant it was spoken.

So, if you think i wasn't worth speaking with due to such blinkered opinion, i understand why. However i admit my error. Please consider me taking a new direction and engage with me as i engage with your purely sociological perspective. Deal?"
keakealani,musictheory,1389218412.0,"Also just start dictating ""real life examples"" - the themes from major symphonies, Bach chorales, pop songs, whatever.

Most classical music is available at IMSLP or other similar sources to check your work, so that's a good start.

NatashaRomanof,AskWomen,1389218423.0,"Do away with the downvote button entirely. Or at least, downvotes on comments. Yeah yeah reddiquette etc, but let's be real, a lot of people just downvote things they don't agree with. I'm guilty of it sometimes. When I see someone say something I don't like, the quickest and easiest way for me to get that across is hitting the downvote. I try to keep myself from doing that but I don't always succeed. A lot of people don't try to keep from doing that at all. And the downvotes can escalate to a point where people are being silenced, like in brigaded threads, or whatever.

But I think I just miss old style forums where upvotes and downvotes didn't exist and you had to actually say something if you wanted to be a part of the conversation, because those types of forums always felt more open and welcoming, unlike reddit. *shakes cane at the kids on her lawn*"

Dusk, a bright sun in the summer morn' sweeps over the horizon. A clear night has transformed into a lightly clouded sky, with no interaction of any humans in sight. The scent of warm hazelnut coffee meanders through the household as the almost bright sky has filled the room with its hopeful essence. As the small 9"" kitchen TV buzzes with static mixed with a few news anchors at their desks, an odd sound fills your ears... ""*And possibly a high of 61 degrees today will wrap up our broadcast for today, June 25.*"" Unbelievable. The thermometer outside reads about 52 degrees, and you excitedly sprint to the closet to put your pajamas away and take out something you haven't seen in years: a tanktop.

As the rest of the family crawls out of their slumber, you awaken them with the sound of laughter and joy. ""No way! It's happening!""

The thermometer has steadily climbed. 56. *2 minutes pass* 57. *1 minute passes* 58.

It cannot be. No. I want to believe it, but I can't as it is shown to my face. *Please be real. Please, do not mock me yet again.* 

The slow paced red line has grown to an unfamiliar black line that has not been reached before- the 60 F line.

Close. Just one more minute. 

The line begins to slow down, waiting for nearly the whole family to observe this phenomenal feat. 

59.

Just as the family looks on from the window, a noise (probably father's) bellows from the background.

""My phone says 60 outside!""

As the red column picks up pace, a countdown similar to new year's eve has begun. 5...4...3...2...1...

a moment of awkward silence begins, seeming to last for an eternity. And then the red line crossed the 60 F finish line.

60F.

All their canned fruit, meat and veg comes in #10 sizes and they have tons dried soups, gravies, dressings and sauces. you can buy 5lb bags of pasta for a few bucks and pretty much all the meat could be dehydrated and stored in Mylar bags. Pretty much everything in the store has a long term shelf life of 1-5 years or more, either immediately or with a small amount of preparation.

Tech school is divided into 2 parts: Q course and B course. Q course is what everyone does and teaches you the basics of the career field, from electronics fundamentals to soldering to Quantum Physics theory. B course is your specialty and determines where you are to be stationed. There is Remote Sensing, Subsurface Maintenance, Subsurface Analysis, and Special Equipment. They vary in length from 4 weeks to 3 months and your class is split up into these separate courses. Subsurface Analysis, or squiggle watchers, is by far the most boring. Don't volunteer for that. Maintainers and Special Equipment get to go overseas and do fun things.

Every AFSC requires first-term Airmen to be at their fist duty station for a minimum of two years before they are even eligible to PCS. 9S100 only requires one year. I was at Wright-Patt for for 21 months and received my assignment notification after less than a year time on station."

I didn't mind, I continued to ask for help on Reddit, and other social media sites.

The agreement was that the money raised for bentley, would be raised FOR BENTLEY. She used the money just for the satisfaction of putting wrapped boxes under the tree.

shankrabbit,loseit,1389218788.0,"&gt; I would use feeling physically full to distract from my unhappiness.

Wow, a line straight out of my book. 

Everyone is different and each of us need to find our own way, but here was my solution. 

I, like you, figured out that I used the physical feeling of full to distract my unhappiness. I would have dinner, then eat my kids leftover portions, then eat the rest of what was on the stove because it wasn't enough for leftovers. Then I'd snack all night long on popcorn, chips, chocolate, etc. 

So I adopted a mantra: ""Slow down, eat awkward, and over hydrate.""

1. Slow down: I ate WAY too fast... faster than my belly would catch up with my brain and give me the ""all full"". So I needed to slow down, but just mentally I couldn't just bring myself to do it so...
2. Eat Awkward: The easiest way to slow down while eating, I found, is to use your non-dominant sides. I'm right handed, so I started consciously forking with my left hand and chewing primarily on the left side of my mouth (it's really weird how that works). I also started putting my fork down every bite. Those little things REALLY helped. 
3. Over Hydrate: I knew it was the ""full"" feeling that I wanted to use to distract... so whenever I felt that pang, especially after dinner, I'd slam 20oz of water. I'd use water to get to the point of, ""oh god... if I ate now I'd barf"". Maybe I over-did it with that one... but it worked. 

Anyway, that's my story - glean from it what you wish and best of luck to you!"

Diguiseppimon,ADHD,1389218914.0,"Sounds a lot like me. I end up flaking out on friends a lot anymore, because:

1). I can't say no
2). It sounds fun at the time, but when it comes to actually going somewhere and not sleeping instead, I don't wanna do it. 

It's really annoying whenever I make plans, because 99% of the time, I don't follow through with them. I'm almost 25, have been on my meds for a good 10 years, and STILL cant find a way to motivate myself. Example: Weekends are when I don't take my meds, because my boyfriend likes me a lot better when I don't take them, and I like myself better as well. Weekends are my only days to catch up on all the bullshit I've neglected during the week from work. Most specifically, cleaning up my apartment. It almost never happens unless someone (aka my boyfriend) is there basically holding my hand and making sure I stay on task, or if it gets filthy enough that I really can't take it anymore. Sure, I can definitely start cleaning by myself, and have the full intentions of finishing, but then I start one project, and another and another, and then the place is even messier than before. Or listing the rest of my shit on Ebay, so I can have extra cash. I've been telling myself to do this for months, and now that I no longer work in a company where I do that for a living, I just really don't wanna do it unless I REALLY don't have any more money. I'm tired 150% of the time (my psychiatrist actually just told me the other day she wants me to get blood work done to see if I have a thyroid problem), so any time I don't **have** to do something, I would rather sleep. 

Basically, you're not the only one it happens to. Yes, you kinda are a shitty person because of doing things like this (don't worry, you're not alone!), but really, you can't help it. People won't understand that, however. You need to make things right, tell them you are sorry, and get to work, because they are counting on you. From what I have learned from myself, unless it's something that you *reallllllly* want to do/need to do, you're probably not going to do it. If you have friends/SO/family that you live with or interact with daily, maybe talk to them, and tell them that you need guidance, and to remind you to do things. Tell them that they can't leave you alone until you finish what you need to do. My boyfriend is helping me with something similar right now for my 'new years resolution'. I'm an incredibly negative person, and it gets really old. I told him every time I make a negative comment, I want him to help me turn it into a positive comment, so I can get used to thinking of things that way. I am not much help, and rambling. Anyway, you are not the only one in this boat. "

Read r/deadbedrooms to see just how rare it is for a woman to have sex with her husband when she doesn't want to.

Also, in my own case, I cheated on the most attractive boyfriend I've ever had. I was insanely attracted to him even while I was cheating on him. He was the hottest guy I had ever met, and I thought he was totally out of my league. People cheat on attractive spouses with less attractive people all the damn time. Sometimes *because* their spouse is so attractive that it makes them feel insecure.

Remember Jude Law and Sienna Miller? Eric Benet and Halle Berry? There are tons of examples of people downgrading when they cheat.

Drop_,Games,1389219027.0,"IMO what /u/vortexofdoom noted is what TLOU did that put it above and beyond older games of the same formula (gameplay -&gt; cutscene -&gt; gameplay games).  

What the game does is handle the ludonarrative dissonance problem in such a way that not only is it a non-issue, but the gameplay actually informs the story.  

I think you could have a scale in terms of the ludonarrative problem of 2013 games: 

* Tomb Raider - The example of ludonarrative dissonance, the regular girl turned into and completely OK with killing many many people. 

* Bioshock Infinite - A ""neutral"" example where the violent nature of the game is merely explained as part of the main character's past, but this explanation feels more like a justification for the high level of violence in the game, rather than something that truly develops the story told by the game.  

* TLOU - where again the past of the main character justifies his violence, but where the violent nature of the story is integral to the meaningfulness of nearly all the characters and the entire setting of the game, beyond just the story.  "

Then S5 can cover the majority of ADWD/AFFC and very likely some of TWOW too (whether it's released or not). Then S6 can start with the bulk of the TWOW material with some room to close up a few threads on some of the AFFC/ADWD arcs.

I'm an introvert that doesn't like conflict, I enjoy my hobbies which are mostly computer and gaming related. I have a bit of an artistic side, but am absolutely terrible at expressing it. The best I've done is geometric shapes with stained glass (but man do I love stained glass)

I'm shy, overly cautious, don't like making a scene, don't like standing out, and cynical most of the time. My temper is slow to light, but quick to burn, if that makes sense. Friends have said they're terrified when I get angry, so I try my best to control my temper. I've even been called ""too nice"" by a few people. I don't mind that though.

The only issue is that Previn can have sperm in it so if you are doing anything near her bits then it would be smart to wrap it. 

It never bothered me when doing anything. If it was enough, it would just mix in with any lube. 

All that said, communication is always better so go with your feelings/thoughts with each girl. "

marker_sniffer,torrents,1389219129.0,"If you're running Windows, it's really easy.  Make sure your local network connection shows up as Domain or Private in the 'Network and Sharing Center'.  Configure your VPN connection and make sure it's set as a Public network.  Open up the Windows Firewall and create a new rule for a program, select uTorrent, then BLOCK on PRIVATE networks.  Then do Another for ALLOW on PUBLIC networks.  Do that for Incoming and Outgoing.  

If you're using another firewall program, then it should have similar settings.  To test it, grab a linux distro ISO or another which wouldn't get you flagged.  Start it without your VPN enabled.  It should never start.  Then connect to VPN and update the trackers and it should start right up.  Kill your VPN connection, and uTorrent will stop transmitting.  

If you can't figure it out from what I explained, check out this link...

Not all big chains are like that. Many give more authority to local managers than Walmart, especially those that emphasize customer service. I saw a documentary about WalMart that suggested it is company policy to cut costs wherever possible, including not paying overtime, not giving refunds that are deserved, and hiring less employees than a store that size really needs."

There are a taxonomical class of organisms that all have 6 legs, 3 body segments and modified wings that are known as ""insects"" which share similar genome patterns, but their identity have no bearing on aspects of existence independent of humans and there is no true stereotypical insect which is the universal exemplar.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389219174.0,"&gt;There's plenty of rejection in batting your eyelashes and making longtime conversation with a dude

Absolutely!  Do you think that there's even any difference from flirting and being rejected vs. asking and being rejected?  I'm sure I could be wrong, but I would say there isn't.  I've been rejected, and it's really not bad at all.  Some people might say it's different due to the actual confrontation, but to me at least, it didn't add anything.  It was the same ""oh, she's not interested, move on.""

&gt;'oh yes lets! hmm... so there's this new place that opened, did you hear about it?'

Man, I wish more people did this.  If someone said that, I would absolutely take the hint.  But most people say ""sure, sounds good!"" which is great, but all that tells me is they wouldn't mind spending time with me.

&gt;his disinclination to ask you

So long as it's actual disinclination!  Like I said earlier with the girl I worked with, I was just oblivious.  Apparently she was flirting with me and it went over my head (I'm way better about it now).  There was no disinclination, I was just an idiot.  Although...now that I think about it, there's pretty much no way to read that, and it's a much safer bet that the guy isn't interested.  May not be the case, but if I were in your shoes and the person wasn't flirting back, I don't think I'd pursue either.  I might try being a bit more forward, but if that does nothing, I'd give up.

LaMone,childfree,1389219181.0,"In the hypothetical situation that my brother had a kid, both he and his wife died, and both sets of grandparents were incapable of taking in the kid, and the foster/orphanage system in my country were a mess, I might adopt it. 

But adopting as in consciously and voluntarily deciding to become a parent? That is an admirable thing to do, but it is not for me."
