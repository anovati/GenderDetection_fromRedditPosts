CalvinDehaze,AskMen,1389567950.0,"You're kinda approaching this like a girl. When I'm talking to a girl, she shows her interest by touching me and laughing at my jokes. That's my que to ask for her number. At this point, I would just ask her to go on a date. ""So, what are you doing Friday night?"" If she says she has plans, say ""oh, well I wanted to take you out for some dinner and maybe a movie. How does Saturday look?"" If she has plans on Saturday, and doesn't offer another day, then she's probably not interested, but if she is then put the ball in her court. ""Alright, maybe one of these nights when you're free. Let me know"". THAT'S when you let her come to you.
  
Whatever you do, asking always works. Don't say ""hang out"" or plan anything with other friends. Make it very clear that it will be you and her only, in a date-like setting."

lamblikeawolf,short,1389567986.0,"There are a couple of directions I would like to respond to your comment with.

1. Do you think it is unreasonable for someone who has been told they are less because of a factor outside of their control to not have it get to them eventually? Like all repeated bullying, it adds up over time, and when internalized, becomes difficult to shake. **TL;DR - is their point of view entirely unreasonable considering the factors that led to their point of view?**

2. Telling someone with negative self-image issues that being more confident is the solution is like telling someone who is depressed that they just need to be more happy. It doesn't work that way. Internalized feelings of dissatisfaction with self require the help of professionals. (Also just like depression.) Sure, confidence may be part of it, but the person has to recognize that they are actually unhappy with themselves first. This is a difficult thing for people to realize without going full-tilt into depressive self-hatred, and looping themselves around into being mad at themselves for hating themselves so much. Especially when it is something they have heard a million times already, and have probably taken steps on their own to try? On top of the fact that people say ""have more confidence"" without really defining what confidence means or stating a more clear path of how to get there (which, to be honest, includes being comfortable with yourself) ? **TL;DR - Saying this to someone whose problem stems from a negative self-image is akin to telling a depressed person they just need to be happier and not dwell on the negatives.**"

keakealani,singing,1389568116.0,"Actually, starting much earlier than the 20s is often not terribly helpful for singers, as the voice doesn't finish maturing until the late 20s or early 30s for most singers. (So as a side note, it's not a given that your voice is, in fact, fully matured as you assert - if you are not well-trained, it's unlikely that you even have the capacity to know that at all.)  While getting a good foundation in the basics can be helpful for younger students, you're actually not at that much of a disadvantage as pretty much every voice student in their 20s will be working with a pretty new instrument that they probably don't have full control over anyway. 

Even so, I'd second a recommendation for a teacher, and much moreso than a cookie cutter exercise program. Each voice is unique and it's really important, especially in the beginning, to learn about your own voice and its quirks, something that a generic program can't offer as much as an experienced instructor. 

I would say that the other way to jump start any music instruction is to give yourself a strong basis in musicianship and music theory. If you don't already read music fluently, now is a good time to start, with especial emphasis on reading for singing. A good background in language is also important for singing - get some background in the phonetics of your native language as well as any language in which you plan to sing (for classical singers, that usually includes English, French, German, and Italian at a minimum). Of course, it's not necessary to be fluent in every language or have a doctorate in music theory, but I think those are the underemphasized fundamentals that can jump start a later beginner and close the gap of experience much more quickly.

I'm not saying put it all out there right away. But, this isn't akin to lying about your virginity or pretending to be more confident than you are or something like that. You have a strain HPV. Don't lie about that shit.

Even/especially if you had asymptomatic HPV, and even in the face of tons of people having some strain of HPV, if the situation comes up, be ready to tell the truth.

If she's got a level head and is at all educated on the subject (women who regularly visit a gynecologist, will know more about HPV than men), and she likes you, she will find a way to make it work with you.

It's a rough hand you've been dealt. I dunno the circumstances of you contracting it and don't wanna know. But, if you're gonna hide that from someone and be the reason they get HPV without them knowing, then we ought to give you the big middle finger.

I am thankful that my husband and I haven't been through what you went through. 

Since we met over 10 and a half years ago I've gained 40lbs and he has gained 70lbs. We had tried off and on to lose it but were content. 

Then we decided to get life insurance. Though we were both approved my blood work showed my glucose and lipoprotein being high. That if I didn't take care of it I could have some serious problems. 

My husband didn't have any issues. Though we both shared having low confidence and wanting to look good naked. 

Out of fear for my health we decided that it is time that we take care of ourselves because we want to live a long life. Like you and your ex we only have each other. I suppose that happens when hermit introverts meet. 

Just yesterday we weighed ourselves and I am down 7lbs and he is down 13lbs. We are proud of ourselves and each other. I asked him if he was struggling and he said ""I do have a sweet tooth but your health is more important. Plus I'm feeling a lot better about myself and this is right for me.""

We knew when we started this was not a diet because this change is not temporary. This is a lifestyle change. 

Well we both have more energy, can see the inches gone here and there, are more confident, and my husband is much hornier lol. 

Also I don't know if any other women has had this experience but I just had my period and I kept forgetting I had it because I wasn't cramping, moody, feeling fatigue, etc. I think the healthier food and exercise has something to do with that because usually I'm in the fetal position. "

Ralkir,changemyview,1389568185.0,"&gt;it seems like this contains many inferences that are not testable. What if that trait is one of the many we have that does not help us survive or reproduce, it just doesn't hurt. If we ascribe it with helping one of these things, we'd be wrong.

You're right we would be wrong. And THAT is the test. We test to see if it would help our survivability. Does the ability to design tools effect our survivability (big brain)? You bet. We can design weapons to defend ourselves and kill food sources, we can design clothes and shelter to protect us from the elements. The ability to feed ourselves and stay alive against the elements and threats improves our fitness.

Now back to testosterone. If you are a smaller and weaker human does the ability to recognize threats effect your survivability. You bet. If you can recognize threats you can act accordingly. Now if your big human does your lesser ability to detect threats help improve your survivability. Yes it does, it gives you the mental capacity to take advantage of your larger size to scare off potential threats without being scared yourself. This allows you to first survive to produce more offspring, and two protect your offspring to allow them to survive. 

I don't understand, what kind of test exactly are you looking for? You honestly are sounding like typical evolution critics ""Well where is the fossil of the transformation from this organism to another organism."""

&gt;Former GLBT therapist here, and this is what I came here to say. Gender dysphoria is pretty unique among mental health conditions in that it goes away when the person transitions. You have dysphoria, you transition, BOOM you don't have dysphoria anymore. For people who also undergo gender confirmation surgery, it's basically unheard of for them to have any regrets. This is in stark contrast to body dysmorphic disorder (being obsessively unhappy with a perceived flaw with your body); if someone gets plastic surgery because of BDD, they are usually NOT happy with the results.

&gt;That in itself is enough to tell me that transitioning genders really does fix the underlying problem. If we were just conceding to people's delusion that they're a different sex, we'd expect them to act like people with BDD after surgery. But instead, we see that transitioning cures their mental illness. That's pretty powerful."

Peeba_Mewchu,Aquariums,1389568547.0,"I have a baby albino spanish ribbed in a 20L tank (there's only 8-9 gallons of water though) with 8 white cloud minnows and I absolutely adore him. Spanish ribbed newts are easy to keep and breed but personally I would only put one other in my tank because they get pretty big compared to other newts out there. 

In a 15 gallon I would say you can get away with two at their full size. They need about 1/3 of the tank to be land but I depends on the newt. I've had some that prefer to stay on land and some that prefer to be in the water. 

Also, I would not put them with any fish that you don't want to see eaten or snapped at. Also ribbed newts don't really like the warm temperatures that gouramis require. I think the max water temp they can survive in is low 80s, I don't even have a heater in my tank. In addition, you're going to need a really secure lid on your tank. Newts are escape artists and any hole that they can get their head though, they will try to escape from. 

However, owning newts has been a great experience for me and I definitely recommend it. It's also fairly easy to breed them, which may be my next project. I'm on my phone right now but if you have any more questions pm me or check out caudata.org.

To maintain your position (positive proof that they were not there) you would have to place an unwarrantedly literal interpretation on certain areas of the document in a way which would be thrown out in most areas of historical discussion. Your interpretation arises from your implicit assumption that the document must be either wholly and literally correct, or entirely fictional. This is bad historical method, and worse logic.

And finally, to be clear: I do not know whether they were in Egypt. You do not know whether they were in Egypt. There is an absence of evidence: it is not possible to draw either conclusion."

sullyj3,SRSQuestions,1389568754.0,"&gt; the main assumption you're making here is that people who post in /r/shitredditsays[2] do that and only that. when i did, i was also frequently trying to discuss those same issues in a civil way with the people who got linked by srs, or just elsewhere on reddit. /r/shitredditsays[3] was my outlet to vent with likeminded people when i just got sick of arguing against brick walls.

Fair enough, I had meant to include something acknowledging that. I just wish that the result wasn't a lot of people getting the impression that SRS is full of man hating feminazis with no sense of humour.

However undeserved this reputation might be, I think that there's a reason SRS retains it, which is probably that SRSers don't bother doing much about it, simply because it's their space to vent, rather than to argue rationally. Fair enough.

The problem is that to many redditors, SRS is the face of feminism and social justice online. Its reputation may turn them off to bothering to care about these issues at all, which is obviously not desirable. It indirectly contributes to perpetuating oppression.

Once again, its ok for SRS to be used as a venting space. The end result is just shitty. I don't see an easy solution.

Except for number five (""they are established""), all of these behaviors are associated with traits that turn women off and display low sexual market value (as the PUA community would say).

Right now, you think what you two have is unique, ""you're one of a kind"". That is highly unlikely to be true and yet it is how everyone feels *at the beginning*. You might get together and you'll feel so happy and believe she won't ever cheat on you. What about later? When things are not so pink anymore, problems and insecurities start showing up? Then you might start thinking differently and knowing how you two started could possibly slowly eat up your brain.

If she would have broken up with her boyfriend the second something happened between you, then maybe you could give her the benefit of the doubt. As it is, I understand you feeling special and unique but this feeling will most likely fade with time. Not worth it, but it's your life and I can only wish you luck."

Also a lot of my favorite guests will never be on again because one of the cast has an issue or drama with one of them and because the cod community is starting to become smaller and bigger at the same time. What I mean is that new commentators join YouTube every day. But it seems that alot of the people in the community that were there when the podcast was first made aren't around anymore. And the people that are still around aren't as close I feel. A lot of them are a part of their own little cliques. Also I miss a lot of gaming talk. It seems like nobody on the podcast is on the same page when it comes to gaming. Lefty plays pc, wings plays cod, woody plays minecraft, and Kyle plays fallout or pretty much nothing.

The wealth will begin to in a few hands (mainly the job displacing technology owners), you can already see this beginning to happen. The jobless will either need a strong social safety net. or the government will end up directly run by those few wealthy people. Option 2 would lead to great poverty, and a strongly classed based society.

Option 3 is that the corporations can provide the social safety net out of their own good will without government interference (unlikely).

I think will be a mix of the top two options, with there being as small a safety net as possible without causing an extremely dissatisfied populace."

sporkmonger,rails,1389568902.0,"Easily the most common contract I did was billing systems. Billing systems make people nervous. A company usually only ever needs to build one billing system, which means that internal resources have probably never built one before and they are therefore a lot more likely to seek help from a contractor when implementing one. And unless they have no business model, almost everybody needs a billing system of some kind. These are actually my favorite type of contract. Liability insurance is not a bad idea if you start doing a lot of these; a single-person LLC may not be sufficient to protect you from liability. That probably sounds scary, but if you build them right, the risk is pretty low really. Always use a service like Stripe to build these. Always offload as much PCI compliance responsibility as you can to someone else. Never store credit cards in the client's database. Immediately fire any client that insists on storing credit cards themselves.

The second most common type of contract for me was mobile apps and/or backends for mobile apps. Similarly, not something that people have a lot of in-house talent required to build. It's rarely covered in university coursework so your average developer has no idea how to implement this, but there's a lot of demand for it.

The third most common request I got was some kind of backend data pipeline. While your average developer **thinks** they know how to build this, they invariably have never done it before and run into trouble quickly. There are a lot of complex gotchas and after you've got more than 2 or 3 workers, and especially once you've got multiple producers, scaling this stuff can get pretty hairy and people start thinking about bringing in a consultant for a bit to help sort things out.

However, from the perspective of a consultant, the type of project isn't as important as how long the project is going to take and how tolerant the client is going to be of keeping you on. You want to get a feel for how much of a budget the client has for your services ASAP. A one-week contract is worth it if your bank account is running on fumes, but otherwise, you may be better served turning down shorter term contracts at a higher rate in favor of a contract that negotiates a lower rate but a longer-term commitment.

Remember that you're being paid to know everything they don't. You **don't** have to actually know it yet. Always be confident in your abilities. Don't lie about what you do or do not know, but ""Sure, I can do that, no problem"" gets you a lot more contracts than ""I've never actually done that before, but I'll give it a go"". Just don't bill people for time spent learning how to do something they suspect you already know how to do. Billable hours are time spent building stuff, meeting with people, gathering requirements, etc. Learning is done on your own time. Budget for it. If you screw up something on your first rodeo and the client is upset, offer to make it right on your own dime.

Do everything you possibly can to avoid commuting anywhere. Any kind of commute is a waste of time and money when you're charging &gt;$1k/day. But don't turn down a good contract just because it's onsite.

And **always** leave negotiating room in your stated rates."

No, but this is how people justify the ridiculous spending in conversation.  ""We only spend the same amount, as a percentage of GDP as Russia, so it's not like we're *really* overspending"".  The point is that a measure of our military spending as a percentage of GDP is not the best indicator of whether or not we're spending too much.

&gt;Sure, a lot of areas in the military budget could be fine tuned, and fixed so it doesn't go to waste, but you're forgetting that the US military is massive, and has a lot of different sections that needs the money, from research, to weapons, to space technology etc..

It really is so much easier once you can look at it more objectively, which is probably the way all of your friends and family have been looking at the relationship the whole time. If you can talk to them, I'm sure they will have some wonderfully terrible things to say about your ex that will help you see the truth. They never liked/loved that person, so they never had the rose colored glasses that you did. If you're open to it, they can be a great help in moving on.

I hope things get better for you soon, and you find someone who isn't a shitty person."

Kelsig,Fallout,1389569556.0,"I don't recall mentioning platforms.

And I have that opinion because of several reasons

- Experience. My friends that prefer Fallout 3 are more casual

- The more casual the online community, the more Fallout 3 fans. For example, /r/gaming seems to like Fallout 3 a lot more than /r/games and /r/Fallout. /v/ hates Fallout 3 a lot, but loves New Vegas.

- Mechanics. Fallout 3's combat was entirely small guns and energy weapons based, which makes sense if you don't plan on your fanbase repeatedly playing the game. New Vegas also added things like Reloading Benches, and tons of complex recipes. Hardcore mode. Several main quest branches. Fallout 3 was much more linear, which isn't an issue unless your players want a new experience.

- New Vegas does stay more to the roots of the originals, which Fallout 3 does not in the slightest. I don't believe a single casual played F1 and F2, therefore leaving them out in terms of atmosphere."

I try to do my business in the open. When I've offered on items (like some evil coconuts), I made my offers in comments that were visible to everyone. If someone wants to do business entirely on direct messages instead of where others can see the price of something they're selling you or the amount of neopoints they're willing to pay you for an item, I'd be wary.

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389569963.0,"&gt; ith UBI, only a few of those people would continue to need the money

You overestimate the power of UBI.

Look, UBI is probably only gonna offer as much as minimum wage, and as we know, a lot of people making minimum wage need to be on food stamps and crap to make ends meet. To truly have a ""living wage"", you'll need to work AND have UBI. The min wage will still have a purpose after UBI is put in place. There will just be less pressure to raise it.

&gt;Wages will increase by necessity, as otherwise companies won't be able to hire people.

Considering how many people work multiple jobs, I disagree. Also, if wages will increase, what's the problem? That will only make min wage superfluous.

&gt; What minimum wage laws do in this case is hurt people who WANT to work for small amounts of money - people who, with minimum wage laws in place - would probably end up working for free instead (e.g. as an unpaid intern) because it's just what they want to do.

No, corporate greed hurts people. I don't think someone making millions of dollars cares if he has to pay $5 or $7 an hour...the profit margins are so high it's irrelevant. Moreover, since I assume universal healthcare and elimination of payroll taxes in my own plans, employers will already get cut a break paying benefits.

&gt; UBI is popularly seen as very left-wing policy but it's also actually a step towards a more effective free market in labor, and having elimination of minimum wage in there helps to convey this point.

I don't care. It will hurt people.

&gt;UBI is an extremely good policy idea and deserves to have support from fiscal liberals and conservatives both, and to not be made into a partisan issue.

Please...the idea of giving people free money makes them see red. I don't think eliminating the wage will assuage that. Also, minimum wage not only affects those making it, but those making above it. It affects the whole wage structure. If you get rid of it, there's really no reason why employers cant cut middle class wages....after all, since the min wage guys cut their wages, there's no incentive to pay more than those kinds of jobs any more."

Were his parents really devout and forced him into it? Was he a drunk/deadbeat who wanted to turn his life around? I also give them long term goals. Goals that go beyond the next adventure or defeating the BBEG. Does the cleric want to have is own parish, rid the world of evil (or good), or scam the religious folks who listen to him out of mountains of gold? 

All of those details should help shape how you play your character. The orphan who wants his own flock is going to react way different than the one forced into it and wants to scam innocent folks when he sees a homeless child begging for money in the street. "

By starting the conversation this way you have already blamed short women for slights they may not have committed.

If you were to ask me the average height of the men I have dated, and if I were to tell you that they were taller than me, but that I largely consider other factors, I feel that I would already be put into your box of ""not doing anything about it."" And had my response been that two would be considered tall and one average, but that it really had to do more with personality and other life factors, I feel like I would be even more squarely placed into your box of blame.

If you were instead to ask me how many men I dated that were shorter than me, and I were to tell you that I never knew and have never met men shorter than me, I feel you would call me a liar because of the number of short men on this subreddit.

ArcherofArchet,AdviceAnimals,1389570479.0,"This is bad, bad advice.

You should, by all means, NOT spend that much time on your job search.  If you truly spend 8 hours a day looking for a job, you're doing it wrong.  It's generally not good to ""spam"" the market.  Don't apply for anything and everything that comes your way - apply for jobs you really want, you think you will do well at, and that you are qualified for.

If you have an advanced degree, apply for jobs in your field.  If you have experience, look for jobs where it would be applicable.  Write a good resume.  Scrap the ""Objective"" or ""Summary"" or ""Career Goal,"" don't put your Social Security Number or your references on it, keep it to one page, and make it shine.  If you have jobs you would rather not list, by all means, *skip them.*  If you're applying for a professional job, nobody is interested in how long you cashiered at Target during college.

Write a killer cover letter.  Do not, please, *do not* start it with ""Enclosed please find my resume"" - they know it will be there.  Write about things that are not in your resume.  Things like how you enjoy marathons, because they challenge you to keep going.  Or that you were a stay-at-home dad for the last three years, so your wife could fulfill her career dreams.  Or that you wrote a novel that you self-published.  Or whatever else you think will make the employer interested in you, or make you stand out.  Don't waste money on ""resume paper"" and first-class mailing; most employers will want your stuff by e-mail anyway.

Don't sit on your ass and just job-search.  Go take a class relevant to your field.  Volunteer somewhere - at a charity, in your own field, at the dog shelter, whatever.  Make connections.  Network.  Reach out to people you have worked with, went to school with, go to church with, see at the dog park every morning.  Strike up a conversation, but don't force the ""give me a job lead"" thing.  It will come up naturally on the ""oh, and what do you do for a living?"" question.

Stay on track.  Stay organized.  Ace the interview.  Dress nice, speak clearly, and be prepared for any question.  Be honest; if you got fired, they will call your former boss and find out anyway, so soften the blow by telling when they ask.  Don't get defensive, and *never,* let me repeat this, **never** badmouth a former employer.  Be enthusiastic about the opportunity.  Don't play coy when they ask about your salary ideas, and don't give vague figures.  If you say ""Oh, in the forties or fifties"" - to you, it may mean 45k and up, to them it means 41k.  Be specific: 45k-55k, or whatever your range is.

Oh, and while you're doing this...  let yourself enjoy this for a moment or two.  Make breakfast for your spouse, or spend some time with your kids.  Obviously, I'm not saying lounge around in your PJs all day, but don't feel bad for getting a little more me-time.

Good luck."

Ralkir,changemyview,1389570573.0,"&gt; I guess I'm looking for a little complexity. I read a book about evolution a few months ago and it seemed really complicated. Like, X and Y chromosomes evolving to antagonize each other (and this ends up not killing us, so it stays, even though it does not at all seem like the best thing for our overall organism) I probably put that wrong. Like I said, I'm no scientist. But evo-psych seems to throw up all of these straight arrows and it's a red flag for me.

That's the thing though, evolution at it's core is EXTREMELY simple. Evolution is the idea that we evolve over time, traits that allow us to survive better in our environment. Now why is this? Well it's simple, if you're dead then you can't pass on your genes, but if you survive then you can pass on your genes. So the genes that make us survive are the one's that get passed on.

What you're looking at with X and Y is an explanation, same as I have been giving you but about a different topic, not evolution. Evolution didn't evolve X and Y genes. Simply put, the dichotomy of X and Y genes increased the ability for organisms to survive, so they then passed on their genes. Evolution just picks out what works, not what is best. "

mike5f4,short,1389570773.0,"Let me start by saying that I am 54 yo and have had many, many, girlfriends, two wives (one past away). Fighting this stigma is something got involved with recently due to the amount of heightism I saw happening in the 15 or so years. It wasn't until then that I even knew that women where suppose to not like short men. It was a more recent phenomena that I began seeing in the culture in the very late 1990s as the comedians and shock jocks started their comical rants saying these things. This is a stigma that was created more than was a problem at the time. The reason you see o much of this negativity today is because young women where fed this idea from an early age in our culture through television and movies. That is why you see this attitude MUCH more so in women under 35 yo. I'm not blaming, I'm trying to change this. If you have been around here or look at my submitted posts and comments, than you would know that I stick up for the women on this sub more than any other man here.

As for standing up for smaller people, lets just say that I was a body builder for many year going back to 14 yo. I have been known to knock a few bullies on their ass when I have seen abuse.

Please try and get over this idea of accusing and see the problem as it is and help fight it as you say you have done in the past. That is all I ask."

In a casual setting, you can abuse it to keep your opponents off a certain color against multi color decks.  Also, remember to search for destroy and exile permanents as well.

A final point is that your opponent is probably running 24 ish lands.  Chances are, they are going to find way more lands than you find ways to destroy them, though you will probably stop them from hitting 6 mana or so.

He needed a lot more help than an online forum could ever give him. 

I mostly agree with this.  Too many people prioritize love and sex to a level at which it defines who they are as a person. That's unhealthy, but it is very prevalent in this subreddit and in reddit broadly.  

BUT

If someone is to the point that they are willing to end it all, then maybe we should at least humor that person.

**Fortune's Pawn** by Rachel Bach: this turned out to be *awesome*. I thought it'd be a bit of loveable rubbish - but it turned out to have substance! Really can't wait for the next in the series.

**Doll Bones** by Holly Black: also an ARC that I just got around to over the weekend. A middle grade novel that was sweet and full of magic. A bit simple, but hey ho. Light.

I've just started **The Girl with All the Gifts** by M.R. Carey. I am SO happy to have gotten an ARC of this because I was so excited for it! Comes out Jan 14th in the UK, but not until June in the US. Started out well...zombies from a child's POV. One I finish my audiobook of **Rivers of London**, which has taken me ages, I'll be moving on to **Alice's Adventures in Wonderland** on audio.

Besides that, I'm also beta reading a novella for Brian McClellan for Tuesday.

My new review blog can be found [here, called Robot Witch](http://www.robotwitch.com)! It has a review up at the moment of Ancillary Justice, Red Rising and Fortune's Pawn. A review of mini review post will go up on Tuesday with Doll Bones, Rivers of London (which I WILL finish this week if it kills me) and A Monster Calls, plus a giveaway! Friday will see a review of The Girl with All the Gifts (currently running a Tuesday, Friday &amp; Sunday schedule while I can keep up).

Well excited to get my blog up, and would appreciate feedback of my review style - I'm still learning!"

sullyj3,SRSQuestions,1389570926.0,"&gt; Perhaps marginalized groups don't care what you think is in their best interest because you act like you have any idea what is in their best interest without having experienced any of the situations that cause so many problems up to and including murder. You are already aware of this lack of perspective.

~~Tell me if I'm wrong, but what I'm getting from this is ""your opinion that less oppression of minorities would be a good thing is wrong because you've never been part of an oppressed minority"". It doesn't really make sense to me.~~  
EDIT: Having read the rest of your post, I think I misinterpreted you, and I'm therefore rescinding that last paragraph.

&gt; This has everything to do with the comfort of bigoted individuals, because you believe that ultimately, these people are totally reasonable and rational individuals whose only flaw and source of aggression and discrimination is that their views haven't been countered in a manner equivalent to their preferred method of discourse.

That's a very interesting point. It's true that most people with bigoted views, are unreasonable assholes who are impossible to argue with. However, I'm sure some (a very small fraction) of rascist/sexist/what-have-you-ist people would respond positively to reasonable arguments. I'm talking about the people with shitty views that are less obviously ridiculous and more superficially reasonable than the examples you provided.

I think it's a matter of pragmatism. The goal is to reduce the number of bigots in the world. I believe that engaging people in reasonable, non-hostile discourse, is the method which will convert the most bigots, even it only converts a relatively small fraction of bigoted people. 

&gt; If you want a person belonging to a marginalized group to feel more comfortable, here is a suggestion. Perhaps instead of making them feel like their method of expression and their response to the discrimination they feel on a daily basis is harmful to themselves and damages the goals of the movement at large, why don't you stand with them and scream at all the hate in the world as well so that they can feel like their struggle is normal, acceptable, and evidence of a progress in a modern society?

Sure, those who are oppressed should feel validated and righteous in their rage against the sea of bullshit that is bigotry. I accept that people need a space to vent, because you can't keep constantly dealing normally with this shit every day without getting absolutely sick of it. But at the same time, I feel like raging against oppression is short term gain at the expense of long term improvement in the worlds net amount of shittiness. When you say ""don't think that asking marginalized groups to be less angry is anything but in the service of the status quo"" I think you are setting up a false dichotomy between silence and rage. I'm advocating for arguing in a manner most likely to change peoples' opinion, *in addition to* absolutely valid venting of frustration.

&gt; But your opinion contains a lot of proscriptive critiques and claims about normative behavior that marginalized people would be better off were they to adopt them. That is problematic and hurtful to anyone that has been brave enough to vocalize their anger in a public forum.

I apologise that my opinion came off this way. I'll have to think more on this. I don't mean to diminish or invalidate people's right to expressing their frustration, as I've said, I'm advocating trying more constructive methods as well.

It's a shitty situation all around. Thanks very much for your reply."

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1389571116.0,"Those are general titles for people behaving poorly. Gamer girls imply that someone is female, and looking for sexual attention from men to get ahead in gaming. Implying that gamer girls are not gamers, but people that cheat at games. It's a kind of ""has tits, doesn't count"" way of invalidating your prowess at games, or the entire reason why you game. Not because it's fun, but because you're a whore and you want attention from men.

Now, is there a title for men who play games and give women attention solely because they're women? A specific title for them, especially for gaming, that invalidates their gaming experience and motivations. Right, there isn't.

Yeah, so my beef with the title is that it implies that the problem with the ""gamer girl"" phenomenon is the following. It's a scant amount of women who have monetized or incentivized their sexuality for a gaming audience. Exponentially more people give those women attention. This is obvious, because nobody's going to go through the trouble of becoming a cam girl on Twitch if there wasn't a ready and willing audience of more than one. Which implies that there's more than one person giving each one ""gamer girl"" attention.

So the problem is actually people who give girls sexual attention in games. Which is also manifest by the amount of women who don't want sexual attention in games, get it anyway, and then complain about it. Loudly, in drama-filled threads (because that's how those sorts of things go). So not only is the ratio of attention-givers to attention-getters more than one-to-one, there's *so many* of them that a lot misfire and target anyone who they feel fits a stereotype of the ""gamer girl.""

Which some people actually think is all women who play video games. Or just all women in general, because some people believe that all women want male attention all the time.

I don't have a problem with women who have incentivized or monetized gaming activities. It's not exactly an easy gig. But just because we share genitalia doesn't mean someone on the other end of a mic gets to assume that I want to talk dirty or that I'm shit at gaming like they supposedly are.

Those women are not responsible for people misfiring and harassing people that don't want attention. The people who assume that all women who play video games are ""gamer girls"" are responsible for that. And there's more of them than there's actual gamer girls, which is a problem that a lack of terminology for those creeps doesn't help."
LinguistHere,Pennsylvania,1389571116.0,"They're separate issues. Under full legalization, a separate push for ""medical marijuana"" is obviously unnecessary. The point of campaigns for medical marijuana is to fight against social conservatives who are willing to hold seriously ill people hostage in order to make a point of social policy.

And regarding the argument that it's just about having ""getting stoned made legal,"" well, it *practically already is* if you're white and middle-class. For the most part, it's minority populations who get the serious legal penalties, far out of proportion to the actual level of drug use. From a social justice perspective, ending the drug war isn't about wanting to sit around and get stoned; it's a fight to dismantle a broken and racist legal mechanism that disproportionately wrecks the lives of the most vulnerable.

Look: I've never used any illegal drug, but I'm a well-educated white man with a father who is a politically-active lawyer. If I did get charged with possession of a drug, you can damn well be sure it wouldn't have any serious lasting impact on my life. So for as long as the same offense would destroy the life of someone who has less social clout, I have a damn good reason to fight against the drug war, even if I'm not just ""getting stoned."""

**No contact. Period.**

You can never, ever, EVER speak to this girl again. Even if it's to tell her to leave you alone: you cannot send her any kind of message ever again. If she sends you one, you either delete it immediately or you tell your SO. No ifs, ands, or buts. ""Good friend"" or not, you crossed a line. You are not a victim here, and if you want to keep your relationship with your SO, you need to completely cut contact with this ""friend."" Delete from facebook, erase her phone number, everything. If you have any messages or emails saved, delete those too. As far as you're concerned, this woman does not exist and never existed in the first place.

And transparency. She's going to be looking over your shoulder for a long time. If you want her to trust you again, you need to be patient and understanding. She gave you her trust, and you used it to cheat and lie. Understand that every time you take your phone with you into the bathroom or answer a late night text, she's going to be thinking that it's this girl. *But I deleted her number! Shouldn't she trust me?* No, because you lied the first time. Trust is earned, and it's not the kind of thing you can flip a switch over once you've been betrayed. I'm not suspicious of my partner texting now, but I still distrust any ""good friend"" female friend of his that I conveniently haven't met in person. From here on out, 100% transparency.

I didn't fault him for this, but we also never went back to his place because my place was *so* much more comfortable for two people to share. If you keep your apartment in its current state, it's not just non-date-friendly, it implies that you never invite other people into your home at all, which is weird.

However unfortunately I don't think that ""being right"" has merit when it comes to a relationship conflict...what matters is who is feeling what and what can be done to make feelings...feel better. I know I've at least once felt a little hurt in a past relationship because my siggo masturbated instead of having sex with me, but gosh did we have bigger problems!

I think her speaking of it being cheating and suggesting that you'd happily cheat is a cheap shot, unnecessary, and is purely her lashing out. I think you should communicate how much that hurts you and how unfair you feel it is (but again, focus on how actions/words make you FEEL, not about whether they are right or wrong).

I think that if you want to continue this relationship and restore harmony the focus should be communicating and making each other feel better and healing the wounds on both sides caused by this upset. I wouldn't focus as much on what actually happened, or whether you're ""allowed"" to masturbate without making her feel upset (because quite frankly I think even debating that is sillllyyy...her feelings have merit but they don't override that masturbating is healthy and has nothing to do with her)."

TeHokioi,newzealand,1389571429.0,"I might be a bit biased, given that I'm from Christchurch, but I would still recommend stopping in, at least from Christchurch north. If you wanted to skip Dunedin, you could go from Queenstown through to Cromwell and then up the middle of the island, stopping off at Mount Cook and Lake Tekapo:

http://goo.gl/maps/lukNX

The detour to Mt Cook township is probably a couple hours, so I wouldn't recommend it if you were wanting to go from Queenstown to Christchurch in a day. But there is a (reasonably) fancy hotel in Mt Cook township, and a lot of more affordable places in Tekapo. Tekapo also has the Mount John Observatory, which you can go up to in the day for the view or take a guided tour at night if the weather is good for stargazing

Going this route means you only have ~2 hours at most instead of ~5 on the fairly boring Canterbury plains, so that could be more favourable. 

Christchurch itself has some cool stuff going on at the moment - the Re:Start container mall and numerous 'Gap Filler' projects make the most of the demolition work done in the city, and give Christchurch a unique feel. Recently, the Oi You festival has resulted in a lot of walls around the city featuring awesome street art (There's an app you can get on a smart phone to locate these murals)

Further up, Kaikoura has a lot of wildlife expeditions, and you can go on whale watching tours or just stop on the side of the road (where safe) and see lots of seals. Ohau stream is just north of Kaikoura itself, where after about a 10 minute bush walk you arrive at a waterfall pool where baby seals live during some months (I think it's winter, but you'd need to double check). Worth a visit if it's the right time of year, sometimes there are dozens of seal pups there. 

If you like the occasional alcoholic beverage, Blenheim and the surrounding areas are home to a lot of renowned vineyards, many of which have public tasting rooms (the same goes for the Kawarau gorge, between Queenstown and Cromwell). All in all, I'd say that the majority of the East Coast is worth a stop, it's just the southern half that is flat and boring

One other thing I would suggest is to make sure you visit Arrowtown, just outside of Queenstown. I went there every year when I was a kid, and love it there. Looks great all year around, it's an old mining town that is still going strong (unlike most of the other ones)"

mahthrahawah,AskMen,1389571679.0,"It wasn't worth it. I was the one who did it, yet it made me lose all trust in her. If it was so easy for me to get away with it, so could she right? Every time she went out with her friends, or went somewhere I thought she was trying to hide something from me. The only way our relationship lasted for years after that was that I kept the crazy inside. I didn't get into arguments with her over it. 

We were each other's firsts, and had been dating for 2 years or so. We were ready to ""spend the rest of our life together"" but she was telling me all the things she was never willing to do. I had a friend who I talked to off and on for years and she'd always try to get me to go out with her. I'd vent my frustrations and she would just laugh and say that she'd love to do those things to/for me. I started hanging out with her, just trying to enjoy the feeling of desire. Of course I had that feeling in the back of my mind of what could happen. So one night we went to the mall to catch up and had a good time, and when it was time to drop her off we made out in her car. That's all that happened that night, but I wanted it. So the next time we hung out, which was only a few days later, she ended up blowing me in my car and swallowed - that was one thing my gf said she'd never do. The next night we got a hotel room together and had sex. She was into it and had so much enthusiasm that I wasn't used to. It was mind blowing. After a few hours it dawned on me what I had done, and I felt disgusted with myself. I took a shower we went to bed after. How could I do this to someone? 

Even with the crazy inside of me I tried to correct my conscience by being a better person and bf to her. She never found out, and still does not know. Current circumstances its pretty obvious, but I'm not going to go into that due to the details being too specific.

I regret it; its not worth it."

I wrote off two of my family members. My mother and my uncle are the two who i noticed made the biggest negative impact in my life. 

My uncle is extremely manipulative and will take advantage of you and stab you in the back any chance he has. Hes a deadbeat with no education or a job and treats everyone in his family including myself like shit when all we do is try to help him. 

My mother is a habitual liar and just as manipulative as my uncle. She raised me to hate most of my family including my father for almost half my life until i started to learn and think for myself.

I was severely depressed being around them and i'm still struggling with it but when i cut them out I immediately noticed improvements in my life. I'm going back to school soon (I dropped out at 9th). I plan on learning culinary as well as computer IT and my grandfather is teaching me mechanics though that profession is kinda boring to me. lol.

Unfortunately i felt bad for the two of them so i let them both into my life again because they both begged for me to see and speak to them again. I did make it clear to them i will cut them out again if they ever do something wrong though."

Finalpotato,AdviceAnimals,1389571718.0,"OK can everyone just calm down for a second. Society routinely co-ops medical terms to become common terms of speech there is no need to get worked up about it. If we are going to attack people for saying OCD because it is a medical term, here are a few other 'medical terms' we should be 'attacking' people over:

* moron - person with a mental age between 8 and 12
* imbecile - person with a mental age between 3 and 7
* idiot - person with a mental age below 3, struggles with speech intensely
* lame - having a limb/s crippled or otherwise unable to function
* dumb - an inability to speak
* retarded - affected with mental retardation
* spaz - someone affected with cerebral palsy
* anal retentive - what people used to say rather than OCD, medically it means constipated
* crazy/insane - medically insane, applies to a range of conditions all of which tend to require help from a professional .

When people use these words in slang they aren't using them in the medical sense, despite that being what they were originally intended for. So why should we say some of these terms are ok to say but OCD isn't? Just because we noticed it happening? Language is constantly evolving and these people are merely exaggerating for effect, leave them alone.

With persons seeking sex/gender reassignment, they know what they have early on and they know how to fix it. Calling it a mental illness does nothing beneficial.

Traunt,OkCupid,1389572040.0,"Hiya!

Overall, your profile looks great! Two things I did notice though:

1) I'd probably slim down your favorites list, a little too long imo. Just had to do that myself in fact. 

2) Every profile I'e seen that has said ""don't message me dick pics or sexually harass me."" I've always thought, the guys that do that probably don't care and will still insult you or do whatever, regardless if you tell them not to. I always found it puts a kind of negative tone to the profile for actual decent guys by mentioning it. They'll do it whether you mention it or not, because they either won't care or won't even read down that far.

3) Somebody else said to switch your main profile picture to the ocean one. I agree with them! :)

woofiegrrl,JapanTravel,1389572175.0,"I have taken the Hokutosei and loved it. I cannot speak to the Twilight Express. I also cannot help with the JR Pass aspect, as a resident it wasn't an option to me when I did this. 

Note that to get a private room (""Solo"") you should reserve *as soon as possible* when it's available for your date. I took the Hokutosei for the Sapporo Snow Festival, and showed up at the ticket desk a few hours after it opened that day. The solos were already sold out and I had to get a B-Shindai. After just a few hours of tickets being available! 

Now, the Snow Festival is obviously the most popular time to go to Sapporo - but I still say you should get it ASAP if you want a private room. If you end up in a B-Shindai, I recommend the lower berth. It was really quite private with the curtain pulled, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Do get dinner in the club car, it's expensive but a fun experience (I did the non-reserved). 

I would suggest working out with someone in Japan to call or visit to make the reservation for you. Remember you've got to do it as soon as tickets become available. Hopefully someone can do it for you. 

I really loved my experience on the Hokutosei. Let us know how you like it! 

Edit: The Hokutosei does use non-JR track at one point. There will be a charge for that. 

Edit 2: [This thread](http://www.japan-guide.com/forum/quereadisplay.html?1+72225) reinforces the importance of timing your booking carefully. I suspect they wanted something private as it was their honeymoon, and didn't consider b-shindai. But even the travel agent they used in Japan missed the timing! "

I'm not sure if you can receive any of this from him. I think it doesn't hurt to *ask*. If I were in your situation, I would say something along these lines:

""I have been affected negatively through your carelessness. I loved you and I trusted you. I understand that your intention was not malicious, but you *have* damaged me. I would like you to acknowledge that and to give me an apology. Can you do that?""

2. The bot friends that bot and updates the flair to ""banned""
3. The bot checks what subs it's modded in
4. The bot checks its /r/friends/comments for those subs

mkvgtired,business,1389572661.0,"I like how AT&amp;T feels confident enough to speak for Verizon. 

My parents moved to the middle of nowhere. My brother is also down there. I used to have Verizon. Yes, it is expensive, but its network is by far the most complete. If you go off the beaten path, Verizon will be the most likely to work, followed by AT&amp;T, followed by other carriers. 

My brothers closest neighbor is probably half a mile away, the next is over one mile. He is definitely in the middle of nowhere, surrounded completely by fields and woods. I did a speed test on Verizon's LTE network in his driveway, and got 26 Mbps download speed. AT&amp;T is the only other carrier that works at all down there, and it works very poorly. Him and my dad own a business and Verizon is the only carrier with comprehensive enough coverage. 

I was also hiking part of the Appalachian trail. I was able to make a phone call on the top of one of the mountains. Another hiker saw me and asked if he could use my phone. He was unable to make a call ""for a couple weeks."" I only had one bar, but it made my call and his without dropping either. 

I would love to have T-Mobile as an option, but it has no coverage when I go to my parents house. It works great in Chicago where I live, but I hate not having a phone down there. 

**TL;DR: I left Verizon because it was so expensive, but I can see why they charge a premium. Their network has by far the best nationwide coverage. They were the most aggressive in upgrading their entire network to LTE, so even rural customers can take advantage of high-speed data.**"

Demanding money from a school like that would shut the place down fairly quickly. If I ask for pay, they'd have to pay everybody. The owner wouldn't put up with that and the school would shut down. That would directly affect the talent pool. Which in turn, would help deteriorate indy wrestling.

I DID need a tune up to get back into it. I've been out of wrestling for years due to some family issues.

Not to mention that through WWA4, I was able to earn a bunch of paid indy gigs and may have already landed a paid indy gig through that very show in the pic.

This show was a favor for a building that I help build the history of. There wasn't a ref that was bumped due to me price cutting. THAT'S what they want to prevent when they teach you to not ref/work for free or cheap.

everhood13,ClotSurvivors,1389572847.0,"Hey, sorry it took me so long to reply. I didn't see this right away because you apparently didn't reply to my comment? Any way. The mental issues surrounding PE are strange for many people. It has been nearly a year for me, and I still think about my PE often and am reminded about that day by all kind of things. It is easy to become paranoid about clotting and the changes your body goes through when you get off of birth control.

I'm surprised they didn't test you for a clotting disorder. The standard seems to be to run genetic tests, and give blood thinners for six months if no genetic conditions are found. Coumadin is a hell of a drug, and many people here are on it. I wish you luck with your medication! Be careful, and don't cut yourself!

Are you wearing compression stockings? Talk to your doctor first, but the usual course of action is to wear compression stockings for up to two years after your DVT. I was told I didn't need to wear compression stockings and that my clots probably wouldn't scar, but they did. I still have pain in my left leg as a result. You should be getting a second CT in about 6 months to see if you have any more clots.

I'm glad you have good support in your husband. It is so nice to have someone close to watch you. Without my husband, I wouldn't be here. I literally owe him my life. Rely on each other. He may get a bit paranoid in the end. My husband did, and even had a panic attack because he wondered if he was having a DVT one night. 

Lastly, enjoy that puppy! A puppy can do wonders for helping you heal spiritually/mentally. Coming home from to hospital to my puppies was so wonderful, and gave me motivation to get up and about every day. I wish your family the best!  "
thrawn21,Minecraft,1389572852.0,"This is honestly one of the better maps I've seen here, you've got some *really* great coastline shapes here, which is not something you commonly see. I used to love building wp maps myself (been meaning to get back into it) and my biggest tip would be to make yourself some custom brushes. It's fairly simple, and gives you a world of variety for texture in your landscapes. 

For example, right now the north eastern ice, the south eastern river delta and the coast of your central landmass all appear to share the same default ""crackle"" brush. It's a smaller detail to give your marshes, ice floes and deltas different land textures, but in my opinion it makes a big difference. To give an example, [here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/eKYKG9O.jpg) of the last big map I made. It's not the final version (and I did quite a bit more tweaking by hand in-game), but it gives you a idea of what custom textures can do. There's a fair few quite obvious ones in there, but there's also a lot more that are more subtle, and I can go into detail where and what each one were if you'd like. 

I don't know if you've gotten into adding foliage yet, but another thing I would suggest is creating custom flora using a [Better BOB](http://faskerstudio.com/minecraft/BBOB/) creator and custom surface material brushes in wp. That's what the colorful splotches are in the picture above, and [here](http://redditpublic.com/carto/pve/current/#/-70/64/-272/-3/0/0) is an example of some giant mushrooms I made in-game (that map contains a bunch of different custom plants, but the mushrooms are the most obvious (and that map is also after my server built on it, wish I had a pre-rev clean version)). 

I don't know what balance between fantasy and realistic you're aiming for, but in my maps I tend to go fairly fantastical, but I go through quite a bit of trouble to ensure they have very realistic water systems, as I feel that that adds a kind of believability to them. In that map above, each of my rivers have origins in mountainous areas, with two of them coming from glacier melt (it's not as obvious in the picture because all of the higher elevation water had to be hand placed, due to the restrictions in wp). For you I would suggest you have a look at your north eastern river system, as the northernmost tributaries are nice, but then it doesn't really have a logical flow to your two deltas. Not saying you *have* to change it, just my personal preference and suggestion.

One last thing would be to consider your target playerbase when making a map. My server is really fond of large sprawling cities, so they like easier flat areas to build in. To cater to that (while still keeping the map interesting), I made sure that most all of my mountains were composed of relatively horizontal portions, or failing that, situated near a decent plain. If you plan for this to be used by the general public, I'd *strongly* suggest adding more sources of sand than the one concentrated desert you have now, as I've found that a) players don't typically like to have to travel far to acquire glass, and b) that singular desert is guaranteed to be heavily mined [like this one was](http://redditpublic.com/carto/pve/current/#/-498/64/-874/-4/0/0) on my map. If you don't want to add another desert, your best bet is to give your coast some fat beaches. 

There's other little nitty-gritty details I can help with if you'd like, but hopefully some of this wall of text will help you out! :D"

I learned a lot about myself and I came to a really good place with my sense of self and my spiritual development, but hash oil was nothing but pain and misery every time I did it.  I only tried it a handful of times but that was enough for me to know that hash oil and I simply don't mix, it's just too much THC for my system, it's too easy for me to get caught up in negative or paranoid thoughts, thoughts that hash oil amplified to incredible lengths.  It was a few hours in hell, basically, and other, 'stronger' drugs like LSD or psilocybin mushrooms have even during my worst experiences given me some kind of lesson, something to bring back with me (not that they turn bad on me with any kind of regularity, but it's happened once or twice).

Or they're 14 and they have literally no idea what hornet's nest they've poked. I'm in my mid-20s, so I have a really good idea of what it means to announce yourself as female in sausage fest: everyone thinks you want attention. I was once 14, and stupid, and did it, and was unprepared for the amount of shitty attention it got me. For something as mundane as mentioning my gender.

Or they could be trying to prove that girls game to the people that attest that women aren't into video gaming.

It's really damned if you do, damned if you don't. Funny thing, we don't hold men to these standards of gaming.

But sure, 100% of girls that announce their gender are actually whores that want stuff and sexual attention from men. Repeat that to yourself a couple of times, and ask yourself, what assumptions are you making about the nature and motivations of women? None of them are complimentary.

&gt;The fact that we are arguing over this being an issue only with gaming is part of what makes it an issue in the gaming community.

If you're relying on Module A's template, you aren't *really* a separate module in any meaningful sense of the word.  But...yes, you can easily do that in the Knockout example, if that floats your boat (I imagine Angular would be just as easy, but I don't know it as well).

    // Template from Module A
    &lt;div&gt;You've clicked &lt;span data-bind='text: clickCounter.numberOfClicks'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; times&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;button data-bind='click: function() {clickCounter.registerClick(); stupid.alertOnClick();}'&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

    // Code from Module A
    var ClickCounterViewModel = function() {
        this.numberOfClicks = ko.observable(0);

        this.registerClick = function() {
            _this = this;
            _this.numberOfClicks(_this.numberOfClicks() + 1);
        };
    };

    // Code from Module B
    var StupidViewModel = function() {
        this.alertOnClick = function() {
            alert(""Why am I doing this?"");    
        }
    }

    // Entry point
    MetaViewModel = {
        clickCounter: new ClickCounterViewModel(),
        stupid:new StupidViewModel()
    }

    ko.applyBindings(MetaViewModel);

If you don't like the clunky click binding, you can do various clever things with custom bindings, or using an event bus, or a bunch of other things.  Indeed, if it's important to you that this use case work well, and you don't want to have to modify the template at all, you could use [Unobtrusive event binding](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/unobtrusive-event-handling.html).  (Although again, I would argue that this is actually bad: Module B now has a dependency on, of all things, the STYLING of Module A's template.  Change Module A's class and you break Module B, and there's absolutely no way you can tell this by looking just at Module A; you potentially have to look at every module in your code base to try and see if anything happens to be binding on that selector.  Explicitly referencing Module B in Module A's template doesn't *ADD* a dependency, it makes an existing dependency explicit, which is very, very good.)

In short:  You can do what you're discussing in *both* design patterns, but you really shouldn't.  Writing your code to be harder to understand *SO* that you can easily do fragile, hard to understand things is not wise."

Buy a shampoo and conditioner that is sulfate and paraben free. Even a womens shampoo, nothing wrong with that. Also you could do a coconut oil treatment once every couple weeks to soften your hair out and take away some of that frizzyness. 

For face stuff, you want to do a gentle cleanse once a day (or every other day if your skin isn't problem skin). Stay away from stuff with citrus and none of that apricot scrub stuff. Also use a clean washcloth to exfoliate, much better for your skin than products with exfoliating beads. I personally use sunscreen as a moisturizer so it has a double use for me - moisturizes and protects from the sun. You'd be surprised at how much the sun can age and damage skin.

And the first thing I thought of that would counter that kind of statement had to do with dating.

That is an excellent point, and one I will certainly take to heart.

I don't disagree with this.  A lot of PUA tactics are not good for securing long term relationships.  But, most women who are at the ""peak of their desirability"" (to be crass about it) aren't looking for long term relationships either.  So these ""beta"" tactics are good for finding a woman who is ready for long term relationships - after her looks have faded and she has already been ""used up"" (again, to be crass about it) by other men during short term flings.

So OP goes and buys a TDS meter, runs his water, and finds that his TDS is about 300 mg/L.  Now he knows that there are 300 mg/L of impurities in his water.  But 300 mg/L *of what*?  Trace minerals that are perfectly safe to drink?  Or lead and arsenic?  It all looks the same on a TDS meter."

Even if this notion were ever to gain complete acceptance by the scientific world, Jewish thought, unlike the reasoning of the high priest of that notion, would nonetheless never summon us to revere a still extant representative of this primal form as the supposed ancestor of us all. Rather, Judaism in that case would call upon its adherents to give even greater reverence than ever before to the one, sole God Who, in His boundless creative wisdom and eternal omnipotence, needed to bring into existence no more than one single, amorphous nucleus and one single law of “adaptation and heredity” in order to bring forth, from what seemed chaos but was in fact a very definite order, the infinite variety of species we know today, each with its unique characteristics that sets it apart from all other creatures.

namer98,TrueChristian,1389573655.0,"Rabbis speech:

The Manna fell for the Jews. The importance of the manna is that the Jews depended on God for their daily sustenance. Several pieces of midrashic literature talk about the manna and specifics about it. For example, you only had the first third of the day to collect it before it is gone. But why did the manna have to fall at all? Why couldn't it appear as food in their tents?

The lesson is that God meets us halfway. God says ""I will gladly provide for you, but you have to do your half the job"".

But my Rabbi then presents another piece of midrashic literature. That some people just sometimes didn't get the manna. They overslept, they were lazy, didn't matter the reason. They never got the manna. So what food did they have? This piece says that the Jews set up a fund, a charity pool, to give their manna to the ones who for whatever reason, good or bad, got to eat.

Just as God showed mercy on the Jews by just giving them manna without expecting anything back, even though the Jews complained time after time, we need to show that same mercy towards each other.

No, you've got it backwards. You have the capability to control the positions of two people, rather than only one.

&gt;While you are engaged you don't have measure, and you have reduced awareness.

Again, you have it backwards. When you're engaged you have increased awareness. You can feel what the person you're clinching is going to do so you can focus your sight entirely on the person you're not clinched with, instead of having to split it between two.

&gt;Again, not compared to not being engaged. By the time you are aware of the changing situation, it's going to take seconds to start responding. By that time you're getting steel cap boots in the ribs. 

Only if you're a terrible grappler. If you're competent, it's less than a second from ground to standing, plus, your points about reduced awareness therefore delayed reaction are wrong because awareness is actually increased.

&gt;This is a terrible assumption to make when your life is on the line.

It's not a terrible assumption if you already know by name most of the people whom you don't have a skill advantage on. If you're assuming you suck at grappling, then sure, your assumptions are valid.

I don't really see the analogy. I mean, honestly I think we ought to have a better understanding of the atrocities suffered by North Korea, both at the hands of South Korea and the US, just so we have a better grasp on the context that produced their craziness. But North Korea/South Korea doesn't include continuing violence, only threats. It doesn't include occupation, sieges, annexation, bombings, etc. 

&gt; The Israelis and the Palestinians are like the Capulets and the Montaguea, stuck in a silly, childish war of tit-for-tats which dates just after the British/French conquest of the Ottoman Empire and the Balfour Plan.

That's like saying the colonists and Indians were engaged in a childish tit-for-tat type thing. It masks the fact that one side was getting wiped out (not the case for Palestine, just to be clear) and the other was expanding.

&gt; Do you, as a rational person, honestly expect Israel to relinquish that advantage with nothing in return?

Did I expect white Americans to relinquish our advantage over black Americans? I don't ""expect"" anything, I *hope* for it. 

&gt;In their vacuum, we have ever more ideologically fragmented populations, and the shift from political (solvable) fault lines to tribal (unsolvable) fault lines between the two.

Again, there's some truth to this, and it's mainstream American opinion. But it relies on a false equivalency that blames Palestinians as much for their predicament as it does Israel. They are reacting to ongoing subjugation by a foreign occupier. It's ludicrous to demand that *they* reform. Israel has the power here, along with US. That's really important. WE could stop this if we told Israel to obey international law, withdraw to the '67 borders, and threatened to cut them off from our massive support unless they obeyed. Which they would because they would have to. This is a solvable issue, and the solution is most likely to come from the United States. American public opinion just needs to be shifted. And that's gradually happening, and will continue to I think, because the truth is hard to suppress."

&gt; King became very meta in his later years, most of his later stuff is about writing in some way or another. The character begins again, the author begins again, the reader begins again.
&gt; 
&gt; Based on the plot, I've always suspected that Roland is either in hell or purgatory or he never left the pink stone.
&gt; 
&gt; I always thought that purgatory or hell was the most likely with his actual death occurring at Jericho Hill. He's led into a blistering landscape by one of the devil's agents. The tale grows more fantastic from that point, jumping between worlds being one example. Like Sisyphus, every time he toils his way to the top, he is sent back to the beginning. King mentions in Storm of the Century and other works (all things serve the Beam) that ""hell is repetition.""
&gt; 
&gt; The other characters are likely in hell/purgatory with him. We know that Jake was pushed in front of the car before he initially entered Roland's world. It wouldn't be hard to imagine Eddie dying at Balazar's after the Mexico trip and Odetta being shot by an overzealous store security guard. After they've all redeemed themselves, they leave Roland's world for one in which they are all happy.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps on his first 18 trips through, Roland betrayed the Ka Tet at some point. This time, he got it all right and thus remembered to grab the horn at the start of the next cycle, so that he could fully ascend and enter the Tower. "

Basically, if the only thing you know about a person is a negative quality they possess, every judgement you make of that person will be harsher.

Likewise there is the Halo effect. If all you know about a person is a positive quality they possess, all your judgements will be kinder toward them.

Example, Steve is ugly, John is attractive. Steve and John say the same unkind joke. Steve is an asshole, John is funny.

* One large scoop of all natural peanut butter (dont have an exact measurement on this). Maybe 1/2 cup (120 mL)

* 1 Banana 
* Olive oil or coconut oil

This is the study I am pulling my information from:
&gt; McArdle WD, et al. (2010). Human energy expenditure during rest and physical activity. In Exercise Physiology: Nutrition, Energy, and Human Performance, 7th ed., pp. 192–205. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This paper is cited numerous times as explaining that eating breakfast can increase resting metabolism by 10%.  So yea...when you first wake up from a resting metabolic rate, eating breakfast can ""jump-start"" your active metabolic rate.  If you would like to contribute a difference phrase that more accurately describes the biochemical process, then by all means, please continue.  But I think it's easy enough to understand that metabolism is the total of all catabolic, exergonic, anabolic, endergonic reactions; i.e. if you aren't eating anything, then the chemical process of catabolism isn't processing nutrients, thus, your metabolic pathways aren't being utilized to their fullest potential and you are expending less energy."

DC operates its own independent healthcare exchange, and DC hospitals like George Washington University Hospital, Georgetown Medstar, Howard University, and Sibley are all totally unaffected by this plan. They have no such caps in place. They're in DC, not Maryland. This law/plan is for the state of Maryland and expands on existing price caps that have been in place in Maryland since the 70s without incident. DC has no such system in place, in spite of your claims that both 'share the same mentality' and have identical political culture.

**Nas &amp; Damian Marley - Distant Relatives**

I've always liked the song Strong Will Continue, decided to listen to the rest because I've been wanting to get more into reggae. Nice album but gets a bit meh towards the end.

**ATCQ - Midnight Marauders**

**CHVRCHES - The Bones of What You Believe**

I love this album, can't wait to hear more from them.

RaCaS123,CrazyIdeas,1389574595.0,"1. Pay for the movie with your mobile phone/tablet connected to the airport WiFi. This generates a secure code which can be scanned by a theatre door attendant. The theatre door attendant confirms to the system that you have indeed entered the theatre.

2. Watch the movie for maybe one hour? (You have a flight to catch).

3. Upon exiting the theatre you boot up your phone/tablet you used to pay for the cinema ticket and immediately tell that you have stopped watching the film. You then watch the remainder on your flight (on your device).

What issues does this solve?

1. Secure, easy and quick payment allows for speedy theatre entry
2. Ability to watch the rest of the movie on the plane.
3. The action of stopping the movie after having watched an hour of it, means your device will only download the remainder - this allows for quicker downloads and means you don't need to waste any storage space on film you've already seen.
4. You can show brand new movies on a tablet with the studios resting assured that you have entered a theatre to see it."

So then it's really more like a 90/10% split: 90% of people who are assholes (the vast minority) and the rest of that portion either defending them, enabling them, attacking their victims, or staying utterly silent when they behave like assholes. Maybe 10% of people say something like ""yo, I agree, not cool"" and I'm being *really* generous with that 10%.

The problem actually isn't the assholes. It's the people who by their actions, insure that they make it a better environment for assholes than people targeted by assholes. Which is most people.

It also allows for a better contrast with ""fundies"" (fundamentalist Christians) and Chick-Fil-A, because of their firmly right-of-center stances on certain issues (Chick-Fil-A - anti-homosexual) and the fact that those who support the use of and legalization of pot are stereotyped to have firmly left-of-center."

heartosay,Catholicism,1389574870.0,"You may well be right but I strongly suspect that, whatever the public stance of the SSPX, many of its adherents would consider the post-VII Church to be a heresy or something close to it, considering the contempt in which they seem to hold it and its members.

I therefore sincerely doubt that any of them would consider my claim ""unfair"". Inaccurate, maybe, but I don't imagine they would be too put out by it.

Edit: it seems you are indeed correct. See [here](http://sspx.org/en/must-catholics-attend-new-mass). Money quote:

&gt;We do not consider the new rite to be heretical, but rather gravely equivocal, and favoring heresy. This rite was in fact elaborated with the discreet (but not too discreet) cooperation of certain “Protestant experts” so that it would be acceptable to both the Catholics and the Protestants.

The contempt towards the NO oozes throughout that entire article but they have just enough of a sense of self-preservation not to dub it a heresy *per se*. Elsewhere:

&gt;The Church imposes the obligation to hear Mass “in the Catholic rite,”[3] but a protestantized rite cannot at the same time be characterized as Catholic. Moreover, a “protestantizing” rite exposes the faithful to “considerable spiritual harm,” which is one of the strongest reasons exempting from the Sunday obligation of assistance at Mass. And as it involves danger for our own faith and for that of our dependents, for whom we are responsible before God, we must say that whoever is conscious of this danger, insofar as he is conscious of it, far from satisfying the Church’s precept, rather commits a sin against faith [by attending the N.O.M.]."

xthorgoldx,KarmaCourt,1389574877.0,"I move to dismiss this case as groundless.

/u/dahej presents the case as one of mod discrimination, going so far as to base his charges on an unrelated, undefined ""EA Conspiracy."" His presented evidence is the following:

1. The [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1uzeu9/advanced_dogfighting_maneuver/) was being heavily upvoted and
2. Several [comments](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1uzeu9/advanced_dogfighting_maneuver/cencif5?context=4) talked of EA ""in a negative light"" and
3. The post was removed for reasons unknown, postulated to be because of a conspiracy to shield the public from the fact that ""C4 can be attached to a mid air plane ""not only in battlefield,""""

While I can provide no explanatio nfor the removal of the post itself, the presented evidence is insufficient for a charge of mod abuse, let alone a charge of conspiracy.

1. At present, the linked post has a total of 104 upvotes and 21 downvotes. The post was made at 21:11:02 UTC. The comments that led to the supposed conspiracy weren't posted until 21:**28**:32, and the last post in the chain wasn't made until 01:53:01. Assuming that the submission was hidden at that exact moment, that still leaves the post with a mere 83 upvotes over a period of four hours, forty-two minutes. In other words, the submission was nowhere near close to reaching the frontpage of /r/gaming by any stretch of the imagination, even if it had received all of its upvotes in the 17-minute window between submission and the first anti-EA post.

2. The comments posted were *not* heavily upvoted, with the first being ranked at 7-7. That said, no sane mod would delete a submission over the posting of a single person on an idea unrelated to the submission, otherwise Reddit would see more of this kind of behavior - ""suiciding bombing"" submissions to get them removed by posting rule-breaking comments. No - in the event that a comment contains objectionable material, the *comment* is removed, not the submission itself.

3. In regards to the accusation of an ""EA Conspiracy,"" the sheer volume of precedent against that charge is so staggering that merely searching for ""EA"" in /r/gaming [produces a list of topics primarily devoted to anti-EA opinions, all frontpaged and some voted into /r/all.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/search?q=EA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all). One need only look to /r/gaming's reaction to SimCity to gauge the general opinion of the subreddit in regards to EA. If the claimant's accusations of there being a mod-based conspiracy to censor anti-EA materials, such a conspiracy would either be incompetent or incredibly lazy.''

In conclusion, while the action taken against the claimant might have some merit in wrongdoing, given the absence of discernible rules violations in the original post, at present the accusations of mod abuse on the basis of an ""EA Conspiracy"" are baseless to the point of being slander. This accusation, should it be brought to trial, would be nothing but a waste of the court's time, energy, and good name.

**Furthermore,** I am half-convinced to bring charges against /u/dahej on grounds of Karma Whoring, given a post history of multiple reposts of this singular .gif to /r/planetside, /r/highlightGIFs, /r/gaming, and /r/GamePhysics within a timespan of 24 hours almost to the point of spam."

I have a two-part message for said Niners fans: 

1. We are different fan bases. Not saying we're better fans (just kidding. I am.), we simply have different philosophies. Fans in the stadium have a direct relationship with the Hawks defense. Our mission is to impact the outcome. And the organization has responded by building the entire game experience around the role the 12th man plays. Because they know it gives the team a critical advantage. Unlike some teams (read: yours) our organization doesn't cater to Silicon Valley billionaires by making an entire side of our new stadium an ugly wall of corporate suites. 

2. Stop being such fucking babies. "
flashmedallion,assassinscreed,1389575116.0,"Agreed; There's no reason we have to play the guy in charge.  In fact that would make the game stronger in some ways.

Maybe you have a small division of Assassins that you can train and deploy or whatever, but playing an Assassin, who's not the head honcho, who has been assigned to a certain area/Templar ""group""/Target would be fine.  Maybe there's a personal motivation as well, and this is why he's been assigned, that could work fine.

But we've gotten past the idea of ""training"" in the Animus, and now it's just research.  Just a capable guy, who has a leadership position in the order (but not *the* leadership position) could be perfectly interesting."

Rerichael,gainit,1389575190.0,"Read the ole FAQ to begin with. Pleathora of info there, really helped me out.

Next, you're gonna want to get specific on your goals. Do you want to just gain weight? Do you want to get muscular? Do you want to increase your strength? Do you want to do a combination of these things? The choice is yours and yours alone.

Check out the program picker in the sidebar. Another fantastic resource. Normally, guys here will suggest Starting Strength. That's a good one for getting a basis of strength, and you'll also gain some size/weight. Personally, I started with StrongLifts 5x5, then switched to IceCreamFitness 5x5. Those two are essentially the same program, but ICF has a little bit more accessory work. **DO NOT** try to come up with your own workout plan. You might hear a lot of brotalk from dudes at the gym about their various workouts but, don't let them get to you. Stick to the program you choose. 

Finally, the best advice for gaining I can give you: Eat. If you're serious about gaining, you need to be eating every waking hour of the day. You can find a caloric calculator in the, you guessed it, sidebar! My advice to you is to get used to ingesting between 2500-3000 calories a day. It doesn't matter as much as what you're eating as much as it matters how much you're eating. Now this isn't a pass to eat burgers and fries every day and call it a day. But as long as you're eating relatively healthy, you'll be alright to start with. Chicken and Pasta are your best friends when bulking. 

Once you get used to eating as much as possible, then I recommend you start counting your macros. Carbs, Protein, etc. Counting your macros will help your gaining significantly, because you've probably not been eating as much of certain macros as you should. You can absolutely start counting from the beginning, but it can be hard when you're starting out to get used to eating that much food AND have to worry about eating the right amount of carbs and protein, so I always recommend you condition your body for the AMOUNT of food, then you worry about what types of food you're eating. But I cannot, CANNOT, stress enough. Eat ALWAYS. You should be eating even if you're full. If your friends are making fun of you because you're always eating, then you are doing it right. The tagline of the Sub is ""Go Eat"" for a reason.

That covers everything for the basics I would say. As the old adage goes, ""Eat big, Sleep big, Lift big, Get big.""

Good luck, and good gains!"

Ker_Splish,electricians,1389575397.0,"&gt; First off, is getting a foot in the door one if those you-have-to-know-somebody things?

It depends on the local shop.  Generally, no, but like with any job anywhere, it does help to have someone putting a bug in HR's ear for you.  

&gt; And are you away from home for days and days?

Nope.  Now, I'm in the industrial/facilities maintenance side, and I'm home every night and weekend.  I go to the same shop, 5 days a week, and replace light bulbs, fix extension cords, and install, maintain, upgrade and repair industrial equipment.  (Welders, plasma torches, man lifts, automated media blast facilities, etc)  

As a Locomotive electrician, you'd do similar stuff, but mainly focus on the internal electrical workings/software interface on diesel-electric locomotives.  (I'm sure they'd pull someone off of loco maintenance if all the lights in the boss' bathroom went out, lol)  But, same thing, same shop, all week.  

Signal Maintenance is different; I think you are basically assigned a region.  It can be pretty big, sometimes over an entire state or two.  You'd generally be ""on call,"" driving all over the place to fix broken RR crossings and dispatch equipment.  (If you're a drinker, I hear that you must be VERY careful, as you can often get called into work just as soon as you wanna pop the top.)  This option is one of the higher paying ones, as you get meal allowances and metric pant-loads of overtime.  I know guys who have cleared $80,000/year with overtime here.

mundabit,birthcontrol,1389575407.0,"I had 3 GYN's discuss this (apparently my vagina was interesting so they all came in to look, gotta love teaching hospitals), and they still didn't have a fully solid answer. But apparently the effect of chamomile on CYP3A4 has only been tested in a small trail where it had no effect, But on rat trails it *does* have en effect, so the general consensus is that in humans,  chamomile wont effect Progesterone metabolises. I asked about other hebal medications and St. John’s wort was the only one they have mentioned on their paperwork, and they noted that in order to get enough furanocoumarin (from pomelo's and grapefruit) to inhibit the enzyme you would die of Water intoxication from the juice.

The other part to this is that even though something may effect progestin metaboloisis, that's still not a guarantee that the implant *will* be effected, Its just like antibiotics and the pill, better safe than sorry.

All 3 GYNs assured me that nothing topical, will effect the Implant."

I dont know your situation, but were you ok with her leaving you out in the first place? Is it normal for her to have a woman over and not involve you? 

His jealousy continued long after our sexual relationship ended and the biggest problem was that he didn't believe her when she told him flat out that we were only friends. I felt horrible that our friendship made him flip and he self destructed and ruined their marriage because of his insecurities. I'm not saying this will happen to you, but really man, talk to your wife. She loves you and this girl may become attached but she needs to remind her that you are her husband. This girl may just want a friend and already having sex with your wife has strengthened an emotional bond. Just be open and honest. Thats all you can do."

funkmon,roosterteeth,1389575522.0,"These types of things were more of a product of the times, where online communities are less common and centralized, and a thing like a group video was a big project. 

That said, at the time of the new site, that is the community site, Red Vs Blue took a bit of flack for even doing it. There was a phpBB forum up until late 04, when the site launched. A few of us even boycotted the new site as we didn't like the journals and crap like that, which is why if you check my registration time, it wasn't until 05. Those videos and community projects at the time were not seen as a big undertaking and a big deal, because people were remembering when it was all a phpBB forum, where everyone legitimately for real no joke knew each other, and new users were a curiosity, and hosting your own video was nigh on impossible. The influx of people from the community site made it all somehow a bit more impersonal while trying to make it less impersonal. It's hard to explain. Anyway, there was always a community before the current one, and it was always somehow more personal and better. Before RvB's phpBB forums, people talked about the Halo videos on halo.bungie.org's forum, or battleground Halo, or something like that. With the proliferation of Halo fansites, the forums splintered, and being personable was more difficult.

They say things like the website is now all about the staff and crap. It's kind of true, but it was actually the same way back then. There were maybe 50 or so big users that everybody knew, and then a bunch of smaller users who dabbled in obscurity. Now, it's much the same but 50 of the biggest users are on the payroll.

I'm taking a negative tone in this thread because I know that recreating a past community is difficult to impossible. It needs to be done organically.

But for you, who wants to be a part of an online community, just find your interests online and register on a forum or something, or, of course, Rooster Teeth's website. It's not hard."

As others have said, without knowing anything about your body type it's hard to say what would work best.  I'm bottom-heavy and look terrible in fitted styles (with a pencil-type skirt, etc.), but empire waists look like maternity gowns on me.  I need something that has a natural/dropped waist and flares out from there.  I prefer not to wear strapless, but I am stuck wearing one for a wedding in May because it's what the bride chose.  I will probably bring a wrap to put on as soon as I can, lol.

ETA:

Even if you don't end up buying from there, go to a place like David's where you can try on all of the different shapes/styles in your size.  You'll figure out what works best on you and can use that information when you shop around.  At many other stores, you might have to order without trying on."

2. In a real face-off, if one of the centers commits an infraction (mostly commonly moving too early or interfering with the other guy), they kick him out and make somebody else take the face-off. The little kid kicked out the visiting center to be funny."

I still occasionally see him.

Another guy that I broke up with earlier this year always shamed me and was condescending as all hell, and he got drunk one Valentines night where we'd gotten a hotel. Told me that he'd paid all this money for a hotel (we had split it, actually), and that if I wasn't willing to get drunk with him and have sex with him, that he had wasted his money and time.

Necron_Overlord,OneY,1389575739.0,"I don't think the author came close to making the case for their thesis, and some of the arguments are just ludicrous.  Here's where his whole argument simply falls flat on its face in one sentence:

&gt;In a knowledge-based, words-based economy, these boys have to learn to play nice, just as women have had to learn to be aggressive and ambitious to succeed in the upper echelons of business.

The ""upper echelons of business"" are *part of* the ""knowledge-based, words-based economy.""  So the author is saying that to succeed men have to become more like women, and women have to become more like men.  This is argument that folds back on itself.

But really, the silliest part of this whole argument is this line right here, where the author demonstrates that he* has *no idea* what he's talking about when he says ""masculinity"":

&gt;Men must become more like women if they want to be able to continue fulfilling their more masculine roles as earners and providers.

Masculinity is a social construct that differentiates men from women.  Men experience a crises of masculinity when they are unable to meaningfully define themselves as different from woman, so any theory that proposes to address the issues in masculinity by having men become ""more like"" women is a theory that fails on its face.

The American economy is not ruining masculinity.  Feminism is ruining masculinity by defining femininity as ""being exactly like men and not letting men have any identity unique to themselves.""  Construction was one of the last bastions of masculinity because women don't do that kind of work and don't want to.  But the economy is not why masculinity is in retreat in the fist place.

*Edit: Just realized the author is a woman.  Now I understand why she doesn't understand masculinity and why she's defending feminism."

In those concept drawings, I wouldn't mind how they make the bridge look. The conceptualizers have made considerations about the aesthetics of the barriers.

MattieShoes,learndota2,1389575859.0,"Yes, it's very possible.  All Elo-based rating systems basically calculate an expected result based on current ratings (say, 53% chance of win), then adjust your rating based on the difference between actual and expected results (1 - .53 for a win or 0 - 0.53 for a loss) and then multiply it by a number called the K factor (like 50 for instance) to calculate point change.  

So the only thing that matters is the difference between your actual results and your expected results.  The matchmaking system HAPPENS to make games where your expected chance of winning is near 50%, but that doesn't really matter.  For the Dendis of the world, they may have an expected 65% winrate simply because there aren't enough good players to match him against.  In theory, there's also an anti-dendi at the other end of the spectrum with some exceptionally low rating who is only expected to win 35% due to lack of players bad enough.  

If you improve, your MMR should go up.  The sad truth is that most people improve, then hit a plateau and stay there.  That was part of the reason Valve was reluctant to show ratings, because then it becomes OBVIOUS that you aren't improving.  

That said, this is a brand new rating pool, so all sorts of shit may be going on, like new people entering the pool in huge numbers, rating points moving from one server to another via people who queue on both, etc, so the same rating may over time have a different meaning."

lamblikeawolf,short,1389575888.0,"It is a matter of feeling welcome. To me, downvotes are a way to guage the overall mind-frame of a subreddit. When I receive a downvote, I feel as though someone is saying, ""What you have said is factually wrong."" or ""You sound like an asshole."" Because the purpose of a downvote is supposed to be when something doesn't contribute to discussion, rather than as a way of disagreeing with someone.

While I can write off a few of them as people just being disgruntled individuals, or not understanding how downvotes are supposed to work, if there are the same number of upvotes as downvotes, especially on a post that includes very personal experiences, I feel as though: my experience is factually wrong, my experience is the experience of an asshole thereby making me an asshole, my experience is so disagreeable to the people of the sub that I should not have even bothered posting it. And if it is actually in the negatives it is even worse.

Personally, I am not particularly affected by downvotes enough to change my behavior. However, that doesn't mean I don't feel those things. I very carefully reconsider my comments when they've been significantly downvoted.

For example, when I shared that story the other day about meeting my mom's first husband, it started off being in negative votes when I last checked it before going to sleep. On top of that, there were two comments, one of which seemed particularly accusatory, and that I didn't really know how to respond to. I felt awful. I felt like I had shared this strange beautiful feeling and experience, and someone had smacked it out of my hand and crunched it on the floor into a million little pieces. And I went to sleep wondering whether or not I should have shared it, and I honestly debated whether or not I would share those kinds of things in the future. 

By the next day, it had a much wider variety of responses, as well as several upvotes, which made me feel better, and throw out all of my self-torment from the night before. However, without that positivity, I might have decided to share less in the future. Because I felt that kind of story would not be welcome here.

If enough kinds of stories and responses I give tell me I am not wanted, I am not going to feel wanted. And then I will leave, or stay silent.

I can only speak to my own personal experiences, but maybe this kind of thing happens with other females (and maybe males too?) on the subreddit too."

In that order, they should all have an increasing window to trigger a counter, but the longer the counter window, the longer the kill animation.

This rewards skill and gives options for efficiency or crowd control.  Daggers being the ""medium"" approach.  I think it's a bit silly how Edward spends two seconds brutalizing someone with the hidden blade after a counter.  He should do a quick stab to the heart or FACE and then move on quickly.

I recall that when I was breeding Larvitars, with a mother that knew Pursuit, Stealth Rock, and Dragon Dance, and a (Gible) father that knew  Outrage and Iron Head, it depended on the order of the moves that the Gible knew (all 3 mother's egg moves were inherited, as Bulbapedia said would happen).  When Outrage was the bottom move for the Gible (in the summary screen where you can change the order of the moves), the eggs inherited Outrage as the fourth move.  When Iron Head was the bottom move, they inherited Iron Head as the fourth move.  I'm also fairly certain that the move that they did *not* inherit was *not* teachable by the Move Reminder.

I want to love the movie because of the positive sides

* Acting

* Scenery

* Cinematography

* Ennio Morricone's godly score

But certain things held it back

* Characters I don't care about

* Relatively simple script

* Conflict not well established

Del_Sol,Coffee,1389576267.0,"There are ways to make better coffee with the machine you have.  You didn't even tell us what the machine is, so lets assume it's a drip maker.  Start off with buying better beans.  Don't buy your coffee pre-ground.  Buy fresh beans, I know my local trader joes carries fresh beans.  Most local coffee shops will as well.  If you can't afford a grinder then most stores/shops will grind it when you buy it.  Store it in an air tight container, preferably away from light in a cold place (freezer/fridge works well.)  When you go to make it let the water circulate in the machine, leave the pot out from under neath it.  This will bring up the water tempature giving you a better brew.  Then put in your filter and the grounds.  Move the spout over it and let it fill about half way with water.  Mix it up, you want all the grounds covered.  Then put your pot under it, this will give you a much better cup of joe than what you've been getting.  

If you have the money, I'd buy a grinder first.  Hand grinders work well but I personally like electric ones, you can get a cheap one at your local second-hand store or you can get really fancy and pay up to 400-500 dollars for one.  I personally use a lower end cuisinart grinder and it works well enough for me.  (It won't do to well for espresso though.)

After that if you still have some money left over I'd buy a French Press.  They're cheap, easy to use, and make an amazing cup of coffee.  There's info all over the web and this subreddit about them.  There are other options too like percolators, the Aeropress (people on this subreddit seem to love them, for good reason), flat drip makers, among others.  

Start with getting better coffee and learning to brew it the best using the machine you have.  If you want something better I'd check your local second-hand stores first.  People are always getting rid of coffee machines and you can pick them up pretty cheap.  Good luck!"

This method of swaying from side to side shown in the video is a simple solution that turns the force of gravity acting on the object into a tool, propelling it by it's own momentum of falling. This reduces the effort big time.

Even if you were to put the statues on logs to roll them, and pull/push them that way, it would take 50-100 men to move something that heavy. The method in the video is being performed with less than 30 people, and could probably be done with even less than that if the crew were comfortable with the process.

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389576534.0,"&gt; Let's look at some actual numbers here. Suppose 1k/mo UBI for adults, plus a couple hundred per kid, and single payer health care. Living on 1k/mo with no work obligations is trivial. All you need is a place to live and food. Health care is covered and you don't need to pay for transportation to work. Keep in mind this is across the whole US, and you can just move somewhere where the cost of living is cheap. I mean, my expenses minus health care are only a bit higher than that, and I live in a nice apartment in a fairly expensive city (with one other person), and I eat really well. I certainly wouldn't have to work if I didn't want to and I'm in a pretty nice situation.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; When you are working a minimum wage job, you have to own and maintain a car to drive to work, you have to pay for your own health insurance, you have to pay taxes, and you may not be able to work full-time. So a direct comparison between that and UBI is not going to give correct results.

You also forget utilities, basic expenses, differing cost of living areas, etc.

&gt;If lots of people work multiple jobs now, surely many of them will only work 1 job under UBI. And a bet a lot of people who are just not happy in their job will quit if conditions don't improve.

Not if you cut the amount people make off of jobs.

The point I'm trying to make is UBI will BARELY cut it. It's absolutely STUPID to eliminate the minimum wage, and seeing how this is like the 10th time I've had this convo, I'm really not interested in having it again. People should be paid a decent amount for their labor, PERIOD.

&gt; What hurts people is not having enough money.

So you want people to earn less?

You do realize without a decent minimum wage employers will just try to rationalize giving crappy wages because they can just push people onto UBI, right?

&gt;. So much poverty-fighting in this country has been based on the idea of getting people jobs, forcing employers to pay people more money, making employers pay for health insurance, and you see the result of that. 

So they dont pay for payroll taxes and health insurance and part of the problem is fixed already. They just pay the wages. And seeing how we might have people dropping out of the workforce, let the wage stay where it is.

Eliminating minimum wage just puts people back in the situation they are already in, quite frankly. It legitimizes employers paying their workers crap wages. It's a bad idea.

&gt;This doesn't need to be so. UBI is easily painted as the free market version of welfare, i.e. an improvement over the current system. It's true there's a lot of opposition to it, but that opposition comes from both major parties. I really believe if this is to work in the US it will need support from members of both parties.

My focus is to get the voters on the side of UBI....a party will oppose UBI regardless...just look at how republicans turned on their own healthcare reform bill when the dems proposed it. UBI will help 80% of the country, and I wanna make sure of that. Get rid of minimum wage and you'll have a lot of people going on about how it destroyed the economy and now they'ere making so much less money and have to pay higher taxes and blah blah blah. No. Just no.

&gt;The effects of minimum wage are poorly understood with biased studies all around, and the effects of a UBI are understood even less.

Even more of a reason to not make rash decisions in getting rid of something that's there to help workers.

Look. I've had this discussion before. MANY TIMES. I'm not really interested in having it again. I think getting rid of the minimum wage could screw up the entire economy. Businesses want to externalize their costs. They already make their workers go on welfare. Getting rid of minimum wage, even with UBI, will just hurt people, especially those who make higher than minimum wage, because you're proposing changing the entire wage structure. So people who work may end up making less money, WHILE paying more taxes, which will make UBI an economy killing failure.

When we pass UBI, it needs to be done right. And I don't think eliminating the minimum wage will help. You talk of compromise, but look where that got us with obamacare....a crappy bill that doesn't really fix the problem all that good (at least not without creating a host of new ones), and people from both sides now oppose it because it's not what anyone wanted. I get the impression that eliminating the minimum wage is more of a value argument meant to appeal to libertarians rather than a pragmatic one based on maximizing the benefit of the American populace.

Look, if UBI were like $30k a year, I'd be more open to the idea. If I had tons of studies in front of me saying eliminate the minimum wage would help, not hurt, I would be more open to the idea (as long as they're not from blatant conservative thinktanks like the mises institute or something). But considering how UBI is the bare minimum to live, and heck, only that in some low cost areas, if we want to have more economic mobility, we will need a minimum wage. With all the talk of ""living wages"" and $15/hour and stuff, UBI is the way to do it. Eliminating minimum wage will just put them back in the same situation, or, if you're someone who works a higher paying job or multiple jobs, even worse. It will kill social mobility. It's a bad idea, and you're not gonna convince me otherwise because I've seen all these arguments before.

Sorry if I'm being harsh. I'm just not interested in discussing this for the 11th time before I already considered the idea and find it to be bad. "

""The sons of Earendil were Elros and Elrond, the Peredhil or Half-elven. ---At the end of the First Age the Valar gave to the Half-elven an irrevocable choice to which kindrer they would belong. Elrond chose to be of Elven-kin and became a master of wisdom. To him therefore was granted the same grace as to those of the High Elves that still lingered in Middle-earth: that when weary at last of the mortal lands they could take ship from the Grey Havens and pass unto the Uttermost West; and this grace continued after the change of the world.--- Elros chose to be of Man-kind and remain with the Edain; but a great life-span was granted to him many times that of lesser men.""

This what was I was thinking. I guess it doesn't relate to OP's question as men were already in existence. That story is just about the origins of the Numenorians.

* Warm Bacon/Onion Salad: Here's a [good recipe](http://www.thetasteplace.com/2011/07/16/closet-cookings-spinach-salad-with-bacon-carmelized-onions-and-mushrooms-in-a-warm-bacon-pan-dressing/) although if I don't have a lot of time I just make the bacon, caramelize the onions, poach/fry an egg and mix together. The onions &amp; runny egg make a pretty good sauce.

* Chicken Thighs with Savoy Cabbage &amp; Ramen. I like using Mi Goreng ramen because the flavor packets are awesome and it's crazy cheap.

* Roasted pork tenderloin with any steamed vegetable you like, maybe sauteed mushrooms or a salad as well.

* This [Asian Glazed Chicken](http://www.skinnytaste.com/2010/07/asian-glazed-drumsticks.html) recipe. You can swap the drumsticks with boneless, skinless chicken thighs if you prefer. It also makes a great filling for lettuce wraps.

**Desserts**

* Lava Cakes: [This recipe](http://joythebaker.com/2008/04/gooey-chocolate-cakes/) is pretty simple and usually impresses people.

* [Chocolate Pudding](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/02/best-chocolate-pudding/) or [Caramel Pudding](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/01/caramel-pudding/) is always delicious.

* Pumpkin Pie: I make this in ramekins because fuck pastry crust.

There are countless examples of ""fighters"" who had what you consider to be sufficient training getting massacred. You need sparring. That's what's consistent among the martial artists who succeed. Whatever the rule set is, those who spar beat those who don't. That's why Wing Chun is largely useless despite having solid principles that boxers demonstrate as being effective. They're right about the principles, but without the sparring, they never learn how to apply them properly. Without any instruction on principles, sparring will teach you. That's why when you take a style and add sparring, it ends up looking like kickboxing, if it's a standup style."

wufoo2,sex,1389576802.0,"I have an idea that might help, based on my own experience.

I used to soap and wash my glans and inner foreskin daily, thinking I'd be more presentable to a potential sex partner. But what I ended up with was a shrunken foreskin that no longer closed at the end; a hypersensitive glans that didn't like being touched; and a bad-smelling penis. (The last one because a dehydrated glans and inner foreskin absorb urine, rather than repel it.)

Somewhere I learned that the inner foreskin and glans are mucosa, not skin. Soap has no business there, anymore than inside our eyelids or nostrils. And the inner foreskin is [self-cleaning](http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/inspect.htm), again like the eyelids, so regular, deliberate washing actually does more harm than good by stripping away the natural substances.

So I started by eliminating soap and after a wash, not drying the glans before closing the foreskin. I started seeing more of my foreskin then, and if I went a few days with no washing at all, it got even longer and more pliable. As long as I rinsed before oral sex, my wife was fine with that.

Then, because I didn't make enough smegma to recover from nighttime erections and even weekly rinsings, I would add a thin layer of pure aloe gel to the glans before closing, and leave it there. I immediately got a much longer foreskin and the return of the ""pucker"" I hadn't seen since puberty.

But the surprise benefit was normalized sensitivity. My glans no longer made me jump when touched. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but a moist glans seems to handle contact better than a dehydrated one. Maybe it's because a dry glans within a foreskin can't form the [keratinization](http://www.stopthecut.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/12336060979711.jpg) (NSFW) that protects circumcised guys from friction. So it's an uncomfortable middle.

Anyway, now my sensitivity is just fine. My wife can even do something that would have had me howling before: after my glans has dried a bit in the open air, she can administer a ""dry rub"" with her fingers to the glans and whole inner foreskin, sliding loosely and rapidly from top to bottom and back. It feels so good it makes my eyes flutter. She also prefers the softness and suppleness my foreskin has now.

I hope this is useful to you. It won't cost you anything (aside from a bottle of pure aloe gel, perhaps) and if it doesn't work you can always try something else."

Sorry, but again, I have to disagree.  TDS is a *secondary standard*.  [See EPA's List of Drinking Water Contaminants](http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/), near the bottom of the page:

&gt;National Secondary Drinking Water Regulations (NSDWRs or secondary standards) are non-enforceable guidelines regulating contaminants that may cause cosmetic effects (such as skin or tooth discoloration) or aesthetic effects (such as taste, odor, or color) in drinking water. EPA recommends secondary standards to water systems but does not require systems to comply. However, states may choose to adopt them as enforceable standards.

The EPA **recommends** keeping TDS under 500 mg/L because of **aesthetic effects**.  Specifically, high TDS water tastes bad.  EPA does not enforce TDS limits specifically because they are not a health hazard.

Water with TDS higher than 500 PPM is not ""considered unsafe to drink."""

Alright OP:  

Without knowing ""how low is too low"" with regards to the very low resistance (aka Sub-ohm) rebuildable coils, you can successfully explode your mechanical mod.  You must become familiar with [Ohm's Law.](http://www.csgnetwork.com/ohmslaw2.html)

You must, with a manual mod, make darn sure that your coil is not trying to draw more current than your battery is rated for.  This causes excess heat, boiled lithium battery-juice, and that generally exploding e-cig thing that the news warned you about. 

I linked to a calculator/explanation of Ohm's law above, so you can do a check to see if you might want to run thinner wire in your rebuildable.  

&gt; http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1didx2/psa_cloud_chasing_is_dangerous/

That's a great link also, compliments of /u/mustryhardr.  Definitely go there.  


(Thinner wire increases electrical resistance, causing less amperage to be sucked out of your battery.  That's how you can adjust coil resistance to compliment your battery's capacity.) 


TLDR:  Sub Ohm Coil = Higher amp draw, IF (amp draw &gt; battery capacity) THEN (KABOOM)   :P"

What I meant was that when you look at media representation, and when you examine the ""beautiful people"" in our society and what is considered ""hot"" and what is overall ""desirable"" physically or even personality wise by society at large in the United States - its not us, whether it be our body types, face shapes, facial features, our T&amp;A (or lack there of) and our personalities (as a whole). It was a very general statement, which applies more/less to different groups. I mean, we spanned the whole country and looks and culture will vary a lot.

I joined reddit about half a year ago because it was a good way to spend my boredom time.

I just discovered /r/oddlysatisfying recently, but I already love the subreddit. I would love to help out there and get to know the sub better!

Likewise, so do both caffeine and heroine.

That does not mean birth control pills, caffeine, HRT, and heroine are all the same. They just have certain features in common (particularly, they alter your body chemistry and thereby modify bodily processes). If we are going to say that heroine is bad *because it changes your body*, then we are going to have to conclude that the other three are all bad, too.

In reality, heroine is bad because it has dangerous side effects that outweigh the benefits, not because it changes your body. That's why it's worse than the other three."

AFormidableContender,confession,1389577987.0,"&gt;Well, that's true. We have our world views based on our perspective. Still, their world view is rooted in resentment and hatred.

Because they believe women deserving of resentment and hatred just as much as you believe the opposite. 

&gt;Nothing I have mentioned is an unimportant problem.

To you...

&gt;How is that gross? What's gross about dating someone who respects me?

Because Feminism is female fascism. 

Turned that around on ya!

&gt;I know a lot about the European Royal bloodlines, and I know how they chose their partners. The 80/20 scenario didn't happen. It was more like 95/95.

I never suggested they didn't choose their partners or followed 80/20. I don't know what you're talking about.

The rest of that you've agreed with me, so, that's good.

&gt;Farm animals aren't people. They aren't required to have high intellectual capabilities. They are bred to be eventually killed and eaten. And the reasons farmers often use a few males and many females is because it's cheaper.

Humans ARE animals and inbred animals will deteriorate.

&gt;A country isn't the same as a community. The US, for example, is a large country, both in population and area. But if you live in New York, your odds of marrying/reproducing with a New Yorker is substantially higher than marrying/reproducing with someone from California. Note that I said reproduce, not have sex with.
So your community is basically the region you live in, not the whole country.

Your contention is not logically consistent. 

I'm not even sure what you're debating here....Iceland is in the situation it's in because they live on an Island in the north Atlantic that was conquered by vikings and no one leaves...they've just had sex amongst themselves for hundreds of years....

...this has nothing to do with the 80/20 notion. People are free to go anywhere they please.  

PS. I am currently posting a thread on AskScience about this. 

&gt;No, they don't. In almost all cultures, monogamy is the norm. In monogamous cultures, it's much closer to 50/50.

The 80/20 does not mean monogomy does not take place. You don't LTR everyone you fuck. I mean...maybe YOU do, but most people don't...

&gt;What about guys that are not very outgoing?

You don't have to be outgoing to be alpha...most alpha's simply happen to be outgoing.

&gt;I still don't believe in the system. I think personalities fall on a sliding scale, and there are more than two ends of a spectrum.

Yea...we named those for you...they're called alpha and beta. 

&gt;Every guy I have dated was very nice to me, and nice to people around me. I don't date rude people. And I certainly don't date douchebags.

One of the most incredible abilities of the human mind is the ability to rationalize anything. Women who demand funny men suddenly claim the boring hot guy they're dating is the funniest man alive..."

badaboopdedoop,AskMen,1389578075.0,"Yes, and it was ultimately worth it.

I was with a girl for 5 years. We were long-distance for three of those years. Over the course of those three years, I cheated on her with twelve women. Terrible, I know, but I justified it by the distance, need for sex, etc. I'm not proud, but it happened.


We moved in together, and I stopped cheating. Things were pretty good for about year. After a while though, we began to argue regularly. We functioned fairly well as a domestic unit, but the romance was gone. Still, we stayed together, probably out of fear. It's hard to leave a relationship where things aren't necessarily *bad*, but they're not good either.

The final straw: I went to visit some friends for their college graduation. I got drunk and hooked up with a girl. Afterwards, I didn't feel *anything* about it. I didn't regret it. It didn't bother me that I could have hurt my girlfriend. I remember thinking that I would have done it again if given the chance.

I broke up with my girlfriend when I got home. Clearly, I didn't care about her or our relationship. The last time I cheated, I realized that I had *never* really cared about her, and I was just making poor excuses to justify bad behavior.

I feel bad about cheating. It's a terrible thing to put someone through, and I can't recommend it as an exit strategy. Still, I'm glad I did it. It's been about two years, and both me and my ex are in much better and healthier relationships.

For good Boston-based fast food, I suggest Tasty Burger in Harvard Square or by Fenway Park. It's higher-quality burger-and-fry fare. The one in Harvard Square also has a decent beer/wine bar in its basement.

Cheeseboy is a grilled cheese-centric chain that has recently exploded all over Boston. I enjoy it. 

Colbert Report is on Comedy Central in the US, on at 11:30PM Monday-Thursday. Check your hotel directory for what channel Comedy Central is on (most US hotels have different cable channel numbers than the rest of the community)

You can't really find it in bottles in Boston, but if you find a takeout place with one of those coca-cola 100+ fountain machines (the ones with the touch screens) you can find Mr. Pibb up here (Coke's version of Dr. Pepper, which I find superior).

So it's a chancey bet (in my totally anecdotal but extensive experience) and if you're looking for a frugal choice, risky probably isn't your game.


Regardless of the car you choose, make sure you have a mechanic you trust check the fuck out of it. Buying a used car is all about the prep. 


Also, check out ecomodding the car, and learning hypermiling driving tips. It will save you a fuck ton of gas. It's also fun if you're into mechanical kinda tinkering, ecomodding is as complicated as you want to make it. There is basic mods and crazy engine swap you better be a experienced mechanic or an engineer type of mods. Every drop of gas saved helps save you money, so don't think the little things don't add up.


Personally, I have a 97 honda civic hatch. 42 MPG now that I modded it (simple ones, nothing crazy.)

I haven't really been an active participant on this subreddit, but I just recently became a mod over at /r/Needafriend, which is like a helpful subset of this sub. I definitely support the nature of the sub, (helping people work through things) and even if I'm not chosen, I plan on becoming more active in it.

I spend quite a bit of time on reddit so staying active and consistent is no problem. I'm often on for hours per day, with ~~most~~ all of my ~~free~~ time spent on reddit.

I am quite familiar with the sensitive nature of things on reddit, over in /r/facepalm and /r/Needafriend there are some pretty strict personal information redaction policies.

oldmonty,AskMen,1389578616.0,"So, I used to only like white girls, light skin, long hair was my thing. My first crush was white with long brown hair, then I met this girl in high school who was Asian. She was beautiful, smart, quiet and kinda introverted like me. Ever since then Asian girls have been my thing, its probably at least partly because of the demographic of people where I live (probably over 50% Asian). I don't have anything against any other races, I've found that whatever I think is what I'm into doesn't actually mean anything if you find the right person. 

I thought I was all about light skinned girls but the girl I'm interested in now has darker skin, who would've thought. 

I guess it comes down to a few things, who the people around you are, and who you end up getting along with, as well as the people themselves. Some people you can't help but be attracted to, they are strong, smart, and outgoing while still being extremely feminine. How can you not love someone who puts on work gloves and starts grinding out a metal sheet, throwing sparks into the air while wearing a pink floral dress and flats (which incidentally was a safety hazard).

MaybeAViking,AskWomen,1389578784.0,"Film student here. It sucked so horribly, but no one can believe me when I tell them because it's such a good concept. Executed very poorly though. 

Character: I can't tell which character was less relatable, the main character, or the operating system he falls in love with. The dialogue left nothing to the imagination, it was just ""I am feeling these feels and you are feeling feels!""

Plot: Standard Manic Pixie Dream Girl trash. Lonely guy finds his life to have no flavor. Enter Manic Pixie Dream Girl (in the form of Scarlett Johannson's voice). He learns to live, to love, to enjoy himself and his life! Then, tragedy strikes! The pair outgrow each other and both leave the relationship all sad and wistful.

Cinematography/Art/Production Design: Everyone tells me ""Well, if you didn't like the plot, you must have at least liked the look of the film, right?"" Wrong. The film relied too heavily on closeups and POV shots. If I had the patience to sit through the damn thing again, I'd hold a stopwatch and calculate exactly what portion of the film is occupied by closeups of Joaquin Phoenix's face. All fluff and no variety in  shots makes MaybeAViking a sad girl. The production/art design, while beautiful, did not speak to the plot of the film at all. It did not mesh with the story, they were two separate things. Futuristic love story, set in... standard future.

Storytelling technique: This story was told all wrong. It introduces the main character in a way that does not make me relate to him, or care about his conflict. There is so little symbolism, which is what makes a great story even better in my opinion. I think the one time there was symbolism in any way, shape, or form, was when Theodore was talking to Samantha and the dead writer fella the OS's brought back to life and he gets jealous, the kettle begins to boil. I felt like patting Spike Jonze on the head for that one and giving him a gold star.

Casting: I might be biased because I hate the use and abuse of big-name actors like Joachin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson, but I think Her was poorly cast. Mainly because it's a talking heads film, and Phoenix is a mumbler. It sounds like his mustache made his mouth too heavy or something. And Johansson's voice just adds to my annoyance at this being a MPDG romance film.

C-, would not watch again. Unless it's to do that stopwatch thing."

I think it's easier to see the differences, though, in this sub than others because our tags assign gender, and it MATTERS that our tags describe gender. (Being 4'10"" as a male is vastly different than being a 4'10"" female.)

I'm 99% sure that our mom knows, but her and our dad are separated so I don't know how much they talk right now.

m00nh34d,Games,1389579167.0,"&gt; Sure, Gabe could grow an evil moustache in 2025 and Steam could go to hell, leaving a lot of people in the lurch, but SteamOS is just a layer on top of Linux, which is free and open source, so surely any existing games could then be liberated to live on outside SteamOS with minor modifications. While still unhelpful, I think developers would prefer that doomsday scenario to waking up one day and discovering that Windows XP games don't work on Windows 7.

That's really got nothing to do with Linux, or Windows. It's entirely up to the developer/owner of the game to re-jig it. 

If, in 2025, Valve does go belly up, you have no more guarantee of your games working in SteamOS, than you do Windows, or OSX. There's no added protection there, where developers can miraculously make things work outside of Steam, they're going to have to do some real work, work that takes time and money, the question would be, how many developers would be willing to go through their back catalogue to make these changes. None of that has anything to do with Valve, or the operating system which you're running Steam on.

Debido a su popularidad entre los Mexicanos dentro del territorio nacional así como en el extranjero, las imagenes de la Virgen de Guadalupe se vincula fuertemente con la identidad Mexicana.

(might have this brand in all my tanks, don't feel like looking at them ATM tho. and the ones i have are for larger tanks.) they do very well at keeping the temp consistent, and having the adjustable dial at the top was a major selling point for me. 

i would really like to suggest a larger tank for him (does he have a name yet?). i have 3 tanks, none under 10g. granted one tank doesn't have a betta in it (gouramis), but i wouldn't put a betta in anything under 15g. granted, i have the space to house tanks that size, and i know that's not an option for everyone. 

also, the milky look of the tank...i trust you rinsed the substrate a few times to get tiny particles off it? it could be that, or could be a bacterial bloom, like you think. get a test kit (they can be a bit expensive as an initial investment, but are well worth it), or most pet stores can test your water for you, sometimes for a small fee. also, 

when you do water changes, try your best to get the water you're putting back in the tank as close to the temp inside the tank as possible! you don't want to put your little guy into shock. 

i love your little bridge! i made one in my 20g with a few pieces of driftwood, and covered the top part in some java moss. maybe you could get a marimo moss ball, cut it open and lay it on the bridge? try tying it with fishing string to get it to stay. 

i can't really tell what kind of filter that is. maybe get some filter media (like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Marineland-PA0100-Filter-312-Square-Inch-Bonded/dp/B0002565PW/ref=pd_sim_petsupplies_5) - can be found really cheaply at pet supply stores -) and cut off a little piece and slide it into the filter output. that should baffle it enough to not bother him. i like doing this cause it's dirt cheap for a large pad and can be replaced easily.

sorry for the wall o' text. i'm not the most knowledgable person when it comes to tanks, but i know what's worked for me. any questions, please ask!"

&gt;Pros's of surgery are, 
&gt;Straighter spine,on how much depends as sometimes surgeons cant stretch the spine fully,so check and ask before deciding to go ahead with it,as after the age of 20 all growth has stopped so results are not as good appearance wise. 

&gt;Less pain than before,breathing improves as the ribs are straightened out and pulled away from the lungs,you will possibly be taller i have gained 5 inches since my surgery. 

&gt;clothes shopping is easier as clothes hang on you better,by that i mean your pelvis isn't tilted anymore so everything fits a lot better. 

&gt;Con's of surgery, 
&gt;Very stiff back unable to bend or even twist at the waist anymore,it takes some getting used to i had to learn how to put on shoes, and little things that many take for granted. 

&gt;Back aches in cold weather travelling problems what i mean is when i go over a bump in a car in the road its very pain-full, as fusing the spine it no longer acts as a shock absorber,this for me is the worst part of it even now 24 years after surgery i have pain when travelling. 

&gt;i have a rod in my back and can feel it at times it pinches the skin and muscle at the top if i move a certain way,but not very often but thought i would mention it to you. 

&gt;scarring i can now not wear anything that will let it be seen,and sleeping is not easy i now need 26 pillows just to get comfortable at night,i didnt get back pain at first but after a couple of years after i started to,this i am told is a side affect of spinal fusion. 

&gt;very sweaty back,what i mean is when they cut you open the cut through sweat glands,so result for me now is my back sweats like a river,it shows through my clothes like a long wide wet patch i have to change very often,i can feel it trickle i get drenched, 

[Yahoo Answers!](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100606171000AAvh9uT)

I'm sure the effects can be different from person to person for side effects but most of that I think is pretty accurate. I have scoliosis (a 19 and a 39 degree curve + some minor rotation). My doctor didn't want us to even START considering back surgery until 40 degree, and he would start pushing us to get surgery at 45 degree.

I have mild back pain almost every day. I'm pretty use to it now that it doesn't really ""bother"" me, but it's there. I wouldn't have this sugery unless your 45+ degrees and/or you have some horrible back pain. If it is effecting your quality of life, I don't see a problem with getting surgery

Try googling around for more pro's and con's of surgery! If you're really interested, definately go to a real doctor.

However, that number is deceptive. Look at the [Ending Soon](http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/ending-soon?ref=ending_soon) page and click on the projects with very low %. You'll see a lot of them are terribly set up. Ridiculous rewards structures, typos everywhere, no organization, lack of information, absurd goal for what they say they're trying to accomplish, etc. 

Projects with 0% mean they couldn't even convince family or friends to back their project, and according to the stats page, that's 10% of them. We can pretty much write those off as people who aren't even trying, which brings our total success rate up to 47% for people who got even a single backer.

I'd be very curious on what percentage of *competently designed* projects fail to fund. It would require a lot of research, unfortunately, as it would be difficult to automate most of the metrics for competence."

First, his attitude is irrelevant.  What he did was rude, certainly, but not illegal.  Were it illegal, they'd have arrested him.

He didn't fail to comply, he wanted to finish his transaction.  That's not only not unreasonable, but it's considerate of where he was.

If he had failed to comply with a lawful direction, he'd have been ticketed or arrested.  God knows those cops were looking for a reason.

Can you please show me incidents of ongoing assault at police, that would justify a callout of a further five officers to the scene of no crime?  Why would they respond as they have?

Because of the holidays and some additional expenses, I just got $70 in rewards. So that's $70 free in Gap clothing for money I would have spent anyway. I usually get around $20 in rewards per month.

The rewards are valid for I think 6 months, so you can save up quite a bit for a major purchase. And, the rewards are good across ANY Gap brand. It's the only credit card I use."

I didn't have my one niche; one thing I was *exceptionally* good at, or liked especially. There were things I liked enough, and was pretty good at, but I figured if I wanted to do something long term, I'd have to be one of the best at it, and I'd have to love it.

I felt like I would have to pick something between the 4 core classes: science, history, math, or language arts/english. I was the best at english out of all of those, but it just didn't hold on to me like I felt it should. When I was a senior in high school, I got to pick some electives to take. It was the first time I realized I could study something that wasn't one of those four. There were other things out there. I took my first Sociology class in high school and it came so easily to me. I grasped every concept, and I was so delighted to be invested in something for once. I will graduate this spring with my major in Sociology and I'm really pleased. I never want to stop being a student, and I never want to stop educating myself. Whether I am in school or not, I will always be a student learning, and hopefully teaching others. To me, there is nothing quite like the pleasure of learning and sharing that education with others."

Waitresses work for tips, so they're always friendly, especially with regulars.  Don't get your hopes up.  Do take advantage of the opportunity to practice your conversational skills and get used to talking to girls.  Talking with a friendly girl is always nice, and the fact that you have a hybrid personal/commercial relationship can take the pressure off.  Chat with her at every opportunity.  Enjoy it and benefit from the experience, but don't expect anything more.

Not that waitresses are emotionless zombies that don't have love lives, of course, but if you have any doubt about your ability to distinguish friendliness from interest — and at this point you surely do — then the odds are overwhelmingly in favor of it just being friendliness.

pstanish,FeMRADebates,1389580088.0,"Hey. I appreciate the sentiment.

I am a 23 year old guy, currently pursing PhD in chemistry in a small(ish) city in Canada. I road bike semi-competitively, call me a weekend warrior. I enjoy weight lifting and really any sport. I enjoy watching movies and TV, I just went through Community and I loved it. I am interested in all areas of science, I have studied evolutionary biology and some cosmology (maybe on a 2 year level) solo. I got into libertarian ethics/politics recently as well. I also like long walks on the beach if any was wondering...

I grew up in a liberal(isn) semi-traditional christian family, I ended up going to a private christian high school for four years. While I was there traditional christian values (more extreme than my parents) were constantly drilled into my head.

This school had it in the by-bylaws (or whatever the word might have been) that if a girl got pregnant, she would be (kindly) expelled, but if they boy who impregnated her was a student, he would not really be penalized. Many of the girls from my class were obviously upset about this. I asked why at some point and the answer was because they were more concerned about the image of the school than what actions a student makes. I still remember reading their brochures in grade 8 (before I started at tenting) where they said that if a student had problems with drugs/alcohol they would try to give help as opposed to punish them, this was not followed. So going back to gender issue behind this, I was confused, and I thought their response was reasonably sexist as well. I never really took a stand against this though, because I was reasonably passive when up against things that didn't affect me (or as t turns out non of my classmates thankfully).

The girls who spoke out most strongly against the aforementioned policy were still quite sexist themselves. That might have been part of the reason that I didn't get along with them, but given the way my memory is working now I think that may also be putting the carriage in front of the horse. I remember a few instances where I was sitting with friends for lunch along the hallway (our cafeteria sat maybe 20 people and the grade 12s tended to monopolize it) and one of these girls swatted me. I wanted her to know that this was unacceptable, so I swatted her shin back. These exchanges went of for a while, until eventually she walked by and did it to someone else saying that ""I am not going to whack pstanish today, because he is the only one that will hit a girl"". This got on my nerves, I was not being aggressive, I was certainly not being malicious, I was just trying to send a message that I was not happy with being whacked in the back of the head, yet I was the villain (I had had lots of negative experiences with telling a bully to stop, so I figured fire with fire was the most obvious way to fight it).

I would characterize my sentiments of most women as reasonably good. I attribute this partly to the fact that my mom was almost completely in control of the house growing up. That being said she taught me some extremely (I could make an argument for sexist, but I would prefer to use) bad lessons about how men and women are suppose to interact, and what constituted rape. I am not saying the ridiculous yet still somewhat grey areas, like if someone has has a single beer, I am saying that until I was reasonably old (~16) I thought I would be carted off to jail for years for asking a girl to go bowling (or really any date) if she wasn't into me. This is something that has ingrained itself into my psyche despite the fact that I know it's not true. Even to this day it still paralyzes, even with people that I know want me.

Went I was 20 I started dating (first real relationship) which I will not get into all that much. Suffice it to say that we had dramatically different views of what the future had in store, we would argue often about this she would yell so loud that she would wake her parents up and my mom could hear her downstairs when I didn't have my headphones in while we Skype'd. It took me quite a while to realize I deserved better, manly because I was only ever told how I should treat my partner, I never knew what I should expect back from her.

At about the time that this relationship ended, which was about 2 1/2 years later, my life uncle's long time (~20 years) girlfriend was suing him for ~80 % of their assets, she breached several restraining orders he had against her and selling property they were both listed on and giving him none of the money. While we were driving in my car, my (then) girlfriend said with a straight face and no stutter in her voice that if she wanted to she could get me carted away for rape, because there would be no proof that I hadn't and she would win the he-said-she-said because she was a woman. I was also taking a class in applied ethics (at one of the more liberal schools in Canada) with a professor who seemed to despise men (ironically many of his dories ended up being him doing the things that he preached not to do). It was at that point I discovered reddit and the online MRM community. For a while I enjoyed being in a supportive community (I know not all women feel that way, but as a guy, it was nice to feel like these other guys and some gals cared about me, not just because of what I could do for them) and I really enjoyed reading about it.

When this sub started I subbed (almost immediately) and enjoyed talking sharing opinions with people who may have not had the same views as me, but seemed to profess having the same goals. I originally set my flair to casual MRA/Egalitarian, but recently I shed the MRA title, because I don't think that issues can be solved by just a single side. The other contributing factor to my flair change was reading the post talking about how all the feminists here get downvoted all the time. I didn't want to be part of this stone walling brigade and I didn't want to identify with the group that was likely responsible for it.

&lt;/book&gt;

I think I more than sufficiently want the culture that I grew up in. I am currently in one of the only schools in Canada that has more men than women (thanks computer sciences/engineering) and a lot of the people that I associate with are multicultural (many people from India and Iran). There is a really interesting interplay between the cultures, because my research group has had extremely liberal and conservative members from both aforementioned countries. I would say most of the Canadian friends I made here are your typical scientist/computer scientist, making understanding their views on gender incredibly hard to discover.

I just realized that this is over 6800 characters so if you read this far thanks. You care more about me than I would care to read about myself."
flashmedallion,TrueAskReddit,1389580091.0,"Realize that every single human being on earth has *far* more in common that we do differences.

Every person going about their day and their life is more likely that not sharing the same thought processes that you are.  Yeah, we can express things wildly differently based on our experiences, our culture, our upbringing and even the way our language shapes us; but the vast majority of the processes in our heads are the same.

I feel the biggest cure for cynicism is a practiced empathy.  Make it a habit, and you'll find the cynicism actually fades as you grow older.  People who get old and cynical are the ones who keep reinforcing the opposite - usually to ward off damage to their ego on some level."

grisoeil,videos,1389580208.0,"I think you're right, but we should also consider that it's double fucking hard to be cool and charismatic in a language you're not so familiar with. 

Yes, he *speaks* lots of languages but he also stumbles a lot and you can see how most languages really take a big toll on him (sustaining a conversation in a language you don't know that well yet is a bit like operating numbers in your head: you can do it but it's fucking tiring). If you watch him speak Spanish in [that previous vid(first minutes)](http://youtu.be/1Cb7SwrDRSE), he's cool while he's saying next to nothing and ordering bread but by the time he's leaving and wants to ask some more complex questions he just can't make it anymore. He's probably feeling *language exhaustion* I guess. Being charismatic isn't easy in that case.

As far as I understand he's trying to learn a lot of languages without really getting close and personal to (most of) them, and that's ok; I'm in no way trying to belittle his work and tremendous will power. I just wanted to give some perspective to people who are new to the field and come here thinking this guy must be using black magic. (well he is! :-)). 

I guess some of the commenters here did not realize that although he can chit chat a few sentences in many languages, he cannot express complex thoughts in as many languages. The average person can do the same if he/she is inclined to invest 4-6 months on average for each language. It doesn't take much more than that to reach a basic, talk about the weather level.

Not only are you beating a strawman but you're trying to shoehorn a nation built on $17 trillion dollars worth of stolen labor, blood and death to ""backwards hillbillies"". What the FUCK are they teaching you kids in school because it aint fucking history. And centuries ago? Slavery technically ended in 1863 and only officially ended in 1942. Anti black oppression continued to extremes until 1967. The last lynching took place in 1982.  Anti-black racism is still pervasive to this day.

Wow.

Yeah, I'm gonna back away from this one. Everything you said is just so unsettling and incorrect and I suspect its not even your fault. And your concern is that I might not be carefully sorting racist white people from non-racist white people? Of course."

I had depression for years and it wasn't until I did a complete 180 on my life that things changed. That's the problem with people who claim to want to lose weight but don't. They say they're trying, but then they go and drink that 400 calorie soda in secret. There's such a thing as giving half ass attempts. Most people who try to overcome depression, for example, sit in the therapists office once a week for an hour and that's it. Sure, you're not giving up then... but what is that doing for you? I did that for years and nothing happened. 

When you're overcoming obesity/addiction/depression it has to become your life. If you half ass it you might as well not be trying. What's the point of going to therapy if afterwards you're going to go home and watch Netflix for the next 10 hours? What's the point of eating that salad for lunch if you're just going to have 3 cheeseburgers and a milkshake for dinner? I don't think most people say that they're giving up because most people don't want to admit that. That doesn't mean they're trying either.

I have no hope of finding a lasting relationship on OkCupid anymore, but I'm more confident/likely to go ask out a woman in person now.  I still message a few women online from time to time in case one of them wisens up and takes a chance, but I think the old fashioned way is going to be the way to go.  So, don't kill yourself, and keep in mind that eventually you can also see your online dating time as experience instead of wasted time.

If you continue to make the same amount of trash weekly, you'll have to go up a container size and you'll pay more.  If you continue to produce the same amount of trash and you don't need to go up a container size, then you'd have seen better benefits by switching to a smaller size, anyway.

It's a total crock to say that there will be a cost savings.  In none of those situations are savings improved for people over optimizing using today's weekly pickup system.

lordfuzzywig,WTF,1389580909.0,"That's a good question. There are lots of ways. In no particular order:

-Smuggling through visits (visitor brings it wrapped heavily in their rectum etc.), AKA keistering.  
-Thrown over the walls. Occasionally full firearms have been found this way. Very common, very easy. We have lots of perimeter patrols and towers for this though, and they're very thorough.  
-Corrupt officers. It's tougher for cops to bring stuff in, but far from impossible.  
-Numerous other ways. Sometimes it's not real ammo, per se. That is to say it's not what you would think of (ie gunpowder, primer, etc.) but just a metal ball that gets ""thrown"" rapidly. Much less deadly, but still dangerous as hell.

EDIT: I saw a fully functional (and incredibly accurate and powerful) blow-gun with nails as ammo. It penetrated skin easily. Inmates will occasionally dip their weapons in foeces to make them more dangerous/deadly, so any weapon that penetrates an inch or so (like that blowgun) was a huge deal."

whyamisosoftinthemid,todayilearned,1389580922.0,"My understanding of the intent of ""external debt"" was that it reflected debt that crossed an international boundary.  If so, then for every bit of debt owed by one country (as a whole), that bit would be owed to some other country, and therefore could be argued to be ""negative debt"".  My point is that we see no such negative numbers in this accounting, so this must not be including that second aspect here.

To illustrate, if the USA owed parties in Canada $1M, and Canada owed parties in the USA $1M (let's not quibble over currencies), then both countries would show up here as having $1M in ""external debt"", rather than them canceling each other out."

And that gives me some hope that one day I might meet someone like that. I am a first generation student.... I don't want for myself what I see in my family (the poverty, substance abuse, lots of kids without dads, general instability). I have a lot of respect for anyone who is trying to better themself. 

You're right - its really hard to just be a person. No matter who you are and no matter which way you turn there is someone telling you that you're too much or not enough of whatever. Its really easy for these people to have power over you, especially as their numbers increase or as their ridiculous opinions impact your ability to succeed. :( I personally hate that the presentation of our bodies matters so much, but you're also right in that there are things we must do to get what we want out of life. We may not like them, but if there is something else we want more, then we must capitulate. 

Men do not really get many compliments? Maybe that is something we should work on as people as well. O_O I am always afraid they will think I am hitting on them -  I am already a very friendly/touchy kind of person. XD

Colonization is a very complicated topic... but I think its less ""acting/dressing like white people"" and more about all the subtle ways that  a people and their culture and traditions are erased and replaced with the ""colonizing"" culture. Socially accepted appearance and personality are just one facet (and usually the ones people choose to rebel with first because they are an easy in to personal empowerment). Like the rejection of traditional medicines and healing practices. Granted, some of them are trash and don't really help (or can even hurt) but the flat out rejection of all of them without solid scientific evidence showing that they are hogwash is an example of colonization. That a lot of people will look at me like I'm retarded  when I tell them to drink ginger tea for an upset stomach is an example (and sad because ginger has well documented effects). Or, as a Christian, if you ask for time off of work for religious rites (I knew a Mormon once who got every Sat/Sun off in retail no less), you're pretty much going to get it... but even if I worked any schedule, as many hours as my boss wanted and was an exceptional employee, if I were to ask for a while off of work to go have a spiritual journey in the wilderness, it would be a fight to get what I wanted. I know because I have tried when I was younger. And the fact that such a thing would cost a lot of money (in terms of losing work hours, buying supplies since the water is no longer safe to drink, etc) is a function of colonialism. As is that I cannot do such a thing when I feel called, I have to wait till its ""appropriate"" and or plan it."

* **Is she in the mood to be alone?** Men need to fuck off and leave girls alone.

* **Is she feeling unloved?** Men need to be more romantic.

* **Is she feeling horny?** Men need to just grow some balls and fuck me already.

* **Is she feeling like an underachiever?** Men need to end their persecution and let more women into grown-up jobs.

* **Is she feeling confident about her job performance?** Men need to pick up the slack and be strong like us wimmin!

That's why their rallying cries are so contradictory, so disparate, so chaotic. There is no underlying plan, no reasoned analysis of actions and their consequences. It's all based on achieving the short-term goal of satisfying her feelings.

That's why the one thing a woman truly requires is the steely discipline of a man who creates order in her life. It's why most women need (and indeed wish, secretly) to submit to men - they have no focus and no reason of their own."

""This is unacceptable. I told you once, and that should be enough.""

She hangs her head, bangs hiding her eyes from his stern gaze, so he doesn't notice when she rolls them at him. Whatever. He'll yell for a while, then send her to bed without any real consequences.

""Bend over,"" he orders.

Her head snaps up, a shocked expression meeting his impassive one.

""Wha...But...""

""Quiet!"" he shouts, cutting her off. ""The only 'but' around here is the one that's about to get spanked.""

Trembling, she turns, presenting her backside to him. The hem of her plain white dress hangs down just below her ass, and it creeps up a bit when she bends. He tugs it up roughly, exposing her bare backside.

""No panties?!"" he roars, then quiets. ""You little slut.""

**THWACK.**

The first hit is jarring. She can't believe the pain.

**THWACK.**

The second hit is blinding. Her mind can't process anything but the stinging on her ass.

**THWACK.**

The third hit is...she can't say. She won't. Oh, god...

**THWACK.**

His hand...so powerful. So close to her sex. With each spank, she feels her pussy getting wetter. Fuck, this is so embarrassing...she prays he doesn't notice.

The blows stop and he pushes her to her feet.

""Go to bed.""

She stumbles away, looking back at him, bleary-eyed, before turning to head for the stairs. Then she pauses, and without looking at him again, she pulls the dress over her head. Behind her, there is a groan. She folds it neatly, then starts up the spiral staircase.

funkalunatic,OneY,1389581168.0,"So everybody understands that articles like these are poison, right? To paraphrase:

0) Women are emotionally/socially intelligent and men are technically intelligent. These traits define masculinity and femininity.

1) Men built the technology of the information age with their technical intelligence.

2) The technology of the information age has shifted the job landscape to emphasize emotional/social intelligence more.

3) Men are doing poorly in the information age because they lack sufficient emotional/social intelligence.

4) These problems can only be solved if men accept blame for them for having created them in the first place, and then become more feminine, which is the same as becoming more emotionally/socially intelligent.

It is remarkable that **not one of these points is true.** Not just that, but **they reinforce sexist notions of masculinity that harm both men *and* women.** Many young men growing up in recent decades have been taught to suppress pro-social inclinations and behave anti-socially in the name of masculinity. Many young women have been taught that technical pursuits are un-feminine. As a result, while women may be getting more college degrees, they are still in the slim minority in high-paying, cutting edge technical fields.

The article writer believes that people are blaming feminists for the travails of men. Whatever. If she is such a feminist, then why is she writing stereotypical sexist horseshit like this?"

Her name was Jennifer; her Mother rented a couple of rooms from an old couple across the street.

I think I was about...5? 6? when I first met her or so. She had this beautiful Irish heritage, her skin was the perfect shade of pale, with ample freckles and auburn hair that was not totally straight.

She was 2 years older than me but we hung out a lot because there were not many kids on my block (very wealthy area, small ""private"" drive, lots of very large homes not that many kids). 

She is the first girl I ever played ""doctor"" with ; the first girl I ""kissed"". Really for about two years she was my best friend before her mother decided to move away.

While not exclusively attracted to ""Irish"" looking girls with red hair, I have always had a preference to women with light skin, freckles and red hair. Oddly enough I have always had a preference for older women as well though that I attribute to always being mature for my age and seeking the same.



Edit:

Thinking about this more MAJOR FREAKIN TRIGGER WARNING

She knew wayyyy to much about sex at her age and she always seemed really eager to do those types of things; she was way into what I would call as an adult ""roleplay"" but then again I suppose most kids are.

Be polite but firm and consistent, if she phones then cut her off and tell her to email if it is important.

It was so weird, seeing her teacher outside of school. She wasn't stupid, of course. She knew that teachers were normal people and had normal lives. But still. She hadn't ever seen one of her teachers at the mall before.

There she was, though - and not just shopping, but shopping for lingerie. The girl stared as the voluptuous blonde woman walked around the store, picking up lacy undergarments designed to fit curves that the high school student couldn't imagine ever having.

As she followed her teacher to the back of the store, she told herself that is was just curiosity that was driving her. If she hadn't thought about her teachers having lives outside of the school building, she certainly hadn't thought about any of them wearing sexy underwear. Now, though, her eagerness to see Ms Peach try on the skimpy pieces she'd been carrying was overwhelming.

""Could I have some help?"" Ms Peach's voice was clear and strong, just like it was in the classroom.

The changing room attendant was gone. Nobody was responding to the woman's request. Heart racing, the girl felt herself step towards her teacher's door and raising a hand to knock on it. The door opened before she could.

""I just need - Oh!"" her teacher began, seemingly just as surprised to see a student in this context. ""I didn't know you worked here.""

""I...I don't,"" was the whispered reply. ""I just saw you and...and I wanted...""

What did she want? She wasn't sure exactly, but she knew that what she wanted was in that changing room."

codayus,feedthebeast,1389581336.0,"In the ""old"" days (eg, in the original Mindcrack pack), there were two big tech ecosytems:

* BC/TE:  Pretty easy to construct, did lots of stuff.  
* IC2:  Slightly harder to construct (mostly due to the need for rubber), but had armour and tools  
* Gregtech (optional):  Made IC2 much much harder, *but* added a bunch of fancy machines (centrifuges, fusion reactors).

In short, BC and IC2 were broadly balanced without GT, and some people would add GT because they loved the endgame, and felt like that was still a balanced tradeoff.  Now, there have been a lot of changes since then, but most of them involve ways of doing stuff you used to need IC2 for without IC2.  For example:

* MPS gives you awesome armour without IC2
* TCon gives you awesome tools without IC2
* RotaryCraft is starting to fill the ""crazy power system and insane machines"" niche, again without IC2.

Meanwhile, the BC ecosystem didn't really get any more expensive.  That made IC2 go from broadly balanced (a bit more expensive but hey, nanoarmour and mining lasers) to unbalanced.

So that's where we stand not counting the experimental IC2 builds.  Clearly what IC2 needs is to either add some compelling features the BC ecosytem can't match *or* drop the ""cost"" (in materials or time) of the IC2 ecosystem.

What they're doing is *raising* the cost.  In a modern pack like Monster there is:

1. Nothing you can do with IC2 that you can't do with a MJ/RF based mod
2. Nothing you can do with IC2 that isn't much more expensive than it would be with a MJ/RF mod.
3. Nothing you can do with IC2 that isn't more expensive than it was in earlier version of IC2.

The entire project is rebalancing towards being slower, more complicated, and more expensive.  Which is *fine*!  I loved the old GregTech mod, which did just that, but GregTech always had a big payoff for putting up with the difficulty.  IC2, as of right now, does not.  I recently crafted a full set of nanoarmour using a recent IC2 experimental build and it's just *stupidly* expensive; sucking up vast quantities of resources (diamonds, copper, rubber, EU, etc.) and using a complex series of crafting steps for...some armour which isn't all that amazing.

TL;DR:  IC2 is a perfectly fine mod in and of itself.  But in an FTB modpack it exists as part of a larger ecosystem, and it's having its clock cleaned by TE, TCon, EnderIO, Railcraft, MPS, and friends.  Mods offer a sort of contract to the user:  Put in the time and resources to master me and I'll make it worth your while.  They might do something that no other mod does, or do it a bit cheaper, or let you make your base look awesome, or have a really nice vibe.  IC2 doesn't.  You go to the trouble of crafting all the IC2 stuff and you get...some IC2 stuff.  And people who sunk all that time and resources into IC2 end up peeved wondering where they payoff is."

**Warning: Gangbang** (does that need a warning?)

---

She'd warned him. She'd tried to be clear. It hadn't worked, and now their relationship was over.

He just hadn't understood that when she'd said ""The more cock, the better,"" she hadn't been complimenting the size of his member. She hadn't been telling him how much or how often she wanted to have sex with him, either.

That's not to say that those things weren't true - his cock was rather impressive, and she did love fucking him a lot. It's just that she went out of her way to create opportunities for his friends to walk in on them.

But sometimes, she wanted more. That afternoon, she'd come over while the guys were watching the game. Bored to tears, she decided to spice things up. She thought he would appreciate her willingness to suck him off in the middle of the living room, in front of all of his friends.

""What the hell is wrong with you?"" he'd yelled, pushing her away and zipping up his pants. ""You don't have to act like a slut all the time.""

""Oh, so I'm a slut just because I love cock?""

He'd just huffed and rolled his eyes at her. ""You know what, fuck you,"" she'd said, moving away from him. ""If god wanted girls to be monogamous, he wouldn't have given us three holes.""

She looked around the room at the rest of the guys.

""I want you to cum inside me,"" she whispered.

Fuck. His cock throbbed even harder, and he felt his orgasm nearing. ""No. Oh, god, no, I can't!"" 

""Why not?"" she pouted. ""Don't you love me?""

""Fuck, baby, of course I love you! But you know I can't cum inside you! What if..."" 

""Please!"" she cut him off. ""I want your creamy jizz deep inside my pussy, filling me up. I want you to squirt your dirty semen in my belly and make me pregnant!""

Shit. As wrong as it was, that's exactly what he wanted, too. The realization that she wanted his baby sent him over the edge, and he grunted loudly, his balls spewing thick globs into her tight, wet cunt.

She felt his cock pulsate, sensed his seed entering her body, and quivered as her own orgasm took her. The pair came together, holding each other tight as he deposited his load at the entrance to her fertile womb.

Their frenzied thrusting slowed, but his cock did not relax.

""Fuck. That was so wrong, but I don't care.""

""Give me more,"" she whispered. ""I want to be certain. Fuck me all night, keep pounding my tight pussy and fill me with so much cum that it spills out of me around your shaft.""

With that, she rolled on top of him, clenched her pussy tighter on his cock, and began to ride."

I know cis women who don't wear pants due to their gender identities.  Mostly, they're femmes, but that label doesn't really matter to this argument. i know someone (a cis femme) who would be completely appalled to the point of panic attacks to be forced to wear men's jeans (or probably any jeans).  
Sorry, but this is a terribly cissexist track to go down. Of course trans people say gender binarist things to explain their being trans --this wouldn't happen if no one had to explain why they are trans!  and in the meantime, if asked, most cis people would have nothing intelligent to say about why they are the genders they are, and they easily point to body parts or childhood hobbies as where their genders are coming from. But who ever goes after them for it?

and this question is hardly ever phrased to impact trans men and how they describe their genders and what's comfortable.  it's a load of bullshit.  

gender roles are shitty and we should dismantle them.  systemically. we should not blame individual people for systems we all are responsible for.

You've always preferred sleeping in the nude - you're just more comfortable that way. You certainly never expected it would result in something like *this.*

At first you think you're just having the most incredible dream ever. You've had sexual dreams before, but nothing so intense as this. One minute, you're having the most boring dream ever - taking orders over the phone at the pizza place where you worked back when you were in high school - when suddenly SHE walked into the restaurant, threw you down on a table, and pulled out your cock.

In your dream, her mouth wrapped around you, sucking the top few inches of your cock, while her hand squeezed the base of your shaft. Getting a blowjob from your dream girl - what could be better?

Reality, that's what.

As her expert mouth pleasures your huge cock, the feeling becomes too intense, and you feel yourself awaken - but the warmth, wet mouth is still there. Your eyes pop open, and you almost scream. There, crouching over you, is *me* - your little sister's best friend Nicole. I grin at you, mouth full of your dick, and laugh at your wide eyes.

You go to scream, but I shush you before sliding my mouth back down your shaft. Your eyes go from my naked tits to my ass, peeking out under my school uniform, then back to my eyes, wide with desire as I take your cockhead into my throat. All at once you lose control, bucking your hips a bit as you empty your balls into me."

She took a deep breath, holding back the tears, and opened the door quietly. Hopefully, the rest of the family would be asleep.

No such luck. Her older brother was sitting on the couch, and turned towards her as she entered.

""Hey, you're home early,"" he commented casually. ""

""Yeah,"" she replied, unable to keep her voice from cracking. Her brother sat up straighter and looked at her. She glanced sideways at him, surprised by the warmth and tenderness she saw there.

""Hey - are you okay?"" he asked, walking over to her. She began to retreat for the stairs but he grabbed her arm and pulled her back. She turned back and crumpled into his arms, bawling.

""That asshole!"" she sobbed. Fuck. She'd told herself she wouldn't cry, that he wasn't worth it, but she couldn't help it.

""Forget about him,"" he said soothingly, rubbing her hair and her back. ""What can I do to help?""

She hugged him back, holding her body tightly against his. Then...well, she wasn't sure what made her do it, but she found her hands sliding down to his ass. He jumped a little, then laughed and gave her a playful swat on her own butt. When she squeezed his tight backside, he froze, realizing that she wasn't joking in the same way he had been.

""Uh...sis?"" he asked uncertainly.

""I just need to feel something right now. I need to feel something to make me forget him.""

He stared down at his beautiful sister, mascara smeared around her tear-filled eyes. She couldn't mean what it sounded like she meant, could she?

""Please, bro. I want to feel your hard cock inside me. Fuck me and make me forget how shitty other guys are."""

Then they have a kid and the usual parents dying, blah blah justice blah blah vengeance. Bruce does his global studying and training montage comes back to find his company in need of recovery since he just left it. There could also be a mysterious flow of funds here by an employee named Edward Nigma or a scientist named Dr.Freis. Bruce figures it out and fires them, making them angry, determined, and vengeful. He revitalizes it and makes it better than ever, making him richer and a lot more resources. Then it's the usual process of the first night out and then seeing the bat, and finally becoming Batman. All the while, his parents were religious Muslims, while he's only somewhat religious.

But the whole thing's in the early stages, and really it's just a load of ideas floating around at the moment. As a guitarist and nothing else, I'm  hoping to form a band so I can collaborate, help merge my ideas with others' and bring them to completion.

I guess I was just wanting feedback on the inherent pleasantness of the passage. Is it OK to listen to, while avoiding too many chart-music clichés? I'm hoping to avoid something which just screams *generic three chords and overly-basic melody*, but I can never critically evaluate my own work. I'm just wondering if the chords and melody seem reasonable at this stage? I'm well aware it could do with a bit of work, but I'm not sure where exactly..."

""How will we know if it worked?"" Gina asked nervously, staring at the pink vibrator.

""It will work,"" Kyla snapped. ""Are you doubting me?""

""N-no..."" Gina stammered. ""I...I just...it still seems impossible.""

""Well, you're a stupid little girl,"" Kyla said with a smirk. ""What do you know?""

Ever since Kyla had found out about Gina's crush on her boyfriend, she had been lording it over her friend. Gina had been mortified that Kyla knew - after all, Kyla's boyfriend was Gina's own brother!

""Get back to work, bitch!"" Kyla yelled to her friend. ""I'm doing you a big favor here, and I expect to be paid back.

Wordlessly, Gina returned her mouth to Kyla's wet pussy. Kyla ground her clit against Gina's tongue as she worked the spell, the sexual energy of the two girls fueling the magic. Gina's fingers worked deep inside of Kyla's folds as she sucked on the smooth labia, then slid back to tongue her friend's clit.

Kyla's orgasm hit her hard, and literal sparks flew through the room. When she collapsed on the bed beside her friend, the pink fuck toy in her hand was glowing slightly.

""Oh my god. I totally worked, didn't it?"" Gina said excitedly. Kyla just grinned stupidly in post-orgasmic bliss.

Gina took the toy, giving it a tentative squeeze, then stroking it. She heard a surprised groan from the next room. Kyla jumped up to join her, the pair now licking both sides of the vibrator together. Through the walls, they could hear Gina's brother gasping with surprise and pleasure as he felt two young mouths on his cock.

""Are you ready?"" Kyla asked. ""Are you ready to fuck your brother's voodoo cock?"""

Should be more or less carbonated, and then fine tuned over the next couple weeks as needed.

If you want to go the priming route, there are a lot of factors at play. Namely how much beer you have and how much sugar you add. Try to take as exact measurements as possible. I go by 500mls for the beer and by the gram for the sugar. Depending on how long it has been in secondary it might be useful to repitch yeast. Same with if the abv is really high.

If only there was a quick fix for this.  I know, we'll move in/get married/have kids!  That'll fix the problem for sure!""

Without trying to sound like a pretentious douche, looking for the ""quick fix"" in a relationship is a sign of emotional insecurity.  If you've been together for a while, you need to work constantly at a relationship.  Get couples' therapy, talk things over, compromise.  If one or both of you isn't willing to work hard to keep a relationship strong, it isn't going to work.  A piece of paper and a ring isn't going to fix it, and the strain of a new baby will most likely make things worse.

What this woman did was extra foolish.  Not only did she have a baby to try to save a relationship, it seems she did so without even consulting him.  When both parties are naive enough to believe a child/marriage will fix things, that's bad enough.  When one party tries to trap the other, it's even worse.  I have no sympathy for the woman; it all goes to the kid."

I was really petite and my boobs seemed huge(though they weren't since I was a 30D), but at the age of 14 I started taking lots of medication for anxiety and some other mental illnesses and that made me put on a lot of weight(25kgs or 55lbs) in a span of 6 months. My body changed a lot, particularly my hips and butt(got a big booty practically overnight, which has stayed even though I've dropped like 10kgs/22lbs since).

At 17 I got pregnant so my body changed once again, mostly my breasts and once again, my hips. I went from a 30D to a 30HH and now a 30E since I stopped breastfeeding. I'm turning 19 next month and things haven't changed since having my baby so I'm pretty sure this is it, though it could change, since I still have to drop some kgs(goal weight for me is 48-52kgs, so 105-115lbs, since I'm so short)."

celiviel,Team_Japanese,1389581983.0,"I think I learned a lot from last year's resolution, which was to exercise regularly. I succeeded, averaging 134 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week, even with almost six weeks off to recover from an injury.

After some trial and error, I discovered that what works best for me was to set goals that reflected an overall sustainable pace and not try to micromanage my day-to-day too much. For example, my current exercise goal is to burn a minimum of 3500 calories through exercise every 28 days, or 875 calories every week. How I get to that weekly goal varies. Some weeks it's more frequent, lighter workouts. Some weeks it's a couple of really intense workouts (or more, if I need to catch back up from a previous week). Yoga, running, bicycling, weight training...whatever I feel like my body needs and will fit with my schedule. There are lots of people who work out much more intensely, but this is a pace that I can sustain and often exceed, so I feel good about myself rather than beating myself up about skipping any given day.

So for Japanese, I've done the same thing. Finish a Genki chapter (including all workbook exercises and learning vocab in Anki) and 3/4 of a TextFugu season every month, so that I'll be done with both by the end of the year. Lots of people have more ambitious goals than this, but I don't want to sprint at the start and then hit a wall and quit. I figure as long as I'm making forward progress, even if it's at a relatively slow pace, then it's impossible for me not to eventually become fluent.

The other thing is of course to log everything I do, to hold myself accountable for maintaining the pace. That's why I joined Team Japanese!"

He hadn't meant to stare. But, dear god, he was glad he did.

Five minutes before, he'd stepped out into the communal courtyard of his apartment complex, planning to head to the store. This early on a Saturday morning, it was no surprise that the courtyard was empty.

Empty at first, anyway. He caught a flash of pink at a distance as she rounded the corner, and his brief glance quickly turned to a stare. She was *gorgeous,* and the pink dress she was wearing looked amazing on her. She walked closer to him, oblivious to his attention.

Well, walked wasn't the right word. She had headphones in, and she was dancing as she made her way down the path. It was a dance made awkward by the laundry basket in her arms, but it was still captivating. As she drew closer, he noted that the basket wasn't the only evidence that it was laundry day; her nipples pressed out through the fabric, obviously lacking a bra, and the bottom of the dress bounced up occasionally, flashing a bare ass with not even a thong.

When she caught him staring, she stopped in her tracks. He tried to act like he was looking at something else, but really, there was nothing else to look at. He was red-handed.

A sly grin spread across her face, and she winked as she set the basket down, still dancing to the music. She was excited to have an audience, and he was excited to be one."

**Warnings: Incest, Ageplay, Impregnation**

It just wasn't fair! Ever since she'd gotten her period, Daddy had refused to cum in her pussy anymore. That had been her favorite part!

Sure, she loved it when his thick cock spread the swollen lips of her pussy and slid inside of her. She loved the way he filled her little body, the way he throbbed inside of her. She loved it when her ass slapped against him as he thrust into her over and over again, her tiny cunt squeezing her daddy's big dick. But more than that, she'd loved the way it felt to have a fresh load of Daddy's cum inside her, oozing out of her freshly-fucked twat all day long at school.

This morning, Daddy had stopped her just before she left for the school bus. She'd known he would - she was wearing his favorite skirt of hers. What she hadn't expected was how eager he'd be - he'd torn her tights open in his rush to get to his daughter's pussy! He'd fucked her so good, and she'd cum hard on his wonderful cock, but then he'd pulled out of her, thrusting between her ass cheeks as he came, spraying her back with his thick daddycum. Her whimper was a mix of satisfaction at her orgasm and disappointment at where he'd left his load. ""Sorry, babygirl,"" he said. ""I made you miss your bus, too. Go ahead and get changed and I'll drive you to school.""

Sudden resolve took her. Her head still down, she locked eyes with her Daddy, scooped some of his cum off of her back, and pressed it into her moist fuckhole.

""What are you...you could get pregnant!"" he yelled at her, pulling her wrist away.

""But that's what I *want,* Daddy! I want your baby inside of me so much!""

That froze him where he stood. His cock, which had been slowly softening, was suddenly back to attention.

""See? You want that too, don't you? How about you make me late for school and put a baby in me the right way instead?"""

omegasavant,TrueAskReddit,1389582429.0,"Don't watch cable news. It's yellow journalism for the modern era. Cable news features human misery, human cruelty, and human stupidity. Outrage and fear sell. Happy stories do not.

Keep in mind that bad things are more noticeable than good things. There are no news headlines saying ""Infant mortality slowly decreasing over last few centuries"". Or ""Small step taken to cure this specific type of breast cancer."" Cause that's not an event. It's progress. Likewise, you're going to pay more attention to that one guy making an ass of himself than the other 99.9% of people acting civilized. This is only natural, but don't forget that these are there.

Read more about the sciences. This is where human progress comes to the fore. If nothing else, remember this. Our society has reached such a height that we can have people seeking knowledge for the sake of knowledge. And we, as human beings, can put aside base urges in order to learn and explore.

Read more history. Yes, really. And compare that to our current condition. We live better now than ever before. It's not a mild improvement, either. A working class person today lives better than an ancient king. Infant mortality used to be so high that it dropped average life expectancy to 40. An ear infection used to be a death sentence. We used to think that draining people's blood would improve their health. We used to think that women's uteruses bounced around, smooshing their organs. (Yes, really.). Hell, we used to believe that women were imperfectly constructed men, that other races were inherently animalistic, that the lower classes were just naturally slavey. We believe now that humans are equal, and all deserve certain rights. We take that for granted now, but it's a very new idea. Do you realize that right now, slavery is illegal everywhere on the planet? The Romans saw a world without slavery as a mythical Golden Age, a long-lost utopia. Did you know that 84% of adults can read now? That's insane. Literacy used to be a skill of the elite. Education was granted to very few people. And now we plan, realistically, to make every single person literate. In my country, at least, the government gives free education to everyone for twelve years. And that's not at all uncommon. Such an idea would have seemed absurd to someone living a few hundred years ago. Also: violence, war, and general crime are at their lowest rates *ever*. Bask in the glow of this paradise that we've crafted for ourselves.

I don't mean to say that our problems are meaningless because other people suffered more. Those sorts of pissing contests do nothing but make miserable people feel guilty for not being quite miserable enough. What I mean is that we, as humans, have gotten better. We've chosen to participate in this grand experiment, to cooperate in a society, to not kill or harm other human beings. It's not out of fear of punishment, either. If the government shut down tomorrow, would you run off to rape or kill someone? Probably not. Most people have an inherent sense of right and wrong. There's something about human nature that makes most people act decently. "

eowyn_,tall,1389582500.0,"What you need to do... well, here, take a tank top  pattern.  It's pretty easy, just two pattern pieces not counting binding.  Many patterns will mark the bust point (the fullest part of the girls).  So what you do is measure from where your shoulder seam will be (in American patterns, that's 5/8 of an inch down from where you cut) down to the bust point.  And measure from the middle of the top of your shoulder down to YOUR bust point.  Now see if they match.  If they don't (and they won't if you're six feet tall!), what you need to do is draw a line on your pattern that is UNDER the armhole and OVER the bust point on the pattern.  You don't want to draw through the armholes 'cause they're a pain in the butt to adjust.  

Now, cut right along that line you just drew.  Take some paper and put it under your pattern pieces.  Take the shoulder half of the pattern and tape it to the top of your paper.  Now, say your shoulder-bust point measurement is two inches longer than the pattern's.  What you'd do is draw a line two inches under the top half of your pattern.  Then you tape the top of the bottom of your pattern to that line.  Make sure you got the sides lined up!  Now your tank top has two more inches in the bust, but you haven't changed any of the width or anything, and the shape is still the same.  You can do this for anything where you need length all across the pattern piece.  It's called slash and spread.  I hope that made sense!

I'm starting to think I have a really poor image of myself, because I've been working on slimming down my midsection and, despite losing 5lbs in the past 2 weeks, I still feel very unhappy with my body.

My asthma is currently well controlled enough during my ""bad"" season AND with a sinus/respiratory infection that my dr. and I decided to see how controlled I can be a category B medication that is in one of my category C's...while eliminating another category C.  I'm nervous because I've been well controlled on the combination I was on for the last 5 years.  It's a balance between baby and breathing.  If I go downhill, I'm supposed to call her and we'll discuss the possibility of higher dosages or going back to the Cs.  I'm honestly OK either way, because if I stop breathing neither one of us is going to be in a good place.

stick_it_in_your_bum,relationships,1389582744.0,"&gt;Do you have any advice on how to grow as an individual in a serious live-in relationship?

It is a good to spend time away from your partner doing your own thing. Whether you want to spend it with your friends, or exploring your passions, time apart can strengthen your relationship in the right context. However, this could be tough to accomplish, because of feelings of longing that might come from your partner. I think that if you remain in the relationship, then it will take more time to finish soul searching. But if you stay in the relationship you will not have any regrets, because you will definitely figure out if you're with the right guy. Personally, I think this is the way to go, but don't let my opinion sway you. The healthier option might be to break things off. You have to ask yourself, is finding out who you really are more important, or is the relationship? Or is there some sort of a medium between the two that could work?

&gt;Or any advice on how to recognize when it's time to let go?

Realizing when to let go is one of the most difficult things to do in a relationship. If you've been in a serious relationship that has been ongoing for years, then you've build up a lot of trust, and have formed a strong bond over many shared experiences. This is precisely why it's difficult to break it off. I think that in the best case scenario you have to end a relationship when you realize that you don't stand to gain anything from it. It might sound selfish, but there's really no reason to be in a relationship if you're not happy when you're with your partner; when you think that your partner is standing in your way, or if you simply think that life without them would be a lot better.

1. New/nice. My nice clothes aren't always brand new, as I do a lot of thrifting for my wardrobe, but these are the things I wear for work/going out/being seen in public.

2. House clothes. This includes workout gear, and clothes that I wear just lounging around the house. Pajama bottoms, t-shirts, a lot of band tees. Some shirts that are comfortable but getting too roughed up for work fall into this category. Would still answer the door in these, or loaf around with friends.

3. Grubby clothes. I always have a pair of sweats and a few tees/sweatshirts I wear when I'm painting or working around the house. When I'm painting I get everything everywhere anyway, so I keep these around to preserve my other clothes. Really only worn for messy projects.

Nice clothes that I lose a taste for but are still in good shape, go to Goodwill. Same with house clothes. If they're just something I'm not wearing anymore (for whatever reason) but not stained or damaged, goodwill. House clothes may be degraded to grubby clothes after one too many projects. Grubby clothes are the last stage of wearability, and one step above garbage/rags. Although my current painting clothes are 10 years old or so, so it takes a while for these to be scrubby enough to be rags.

mintyJulips,AskWomen,1389582887.0,"I don't think this is a problem if it coming from a place of being more attracted to personalities. A good personality can make a person exponentially more attractive, while a bad one can have the reverse effect. When it comes to a relationship, my standards for appearance are pretty low (don't be obese, have good hygiene). I still have a 'type' that I'm more attracted to, but I don't expect to find someone that matches that description AND who I have great chemistry/a connection with. That's just being realistic. 

I think your lack of preference *is* a problem if it's coming from a place of 'I don't deserve anything special', because it shows an obvious self esteem issue that needs to be addressed. It also doesn't bode well for the longevity of a relationship. If you look at your partner and think, 'I don't deserve someone more attractive', then their appearance plays directly into your low self esteem spiral. And, holy shitsnacks, I wouldn't want my SO looking at me and having that thought. Sooner or later, you are going to come to resent your SO or you are going to get over your self esteem issue and your eyes will start to wander. 

So...I think you need to determine where this feeling is coming from to determine if it's a personal issue you need to work on or if it's just your mode of attraction. "

You said that his comment didn't answer your question. I showed how it did. Whether or not he responded to all of the replies he got is irrelevant. Besides, can you blame him? Just think about how much time our argument has taken. He has more important things to do than argue with hundreds of people, like being a reddit admin.

&gt;Oh I'm sure there is a correlation with popularity. That doesn't disprove brigading. 

Have you forgotten the quote I gave you where he said very few SRSters brigade? Seriously man, do you have short term memory loss or soemthing?

&gt;Why is it other subs get banned for that behavior but not SRS?

FUCKING. READ. He says that very few SRS users actually brigade, so there's no need to ban them.

&gt;Why are SRSers allowed to have sockpuppet accounts?

Anyone can have a sockpuppet account. Determining whether an account is a sockpuppet or not can only be done by a human. There are millions of sockpuppet accounts, and 15 reddit admins. Besides, there's no actual evidence that SRSters vote on sockpuppet accounts, just anecdotal evidence, which isn't worth shit.

&gt;If SRS doesn't brigade, why do they have so many announcements reminding people to not brigade?

So that newcomers don't do it. If there were no announcements and just one obscure link in the sidebar, newcomers would start voting on linked threads, and then SRS *would* be a vote brigade, and would be banned. The SRS mods don't want that to happen, so they make sure there is no way you can miss the ""don't touch the poop"" rule.

&gt;They're the very definition of vote brigade.

Only the reddit admins get to decide that. Too bad they disagree with you."

First fire: really old and crappy dryer.  Had to be manually turned off or it wouldnt stop.  My mother forgot about it and it ran all day.  You can see where thats going.  
2nd and 3rd: we had lived in a fairly bad neighborhood for awhile, and my parents being the geniuses they were, decided they were not going to let the drug dealers and what not do their business without informing the police or whatever.  We had since moved away from there but still owned the house.  #2 &amp; #3 were acts of arson.  
4th: we had ""heat tape"" wrapped around our water pipes.  Apparently heat tape is a material you wrap around things, plug it in, and then it keeps your pipes from freezing.  A mouse chewed through the cord and started the fire.  
5th: the one that burned the house down. (I think)  
6th: my personal fault but didnt develop into a full blown fire.  Put a pizza in the oven and accidentally hit the clean oven button.  Oven locks and cannot unlock and begins heating up.  Local fire department sorted that out.  
7th: again, not a full blown fire, and not really sure on the minor details.  Younger sister was given box of popcorn packets from 4th grade teacher.  Teacher had tried them herself and didnt like them and said something along the lines of ""these almost burned my house down"".  Again, not sure on the details, but it almost started a fire or something.  I suspect this one was more of the popcorn got burned to hell and was smoking a lot.

No one has to agree with it. 

No one has to understand it.

Two months into it, we're sitting in his car at night. I had never touched his penis before (and he had never had his touched), but I decided to give it a go. It wasn't my first time giving a guy a hand job, but I had never really done it enough to actually make a guy cum (and honestly was kind of grossed out by the whole thing). Well, he seems to be enjoying when he suddenly cries, ""OH *NO*! I DON'T *WANT* TO!"" and holds his crotch and falls/runs out of the car. 

I honestly don't know if he actually did or not because he had disappeared into the woods beside us. But I'm assuming yes. So yes, I have been surprised.

I understand that Sasuke's character has been [all over the place](http://i.imgur.com/sSQfFXM.jpg), but there needed to be some build up for his declaration for hokage. Saying it randomly and leaving it for the fans to figure out was too lazy of Kishimoto. "

1. Synagogues are not churches.

2. Many many churches heavily encourage its members to tithe to them. Tithe, 10% their income, to the church. Go to /r/Christianity and ask them.

&gt;Would a synagogue also not turn me away, even after years of going as you say, if I'm only participating in the congregation's groups?

I would imagine they would not turn a person away no matter what. I went to one synagogue for over a year, they never asked me for money. I did however voluntarily give, and when I was able to afford to do so, pay the small yearly dues. If you cannot afford the full dues that synagogues ask (which happens, we understand), you should give them something, even five dollars, because they do have expenses. "

But I wanted to comment on the smallest guy (not much bigger than the average middle finger).  I am short (5'3"") and he was not much taller than me which was nice to not have to stretch on tippy toes to give my bf a kiss.  After several dates, we started making out and when I went to touch him below the belt, he was almost in tears.  He was small and to be honest I was a bit disappointed but it was mostly due to how upset he was.  After some talking and encourgment from me, we did try to have sex.  I found it felt best for him and me if I was on top.  And except for making sure I did not make to large of movements it worked out ok.  Slow and tender for size as much as for his insecurities.  One odd thing though is that he had a hard time ""popping"" during bjs.  I think it may have mostly been due to nerves, not sure.  He said (and sure sounded like) it felt wonderful.  Kept going once for over 30 mins with no reward :(.  Others guys were mostly 10-15 min range.  Wow sorry so long of a post.

As a 19yo who watches how his younger siblings socialize in high school, I feel that this guide becomes even more true with the current generation of kids. When female teenagers (especially the attractive ones) grow up with needy, beta male teenagers who respond to text messages immediately and constantly validate girls with attention on social media (FB, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.), they begin to agonize over why the dude who just asked them out isn't replying to their pointless calls for attention.

Texts are literally the most shallow, content-less form of communication. You lose all the nonverbals (body language, facial expressions, etc.) that make up at minimum 75% of communication. At least with phone conversations, you have tone and voice. You don't even have that with texts. You're nothing more than a name on a screen.

Now it takes me like 90 min to get ready, so literally twice as long! Especially if I want to do some fancy eye shadow. My makeup routine now is put on primer, then concealer with brush, then foundation with stippling brush, then countouring and blush, then fill in my eyebrows with a brush and actually shape them, put on eye primer, apply eye shadow, then eyeliner (add another 20 min if I wanna attempt wings!), then mascara, then just put on some chapstick cuz I don't want to have to do anything else.

*  Noodlers / Nib (9/10) / Build quality (6/10) / Design (9/10)

*  FPR Dilli / Nib (8/10) / Build quality (9/10) / Design (8/10)

The Dillis are made really well and I doubt one would ever break on you. The nibs are wet and smooth, sometimes they are ""gushers"" However, I've found that Noodlers has better nibs over the long haul that write and flex better. Noodlers has a better design but lesser build quality. 


You can't go wrong with either one. But if I was putting up my money I would go Noodlers all the way. Only because I feel the nibs are better and the FPR Dilli is a very thin pen. It's like holding a small bic and I'm not a fan of thin pens. "

When someone is murdered, and with no afterlife, they not only have to go through the horror and pain of being murdered, their life is cut short and they are robbed of their opportunities to enjoy the only life they'll ever get. *In addition* to that, it causes emotional pain and grief to those who cared about them. 

How could anyone say that murder does not harm the person who is murdered?

The Powerpuff Girls would certainly be able to give Aku a good fight, we've seen various instances of Aku being hit with non magical means, it just doesn't leave any real impact.

The girls are tremendously strong, their best bet would be to try and throw Aku off into space. That tactic would save earth, but Aku would return again some day.

If the girls could get their hands on some magical weapons they could beat Aku 10/10, other than that I don't think they can kill him at all.

GeoffreyArnold,SubredditDrama,1389584073.0,"&gt;But honestly, being part of a minority yourself I hope you'll agree that heightism doesn't compare to racism or sexism or homophobia.

Of course it ""compares"" when you are talking about the mechanics of the prejudice.  Heightism is a systemic prejudice that works in much the same way racism or sexism works, except that heightism is socially encouraged while racism and sexism are stigmatized (though people still practice them).  But, in terms of magnitude, of course heightism isn't as important as racism or sexism.  These other prejudices have a very nasty history in our society and they were even embedded into our legal system.  Heightism is more of a modern prejudice that, I fear, will become worse as time passes and other forms of prejudice become more socially unacceptable.  

But, on an individual level, heightism can be just as bad as racism.  If an employer denies me a job on the basis of my height (where height is not a [BFOQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bona_fide_occupational_qualifications)) , then it has the same result as if I was denied that job on the basis of my race.

*In another dimension stands a very large mansion. Indeed, in size it is more like a palace, but it cannot be denied that it appears to be a mansion, just scaled up in size. It floats in the sky, above a town. The town appears to be a village, the kind of thing one would find in a fantasy book, but instead of blue skies with the sun shining down on flaxen-haired peasantry, an eerie green sky is host to floating green flames that illuminate the world for animated skeletons wearing fine clothing. And then, there is the woman. Six feet tall, but human in appearance. Pale-white skin with an odd shine to it, reptilian eyes, a forked tongue, and fangs. Her attire is like a suit of armor, but instead of steel or iron, it is made out of dragon scales. She carries a halberd, but instead of a metal blade at the end, there is a dragon's fang. As she walks down the streets of the village, heading in the direction of the mansion, the skeleton populace bow their heads to her out of respect. She is, after all, nobility. She is Draculucigas, dragon slayer, the Rebel Queen of the Vampires. And she has business with their master.*  
  
**Draculucigas**  
  
*As she reaches the ground below the mansion, she stops and crosses her arms. She yells to the skyward estate in a thick, Romanian accent.*  
  
""Bonesy! Do not keep me waiting!""  
  
*Green flames surrounding the manor descend upon the warrior queen, stopping before her. They take the shape of marble stairs, and start moving as an escalator does. She takes a step and rides it up, the front doors of the manor opening as she reaches them. Step steps inside the the stairs turn back into a small green flame, which moves, leading the way to her host. As she follows it, the doors close behind her. She walks through the halls, past skeletal serving staff, moving suits of armor that patrol the estate, and paintings that speak to her. ""Hail Lady Draculcigas!"" ""We welcome you, oh Vampire Queen!"" ""It is a pleasure to see you, Dragon Slayer!"" She nods to them, and comes to a door.*  
  
""The library. Of course it is the library. I do not know why I require the flame, he is always in here every time I come.""  
  
*Draculcigas opens the door to the library. Shelves stacked for what must be at least ten stories fill the room, each stuffed with books. In a chair sits her host. One would not imagine this to be a being of great power upon first glance, but one would be wrong. Standing 5'4"", wearing an olive green suit and bowler derby, with brown shoes, a black shirt and a golden tie. He sports a monocle of gold. Were he not a skeleton, one would think he was fat, and yet he inexplicably has a quality of roundness to him. He adjusts his monocle as he reads a blue book, his jaw clacking under his thick, orange mustache, as he laughs with deep, gruff British accent.*  
  
""Hello, Bonesy.""  
  
**Gentleman Bones**  
  
*Gentleman Bones turns his head to the Vampire Queen.*  
  
""Ah, Draculcigas! Lovely of you to come!""  
  
**Draculcigas**  
  
""Why have you called me here? Do you have a new game you would like to play with the world child? Or do you perhaps wish to attempt to recruit the demoness to the cadre again?""  
  
**Gentleman Bones**  
  
""For once, nothing of the sort. Take a look at this!""  
  
*He tosses Draculcigas the blue book he is holding. She opens it. Instead of words on the pages, it is a window, showing things happening in the world. Katrina cries to Souji. Joan jumps off a waterfall. Silver improves weapons for information.*  
  
""An interesting reality, is it not?""  
  
**Draculcigas**  
  
*She tosses the book back to Gentleman Bones.*  
  
""It seems quaint. What is your purpose in showing me this?""  
  
**Gentleman Bones**  
  
""It's the funniest thing. I was watching our favorite star woman in a large hat combat some bizarre tree people, when their leader accidentally fired a beam into space that is supposed to change reality. Curious, I decided to see where it would end up, and it skirted from the end of their universe to the end of this one, hitting nothing, descending upon the island I have shown you in this book. Things changed in a flash. People grew in power, or found themselves richer, or had less power and money. And then, Miss Meteor's little friend managed to accidentally fire the beam again, and again, it left their universe, and entered this one, hitting nothing on its long travels, turning a girl into some bizarre turtle man! An odd coincidence, is it not? For something with such astronomically low odds to happen twice in a row, it must truly be a special reality. And if it is special...""  
   
*Gentleman bones looks Draculcigas in the eyes. She knows that if he had a face, he would be grinning.*  
  
""It is worth playing with. Take a look at this...""  
  
*Draculcigas walks over to Gentleman Bones, reading over his shoulder. He shows her multiple instances of the mind maze.*  
  
""This one cloaked figure takes people into some world of the mind, and tests their character. Then he leaves rewards!""  
  
*Gentleman Bones shows her images of Bowes plotting, then Rickert and Sia plotting, then the person in the Calm Belt, then the tournament.*  
  
""But all of these people are just starting their adventures for the first time, and intrigue is abound. It would be no fun to give them advantages ahead of time, would it? No, I think it best if we see them as they are, before they transform into anything.""  
  
*Bones shoots a spark of magic from his fingertips. When people awaken from Sia's mind maze, they now have boxes instead of items, boxes they cannot open.*  
  
""You will have your prizes soon, my little playthings. But for now... let me see what you do without them."""

redwhiskeredbubul,TheBluePill,1389584522.0,"I've taken the liberty of responding to your objections in one post, since you have responded to me in four separate places on this thread. 

&gt;If so, this knowledge is now severely outdated and has become known as ""Lewontin's Fallacy."" The issue that invalidated his finding is that the racial information is found within the correlation structure of the genome, not simply in a tally of genetic markers. 

I'm not sure what you mean by this statement (again, I am not a student of genetics) but in any case I am not talking about Lewontin. What you call 'Lewontin's Fallacy' appears to refer to a rather controversial article published in 2003 by AWF Edwards which is nicely summarized on the relevant wikipedia page.  I will note in passing that a search on this term seems to bring up a rather large number of crank webpages and blogs, one of the top hits on which leads off by describing Lewontin not as a university professor but as a 'Marxist Jew.' In any case, I was discussing an entirely different conclusion reached by Franz Boas a century ago which stated that socially ascribed racial categories could not be verified as _phenotypes_, in other words, as empirically measurable physical characteristics. Boas's second point, in addition to this one, is relevant to our purposes here, which is that racial categories were not biological but rather socially constructed. This is relevant to the 'severe logical problem' you find, as to how Lewontin estabilshed the racial status of the subjects in question. He did it, if I'm not mistaken, in the same way as 2005 article you cite positively elsewhere (without apparent realization of the contradiction in this case): he asked--he used self-ascribed, socially constructed race as a datum. So I have to emphasize that it is not the case, as you suggest, that race as a category has no meaning: it is simply a _social_ category. This brings us to our next point: 

&gt; A computer program can sort the DNA of people into racial groupings which have almost perfect overlap with the self-identified racial data provided by the study subjects:

&gt;http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-01/sumc-rgm012705.php

&gt;""For each person in the study, the researchers examined 326 DNA regions that tend to vary between people. These regions are not necessarily within genes, but are simply genetic signposts on chromosomes that come in a variety of different forms at the same location.

&gt;Without knowing how the participants had identified themselves, Risch and his team ran the results through a computer program that grouped individuals according to patterns of the 326 signposts. This analysis could have resulted in any number of different clusters, but only four clear groups turned up. And in each case the individuals within those clusters all fell within the same self-identified racial group.
 
This is indeed a rather interesting study that I wasn't aware of. But I think it needs to be taken with a number of caveats in mind. First, nothing in this study supports the conclusions of either the blog I was initially responding to (to the extent that it offers any) or the paper that was linked, nor any of the other extrapolations from racial categories (such as intelligence, thanks to Charles Murray) that are often made. Second, it does not establish much of anything about the importance or usefulness of race as a biological category that has a specific mechanism, such as, say, biological sex, or for that matter any simple Mendelian trait. Third, nothing in this paper establishes the validity of racial categories as a prediction of genotype over any other social heuristic based on descent. For example, if we segregated two white southern towns from each other and required them to exclusively intermarry, they would probably begin to diverge from each other and show genotypic homogeneity. This would not establish that one or either of these two towns would cease to be white and presumably they would both remain so; they would constitute two separate races in a biological but not a social sense. 

What then, does this study establish? That self-reported, socially constructed race is a somewhat reliable predictor of the genetic differences we would expect as a consequence of descent. In short, it supports the usage of racial categories that exists, for example, in clinical medicine: as a rule-of-thumb heuristic for predicting certain dispositions to certain genetic traits for individuals. It does not say anything about the deeper validity of race as a biological construct even compared to the rather controversial differences we attach to biological sex.

It's worth pointing out in this connection that some of the 'racial categories' cited in the study aren't even racial categories in their everyday social sense, such as Asian and Hispanic. For example, ''Hispanic' is a geographical and linguistic category: it indicates that you or your ancestors spoke spanish and hailed from south of the Rio Grande. Thus the category, for example, of 'white hispanic' or 'mestizo.' How, then does this racial category which isn't one predict race? It refers to a social group which tends to intermarry, just like Boston WASPS, Lesbians, or League of Legends enthusiasts.  It is socially constructed. 

In any case, my point is the following. You object to me talking about the scientific validity of race since I don't study genetics. But you beg the question: why is genetics the only field qualified to discuss race? It might be useful, rather, to recognize the other side of the coin, which is quite simply that culture exercises a considerable causal influence on peoples' genotypes.While I appreciate your lifestyle and career advice elsewhere here, which was not at all ill-informed or condescending, I think I will stay in anthropology for now. Whether or not it is a science

&gt;An anthropologist making declarative statements on what constitutes pseudoscience and making appeals to the authority of the American Anthropology Association's statement on race when the AAA has voted to strip references to science from it's own mission statement.

...in the sense that was at issue in the revision of the AAA statement (which was the applicability of hard science as a normative standard with reference to Sociocultural, Linguistic, and Archeological Anthropology, as well as Physical Anthropology (there was a dissenting opinion from the Physical Anthropologists, one of whom I am not)) is not the point. But while I certainly don't claim to represent the last word on evolutionary genetics so that I can recognize that

&gt;Cultural explanations having more legitimacy over physical explanations back in 1900 doesn't imply that the outcome will be the same in 2014.

However, the problem is that  this is only trivially true. The fact that race research _might_ find corroboration against cultural explanation says absolutely nothing about whether or not it in fact _does._ Flat Earth research is also, in principle, subject to verification and the possibility of accuracy over the round earth hypothesis. This does not suffice to make it plausible: plausibility, one might argue, is also socially constructed. However, I would suggest that it is less likely that this research in question will find corroboration if it continues to ignore the entirely mainstream arguments on the social construction of race that have been made in mainstream anthropology for over a century. As it stands, most researchers on race have persisted in arguing their points as if they would constitute refutations of any cultural explanation, which has largely consgined them to marginality such as described below: 
  
&gt;How do you define ""weird?"" 

The institute in question lists no email or contact information on its website,not even a physical address. Its board and staff appears to consist entirely of researchers who have done highly contentious work arguing for the validity of race constructs, including at least one who has been expelled from his academic position in an accredited University in Denmark on this issue. I think this raises questions about the credibility of the research it supports and, for example, its comparability to the Brookings Institute or for that matter mainstream departments of sociocultural anthropology, in one of which I am a PhD student. 

Anyway, thanks for your time.   "

AnimusHerb240,DigitalCartel,1389584750.0,"I have always been interested in ""religious experiences"" because I have always considered myself cut off from them. That is, I would listen to and read about the experiences of others and feel envious. When I was in high school, participating in Christian youth groups, there seemed to be people who outwardly exhibited a genuine connection to the divine, and I was always trying to figure out how to get there myself. I didn't understand why I was left out of the magic. I read the bible. I showed up on Sundays. I sang the songs. My inability to ""get it"" led me to seek out where I might find ""it"" elsewhere, i.e. academic philosophy, comparative religion studies, psychedelic drug use, various art and literature, and the occult. The most solace I found in those days was found in the phrase, ""The Tao that can be spoken is not the true Tao."" I didn't study Taoism at all really beyond knowing that something about that particular phrase was really important and special.

These days my preoccupation with feeling ""cut off"" has subsided a little, and I'm entertaining the idea that maybe I am indeed as connected as everyone else, but in a way that I sort of tend to overlook or take for granted, and therefore am not usually consciously aware. Some of my personal insecurities revolve around not feeling like there is much to my character. But I am reminded by friends occasionally, ""What about this thing? You have this thing."" And I'm like, ""Well, yeah but that's not really a thing about me."" And they're like, ""No, dude. That's totally a thing about you."" And I'm all, ""Shit, I guess you're right...I never really identified with that thing about me but I guess I can't deny that's a part of who I am."" I think there might be something similar going on with my relationship to my own spirituality. Like I don't ""consider myself"" connected, but maybe that is just a quirk of the particular way in which I *am* connected.

I have a friend who is a militant evangelical atheist. He was raised in a very, very Christian community, so it makes sense to me why he'd turn out like that. But what doesn't make sense to me is what someone told me about him: when he was young and still attending a christian school and still ""on fire for jesus"" or whatever, he experienced states of ecstatic union, he really felt connected, like he actually could converse with God. I don't understand how someone evolves from having had such a concrete, maybe even ""paranormal"" experience of God to someone who is outwardly disgusted by believers.

I tend to think of atheists as people who are just angry at God. Not that I believe in God. Not that I don't.

One day when I was tripping in a room of friends (very pleasant, I forget on what, maybe LSD or LSA or shrooms) I felt like I was connected to each of them by a freaking raybeam of love. I couldn't visually ***see*** a ray of light shooting from one person's face to my face or anything like that, but it was like I could just feel it like a fact. That was the first time I ever felt like I was experiencing love like it was this tangible thing, this concrete fact. In that moment, I KNEW we were each nodes in a web of love, in the same way I KNEW my bladder was full. It was just so REAL!

One day when I was tripping in a room by myself (very unpleasant, 2C-B), I had a somewhat traumatic experience of losing my sense of identity, like I had nothing left to hold on to. Every thought that managed to coalesce into language was seen by me as a bizarre alien invader whose origin I was absolutely clueless of.

""I am extremely uncomfortable."" ""This is very unpleasant."" ... *""What the fuck? Who said that?""* ... ***""What the FUCK? Who said THAT???""*** ... ***""AND THAT??!!""*** There was just this barrage of emotions and sensations and thoughts, and they were all too slippery and fleeting to hold onto as any piece of ""my"" identity. I had NOTHING to go on. I tried writing down some of the thoughts, and after staring at the sentences for a while and not feeling like I could ""own"" them myself, I wrote quotation marks around them as if I was quoting somebody else, and that felt more correct. Then that didn't seem right...like I now had the same mental relationship with the quoted thought as I had initially with the unquoted thought. So I wrote another set of quotation marks around it in a different color of pencil. I did this fifteen times until there was just this sentence with fifteen different sets of quotation marks around it, each increasing in size, spiraling outward, and in a different color of colored pencil. I just felt like I was chaos itself, and it was terrifying. I sounded like a nut when I tried to describe it to my wife and metamour later. ""Guys. I **WAS** chaos! I was chaos itself!"" They gave me weird looks even though they were trippers, too!

When I first heard about a relatively recent school shooting in Connecticut, my first thoughts were for the shooter, not the victims, and I felt very alone in this. I was disgusted by the knee-jerk outrage of everyone around me, even though I understood it. ""What a simple, convenient, lazy way to respond to such a tragedy,"" I thought. What kind of mental hell must that person have been in to find themselves staring down the barrel of a gun pointed at children? What could our community have done better to avoid something like this? Seems to me there's a slice of our societal pie that needs a special flavor of nurturing, a flavor that isn't offered or at least isn't very accessible via the institutions that are currently in place...characterize that how you will, I suppose--in whatever arbitrary language suits."

Sorry, I was 1% off.

Other numbers on my search.

&gt;And while the number of U.S. grass-fed beef producers is rising -- from 50 in 2002 to more than 2,000 today -- they face big challenges, including higher operating costs, a shortage of processors, loose standards for the definition of ""grass-fed,"" a lack of consistent quality, and consumer wariness about taste and texture.

&gt; Grazing systems supply approximately 9 percent of the world's production of beef

&gt;So why does the U.S., the world's biggest beef producer, have to go abroad to find enough of the grass-fed variety?

I think the keratin helped, I mean, it worked better than when I put in the expensive John Frieda Frizz ease and Biosilk leave in conditioners into his hair.

Paired with a facial moisturizer and under-eye cream. 

It's difficult to recommend products that will make you ""smell nice"" because it's subjective - I like the salty ocean scents, strawberry essence, apples, and old spice. Some of those aren't necessarily ""manly"" but whatever. 

Nonetheless, I recommend [Pi](http://www.sephora.com/pi-P0956?SKUID=288092&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=288092&amp;om_mmc=ppc-gg-pla) by Givenchy for men.

mkvgtired,news,1389584972.0,"&gt; did their country fall into mayhem and chaos? absolutely not. in fact, Iceland's economy sprang back with much vigor and they are doing quite well today.

Iceland shifted the financial burden to its depositor countries. It changed the law guaranteeing all deposits to cover only Icelandic citizen deposits the day before the the government took over banks, hanging its ""insured"" European customers out to dry. This left European nations on the hook for tens of billions of Euros that were supposedly insured. These European countries now have to wait 50 years to be reimbursed by Iceland. They are the ones who bailed out Iceland's greatly underfunded government insurance program. This was on top of crises they were already managing back home. 

Iceland also [devalued its currency](http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=ISK&amp;to=USD&amp;view=10Y) by roughly 50%. Sixty-one percent of the world's reserve wealth is held in US Dollars, and 24% is held in Euros. If either of those currencies were devalued 50% there would have been chaos, not only in the US and Europe, but globally. 

US Dollars and Euros are not only used in the US and Eurozone, but globally, so devaluation does not just affect Americans or Europeans. This is vastly different than the Icelandic Krona. A devaluation of the USD or EUR would have cut in half the savings of many people in the developing world that prefer to hold USD (and also the countries that use it as an unofficial currency). It would have decimated the purchasing power of not only American and European social services funds, but would have wiped out half of 85% of the worlds' sovereign holdings. Nations prefer US Treasuries, German Bunds, or British debt because they're safe, not because they lose 50% of their value in a couple months. Wars have been started over far less. 

These are just some of the reasons comparing Iceland to the US or Europe is like comparing apples and oranges. There are countless more, but my comment is already getting long. Long story short, the US, Eurozone, or UK didn't have another jurisdiction they could dump their burden on all while inflating away much of the problem, Iceland did.

**TL;DR: I definitely dont think all the decisions American or European regulators made were the right ones, but acting as if they had the same options as an economy 1/4th the size of Birmingham, Alabama's that controls its own currency is beyond shortsighted.**"

They may not be the type of person you want to have a relationship with, but that doesn't mean they are less ""real"" or less bi. The reason you're getting hostility here is because you aren't just asking how to find people that fit your needs or preferences - you're outright implying that those who don't fit your personal needs or preferences don't belong in this community. Seeing as the bi community is, by definition, one of the broader and more open-minded ones, that doesn't usually come across well. Please feel free to restate your question in a more value-neutral manner, but this really isn't the place to pass a judgement on people because they don't fit your preferences. "

These situations are always difficult to get through for a whole host of reasons.  It doesn't seem fair,  the other person is out living normally where you are a complete wreck. The best advice I've heard and used was to go and live your life the best you can right now.  If you can't feel amazing on the inside,  go out and treat yourself to something superficial.  I've sat many times at the salon with tears in my eyes and my heart broken getting a nice hair cut.  I looked myself in the mirror and saw nice hair after and it brightened my day, even for a little bit.

I've thought about this same thing myself, and for me, it comes down to what you said---the realization that no one can choose how they look (at least to an extent). I'm not physically perfect, but I think I'm a good person and have things to offer. It feels very arrogant of me to look at someone and think, ""His appearance doesn't make me drool, therefore, he's automatically a no."" Sometimes that gets twisted in my head as, ""I'll settle for anything."", when it's really just a manifestation of how precious and special I think a deep interpersonal connection is. The ""okay"" people you mentioned are blank slates to me. They have the potential to be the hottest person in the world, depending on their personality.

A) You need to tell your friend. His wife went outside of their marriage. I would give the same advice if the genders were reversed.

B) Your friend needs to consult a divorce lawyer ASAP. This isn't about revenge, getting even, etc...it's about protecting himself.

C) I don't care if you have to cut off his hands, DO NOT LET HIM SIGN THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE!

D) Your ""friend"" is not a friend. She has proven that she can't keep the most ""sacred"" of vows. She betrayed her husband's trust and she betrayed *your* trust, because, from the sounds of it, wouldn't associate with this kind of person.

Fact is, OP, this woman cannot be trusted. She's wanting to trick her husband in to raising another man's child. I would tell him to his face, and in front if her. She doesn't deserve your friendship, or his partnership."

I have a high-paying job and no debts. Sure, I work hard, but I also had parents who could pay for my college, leaving me with no student loans. Friends of mine who worked just as hard are struggling with a ton of debt through no stupid decisions of their own. If we both lose our jobs for three months, I'll be fine because I have savings, and they'll be screwed because much of the money I put into savings, they're required to put into loan payments - and they'll still have to make payments when they're unemployed. 

That's why unemployement insurance exists. It's not to help out lazy entitled screwups who get fired from their job and then sit around all day. I'm sure people like that exist, but that's not most people who use it. It's to help hardworking people who didn't start out with all of life's advantages and hit some bad luck. Other welfare programs are similar - they're to help good people get back up on their feet.

So while you can debate on whether or not it's okay to not care about good, hardworking people who are unlucky, you're starting from a false premise if you assume that most poor people are not like that."

_TIXCY_,AskReddit,1389585315.0,"I sold my phone to a guy on CL once, met him at his job (used car dealership), and he was really nice. 

About a week later, I found a box of cases and accessories for the phone, it was an LG Voyager, so I called him and asked if he wanted them. The were mostly all pink or polka-dotted and feminine but he took them anyway. For some reason, this made him think we were best friends and for the next few weeks, he texted me asking what he should get his wife for her birthday, and would send me random pictures of jewelry asking if I thought his wife would like it. I would just say sure, or whatever.

I guessed her birthday passed cause he quit texting me, but a few months later I went with my friend to where he worked because he was looking at a car. I start talking to the manager about this guy, guy kind of freaks out, and then tells me the guy hasn't worked there in over a year, isn't married unless it happened right after he was fired, and that I should probably change my number.

I also had a bill on school choice, giving parents credits to go to the school of their choosing. It’s difficult to pass even good common sense legislation.""

[He wasn't for giving parents choice over their kid's schools, he was in favor of giving public school funding to private schools in the forms of vouchers.](http://www.texasobserver.org/house-goes-big-against-school-vouchers/) I was at the Senate committee hearing that over saw some of these bills and parents and educators lined up to speak against them. 

One bill would have given parents with special needs kids vouchers to go to private schools. Sound like a good idea? Yeah I thought it might be ok until a certified special ed teacher testified that private schools aren't held to any state standard when it comes to special ed and that the education those kids would get would have no over sight. 

These guys just spurt out shit like ""It is common sense legislation"" and hope that no one actually knows the subject matter. 

These bills were designed to defund public education and funnel the money into private schools. There were about half a dozen bills introduced in the regular session that would have done this. This guy is just more of the same. In fact, he is a weaker version of Dan Patrick. 

And this:

""With faith in the public square being demonized in the media, how do you handle that?"" Uh, you handle it by not blowing smoke about it being demonized. Shall I link the Senate floor testimony during the battle about abortion last summer? Every single Republican Senator and one Democrat Senator gave Christian and Catholic sermons on the floor.

jemzinthekop,LiverpoolFC,1389585460.0,"I do not have enough superlatives in my vocabulary to appropriately discuss this match.  The obvious are “passion” and “intensity” along of course with “sloppy” (in every sense of the word).  But there were so many sub-stories among the big stories and these stories are what made this game incredible.


**The Obvious**

*	We lost a 2-0 lead and it was to two former Reds who were the culprits.  To make matters worse, we then gave up a goal to a Blue Scouser to bring the game within 1 goal further down the line.  I am proud to say though that for the sake of the drama alone, this is simply poetic.


*	The penalty on Sterling is a major source of debate and I am one who would say it was probably a bit harsh against Stoke on this one, however I feel it is only harsh because I have grown accustomed to not having the debatable calls in our favour in recent years (See Goodison Park 2012).  But Sterling was brought down by a leg that was in his way and simply put, that is a foul and as such it should have been given.


*	Our defense looked suspect once again, but to be fair the place looked a mess to play in.  That is all I can say, Stoke got very fortunate to have 2 goals scored through defender legs and our boys threw themselves in front of everything they could.


*	Our supporters once again were fantastic.  As someone sitting at home yelling at the set, there was no doubt our fans were there in full voice.  


**The Less Obvious**

*	Our goal keeper kept us in the match once again with some fantastic (and very timely) stops on top of the few difficulties.   Mignolet showed once again that as his experience grows, he will be capable of single-handedly stealing matches for the club notwithstanding the odd moment of difficulty. 


*	That sublime goal from Suarez which was a result of a masterful pass by Sturridge was made possible by a Martin Skrtel tackle at the other end of the pitch.  It was not all gloom for our defense and this play was instrumental in securing the 3 points.


*	Luis Suarez is showing himself to not only be one of the finest talents on the planet but he is showing himself to be more and more a leader on this squad.  For no better example watch the goal celebration from the boys after the Sturridge goal and look for Suarez to beckon Raheem Sterling to get in the celebration.  The lads were 100% unified at that moment.  This is a great example of the quality of Luis’ football character and we should all hope to see this for the rest of the season and beyond.


*	The boss wants to win.  That is a great thing.


This is exactly the character game our lads needed for the next run of matches.  There are so many positives to take from this game but none more than the resolve of this club today.  I cannot imagine any team in this league would want to face our squad right now after playing a poor technical match in horrible conditions at a stadium that is as tough as anywhere to play, yet leaving with 5 goals in tow.  Initially, my only disappointment in this match was that didn’t happen prior to the Chelsea and City matches, but as I remembered that the goal of making the Champions League this year is the first point of order, it may be more telling of the quality of this squad that it happened *after* those two difficult losses.  Our lads are hungry and it shows and if we do end up cracking the top 4 this year I feel this game will go down of one of the defining matches of the year.

Necron_Overlord,OneY,1389585583.0,"&gt; Many young men growing up in recent decades have been taught to suppress pro-social inclinations and behave anti-socially in the name of masculinity. Many young women have been taught that technical pursuits are un-feminine.

On the flip side of this, many women believe they have far more social intelligence and intuition than they do, while far more men believe they are rational and logical than they actually are.

&gt;The article writer believes that people are blaming feminists for the travails of men.

She's correct to some extent -- feminists do get the blame for a lot of men's problems that they really have nothing to do with, and even more problems that have more to do with the sexual revolution than feminism.  But one thing that feminists actually are too blame for is the crises in masculinity, and that's the one thing she tries to absolve them of.  It's kinda hilarious.

The crises in masculinity has been brought about by the collapse of traditional gender roles in the wake of women gaining political and economic equality (which feminist generally take *credit* for), and their subsequent failure of society to reinvent gender roles in a way that allows for that equality.  

There's only one group of people in the West actively fighting to dismantle gender constructs and not allow them to be replaced.  That's feminists!  Nobody else is waging war on the very *concept* of gender.  We would not even be *having* this conversation about masculinity in this forum right now if not for the impact of feminism on our culture.

The author of this piece misses the point entirely when she talks about men needing to become more like women to fulfill the masculine provider role -- the masculine provider role doesn't work with equality!  Men need a new role, a role that *isn't* the provider role. "

She is a non violent offender, and I don't believe she had any prior arrests or record of any kind. That is a large reason why she is able to be on probation. I'm sure being a white woman and a mom of young children helped keep her out of jail as well. 

Personally, I'm ok with no jail time. I don't think she will reoffend, she will have to pay back the money she stole (there are pretty strict guidelines involved), and $2,000 a month will affect her life immensely. This way she will have a reminder of what she did every month for the rest of her life. I'd much prefer more sentences like these than jail time."

TryUsingScience,changemyview,1389585844.0,"One problem with the poster you link is that most of the advice is not useful. Most rape victims weren't roofied or dragged into dark alleyways. 

If it were to give advice to truly decrease a person's risk of being raped it would say, ""Don't go on dates. Don't get into a relationship with someone. Never be alone with another person in any situation."" But those aren't things you can reasonably avoid and be a functional human.

It would be as if the second sign said ""Never go near the gap."" Which is impossible to follow and still be able to get on the train. If you want to have a sexual relationship with another human you have to put yourself in circumstances where they may rape you if they turn out to be a scumbag. Likewise, if you want to get on a train you have to put yourself in a circumstance where it's possible (though unlikely) for you to fall under the train.

If thousands of people got on a train every day, and as soon as someone fell under one everyone called them an idiot for going near the gap, it would be absurd. They had to go near the gap to get on the train! Plenty of people go near the gap and it's fine! Yet if a woman goes home with a guy she barely knows and gets raped, it's her fault, even though plenty of women go home with guys they barely know and end up married to them later. 

The sign is a list of mostly useless tips. A sign with a list of useful tips would be absurd. That's why the sign is stupid."

Look at the declarative form of the statement:

Since the contraction has to move with the verb, you must say, ""Isn't it a beautiful day?""

I'm sure the VR clipon will have its uses, but it will be a disgusting poor option for gaming and a terrible competitor to a dedicated VR option. 

Just to be clear, I am talking about gaming and gaming only. We are in gaming subreddit after all. I'm sure an architect will love the CastAR and VR clipon.

That book alone led me to consider how these things can be manipulated and used maliciously against the general public, and since I read it, I haven't been able to shrug off any manner of moral responsibility in my writing. 

It's not like I'd change my entire plot or my protagonist to fit a nebulous, pseudo-universal ""moral code,"" but the raw ideas I come up with nowadays seem to naturally fall in an ethical line, long before I put them on paper.

dakru,AskMen,1389586163.0,"I'd give him this paragraph, which explains one of the most important lesson anyone can learn about attraction:

&gt; Women who try to attract men by being successful are like men who try to attract women by being sweet or gentle. While being sweet won't necessarily ruin a man's chances with women (in some cases it will), neither will it draw her in. Likewise, although a woman's business or academic success won't usually turn a man off (in some cases it will), neither will it attract him. Both of these misconceptions are examples of the sexes projecting their own desires onto the other. It is women, not men, who find career success attractive, because it demonstrates drive, focus, strength, initiative - masculine qualities. Likewise it is men, not women, who find gentleness attractive, because it is a symptom of openness, receptiveness, nuturing ability - feminine qualities. I got bored when the girl I was dating talked about work in the same way that women get turned off when a man starts smothering them with flowers and gifts, or constantly apologizes unnesessarily. [http://www.therulesrevisited.com/2012/05/men-dont-care-about-your.html]

The lesson is that men and women don't necessarily find the same things attractive. A guy trying to attract women by doing what would make him attracted to a woman (or a woman trying to attract men by doing what would make her attracted to a man) is unlikely to end well. If you want to do better with the opposite sex, you should be able to look at the traits of the people they tend to go for and work on taking on these traits yourself.

Travellerknight,changemyview,1389586229.0,"Many good points, but allow me to countermand a couple:

I agree that at the moment the Euro has some issues in regards to its younger members, but isn't that more an issue of the EU allowing countries within it too quickly, whom are not ready for the change to the Euro? I would envision that the government of the EU be a lot more picky and patient before allowing others to join the integrated union

In regards to International relations, if the EU itself became a single union, what would be the issues of something like gibralter, whether administered by the UK state or Spanish state, it would still be within the EU superstate

In regards to the Libyan example, yes the UK and France wanted in, but the others were hesitant, within a unified EU state, wouldn't that be determined by a vote? Therefore allowing those dissenting putting their voice to the floor to disagree, and the vote allowing a chance towards say no, but if a majority wanting to go in, it would and vice versa?

I agree that large scale projects don't require a political union, my argument is that with a political union these projects are far more likely to be developed and would have a lot less red tape as you will, as well as a greater source of funding, ie Germany agreed to help in the construction of a Dam in the Mediterranean, in exchange for help developing a interstate railway for example)

Monster Hunter is a game that doesn't give you much slack - if any. It provides a fair, distinct set of basic rules and elements of gameplay that never change, only intensify, and forces the player to adapt to those.

You have fifty minutes to kill this. You can kill this in significantly less than that. If you get yourself into a, b, c bad situations, you'll be killed. You can play to avoid those situations. Et cetera, et cetera. You adapt - I still think fondly of the claw.

The game challenges you and punishes you harshly, because you absolutely, without a doubt can overcome the challenges it presents - you just have to earn your victories, even if it means triple carting a few times. I don't like failing a quest either, but that's where it falls to taste: struggle makes the victory sweeter.

It didn't help that many of my classmates saw IT as a ""soft subject"" and few of them had any reason to be there. 

As for the industry, the biggest problem is its comparative age. IT as an industry is still maturing, and I've been through workplaces that don't understand important concepts like IT security, due process and accountability. All they want is for the end user to be happy and productive, while the bean counters slice the IT budget to the bone.

Having said this, don't be too discouraged, I'm a cynical old bastard who is worn out trying to effect positive change, you may well find a good employer who values their IT staff, so if anything, take my opinion as nothing more than a cautionary tale, and as always, find at least two other sources to cite! =)"

When they were in the forest of death, it was Naruto's bravery that jump-started Sasuke's bravery.  At the battle at Vally of the End, Sasuke said to Naruto ""You have become my closest friend"".  

Later he faces Naruto when Sai came to ask Sasuke about bonds (pissing him off that he was woken up for that) and he actually hesitates to kill Naruto.  (But Orochimaru finished the job of saving Team 7).  Later on, he begins to hate what Naruto stands for (at this point, do you blame him?).

RJ815,gamedev,1389586664.0,"&gt; How many people are going to be interested in it

Well, depends on what project it is. Underwater basket weaving simulator 2014 might not be audience-grabbing, but something else might and you won't know until you start pitching the idea to friends and internet strangers and whatnot. Be warned that you shouldn't have your project be too cliche though. If it looks like Minecraft or Terraria for example, many will probably pass it up even if it's a really good game simply because it's a look that's getting stale like modern military shooters in AAA. On a similar note, ""retro"" pixel art style games are ignored by many due to it being perhaps the least difficult art style to accomplish, meaning it features prominently in many crappy games and turns some people off (though some like good pixel art whenever they see it).

&gt; would it be worth it in the long run

Depends on what your goals are. If you aim to create things with greater creative control and any profit just being a bonus, then you'll probably be fine. If you try to aim for getting rich through indie, you might be setting your expectations too high, at least right now, though there are some superstars out there. If you aim to think the process will be easy, you might lose willpower partway through the project. Cool ideas are fun to think about and implement, but often more nitty gritty details will bog you down and be the ""work"" part of your work. Building a game takes a lot of work, and it can be overwhelming for just a single person. I'd say building a team of at least one programmer, one visual artist, and one musician / sound designer is damn near necessary for delegation of work. Doing everything yourself is possible, as people like Cave Story's Pixel show us, but it's way harder than just trying to specialize in one aspect and having a reliable team for other aspects."

I'm not talkative around people I don't know, but I'll tell you what I think if asked, and like most people am talkative one on one or when I know most of the group.  I'm very blunt and say things the way I see them - sometimes leading to conflicts with people who disagree with my point of view and are also outspoken.  I talk in a serious manner and tone most of the time, so to folks who don't know me I seem serious all the time, when usually I'm not and often I'm being sarcastic - which in groups is fun as people who don't know me think I'm serious and those who do know I'm not.  It adds an extra element of humor.  I'm a good listener, and give solid advice if I think it's pertinent and logical.  I find a lot of people are comfortable venting or telling me about their problems.  Not sure what quality that reflects, but you can't say that of everyone.  I don't have the drive to do things by myself most of the time - I'm not going to go out hiking on the weekend by myself, though I'll do all kinds of stuff, including new things if someone else plans it.  That doesn't seem like a positive thing, or at least not one I can think of a good way of wording.

reginaidiotarum,TumblrInAction,1389586848.0,"SJW is very religious, that is one of the problems. Again, different terms for the same thing. SJW mentality, however, seems to be going about the steps in the opposite directions. For instance, most religions agree that humans have a spiritual flaw, and by following the steps of the religion, you will be freed from that flaw. In Christianity, the flaw is called ""Sin."" In SJW, the flaw is called Privilege.

Most religions, especially in the west, believe that you can feed into the spirit of a divine force to overcome your flaws. In Christianity this would be called, ""God."" We do the opposite within SJW, the divine force is not benevolent, but malevolent. We feed into the spirit with our ignorance of other people's suffering. The spirit in SJW is called, ""Patriarchy.""

The path to spiritual redemption is a complicated one. Sometimes it involves 40 days in a desert, or under a fig tree. In SJW the path to spiritual enlightenment comes with ""checking your privilege."" The SJW believes that close observance of your personal privilege will prevent you from feeding the evil spirits, and if you check them hard enough, you may find that you weren't as privileged as you originally thought. Maybe you're a transgender male pronoun using male identified male. If you were female, you'd be a male in a female body.

In most religions, the path to salvation in a personal one. If you are a good Christian, you go to heaven, and if you are bad, you go to Hell. In SJW salvation is a universal goal. Since the spirit of Patriarchy is feed by those ignorant of their privilege, any person that does not accept this doctrine feeds into that evil spirit. You would think that this would make a very coordinated radical movement, but since it's a religion that teaches you to find flaws in everyone around you, it's very rare for individuals of this religion to form up for very long, usually just long enough to tear down a third party."

Is it the homeowners who took out a third mortgage for an addition to their house?  Is it the ones who didn't realize what a variable interest rate does to payments?  The ones who lost their job out of the blue and couldn't keep up?

Is ""they"" the regional bank that bought the loan?  Is it the overstressed 20-something analyst at Bank of America who told his boss that he checked out this security?

Is it the CEOs that couldn't keep track of every part of their company?  If banks are too big to manage, what should the limit be?  If banks are too big to manage, how the hell does the President run the US government then?

Or maybe it is the government regulators, who couldn't keep up with the pace of change in the finance industry.  Why couldn't they?  Not enough of them, underfunded?  Well I guess ""they"" is Congress now.  Or is it the glacial pace of the judicial branch?

majekmistake,kpop,1389586892.0,"I've missed B1A4! I have some pretty high hopes going into this, their last mini was one of my favorites of 2013. Here we go!

**1. Intro - Prologue** - This is a pretty instrumental. Anyone ever watch The Fox and the Hound? That harmonica that comes in around the 30 second mark instantly took me back to watching the blossoming friendship between Copper and Tod. **4/5**

**2. Lonely** - In the past B1A4's title songs have been hit or miss for me, I'm either instantly head over heels in love them or I instantly dislike them. This is the first time I'm initially feeling lukewarm toward one and it's getting better as I listen to it. I'm living for those falsettos and la la la's. I could listen to a whole track of lazy la la la's by B1A4. **3.5/5**

**3. Baby** - Eh, this one's a little flat in my opinion. I got halfway through it and felt like I'd heard enough. **2/5**

**4. Amazing** - This song is nice. I feel like it'd be a good cruising song in the summer. **4/5**

**5. 사랑 그땐** - This song is okay, nothing super special in my opinion. **3/5**

**6. Seoul** - Another 'meh' for me. I like the feeling they're putting into all of the r&amp;b-ish vocals on this album but the pace of the song itself seems really flat to me. **2/5**

**7. Road** - There we go, this is what I expect from B1A4. It's pretty and well sung and also interesting. One of my favorites on the album **4.5/5**

**8. Drunk With Music** - The instrumental is more interesting than the vocals but they're not bad. **3.5/5**

**9. Who Am I** - I love this one. It's so effortlessly fun and pretty. I want a concert/behind the scenes montage video set to this song by the end of this promotion. **5/5**

**10. Too Much** - Dear Sandeul, I talk about my love for Jinyoung all the time these days but we both know my heart has been yours since [Crush](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwVG3-DIBN4). Keep putting out songs like this and you'll have it forever. Beautiful job by Gongchan too.**5/5**

**11. Pretty** - This song makes me want to snap my fingers and sway like a backup singer in a doo wop band. Love it. **5/5**

**12. Oh My God** - I think it'd be better if we all just forget that intro ever happened. Otherwise this song is okay. **3.5/5**

**Total: 3.75/5** - Not as strong as their last mini im my opinion. There are some real stars on the album but a couple of the tracks kinda sound the same and blend together to me."

little_shirley_beans,AskReddit,1389586938.0,"Hey, op! If you are nervous to fly I'd recommend going to your doctor. Mine prescribed a few pills of lorazepam that i can take when i fly. It seriously helps so much-it just takes the edge off everything! I'd really recommend it.

As for my worst trip story:

I haven't flown since i was 6 (about 20 years ago) and I'm a huge worrier so i was super nervous. And i was flying alone, which only exasperated things, I'm sure. I had taken a trial run of my happy pill at home one day so I'd know what to expect, but since u was just sitting calmly at home eating pizza, i had no idea how long it took to kick in. The day of my flight i took my pill along with my lunch, but, apparently, it should have been earlier.

Since i hadn't flown for 20 years, all of my knowledge of planes comes from TV and movies where planes are big and spacious. I stepped on my plane and it was small, and cramped, and super rickety-looking, and i swear, was straight out of the 1970's. It was just destined to fall apart in the sky. 

Then i get to my seat, which is directly over the engine. So i can see the second the engine explodes everywhere and we start to crash. Also, because the engine was so close, it was really loud. I couldn't hear any of the safety demonstration, and the weird booklet, with its wordless examples of what to do, wasn't helping. 

I was trying to tune this all out, but by time we were on the runway I had tears just streaming down my face. Both the flight attendant next to us and the mom of two small children next to me were very concerned about me. It was awful. 

Luckily, by the time we were descending, my pill kicked in. For awhile, it looked like (totally wasn't actually a threat, just looked like it) our plane was going to land right on the river. By that time it was like, ""oh, we're going to land in the river and die. Ok.""

I hope your flight goes well, OP! And if you do get the happy pills, take them early! They really chill you the hell out! "

Slyfox00,armoredwomen,1389586943.0,"Good choices. Based on what you've just said and things learned prior I recommend these three anime:

All three have female protagonists. All three feature action/adventure that includes violence. All three queer themes., and of course they are all really good must see stories. Mnemosyne is the most mature of the three and is a personal favorite. Have fun!

TIGit,personalfinance,1389586962.0,"- Some people like home repair. It's a hobby of both my father's and myself. So ""fixing garbage disposals on the weekends"" actually sounds pretty cool. And that's all tax write off as repair cost.

- Evicting tenants sucks though. That's true. Save the plumbing make sure they don't flush a ton of diapers or cement down the main!

- You sort of expect renters to trash a house tbh. Itr'a not theirs, they're not vested in it's maintenance and such so the property will always come back to you worse. You just plan accordingly and pad the insurance/rent/prep accordingly (like limited carpet because linoleum is harder to ruin and cheaper to replace, etc).

- Repair costs are tax deductible. Fix half the ROF and it's wholly a write off, fix the other half next year and it's also repair not maintenance. Fix the whole thing and you have to call it maintenance and property value increase and put it on a 30 year depreciate.

- Location, location, location. There's always risk, like a local employer shutting down, but a good location is always awash in tenants. Paying that mortgage without a renter is also something you plan for in your expenses. About 1/10 of each rent I set aside for the inevitable empties.

It is real work, it can have mixed results in return too. People don't seem to see that much like stocks you make your money when you buy something good at a dirt cheap price and watch it rise in value. A lot of people seem to buy their properties at retail prices rather than track down yellow lists and wholesalers if they don't want to do the digging for cheap properties with higher return."

I cleaned out the throttle body but I should probably try to get at the MAF and check the 02 sensors, too. That's crazy you got 45 MPG!

The low usage can certainly be an issue. With 2 of the three older cars I bought, for a few years before I bought them the children and grandchildren had driven them occasionally so they got some use.

The Escort had not been used as much. It lived its entire life in a garage in Southern California, so most of the metal parts are in great shape. However, some of the rubber parts needed changing. I changed all the heater/radiator hoses as they were in bad shape, and I also changed the tires. All the CV boots are torn so I bought some new CV axles and will install them when I work up the courage (only $100 total for both!). The coolant was rusty brown...gave it a serious flush.

i read that the game got delayed so long partly because they would constantly scrap portions of code and restart from scratch. the problem was that all the initial tinkering took so long, they ended up missing deadlines a year or two.  


after that, they realized that the next generation of consoles were already announced and will soon be in production. so the nukem designers went back to see what they can do to make the game next-gen ready.  i imagine a lot of code would need to be rewritten from scratch to accommodate the next gen console."

Wyboth,AskReddit,1389587277.0,"&gt;That's not my problem. If you don't like what someone says. Don't listen to them. If you're so fragile mere words make you cry, you deserve it.

That's like throwing a rock at someone's head and saying it's their fault for getting hurt. ""Oh, but it's just a bunch of atoms! How could atoms possibly hurt you?"" Whether you like it or not, people are going to be hurt by jokes about rape or domestic violence. So, just be a nice person and don't say them. Find some other joke that's funny and say it instead.

&gt;That could happen about literally everything.

[Here](http://www.medicinenet.com/posttraumatic_stress_disorder/page3.htm) are the things that can cause PTSD. I'll quote it for you, since you are apparently incapable of clicking links.

&gt;Virtually any trauma, defined as an event that is life-threatening or that severely compromises the physical or emotional well-being of an individual or causes intense fear, may cause PTSD. Such events often include either experiencing or witnessing a severe accident or physical injury, receiving a life-threatening medical diagnosis, being the victim of kidnapping or torture, exposure to war combat or to a natural disaster, exposure to other disaster (for example, plane crash) or terrorist attack, being the victim of rape, mugging, robbery, or assault, enduring physical, sexual, emotional, or other forms of abuse, as well as involvement in civil conflict. Although the diagnosis of PTSD currently requires that the sufferer has a history of experiencing a traumatic event as defined here, people may develop PTSD in reaction to events that may not qualify as traumatic but can be devastating life events like divorce or unemployment.

There you have it. Don't make jokes about those things outside of your close circle of friends, because you don't know if someone who underwent those kinds of trauma will read your joke and be triggered.

&gt;If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.

Easy for you to say. For these people, especially rape survivors, there is no way to ""get out of the kitchen,"" because everywhere they go, they hear rape jokes. Also, that's a terrible sexist slur, and you should feel bad for making it.

&gt;Respect is earned, not granted. 

If everyone felt that way, people would be waiting to receive respect for a really long time. No, you need to have a base level of respect which you give to everyone. I'm sure you already do have one, but you don't notice it. For example, when someone insults you in person, do you kill them? Of course not! You respect them enough not to do that. Although that's a very basic level of respect, it is indeed respect. If nobody respected anyone else, we'd still be in the dark ages. Cooperation is essential to the advancement of our species, and your attitude isn't going to get us there.

&gt;You don't get it. I could say ""there is no such thing as god"" and that statement could offend someone. Indeed there are people on this planet that would literally cry just hearing someone say that.

That's not what we're talking about, though. Rape and domestic violence survivors are very numerous, as opposed to the people who might be offended by atheism. You can't blow them off as being a crazy, small group of people.

&gt;I'm under no obligation to give a shit about your feels. If you don't like what I have to say, you're free to leave at any time.

Of course you don't *have* to care. That's not what I'm arguing. I'm arguing that you should care, becasue it will improve your relationships with other people. How do you ever expect to get a girlfriend if you don't care about her feelings? I've already addressed the bit about ""leaving.""

&gt;I'm the type of person that doesn't give a flying fuck about your feels. Grow up, and quit being a professional victim.

You are very selfish, and you lack human empathy. Those are your two problems. You are selfish because you are not willing to give up something as simple as a joke for the sake of other people's well being, and you lack human empathy because you cannot understand how bad it actually feels to have something joked about that has made your life miserable.

I don't even think it's completely true that women are attracted to ""status"" characteristics in men. It's a bit more complicated than that. If it were true though, I wouldn't even mind, as it would simplify a lot of things.

As for capital a good compromise would be to build a dedicated capital centre, similar to ACT in Australia when I couldn't be decided between Sydney/Melbourne.
I would a require a change of thinking of my country, to my state within the country and given enough time and belief I believe it could be done, with people loyal to their state and Union.
In regards to disagreements, surely those could be discussed and argued in government at parliament?

I agree that the USA has a different birth, so to speak, compared to this theoretical union but surely a constitution of United European states wouldn't be impossible, difficult due to conflicts of interest, but not impossible.

Ultimately its what people feel more important, their history of being indepentant, and in many case being at each others throats throughout history, or the potential to provide more for more people in a united union. It would be difficult, almost impossible on language decision alone but not impossible.
And yes, while the landscape of Europe has been unstable, so it would be difficult, but there are parables in the world right now, with several countries in Africa, discussing the idea to united into a larger federation: [Example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_Federation)

Holland America is a great cruise line for sure. But they have small ships. I'm truly curious what ships you have sailed on. They do all offer different experiences. If you're on Majesty which has a guest capacity of around 1600, it's going to be different than Allure which holds around 5600.

With regards to suicide and euthenasia, I am in favor of a person being allowed to end their own life if they wish. That becomes complicated if they have dependents such as minor children and I certainly think it would be best if people with suicidal thoughts would seek counseling before going through with it but it is their life to do with as they please. 

Euthenasia of, say, a comatose or vegetative patient is a bit tougher since they can't consent to it and the decision must be made by someone else. But if there is virtually no hope of recovery, it really doesn't make much sense to use technology to keep them alive.

Riali,ABraThatFits,1389587711.0,"Ok, short and wide roots, and it sounds like the bras that are giving you trouble are both too tall in the cup and narrow in the wire.  If you're not quadboobing everywhere in a 38D (I'm assuming you're scooping and swooping) then probably the alternative method of figuring, for 36+ band sizes applies to you.  That gives you a 38DD/E, which is pretty close to where you are, woot woot!  Ok, so three questions- 

* 1. What brand and model are the bras you have now?
* 2. Have you tried the leaning test for fullness?  If you lean over barebreasted, so your back is parallel to the floor, is more of your breast tissue closer to your head, and your nipple pointing more towards your legs, or is your nipple pointing more toward your head, and more tissue is nearer your legs?  If the former, you're fuller on top, and the latter, fuller on bottom.  If it's even, you're even.  I'm guessing with short roots and breastfeeding, its fuller on bottom, but anything is possible.  
* 3. Where is the wire sitting on the sides and bottom, relative to your breast tissue?  Right next to it, on it, or drifting away from it?"

I think people  feel like they're being censored by being asked to be sensitive, but I feel like there's more to it than that.

If you have a close relative that dies, you clean up and decorate the grave, and you have a religious ceremony to celebrate their life, and the sugar skulls and special food and clothes are all part of that, and it's a very emotional experience because it's helping you deal with the loss of someone you love.

My grandpa is very devoutly Catholic.  Catholic mass is a very moving, spiritual experience for him, and if non-christians put on a fake mass with a fake communion just because they thought it looked cool, then that would probably hurt his feelings because he feels like something he takes very seriously and is very emotionally connected to was done for the wrong reasons and missing the most important parts.  


Same way veterans would probably feel about someone doing a fake flag ceremony and messing up parts of it.  
 
I'm not saying you should never hurt anyone's feelings or offend anyone for the sake of art, but I feel like it's just bad manners to take something that some people feel is very important and that helps them mourn their dead friends and siblings or whoever and say that they shouldn't be so *sensitive* about it."

teenit88,AskReddit,1389587847.0,"My sister was getting bullied in high school during one of her classes, and the school/teacher wasn't doing anything to stop it.  So, after several months of this, and one week before I graduated, I went into the class and told the kids to knock it off or else I would call the cops because it was a hate crime (my sister uses a wheelchair).  

The teacher got super pissed, told me I was making it worse and embarrassed my sister, I got fed up and told her that if she had been doing her job, no one would be getting bullied in the 8-student-class in the first place.  I got called down to the vice principal's office, but no one was there and so I called my mom.  She laughed and told me to come home, so I did.  Nothing was ever said to me after my mom emailed the teacher and told her that she deserved it."

When I was younger I had conflicting emotions on who I was. I knew I was gay, but even in the mid 2000's I'd see shit on the TV about how gay men were perverts, the bane of the Earth, and it was obvious I had glitter in my shoes and that was what sent me home with black eyes and split lips. 

MY world was awash with denial and trying to be someone I wasn't. 

However, when I discovered internet pornography it helped me become more secure in who I was, and honestly helped me with my little identity crisis. 

It was a little portal to a place where I knew I was safe in affirming my homosexuality. Porn actually helped me out a lot. "

My recommendation is to just jump in with all of it. My reasoning is that ""easing myself in"" is just another way of allowing myself to cheat. And if I let myself cheat, then I will keep letting myself cheat, and I will never see any results.

* [Pierogi recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/pierogi-polish-dumplings/).  Not sure how it got so highly rated, as there's a number of obvious mistakes in it (in retrospect).  Dough needs considerably more flour (at least another cup), and I ended up tossing the first attempt.  Only other significant change was frying in butter after broiling.
* Second attempt at dough, I used [this recipe](http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/pierogidoughs/r/SourCreamDough.htm).  Still needed more flour than called for.  Might go as much as a half of a cup if I tried again.
* [Mashed potatoes](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/basic-mashed-potatoes/), half the potatoes+milk, but the same amount of butter.
* Kielbasa is a brand called *Dutch Brand*, which I believe is available in the extended Detroit area.  Exceptional after being fried in a tablespoon of butter.

Probably should have mixed the mashed potatoes and sauerkraut before adding, as I couldn't get enough filling it to make it not 75% dough.  Incredibly underwhelmed for the time and effort I put into it, though with the sausage/sauerkraut/potatoes it averaged out to tasted really well."

Let's just say everything about SalsaShark's comments, his phrasing, his tone, his word choice, lead me to the believe that he wouldn't consider learning to write poetry, sculpt or tend a garden to be the sort of pursuits one would engage in to ""become one's best.""

I think to be one's best one has to be more than strong, one has to be wise and intelligent as well.  Let's just say wise and intelligent people don't ask questions like ""How else would it be defined?"" and they certainly don't dismiss them with rhetorical questions like ""Being the best at Gears of War?""

His initial comment was also a pretty stereotypical example male insecurity.  One has to ask about the motives of someone who brags about how he works out and doesn't care what anyone thinks in a thread about body image issues.  It's little too Captain Try-Hard."

Spend the offseason running huge amounts of mileage. NO workouts; Just distance. For someone who's going to be a junior, I'd say about 60 mpw is good. Be sure to vary how you run, and take 1 day off every other week to either rest or cross train. About 1 month before season starts, start workouts. Take it easy at first, and start to cut your mileage slightly. (55 mpw) As the season progresses, make your workouts shorter and faster, be sure to vary your workouts, and get some fartleks and track work done. Finally, 10 days before what you would consider your biggest race, start cutting mileage by about 33% (36 MPW) Do very short and easy workouts, (4 x 800's at tempo mile pace, 1 minute 10k race pace, 1 minute easy) and &lt;6 mile distance runs.

SnowLeepord,seduction,1389588340.0,"Grinding is a little more difficult than that as a boy.

As a girl who likes going out and dancing, if we're grinding you have to keep up.

Some girls booty bounce, which is more like twerking against someone. This is one of those you just have to push up against her so it doesn't feel like you two are falling.

The other is hip rolling. You should place a hand somewhere around her hip(s) and follow along to the beat she's choosen. If you're particularly comfortable with dancing you can change the movement order/ choreography. 

Then some things just get very devolved.

She's bending over and twerking against you. Most guys just kinda thrust back. This is always little graphic for me.

If you front grind, you can... well..  Just match up to her movements.

It's a lot like sex. Basically don't let the girl do all the work. If I can push you down using my movements, you need to push up harder. If I roll or bounce try to go with it. Or change it up and I'll follow. 

My favorite is the guy who adds a little leg movement to a hip roll. It takes on a more spanish dancing feel, than dirty club dancing.

Clockw0rk,Games,1389588368.0,"So, the problem with 'modern military shooters' is that it's not only their genre but their setting. You could reboot Spyro with another handful of fantasy worlds, you can keep throwing Ratchet and Clank at new planets, Mario and Sonic will always have some new continent/world/galaxy to run through. But your war based first person shooters are pretty much restricted to wars that have already happened or could possible happen given certain circumstances.

Arguably, Black Ops was one of the best chances that CoD had of breathing some new life into itself. Adding plausible near future tech and alternate history versions of some less popular conflicts lets the story play around a bit while also giving new toys to the multiplayer. 

Unfortunately, the military shooter market has become more of a weird year long life cycle MMO rather than a traditional game model. Mod support has been killed, dedicated servers are no-go, expansion packs add a few new areas and other minor changes every two to four months and then the sequel comes out, largely killing the player base of the previous version.

What the industry really needs is the next Unreal Tournament. Agile warriors with interesting tech in interesting locations that lend themselves to objective or death match based play. And I'm talking classic Unreal Tournament, before the vehicles. UT took a strange battlefield-ish turn before fading to Gears of War imposter death. I don't know how it ever got out of planning stages, but turning a twitch based shooter and making all the characters and vehicles feel like clunky tanks is obviously not going to play well.

I wouldn't mind if CoD took a Command and Conquer turn and gave us new factions with new nations rather than the 'what foreign power is the US afraid of this week?' route they've been beating to death. Keep it fast, keep it light, keep aliens and space travel out of it. You can make compelling future earth conflicts without turning it into Halo.

Obviously a strong engine would help things quite a bit. More pre-scripted set pieces are alright, as long as they mesh well with real game physics and effects. I think volumetric smoke and lighting could add a ton to close quarters mechanics, and I think thin material balistics as well as destructible walls add layers of complexity to the otherwise well played out concrete corridors of yesteryear. 

TL;DR:

* Improved physics engine
* New setting with new factions/weapons
* Dedicated servers
* Mod support (you can support mods and release expansion packs, see classic battlefield)
* Maintain focus on agile player combat, vehicle roles should be limited
* Tighter focus on unlock / perk balance
* Persistent player stats viewable online (like an MMO armory)
* Cross-platform/game account support; franchise loyalty carries rewards like early unlocks

If CoD ghosts has any of this, I apologize for my negligence.. but I certainly haven't heard these things out of the fanbase or press so far."

ebonlance,Warmachine,1389588400.0,"Mauler/Mauler/Pyre just seems like a really redundant battlegroup. The Champions are nice but you desperately need some Pathfinder. I'd take an Axer over the Pyre, and cut the second Mauler altogether.

All in all this just seems like a really weird list. I see no reason to ever take anything but Max Boomies and your battlegroup is way more than you can reliably support without letting expensive elements frenzy. 

If you intend to go with champ-block Borka I'd do something like:

Borka 
Mauler 9 (4)
Axer 6

Max Champs 10
Min Champs 6
Fenns plus UA 10
Max Stone  + UA 5
Troll Champ Hero 3
Fell Caller 3
Chronicler 2
Gobbers 1

This gives you a lot of adaptability. ARM 16, DEF 15, concealment-covered Fenns or Champs are an excellent front line, and they can get stuck in quickly and effectively on minifeat turn. The Fell Caller makes the Fenns MAT 8 or gives Champs pathfinder, and the Chronicler can make dealing with Iron Fleshed fenns a goddamn nightmare to deal with once they're engaging an enemy. Moshpit greatly enhances assassination attempts and Borka is damn near unkillable himself.

Your battlegroup gives you decent utility. A mauler under mosh pit and rage will kill anything it can reach. The Axer can give a critical pathfinder charge and movement bonus. Both can be protected fairly easily with the KSB and Wind Wall until they need to engage.  "

GeoffreyArnold,SubredditDrama,1389588482.0,"[Here is one of the better studies about the affect of height on social perceptions and prejudice.](https://gustavus.edu/psychology/files/Anderson.pdf) (warning: .pdf)

**Abstract:**

The present study investigated the effect of gender, height, and awareness of height on person perception. Participants (39 male, 37 female) rated male and female silhouettes of short, average and tall height on seven personality dimensions: social attractiveness, professional success, personal adjustment, athleticism, masculinity, femininity and physical attractiveness. Overall, tall and average targets were rated significantly higher than short targets on all dimensions
except for femininity, in which short targets were rated significantly higher. There was no main effect for awareness of height on personality ratings, but short and tall participants reported significantly higher height awareness than average height participants. The findings provided
further support for the liabilities of being short and imply a need to further investigate the stereotypes of height.

[And here is one of the better papers dealing with just employment discrimination based on height.](http://www.timothy-judge.com/Height%20paper--JAP%20published.pdf) (warning: .pdf)  

**Abstract:** 

In this article, the authors propose a theoretical model of the relationship between physical height and career success. We then test several linkages in the model based on a meta-analysis of the literature, with results indicating that physical height is significantly related to measures of social esteem (.41), leader emergence (.24), and performance (.18). Height was somewhat more strongly related to
success for men (.29) than for women (.21), although this difference was not significant. Finally, given that almost no research has examined the relationship between individuals’ physical height and their incomes, we present four large-sample studies (total N = 8,590) showing that height is positively related to income (.26) after controlling for sex, age, and weight. 

Overall, this article presents the most comprehensive analysis of the relationship of height to workplace success to date, and the results
suggest that tall individuals have advantages in several important aspects of their careers and organizational lives."

What was scary for me was, I couldn't speak as my mouth was completely numb save for the roof of my mouth, I also remember this sensation on my tongue... the only way I can describe it is it felt like the [Marching Hammers](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tAI3zxOvsG4/Tviz49Wh95I/AAAAAAAAAfs/X2CP3C_Oot0/s1600/Pink-floyd-hammers.jpg) from The Wall, and I also will never forget the taste: like rancid mint. 

What concerned me the most was the fact my throat and my chest were numb. The only thing I could feel was my heart and it's every intricacy. I actually became very scared because I could feel my heart constricting and relaxing and *blood* going in and out. I was equally disgusted. 

I couldn't keep my eyes open either, but when they were closed it was pitch black, and I was in a forest of cactus that were made of neon lights... and I was being followed by an neon lighted owl as well.

It could we be that the hypothetical union, could perhaps use the argument of people voting for self-determination in which ""state"" they would be nominally under, or within the European superstate could give a nominal independence under the EU flag to disputed territories, thus potentially dropping the issue...
Its is difficult and any proposed integrated union must allow a for disputes such as these to be fully discussed and agreed upon before entering.

Agreed that a simple majority would probably be difficult...
In regards to the UN, I feel that both UK and France are punching above their weight to be full-time members on the security council, with there historic empires and ownership of Nukes being the only reason they are on the council, I feel that with the growth of the other BRICS economies, specifically India and Brazil, pushing to be on the Council, the only way that UK and France could logically stay on the Council would be to united into a single seat, and in the proposed United EU, it would be one seat, with an EU state taking it, neither UK or France.

I feel that the red tape issue is something that needs to be addressed, and would run significantly smoother with a greater union towards the EU parliament and less on national governments but agreed as of this point it is pretty ridiculous.

I agree with the idea that your more likely to spend on something that benefits you directly and not on something that doesn't, so maybe it would be that the integrated EU, would allow for easier negotiation between parties directly involved, with the possibility of a large EU pot, which would only be used for projects which affect the whole union, or for emergencies maybe.

But, I did just move, and decluttered a lot of things. I also do a lot of different crafts, from oil painting to beadwork so... I have a lot of art things. 

One thing that helped was planning to have an 'art space' in my new home. I have a large chest (maybe 3.5' x 2.5'x2.5') that I use to store fabric, bead craft things and acrylic paints. My other art supplies I went through and figured out what was still good, and what wasn't. Some were just too dried up and unusable, but most were good. Those were put into their own art bin, along with my roll of brushes. I have an art 'tackle box' that I use for acrylics, and a larger box for oils, and a shoebox for sculpey. All those things fit into one large storage bin that tucks away under my craft table when not in use. I didn't end up getting rid of a ton of art supplies, but I did make an effort to organize what I had, and that has helped a lot. 

For old sketchbooks, I got a waterproof storage box and they have their own shelf in the garage where they won't be ruined, but are still out of the way. While I realize that scanning them etc. is better, I'm just not willing to part with 20+ years of my history as an artist, so they stay, just in a much more cared for fashion. "

A couple years ago, a close friend of mine told me she thought masturbation was gross and something only lonely, pathetic people did. So, I agree that it’s personal, but I do think it’s important to affirm to others that it’s something wonderful and healthy and okay, especially to offset the negative attitudes still being passed around in some circles.

It is kind of hard to explain, basically it is not like an ""itch"" that you have to scratch, but a repetitive thing you have to do.

Imagine if you felt like you had to clear your throat or shrug your shoulders at a random time, just for no reason, but you feel like it is necessary. The more you think about it, the more you do it.

I'm about to start a novel with a similar main character (who is not the narrator), completely not aware that he's gay.

An unlocked door doesn't require a key, but when you are on someone's property, you are unauthorized to enter it unless otherwise stated. Also, web addresses are just like addresses in real life. There is nothing about them that is intrinsically public. By far, the massive majority of IP addresses accessible at any time are to people's private computers and phones. And accessing any of those devices by going through a logging in process where you happen not to be prompted for a password, and where the username is a common default, is illegal. 

Honestly, it's a little frightening just how misinformed most people here seem to be about how legal access on the internet works. 

If you feel comfortable giving out the state or country you're in, I could point you towards specific laws on the matter. There are international agreements and established rules that everyone on the internet has to adhere to as well, but you aren't really going to be prosecuted under those if your local laws say otherwise.

Second, keep studying. Was that a fully timed practice test? If it isn't, you should consider timing official tests, and don't expect that to be your score. Although, your general average range, if you do enough tests, should adequately reflect what you will receive. I was scoring 166-172 for my general range, and received a 168.  

Now, can that GPA be recovered? Oh yes. Your LSAT can far make up from it. I don't think GT ED is necessarily the best choice, because you may not get a lot of money and that is a substantial amount of debt to take without considering other choices (plus you'd have no negotiation room). But, it can be done. I didn't apply to any T14 because I knew they wouldn't give me a better deal than my home-state school: Texas.

It was 500 against my lowly 150, but I had good enough tactics to almost even out the numbers, and my army was stacked with Vaegir Marksmen and Nord Huscarls because I'd recently done some sieging. 

I found a hill, got on it, and waited. The Huscarls formed a shield wall for the archers, who made bloody work of the slowly advancing enemy. My small cavalry retinue, about 12 companions and Sarranid Mamlukes, quietly moved to the side of the map. When the enemy respawned, the cavalry waited until they were at the foot of the hill before charging in from the rear and destroying them. I then signaled the ""all charge"" order to meet the next wave head-on, reforming afterward at a point within range of their spawn point. After that it was pure slaughter. I wound up getting slightly better odds with every ensuing chapter of the battle until I finally gained my glorious victory. 

I lost more than half my troops in total, and more than half those remaining were sorely wounded. *But I captured the foul king Yaroglek* and some nice armor, and my Mamlukes captured a ton of enemies as well. It was my finest (M&amp;B) effort."

The drop arm test: this is one of the tests that can help to diagnose a rotator cuff tear. If your doctor carries out this test they will ask you to stand with your arm by your side. They will lift your arm outwards from your side and up towards your head. They will then ask you to move your arm back down slowly towards your side. In a rotator cuff tear, you are usually able to lower your arm slowly to 90° but when you try to lower your arm below 90°, it drops quickly to your side because of the tear.

If you lie about something stupid to cover your ass, it means you'll lie about something bigger, so tell your SO the truth no matter what from this point on. 

You also have to accept that your girlfriend may not always believe you, and it will take a lot of time to gain her trust again. Every woman who interacts with you just became her enemy, and her competition for your attention. Don't get mad at her for it, just keep the lines of communication open and reassure her about your feelings. 

Like everyone else here is suggesting- never communicate with M ever again. Ever. and if she contacts you, don't hide it. Tell your SO, and explain that you want to prove you aren't hiding anything. 

Most of all, show your SO how you feel by treating her the way you think she deserves to be treated. You don't have to be a sad puppy, but if you've been with her for 2 years, you know her. You know whats going to put a smile on her face and make her light up. You know what little gestures get to her.

It can be helpful to reach past the question to see what you can learn about how they understand the subject matter from how they phrase the question. So someone asking about ""before the Big Bang"" doesn't understand the nature of time. I try to politely ask a rephrased question to see if it helps.

*Your* question might be politely rephrased as:

""This sub seems to be /r/AnsweringQuestionsWithoutJudgement - are there any times when the sub struggles with that?""

My answer to *that* question is: questions about faith or religion are hard.

&gt;[What makes Holy Water different than regular water?](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1rdvbb/what_makes_holy_water_different_than_regular_water/)

...had about half the comments deleted.

There was another question about ""diluting holy water"" that I can't find now. Even if you put yourself in the shoes of a theist, which flavor? Catholics are the obvious choice but lots of other traditions have holy water. Worse, in terms of importance to Catholicism, holy water seems closer to ""# angels dancing on a pin"" than ""Jesus died for our sins.""

So to answer you need to assume a faith (Catholics are probably the biggest that care about holy water) and then tease out an answer about something a priest or bishop or scholar might not have the answer to. All without judgement, *without* saying: ""how much can holy water be diluted is a stupid question about a stupid notion (water being blessed) based on a stupid idea (religion.)"" And without letting those feelings color the answers."

While I agree that getting over the established national identities would be hard, but surely not impossible, I mean people in America talk about which state they are from and how they are different, but ultimately they all say they are American? Doesn't the west coast balk at federal funding being used for Hurricane damage on the East coast? sure there might be some muttering but as long as the others know that they would get the same help, sure that can be overcome with time?

Agreed that America had it easy and every point you said makes complete sense. What I would hope is that the countries in Europe would see the long term benefit, A united Europe would have a lot more strength all moving together as one, then in different directions individually.

I feel that yes it would be nigh-impossible to do, due to many of the problems presented but I still feel it would be the right course to ultimately take, and I doubt it would lead to war, the World is getting more peaceful by the day and we Europeans remember well the destruction of WW1 and WW2 to the continent, so if it failed, it would just collapse, very unlikely war.
If anything I feel that the current EU is causing more divides among Europe than this hypothetical one would, with the German's muttering angrily about Greece and the UK going literally nuts over perceived immigration explosion, that a more united political Europe would understand this as pretty normal. with it being seen as moving across the ""country"" looking for employment as opposed to ""Der took me jobs"" we have at the moment in the UK."

I got it in 97, so I was 9 at the time. The instructions told me that to throw, I press A, and then B, C&lt;, C down **or** C&gt; to select receivers. I made two mistakes:

1. I always chose a passing play with no receiver mapped to B, and 
2. I thought it said AND, not OR...

So I thought to pass, I had to press A, B, and then all three C buttons. What does that do? Drop back to pass. B cancels the pass (since no receiver was mapped to the B route). Then I juked left (C&lt;) and dove (C down). Again and again and again (because I wanted to run that play and I did not understand why it didn't work).

Every. Fucking. Time.

And:

&gt; Yeahhhh I feel like such an over privileged you-know-what thinking that, but I have a pretty hard time classifying anyone whose primary source of income is wages as remarkably wealthy.

Whether he deserved those or not is another matter.

&gt; The gold-diggers part was probably a matter of disagreement over a definition. When someones mentiones a gold-digger I usually imagine girls fawning over guys driving Ferraris and BMWs, which are beyond the salary of the average doctor.

Neither are beyond the salary of an average doctor. An average low-end or mid-range Ferrari can be anywhere from 200k to 400k. It's a horrible choice from a financial point of view, but not exactly that difficult to save for or go into debt to buy (and pay off in a few years or so) if you're a doctor.

A BMW is nothing. Every other white collar worker around me rides in a BMW, even people I know who've barely even broke the 100k salary threshold. You probably mean something more specific, because prices can range from just 32k to over 150k."

I started texting/messaging my now boyfriend while I was in the breakup process of my ex. He made me realize that I deserved more, and I could be with someone awesome and someone who cares about my well-being. He was my incentive, my reward to breaking up with my ex. So I pretty much moved right from one to the other. Looking back, it may have been healthier to have some me-time after a tumultuous relationship, but I show no long-term damage from moving on so quickly. My long-term problems from that relationship don't reflect at all on my current relationships or how I see myself. I don't really have huge trust issues or anything anymore.

ThePinkPanther2,AskWomen,1389589946.0," I've had friends in the past who have said that I don't seem capable enough to do maintenance work but fuck them and their wrong assumptions. Having a ""girly"" appearance does not mean I won't roll up my sleeves and help with maintaining my home. 

My mother has taught me well. My long list of accomplishments: I've replaced a faucet, put new rollers on a sliding glass door, patched walls, changed air filters, unclogged bathroom drains, cleaned gutters, fixed sprinklers, built Ikea furniture (does that count?), built a mailbox post, spent a few days re-sodding the lawn (my mother said it was punishment for having no summer plans), sponge painted walls, caulked the bathroom tiles, pressure washed the drive way, organized the garage, cleaned silver..

If I don't know how to do something then I will damn well google it before calling a repairman for the DIY stuff. My pride and frugal sensibilities are on the line. Not to mention, I wouldn't want anyone to feel overburdened with the responsibility unless there was a fair tradeoff of some sort. 

My neighbor was surprised that I was putting air in my tires. Every time I get on a ladder to fix the garage door, he has to stop on by and make some backhanded compliment. Nice guy but sometimes I want to strangle him. 

Also, I unloaded trucks for several months. That was part of my job. I mean, heavy furniture: king sized headboards, dining room sets, oak wood desks. We get in anywhere from 300 to 700 boxes every Thursday. This includes: clothing, decor items, 16piece ceramic dishware sets, metal scaffolding ladders, chainsaws, scrapbook paper, giant turkey friars, ect. 

My boyfriend thought that meant it was small and light boxes - hell fucking no. We might sell tiny items like dog toys and slippers but they're ALL packaged ""lightly"", meaning a big heavy box jam packed with a mix of stuff..like 3 foot cement statues or crystal vases ..  

All my coworkers have said that I'm the best stacker they've had in a long time - I don't throw boxes into a big heap .. I fit them nice and neatly. I enjoyed it because it was like Tetris.  When I became a key holder and stopped unloading trucks, that was a sad day. It was back breaking work but it was fun. "

And yeah, I've experienced the ""cult like"" Michigan following. There's a surprising amount of people who love Michigan in northeast Ohio, and they're insanely dedicated to the school. But I can respect that - I'm glad/hopeful that Umich is someplace to be proud of (it seems like it, from everything I've seen).


I'm really considering a philosophy major too (instead of economics, not in addition to, lol). Umich philosophy undergraduate is particularly strong, you say? I've found it difficult to find rankings online that talk about the comparative strength of philosophy undergraduate programs (there's that philosophicalgourmet website or w/e, but it just ranks schools based on the amount of citations their faculty receive).

I'd really love going into philosophy and don't doubt Umich is strong at all, but I've heard from a few philosophy professors that ""unless you go to a 'top tier' philosophy undergrad (which is generally defined as ivies+chicago+stanford+duke), might as well just not try to get a phd, because you won't get into a good grad school and no universities will hire you"". This is pretty disheartening, because a lot of good schools' (with departments probably as strong or better than the ones I listed) students lose out just because their degree isn't ""prestigious enough"".

So I'd be really scared about majoring in philosophy/applying to philosophy grad school programs. Do you think Umich students are very competitive for grad school in philosophy? If you know about the department, can you speak to its strengths? If it helps, I'm particularly interested in moral philosophy.

EDIT: my friend (at umich) also loves philosophy but said umich's program ""was shit"". It turns out he just meant they focus on analytical philosophy, and he prefers continental philosophy (I prefer analytical), so he meant it as a joke (he said he didn't know how strong it was, in reality) - he is hoping to get a PhD in econ so he doesn't have huge experience with the philosophy program anyway.

Thanks again!"

audreyshake,AskWomen,1389590044.0,"I don’t disagree with you, but I do have one anomaly to share: [Ms. Tori Amos performed her song *Icicle* on national television in 1994.](&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53uqoLpnuGA&gt;) Why is this relevant? As she explained:

&gt; I am a minister’s daughter, for heaven’s sake! So, of course, I can see why some would regard sexual fantasies about Jesus Christ as unacceptable. But that’s part of what I’m saying in *Icicle*, when I tell of how I used to masturbate at home as a teenager, while my father and his fellow theologians were downstairs discussing the Divine Light. I was exploring the “divine light” within myself. And anyone who sees that as “blasphemous” can go to hell! Like I said to you before, that’s how women are paralysed, disconnected from their own power by religion. Talk about patriarchal power structures. For centuries the Church has slammed a crucifix between a woman’s legs and even masturbation obviously is a way of dislodging that cross, of self-empowerment. And how dare anybody say that my honouring my woman-ness in that way, my relationship with my own body and my opening to this energy between my legs is a “sin against God” is “blasphemous.” That was my act of defiance, of asserting myself against the oppressive force of religion which has always made women deny their sexuality.

&gt; The concept is that Jesus Christ, through the Father, Son and Holy Spirit experienced life—the human form. Well, what I find quite inexplicable is that he could suckle at a woman’s breast yet not soil his dinky by having sex! How’s he supposed to experience life at the level of his dick, for Christ’s sake! That’s the Church’s core denial of sexuality, right there, alongside the idea that Mary could give birth without “doing it.” It’s absurd. So when I say I want to “do it” with Jesus Christ it’s not just that I want to sexualise Jesus, bring him down to our level: I want to breathe the earth into his lungs. He came from Heaven and we, as women, come from the earth. So it’s the idea of soil beneath the fingers, the notion of, “If this blood is sacred, then drink it.” That’s what it’s all about.

redwhiskeredbubul,TheBluePill,1389590046.0,"I can see the distinction, but I am still very skeptical. I'd also take issue with the characterization of anthropology as a field of research as metaphysical, at least in the crude sense of the term: there are a number of arguments for human distinctiveness, such as natural language. Whether modern linguistics is metaphysical in some deeper sense (_pace_ Derrida, etc.) could be debated, but that's neither here nor there. 

Neither Frost nor Cochrane have full-time academic appointments, though  the stuff on Frost's blog looks less nutty at a glance than the paper that was cited earlier. Harpending is a reputable guy but it doesn't look like he's published in an anthropology journal in a while. Also, his statement about research interests says nothing about HBD. 

EDIT: some of Frost's stuff is pretty dubious, and he seems to be citing the same people as in the earlier cited journal. Never mind the comments.  

EDIT 2: Todd is a perfectly reputable scholar (he's quite eminent) but I don't see what the linked map has to do with race. I can see a vague, loose  correlation to ethnolinguistic groups that existed prior to the modern nation-state in Europe (Brittany shows up in france, etc.) "

Vooxie,ADHD,1389590114.0,"I had a really hard time with homework when I was in school and I know that ""invisible force"" very, very well.  
  
I was horrible about homework in high school, but in college I discovered a few tricks that helped me out.  
  
1.) I physically took myself to an area that was designated for homework. For me, this area was the library. I knew if I was in my dorm room I just couldn't get anything done. It's where I slept, goofed around, surfed the internet, etc. The library was mentally designated as homework time and I purposely sat on the ""no-talking"" floors. Years later when I was studying for the GMAT, a quiet coffee shop was my go-to spot for studying. When I tried to stay home and study, I never got anything done. 
  
2.) I tried to bring only what I needed with me. When I was in college, I didn't have a laptop, which I think is very helpful to being able to tune out distractions. If you're only doing math homework, you probably don't need a laptop. If you're just doing reading, you probably only need your book.   
  
3.) Coffee.  
  
4.) I started with the homework that I enjoyed the most. I did really well with math problems. They're relatively short. There are a lot of them and they're all a little different. They involve lots of active thinking. Math problems got my mind engaged.   
  
I also really liked reading for history and English classes. The stories were usually interesting. Sometimes I'd zone out, but I discovered how to actively read (and summarize what I was reading as I was reading it). Sometimes starting with these things that I already enjoyed doing got me in a zone and it became easy to transition to assignments that I hated.  
  
I was *horrible* when it came to writing papers. I've heard a lot of different techniques about just write ANYTHING. (Stream of consciousness style.) Or just start writing the body of the paper and worry about the introduction later. I don't know, I always ended up leaving papers until the last minute. However, I did notice that I worked better in the mornings than at night. Sometimes the time of day for when you decide to do your work helps.   

Good luck!

In class, there was a person that was talking about how they were raped, they were very withheld about it and the teacher wanted to talk to them to help them through their emotional problems. (I was in a ""sped"" class)

So im sitting there, thinking about something stupid, I hear the super serious and important conversation and it is like a que for my brain to say ""WOO HOO ITS TIME TO START LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY!""

I interrupted the conversation and felt bad about it, but I *could not* stop laughing."

You said you like French, minoring in that could open doors for you to work in French speaking countries so I'd give that a bit of thought.

madhjsp,nfl,1389590643.0,"**Favorites:**    

Scott Hanson - How has this not been said yet in this thread? Dude's a machine! 

Mike Mayock - Very insightful and I like his overall analysis style.

Al &amp; Chris - Lots of other people have said this already, but they have a good chemistry. Obviously, both are also pretty knowledgeable and don't make a lot of mistakes.  

Gruden &amp; Tirico - Also a popular response here, but yeah, this is a good pairing. Gruden's a total character, and Tirico is one of the most fluid play-by-play guys out there, in any sport. Great pacing to his calls, and he gets appropriately excited to match the action on the field.  

Ian Eagle &amp; Dan Fouts - They tend to do a lot of Titans games for some reason. It almost feels like they've become our assigned CBS crew, and I've grown to like them. 

Mike Keith - Titans radio guy. Sometimes I prefer stream his call over the TV broadcast if I can get it to sync right.  

Paul Allen - Vikings radio guy. He's such a homer, but his calls when the Vikings do something cool are really, really exciting. 

**Least Favorite:**  

Joe Buck - He's just so dull."

Not really, it just means that we need to change how we do things and get away from our obsession with work ethic and ""earning a living.""

&gt;just drawing it down drastically with a lower birth rate

This will likely happen naturally, and in some places, already is taking effect. Most first world countries have birth rates below the replacement rate. This is partially due to careers and partially due to birth control.

Honestly, we can take care of everyone's basic needs as long as population doesnt spiral out of control in the first world, and it shouldn't based on current trends. I'm more worried about the environmental impacts though, since we're doing a lot of harm to the environment with our massive production and transportation systems built around nasty fossil fuels."
TofuRobber,AskMen,1389590685.0,"OK, here's the plan. You get all your friends together including the couple in question. Maybe throw a party at your place. You hang out, have some fun, and then when the opportunity arises, you stand up. 

You make a speech. You tell then how much to trust them and how much you care about them. You can even add some nostalgic bits with some of your friends. ""Hey, Bob, remember that one time when we went out drinking and I got waste. You really took care of me. Karin, remember that time when I lost my car keys and you had to give me a ride home."" You tell them how much it means to you that they were willing to do that for you, no matter how small it was. You tell them a few things you feel really bad about, like stealing money or keeping a stupid lie from them (I actually don't like that band, or, I really hate when you guys talk about cars). But you realize that you shouldn't have to lie to them. You say you're sorry for keeping such stupid things from them and you realize that you're better than that. That they're better than that and that they'd understand why you didn't want them to know. It was embarrassing for you. You get everybody really emotional and then you make a toast to friendship, and trust, and having each others' back. You tell them you'd never betray their trust if you can help it and if you ever do they have all the rights to judge you like scum but they should also realize that it goes both ways. If you ever find out that they have done something that you just can't forgive then you reserve the right to lose all respect for them. But you trust them, trust them so much that you know they'd never do something like that to you, or anybody else in the group.

And after all this. After the toast. You casually glance at the wife, you look into her eyes, stare at her. Not long, but long enough that you she knows this is really all about her and then you look away. And she will be crying, she will break down. She will be filled up with so much remorse that she becomes unintelligible.

You then go up to her, give her a hug, tell her that she's not along. Her friends are here with her, and most importantly, her loving husband, the husband that has been with her and who is raising two lovely child with her.

After all this, she'd have to tell her husband the truth. And if she doesn't, you do. Because you said that you would. You said that you'd never betray them if you can help it and will treat them like scum if they did something you can't forgive them for.

Scarcer,buildapc,1389590699.0,"&gt;Im not trying to argue with you but just give some insight. To say that the 780ti isnt worth it if you get the stock cooler is a bit of an over exaggeration. Sure it cant overclock like the 780ti ghz or classified but those also have a price premium as well.

This is mostly gabbing and doesn't represent the price to performance ratio.

I don't buy the argument of spending a large fraction more for a small return in performance. Lets look at the numbers.

Here is the [Model](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-video-card-gvn780ghz3gd) I've refered to. It's relatively new so there's little information regarding reviews.

As a place holder, lets use the slightly slower [Galaxy GTX 780 HOF](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-video-card-03gp43788kr)

[Review 1](http://www.hardocp.com/article/2013/08/14/galaxy_geforce_gtx_780_hof_edition_review/1#.UtNqDfRDvSs)

[Review 2](http://hexus.net/tech/reviews/graphics/60001-kfa2-geforce-gtx-780-hall-of-fame/)

Now that we have established that for $520 USD, there are 780 models that compete head to head with a Titan at factory speeds, and may even exceed the Titan if OC'd (but honestly what % of average gamers OC their cards), you must ask; how does it compare to the 780 ti?

*We all know that the 780 ti has a marginal performance improvement above the Titan, though what really makes the 780 ti good is it's price to performance ratio compared to the titan.* So don't make me dig for the data.

[Here's the cheapest 780 Ti available](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-gtx780ti3gd5) at $685.

**Is a 'potential' 1/4 tier power increment worth the $165 difference?** Even if you OC? (The reference blower HSF's sound like turbine engines anyway, drives me nuts while gaming.) 

&gt;Sure it cant overclock like the 780ti ghz or classified **but those also have a price premium as well.**

The point of paying premium for a better product is to get a relevant performance benefit, if you really want better performance and have the money to spend; you may as well be buying a custom HSF/OC Model in the first place.

Much less, why insist on arguing about this when the guy will be playing on 1080p anyway?

* ""Well what if he wants to go 1440p instead?""

In which case I still stand by my price/performance argument, and saving money on the GPU and Case in such a situation would make a 1440p easier to afford.

---

&gt;And to call the haf x mediocre is also a bit insulting to the case.

Being reasonable has nothing to do with insulting an inanimate product in a competitive market.

&gt;having owned the haf x I can tell you that it is a much better built case

That's fine, I'm not stopping anyone from getting that case; but that's not stopping me from having a voice of reason. I don't care if a case is built strong enough use as a chair because that's not the intended purpose. Realistically the only stand-apart feature it has is the GPU support bracket, which I personally would make use of if I had the case after modifying a GPU with a heavy HSF. But let's not pretend that either the HAF X (or 750D for reference) are designed for LAN parties, or even being moved around. Once built, they will sit there; right where they belong.

&gt;It comes with 3 huge 200mm fans and is covered in mesh as you said. Thats some pretty good stock airflow if you ask me.

Size isn't everything. The larger the case, the more air flow you need to get the same air pressure in theory, but without actual testing hardware this becomes speculation.

Cool Master cases summed up: Tight Mesh = Tacky/Messy/Increased Noise (**though the 200mm fans as you mention would help considerably for the Haf X**)

I could go on about it but it's pointless.

Again, I never said the Haf X is bad, but it isn't worth $200 for someone who buys just an ATX motherboard, with hardly over $1000 to spend on components much less $2000. It amounts to cutting the muffler off of a 90's Honda and driving around the neighborhood. 

There's much more appropriate C/M cases under $100."

&gt; Gold-diggers are **usually** looking for someone well beyond the 1%, like that classic post[1] from a woman looking for men earning over 500k.

Look, if that was your only point, you'd find that I actually agree with much of that. In that rp thread, I wrote a long-ass post about how an endocrinologist makes about 250k annually and is within the top 1% single filers in the US, and probably within the top 0.05% of the world.

No where close to ""old wealth"", but I disagree that he'd be immune to gold-diggers, as I think the behaviours lie in a spectrum and aren't binary. That weak ""*usually*"" qualifier in your description of gold-diggers shows that you already know this. 

I've seen that classic post in the past, and it doesn't really help your point. As I explained on more than one occasion in that thread, it's very much relative. That 250k salary is going to mean much more outside Manhattan or the Silicon Valley, maybe as much as or more than that 500k is going to mean right on Wall Street.

&gt; I think that was the point of the posters in /r/AskWomen[2] .

Again, if that was your only point from the beginning, we wouldn't have any disagreements. It sounds to me though, that as we continue this, you'll be less and less intellectually honest.

You were initially confused. I explained that a lot of the guys in that thread were simply ridiculing the AskWomen responses that made light of the OP's situation. I explained that the top responses have changed over time which might be the cause of your confusion.

You even agree in some of your comments to others here that doctors are wealthy enough and that being wealthy is an obvious boon. So on some level, you do disagree with what were the top comments on the AW thread. "

Riali,ABraThatFits,1389591312.0,"Ok, so good news is, if you're about to have a baby, you probably don't have to worry about these two bras anymore, because once your milk comes in/ribcage contracts again, they most likely won't fit anyway.  However, it's sounding more and more like you just have short rooted, high set breasts, which is a tricky shape, from what I've seen.  The Motherhood sounds like it's digging into your tail of spence, and the target's wires are distorting, which shouldn't happen with a looseish band, but it would not surprise me one bit to learn that Target's bras are not the best quality.  Honestly, at this point, I'd find something stretchy and lounge-like and comfy until your milk stabilizes (or your breasts are feeling like themselves again if you're not breastfeeding this time), and then measure again.  Hopefully at that point someone will have some low wire suggestions (I don't, sorry) or you can do some in depth bratabase comparisons.  I've never done the pregnancy thing, so you or someone who has might have more accurate ideas, but I'd think that comfort is key at this point, and with the changes that are going to happen with birth etc, a wired bra is just too static to work.  There is a nursing bra guide in the sidebar under ""Specialty Bras"", which is definitely worth a read if haven't yet!

Sorry I'm not more immediate help, good luck and safe delivery!"

they could make it so that going a while without dying gives (possibly stacking) bonus to gold/drops/whatever. instead of taking away some of the players gold on death. then make everything equivalently more expensive. the end is the same but players rejoice and feel good when they get their multiplier high rather than frustrated when they died a couple times and can hardly afford repairs."

Above what the regular navy must carry for nuclear war preparation, the Reagan must be festooned with radiation detection equipment of its own: the ship has two nuclear reactors and, lets face it, the designers have to face the reality that a conventional attack (a big missile) could break containment on one of the two onboard reactors.

Today was the first day since I was born, that I have touched my eyebrows with something other than a finger.     
I've slowly started to hate my natural, ever untouched eyebrows during the past year. I felt like they weighed my eyes down.    

So after joining this subreddit and also MakeupAddiction subreddit, I finally made up my mind and bought Too Faced Brow Envy kit.    
I then spent almost a week psyching myself up to do the deed.

And today, well, today, I spent 2 and a half hour in front of a mirror, and I have the *most fantastic eyebrows* I couldn't even imagine! I am so happy! And I did it all myself, without any tutorials, or youtube videos. Just Too Faced, a mirror and I.

It feels friggin fantastic :D

Looks and personality (basically everything except looks) are completely separate issues. A guy has to separately meet my standards in both. And neither makes up for a weakness in the other.

Ratings are subjective, but I would say I am open to dating 8/10 and above. There are certain specific attributes I look for: height (at least 5'10""), fit toned body with very low body fat %, average or above average penis size, no thinning hair or receding hairline, fair skin, and very handsome face. Bonuses for blue or green eyes.

For personality: highly intelligent, scientific mind, atheist or at least hard agnostic, similar values and life goals, similar political principles (the details can differ, but I need to respect his political views), not ignorant sheltered or excessively idealistic, very secure in himself, hard working, has his shit together (got his career and finances figured out, can take care of himself, generally competent at life), open to non-traditional gender roles (willing to sacrifice his career for mine, and wants to be primary caregiver for the  kids).

I don't care about money, as long as he is responsible with it. I am totally fine with having a kept husband -- but he can't spend everything I make and drive us into a financial black hole. And he needs to take care of the kidlets.

**TL;DR**: No, common consensus in reddit is that Whalberg is an ass that hasn't paid for his crimes and people who hate JB are childish."
AccountHaver25,TwoXChromosomes,1389592217.0,"&gt; I'm sorry you're getting downvoted

Thank you.... I guess.

&gt; you're 100% right. Until this new Pope's words are backed up with actual changes in Church policy, it's all a bunch of fluffy, feel-good PR bullshit as far as I'm concerned.

That's one thing people don't realize. The Catholic Church isn't just a church but its internal policy affects many Catholic-dominated countries especially in the Third World. What's he telling them? Having gay attraction is okay but gay sex/relationships/marriage is bad.

Think about in the context of every country in the world that has banned homosexuality. They aren't banning gay attraction but acting on it. This plus the fact that they're already anti-gay to the core means nothing will change.

It isn't the First World why the Catholic Church policy matters. We have homosexual acts legal. I think reddit seems to forget this."

lynn,ADHD,1389592247.0,"I'm going to lose a pound. I want to see 182.5 or less on the scale by Saturday. This is part of my self-threat that if I don't lose 3 pounds by February 1, I have to start counting calories with MyFitnessPal. In fact, I'll add to that that if I don't lose a pound a week for 2 or 3 weeks in a row, I have to count calories.

My other goal for this week is on Friday I'm calling a cleaning service and so the clutter has to be taken care of by then. I'm a stay-at-home mom but I'm trying to start teaching my (sick) daughter to write and I have a month-old son so it'd be hard for a non-ADDed person...with ADD it's nightmare mode. But I've been trying forever and it has got to get done; I can't think or even breathe with all this crap lying around. It has to be my top priority since it makes everything harder. Once we have a cleaning service, I'll also call a handyman to take care of attaching the furniture to the wall, or maybe I'll be so unwilling to make the phone call that I'll actually do it myself (haha).

Also, the weekly to-do-list threads have been really helpful to me, so even though this isn't strictly that, can I also post my to-do list here? If not I'll make a new post. Until I hear otherwise I'll put it here.

[edit: well, it's 3 am or some similarly unholy hour and I'm in the ER with a 1-month-old baby who just tested positive for RSV. Chances are he'll be fine, but they want to admit him because he's so young. So push everything down a day, at least. I'll still try to get the tires done and go to the post office but there's nothing that absolutely can't be pushed back. Part of Getting Shit Done is knowing when not to push it.]

[Further edit: It's now Wednesday and we'll be in the hospital for at least another night. I'm just going to punt this whole list down to next week and call it even.]

Monday:

- 10 am: take car to the shop for tires (leave by 9:45 = start leaving by 9:15 = shower by 8:45 = up by 8:30 at the latest. Alarm is now set). That'll take an hour. Afterwards I'll pick up husband and we'll run our errands at the credit union.
- **Post office. Mail stuff.** THIS MUST BE DONE TODAY. FIL has been waiting on his sunglasses and BIL has been waiting on his hard drive. Husband is counting on me to get this done.
- Costco: canned air if they have it, a bench for the entry if they have one that works, muffins, bread, chicken, ground beef, broccoli and other veggies, bacon, milk, berries, maybe some stuff to add to salad.
- Clean. Doesn't matter what. Could start with:
    - put laundry away
    - empty and refill the dishwasher which is now clean
    - box by the glider that has Christmas crap in it
    - coffee table toys
    - daughter's room
    - leftovers in the fridge
    - find a better place for the play kitchen
    - stuff on/around fireplace
    - balcony
    - scrub toilets; attack black spots on tub with Comet
    - rearrange monitors on desk
- Eat a damn salad. You cut up the lettuce tonight; all you have to do is put it in a bowl and put dressing on it. You need green things in your diet. Eat it. Can also add: olives, fried onions, dried fruit, parmesan cheese, berries
- Empty cat box.
- Make something for dinner? Hash browns, eggs, bacon?
- 7 pm appointment with counselor

Tuesday:

- If daughter is no longer showing signs of illness, YMCA in the morning. Leave by 11 = start leaving by 10:30 = shower by 10 = up by 9:45 at the latest.
- Education store if she's still sick. Get beads for lacing? Also, might visit Toys R Us and get her the My Little Pony set with the main characters; also see if they have preschooler-sized belts.
- Tumbling class at 3:30 pm if she's no longer sick. 
- Eat salad
- Clean.
- Make dinner (maybe hash browns, eggs, bacon)

Wednesday:

- YMCA if she's not sick; something else if she is, just to get out of the house so I'll be more likely to be ready to clean when we get back.
- Clean
- Any salad left?
- Make dinner

Thursday:

- YMCA if she's not sick.
- Playdate sometime after 10 am but before, say, 2 pm. Leave by 5 pm at the latest.
- Knit night! Be ready to leave by 5:45 in case Husband is home that early.

Friday:

- YMCA if she's not sick; something else if she is
- Clean
- Make dinner"

OWS failed because it was a bunch of political outsiders with no connections to the halls of power.  A lot of [civil rights progressives within the Democratic party tried to reach out to OWS](http://thegrio.com/2011/10/10/civil-rights-legend-john-lewis-snubbed-by-occupiers/), but OWS did a much better job of preventing themselves from being ""co-opted"" than the Tea Party did.

sporkmonger,rails,1389592658.0,"Look, Node.js is worth learning. It's an interesting framework, but it's also a fad, much as Rails was when it first started. Rails had staying power in the long term, which no doubt disappointed many people who rightly pointed out that it was being used because it was fashionable. And Node will have staying power too because it is a good tool, but I don't think it's destined to be quite as useful as Rails has ultimately proven to be, simply because it's useful for a narrower set of problem domains. There's a set of problems that Node is pretty good at solving, but as with most fad languages/frameworks, you find people pounding in screws with a hammer because, ""Damnit, I just learned how to use a hammer and nobody can tell me that maybe a hammer isn't the right tool for this job!""

The nice thing about Rails these days is that it's no longer fashionable. So the people who are using it these days are more often using it because it actually was the right tool for the job.

I know my way around Node and I like it for some applications (sometimes even more than Rails), but when I interview somewhere and they say ""We're strictly a Node.js shop"" my first instinct is usually to politely decline any offers that get extended. Node simply isn't a tool you can use to the exclusion of all else, and there are way, way too many people doing that right now. Maybe that's too close-minded of me, but so far I have no regrets.

Node is a reasonable choice when being religious about non-blocking I/O is a core concern for the problem you're trying to solve. The callback idioms of JavaScript/CoffeeScript are a natural fit for asynchronous I/O operations and being able to use the same language on both server side and client side makes programmer mental context switches a lot less of a problem. (I never found them to be a big issue myself though.)

That said, more complex callback chains, especially after you're more than one or two levels deep, can get really hairy to understand and debug. Good luck reading other people's deeply nested code when you're brand new to the platform. Frankly, spaghetti GOTO code can sometimes be easier to decipher. Good async control flow libraries help a lot, but not enough people use them. There's also some scalability problems that can lurk in the limitation that Node is single-threaded (w/ event loops via libuv) and it almost always requires each app server to load balance across Node processes in order to fully utilize your server's multiple cores. Realistically though, the same is true of Rails in almost all real-world cases, so for most Rails vs. Node evaluations, that's a red herring. However, there are other platforms that don't run into this problem as much, so it's usually still worth bringing up. The other issue is that developers have to be cognizant that node will happily let you 'spend' more computing resources than you actually have. In other words, it's really easy to schedule a whole shed-load of tasks in Node, and then the event loop comes around and tries to actually perform that work but gets hopelessly backlogged. Meanwhile, each new piece of computational work scheduled requires more memory. And in particular, if you start swapping to disk, the slowness just cascades wildly out of control from there. You get the picture. It's not ideal and not particularly easy to solve in many cases. The worst thing is that your typical node server has fairly unsophisticated controls for limiting incoming network sources of work (read: connections)."

AnimusHerb240,DigitalCartel,1389592722.0,"If there is this concept of salvation, there must be a concept of unsalvation first, aye? I don't know what the best word for that is, maybe damnation? Maybe I'm using that word wrong. But that's the word I'll use. So the idea is we're damned until we're saved. Saved through salvation. Which is the saving. The redemption in the face of feeling like one needs to be redeemed. Feeling like one is damned.

**""I need to be redeemed.""** -- does that sentence feel like a ""true fact?"" Like, are you convinced that that is something true about you? About the human race? You feel like you need salvation as a remedy for this state/condition that you are in? (I ask in this curious, inquisitive tone even though I am personally familiar with the experience of such a thing, bear with me).

""I need to be redeemed"" cannot be a true statement. Or if it is true, it is not any more true than ""I do not need to be redeemed."" Errr maybe that negative form ""I do not need to be redeemed"" is not best....let's change that to a positive statement: ""I am redeemed.""

So there is this ""fact"" floating around ""I need to be redeemed"" and there is another fact floating around ""I am already redeemed."" We'll give that second one an official label, capitalized, and in bold: **The Truth of My Redemption.**

Two sides of the same coin. In occult studies, the answer to every yes or no question about reality is ""Yes and No,"" it is important to explore/understand why the answer is ""Yes"" and why the answer is ""No""

""Do I need to be redeemed?"" Yes and no. 

If we were already pretty familiar with feeling like we need to be redeemed (such is life!), now **The Truth of My Redemption** is chilling in the room with us, too, like an awkward piece of furniture. How do we explore it? Poke it with a stick? How do we converse with it? Interact with it? Learn from it? Get some useful information? Commune with it?

In occult studies, it is common to introduce, as a mental exercise, a certain element of personal relate-ability to thoughtforms by upgrading them into personifications of those thoughtforms. You can't commune with an idea, but you can commune with an entity.

&gt; We may personalise natural forces in terms of human consciousness; or we may abstract human consciousness in terms of natural forces; both are legitimate proceedings in occult metaphysics, and the process yields some very interesting clues and some very important practical applications.

&gt; —Dion Fortune

So take **The Truth of My Redemption** and, as a mental exercise, morph it into a person...that is, give it a name and a face. What name would you give to someone who personifies the truth of your redemption? I'll leave it to you, it's none of my business. I chose the name Greg. It just seemed like a kinda ""redeemy"" name.

So now instead of a lump of dead words chilling on the hardwood floor, we have a nice friendly smiling guy chilling there with whom we can have a conversation. Why nice and friendly and smiling? I donno, I guess in my mind's eye someone who represents my redemption in the face of damnation is nice and friendly and smiling. Don't judge me, it's **my** imagination. In your interview, your salvation guy can be frowny and douchey if you want.

mental exercise BEGIN!!!!!!!!!

""Who are you?""

""Um...I'm Greg. You brought me here, remember? So...""

""Do I need to be redeemed?""

""That's an odd question to ask someone who is *literally* living proof of your own redemption. Hi. I'm Greg. i.e. 'you're redeemed'. Do you have any better questions? I'm all ears.""

""Uhhhh why do I feel so shitty all the time?""

""Do you really feel shitty ALL the time?""

""Yeah. Pretty much.""

""...Dooooo you feel really shitty right now in this very moment?""

""HHhrrmmmm uhhhhhh I guess not, more like...curious...inquisitive. This is an interview, afterall. And you seem like a friendly guy. Hard to feel so shitty in the presence of such a friendly guy. I guess I don't really feel shitty right now in this second.""

""So you don't feel shitty ALL the time.""

""No.""

""So do you have any better questions?""

""Are you me?""

""Huh?""

""Are you me? Or...Am I you?""

""No. I am me, and you are you. I'm Greg. You are not Greg.""

""But you came from my imagination, you know? So you kinda ARE me.""

""Did I really come from your imagination like you 'invented me'? Orrrrr was I kinda already here all along? You're certainly not the first person to personify redemption as a mental exercise. The idea wasn't even yours in the first place, someone told you to do it! And the idea wasn't theirs in the first place, either.""

""Are you real?""

""I'll answer your question with a question: Is this conversation real?""

""This is an awkward interview. My questions aren't turning out the answers I thought they might. I just have this nameless itch I am trying to figure out how to scratch, and I can't think of the right words to ask you.""

""I'm living proof that the itch is already scratched, man. It's really nice to meet you, by the way. Do you have Facebook?""

""Yeaahhh....I just--""

""That's cool, uh, you don't have to add me or anything, I just....nevermind. You seem cool, is all. If you ever wanna hang out again, I'll be chillin' here, I guess.""

--------------------

...etc etc etc, I'm just riffing here but you get the idea. Mental exercise. Imaginary conversations. I have imaginary conversations with my demons, imaginary conversations a myriad of other deified concepts, with dead celebrities, with dead relatives. With living relatives. With living friends. I mean, when I'm in the shower, or driving around, I'm always having imaginary conversations with my friends. Maybe that's just me.

**The Digital Cartel** is NOT salvation. It is not the truth of salvation. **""The Truth of Salvation""** is the truth of salvation, and nothing else ever, ever ever ever will be the truth of salvation. Not The Digital Cartel, not drugs, not better communication, not love, not interfaith relations, not democracy, not anarchy, not me, not you, not the bible, no sutras or vedas or upanishads, not poetry, or ""art"", or altruism, or philanthropy, or capitalism, or communism.

**Q:** Yeah, but...***WHAT*** is the truth of salvation?

**A:** The truth of salvation is **The Truth of Salvation**

**Q:** Yeah, but...***WHAT*** is salvation?

**A:** Salvation is salvation. There it is, right there! Don't need to look for it. It's the first word in this paragraph. No need to look further. Boom. Found it. Salvation is salvation. Salvation equals salvation. A = A. 5 = 5.

--------------------

Logically, it makes just as much sense to feel that one is redeemed as it does for one to feel that one is in need of redemption.

However, there's a difference between logically understanding something and really really truly feeling that something is true.

Is it possible to really feel the truth of the matter of one's own redemption? To ""know for a fact"" that I am redeemed and am really in no need of such a thing? I think so. Because the feeling of needing redeemed is a new feeling...I don't remember having it when I was younger. So I musta used to feel it subconsciously on some level, until ""all this stuff happened to me"" and now I feel shittily ""in need of"" salvation.

I am also fond of a tangential concept I learned in Buddhism called ""Basic Goodness"". The assertion/position/suggestion is that every last bit of every experience at the very least is basically good. This is kinda at odds with the concept of ultimate emptiness that might be encountered through other veins of thinking/philosophy. I mean, it seems logical in a way that when it all comes down to it, existence is a very neutral thing that is neither good nor bad. But the idea of Basic Goodness is that the mere fact that you are here experiencing life, breathing, is basically good news and not at all bad, despite whatever suffering you may be choosing to focus on in any given moment. All of existence just inherently has this good quality to it, no matter what form it takes. Establishing further familiarity with this takes time, and I have found that it is not a matter of ""faith"" as I previously believed it to be...it's just a concept that deserves some exploring, so I would maybe Google that...not sure off the top of my head what relevant texts to recommend. Chogyam Trungpa is a baller, though. Anything written by him. Buddhism is pretty cool. Introduced me to a particular form of meditation called [samatha]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samatha) I recommend highly. The kind of answers that really satisfy will only come in silence, not in a bunch of talky-talk-word-mouth-noises, amiright? AMIRIGHT?

I also barely know what I'm talking about. So...you know...grain of salt, and all that rot"

Geroy21,changemyview,1389592744.0,"I like you. I work for a municipal government and you're spot on. It's really unfortunate that in a sense we are competing with towns that are 40 minutes down the road, when the corporation setting up there benefits our residents as well (those who get jobs there). 

The strength of municipality over other governments is that it can better handle those issues that are based locally, the downside is that we have to remain very focused on a small area because that's where we get all our funding from. 

Don't get me wrong, corporations moving to the area is always a good thing. Benefit the part, benefit the whole, right? But it's still our duty to do what we can to make sure we get the most benefits. 

So how are incentives justified? Simple. If we take a bit of a hit on the tax revenue or whatever, as long as the net whole increases we can use those extra funds for a wide range of things. Right now in my community we're putting together an after school program for underprivileged youth. Which is expected to cost 200k a year. For a municipality that's 2500 people that's a lot of money. Now imagine if we got tax dollars from a new mill? That would suddenly be no problem. 

And why is the after school program a big deal? Aside from giving these kids some much needed mentoring, the stats show that things like teen pregnancy rates drop way down, to the point of being non existent. It's pretty cool. The unfortunate reality is that programs like this aren't possible without the tax revenue gained from the major corporations in your town.

The other thing about MMA that the NFL has lost is the raw, pure, interactions with fans.  When the NFL was punishing players for tweeting before games, the UFC was putting fighters' twitter names on the Tale of the Tape.  MMA organizations encourage fans to get close and be involved.

Of course, if you're doing billing systems, you should be familiar with PCI-DSS anyways, but that doesn't mean you want to be putting yourself in a scenario where maintaining full PCI-DSS compliance is required of you. Technically, non-compliance may incur fines and breaches can get really expensive, depending on how much cardholder data is lost.

codayus,feedthebeast,1389592830.0,"&gt; Don't you need IC2 to make MPS armor? I know you do in DW20 1.6

Not at all.  MPS is actually part of the UE system, and it ships with configs to work with Vanilla, UE, IC2, GT, and TE.  You can actually craft everything using no other mods at all, but most packs will disable all but one recipe set; DW20 probably has the IC2 recipes enabled, but I usually use the TE set (which at least some packs have on by default).

Full recipe list [here](http://machinemuse.net/recipes.php) on the official site, although it might be outdated; dunno.

&gt; Can you fly with other mods? The mods you listed don't add that. More of a question then a disagreement.

MPS is the big one, but flight is also possible via DartCraft (which is part of the BC/MJ ecosystem, even if a very odd part of it).  There's also TC, Morph, Advanced Genetics, and (kinda sorta) the hangglider from OpenBlocks.  Oh, and RotaryCraft has a jetpack too, which I think is a direct replacement for IC2.  Not 100% sure as I've yet to really get into RotaryCraft.  Oh, also Witchery.

&gt; MPS armor being OP

It kind of is, honestly.  And especially with the current incarnation of IC2, its IC2 recipes seem really cheap.  Nanoarmour is *SO* much more expensive.

I'm actually currently using TechWorld 2, which doesn't have MPS, and finding it very interesting.  Nice to challenge yourself occasionally.

My next challenge is probably to look at RotaryCraft properly.  It has (in the form of bedrock armour) some very powerful unbreakable flying armour) which is a good start, and it looks like a balanced (ie, very expensive) path to obtain it.  We'll see.  :)"

dakru,AskMen,1389592837.0,"&gt; I think you're putting a bit too much into lifting weights. Sometimes people learn things but can't figure out how to transfer the applicable skills to other areas of their life.

It's certainly not something that everyone has to do or else they're ""not really living life"" or something like that, but the benefits go quite a bit beyond just looks, in my opinion.

&gt; Also I don't quite get how it builds confidence...?

The most obvious thing is being able to feel better about your body, but I think there's more to it than that. I think a large part of what makes up someone's confidence is knowing that they can put effort into something and succeed. Lifting weights allows you to set goals and watch your effort pay off as you add one 2.5lb plate to each side of the bar each workout and slowly approach that milestone that you've been eyeing since you started going to the gym."

maowsers93,Anxiety,1389592958.0,"I am 29 and was diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder when I was about 19. I took meds for a hot second which made me feel better but I couldn't afford them so I stopped. I've had a shortage of health insurance for the better part of my life which has caused me to self  medicate through herbal remedies. I can tell you with the utmost confidence that herbal remedies do not hold a candle to what medication can do.

Things like Melatonin and L-Theanine helps to take the edge off for sure but nothing really fixes it in my experience other than actual medication. Of course someone with severe anxiety who has a family history of debilitating mental illness is telling you this so if your anxiety is milder then it might do the trick for you. 

I personally have been able to over come my anxiety and move forward with my life but every time I'm able to tackle my anxiety in one manner it transforms into a new one. Recently I've begun having breathing problems and after seeing multiple doctors who can't figure out why its become clear to me that it is probably just my anxiety. 

If you think you can move forward with the herbal route then by all means but if you think that it isn't giving you the treatment you really need then I'd advise you to walk, not run, to the nearest Psychiatrist.

Not to say that there weren't good tracks off of his album (See, As I Em, His Dream, The Perfectionist, La Di Da) but Pabst and Jazz, GEV2 and SFG are tops compared to what he's freshman stuff was.  Then there's the Rawth EP that he did with Nottz, which is in my opinion his #2 work out right now.

I'd rank his shit 

 * Pabst and Jazz
 * Rawth EP
 * SFG
 * GEV 1
 * GEV 2
 * AITB

And If you really want me to get technical you can throw ""Just Listen"" and ""Believe the Hype"" as the last two.  You can find ""Just Listen"" but BTH seems to be gone forever.

Bones STF are excellent for concrete park riding and street, but they are a bit slippery on wood or masonite ramps.

InfinitelyThirsting,Frugal,1389593306.0,"Oh god, never grow food in free dirt from craigslist. That shit usually comes from excavating construction sites, and is meant to be used as fill dirt. That stuff isn't proper soil, and even if it isn't contaminated, you're still going to have to amend the hell out of it to get it to something plants will do well in. Especially in containers, because you *cannot* use normal dirt, or even gardening soil, in containers--you have to use potting soil, which has other things blended in to keep it from compacting and losing drainage. If you just steal some dirt and put it in pots, your plants will drown when the water can no longer drain through it, or be overrun with fungus because of the lack of aeration, etc. Potting soil doesn't actually contain any dirt at all, just mixes of compost, perlite, peat moss, etc. Your ignorant question about who tests soil anyway just shows how very ignorant you are to the actual process. Different plants need different soil makeups.

Growing tomatoes is a funny one to pick, too, because tomatoes in particular need special nutrition to be fruitful, if it's anything other than a cherry tomato. You have to get the balance right, because if you have too much nitrogen, you end up with nothing but big leafy vines, and it won't produce much if any fruit; same goes for anything that isn't a leafy green, for the record. Plus, for tomatoes you also need stakes or cages to keep them upright, or they'll topple over from their own weight, and you either need plant tape to tie them, or you'll have to redo the string all the time to keep it from strangling the vines as they grow.

You can grow lots of food in little space, yes, but that takes a hell of a lot more money, time, supplies, and effort than just picking up free fill dirt from craigslist. Looking at that guy's set up, that's easily thousands of dollars, just in creating all those beds and filling them with soil (which is especially not free when you're going organic like them)--you have to be sure to get untreated wood, too, or else the chemicals used to make it resistant to fungus and insects will leach into the soil and be absorbed into your food. He has large metal frames, too, and all those clay pot irrigators, etc.

Plus, if you watch it, it takes him and his entire family working all day long, every day, to maintain it. And they live in southern California, which has an ideal climate for year-round gardening. A lot of people don't have that.

And, if someone doesn't have a yard, where are they going to put these thirty five-gallon buckets? And where will the light come from? No yard, no sun. Grow lights cost a *lot* of money.

dakru,AskMen,1389593310.0,"One option for lifting is to train your whole body each time you're in the gym. Another option is to divide the body into different workouts to do on different days--that's called a split. Usually the number before the word ""split"" refers to how many workouts you split the body into. If you divide your body into two parts and work your lower body this workout, upper body next workout, lower body again the workout after that, etc., then you're doing a 2 day split (which might have you in the gym overall 3 or 4 days a week).

However since it's not really practical to divide your body into 6 different parts to work them separately, I'm assuming that what /u/Reatki means by a 6 day split is that he's in the gym 6 days a week."

I get that its 'the right thing to do' and 'he has a right to know' but really all you will do is destroy his marriage, and destroy the family unit. He already has kids with her, so he will end up: having a shitty divorce, owing child support, living in a shitty apartment and hating his life, at least temporarily.  

I doubt you will get the 'thanks man, I needed the truth' type of reaction at any point in the future.  Sure you could ruin his life, his finances, and his self confidence, or you could just try to occupy your time with something other than your own guilt for not saying anything.  Just let it go, and stay out of it.

""But there is a girl in hetero porn"" you say, and that's what stright guys are focusing on. Well who do you want having sex with her? Should they be fit? Would it be the same if you were watching her have sex with a guy you find replusive? Would they have a large penis, that part matters right? but it's not gay right?

It's like that, only slightly switched around.

OriginalAndWittyName,IAmA,1389593669.0,"Your comment got me thinking about how you are both correct in a larger sense and yet incorrect in your direct context.  
You can in fact fly without going through T'SA searches . Airlines operate under federal  rules of part 121 which controls them. Charter planes fly under a different sent of regulation under FAR's 135 so you don't have to undergo the TSA searching of you and your stuff every time you go to the airport. You could also fly yourself under part 91 as also private pilot and avoid the TSA searches. 

So now the searches are not necessarily stopping your flying.  But! 

You are correct that we have to obey an organization but it is in fact the FAA. Flying is not a right but a privilege in our country (in fact on pilot certificate ' s the wording says (this individual has been found qualified to exercise the privileges of a commercial/private pilot). 

An example is kinda like martial law. The government needs to impose martial law to take your rights away, but on 9/11 the FAA could simply ground all aircraft without having to invoke martial law as it is not a right.

If you have any questions feel free to ask away. I'm an instructor at an aviation university and your comments actually got me thinking.

Noneerror,AskReddit,1389593978.0,"Mortgage documents have little to do with the title of the house as I said above. Having them or not having them has little to do with *how* they are taking ownership as well. They are taking ownership via adverse possession. The important part is the bank is paying the property taxes and upkeep etc.

At some point the bank will say to a judge, ""The estate of grandma hasn't been cleared (netted and dispersed) and we, The Bank of Wolf, have a claim on the assets of the estate (the mortgage). We at Bank of Wolf want the court to declare our claim valid and give us full ownership of the house since nobody else has filed a claim and nobody else is distributing assets of the estate. We have been paying the fees on this property."" A notice will go into the local newspaper announcing this and asking claimants to come forward (which nobody ever sees) and then judge declares the Bank of Wolf owner of Grandmas house and then that's it. Tough luck to everyone else who thinks they have a right to that house. edit-Plus since Grandma died intestate the bank could have gotten the probate court to declare the bank as equivalent of the executor of the estate. In which case they give the estate to themselves and let everyone else make claims on the estate to them which the bank gets to approve or decline.

In your case when multiple people own title to something and one dies then generally the dead person's name gets crossed off and then that's it. I don't know in your situation due to details. I think you'd have to talk with an estate (ie inheritance not real estate) lawyer.

It depends all on the details. Details like: Was it a secured loan? Who was the executor of the estate? (If it was your FiL then that is bad.) Did the executor of the estate do their job properly? If not, the executor is liable. How much money is involved? If it's $2 million then the bank will fight for it. If it is $20,000 then the bank will just write it off as not worth fighting over.

My best guess is that your father in law should ask for all the supporting documents from the bank on this mortgage. Regardless of what the documents say, inform the bank he doesn't owe them anything while putting anything he might owe (like the loan payments) into a trust. *Then see what the bank does.*

You know the saying ownership is 9/10ths of the law? Well your FiL has ownership and the bank needs to convince the law that he owes them something. Plus the bank has to want to put in the effort in time and money to do that convincing."

lynn,ADHD,1389594026.0,"- Diaper bag stays open so I see whether it has enough diapers and if the wipes are in there. I know I have three things in addition to the diaper bag that must come with me: phone, keys, wallet (which should be in the bag, but I check every time because once in a while I take it out while at home).

- When I do something without writing down what I need to remember, I note the number of things I need to get or do. For example, I need milk, butter, and eggs at the grocery store and I'm just running in on my way home; instead of muttering ""milk butter eggs milk butter eggs milk butter eggs"" while trying to wrangle a baby and a 3-year-old, I remember that I need three things, and if I can only think of two, I stand there until I remember the third thing. It rarely fails.

- Before I take something off the burner or out of the oven, I turn off the heat.

- I'm constantly double checking myself. Did I lock the door? I don't remember doing so -- go check. Did I turn off the oven when I took the cookies out? Don't remember -- go check. Do I have my: phone, wallet, keys? Diaper bag? Where are my children (the fact that I have to ask myself this terrifies me)? What am I doing today? Did I lock the car? Better make it beep again just to be sure. When was the last time I: fed the baby, got the mail, did laundry, cleaned the cat box, had sex with my husband (I have a low libido so I track frequency so that we have a normal sex life)? Am I forgetting anything else?

- When I leave the apartment I pick up my keys as the last thing, because I must keep them in my hand until the door is locked. After I lock the door I put them in my pocket or an outside pocket of the diaper bag, or I hold them until I get to the car. I never lock the car if my keys are not in my hand, though I will put them down inside the car while I'm strapping the kids in, but only in certain places where I can see them the whole time. Nothing gets put on top of the keys.

    When I get out of the car, I keep the keys in my hand or in that particular spot inside the car while I'm taking the kids out. Once the kids are out, I grab the keys to lock the car (though having a second child has disrupted my routine enough that I've forgotten to lock the car once or twice; I'm fixing that by double checking to the point where an onlooker might think I have OCD), and then put them in my pocket if I have a jacket/hoodie or in the pocket of the diaper bag. When we go back to the car, same routine.

    When I get out of the car at home, same deal, except I usually keep the keys in my hand unless I don't have a free hand, which is often. I usually have the stroller with me, and it has something that you'd think would be a cupholder but is a rectangular shape, so I put my keys in there. I have to take them out to get into the apartment, so I have them in my hand when we go in, and they do not leave my hand until I set them on the mantle in their spot.

- When I do something right, I take a moment to feel good about it. There's a whole big thing about operant conditioning, but let it suffice to say that patting yourself on the back when you take even the tiniest step toward change can be an extremely effective method for changing behavior. There's more to it than that, of course, but that's the basic principle."

Langlie,Showerthoughts,1389594103.0,"Not who you were replying to, but I'll throw in my two cents. I'm going to use a lot of generalizations, so forgive me.

I think most straight men are aroused by the visual of women's bodies (and gay men by men's bodies). Of course the act itself is a factor in enjoyment, but predominantly the focus is on *looking* at the body of a woman (or man).

For most women, arousal is from enjoyment of the act itself. This enjoyment can come from visual of the porn itself, the audio (lottts of women enjoy sound over sight), or even reading about the act through literotica. The reason for this boils down to empathetic arousal. I believe women sexually enjoy other people's sexual enjoyment.

I'm a straight woman, but I watch all kinds of porn. Straight, male-male, female-female, threesomes, orgies -- it's all good. I like seeing people enjoying themselves. I don't care thy much about how any of them look.

If you go over to /r/chickflixxx (a subreddit for women's porn choices) you'll see that one of the most common elements on all the popular videos is that the actors seem to be genuinely enjoying themselves."

Seeing that BAC really hurt me because I had gotten married and moved. I used to live 20 minutes from my dad, but I moved away. I know he was lonely. I know he was sad about he and my mom splitting up. I looked through our text messages and saw that the last text he sent me, I didn't text back. WHY DIDN'T I TEXT BACK? I hope he didn't get drunk that night because of his loneliness.

I have a lot of self-blame too, but I'm starting to realize that my dad was a grown man capable of making his own decisions. I'm starting to let go of the guilt...

Your dad seemed like he was an awesome guy and a good father. Conquering a drinking problem for the sake of your little girl is really an accomplishment, and takes a strong person. My dad was a great guy too, always making everyone laugh, always making things fun. Not a lot of people get to have a good relationship with their dads in childhood, but we did.

Square has been growing really fast and there's a ton of local merchants using them who have no in-house talent at all. Anybody who needs to integrate Square with an accounting system or decent analytics is likely going to need to contract that out. This could be a good place to get your feet wet, but be aware that local merchants can't afford the higher rates you'll be charging once you know what you're doing. But they could still be a good way to get started early on when finding clients is still hard. My first few good clients were local businesses.

Meanwhile Bitcoin's hype-train has been steaming along at a pretty good clip too. There are merchants who implement Bitcoin simply because it's almost a guaranteed mention in the press these days and because Bitcoin's supporters will happily spend their cryptocurrency anywhere it's accepted simply because it's being accepted.

&gt;historically speaking, a woman getting pleasure out of sex was a really novel and scary idea.

Unless it's affected your life I don't want to hear about it. I couldn't give a shit about history unless you can show it's relevant. From my perspective we're talking about the last 20 years of socialisation, passing on of attitudes max. Historically speaking was what? 40 years ago? 30 perhaps? That's before my time. So I guess a relevant point would have been to ask when they grew up as that affects the answer considerably and people tend to assume reddit is full of people in their late teens to late 20s, early 30s.

&gt; More over, if your development is so dependent on TFS, what would you do if Microsoft decided to discontinue it? Isn't that risk reason enough to want to use free development tools?

Guess that happens shortly after Microsoft decides to discontinue Windows? And even if that happens people will migrate to other systems. We did that two companies ago, from Perforce and some web ticket system to TFS. Worked pretty well.

Travellerknight,changemyview,1389594590.0,"Many good points.
Ultimately I don't know what the theoretical integrated union would look like, and I am not egotistical enough to believe that I can solve problems that have been around for centuries, that would be something for politicians to debate.

I feel that the EU's bureaucratic problems all stem from the fact that the EU evolved naturally, as such the EU parliament doesn't know what the limits of its powers are and so becomes the bureaucratic nightmare seen in your article, with standardizing toilets etc and read about in the Daily Mail.

Many good points here, arguing against the EU, let me counter some of them, if you please.

It could be argued that without the Euro that the debt crisis wouldn't be as bad for the countries in question. From an Individuals point of view the euro is a massive benefit for people travelling to other countries within the Euro zone (better consumerism) and is better at facilitating trade between member countries without fluctuating currencies changing the price of goods.

We've agreed the insanity of the rapid euro growth

Varieties between countries is becoming increasingly decreased with the growth of globelisation, leading to similar policies being introduced around the world ie Gay Marriage is increasingly being adopted by country after country in short order.

Ill agree to less bureaucracy but it could be argued that there would have to be an increase if there were more ""independent"" countries as we would have to negotiate with them all individually as opposed to as a bloc

Again agreed, but most of our trading partners are the EU or allies of the EU, and increasingly with the growth of globelisation, all countries are now interdepantant. It could be argued that being together in a more solid union would allow is greater trading powers.
To use Norway as an example, Norway is nominally Independent within the EU, but when we compare it to the UK, Norway has no negotiating leverage when they deal with the EU. In fact they have less sovereignty than member states who decide the policy. The UK is more able to control their own destiny - in areas from international trade, to environmental protection, to consumer rights - because they are part of a 27 nation, democratic bloc. Real sovereignty, rather than theoretical sovereignty, is enhanced by EU membership."" [1](http://www.debatepolitics.com/europe/56362-good-things-eu.html)

I will agree that there is theoretically more democracy for the individual countries, but there is also the ability to be more draconian towards minorities within your own country, the EU has done more to protect minority languages than the individual countries ever have, especially in Spain (Catalan), UK (welsh/Cornish) and France (Basque) then the individual governments.

Conversely no outside investment from countries which it won't benefit, arguably...

EU agricultural policies I will admit are completely insane but thats more a lobbying problem than something inherent in the system, it could be reformed into something far more productive, with the political will.

I ultimately feel that in an increasingly interconnected globalised world, no country will be able to thrive on its own, it will get swallowed up by bigger countries or protective bloc's reducing its ability to do anything, see the Norway example above.
Therefore a greater integration would allow greater growth and stronger Countries within its union

komnenos,AskMen,1389594856.0,"Throughout high school and my first year of college women just didn't notice me in ""that way.""  I had many platonic female friends but none that were anymore then that.  Sophomore year of college that all changed.  My roommate Liu (Chinese obviously) noticed that I never was going out with girls and being a ladies man himself told me that he would help me.  After hitting up a restaurants and going to a few get togethers I found out to my surprise that many Chinese girls found me physically attractive!  I can count on one hand the number of times that American/Canadian girls have called me attractive but to be honest I've lost count of the Chinese girls who have.  Its an unbelievable how good it feels to be desired and not have to put myself out there.  Without as much as saying a word girls would tell me that I'm ""really cute"" or that I had ""beautiful blue eyes"".

Besides that there are several other things.  In general the Asian girls that I have gone out with have been very smart, not to be mean but I often just can't see this in other ethnicities.  Very few people care about history and when I'm able to go on about historical subjects for hours and watch them get excited it just makes me feel good about myself.  For example over the summer I went out with a nice Korean girl.  She asked me how much I knew about Korean history and as I went into 15 minutes of Korean history I watched her face get ecstatic.  When I finished she excitedly told me that I knew more about Korean history then any white guy (and most Koreans).  I've just never had those sort of experiences with non Asian girls.  

I'm going out with an extraordinary woman right now.  She's fluent in four languages (well five if we include her native dialect which doesn't sound like Mandarin at all!) and she and I can talk about politics and history for up to seven hours at a time.  Thats something you just can't find all to often regardless of race!  

edit: And honestly in my experience I've found many Asian women to be strong minded and I love that.  Hell it started when I was young, I'll never forget my childhood sweetheart, we were in elementary school and she barely spoke any english but when she saw a guy pick a fight with me she was the only one who stepped in (and nearly strangled the kid).

EnergyCritic,AskFeminists,1389594917.0,"[The BJS report](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ipv.pdf)

Washington Post's analysis exaggerates the discrepancy of Jacquelyn Campbell's statistic and the original report. Clearly, the fact that the rate dropped does not mean her report was any less accurate.

Besides, the article places an undue responsibility on Jacquelyn Campbell for the way her findings were used. Certainly, something should be said about Eric Holder and the American Journal of Public Health. 

Also, not sure how this is an example of ""feminists thinking the ends justify the means"" when it's not feminists here who are accused of taking things out of context. Eric Holder is not a declared feminist nor involved with the movement and neither is the American Journal of Public Health.

mundabit,birthcontrol,1389594961.0,"Generess FE as a drug is just as effective as  Natazia. however reason you find more stories about Generess FE failing is because it is a chewable tablet, and therefore there is more that can inhibit the drug from being absorbed, It actually makes it harder to take the pill correctly, if bits get stuck in your teeth, or spat up, you miss out on some of the dosage.

The reason many people experience extreme side effects on Generess is because it has a very high progesterone content compared to oestrogen, so it puts the body in a constant state of PMS. The progesterone in Natazia is diffrent from generess, so it's hard to predict if you will experiance these side effects. Evening primrose oil can be very good for hair loss, acne, and breast tenderness. Women's vitamin B complex (with added B12) can be very good for iritability or mood swings. As birth control is not a metabolic inhibitor, weight gain *is* avoidable by keeping a food diary and tracking your weight and your diet, Birth control can change your appetite to make you feel hungrier, and this is why you sometimes gain weight. If you are gaining weight despite tracking and doing the right things, it could be a sign that your natural hormones have gone whacky because of the new pill."

The company he worked for tanked, so his retirement plan (mostly stock) vanished. My mom couldn't make the entire mortgage payment on her own. The house was worth ~$350k, and my parents only had around $100k left to pay off.

The bank wouldn't work with them at all, and did everything they could to foreclose on the house. My parents even had buyers for a short sale where the bank would have made the rest of the outstanding balance on the loan, and my parents would have had at least some money to find another place with. Instead the bank dragged their feet on approving the short sale, and sent them paperwork saying they would approve the short sale a month after the buyers were initially interested. At that point the buyers already bought a new house.

The bank ended up with all the money my parents had put into their mortgage over the last twenty some years, AND the house. I'll let you all judge fault."

My guess is if the baby-daddy knew she was married when they had their fling he will not want to take them in, as he is aware of her infidelity

My aunt was in a similar situation. She got with her current husband (my uncle) while she was pregnant with another man's child. She and my uncle then had two other kids. And let me tell you, those two aren't as close to their father as he is with his illegitimate son. This all happened before I was born but it has become very well known amongst the fam-bam. Every one knows except my uncle and his bastard son

My point is good things can still come out of this. My aunt found religion and has stayed faithful to my uncle. Had someone told on her she could have very easily ended up a single mother.

I used to be so angry. All the time. I was so scared that one day I was going to lose it and go off on someone. I spent all my time just fighting to keep the anger in, but knowing it was ultimately a losing battle. And then, after years of this, it just.. went away. I never imagined that it would go away. But it did. Because a big part of it was the crazy insane teenage hormones and no one told me, ""Hey, working on self-control is great, but some of this will get better on its own. It's okay."" Now I still have a hell of a temper (that I've spent years getting under control), but it's no longer constantly roiling just below the surface no matter what else is going on.

Tomorrow and next week and next month won't be any easier. But take comfort in the fact that the rest of your life almost certainly will be.

Also, [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy). It works, bitches. And you can do it by yourself without a therapist if you really have to. Helps with everything from irrational fears to self-hatred to anxiety.

Meditation is also good and blah blah blah, but given how much I struggle with it myself I can hardly tell someone else ""just meditate for 15 minutes a day and everything will be better."" I mean maybe that's true but I can barely do 5 minutes.

Also, dunno what gods you work with if any, but Freyr is all about the feels. My almost-brother is a Freyrsman and sometimes when he's getting overwhelmed he'll call on Freyr and that seems to help him a lot."

classynerd,WTF,1389595463.0,"Fused spine here. I had the surgery at 11 because I went from a 20 degree curvature to 55 degrees in a little under a year and it was starting to severely impact my quality of life. They fused from the bottom of my neck to almost the very last lumbar vertebrae to make sure they wouldn't have to go back in again for another fusion, so I (thankfully) still have neck and hip movement. I sat up the first day after surgery and pretty much had to re-learn how to walk the second day, which was absolute agony. The pain was like someone threw a ton weight on my shoulders and then asked me to walk around with it. It's a pretty invasive surgery, which is why I understand why some people would want to avoid it if they can, but I am glad I had it done. My asthma disappeared almost completely because my spine wasn't attempting to crush my lungs anymore and my posture couldn't possibly be better (the way they adjusted the lateral curve of my spine actually gives me a little bit of a booty pop, so that's cool too). I miss being able to bend sometimes and the couple small spots on my body that are numb from nerves that were cut during the procedure (I did say it was invasive!) but it saved my life.

I just wish they had taken pictures of the procedure or video-taped my procedure like the OP. I thought all the medical science behind it was so cool as a kid, and still do."

That being said, I do adjust the colors, and I use a square ASCII tileset of my own creation. I've also been working on an ASCII-based graphics set that, for example, makes goblins and goats look different from each other.

Armagetiton,videos,1389596098.0,"Exactly. The biggest reason why Game of Thrones is the most torrented show ever is because of HBO themselves. They refuse to offer an alternative means to watch the show. I do not care for having cable and there is no way in hell I will pay literally 80 dollars a month (cable + HBO subscription) to watch ONE SHOW.

My response is torrenting the show now, pay for it when it's released on DVD. It's 2014, and if HBO doesn't want to adapt to the times and offer a reasonable service to those who only want to watch their show, then I'm going to pirate their shit and pay for it later.

I would personally pay up to 5 dollars per episode per one time view if it was offered legally over some on demand pay per view service. I think that's more than reasonable, hell, that's practically highway robbery on their part, but I would be willing to pay it if they'd just fucking offer it.

Lyn_Never,TwoXChromosomes,1389596480.0,"Spend a month actually documenting these incidents so that you actually look prepared if you go forward with a report.  Immediately after every interaction with her, write yourself an email at your work address, BCCing yourself at your personal email.  Use a Who What When Where format: who else was present, what the circumstances of the interaction were (meeting, informal conversation, etc), the time and date, the location, and as much as you can remember of what she said and how you responded.

Remember that ER is not there to protect you, they are there to protect the company.  So basically you need to take them a list of incidents, preferably with witnesses but at least emailed to yourself immediately afterward, so that when they look at them they will have to assess how much of a lawsuit risk her behavior is.

Also document any future meetings in which she is discussed outside her presence in lieu of talking about yourself and your work.  Because you shouldn't be having meetings about other people.

And while you can feel however you want about her, stop letting her do this to you in the name of ""empathy.""  This is the person who's going to get you fired, you need to take that seriously."

It's 2002 for AKP and 2003 for Erdoğan himself.

He did go to jail for reading a poem (not just ""attempting"" to do so), but it wasn't in the senate (because we don't have one, but it wasn't in the parliament either), and it wasn't in Kurdish (and what's with the quotation marks around the Kurdish poem?).

From [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromaeosauridae#Foot). They were both members of the Dromaeosauridae family, and both had the claw. Velociraptor was also part of the eudromaeosauria clade, mentioned in the above excerpt for having an ""especially blade-like"" second claw"
YouBWrong,sex,1389596869.0,"You say you're confused, but I think you understand completely what's going on in you.  A lot of couples with marriages like yours don't seem to know what they are getting into or equipped to deal with the eventual emotions of jealousy and envy, but I think you were.  Your previous adventures were shared adventures and now there is something she's not sharing.  It's a big line that she's crossed and I think you got that and I think you explained it to her.  So congratulations for that, it's no small feat.

Now it is really just a matter of two things happening:

1. You expand your definition of the relationship to allow her to have these individual experiences without you being part of it.  For some outsiders who are used to more conventional marriages that might seem like a small step.  It absolutely is not.  In fact it kind of turns things on their head and seems like a reduction of intimacy.  I don't know if I would want that in your place.

2. Your wife wakes up to the obvious and sees that this is not what you signed up for and requires a complete renegotiation of the terms of your relationship.  I think she's probably part way there already and looking to wind things down with her girl, or only bring her in to situations where you are also included.

Calling a band ""overrated"" (or, similarly, ""overplayed""), even if only within certain groups, is more of a comment on the fans than the band. It's not like the band did something wrong by becoming so popular. It doesn't make the music worse, it means people dislike the music because of negative associations."

TeHokioi,AskReddit,1389597026.0,"&gt;The distinctive claw, on the second digit of dromaeosaurids, has traditionally been depicted as a slashing weapon; its assumed use being to cut and disembowel prey.[30] In the ""Fighting Dinosaurs"" specimen, the Velociraptor lies underneath, with one of its sickle claws apparently embedded in the throat of its prey, while the beak of Protoceratops is clamped down upon the right forelimb of its attacker. This suggests Velociraptor may have used its sickle claw to pierce vital organs of the throat, such as the jugular vein, carotid artery, or trachea (windpipe), rather than slashing the abdomen.

csreid,AskReddit,1389597069.0,"aw, damn. I never look at that. I'll go back to how you were wrong, then.

No one sees all that data they keep from you. To think otherwise is pretty arrogant. The sheer amount of data that has to be processed for anyone that uses those analytics means that it's not feasible to look at what people are buying. Chances are, they barely even know your name - your name, as far as they're concerned, is your rewards card ID number. 

Further, ""data mining"" isn't something you do with a single data point, like an individual customer. It's about finding trends in the data. They aren't looking at what *you* bought, they're looking at what *everyone* bought.

Further still, they don't try to find any kind of underlying cause like whether or not you're sexually active or how many kids you have. They don't care. All they know is that people who buy prenatal vitamins are interested in buying diapers and baby clothes a few months later. That's an obvious connection for us, but most of the trends are probably a lot more cryptic and esoteric.

philhartmonic,chicago,1389597096.0,"How big is the apt?  

Assuming the utilities will add on another $50 to your housing expenses (for all intents and purposes, your rent) - that's pretty goddamn steep.

On principle, I don't see anything wrong with charging tenants with utilities, just as there's nothing wrong with tenants choosing buildings that provide utilities.  It's all just a question of the deal you're both willing to make.

A few things I think you should personally consider:
1) Belmont and Sheridan seems to have become a much more popular area recently - kind of an expansion of those absurdly expensive places in the seemingly northward expanding Gold Coast.  What have your previous rent increases been like?  How does the $/sq/ft compare with buildings around you?  Would keeping rents low instead of keeping up with property values in the past explain such a big jump in your rent?

2) If property values are rising - why do you think that is?  Whatever the cause happens to be, is getting that benefit yourself valuable to you?  $1,260 per year valuable?  If not, then yeah, you should definitely look into moving, because otherwise you'll be competing on price for your apt with people who do get whatever value there which you don't.

Hope that helps."

maowsers93,BabyBumps,1389597305.0,"I've quite multiple things including alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, and an eating disorder. If I can do all of that you can sure as shit do it too. I'm just like everyone else. Here is what I did that made the world off difference in my ability to stay off the specific substances. 

A. First and foremost tell everyone! This sounds awful, trust me I know. Telling everyone what a waste case I was was the worst moment of my life, but you have to because if you don't you won't be able to hold yourself accountable. As long as it is a secret it will remain an issue that you can hide. As soon as you put it out there the world holds you accountable. Trust me, telling people almost immediately shuts the door to your sneaking around. 

B. It is going to be terrible. I'm not going to blow smoke up your ass. Quitting smoking is physically, mentally, and emotionally taxing. It is like losing a best friend. I was able to do it by thinking of a particular situation every time I wanted a cig. For me it was reminding myself of my family's heart problems. For you it is clearly your baby. When you want a cig think ""No, my baby is more important than my cig""

C. Take it day by day. You don't have to think of it as quitting forever. I could never have quit anything if I took that approach. Think of it as just not doing it right now. I would tell myself ""I just won't smoke right now, but if I want to tonight then I will"" and then when night rolled around I'd say the same thing. Step by step, little by little you'll get there. 

D. Get gum, candy, carrots, straws, or anything you can can put in your mouth. The hand to mouth motion is a big part of smoking. Chew on stuff when you want a cig. I picked carrots because I could hold them to my mouth and they weren't bad for me. 

PM me if you want to talk or need some support. Good luck! I know you can do it. 

Edit: To add one more thing, since you're so far along you should really talk to your doctor before you quit. Doing it cold turkey might have an effect on the baby. When I quit it was a really bad shock. I got really sick and started having breathing problems. I know other people who had horrible coughing fits. You could be totally fine but it is better to check first I think. "

SuperShamou,Showerthoughts,1389597329.0,"""Amateur Astronomers"" accomplish far more than the professionals.  The pro's are usually tied up researching known theories, but rarely experimenting thus rarely making the spectacular discoveries.  It's the amateur astronomer who most often finds new comets, discovers new methods for detecting exoplanets, or creates those beautiful images you see in magazines.  Even the images you see from the Hubble and Kepler telescopes, the professionals are using the data for scientific analysis.  All Hubble data is shared online and amateurs are the ones spending days processing that same data into the stuff worthy of magazine covers and calendars. 

To clear up the term ""amateur astronomer"", the ones making the discoveries are often very wealthy engineering types with a PhD in some science who have built private observatories with several million dollars invested in a purposed building and its equipment, but they are still amateur astronomers, nonetheless."

I see subreddits like /r/BBW and like I said, that's great if it works for those people and it's a symbiotic relationship, but it's unfair to expect that those are the only people you should subject yourself to because they are the only people who find you sexy. I'd rather have nobody find me sexy, than have someone find me sexy because of something within themselves, not something sexy within me.

Again, I don't know if I have much room to talk since I haven't experienced this firsthand, but it's something I notice and it would certainly bother me to date a man who fetishized my fat. I know I could do better, and I think most fat women can do better than that too if they desire."

OnlyFoolin,writing,1389597530.0,"Usually context provides abundant clues to help me figure out the approximate meaning of an unfamiliar word. If I run across the word a few more times, the meaning sticks. If I don't, then it's a rare word and I guess it's okay if I don't know what it means.

If you're finding yourself facing a lot of unfamiliar words recently, then maybe you're in a new environment. You're hanging out with a new group of intellectual friends, or you've started a job with a distinct work-related vocabulary, or your interests have pushed you toward novels that are more challenging. The incomprehension that troubles you is actually a sign of growth and learning. It's a good thing to encounter a lot of words you don't know. And you will master them the way we all do, naturally and effortlessly. It's great that you are looking them up. Although the definitions you read fade quickly from conscious memory, psychologists say the knowledge is almost certainly still in your brain somewhere, and it will surface eventually if it is sufficiently needed.

It's impossible to count the number of words in English with any accuracy. Some counters would say ""dog,"" which has distinct meanings as a noun and as a verb, should be counted as two words, others as one. Are ""dreamed"" and ""dreamt"" two words? Start counting and you quickly become flummoxed by the task. But the folks at the OED reported a year or so ago that by their count, the language had exploded past a billion words.

No one knows 1,000,000 words. Luckily, no one has to. Google a bit and you'll discover that a small handful of words (or lemmas; you can't avoid learning that word if you read about this subject) account for 95% or more of spoken and written communication.

So give yourself a break. You are no doubt acquiring new vocabulary, though it doesn't feel as if you are doing it quickly enough. Keep challenging yourself. And kudos to you for using the dictionary. You're doing great."

Then I have some guy come over and install all the shit. Then when I want to cancel, I have to spend 2 hours on the phone doing so. Then depending on my cable provider, I'm probably going to have to return the equipment to a brick and mortar location myself.

The alternative is downloading each episode in 10 minutes whenever the hell I want. 

Companies like Time Warner are going to stomp their feet about piracy and not actually do anything to offer a service to people like me. Why? Because HBO is a subsidiary of TW, and they think forcing people to subscribe is more profitable (and they're probably right)."

Pherrot,poker,1389597549.0,"First part of the question, assuming we know nothing about the villan, I still need more information such as stack size, their stack, position etc. Assuming deep stacks and I am in position I might call more often and see a flop, look to take it away or out flop more often. If its against a good post flop player who has aggressive play I'll push here because I am less likely to take it down post flop.

An interesting stack dependent play is to check the flop assuming they are likely to fire at it and push all in over the top - this looks scarier IMO and leaves you with the last play.

If I get a 742 rainbow ill bet hard on the flop, chances are they missed - if you end up sticking it all in and see AA, KK or QQ its just bad luck and its going to happen to everyone."

He and I are poly, so we see other people. He helped me get sober over the last year and things were barely calming down when I realized that I am trans. He says he'll support me if I go through a few years of Therapy first because he doesn't think I am trans. Also, he's straight. 

The poly is relevant because he is now dating a trans guy who just started hormones. This will kind of be a way for me to tell if his attraction to me will dissolve as I approach my ideal body.

My plan is to save up enough for top surgery in two or three years. I think my parents will help me through recovery, they did with knee surgery. I have to do it before I turn 25 so that I can be on their insurance, but I'll be paying all the out of pocket costs.

I'll start on hormones as soon as social transition seems possible. Maybe next year, maybe in 5 years.

Just because the system is SUPPOSED to have experts making decisions doesn't mean they will. Instead of having EXPERTS, we could very well have ""experts"" (*makes Dr. Evil quotation gesture*), which is a code word for bureaucrat, or shill or some other corrupt official that doesn't belong there, excluding positions he disagrees with.

I'm dating a trans guy right now and he's perfect because I'm romantically very into men, but I love the female body"

einTier,BuyItForLife,1389598152.0,"I am going to go the other route and say *get all that shit out of your car*.  Maybe not you, specifically, but for people in general.  

If you're driving to Land's End, you'd best be carrying all this and more.   If you constantly find yourself well away from civilization and miles from any other humans, you should start thinking about this kind of thing.  But the average commuter?  I'm the biggest ""better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it"" advocate, but hear me out on why you should toss it. 

First, you don't need it.  You really don't.  When was the last time you *needed* a German military shovel?  Sure, they're indestructible and BIFL, but what's the scenario you're going to use it in?  If you already have one, when was the last time you used it that you weren't making a ""I have this shovel and here's the perfect excuse to use it"" excuse?  Probably never, unless you're the above guy with a Land Rover you take far off road every weekend. 

Same with the high lift jack.  Yup, it's the best damn jack you can buy.  You could lift the heaviest lifted truck you can find out of the most washed out arroyo in the country with that thing.  *Goddamn* is it a good jack.  But do you *need* it?  Seriously, when was the last time you got your car so far off pavement it got stuck?  I can't even remember the last time I got a flat tire that wouldn't hold enough air to get back home because tires have gotten that good.  My last two cars didn't even come from the factory with a spare tire, just a compressor and some fix-a-flat.   A jack isn't going to do me a damn bit of good.  If you do have a spare, you should have a perfectly serviceable factory jack tucked away neatly nearby.  

I could go on and on with the detritus that most people carry around in the trunk of their car.   Most of it is ""in case shit happens"" kind of items, but it's all for shit that never actually happens anymore.  You paid good money for all that stuff and you put it in one of the worst environments for anything to live.  Cars are often extremely hot and extremely cold, there is excessive vibration, routine g-loading in multiple directions, and depending on where it's stored and the condition of the car, there can be excessive or sudden moisture and humidity.   Short of throwing your shit in the ocean, it's hard to conceive of a much more harsh environment.   

That means all that pretty shit you bought for life isn't going to be very nice for very long, especially the more of it you carry.   That high lift jack is great, but it's heavy and the day you forget to secure it, it's going to bash all your shit to hell and back.  If you're really unlucky, it'll put a nice reverse dent on the outside of the car as it bangs around loose in the trunk.   When you finally find an excuse to use it -- *hey, that guy has a flat, I'll use my cool jack so he doesn't have to fight with the factory bullshit jack in all this rain* -- you'll find it's all dirty and muddy when you put back in the car.   Which, in turn, makes the inside of your car all dirty and muddy. 

In time you'll stop caring, which means you'll put more dirty, filthy tools in there and they'll continue to bang up all your other tools and devalue your car with the mess they make inside.  Plus, hauling all that extra weight around costs fuel.  Not a lot, but if you carry an additional 6% of weight around, you'll notice the impact on your fuel costs over time.  So, all it does is cost money time and time again for a bunch of stuff you're not ever really going to need and you'll only use because you happened to have it with you. "

* cheerios

* raisins

* m&amp;ms (of any variety you like, but i think plain works best)

optional variations:

* mini marshmallows

* honey nut cheerios

* chocolate/peanut butter chips

* goldfish

* other nuts (cashews, almonds, etc)

the poor man's version is just cheerios, peanuts, and m&amp;ms or raisins, for sweetness. the full version has the perfect mix of salty, sweet, and savory flavors, and varied textures. also very satisfying to eat a handful at a time. the pretzels and the cheez-its can be a little awkward with the size difference, though. pretzel sticks and goldfish substitutions might solve that problem. the optional variants can change up the flavor proportions, adding more sweetness or more savory flavors.

A good chunk of white guys I know who have ""Asian fetishes"" only do so because they've had better responses from Asian girls. 

For every white guy I've met who had the gall to admit he had an Asian preference there were two or more Asian girls who'd make racist excuses for their own preferences:

- ""Oh I don't date Asian guys. I have an Asian mother. You *know* how they are like. Wouldn't want to end up having two through marriage, right? Hahaha...""
- ""Asian guys are a bit too shy... I want someone more outgoing, like a white guy.""
- ""All the Asian guys look too much like my father...""

I used to have preference for Asian women, and most I dated were Asian. It happens when Asians are an overrepresented in elite universities and I was actively looking for multilinguals (specifically Chinese, Korean, and Japanese).

i_lick_telephones,TwoXChromosomes,1389598930.0,"I struggle internally with similar things. On one hand, I myself am not a religious woman and through limited studying, observe that religion has the influence to be detrimental to a person's expression of sexuality. In that sense, the inhibition of one's sexuality, I think religion can be toxic. Or really any organized group that mandates particular doctrines to follow. However, on the other hand, I desire so strongly to be a person of peace. I want to live and let live, within reason. I'm still trying to figure out what that ""within reason"" entails. It's very confusing for me, and causes much conflict within myself.

Ultimately, the closest answer I can confidently arrive at, is that spirituality is such a continuum that is so flexible and complex in nature, that banning it would be senseless and inhumane. To say that all spirituality is negative is completely false. It is near impossible to argue it doesn't have its merits. However, we must also accept that to indoctrinate children and to instill firm doctrines from the orders of those higher up can be a dangerous game to play. We have to examine what we're teaching women and men. We need to look at the merits of these doctrines. Are they relevant in this time? Is this doing more harm than good? Etc. Do not ban the religion; ban the reprehensible teachings.

I'm fairly aware of the general Catholicism views. Some I take huge issue with and I think need to be extinguished, and others I take no issue with. I don't think gay sex/marriage should be banned, I don't think sex should solely be for the purpose of procreation, I don't think teaching sex outside of marriage is wrong should be taught, and I think it's so dangerous to dis-encourage birth control for young women.

As another poster said, religion is what you make it. If you make it a positive thing in your life, and no one is directly negatively affected by your actions regarding religion, I can't see the harm. However, when sexuality is obviously being inhibited or limited in any way, I think it's sad and inhumane. I think it's a violation of our human rights. "

As far as the Biggie and Pac thing goes, they weren't really associated with each other that much until around the final year that they died in. 2Pac had been around since Digital Underground, and I think 2Pac's first album dropped around '90 or so. Biggie didn't get famous until about '93, and it wasn't through 2Pac. I was sort of out of the hip hop loop between 93 and 96 for the most part, but from what I remember it wasn't until supposed east and west rivalry days that their names started getting mentioned in the same sentences. As far as their agendas went, it didn't really matter; they were rappers and people lumped them together off that aspect. Plus, most of 2Pac's socially aware raps happened in the early 90s and it was mainly Pac's final years at Death Row where his raps were more violent in content.

Who doesn't like it? It's stupid, it's a hazard. But I guess dumb drivers like it as they're too cautious to overtake a bus when it's taking a while to load and unload passengers. So they just back the traffic up, and people can't come out of a joining street, either left or right. Only takes 5 or so cars in some bus stops. Other bus stops it's not that big a problem as it'd take like nearly 50 metres of cars, over 9 or so cars, or 8 given how some people have such huge personal space around their car. Truck drivers (and most other good car drivers) hate it when people leave a car space in front of them at traffic lights for example, block up exit lanes to turn and lights are green but you can't go because it's blocked.

&gt;He is lucky that he only lost a finger tip as opposed to his whole hand. The block Neo below is about 4"" by 2"" by 2"" N45 with a pull force of around 700 lbs (320 kg). The disk is about 3"" dia. by 2 1/2"" thick N45 with a pull force of about 400 lbs (180 kg)

I figure if I had ten kilograms of magnet and tossed it at our veteran knight friend, he would stick together and be pretty well immobilized. He'd have no idea what happened. I don't think he'd be able to swing his sword at all. It would get stuck to the magnet which would get stuck to him.

Hopefully his suit of armor is very complete, if so it becomes his prison. The magnet may even crush the armor against him, especially with that shield on his back. From there I stab and slice any gabs in the armor with my arsenal of daggers and spikes made from the best metals which are adequately non-magnetic, possibly platinum.

If his armor is less complete and he is able to wrestle out of it quickly my odds drop. I guess I'd be wearing a full kevlar suit. Nothing too heavy because this guy could just wrestle and strangle me and I need mobility. I'm tall, did adult karate for five years, and am not out of shape, but I still think my odds against naked knight are just 50/50. The daggers in both my hands would be mightily attached to my suit so he couldn't steal them.

However this guy has ""seen some shit"". He'll probably be taunting me as I swing wildly, freak my shit, and tire myself out. It's possible he jumps in and makes me stab myself with my own weapons before I land a good blow.

**Edit:** Initial conditions for valid weapons were unclear, I thought ""not designed for combat"" was OK, thus magnet. OP changed it, oh well."

p3ndulum,poker,1389599383.0,"It depends on the opponent and how deep the stacks are.

The tighter the opponent and the shallower the stacks would have me leaning towards folding most of the time.

We're either losing to an over pair, in which case we're around 7.5:1 against to improve on the flop, and facing a 3-bet means we'd have to be reasonably certain that we can to get at least another 60+ big blinds out of them after we hit, or we're against two over cards and goin to see over cards to our pair on the flop like 70%'ish of the time.

We'll probably check-fold like 50% of flops when we flat, and then a huge number of turns, assuming that we don't improve. And even when we do improve, it might prove to be extremely difficult to get the chips we need to make flatting/set-mining profitable (against a tight opponent).

I think that when you weight the two scenarios (vs. tight opponents), it's better to just fold and concede your initial raise.

If, however, the opponent is loose and the stacks are deep, we'd have to consider things like the possibility that they could be making the play with a much wider range of hands, including things like smaller pairs and suited connectors.

Additionally, it's much easier to build bigger pots against looser opponents, so playing to improve to a set becomes much more profitable. 

And if you have decent reading skills, playing passively to the river could keep you close to break even between the times you lose/have to fold and the times your hand holds up at showdown, making whatever you gain from improving to a set vs hands that villain might be willing to stack off with all profit.

I don't really ever like 4-betting because of villain's calling ranges + 5-bet ranges. We'd have to fold to almost all 5-bets and if our 4-bet is called, post-flop play is going to be extremely difficult on most flops and boards.

So, versus **tight** opponents and **shallow** stacks, I would say **Fold** &gt; **Call** &gt; **Re-raise**, heavily favouring a **Fold** and hating a **Re-raise** very much. And against **loose** opponents and **deep** stacks, I would say **Call** &gt; **Fold** &gt; **Re-raise**, only moderately favouring a **Call**."

i think whoever said it down below said it best. being in a LDR does not, by default, make you better than someone in a closer relationship. it's different, and the ones that last can be stronger for it. but the fact that it's long distance doesn't give you the right to disrespect more traditional arrangements.

codayus,javascript,1389599831.0,"Well, you make a lot of interesting points.  Unfortunately, I would say that they are pretty mucn uniformly wrong.  So much so that I'm not sure there's any point continuing this discussion.

So the short form is, I disagree completely.

The long form is:

&gt; It really depends on what you think of a ""real application"". 

Anything large and maintainable.

&gt; I'm talking about loosely coupled modules that talk to each other with events. 

That's not a bad pattern if architected carefully.  Like any pattern, it has some very major pitfalls, of course.  One of the largest is a failure to actually modularize the app.  The key is to make sure that each module doesn't need to know or care about the internals of other modules.  An event bus actually works fairly well here; the sort of binding you're discussing...less so.

&gt; Like a purchase action coupled with an analytics action. 

As I said; you wouldn't implement *that* in *this* way.  Passing click events onto a bus and having subscriber modules listen?  Sure!  But what you are suggesting is that my analytics module needs to know the most intimate details of how the *template* for my *purchase module* is implemented.  We have a phrase for this; it isn't ""modular"" or ""loosely coupled"".  Having gone down that road before, I'd lean towards ""maintainability nightmare"".

(Further:  You are suggesting that the analytics module needs to depend on the DOM.  Please, take my advice:  Don't do this.  If there's *ONE* thing Angular got right, it's the notion that touching the DOM needs to be incredibly limited, because every time you touch the DOM you break modularity, make things tightly coupled, and as a bonus nightmare, you make it hard/impossible to unit test.  There are a lot of ways to decouple an analytics module from the DOM; if you don't like MVVM you can do it with events.  But you need to do it.)

&gt; Or sometimes you don't have access to the HTML code at all. Think of building a Gmail plugin for example. You must build an external module. There is no way you have access to the HTML directly.

That cuts both ways; if you'd ever tried to do that you'd know that one of the huge challenges of using the event binding style you advocate is...you don't have control over the DOM.  Gmail famously uses a very cryptic DOM, without easy or clear ways to construct selectors to get the nodes you want.

Again, however, this isn't modular.  Which is fine; you're writing a plugin for Gmail without any sort of API; of course you need to know every detail you can scrape together of Gmail's design and functionality.  Your plugin will live and die by your ability to somehow figure out what Google is doing with the DOM, and it'll break every time Gmail updates.  But that isn't a *good* thing; it's something you're forced into because you don't control the DOM.  What you want is modular design, which is entirely incompatible with the approach required of a Gmail plugin; that's not a good reason to abandon modular design everywhere.

&gt; Your ""real application"" is in fact that simple chat application that works best with only one developer wich access to all resources. Your first example is exactly what people refer to as ""spaghetti code"" – a hard coded onclick attribute where JavaScript is mixed with HTML.

This is just *so* wrong I wasn't sure if it was even worth replying.

First:  Your example is actually much harder to maintain with multiple devs; keep in mind *YOU* are the one who wants modules to invisible depend on the templates of other modules.  Which means that, as a Module A dev, you don't have the slightest idea which modules, if any, will break when you change your template.  That's okay if you're *also* the Module B, C and D dev.  If you arent, it isn't.

Second:  That's not what people refer to as spaghetti code.  Like many people, you have internalized the old hatred of onclick handlers (good!) without realising or understanding why that prohibition existed.  **The problem lies when you mix logic with presentation.**  Is that a terrible sin?  Yes!  Can you *do* that with Knockout?  Sadly, yes.  You can put arbitrary JS expressions into your templates, and that is a terrible thing which makes kittens cry.  Did I do it in my example?  No.

&gt; I can see you are heavily biased on MVVM architectures 

Not at all.  MVVM works okay, but I just used Knockout as an example because it's easy and concise.

&gt; I think ""most cases"" here are the small applications and modular applications are the rest of the cases. HTML spaghetti is clearly the bad part of MVVM and data-binding. This is the drawback of Angular and Knockout and this is why Knockout has developed those unobtrusive event handlers in the first place.

So your argument is that Angular doesn't work for large apps, but Backbone does?  This is a...um....novel assertion.  You might want to provide some sort of citation for it, considering how many pixels have been spilled about how Backbone scales poorly while Angular works really well for large apps.

And as noted, you are badly misusing ""HTML spaghetti""; you're trying to argue that HTML spaghetti is *ANY* link between the controller and the presentation, UNLESS the link is invisible, because somehow that makes things better and more maintainable.  Sorry, but that's not how that works.  My jQuery example was 100% as much ""HTML spaghetti"" as my Knockout example; both tightly coupled the DOM of one module to every module that referenced it, with the added drawback of the jQuery example that it was invisible.

&gt; MVVM is a poor pattern for modular code.

As you have demonstrated in somewhat painful detail, you don't appear to have the foggiest idea what modular code is.

Here's a thought exercise that may help you:  If code is truly modular, you could trivially unit test it.  Angular code tends to be easily unit testable, due to their focus on seperation of concerns, DI, and not touching the DOM in controllers.  (Although I should note that you *can* write terrible, non-modular Angular code)  Conversely, the Backbone/jQuery style you are advocating tends to be extremely difficult to unit test, due to the tight coupling, manipulation of the DOM throughout the app, globals, etc.

What do you think this tells us?

Edit:  Stalked your profile, and found your comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1pokog/riotjs_a_1kb_clientside_mvp_framework/cd4eimv?context=3) where you were asked about testing and replied:

&gt; Riot uses events as the fundamental building block for separating concerns. There is absolutely nothing wrong with sending events. This comment made me assume you are using MVVM pattern (Angular, Knockout etc..) which uses data-binding instead of events and it's a competely different way of separating concerns.

Quite right!  Which makes it all the more confusing that you would have linked to (and written?) this nonsense:

&gt; In two-way data binding you explicitly define the behavior for a HTML element. Think inline style or an onclick attribute. It breaks modularity since the logic is hardcoded to an element and the behaviour is not defined inside a module; this is why developers stopped using onclick attributes in the first place.

&gt; When the behavior is attached to the element from outside using a jQuery selector the architecture becomes modular. You can add and remove multiple bindings without any impact to the other parts of the application.

&gt; Think of a new employee for example. One can build a separate module, select the same elements from the view and bind new functionality. And this module can later be removed. This is simply not possible with two-way binding because of the hardcoded nature – other team members will be affected.

&gt; This may seem like a small syntaxical detail but it's really about the big picture. Can you attach new features without touching the other parts of the client?

You were right the first time; you can, as you put it ""seperate concerns"" (ie, make it modular) using MVVM (but also with an event architecture, if you do it right, ie, not just pile a bunch of jQuery event binding on top of each other in newbie Backbone style).  On the other hand, trying to claim that using a jQuery selector *MAKES YOUR ARCHITECTURE MODULAR*?  How can you write something like that without giggling?  Loose coupling is a two way street; it's fine to be able to change one module without it affecting a second module, but if you can't change the second module without affecting the first then you have tight coupling.  That's right out of the definition on Wikipedia!"

Feroc,changemyview,1389599838.0,"&gt; Again, you keep saying integration like it's a good thing. What if your devs don't want to use Visual Studio? What if you have a tester who doesn't want or need source access? What if your developers are away from the office and don't have a reliable network connection? What about publicly sharing the repo and it's history?
I shouldn't need an IDE to access my bug tracker. Or my source repo. 

There's a web access for TFS, so you don't need any software. I don't really know why I would like to share the code of my company publicly. It's already hard enough to get a VPN access to access it from outside the company.

&gt; That happens: Look no further than Windows RT...

One reason Windows RT died is that no one used it. A better example may be WindowsXP. I just can't see any scenario where Windows itself will die completely overnight. 

&gt; My question is what recourse do you have when that happens? With open source, you have the option forking the project, with propitiatory software you don't have that option. Now, there are tools that can help with moving to something else, but that requires there be something else. 

A recourse if Windows dies? That scenario is unrealistic. Like asking what we would do if power goes out forever.

But why isn't there something else? Even in the worst case scenario we would just check out all the code and check it in again. We would lose the history, but the code would still exist. We even could use a free IDE for your .NET code.

&gt; Like the 6th most trafficked English language website in the world. And applications run by Google, Facebook, Twitter... 

Well, of course Wikipedia uses free software and the pope uses holy water, those just belong together.

&gt; Now, I've got to preface the rest of the post with the reiteration that I am not a DBA. 

Neither am I, so I guess the only thing we can do is throwing links at each other. :)

So just to answer the things I have actual knowledge in:

&gt; Is this what you are talking about? What does that do that a perl script on a crontab doesn't?

Guess you could do anything with Perl that you could do with an SSIS package, the question is: How fast can you do it and how good can manage those packages. Error handling, notifications, scheduling, multiple depending steps. Those things are within the system on a central place. That's also important if you don't want to have an IT guy to manage all those. Every project leader here could easily re-run a package or disable it. 

(*To be honest, it's very hard to say anything good about SSIS... I hate SSIS. But I guess that's the developer in me who doesn't like to use a lego technic like GUI*)

Cubes + MDX are the more important thing I guess.

Neopopulas,dayz,1389599865.0,"i think they need to adjust the spawns again, and fairly soon. I think there is a reason we always spawn on the coast, but the problem is they moved the spawns to get people away from Balota, but people STILL charge desperately in that direction because trekking inland is ridiculously hard from the east coast.

This is why Kamishovo is a killing field and there are corpses under any high object anywhere on the east coast. People still want that western spawn and will do anything to get it, and end up either charging to balota anyway or being killed in Kamishovo.

I think it would pay off if the military bases were spread out a little more and weren't all in a big line on the western edge of the map. That way people could find what they wanted without everyone basically just running towards the western side of the map as quickly as possible and all bunching up on that side to murder each other.

Either spreading out the military bases, or making people spawn at more of the small inland towns would be a good way to fix the problem of everyone jumping on the highway and being murdered as soon as they pass kamishovo"

Earlier in the season they didn't show any intent to have a go at us. I worry that Mou's going to see an opportunity to put on the pressure and go for it. 

Big question is Rooney here. I don't see him playing 90 but we need him to move the ball up the pitch because Carrick doesn't look quite back in it yet and our wing option are still eh. I think we could use other players but we've yet to really adopt a modern full team press. I think if we adopted that system then we could have Kagawa in here - even with a mediocre midfield connecting it up to him because it compensates for the defensive downsides. Hopefully he's not on a wing because if he's on the left, Hazard is just going to burn us badly.  Argh I just feel like we're short personnel. Valencia needs a good kick in the ass to take it up a level. Young had some decent games but I still don't trust him. 

Valencia Rooney Jan with Welbeck up top seems likely. I think Valencia Kagawa Jan could work well if Fletch has a decent game. I think we're fucked if he gets played on the wings. Maybe Kag in the hole to start with Rooney thrown on if we're not winning possession/ later on so his legs aren't too stressed. "

TryUsingScience,changemyview,1389600154.0,"&gt; non-Greek organizations on campus are not subject to the same regulations

But what do those organizations bring to the university? Let's say the hockey team throws parties. Okay, but they also play hockey, which benefits both the players and the university. The theatre club probably throws parties. But they also put on plays. And so on. 

What does the Greek system do besides throw parties? Sure, they're great for networking for their members, but what do they do for the rest of the student body and for the university itself? You'll hear about charity events and whatnot but that isn't an integral part of their function and it's not a certainty that all frats or sororities do those kind of things like it is a certainty that the hockey team plays hockey.

No wonder the school wants to regulate them - all the downsides of all the other groups, none of the upsides. There's nothing they can point to and say, ""this enriches the students and brings the school money"" to justify any outcry over potential wrongdoing in the Greek system like they can with every other organization.

alexhamiltonishot,AskWomen,1389600500.0,"When I was little I thought I was beautiful. My parents and their friends and everyone else told me so. In Kindergarten and 1st grade I was in a class of 10 kids; All the other girls in the grade unanimously agreed that I was the prettiest when we discussed it and all the boys had crushes on me and would chase me around the playground at recess trying to kiss me (side note: I know that sounds cute but it was actually awful and terrifying. I really hated it and didn't want them to kiss me and I could never play with my friends during recess because too busy running away from them. But they'd often devise a strategy to surround me then they'd catch me, push me over, get on top of me and kiss me repeatedly and if I tried to scream they'd attempt to french kiss me. But that's another story)

So I grew up with the impression that I was drop dead gorgeous. When I moved to another state and the kids treated me differently I rationalized their behavior in ways that fit my worldview. In elementary school, I convinced myself that the boys who bullied me were just trying to cover up their crushes on me and girls who bullied me so much were just jealous that I was prettier than them. As ridiculous as that sounds now, I truly believed it at the time.

It wasn't until I was 16 that I realized that I wasn't nearly as pretty as I thought I was. At this point no guy I liked had ever liked me back. I was thinking about how I boy I really liked had rejected me when I asked him out (technically he didn't actually say no he said yes but he didn't know when he was free so he'd contact me later and we'd work it out. But then he never did and ignored me for the next few months when I tried to contact him.) I was confused and hurt and I didn't understand why he'd do that when I realized that the my life post-1st grade would all make a hell of a lot more sense if I was ugly. So I decided that I must be ugly.

Since then, guys have shown more interest in me and I've started to reconsider my opinion of myself. When I look in the mirror, I think I look pretty, but I thought that when I looked in the mirror in 3rd grade too, and I can tell from pictures that I really was ugly then. So, in all honesty, I have no idea if I'm pretty or not.

Here are some pictures of me. http://imgur.com/a/eAdaN Decide for yourself; I'm tired of trying to.
