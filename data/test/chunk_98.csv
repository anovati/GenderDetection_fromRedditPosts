&gt;You also have to put his laissez Faire politics in their contemporary context.

To understand them, yes. To make a moral judgement, which is what this topic is ostensibly about, supposed context is often used to muddle the issue, like so:

A. ""Genghis Khan killed millions of people, raping and enslaving his way across Eurasia.""

B. ""Yeah, but the Mongols were more religiously tolerant than most contemporary societies.""

So, while placing his Laissez Faire attitudes in the contemporary context may explain them, it does not excuse what they contributed to."

I know it's more stringent because I've had them reject my addon for various reasons now and then and had to make corrections...

He kinda just stood around sifting through the fridges, picking stuff up and putting it back. Trying to look busy. I picked up some ruffles (sour cream and onion, the best kind) and paid and left the store. He didn't buy anything, and he looked up when he saw me leaving the store and we made eye contact.  
I started walking home, at a fairly brisk pace. I could still feel his eyes on me. I turned around and he was about 10 meters behind me walking on the sidewalk on the other side of the street. AND HE WAS STILL LOOKING AT ME. I immediately called my friend (who lived a block closer to the store than I did), asked if I could come over quickly, and took my keys out of my pocket and held them in between my fingers.

Sornos,AskReddit,1391188401.0,"It's kinda a shame that this is the modern Western perception of the Haiku. A haiku is all about the the juxtaposition of two ideas. It's what makes the form interesting. Managing to, in such a small restricted format, get the poem to cut deeply. Look at this one for example by Buson

    piercingly cold
    stepping on my dead wife's comb
    in the bedroom

The cut is more than just realizing that his wife is dead. It's that the cold on his foot is both the physical coldness of the comb, but the sudden reminder of the loss of his wife.

Haikus also rely on the natural or seasonal imagery. While the aforementioned poem doesn't seem too natural, it was included in Buson's autumn collection. The chill in the first line is about more than just the actual comb. It's the chill of the coming winter. The entire season is a reminder of death, after all. 

Here's one by Basho

    The old pond;
    A frog jumps in —
    The sound of the water.

The natural imagery is obvious here, but the cut isn't as seemingly deep as the one with Buson. This poem requires a firm imagination on the moment. A still pond, and then a sudden ""plop!"" of a frog disturbing it. See the juxtaposition? It also works with regards to the fact that the pond is an old one. The pond is ancient, but the sound of the frog will be gone soon after it is heard. More interesting is the peacefulness of the ancient pond disturbed by something so fleeting as a frog jumping into it. 

I know this sounds like a bunch of pretentious drivel, but poetry is really interesting to get into deeply. With good poetry, there's almost always depth that will reward any effort put into exploring it.

tl;dr Haiku are more than just a structured list of syllables. "

rocky8u,changemyview,1391188459.0,"I think part of the issue is that vets may not have the kind of experience necessary to find good jobs without employers reaching out to them. Guys who enlisted right out of high school likely never had to make a resume, apply for jobs, or do an interview. They spent their adult life up to getting out being told when to sleep, eat, run, and talk. Perhaps it is necessary for employers who need men and women with military skill sets to reach out and find those guys, because up until the end of their enlistment, they never had to find a job themselves.

In addition, there are a lot of employers who are afraid to hire combat veterans due to the possibility of them having PTSD or other disabilities as a result of their combat experience. I think a lot of the ""hire veterans"" stuff is targeted at helping the combat vets find jobs, as they have a high rate of unemployment and homelessness."

FactualPedanticReply,AdviceAnimals,1391188587.0,"Disagree all you want, but it's still art. Art doesn't need universal consensus to be art. The illegal scribbles that some people vandalize with may be crude, but they're still self-expression in a visual medium with symbols and images. Whether you think something is worthy of praise or respect doesn't affect its status as art; you might think a largely unadorned Mondrian canvas hanging in an art museum ""shouldn't count"" as art because of its simplistic nature and relative lack of skill required - your opinion doesn't make that ""not art"" either. The difference  between crude graffiti and that Mondrian is that society in aggregate has, by and large, determined that the Mondrian is to be praised and respected, while the crude graffiti isn't. This wholly valid judgment still doesn't mean it's not art!

It's possible you can't understand what would drive someone to create graffiti, but it's pretty likely you can. You were a teenager once, odds are, even if you aren't now. You probably understand the existential angst, the fundamental dissatisfaction with the rules of ""ownership"" in your world, the recognition that death will come for you before you manage to make an enduring mark on the world. I'm in my late 20's and I still have these feelings. The reason I don't create graffiti isn't because I don't have the motivation; it's because my consideration for other people's property and rights outweighs my desire to act on the impulse. I can totally understand being more apathetic to the rights and desires of others. The illicit nature is part and parcel to the message and meaning of this kind of self-expression. 

So it is artistic self-expression. It's just illegal artistic self-expression that's often obnoxious and crude. You can judge it of little or no value, but you can't unilaterally decide that it's ""not art."""

That said, what does your daughter want to do with dance? Fun activity? Potential career? You'll want to watch out for studios that put too much stress on weight loss, of course, but also watch out for ones that push kids towards being a professional dancer if that's not what your kid wants.

Well, for your wish to come true, either you need to leave, or the government needs to leave.

&gt; If the government is really so good, why wouldn't people continue to voluntarily support it?

And most of us do.

&gt; When people value a service or good, they pay producers to produce it of their own will without having any negative consequences forced on them if they do not buy the service.

Lemme put it this way, if you made the price of something free, how many people would pay for it? The US cannot pay its bills without charging people based on their ability to pay.

&gt; If government is so valuable, people will continue to contract with it.

And most of us do. Ancaps are the minority in this matter.

&gt;If people realize they can get the same services/goods at better prices or better quality, they will stop contracting the government.

And you can. It's called leaving the country.

Do you think Tesla gave a shit about all the people in society to told him to man up, settle down, and get married?  Of course he didn't.  He said, ""Nah, you all go do that.  Have fun.  Im'a go be a MAD SCIENTIST.""

Society doesn't change because people yell at it, telling it what's wrong and that it should change its ways.  Just look at the American Civil Rights Movement, and what had to transpire to bring about the kind of change that we today look at and say, ""well, duh!""  Especially if the person doing the yelling is an outsider, like we geeks.

So what do we do to make this change?  We strengthen our own community.  When we see fellow geeks feeling like sacks of shit, we step up and be the leaders of men we claim to be in our geek societies.  Instead of feeling like sacks of shit, we invite them to flirt with insanity in a mad attempt to discover the power behind Hastur's name.  

We stop shaming within our own outsider societies and refuse to tolerate it.  In short, to borrow the tired cliche, we become the change we want to see.

And as the world more and more comes to realize that we geeks have a pretty good thing going on, beyond the superhero movies and Lord of the Rings, and video games...  more people become geeks.  That is how societies change.  "

I'll try a different tactic in debating t hat I haven't practiced in a long time - just asking questions. Because reddit formatting, I'll just throw out a crapload at a time to see what your answers are, as opposed asking 1 by 1 and thus abandoning the thread early. If you don't mind. I'll have to get to it on off time too though, and I work second shift, so I can't guarantee my own speed.

On your specific god, exactly what qualities does it have? Specifically what effects does it's existence have on reality? For example, Does it do miracles, answer prayers, talk to people in word form, does it change weather, create artifacts, destroy nearly all of mankind in floods heal the sick, or do anything else that distenguishes it from non-existence?

Also, if that one is an easy answer for you, I'll ask a line of questions. Do you believe that evidence is required to assert something is true? If so, what evidence is there for your god. If not, how do you distinguish a true claim from a false one? One example is all I'd ask for."

The ""humans"" fear themselves, and their own subconscious. They know they aren't in control of their own power even when they are in control of their own power. The mutations of animals outside of their barriers show this. 

They are terrified of their children because they could become the worst case of all of their nightmares. ""Ogres"" that revel in killing, ""Karmic Demons"" that have no control on their subconscious and passively destroy the world around themselves, and possibly the worst of all children that will be ""human"" but have no powers. People they can't kill, but who will be forever jealous of the powers.

The ""monster rats"" are regular humans. They are the monsters that we are. They are capable of savagely killing each other in all the ways we do. Because of their breeding methods the savagery is a bit different, but it is all there.

You say the skin doesn't look too good. Is it acne? You should try an acne treatment on your back. /r/SkincareAddiction has great acne tips, but since it's your *back* you could just go for something like a St Ives Scrub. Maybe something with salicylic acid in it. A lotion would be best, but it's hard to find one in stores. When I would get acne on my chest, a simple St Ives Apricot Scrub daily in the shower usually helped it clear up. It's not good for your face, but other parts of your body it's okay for.

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1391189197.0,"&gt; IMO, it's about striking a balance. You need some heuristics, and you need some scientifically accurate models. My issue is that TRP is like 99% heuristics, and it's defended purely on a heuristic level. When you rely so heavily on heuristics, really bad things can happen.

Sure you need both, but this isn't a one-to-one relation. It's a one-to-MANY relation. One fact, scientific model, or even logical conclusion can generate countless ideas. Each of those ideas can in turn have countless implementations. Each of those implementations can in turn be presented in countless ways.

Again, you are very focused on things from a scientific point of view. Maybe you are a scientist. You are not considering things from the inventors', engineers', and salesmen's points of view.

Besides, what is wrong with 99% heuristics anyway? Heuristics are powerful and important in decision making. A fact by itself barely inspires action at all. 

In the fighting analogy, a standard boxing stance mitigates the damage of over 99% of typical punches you'd take thrown randomly.

In the Chess analogy, a standard opening of a few moves' depth (based on heuristics) eliminates over 99.9% of possibilities. Even just two moves, a King's Pawn opening e4 followed by a Sicilian Defense eliminates 99.75% of the game tree. That many options are wiped from consideration.

And these heuristics are all based on very few and simple statistical analyses or logical conclusions. There's not *that* much to know here, but there's certainly a lot of ways to figure out how to get some value out of it."

megawompwomp,AskWomen,1391189212.0,"For me, personally, yes. However, I wouldn't live with someone unless marriage was in the cards. My boyfriend and I recently moved in together after many months of discussion - I was clear that moving in together wasn't a replacement for marriage, but a step toward it. We needed to learn to work together on a different level than we did in the dating-but-not-living-together stage, and are still in the process.

It isn't easy - we now see each other at our worst, have minor spats here and there about things around the house, and are still getting everything in place. However, we get to start and end each day together and learn to work through any issues, and all-in-all the pros far outweigh the cons for us.

Now, to answer your question - there isn't a couple-shattering secret. I knew that he left his dirty clothes on the floor and liked to watch loud movies late at night (while I was trying to sleep) and leave kitchen cabinets open before we moved in together. I have my quirks, too. We're learning to work with each other's quirks, which is invaluable in this ""not-quite-engaged/pre-married"" stage."

He really was a nice, good-willed guy on a personal level. It's a shame that he either can't see the hypocrisy of his statements, or that his hand is forced with party politics.

This issue was even something in the campaign--people protested his debates with RINO signs cause he took these subsidies.

I really don't mean to defend him too intently, but I should say this. Fincher receives no more money than any other farmer with these subsidies. Yes he takes them, but so does EVERY other farmer. And that 3.4 million is over years and years. It isn't as outlandish when you think that he's had his farm for 20+ years. The farming economy is built with this subsidy system at it's core. To not take it would mean an inability to compete. And this money isn't lining his pockets. It's paying for insurance. Farmers have to take out loans to purchase the tens of thousands of dollars of seeds needed up front. If they have a bad year because of the weather, they face financial ruin and are probably out of the farm game. Insurance insures that we have a stable farming population who can survive taking these hits.

VincentGrayson,AskReddit,1391189438.0,"Last March, I had to drive my wife's car to work because mine was in the shop. It was snowing, and 5 in the morning, as I work pretty early. My rear tire blew, so I pulled over on the highway, in the dark, and did my best to jack the car up, remove the flat, and replace it with the donut.

Unfortunately, due to my own inexperience (having never had to do this before), and the fact that it was still dark outside, I put the tire on facing the wrong way. It fit, so I assumed it was right, got in the car, and started driving.

About 100 feet later, it starts making this terrible sound and I pull over again...surprise, the whole tire is shredded, as it was unable to turn when I put it on wrong.

So I call a tow, except of course it's early and I'm tired, so I mistakenly tell the guy I'm like, 10 minutes further down the road than I actually was. Dude totally drove right past me and calls 20 minutes later asking where I am and I realize my mistake.

Stratfor (full disclosure; I once worked there) puts out forecasts that try to be relatively systemic and released a century forecast as a book. http://www.amazon.com/The-Next-100-Years-Forecast/dp/0767923057

If you're primarily interested in population, UNPD is usually a great place to look, and they draw on a lot of research and contextual information: http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm . Keep in mind that the prevailing wisdom is still quite strongly anti-Malthusian: empirical research continues to see a general pattern of increased material prosperity dramatically lowering birthrates. 

Economic forecasts are more all-over-the-map when they try to account for systemic forces acting over long time-ranges, like to the end of this century. Some see [permanently tiny growth in many current powerhouses](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/jul/19/economy-end-growth-resource-scarcity-costs), others tend to just offer a range of scenarios without choosing between all possible alternative assumptions.

1wiseguy,space,1391189508.0,"I selected U-235 as a fuel because it has the highest energy density of any material that has been used for fuel. I didn't consider Helium-3 because it has never been used for fuel, and it isn't known whether it would work. Also, the only sources for it are on the Moon and the gas giant planets, and it isn't know whether it is possible to harvest it in large quantities. That said, switching to helium-3 doesn't solve the problem. I never said that U-235 is radioactive, but that's a well-known fact, I guess.

I didn't simply say that an inter-stellar ship with 40% U-235 fuel wouldn't work, I calculated its maximum speed. I thereby concluded that it wouldn't work. It's possible to calculate things. People do it all the time.

I never said that energy is a volume. Volume is measured in m^3, or other equivalent units. You would notice that no such quantities are found in any of my calculations. I probably said something like ""that much fuel wouldn't fit..."", but I would have meant due to its mass. 

If you read through that article about Project Daedalus, as far-fetched as it is, it has some interesting details. For example, the ship is 99% fuel and engines. It also does a 2-stage thing, where it jettisons the big engine to lose some weight. For these reasons, it can't carry engines and fuel to stop the thing at the end of the trip, without taking a horrible hit in top speed. Thus, a manned version would go much slower, maybe 5% of light speed. Thus, it would take centuries to reach an Earth-like planet, and the survival of humans would be doubtful.

oberon,WTF,1391189559.0,"There's no way in hell I'm clicking that link, but I am curious - does entering a beauty pageant involve any actual skill development?  Hear me out, please.

The video that the OP posted is undeniably inappropriate; I think we agree on that.  The girls are way too young to be dressed that way, etc.  BUT they're also obviously skilled dancers.  They're pulling off some pretty advanced dance moves, and doing them well.  These are skills that (if they choose to pursue a serious, i.e. non-stripper, dance career) will serve them well.

So what I'm wondering is - does entering a beauty pageant impart any kind of career-able skill set?

I almost feel dirty even asking that, but at the same time all I know about beauty pageants is that there's a big one called Miss America, that beauty queens have a reputation for being idiots (""World Peace!"" and bat your lashes...) and that child pageants are so revolting to me that I feel the need to power-wash my brain after acknowledging their existence because... just... ew.  But at the same time I'm worried that my gut reaction of absolute revulsion may be preventing me from acknowledging that they are *not* in fact 100% evil and that scouring them from the face of the planet would be a net benefit for humanity.

Okay, cancel that - I'm sure that any benefit a child gets from participating in a beauty pageant could be gained somewhere else.  Somewhere without all the horrible, disgusting objectification and lifelong psychological scarring that comes from treating a little kid like... well... you know.  So regardless, I'm sticking with my ""child beauty pageants need to be eliminated"" plan, but I still feel the need to look for some tiny kernel of good in the things I hate, so... have you got anything?"

Especially if I deliberately set it up to weigh heavy at the start with water retention.
JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1391189682.0,"&gt; In the 30s we cut the workweek to 40 hours via higher pay requirements, before that there was no limit and no standard, 7 day 12 hour shifts were common, even when the work was dangerous. Did this result in a cut in pay? I dont know, but I do know that because it applied to everyone, it affected everyone evenly, and compensation changed for everyone because of it.

In order to provide the same result that we get now, we'd need to establish like a $11 min wage for a 30 hour work week, and a $15 one for a 20 hour one. While the 30 hour work week might be feasible since we're currently looking into raising wages to $10 anyway, a 20 hour one would probably have destructive economic consequences.

Not to mention we'd need to tighten restrictions on salary workers too.

&gt;I think the biggest problem in thinking you have is that you seem to view ""employers"" as an organization, rather than a lot of organizations all competing against eachother.

I think it's a little of both, really. Employers like to compete, but they don't want to compete too much since this will hurt their long term profits. A big lesson in Econ 101 is to avoid price wars, which destroy profits for all companies involved.

I think a better model for economic competition is the prisoner's dilemma. You can cooperate or compete. If you cooperate, all companies win. If you complete, you might win at the gain of others if they don't. If everyone competes, everyone loses. I think because of desperation, lack of education, lack of organization, and the fact that there are often more employees than employers (which often are somewhat like an oligopoly at times), employees will compete and lose, while employers will cooperate more and win. I kind of see the minimum wage as stopping a so called race to the bottom. However, if raised too high, it could harm business in general. If automation is cheaper than hiring, which can happen if you force the wage to raise too much, then they'll just eliminate the job opening altogether.

&gt;Now, tell me why you think 10% of the nation should have to work full time so 90% can live without effort.

Because to pay a living wage, you need to pay 6x what people pay now, or close to $45 an hour for an hour of work (assuming 60% labor participation like today). Do you think businesses would be willing to do that? Maybe in the economy you mentioned, but maybe not. 

Some might also enjoy the work. There are some people who love work, and some people who hate it. If 10% loves it, then they'd be willing.

Also, there would still be financial incentives to work. Remember, you'd make basic income, but you'd also get wages too. So you'd still have more money if you choose to work.

Quite frankly, if you could find a way to cut the work week to like 8 hours in the long term, while providing the education and skills to keep people working, that's fine by me. But I kind of think trying to keep the current work ethic going will lead to lots of redundency, and would drastically raise the price of labor to ridiculous amounts if you really can cut the labor force to 10%. If the current min wage is $7.25 now, you'd need close to $15 for a 20 hour week, $30 for a 10 hour week, $60 for a 5 hour week, etc, in order to just keep the same living standards. With the $10.10 wage that might be right around the corner, we'd be talking $20 for a 20 hour week, $40 for a 10 hour week, and $80 for a 5 hour week. "

It is going to help the affluent handicapped community who likely can already afford their own retrofits if they're buying newly constructed houses in the city limits. 

This isn't going to do anything for the poor, lower, or middle class people who use wheelchairs. It might serve a home owner as they grow older or if they have to care for their parents as they age but other than that they're basically mandating that the entire city retrofit for a portion of ADA to serve the affluent disabled community.

He told me that the porn actresses were better looking than me, and then would be upset that it made me insecure. He exclusively watched women with very large breasts. I wore an A-cup at the time, and he would express to me that he wished I had a body like the actresses, but that he loved me for my personality. It was crushing.

jednorazowa,AskWomen,1391189828.0,"I wouldn't consider it, because of something that happened when I was younger:

My first sexual relationship was also his first sexual relationship, but, being teenagers, we both thought about sex a lot and had very clear ideas about what we did and didn't think was sexy.  And these ideas were perfectly compatible - we both the same things sexy and the same things unsexy.

So we eagerly dove into bed and started doing all the things we found sexy.

Time passed, we did lots of sexy things, everything was fantastic, until one day he said that he wanted to change the way we have sex.  He wanted to stop doing my very favourite sexy thing, and he wanted to start doing some things that I found repulsive.

I was shocked and baffled. At the beginning of our relationship he'd told me (on his own initiative, not in response to my preferences) that he practically fetishized my very favourite sexy thing and he was repulsed by the things I thought were repulsive.  

But it turned out that he found the reality of my very favourite sexy thing rather unsexy in practice, and that interacting up close and personal with a naked woman awakened new interests in him that hadn't been there before.

Ultimately the relationship ended, because we didn't have any mutually enjoyable sex acts.

Because of this, I wouldn't consider marrying someone with whom I haven't already been extensively sexually active.  I know it's possible for a person to have enough self-knowledge for their preferences to stay the same before and after becoming sexually active (I did), but even with 20/20 hindsight neither my first boyfriend nor I could see it any warning signs that his preferences would change.  And I wouldn't want to be eternally binded to someone with whom sex can't be mutually enjoyable."

The mounts and pets up now haven't taken away from your gameplay, and if someone else uses a honor bonus it doesn't really matter. The amount of time it takes to generate enough honor to do anything is large as it is, but a pvp season can last more than 20 weeks. So even if they can farm up honor gear faster than you, they wont be taking a giant leap ahead in the season because you have just as much access to the gear, even if it takes a little longer.

PvE is th same because even with a slight boost to xp/gear early in an expansion those boosts are removed once you clear your first raid tier. The 2nd and 3rd tiers are independent from the boost. 

Finally, I think a few posters above don't realize the LVL boost to 90 is for the WoD pre-order. Its similar to gifting a free 85 for scrolls, and that didn't ruin the game. Giving the 90 might increase subs and therefor allow all of us to have more people to quest and play with. Its a win win.

If you have a guild to run these dungeons with you that'd be perfect. You can use tokens to get rares (LV68+) and exotics for ectos. Get the soldier stuff from the ectos to get the insignia, mostly use a black lion kit to salvage them if you own some of these. 

Farm every orichalcum or ancient wood node you find with every char you own on every map. Check http://gw2nodes.com/ for fast harvest. 

Go to Orr and do every event you can but mostly do Gates of Arah, Grenth and Melandru whenever they're up. But also the events at Penitent Waypoint, Shelter's Gate and Jofasts are nice, additionally there's one at the Shipwreck Rock WP either. 

I even guest on other servers on some days to have the least downtime between the events. With a decent magic find you will get lots of rares for ectos, tons of weapons/armor (that you can either salvage or sell) and lots of T6 mats. Heavy moldy bags is what I farm most and I get around 1 and a half stack per day there.

AdamColligan,askscience,1391190226.0,"Sorry to revive after a few days; just saw this. One thing that you should keep in mind is that we now speak about the distinction between a natural event, like a hurricane, and a *disaster*, like what happened when a hurricane struck New Orleans. The kinds of events you may be thinking of -- hurricanes, tsunamis, wildfires, earthquakes, solar storms, etc. -- have been around since long before humanity. In general, what makes them ""disasters"" or not is the quantity of people and stuff that is put in the way of them and how prepared the people and stuff are for what's coming. The current practice is to say that a disaster has occurred when the conditions that nature provides exceed the capacity of people and their stuff in the area to cope. 

This is an interesting way of thinking because it allows you to see that the ""advancement"" of society has shifted some natural events (or ""hazards"") from being disaster-inducing to being no big deal, and it has shifted some other natural events from being no big deal to being things that could be considered disasters. Earthquakes likely mattered much less to people until they started living in buildings that could fall down on top of them. Similarly, a big solar flare pointed at the earth was always an event that happened on occasion, but it is only now that we have become reliant on sensitive electronics that it is possible for there to be a ""disaster"" induced by such an event."

These population often (unfortunately) retain their own cultural identities and aren't (for one reason or another) successfully assimilated into their new culture, which creates tensions that are no good for anyone.

am5437435,law,1391190340.0,"In order:

One  
Does society itself not have a stake in the proceedings to see cases tried on their merits?  Yes, the defendant has, should have, and should be absolutely entitled to all the protections that can be afforded him due to the complete power imbalance between state and accused in order to guarantee fairness in the trial process, but isn't the whole point of crime and punishment to see that the guilty are punished and society protected and that the innocent are set free?

Assuming that an error was made that could influence the verdict, how is the societal interest in seeing cases tried on their merits satisfied?  It isn't.

Furthermore, where is the justification for limiting the state's ability to appeal?  It's not simply that the state has more resources.  What is this point logically connected to?  So what if they have more resources?  So what if they have more power in the process?  If the trial was done wrong, it was still done wrong.

Two  
The prosecution cannot simply retry the case if the evidence is excluded.  The doctrine of *res judicata* applies.  The evidentiary ruling from the previous trial cannot be overturned by a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction.

Three  
The theoretical framework I am applying here is that the trial was not conducted properly, the true merits of the case were not presented to the jury, therefore the jury's verdict is not an informed one.  If evidence was excluded, as an example, or some other error made, like the jury was instructed on a defence that should not have been made available to the jury, how can we know that the acquittal was a true acquittal?

This is not the same as saying that the prosecution gets to take the acquittal verdict and go to an appeals court and claim the jury got it wrong and should have convicted.  The jury is the trier of fact and their verdict should be given enormous deference, just the same as a judge trying the facts should be given deference due to their position within the courtroom to assess credibility and so on, something that cannot exist on a transcript page.

I don't think the state has recourse to appeals based on unreasonable verdicts, while the accused does.  Either way, it's a high standard to meet in an appeals court.

In any event, the framework is that the jury's verdict is missing something essential.  If they were given the option to acquit someone when that option was not properly available in law, then we have a jury verdict that is not legal.  If the jury heard all the evidence it should have heard, was instructed properly and still acquitted, then there's no merit to an appeal by the state and it should fail every time."

Aikidi,audioengineering,1391190406.0,"The idea is you would have a normal snare track and a trash snare track. Then you would put a noise gate on the trash track to keep it from spewing its trash all over your track. You would want to do something called keying that noise gate, so that any time the key hit a certain volume, it would open and let the trash track play. 

Then you simply make your original snare track the key, so that way every time a snare hit is loud enough on the ""clean"" track, it opens the noise gate for the trash track. Then you just mix to taste. 



So you actually only need a noise gate. You would create the ""trash"" track just by super super overdriving a preamp (usually best to do this with an analog, ideally a tube preamp) so that it gets really dirty (like, turn the gain up way too high.)"

goundo,climbing,1391190492.0,"&gt;Over the past few months I've noticed both new and veteran climbers making these extremely dangerous and/or inconsiderate mistakes.

So, this is you, in your gym (maybe one or two others), over the past several months. This tells me that one of two things is going on. Either (1) you've only been climbing for a few months, and you are going through your newbie safety-crusader stage, or (2) these are recent developments in your gym that you are concerned about. 

If (1), chill out and just climb. Call people out if they are interfering with you or doing something ridiculously stupid, but if some kid is running around in the bouldering cave and someone falls on him/her, that's just a good lesson to be learned.

If (2), I hardly see how bellyaching on the internet is likely to improve things at your own gym. Go talk to the community or gym management, but whining on the internet about the guy who was doing laps on a route you wanted to do isn't going to solve anything. If gym management doesn't care about your concerns, and the community is ignoring you, just take up the issues with offenders on an individual basis in civil manner. Or else go to the gym when it is less crowded.

danhakimi,changemyview,1391190526.0,"I need some help, and I don't mean to burden you more for having made a good comment, but... I think you can help me, so I'm going to ask.

See, everything you've said seems pretty obvious to me. I've looked at /r/seduction and /r/theredpill and been thoroughly and appropriately disgusted. But there's a reason I keep going back, and it's not just the morbid curiosity. It's because I have a question (and one I think is common), and these assholes are the only ones who even seem like they're *trying* to answer it.

The question, which I've asked in a variety of ways in a variety of places, is roughly: I'm trying to be a decent human being. People generally seem to like me, sometimes. People think I'm funny. People think I'm smart. I'm not the best-looking person I know, but I don't think I'm particularly ugly either.

But women really don't seem to be attracted to me. Like, almost never.

Is there any way you can possibly help me figure this out: What am I missing?

The assholes use the word ""confidence"" as code for, and more thoroughly recommend, behavior quite like the above. Something like ignoring a woman when she says no, and making it clear to her that you want to have sex with her right there on the spot. Something like that. Of course, I'm not looking for one night stands, I'm looking for a woman I can talk to, and they don't understand that--but that's not really the problem. The problem is their method, and its inherent douchenozzle quality. But... They're the only people who seem to be answering what I'm asking.

If I'm not an asshole -- if I'm really a nice person... what, if anything, am I doing wrong?

The answer might be that nice guys finish last, and women like assholes. Insofar as that is the case, I resign myself to being alone. I've said it before and I will say it again: I'd rather be a lonely, good human being, than an asshole who women love. But... Tell me that's not true. Tell me women don't just like assholes, and I don't have to be alone.

Iunno. Again, I'm sorry for burdening you with this, and understand completely if you just didn't have the time to read it..."

Don't listen to other people! Do research for yourself before taking supplements, there is so much mis-information about nearly every aspect of lifting and eating that listening to others will only muddy up the waters. Most people haven't a clue what the hell they are talking about.

Some supplements are probably not the best for you, and some are just fine. I stick to Whey Protein or Weight Gainer supplements, with vitamins and fish oil. I have done creatine in the past and it worked great for me.

Just dive into the abyss man, you might be surprised at what happens! Lifting ended up being a lifestyle change for me, it's not just some hobby I do on the side. Nearly every one of my daily decisions is based off of my healthy lifestyle. Something as simple as, should I take the stairs or elevator?"

Also, if I'm good enough to live with, I'm good enough to marry. I don't ever want to be caught in one of those situations where we live together, and I'm eternally waiting, after hearing 'I'm not ready, etc tec' for about 5 or so years. I know someone who's been in this position for around 10 years, and it makes me wary. 

I don't think I'm gonna have any sort of option if we break up and I'm left without a home. No, I would never consider living with someone who doesn't want to be with me after having such a great deal of history. I'm extremely sensitive and heartbreak is tough for me to handle. 

I find some sort of allure in missing my partner when I go home. 

These are my personal preferences, I don't really care who else lives with who and I never judge people who live together, but I can't handle any sort of uncertainty that comes with just dating them while living together.

pizzaandburritos,dating,1391190625.0,"I see where you are coming from. It's tough to say what you should look for. Women who care a lot about being driven will probably see you as immature for not being more driven with your career, and they will interpret your hobbies and your lack of desire for children as a sign that you're a big baby. So avoid women who think like that. They will only look down on you. 

Only you know whether you are actually immature. I can't judge that by your description. But you can either make an effort to avoid being perceived that way, or to just own it and be upfront about it. I think either way is valid, depending on what your goals are. What do you care most about in your life? Ask yourself, what is the reason you get up in the morning? Does it align with what you spend the most time on? 

For the most part, people don't like lazy people. People like people who have a passion. I think it matters less what it is. If you are really devoted to your family business, that is a plus regardless of how much money you make. But honestly, if your main concern is playing games and watching movies, I guess I would feel like that's lazy. I mean, if you're passionate about it and study it on some sort of intellectual level, I would be impressed. If you know a lot about the history, and how they are made, and so on. Otherwise those are very average pursuits. Most women don't look for average boyfriends.  



When you meet these women online, how soon do you meet them? Personally, I think it saves a lot of time if you meet them very soon after you start talking to them. It's so hard to tell how well you get along for real unless you spend time actually together.

1. Unredeemably campy and overdone schlock (things like old Roger Corman movie marathons, disaster porn, dramatic reality TV, etc)

2. Interesting characters, in particular a character I can identify with (things like Supernatural, other genre shows I have loved, .......dramatic overdone reality TV, etc.)

I do think Supernatural stands on the chemistry and skill of its leads more than similar shows, but for me personally it could have the best writing, direction, overall storytelling and special effects in the history of entertainment and I would still hate it if I couldn't find a connection with the characters.

My fiancé is a huge Battlestar Galactica fan. I keep trying to sit down and watch it, but I can't get into it.

carpescientia,femalefashionadvice,1391190817.0,"Oh, do I struggle some days, lol. Today, I'm packing to move tomorrow and it was definitely a t-shirt and yoga pants to class kind of day. 

But thanks for the support, I tried to make it constructive, at least. 

I was trying to make the point that there are different levels between fashionista and I-look-like-I-haven't-showered-in-2-days. But the goal is to have a baseline that doesn't take so much effort, but doesn't look poorly enough for others to judge you. 

I also have neither the money nor the knowledge to be good at ""fashion"", as /u/selfcerulean describes it, thus, I'm not saying people SHOULD be judged by their appearance alone. But it's a fact of life and we all have to deal with less-than-ideal things. People are gonna judge, no matter what you wear. And sometimes that judgement might be that someone is stuck-up or high-maintenance for dressing up; it goes both ways. It's silly to pretend like you won't be assessed quickly on your appearance just because you think it's wrong. 

Just like /u/selfcerulean read my opinion about one topic and assumed  that I am a judgmental bitch in real life with no stress and all the time in the world. IRL, I give not two fucks what anybody thinks of me. I dress up because it's something I enjoy, but I never EXPECT someone else to do the same (situation-dependent). 

And yes, I meant things like post-college sweatpants in public, slippers you're trying to pass off as Uggs, a shirt that you're spilling out of, neon bra straps blatantly showing outside your racerback tank, something you keep wearing with an old stain or a hole, that super short skirt that you looked hot in...a decade ago, that sort of thing. Like...general rules for a baseline and then, you decide the degree to which you want to take it (depending on what you feel like/enjoy/how much of a shit you give about how other people treat you). Of course, certain situations call for certain attire and I will stand by that. An interview is not the time to prove your point, just put on a damn suit. "

In addition, she's almost 6 feet tall and absolutely refuses to date someone her height or shorter or anyone who's too ""skinny"" or even too *fit*, as in, muscular- she likes a guy on the husky side.  

*Then* at the same time that she is so desperate to find someone who's boyfriend material, she's not sure she wants to settle down without sleeping around some more (her words, not mine).  She had a certain number in her head that she wanted to sleep with and if she finds a relationship now she might not meet that arbitrary number and that's somehow a problem.  :/  I've tried to give her advice a thousand times, tell her when she's saying things that are totally opposite, but she's still kind of a train wreck in her love life.

portugalthephilosoph,inthenews,1391190848.0,"As a Congressional Legislative Aid living in Kansas City and writing this from my Google Fiber connection:

This bill angers the hell out of me. It was introduced by the *committee*, not any single legislator. That tells me it was written by an outside party and ""anonymously"" recommended to the committee. I'm assuming Time Warner and Comcast probably got together on this, but I don't have any definite proof of that. (Still going through the campaign finance reports)

The Vice Chair of the Senate Commerce Committee is [Susan Wagle](http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2013_14/members/sen_wagle_susan_1/), a Republican from the Wichita area. I can understand that businesses in Susan's district may feel threatened by Kansas City, Kansas' new fiber network. But, the Chair on the committee is [Senator Julia Lynn](http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2013_14/members/sen_lynn_julia_1/), who represents Johnson County (where KCK is). Why is she not standing up for her constituents who are greatly benefiting from this new infrastructure? Is the campaign cash from Time Warner that appealing?

The way this bill reads, it sounds like they pulled it directly from the pages of Atlas Shrugged. It sounds like Directive 10-289. 

Is this bill likely to pass? No. Not really. There are too many members in the Kansas Legislature that know how much of an asset that Google Fiber is to KCK and KCMO. 

And it won't pass for another reason: Because every single person that see's this thread is going to the [Members of the Commerce Committee](http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2013_14/committees/ctte_s_cmrce_1/) and PLEAD with them to vote against SB304. Don't stop calling until the bill is DEAD. Trust me, with several years experience in Congressional offices, you start to question your resolve re: a bill when the phone rings 10 times/minute with people telling you to vote against it.

Easiest way to do it is to incorporate the ticket policies of soccer teams - the curves directly behind the nets are sold to the die hard fans of the home or visiting team, the other tickets can be sold to the suits etc.  Just designate those areas as ""fan zones"" or whatever, sell the tickets cheaper, and off you go.  An interesting question would be which end you give to which team's fans.  Do you give the home team the offensive or defensive zone for the 1st and 3rd?  Do you want them to be there to celebrate goals in the 1st and 3rd or to celebrate saves?

There were multiple nurses there with me and there were doctors who worked on the floor to pick up the slack for any OBs who didn't show up in time.

If I had been in my home town with it's tiny hospital and poorly related maternity ward, I probably would have done my best to stay at home. "

So do wrestlers. How many interviews/DVDs have come out where wrestlers talk about how they used to mimic their idols while also creating their own style? 

&gt;It's hard to be an entertaining actor for most people, especially when you're reciting lines.

This is why most actors don't make it to television. They're not good actors. 

&gt;The WWE has a ridiculous expectation of their talent: not only are you to be a fantastic athlete (which requires an incredible amount of time and dedication), an in-ring technicition, but you are also expected to recite lines like a professional actor.

Wrestlers *are* professional actors. The expectation to be able to learn and deliver lines is not entirely out of line, especially when you are on television. It's no different than being an action movie star except for the show being live. Can't handle it? Work somewhere else with lower expectations. 


&gt;It's just not the way pro-wrestling should be structured. There should be less acting in the traditional sense, and more improvisation, with people having bullet points to hit, but with enough autonomy to let their own personalities shine through. That's how it used to be in wrestling and that's how we got those great personalities of yesteryear.

Every company operates differently. Some of them have bullet points, some just let the guys do whatever. WWE is very conscious of how they present their product to the point that they make commentary use very specific language when calling matches. It makes sense for them to do it this way. The wrestlers just need to learn how to deliver their lines better.

GTnicholas,philosophy,1391191209.0,"My problem with prolonging human consciousness via AI is that how does one ""transfer"" a mind? Does copying every property of my mind, transfer my mind? or does it ""clone"" my mind? As such, merely creating a software which simulates the activity of my brain perfectly does not prolong my existence, but creates and prolongs the existence of my clone. When I die, I will still lose consciousness, and a very Nicholas-like software program will live on.

However there is a way to achieve this. If, that is, the theory of mind known as functionalism is true. Functionalism is the idea that what we call our ""mind"" is a function of a series of processes in my brain. Also, if it is true that not all parts of these processes are essential to performing the function, then it would be possible to maintain the function while (over time) replacing the parts in those processes. By replacing these parts with more permanent ones (like information on a disk, or in flash, or bits in a processor) we would in effect transfer our actual consciousness to a computer, because the consciousness-function would continue to be performed while this takes place. Turns out prolonging our consciousness is a much more complex task then just building the appropriately complex computer.

Also, about the animals thing. It is almost certainly the case that some higher mammals, have elements commonly associated with consciousness. Just because we are the best at it, doesn't mean that dolphins, chimps etc. don't have ""aware"" mental states. They mean even have intentionality, that is mental states that are ""about"" features of the outside world. They may even be self-aware."

piratelibrarian,AskWomen,1391191218.0,"My look has definitely lead people to make false assumptions about who I am. For instance, many think I went to art school and am a vegetarian. Nope. I went to school for business (though my rationale for that was that I'm a creative type who had NO CLUE how to make money so it seemed like a good idea to learn how to make money) and I'd be hunting down cows in fields with a fork if I didn't get a decent NY strip loin once a month. I've also got ""you're not from around here, are you?"" on many occasions. And nope again. I've been in this wee city on and off (more on that off) since I was 9 years old.

I don't get a lot of negative beyond people finding me unapproachable at first as folks assume before they meet me  that I'll be some die-hard, feminazi lefty, and while I am, to an extent as I'm all for and often speak to social justice and such, people are people and I have friends from all walks.

People are not inspired by logic. That is why self-help manuals are not boring lectures on depression, hormones, finance/budgeting.

The logic behind ""plate spinning"" idea may be as simple comparing efficiency of parallel dating vs serial dating. Parallel dating is faster. Now, different people might have different tweaks on the implementations. Some might be honest about their parallel dating, some might not.

truly, it's ok for both men *and* women to be hot - being attractive and desirable is a good thing for anyone

calling a person 'hot' at first glance is like calling a car 'hot' at first glance - it's impossible to make an accurate and comprehensive judgement about either a person or a car after just one look

finally, regarding ""objectifying"" people, have you ever heard someone referred to as a ""tank"" or a ""brick shithouse"" or a ""bulldozer"" - all are examples of comparing someone to an object, but none are negative (you'd call someone a 'tank' if they were really strong and hard to physically stop; a 'brick shithouse' is someone who's extremely tough)

So you went to explore, and you found things, but it was incredibly difficult to find anything specific.

Patches were *hard* to come by. Game magazines had a disc with some demos, cheat texts, and patches for the most popular games (at times), but mostly it wasn't a thing.

testudinidae,needadvice,1391191343.0,"&gt; Motorcycles can't go backwards, TIL. People should know this, what if they park against a wall, do they just throw their hands in the way and strip it for parts. Forever, stuck against that wall.

I didn't say motorcycles can't go backward.  I just said they can't do so with any force.  It's very difficult to push hundreds of pounds of metal backward with your legs.  If there was an impact of any force, it had to be from the car, not the motorcycle.  I'm simply raising the possibility that OP is mistaken.

&gt;The problem is that when you accept fault for an accident that is not your fault, the cost of your insurance goes up, and some ass-hat gets the opportunity to sue you for what-ever irrefutable symptoms he ""is experiencing.""

Who said OP should accept fault for anything?  The insurance company has lawyers for this.

&gt;What if I told you your life experiences don't universally apply to the rest of us?

This has more to do with reading between the lines than it does with my personal experience.

We are only getting OP's side of the story here, while the police officer was a neutral observer.  OP states that he was involved in a road rage incident, was pleading (read: ranting and raving) with the officer on the side of the road, and was treated like a dumbass.

So, the only neutral observer in this story (the cop) seems to think OP was being unreasonable.  And I totally buy that because OP had time to get a police report, drive home, get on the internet, and type out that entire post, and he still doesn't see the problem with this:

&gt;on multiple occasions mentioned that the yelling and swearing the man was doing was protected by the first amendment

If the police officer felt the need to say this multiple times, OP was repeatedly doing something that made him feel the need to do so.

&gt;I told him repeatedly I didn't care about the car, I was more concerned for my safety as this person had just tried to hurt me!

You're in a car think a motorcyclist just tried to hurt you by ramming you?  That's not a reasonable thought process.  It's like saying he tried to damage my boot with his face.  Except instead of a broken nose and a scuffed boot, there's some blood on my car and he's either in intensive care or the morgue."

H335,CCW,1391191363.0,"I would never use a lanyard for several reasons (detailed below). I'm glad you are concerned about this, but you would do much better to take a training class covering weapon retention and recovery.

Reasons:

* Hand to hand grappling. If you have a non-breakaway rope/chain/lanyard you just gave me much more of an advantage over you. This item will serve to restrict your range motion and place an artificial boundary on your escape path. If it is a breakaway then it is a pointless distraction.

* If I grab the lanyard I fundamentally control whatever it is attached to, including your sidearm.

* I may be able to use it to choke you depending on length. If it long enough for you to draw and present it is may be long enough to get around your neck.

* Your sidearm actually becomes an encumbrance. What if you have a non-clearable jam, or you are wrestling with your assailant? Your sidearm normally acts as a blunt object force multiplier. With a lanyard or retention strap/cable this option is restricted or removed entirely.

* It is a distraction for you. What if it gets hung up in your cover garment when you draw? Now you are trying to clear your garment from the obstruction. At best in this scenario you have a portion of your FOV obstructed, at worst you have a tangle you have to fix.

* You are prevented from giving your firearm to another individual in any scenario. In addition if you lose control and drop the firearm during a struggle, you have a hot gun swinging around wildly. 

In the good idea/bad idea category I would put this squarely in the bad idea category. :)

Basically his range is the animation of the shotgun, so if you are hugging them or they are outside of the animation, chances are you are not going to hit them. It takes practice but It should be used as a finishing tool or a scare tactic rather than your main weapon. Focus on the airstrike/assault rifle and use it to keep the space, as sniper+airstrike Ted can hold lines early game all by himself. Keep knockback in reserve as you don't know if you actually need it (basically to kill the floaty characters like Ayla or Vinnie). Use sniper to poke and finish from long distances.

AdamColligan,askscience,1391191458.0,"A couple of extra contributions:

One thing to point out is that the Constitution does not fix the number of Supreme Court justices at nine. So the check that the other branches have in terms of changing the composition of the court is not limited to impeaching justices: it is also possible for the other two branches to *add* justices, something that [FDR once threatened to do](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/about/history/CourtPacking.cfm).

I want to disagree with most of the posters here that the Supreme Court's inability to ""enforce"" rulings is really a check on its power in the classic sense of ""checks and balances"".  Under the Constitution, the nation's authorities are vested in and through law, and the Supreme Court is the arbiter of what that law means in practice when it is disputed. Their practical inability to enforce rulings seems generally to be rooted in the fact that the command structure of the guys with guns flows mostly to the President and somewhat to Congress, with little infrastructure connecting it to the Article III courts. That doesn't change the fact that if the Supreme Court enjoins the President from doing something unconstitutional, he *is* legally prohibited from doing it and is supposed to be loyal to the constitution as set out in his oath. If he or she refuses to stop doing X, and the soldiers and/or bureaucrats who were carrying out X decide to listen to the President rather than to the Constitution (as clarified by the Court), that is a practical check on the Court's power, but I wouldn't call it a legitimate legal or constitutional check on the Court's power. You could say that Congress could then impeach the President, and that's true. But if you're already down that road, the President could just ask the executive branch personnel not to recognize the impeachment vote the same way they just chose not to recognize the Court's decision. People may take more seriously the power of Congress to rule on the legitimacy of the authority of a person in the Oval Office (by saying: ""You're impeached! You can't order those soldiers/bureaucrats to do that thing!""), and they may take less seriously the power of the Court to rule on the legitimacy of the same order (by saying: ""You may be the President, but that doesn't give you the power to order those soldiers/bureaucrats to do that thing! It's unconstitutional!""). But that strikes me as a cultural issue, not a legal one.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391191478.0,"&gt; First off, ""redistribute"" is a misnomer. On a free market, wealth isn't distributed by some central authority, it is appropriated and produced. You keep what you produce until you voluntarily forfeit ownership of it. There is no ""production phase"" and ""distribution phase"" because, in a free market, they are one and the same. There is no “assumed distribution” on the free market separate from the voluntary activities of every individual’s production and exchange. The only given on the free market is the property right of every man in his own person and in the resources which he finds, produces, or creates, or which he obtains in voluntary exchange for his products or as a gift from their producers. Only the state, who does not produce wealth itself but rather uses its monopoly of force to take from some and give to other, has a ""production phase"" (as done by the free market) and separate ""distribution phase"" (which it gives to those favored members of society it wishes to bribe and, of course, to itself).

So products aren't made in factories and then sold at a separate time in a different facility often in a different part of the world?

Also, yes, the government sometimes redistributes wealth by taking from some and giving to others. 

Lemme ask you something. Whose face is on the money taken from you? Seems to be various presidents' faces and the occasional nonpresidential icon like Ben Franklin. Render unto Caesar's which is Caesar's. Even Jesus understood this 2000 years ago. 

Beyond that, I see the government as ""correcting"" the market where it needs correction.

&gt;Secondly, the economic fallacy you are citing was destroyed hundreds of years ago when it was originally introduced by the Luddites, and it has long since been destroyed. Machines took yer jerb, and you're all pissed about the progress of civilization and technology because you think machines are replacing man because if we increase how much a person can produce, then the jobs producing that aren't needed anymore. If you were right about this, man would have run out of jobs long ago. This misunderstanding stems from gross economic ignorance though.

Oh, what jobs are gonna replace the 47% of jobs, which are disproportionately low skilled, that are going to be automated within the next two decades? I can't think of anything except for a smaller number of jobs that will likely require a college degree or years of acquired skills just to do.

&gt;But that's not all, because when technology makes your business more efficient then it was before, it increases your profits by reducing your costs of production, and the grocery store that has seen this increase from profits will do one of the following with their new profits: expand their operations, lower their prices, and/or spend their money elsewhere. If they expand their operations, they will hire more people, meaning more jobs, as well as meaning that more goods are produced that now may be enjoyed by all. 

A lot of those jobs are overseas in sweatshops, also, many of them are becoming increasingly automated as well. And how is anyone gonna have money in their pocket if they can't get a job and you're against redistribution?

&gt;Things like the 40 hour work week and weekends are not the creations of labor unions.

Are you living in an alternate reality from me?

&gt;Markets aren't a ""power relationship"". Only when one is using coercion does the idea of ""power relation"" make sense as you must suck up to those that hold this coercive power over you, and only someone who can think of no other way to deal with their other men then to use violence to degrade them to the rank of cattle and control them thinks that because they relate to people this way, everyone else must relate in this same way as well. With markets, no one holds such power over you. No coercion may be initiated against your person and property, and the only limitations upon your own action is to not murder, enslave, or rob your fellow men, respecting their equal rights. This is the true system of economic harmony. Violent and fraudulent con-men only introduce chaos.

Someone exercising power over you in dictating what you do with your time IS a power relationship. Being able to sanction you by taking away your livelihood IS a power relationship. Capitalism IS a power relationship betwen worker and boss. It just creates an illusion of more freedom.

In comes a surprise kid. If they go through with it, they have to drop out of school, either get married or consciously not get married (in either case, they could break up)... The three of them will be a family living shitty lives. The best case scenario is that the mother carries the young child to term while in school, and then gives the baby up for adoption, or something like that. Is that so great?

I'm not saying it's worse for the child than if the child lives. But it's not that great for the child, and it takes a lot out of the mother, and of the mother and the father's relationship.

If they get an abortion, they can continue through school, and continue their relationship, without that pressure. They can go on to live their dream life, and have children who are loved and cared for.

I'm not saying that an unborn child is not a person, and that its life is not entitled to respect. But the person is unborn, and until birth, it seems to me, the value of a life is less than the overriding and in some sense infinite value of a full life. If you don't agree -- if you simply feel that killing a zygote is as bad as killing a one year old, then certainly, the scenario before us is euthanasia without consent--and that's got to be a tough sell, and one I wouldn't make.

You need to eat at a surplus. Doesn't matter how cheap it is (and I'm  positive you can afford it if you've had money for personal trainers and nutritionists).  If you don't eat at a surplus, you could lift endlessly and never gain weight. Believe me, you aren't the first person who has had trouble with this.

&gt; AC takes humidity out of the air. Even the AC in your home does this, its a result of how they work. The AC comes on to help dry up all the moisture inside your car. If you're trying to get ice and snow melted off the outside, buy a brush and scraper and clean it off manually.
&gt; 

Wow. I have been driving in Wisconsin and Iowa and the Midwest generally for 25 years, and I have *never once* considered buying an ice scraping device. That's genius. So, you're saying that there are tools that I would use, from outside the vehicle, to actually physically forcefully *scrape* the ice off my windshield. Okay, gotcha. And then you're saying that, as I am driving down the interstate and the slush is flying up and freezing on the windshield and the sleet is continuing to come down and is freezing on the windshield, that I should continue to climb out of my vehicle every mile and re-scrape? That I should do this *instead of* directing hot air at my windshield?

That's pure genius.

(Note that I would not have employed sarcasm had this very same exact issue not already been discussed here.)

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Although it would be nice to have warm air on your face, heat rises and by putting heat out the floor while you're defrosting (probably right after you start your cold car up) your car will warm up much faster.
&gt; 

Riiiiight. So my *personal preference* to have warm air blowing on my face and hands, and the fact that my feet almost never feel cold, is of absolutely no value to how I'd like warm air being blown in my own car. You're saying that my discomfort when driving due to my *torso* being cold, not my legs, is something I shouldn't consider, because physics. 

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Automotive engineers are smart people. They didn't just forget the option of defrost and vent. I think its ultimately about it not being needed and would be considered a luxury that no one would really notice or care about.

But clearly it has been noticed, and cared about.

Furthermore, to say that someone has a particular job and therefore they are 'smart' is not to say that they have practical knowledge, or that they have therefore considered everything. Nothing against engineers, this goes for everyone. And my question here was to try to figure out WHY this was how so many cars have been designed this way.

YOUR claim is that they have actually considered desires like mine, and dismissed them. Do you have evidence for that?"

WastingPaint,relationships,1391191641.0,"Hello, my doppelganger!!

So, the main piece of advice that people always told me was, ""why don't you find a nice, smart boy at your school to date?""
The problem with that is, at least at my school (which always, always, *always* tops the list of ""colleges with the most stressed out students"" and, if you're in a top 10 school as well, I can't imagine it being any different) that people are rarely *looking* for relationships when everyone is taking insanely difficult classes/working/volunteering/curing cancer, so that's not the best advice to receive. I'm like you, I like relationships and I find them manageable even with a hectic schedule because hey, nothing's more stress relieving after a long day than a cuddle sesh. Guys tend to be less in that mindset than girls.

For reference, I dated people who were valedictorians and barely passing and I found both to be very difficult. The brilliantly smart ones were arrogant as fuck and belittled me for having, say, a 3.7 as opposed to their 3.9. The less motivated ones frustrated me to no end with their laziness. Your boyfriend is definitely in the low end of the spectrum. Think long-term: if you get married, how would he be able to provide/contribute? Would you want to be picking up after your SO for the rest of your life?

I had to step outside of my college to find the balance I needed because I sure as hell wasn't going to find that in my school and I'm very happy I did. My current SO is the perfect middle of the road -- definitely not overly ambitious but is in grad school for HR management. He always tells me that I motivate him because he wants to be able to have a good job and provide a good life for us together, and to this day that's one of the best compliments I've ever received. So it's up to you to make that choice, but never feel like you have to settle for someone like that! 

Hope this helps!!"

It's fun, and we don't actually have to do any math any more - we can just outline the form we want the formula to take, add another formula in the middle, because fuckit, why not, shift all the baggage out of the way with some cleverly used parantheses, and we end up with an elegant solution.

catgundam,digimon,1391191911.0,"One of my biggest gripes with 02 was how attention-focused it was on Daisuke (and by extension Ken, being his jogress partner and all that) despite the fact that he's just... a shallow character compared to Taichi and isn't really deserving of everything that he's rewarded with. Daisuke did nothing special or ""courageous"" to earn his first digimental. And I mean, okay, he's the leader and Digimon logic generally dictates that the leader will get at least one more evo beyond the rest of the group (not that I agree with it; it was such a big problem in Frontier that it blew me away). But Imperialdramon was *so* overpowered compared to the rest to the point where nearly everyone else is irrelevant, gets *two* modes on top of the extra evolution, and is constantly in the spotlight and is the star of the show.

Don't even get me on his role in the Revenge of Diablomon movie when he overshadowed even Omegamon with a *third* goddamn mode. Why be better than Omegamon? Why not fight together or have equal roles in some way instead of taking his sword? I mean, I guess I understand wanting to introduce a new mode for the main character with a movie, much like Our War Game, but having it be at Omegamon's expense (needing his sword after he had been defeated) was just... ugh. It could have been written differently.

Daisuke is just too flat of a character to be rewarded with so much. I don't mind the Adventure characters being more in the background since they had their season to shine, but to make Daisuke so much more powerful than Taichi--who is actually a good character--makes me frown. I've been told that it's not really fair to compare him to Taichi so much, but meh. I'm not asking for a carbon copy of Taichi, just a character that is worthy of being his successor. And that's what Daisuke is not.

Another thing that bugged me about 02: How weird they get about enemy Digimon dying. It's been a while since I've seen Adventure, but I don't remember them giving much of a fuck about killing off villains. Meanwhile Miyako loses her shit when they had to kill off LadyDevimon (who will be reborn in Primary Village anyway) despite that Miyako herself would have LITERALLY died if they didn't. And Iori throwing a fit over killing off MarineDevimon even though he was attacking a hospital full of dying kids. I just... I don't understand.

And like, this is just scratching the surface of all the things I didn't like about 02. Why, 02, why did you have to be such a shitwreck? It's actually genuinely upsetting."

The smaller little bumps before those spikes are the atria contracting, which are the smaller top chambers of the heart that fill up before having the blood pulled out of them by the ventricles. The big bump after the spikes are the ventricles relaxing to prepare to contract for the next beat. On a normal EKG, you will see the little bump, followed shortly by the tall spike, followed shortly by the big bump. In a healthy heart, this sequence will be followed beat after beat. From OP's comments, it seems he requires an electronic pacemaker to get his heart to beat in the correct sequence. The section of this EKG just showing squiggly lines and little bumps represent a length of time in which OP's pacemaker was being switched out, so his ventricles were not pumping blood.

However, there is one evening that I will always remember. I got a call on a Saturday night to a Marriott hotel. Nothing special, just a pizza and breadsticks for some random room. When I got to the door I heard young women laughing inside. I knock on the door and a young (and attractive) woman opens it with just her head peeking out.

She tells me to come in real quick while she gets the money. Normally drivers are apprehensive of walking into a strangers home/hotel room, but I am a *very* large and strong man so I decided to risk it.

As she opens the door more she turns around and I see that she isn't wearing a single article of clothing. Not only that but there are *two* other young and attractive women in the room as well. The two ladies were *drying each other off with towels*. It seems they must have all just got back from the pool.

I wasn't able to do much but stare with my mouth agape. The woman who answered the door gave me $15 (I don't remember the total but it would have only come out to a $1 tip or something like that). She pouted her lips and said, ""I'm afraid I don't have any more cash to offer you. Oh wait! I know!""

She then proceeded to jump on the bed so she was around my height, then rubbed her breasts in my face for a good 15 seconds, kissed me on the cheek and wished me a good evening. Needless to say, I was okay with the $1 tip after that.

Seriously.

The exposure that CAR gets in at least the English speaking press is minimal. CAR exemplifies the notion that ""no one cares about Africa.""

When President Bozizé was overthrown by Seleka, and those 10 South African troops were killed, I thought surely this would change. It didn't. 

Now, with the recent violence and atrocities, I've been dismayed to find that even a crisis such as this has not really changed that sad state of affairs. But journalists like you are changing that. So seriously - thank you for doing this and giving that troubled country some much deserved exposure.

My question is: I assume (or hope) that in Bangui at least there is at least a sizable number of people who want nothing to to with either Seleka or the anti-Balaka, whatever their religion. People who disapprove of the violence. Among those people, is there a general perception of which side has been more brutal, more atrocious? Or is it generally seen that both sides have stooped to tragic lows?"

Blacksheep01,dogecoin,1391192254.0,"Because of the amount of Doge available, I think the best case scenario for Doge (even decades into the future) is that it ends up being worth $1 per Doge, a pure 1 to 1 transaction. Most people can understand this and considering most people are not wealthy nor do they understand how .000001 BTC is worth anything, a 1 to 1 fiat to crypto conversion seems the most likely path to mass scale adoption of cryptocurrency. 

A month ago I thought Doge was just a well placed joke, but people are using it, talking about it and loving it. And honestly, currency only has value with mass scale adoption and Doge is going that way, likely due to the cheapness of the coins and fun nature of the meme. At this point BTC is looking like a long term investment coin utilized by financial brokerages as a bond/stock substitute and Doge might just well be the actual currency replacement. 

Your average person does not understand that .01 BTC has value, it just looks like you paid $10 for a penny (something about human mental makeup desires most to have whole rather than part). But people love having 10,000 whole doges for $15 and as I noted, they'd easily understand and keep using 1 doge at .50 cents or 1 doge for $1. Want to send money to family in another country? Just do the ol' 1 to 1 doge conversion. Want to buy something from a foreign business? 1 to 1 doge, simple and easy. 

I feel like a lunatic still for imagining that Doge might actual be used as day to day currency, but hey, usage is getting there, it's getting rather high profile with all the Olympic stuff and it's fun and lighthearted. No noobs are getting screamed at for questioning how Doge works and people flip 200 doge tips for the hell of it.

First off. If you don't need a phone RIGHT NOW, wait. Samsung will be announcing the S5 in March which will cause the S4's price to dive.

If you absolutely must have a phone now, keep reading:

Now, avoid all of the specs that don't matter. The primary one of these is the number of cores. Any sufficiently recent dual-core plus phone will do fine over the next 2 years.

First thing to consider is size. No matter how nice a phone is, if you can't use it well, it's useless. The size of your hands doesn't matter, either. Some people have no problem using a phone 2-handed, but they still might not want a giant 5"" (or 6.3"" in the case of the Note) mega-phone.

Next, stay away from variants of existing models. Samsung is particularly bad about doing this.

Good - Samsung Galaxy S4.

Bad - Samsung Galaxy S4 mini.

Good - Samsung Galaxy Note (2 or 3).

Bad - Samsung Galaxy Grand/Mega (same chassis as the note, completely different screen).

The top contenders right now (available on Verizon):

* Galaxy S4 - Beautiful 1080p (AMOLED) screen. Great camera. Plenty of horsepower for 2 years+.
* HTC One - Beautiful 1080p (IPS LCD) screen. Excellent low-light camera, but lacking in the MP department). Plenty of horsepower for 2 years+.
* Motorola MotoX - Customizable color schemes via the Motomaker site, excellent 720p (AMOLED) screen. Active notifications. Excellent voice controls. Nearly pure Android experience. Main processor is ""only"" dual-core, but so far easily keeps up with my S4. May get cranky toward the end of 2 years, but nobody knows for sure, as 4.4 uses a lot less resources than 4.3.
* Motorola Maxx - Same guts as the MotoX, but with a slightly larger screen and a OMFGHUGE battery. Generally the same nearly pure Android experience.

I'm being mostly objective when I say that these 4 are the only phones worth getting on Verizon if you have to get a phone right now.

Anything with mega, mini, max (with the exception of the Moto Maxx), grand, etc around the name should be avoided. They might be fine now, but software updates are much more problematic due to low volumes."

&gt;Metabolically healthy obesity isn’t common. And it may not be permanent, warns Dr. Hu. Just because a person has metabolically healthy obesity at one point doesn’t it will stay that way. With aging, a slowdown in exercise, or other changes, metabolically healthy obesity can morph into its harmful counterpart.

&gt;It’s also important to keep in mind that obesity can harm more than just metabolism. Excess weight can damage knee and hip joints, lead to sleep apnea and respiratory problems, and contributes to the development of several cancers.

&gt;Bottom line? Obesity isn’t good, even if it’s the metabolically healthy kind."

sitapixie1,AskWomen,1391192508.0,"I've never really had ""long hair"". The longest I've had it was just a smidge past my shoulders. The shortest is when I've shaved it. I've had tons of different styles too: mohawk, pixie cut (hair cut from 11th grade till about 25), bobs, inverted bobs.

When I had my hair on the longish side (just brushing my shoulders), I liked it for awhile but then just got so sick of it. Having to fix it all the time, having the hair get tangled up, getting stuck in my jacket or under my backpack straps, and having it in my face. Blech. It just was too time consuming and fussy.

Just recently chopped most of it off and I love it. Ever since I got it cut, I wonder why I stuck with my ""long hair phase"" for so long. Here's a picture that's similar to my cut. It's really low maintenance. Also if the bangs bug me, I can clip them back. I'm probably going to keep this style for a bit and not grow it out for a long time (if ever)...did I mention I love having short hair again? :D

http://pixie-haircut.tumblr.com/post/54848099387

The main thing I find ""fussy/high maintenance"" with my short hair is that my hair is really thick and grows fast. I need to get it cut about ever 2 months or so or it really starts looking a bit too chunky.

If you are worried about getting too short or too drastic of a change you can just slowly start cutting it shorter to get an idea of how it will look or how you will like it. 


Edited to add more details above and this: everyone is right though about trying to grow it out from a pixie cut. It's a pain in the ass and takes for ever. Also, you'll hit this awkward stage when it's between just past your ears to just past your chin and will want to wear a hat everyday cause you can't do anything with it.

More of a dimly lit, smoky, small bar feel than Corona, although Corona is also excellent from what I hear. Hell, they're in walking distance of each other, you've got options. 

If you are looking for a liquor store, Total Wine and More has the best selection in town. 

And although this is a Bourbon sub, if you are a beer fan, I highly recommend World of Beer for the best beer selection I've ever seen or Redlight Redlight for more of a younger crowd if that's what you are looking for.

They had started the account while married, and the divorce agreement required that he continue to contribute to it at a minimum rate and then pay out for a minimum of four years.

It wound up really fucking both of us, grant speaking, because our expecting parental contribution level on federal aid forms was five times higher than it actually wound up being and we *had to* claim his income, which was 6-figures, rather than my mother's, which was near-poverty-line.

grizz281,ultimate,1391192698.0,"Well then likewise, I don't think that single leg work is the be-all end-all solution to deficiencies in ultimate players either. And honestly, I feel that pivoting is a relatively small portion of the game for a lot of players, especially newer ones who aren't going to be handling a lot. So, couldn't we approach training for them in the same way we approach training for say, a cornerback or a soccer player? There will be a lot of running and cutting (to both sides) so wouldn't a bilateral approach be more efficient? Furthermore, wouldn't unilateral work slow down the development of strength since adding weight comes at a much slower rate than for squats? This might be detrimental for the athlete not only physically, but psychologically as well because it might be possible that they only added 5 pounds to their skater squats in 3 weeks. 

Also, I don't think training with an imbalance will magnify the imbalance. The other leg is still doing work, it's just at a relative deficit compared to the stronger leg (say, a 55-45 strength ratio). So the other leg is still getting stronger, just not as strong as the dominant leg."

It would suck to lose her forever this way, of course, no doubt. But I can't imagine a heaven where people are there against their will, where they are made to feel like they are fed (in their opinion) bullshit for eternity.

Rerichael,gainit,1391192767.0,"Personally, I think you're better off not bothering. Not because of your living scenario, but because it sounds like you don't have the dedication. You're looking for a miracle cure. It doesn't exist. Hard work and persistence are the solution.

Have you seen a doctor about getting stomach aches from eating anything before noon? That doesn't sound all too normal. Also, you and your girlfriend can absolutely eat the same thing with different goals, because weight gain/loss is all about calories. You eat the same stuff, you just have to eat more than her.

There's plenty of lactose intolerant gainers in the world, so that won't be an issue. Excessive amounts constitute what? Eat a banana or two a day and you'll be alright. Good source of Calories.

Have you been told by a doctor that you shouldn't do leg based exercise? or have you self-prescribed this? If you've seen a doctor on it, then I'm sorry. It's tough luck. If you haven't seen a doc, go see a doc. S/he will tell you what you can or can't do. Leg exercises can actually help with knee pain, if done correctly.

Your last paragraph strikes me as a problem that I, along with a lot of gainers, have had in the past. We think we eat a lot, but we really only eat a lot once a day. Instead of eating 2 chipotle burritos at once, try splitting it into a bunch of smaller meals throughout the day. Higher calories, and you don't get that too full feeling you said you got.

Also, You're looking at it in a linear sense. ""All this chicken and lifting and I'm only gaining six pounds?"" Yes, that is about average for gain of muscle. Now you can absolutely gain fat, but your opening paragraph says you want to gain muscle. 

I'm not trying to put you off the idea of gaining. In fact, I invite you to begin and I would love to see your progress, but you need to get the idea that you're ""different"" and ""special"" out of your head. There's plenty of people, even on this sub, who have much more complications to deal with than what you've listed, and they've been very successful with their gaining endeavors.

If you're serious about doing this, read the FAQ, and go see a doctor. 

Gaining is really just 4 steps.
1. Eat Big
2. Lift Big
3. Sleep Big
4. Get Big

Best of luck"

wordserious,AskReddit,1391192785.0,"Well, to each his or her own. I've been married 10 years, though, and from where I'm sitting, the wedding is a distant memory. Yeah, it was a wonderful day, but it was one day. After that came good and bad things and many, many challenges. Moving and getting pay cuts, having a child, buying a house, taking vacations, being promoted, buying and selling more cars than I can count, dealing with health problems and hospital stays, having to step up to help family members, going back to school, and right now starting to think about retirement, college fund for the kid, healthcare when we're older, you get the picture.

It is tempting to say (pardon my language) YOLO and have an awesome party, but I suggest that getting married is the moment in your life when you stop living exclusively for yourself and start doing it with/for somebody else. This is the time to start making plans and thinking about the future.

I am not saying don't have a party. I am just saying, do something within your reach and that will not impact your financial future. It is hard enough to get started in life, without dealing with debt and/or lack of money. I don't know what your position in life is, but there are very few things that stress a marriage as much as not having enough money.

sockalicious,AdviceAnimals,1391193031.0,"When you are physically alone and thinking of your friends and loved ones: they still aren't there.  The comfort you take in these thoughts is an illusion produced by your brain.  

You rely on properties of your loved one's own brains - memories of fondness, fellow-feelings, love - when you predict that they will be pleased to see you again at your next encounter.  These brain properties are fragile, generated by proteins moving around in electrical cells called neurons - and they can be destroyed by head traumas, strokes, brain tumors, surgical operations.  Drugs can alter or destroy them.

Your friends and loved ones are just protein buckets and when you are alone you desperately cling to what you perceive as their love; a certain arrangement of proteins, mostly in their temporal and frontal lobes, that causes them to act a certain way.

And then there's CJ20PPG, who's gone from stopgap to a good bench piece.

We can tank and try to get the Big Three, and if we don't get that, we can always look for someone like Kevin Love or expand our bounty of draft picks. This team's future looks bright, and even though we're doing dreadful, going to a Celtics game isn't a waste of time. If you think that this team isn't fun to watch because they're losing, then you might as well jump on the Heat bandwagon. "

**With Elo System** He currently has the highest mmr on the team and that's why he is first pick. The elo system would accurately show that he is ""better"" than his teammembers because it displays mmr. 

**With League System**
Even though he is ""better"" than his teammates the league system shows that he is only diamond 3 while his teammates are challenger. The league system inaccurately displays that his teammates are ""better"". He will need to play a lot more games until he eventually reaches Challenger 400+lp. 

That's why I prefer the elo system.

This thing about cluttering up the visual space with shitty handstyles is nothing new or alien to me - I'm from LA.

slockley,WritingPrompts,1391193328.0,"Mark's hands were shaking, and it was hard to calculate in his head.  Based on the man's suit, he probably had a higher income than Mark had previously estimated.  Could Mark afford the murder fee?  He had to decide in seconds, or the man would be out of the alley and into the crowded street, where Mark had much less of a chance to finish the job.

*$250k, maybe.  Divided by life expectancy, times the federal rate...*

Mark held perfectly still as the man approached, trying to hold the numbers in his head.

It had not been long since Murder had been legalized in Louisiana, and Mark knew that the most profitable time to take advantage was early, before the market had stabilized.  The fees were generally reasonable, and the market for hits were still quite high.  In a year, the margins for murder would make it barely profitable at all.

*Get in, get paid, then move out of town.*  This had been the plan since the day Suzanne died.  And Mark had successfully implemented this plan in Vermont, Florida, Colorado, and now here in one of the last states to accept the inevitable law that Civil Rights advocates had enacted countrywide.  He would hopefully retire after a few more months in New Orleans, and begin to build his life.

California was the second state to legalize it, and only hours after Massachusetts did first.  Mark had even signed the petition outside a Vons grocery store, mostly because the nice man with the clipboard would make $6 a signature, and because he thought the law would never pass Legal review.

But since *Weltzer v. the State of California* was ignored by the Supreme Court, and the appellate court's decision held that there was no way to determine when human life began, civil rights activists moved quickly.  What was once a debate about women's rights and fetuses quickly became about the value of life itself.

Public opinion, legislation and judicial decision swayed at a blistering pace toward the idea that the value of life is not inherent, but *earned.*

After all, people's right to control their bodies ended only when they took from others, and if a fetus actually cost the mother money, then she was well justified in removing it from existence.  And if there was no legally valid difference between a fetus and a child, then the same applied to them.  Soon, the enlightened realized that there was no hard difference between a child and an adult, so the accepted murder age rose and rose.

California changed dramatically in those first months.  But more significantly, Mark's world changed the day Suzanne was shot by her cousin Leo, because it suited his financial portfolio to remove her from her place of employment.  The fee was only a few thousand dollars, which Leo quickly earned back by taking her position in management.

Mark had thought the paperwork for killing Leo would be more difficult than it was.  *Finally, a government program that runs efficiently,* Mark would tell himself while filling out an online form and paying the fee automatically from his digital wallet.

His first murder was for revenge, but soon he was realizing the profitability of correctly chosen murder-recipients.  The fee was nominal, and occasionally steep, but if business can profit from the change caused by it, it could bean efficient way to make a buck.

And Mark had made a lot of cash in the last 5 years.

*He can't be making more than $300k, and I can probably swing it.*  The man was steps away from the place Mark had planned to spring out to, from behind the dumpster.  Mark held his breath and counted steps.  3, 2, 1...

---

Mark had been able to afford the fee for killing the man, who he now knew was Steven Lind, a key corporate lawyer involved in a case against Mark's business.  The surviving lawyers quickly dropped the charges, and Mark had completed the business deal that would allow him to retire.

As Mark boarded the airplane to Panama, he looked back at the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport one last time.  America had turned into a nightmare.  The politicians said they weren't *for* murder, but simply supported people's rights to choose.  Mark was not convinced.  The ease by which he took other's lives for his own gain somehow seemed wrong, though he couldn't figure out quite how.

Mark never noticed his assassin, who had been sitting in seat 2D.

As the floor rushed up to impact Mark's now limp body, he tried to speak, though his punctured lungs would no longer inflate.  *First class, huh?  Nice.*"

feedmahfish,askscience,1391193372.0,"Just to add on, because this is pretty clear cut.

One thing I keep in mind with species is that it's a utility word.

A utility word is something I use to describe words that have no set-in-stone definitions, but are defined by the context.  Which makes these words, in my opinion, more useful across disciplines.

My field is fisheries and we use all of the species concepts, and that's perfectly fine.  When it comes to management plans, we set the definition according to the context of the plan.  For example, if we say we wish to conserve Species A, and we know that species A is split into multiple subspecies, we may wish to say, for the purpose of this plan, that Species A includes all subspecies in the species complex, which ultimately weakens this idea that those subspecies are even subspecies at all (this is actually an immediate conflict between the phylogenetic and biological species concepts).

But that's fine.  We used the phylogenetic concept in this case as many subspecies are still capable of intergrading if the geographical barriers are removed or opportunity arises.  And thus we can manage for the species and subspecies as one taxon: the species.

Other utility words arise in different fields and they have great uses, such as my favorite word, ""stock"".  A stock can be thought of as a population of animals, a population of harvestable animals, a population of distinct genetic structure, a geographically isolated population, a sub-population, etc.  Again, the same idea, we define it according to the context of the word.

So, in my opinion, species is a great word to use, as long as you define it appropriately within the context!"

TheEquivocator,xxfitness,1391193436.0,"Well, I'm just saying how I personally feel about it. If she's said ""no thanks"" explicitly and not taken it back explicitly, I don't feel I have the right to presume that things I might read into her actions override what she's told me explicitly. Perhaps I might *hope* that she was just playing hard to get, and send her a text just in case, but I wouldn't presume to think of her as a bitch because of assumptions that *I'd* made.

I mean, just based on the responses in this thread, it looks like you're right that it's bad policy to give out numbers to guys you're not interested in. But honestly, until this point, I'd have considered the shoe on the other foot: she's told me she's not interested, so really it's bad form for me to be pressing her for her number. But I do it anyway, so she gives it to me—I'd think of that as unnecessary politeness in giving me what I am pressing for (her number), despite the fact that she's already warned me this won't go anywhere. But I guess that's just me."
Russian_Surrender,AskMen,1391193446.0,"Yes, and I made a mistake about it.

Going back to highschool days, so it may not be real relevant.  I was good friends with a girl, but she was never ""my type"".  I go for petite and she was tall and ""big boned"", but not chubby.  Just not the type of girl I was interested in.

But intellectually, we were similar.  We were both smart, but fucked off in school so still got good grades, but not what we could have.  Had similar interests, etc.

After 2 years of being really good friends, she made a move on me and we kissed.  It was a memorably good kiss even 25 years later.  Likely the most memorable kiss I've had.

Looking back, I think I kind of had the attitude of ""Wow!  She's really lucky I reciprocated that kiss, because she's really not my type at all"".  For all I know, she may have been thinking the same thing as me.  But the reality was, that despite not physically meeting my mold, she really *was* my type intellectually.  I just didn't realize at the time that that's what I was feeling.

I wasn't a dick about things at all, but after the kiss, I just kind of assumed that we'd end up being in a relationship.  That's where things went off the rails.  She was thinking more along the lines of ""that was a nice kiss"" and leaving it at that.  It resulted in a lot of confusion between us and the relationship was never the same."
Conquestador,truegaming,1391193448.0,"I still think that the UI isn't *bad*, strictly (except for certain interfaces, like labors and military). It's very roguelike - obtuse.

It's certainly unintuitive, but the fact that a broken-in player can do the things they need to quickly and easily (mostly) means it's not *bad*, because it does what it sets out to do.

It would have been a great catch for the cops if they'd managed to actually get any evidence against me, but hell, they hadn't even found my kill room. It was there for anyone to find. All they had to do was look deeper in my apartment, but no, they missed it.

IRS filings come in ""Forms,"" like the 1040 that is the Federal income tax return; each form has an accompanying ""Instructions"" document that explains how to use it. All are available as PDF.  The government takes incredible pains in order that the publications and instructional documents be intelligible to the average English-speaking taxpayer.   If you can stand to wade through the instructions, your understanding will start to increase very quickly.

&gt; The difference in taxation, filing obligations for regular employees and independent contractors. If any.

I'll take this on.  Employers have to get a W-4 and I-9 on file for a regular employee.  When they issue paychecks, a variety of monies have to be 'withheld' from those paychecks; that money has to be sent to the appropriate taxing agency.  There are detailed tables explaining how much needs to be withheld, but in reality it is far too complicated to do by hand and it is done by computers these days.  Common withholdings include estimated Federal income tax, estimated State income tax, FICA (which is Social Security and Medicare), federal Unemployment tax, and often a variety of state disability-insurance-fund and unemployment taxes.  After the end of the year, a W-2 form must be issued to the employee by the employer, showing how much wages were paid that year and how much of each kind of withhold was withheld; at the same time, a W-3 form goes to the IRS, showing the same information.

An independent contractor gets paid by an employer, but the employer need not withhold anything.  The contractor himself/herself is supposed to send in timely estimated tax payments and FICA direct to the taxing authorities (the meaning of ""timely"" is different for different contractors, I believe.)  After the end of the year, the contractor receives form 1099 from the employer, showing how much money was paid to the contractor.  At the same time, the employer sends form 1096 to the IRS with the same information.

After forms 1099 and/or W-2 are received by the employee/contractor, they are included as part of form 1040, the tax ""return"" that the employee/contractor ""returns"" to the IRS with a calculation of what they believe their true tax liability for the year ought to have been.  The difference between what was withheld and what the taxpayer truly owes is either a positive or negative number; if the employer withheld too much, the IRS sends it back to the taxpayer, and in the opposite case, the taxpayer must send additional money to the IRS.

This is oversimplified - there are lots of different form 1099s; you don't always have to submit a 1099; the W-2 is far more complicated than I let on above; I didn't touch on what the difference is between an employee and IC; but it is a start.

&gt; What type of professionals should I contact once my taxes get complicated?

If they are complicated enough, a CPA (certified public accountant) is the kind of pro who usually deals with this.  Mine charges $350 an hour and is a real pro; most people don't need this level of tax assistance or advice.

The other certification that might be found in tax prep is EA (enrolled agent).  While the CPA's duty is to his client, the EA's duty is to the IRS.  In most cases this is no big deal because the client and the IRS both have an identical interest in making sure taxes are done correctly.  However, if there is a difference in interpretation of the tax code, an audit, or another conflict, the EA cannot represent you."

* Lee Stafford's ""Breaking Hair"" treatment is 12 bucks and amazing.  I would highly recommend looking into this.  A lot of hair thinning is as a result of split ends. 

* Biotin and Folic Acid can be found in the vitamin section of a grocery store.  Take one of each a day.

* Wear your hair in a bun on top of your head when you go to sleep.  Our hair takes a beating when it rubs against our pillows all night long.

* When you blow dry, dry your hair at its roots in an upward direction or by hanging your head upside-down.  This will increase the amount of volume your hair has and make it appear thicker.

* When straightening, straighten at the roots in an upward direction and let it cool by draping it over the opposite side of your head.  Similar to blow drying, this will also increase volume and make it appear thicker.

**EDIT:** And if you're impatient like me, buy some clip-in hair extensions.  They're only about 60 bucks if you get them from sundance or a similar store on Amazon.

Skulder,AskReddit,1391193707.0,"Denmark: 

I have to say, there's no government mandated minimum wage, but the unions are pretty strong, and the de facto minimum wage is ~110 kroner -&gt; $22

Living wage is a relatively new concept, and I don't think anyone has calculated it for Denmark. However:

The average wage (2012) was 290kr -&gt; $58

The poverty line is 103.200 a year -&gt; $20,640

I guess that ratio tells you something too.

----

One reason we do not have a government mandated living wage, is that as we live relatively close to other countries, there's a fear that countries will try to undercut each other, to get more industry etc.

Imagine, for example, if each state could set their own minimum wage, how they would compete, and how it would turn into a race to the bottom.

Another reason is that since our national intelligence agencies were never as successful as yours in sabotaging the unions (they smell a bit like communism, you know), the minimum wage in different fields have stayed at reasonable levels (mostly).

----

If another Dane passes by, please post corrections or suggestions as needed. I don't think there are any glaring errors or omissions, but I'd rather be embarrassed than be wrong."

In Blighttown, there's only one way forward for most new players. You hit a wall, you fight through it. Get stuck in New Londo and you can just turn back and try another area.

Building Sunfire is also probably subpar when you consider his kit. If you want waveclear, Tiamat into Hydra is better on every front, and a Randuin's is a better solution to your Armor/Health needs.

Sunfire is better on people who have moderate to high waveclear built into their kit, to accent their pushing (See Mundo, Shyvana or Renekton). Gangplank is NOT one of these champions. He's a late game duellist with a boatload of free stats. Anyone with free AD and on-hit procs is better served by Tiamat's splash, and Randuin's is in every category a superior item to Sunfire for defensive purposes.

Beyond that, his MR is best seen through a Maw of Malmortius, mainly because he can healbait the shield to get a substantial AD steroid and keep himself out of danger as soon as it procs. Wit's End just doesn't sit well with the rest of his kit, especially when you remove Sunfire as suboptimal."

mkvgtired,europe,1391194344.0,"&gt;PensionDanmark demanded warranty for the entire amount

Sorry, not trying to beat a dead horse. I meant to reply to you yesterday. The reason the Danish government did not chose the PensionDenmark proposal is because they wanted the government to insure any losses they might have from the deal. So essentially they wanted to keep the profits, but have taxpayers pay for all the losses. 

For that deal the taxpayers should have gotten more than a 40% premium for being exposed to all the risk IMHO. I'm not sure if the GS deal is a good one, but typically selling profits but keeping all the risk could definitely cause some problems.

In the situation you describe,  you are now stuck with your scout main on medic and your medic main on scout until the next time both are dead. They can't swap back without losing whatever uber is built up. The scout is probably a worse medic, and the medic is almost definitely an inferior scout. Assuming you don't just lose the round anyway, if you try to push out you are going to have one of your most important classes being played by the wrong player for the rest of the round.

From an attacking point of view, you almost definitely have uber advantage since you just killed their med. You should be able to push before that 5 seconds makes a difference. You have a numbers advantage that can't be shortened. If they go for a switch, you have a skill advantage on the flank, since it's a rare medic who's as good as his scouts on scout.

To some people, that hybrid is enough unlike other music that it is off-putting or worthy of dismissal.

I'm sure some people are racist and stupid, but... There are plenty of white hip-hop artists out there, and plenty of racists like hip-hop anyway. The two qualities are not directly related. There might be some tendency, but there are people who are perfectly just in their perception of race, and don't like hip hop, as a genre, on its merits -- the same way old people didn't like rock and roll (okay, some of them objected to the rebellious nature), some people think Jazz is boring, some people just don't understand techno, and a whole lot of people say they hate country."

sunofabeeeyetch,AskReddit,1391194644.0,"I'll flip the question back on you. Do you have a source for all bullies being from 100% bad situations? No, because it simply isn't true. Assertions, assertions.

Forgiveness is reserved for people whose actions can be redeemed by remorse. Bullying is not one of those acts. Besides which, yes, forgiveness is largely reserved for *good* people who *make mistakes*, not *bad* people who *fuck shit up for shits and giggles*. Comprendes?

The consequences I speak of also include bullies having their subsequently painful experiences laughed at. Pain and humiliation are consequences of their actions, and they are not excused from them. It's up to the wronged to laugh or not, but there is nothing wrong in deriving pleasure from it in and of itself.

Your constant knocking on free will is, at most, a cop-out. While you may have never said it explicitly, your tone inches more and more towards ""free bullies from the consequences of their actions""; the study you present to me does nothing to disprove free will insofar as people can still plan their actions beyond some arbitrary number in real-time. Perhaps there is a delay between the subconscious and conscious, but the choice still lies within the person--even if it only manifests a little bit later. Your ""free will is an illusion"" ideology is irrelevant to this matter anyway.

And so what if my genes and environment determine what I am? Your bizarre obsession with physics and biology in a philosophical discussion is grating, and all you're really saying is ""nurture and nature equal personality"" which has no bearing on the discussion. That's like me saying ""rain is wet"" on a discussion about climate change. It doesn't matter that genes and environment have a heavy hand in determining the personality of an individual, what matters is how that individual reacts to it. We're not talking about systemic or institutional discrimination making it harder for minorities to find fulfilling and well-paying jobs, we're talking about bullies who come from all walks of life and why nobody should feel bad when they suffer."

If it is about doing all the things my partner wants to do, changing positions when she wants to, having the foreplay that she wants to, etc. then it is just more stress because suddenly I've become responsible for her pleasure on top off all the other shit I've been dealing with.

So I'm not sure that really helps you much.  If your real question is ""what can I do for him"", then I would think that just making the sex all about him - and not worrying about getting yourself off - would be a good thing to try.

But that doesn't make you stupid or a failure. It just means that you're depressed. If you can try to separate your studies from your self-identity/desire to get good grades in your head (difficult I know, seriously) you might find it gets a lot easier to understand things; if you can see the work as an escape (which maths can be!) instead of something you have to do or else you might start to find it therapeutic rather than a source of anxiety.

Except he does say that

In other words, ""Blacks commit more crimes than whites, therefore they are bad."" 

&gt; Higher rates of poverty are the likeliest cause next to ""thug"" culture and ""anti-white"" sentiment among black youths

Higher rates of poverty created ""thug culture"". Not many people are going to risk their freedom or lives if they can get a cushy job. However, if someone sees crime as their only opportunity to advance, then he/she is more likely to commit a crime. A culture of crime does not stem from being rich with plenty of advancement opportunities.

  Not to mention, there is systematic racism in the United States. Why else would black drug offenders be given prison sentences more often? Why else would black offenders be given the death sentence more? Racism is alive and well in the United States. It might be more subtle, but it exists. To claim otherwise is to be ignorant of reality.

While hitting rock bottom was what helped me, honestly it wasn't the best approach and it nearly cost me life more than once on the way down.

What I suggest doing is seriously sitting down with him and discussing the possibility that he might benefit from seeing a therapist. Tell him that you care about him and that it pains those close to him to witness his self-destructive behavior. Don't be pushy, be supportive. If he's as intelligent as you say he is, he's probably already given it some thought himself and just needs a bit of a push or reassurance.

If it would help at all either of you can feel free to PM me, I'm not a mental health expert or anything but it sounds like he and I are coming from similar positions and if I can save him from having to experience the things I have, I'd like to help.

The game's lead developer, Christian Allen though is certainly a great guy and you can tell that the effort was there, but I do believe that the immense start up cost and the decision to not self publish is what really killed the game, especially when Christian was so passionate about the game. It certainly is a gamble, however I think that crowd funded games for a niche market (In my case tactical first person shooters) are more often than not going to flop, which is a shame because many of these games seem to be crafted with... care. That being said I enjoy Takedown, it's a game that reminds me of how frustrating gaming can be, and how rewarding a success in a game can be. "

imasunbear,videos,1391195211.0,"In a similar vein, I sometimes ask myself, ""Where are the Mozarts and Beethovens of today?"". The world population is orders of magnitude greater than it was a few hundred years ago. You would think there would be someone on par with the composers of the past. Or maybe our standards have risen so it takes someone significantly more talented for us to consider them decent. Maybe if you took a pop-music writer (not a performer) or someone like Jimmy Page or Hendrix and put them back in time so they were contemporaries with Mozart they would absolutely blow him out of the water."

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1391195217.0,"Dump her. Seriously dump this girl. She's immature at best. If she can't understand why you wouldn't be comfortable with her friendship with L than she lacks a much needed dose of empathy. She likes attention more than she respects you. She's not ready to be in a serious, monogamous relationship. 

She's treating horribly and you don't deserve. I'm sure there are some more ""minor"" things you worry over, but honestly I don't think that would be a problem if you knew she at least respected and cared for your feelings. Small problems are 100% easier to deal with if you feel secured, respected, and cared for in your relationship. 

If she wants to flirt and hang around guys who are clearly interested in her then she can go right ahead. That doesn't mean you should be okay with it as her boyfriend and that doesn't mean she can just turn around and call you ""controlling."" If she wants to act like a single girl she can, but she shouldn't be making you feel like shit for being uncomfortable with it, and that doesn't mean she should just be stringing you along. 

If there was one thing that *screams* dump-able offense it would be this: 

&gt; ""you're a pathetic piece of shit"" or ""you're a joke,""

Not okay *at all.* That is verbal abuse. You know the saying, ""Treat people the way you want to be treated?"" Well, you clearly treat her better than that considering the one time you say anything remotely as bad you're racked with guilt. You deserve the same treatment that you give, and that's clearly not happening. Dump. Her. You were right the first time. She treats you like shit and walks all over you like a doormat. You're better than that. 

Surprisingly enough there are girls out there who feel the same way you do. Who would respect boundaries, not try to bring you down a peg when angry, care about you, ect. Don't settle for this girl. She's really not worth it. Whatever ""redeeming"" qualities she has doesn't outweigh all the shit she's putting you through.

Stop being a doormat. I have the same problem as you. I don't like conflict and I can't stand hurting my boyfriend's feeling. You know what though? I've been able to work on that with him. He's encouraged me to express myself more. You need someone who's not going to just shit all over your feelings when you're upset. You need someone who's going to listen to you, encourage you to share your feelings, and respect them. You need someone who's willing to apologize and say you're right every once in awhile. I'm the same way as you and I can promise you that by staying with this girl it's only going to get worse. Then you're going to go into you're next relationship and you're not going to be able to vocalize your feelings as much in fear that they'll hurt her feelings or make her upset. It's not healthy at all. You need to dump this girl because she's going to make any future relationships you have that much harder. Ever fight, every time you step back down, is only going to engrain this in harder. 

Break up with her. Please. She's not a good a girlfriend."

The characters have all been drawn together by dark visions, and are now in the middle of the desert investigating a series of ritual sacrifices they suspect may be part of a plot to awaken a very nasty old spirit. The Technocracy, naturally, has also heard about this and sent agents in to investigate. 

They have now met the Nephandus responsible for the sacrifices twice and are firmly convinced that he is a Technocrat or at least a spy for them, which I find hilarious.

Things you can help me with include work around the house, planning funeral arrangements, and financial worries. In this case lend a hand. I'm going to need your help, strength, and love to get through whatever it is, so be there.

This you cannot help me with include work, grieving, and social (my friends and family) problems. In this case I may need time to relax and sort some stuff out. Don't push, don't pressure me to talk about because I might not be there yet. Just let me know that I can have some time to work it out, and that you'll be there to listen when I'm ready to talk. In the mean time it would be helpful if you could pick up one or two of my chores around the house (I do the same for you) so I have less on my plate.

Drop_,DotA2,1391195685.0,"*Rising Heroes*

**Slardar** will become a regular pick for safelane farming.  His newfound ability to run around fast and blink for no mana along with his bash buff will make him a midgame beast and early rosh hero.  

**Beastmaster** may make a resurgence as a mid hero, or possibly offlane.  His ability to contribute to a push now is higher with the ability to have 2 boars.  He is still one of the kings of stacking ancients and should work well with comps running Luna as well.  

*Edit* Thinking about it more I think Beastmaster will be a pick also due to his generally longer duration BKB piercing stun.  The current meta is really BKB heavy, and I think this asset along with his pushing power and map awareness possible with hawks will push him into the meta. 

**Antimage** fell off quite a bit in 6.79, but IMO he may return in 6.80 with more of a focus on midgame items and earlier teamfight contributions rather than just flash farming until 40ish minutes.  

**Faceless Void** will see an uptick in popularity in specialized comps that can capitalize on the void ult. 

**Dazzle** will become a more common support.  The increased duration on Weave will make long teamfights more difficult to manage, and his ability to sustain a push is amazing which is important currently.  

**Windranger** with the change to her ult she will become even more popular as an offlane/position 3 hero.  The change to her ult not only makes her a better semi-carry, but also a better tower killer, which makes her fit much better in the current meta. 

*Edit* Thinking about it more I think WR will be a top pick.  She has potential to be a safelane farmer for an extremely potent trilane (Think Nightmare-&gt;Shackleshot-&gt;whatever 3rd nuke), and she has potential to offlane or mid.  The buff to her ult makes her carry potential much higher, which makes her an incredibly versatile pick, being able to take any of the positions 1-5.  She will be first pick material because she is a strong hero, and she generally doesn't show your hand as far as strategy goes.  (I hope to see Atos WR as well, Aui, don't let me down).  

*Falling Heroes*

**Enchantress** - The -1 armor is pretty brutal for her early.  It will mandate an early point in untouchable and make her very vulnerable in the level 1-4 timeframe imo.  This should be enough to make chen the generally dominant pick for creep wrangling.  

**Alchemist** The changes to his stun make it harder to get off and simultanesosly reduced the general duration of the stun.  It will make shadowblade Alch much less potent and higher risk than before.  

**Shadow Shaman** Briefly saw a huge increase in popularity from the rosh trap bug.  Will now probably fall off significantly or completely.  

A general prediction is that all blink reliant heroes will see an uptick in popularity.

AdamColligan,askscience,1391195710.0,"EM waves include all of the waves that we think of as ""starlight"" -- that is to say, the photons that pour out of the sun, and so it might be useful to just start with how such starlight gets made.

The sun mostly makes light by performing the [proton-proton chain reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-proton_chain_reaction). 

You probably know that the sun fuses hydrogen into helium, and you probably also know that a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron, but a normal helium atom has two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons. In high school, at least in my case, they never really drew your attention to that: I mean, where do the neutrons come from?

In particle physics, particles routinely decay into one or more other particles or merge with one or more other particles in order to form new ones. A proton can be converted into a neutron by having it give off a positron (the antimatter mirror of an electron) along with a very light particle called an electron neutrino. Fun fact: when a neutron star forms, the intense gravity crushes electrons (the normal matter version) and protons together, and when this happens, they also form a neutron and give off an electron neutrino. (Adding an electron to a proton is the same thing as subtracting an anti-electron from it!).

Anyway, you now have antimatter in the form of positrons (anti-electrons) in the middle of your star. A positron will very quickly seek out a nearby electron, and the two annihilate one another -- or, more precisely, [they are usually converted into a couple of high-energy photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron%E2%80%93positron_annihilation). And photons *are* EM waves. So that's one way you can ""generate"" them without what you probably normally think of as a big, moving electric generator contraption.

Further photons are released by other processes as the proton-proton reaction series continues, which you can read about on that first Wikipedia link. Now, these photons, which are primarily gamma rays, do not just travel straight out of the star and reach us in 8 minutes. The environment around them is too dense. Instead, they get absorbed by other electrons, protons, helium nuclei, etc., around them. They can then contribute to further reactions, or they can get re-emitted at a different wavelength, with some of the energy being used to, for example, give an atom a kick of kinetic energy, increasing its speed and so upping the temperature of the star.

After literally thousands of years of being absorbed and then kicked back out in random directions, the photons/EM waves generated by the reactions in the core finally make their way to the surface. At this point, there are very few photons left that are super high-energy (gamma rays or X-rays).  The wavelengths of photon that finally get emitted and escape into space without being reabsorbed form [this spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EffectiveTemperature_300dpi_e.png).

In addition, having all this superheated, often electrically-charged plasma churning around throughout the sun also [results in large-scale magnetic field lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#Magnetic_field) that move and fluctuate. So solar activity like flares and sunspots are also tied up with broader pertubances in the electromagnetic field that surrounds the star. Those are disturbances that might be more in line with what you are thinking of in terms of a dynamo producing electromagnetic energy."

PirateCodingMonkey,askgaybros,1391195720.0,"usually my advice is to talk to him about what you are feeling, but since you have already done that and he ""brushes it off"" you need to decide if the lack of affection is worth the relationship. you can't make him change, so the only thing you can do is make a change yourself. if you can get him to go, i would suggest seeing a couples councilor.

if he won't go to a councilor with you and doesn't listen to your concerns, is it really worth your time to stay with him? i know that no one likes to be alone but in this case you are basically in a ""loveless marriage"".

as for you, you say you are not ""a great looking guy"" and yet he was interested in you, so that means that there will be others who will as well."

beanfiddler,raisedbynarcissists,1391195732.0,"Wow, OP, I'm so sorry. Your mom is such a shitty person for doing that to you. Dogs are members of a family, and I'm sure yours was an emotional crutch and a confidante that you could rely on when you couldn't rely on your own parent.

Dad did the same sort of thing to my dogs. Not put them to sleep, as far as I know, but getting rid of them. Well, he could have put them to sleep, there's no way of me knowing. Anyway, we had two dogs. One of which was obviously my dog. She was shy and skittish and pretty high maintenance -- allergies, sensitive skin, and white fur that needed to be bathed about twice a week. Dad always beat the dogs to teach them ""obedience,"" which somehow worked with the two male dogs we had before.

Except with Mia, she'd just yelp and hide under my bed. It would take her days to come out afterwards, and not before she peed under a bed, sending my father into even higher of a rage.

So I went off to college, and Mia became my step mother's dog. She's pretty much a narcissist too, but unlike my father, not a sociopath to animals. But that changed when they got a bug up their ass and decided that they were tired of living the suburban life, and that they immediately need to move someplace rural and start a farm. Mostly for tax-dodging purposes.

Anyway, Mia is a wire-haired rat terrier. They're runners, and the property they bought wasn't fenced in. Plus, they're moving to a state notorious for allergies, which would probably kill her. So they literally drive up to the place I'm renting, and tell me to say goodbye to my dog, because they can't keep her where they're moving. No notice, no nothing. I can't even attempt to move into some place where I can take her (and I actually wanted to), that's just it. And need I mention, it's the middle of finals?

I contacted the rescue that they gave her too, and they assured me she's fine, but wouldn't give me the name of the person who adopted her, citing confidentiality. But I wonder; I would seriously not put it above my folks to kill my dog just because they decided she was inconvenient, just like your mother did.

The same thing happened when my parents got divorced when I was 7. Dad took the dog, dad got rid of the dog. Mom says he gave it to someone else, but since she refuses to elaborate, I'm guessing he put it to sleep.

To this day, I have panic attacks over my cat. I wake up from incredibly vivid dreams of my roommate deciding that the cat is too messy, and putting him down while I'm on vacation. Or I feed him and leave for the night to see my girlfriend, and then have a panic attack at her house because I don't remember if I locked and shut the door, and think about how he can get out and get hit by a car.

I'm sorry, OP. Parents that fuck with pets really fuck with your emotions."

arcticfox00,asktransgender,1391195790.0,"Okay then, sorry for taking so long to get back to you. First thing I'd like to point out, and please don't take this too harshly, but 'transgender' isn't a noun. It's like saying ""I saw a black/gay/etc today"". It should be ""I saw a black/gay/transgender *person* today."" It's not always apparent at first, but hopefully you can understand why we prefer that.

The thing with protocol for pronouns is a bit tricky. There's a bit of disagreement about what's best. I mean, obviously, it would seem like it's best to ask that person, right? ""Hey, which pronouns do you prefer?"" But if someone is presenting female and maybe not passing that well (ie, they don't ""look"" female to you), it can be kind of crushing that it isn't apparent. My answer certainly isn't the definitive one, but I think it's good to go with what a person is presenting as, regardless if they ""pass"" or not. If you really can't tell, then maybe ask at that point. If you guess wrong and use the wrong pronouns, and someone corrects you, just say ""Sorry"" and move on. If you use the wrong pronouns accidentally, just say ""Sorry"" and move on. Try not to over-apologise or make a big deal out of it.

And yeah, I think it makes sense that cis people (people who aren't trans people - *cis* and *trans* are scientific prefixes meaning ""on the same side"" and ""on the opposite side"", respectively), cis people commonly have a 'blind spot' for their own gender. It's just not a big deal for you guys - and there's nothing wrong with that - it just might make it hard to understand how anyone could *not* feel that way.

But yeah... with those questions... a lot of them are simply inherently offensive. At least, on a personal level. There's a way to approach it objectively, and while it would make sense to just ask people who have gone through it before, it's really intrusive, and like I said, offensive. It's understandable that you'd choose that route, though; the whole technique and results thing isn't widely published and can be hard to find.

Here's what I would suggest, though: look at web-pages of prominent GRS surgeons. It's a pretty simple Google search, and I can give you some names, if you like, and a few links to start you off: [[Suporn]](http://www.supornclinic.com/), [[Chettwaut]](http://www.chet-plasticsurgery.com/?page_id=684) (the two most prominent Thai surgeons); [[Menard]](http://www.grsmontreal.com/anglais.html) (he does a lot of surgeries for Canadians); [[Bowers]](http://www.marcibowers.com/grs/gender.html), [[Meltzer]](http://www.tmeltzer.com/) - look for the ""Surgeries and Procedures"" drop-down box, [[McGinn]](http://www.drchristinemcginn.com/) - I'd recommend starting here, lots of info (these are all American surgeons). Also, for actual pictures of post-op vaginas, there's [[Anne Lawrence's page]](http://www.annelawrence.com/srsindex.html), although that doesn't showcase those surgeons' latest work. I'm a trans woman, so unfortunately I'm biased towards finding information about trans women, so that's lacking a lot of information about surgeries and whatnot for trans men.

Just remember, there's some things that just cross the line. I know you want to know them, but please just keep in mind how personal those questions are. And the latter half of my second-to-last paragraph in my earlier post. That's really important.

In any case, I hope this information helps you. I appreciate you being calm and respectful, and receptive to new ideas. You'd be amazed at how many people start off by saying ""I know nothing about you people"", and yet when we start telling them about ourselves and how all this stuff works, they suddenly know everything, and we're all just wrong to them. They let their preconceptions get to them, and that's really harmful. It's people like you who make the world a better place."

I used the [thermalarc 161](http://victortechnologies.com/thermalarc/products/detailProduct.html?prodID=W1003603) doing commercial kitchen and residential work, it was pretty capable.

If you want really good quality welds though, you're going to have to put out the money and get something with some active control, either a foot-pedal, or finger controls. Having used both, I find the foot pedal far more intuitive to use, but limited by space and with the finger controls you eliminate one more item to move around with you.

Up to about 12 ga, 110v is doable, over that though and you'll be able to do it, but you'll have to spend more time.  

The smaller, portable machines are usually stripped of all the really nice features, move over to something like a Miller Dynasty DX which offers similar portability, the ability to weld AC but costs almost twice as much."

But what these statistics report is undernourishment of the kind *that leads directly to stunting, wasting, and severe micronutrient deficiency*, among other undesirable outcomes.

That being said our own food system could use some serious work re: food desert and a whole range of other issues.

And you may be right that a lot of the people I'm talking about aren't going to die tomorrow of starvation, and cause of death may not even be listed as starvation. But if you don't think it shortens their life *a lot* (especially for the children who aren't getting enough to eat who may die before age 5), then you'd be fooling yourself. 

The fact is, there are millions of people who don't have enough to eat, simply because they can't afford it. This is the most obviously malfunctioning thing about our global economy today that I can name. Food is *the first* economic priority of any person, and yet 850 million people cannot satisfy even this need. You've got to eat. "

4th ed is VERY different to the other editions of d&amp;d. The most noticable being that it has at-will powers that you can cast as many times as you want (hence it works in an mmo setting). I can't remember exactly how things have changed (I haven't read the rules, I just watched some friends play a bit) but it seems they changed almost everything about it, though some things have only been changed a little. It definitely relies much more on having a board and making the encounters more strategic, with a lot more powers involving movement.

Nope. Legally, a conviction rape requires, at least, that the rapist has no reasonable justification to believe that there is consent.

geeked_outHyperbagel,childfree,1391196203.0,"&gt; *My fiancee also really likes me mom and doesn't want my mom to stop liking her, so she is scared of telling them.*

Oh. Well if you want your mom to like your fiance, then have children, preferably as many as your parents wish for your to have.  I mean. That's the most important thing, right? 

See how silly that sounds?  It's your life. Live it as you (and your fiance) see fit.  

It seems like you genuinely care about your parents and I can see this going one of two ways: 

 1.  You just continue to live your life and not have children. Eventually, they will figure it out. 
 2. You have a serious talk with them. Doesn't have to be angry or snarky.  *""Mom, dad I love you very much thank you for doing a great job raising me, etc. (whatever you feel is appropriate to say here).  I am now my own independent adult and children are not a part of my future. This is the path that will make me and my fiance happiest and I hope that you are able to understand that.""*


Maybe they won't *like* it, but if you are straightforward, they will very likely *respect* it and you won't have to play any sort of subtle emotionally passive-aggressive games every time there is a family gathering from here on out.

If you have such a friend, consider yourself lucky because it is hard to find such a friend. Also you have to not mind that your friend might hear you.

If either of you have access to a car and can drive, car sex can be just as viable, just find a really discreet spot (think parking space at ECP on a weekday night) and you're good to go. Do remember that you can get caught, so be extra careful and err on the safe side. ;)

We would most likely team up with another family that we know who's father is a surgeon and has an extensive first aid kit. To survive we'll hunt squirrels and small game with the AR along with subsistence based agriculture growing specifically wheat, corn and strawberries all within the forest so as to not gain attention. All of those seeds i currently own . For housing i would bring a couple of tents, sleeping bags, a felling axe, a splitting maul and a hammer.

I have class with several history majors and all of the men are focusing on World War 2 for their final papers. I find World War 1 much more fascinating in terms of causation and content. I get the impression that it's an American sentiment.

Because the conflict was the grandest expression of masculine values since the Roman Empire. WWI was not that interesting primarily because it was just a meat grinder and the war itself was a slow and uneventful for most parties. WWI can basically be summed up as ""sit in this trench. Dont get shot"". WWII features some pretty incredible men, fighting forces, a rapid advancement in technology, especially in tanks, and firearms.

Erisari,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1391196586.0,"Hahahaha my favorite snow day was when I was younger. I grew up on a street that was a one-way hill going down. My childhood home (my dad still lives there) has a hill in the backyard going perpendicular to the street. This hill is awesome for three reasons: 1) it's a slightly wavy hill, meaning that it's got two-three ""bumps"" so you can go airborne; 2) there is a sewer top somewhat on the left of the hill near the bottom, it makes for a great ramp; and 3) there was (it's not there anymore) one tree on the edge of the yard not really in the way making the yard great for sled riding! 

Well on this particularly snowy morning, I was about 6 or 7 years old and had just received my first real sled for my birthday. It was a huge two-seater sled and was bright orange. I had been going down the hill for about 30 minutes or so, when my dad came home for lunch as he typically did every day because he worked with in walking distance. I'm in the back yard laughing and hollering, enjoying the day and the snow. My dad comes down the driveway and sees that I'm sled-riding. He asks nicely for a turn and I hand him the sled. 

My dad places on it in the middle of the top of the hill and sits down on the sled pushing himself all the way back so his legs are straight and completely on the sled. He grabs the little rope and scoots the sled forward to the edge of the hill. Tilting ever so slightly, teetering on the edge, I watch him slowly start his decent down the middle of the hill. Suddenly, the sled makes a sharp right turn and during the last second of my dad's ride... He smacks right into the lonely tree! 

He gets up from the sled and raises his head to look at me standing at the top of the hill. I'm laughing. He looks down and shakes his head. He makes his ascent up the hill and hands me my cracked sled. We both walk into the basement laughing.

My dad hit the one and only tree in our yard. It was the funniest thing I'd ever seen :)"

JihadTape,malefashionadvice,1391196694.0,"I disagree. When the CDB's in 2 different sizes are the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever worn, there is no ""just give it time"" that makes sense. Now is the style spot on? Sure, like I said before, Chukka boots are great. But CDB's are cheap shit versions of an otherwise great style. If it was just ""eh, these aren't that great"" then I wouldn't question it, but when my response is ""holy shit these are awful"" then I start to become suspicious. A totally valid response to MFA.

It's hard to describe the Sperry problem. Basically, the back inch of the sole is super squishy, then it gets more ""stable"" up front. So there exists this ""cliff"" where the shoe sole goes from squishy to not squishy, and that difference in sole is a big discomfort. This is possibly just a bad pair. Like I also said, they were comfy in the store, and the Sperry Gold are WAYYYY better than the plain A/O.

So no, I'm not wrong. I'm spot fucking on. MFA has style, but the recomendations are cheap versions of what you *should* buy. Skip the CDB's and get a Chukka from Cole Hann, Alden, or Allen Edmond, and watch it last for 10 years. Don't go with Sperry, get the boat shoe from Oak Street (or get the more expensive Gold Cup Sperry) and enjoy a huge uptick in longevity and comfort."

Samipearl19,Cooking,1391196733.0,"White wine reduction with mushrooms and cream:

1/2 yellow onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
6-8 oz baby bella mushrooms, sliced
6 tbs butter
2 tbs olive oil
1 cup dry white wine
1/3 cup cream

Melt half the butter in a sauce pan and add olive oil. Saute onions until translucent. Add garlic; saute until lightly golden. Add white wine and reduce by at least half (I usually go almost all the way). Melt the rest of the butter and add the mushrooms. Saute until softened. Remove from heat and add cream, stirring until combined.

Obviously, season all this with S&amp;P while cooking. I usually throw in a good amount of dried basil while the wine is reducing. This is fantastic on pasta or as a sauce for meat, particularly steak. A dash of some citrus juice gives it a kick, or you can throw in some crushed red pepper for some heat.

Also SRS has had to enforce its culture with moderators, removing some moderate voices over time, whereas twitter/tumblr are unmoderated and the extremes are free to find each other to create unfettered circlejerks by tagging/browsing tags.

I would love to see how a feminist/SJ imageboard would do. There are limitations with that format which present problems for nuanced discussion. I predict it would be similar amounts of stupid as 4chan/tumblr/twitter."

She's just not very food motivated and there was nothing more enticing than a good deer chase (even chasing us on a mountain bike). 

Even with the positive punishment, we made she she had NO IDEA it was coming from us (and in fact I made sure I was there to comfort her immediately with lots of love and treats). If she had thought it was me doing it, it could have been devastating for our relationship. She is a smart, sensitive, and slightly fearful dog. Using dominance methods on her would have greatly deteriorated our relationship. She would either have become afraid of us or gotten smart and realized that we are not omnipotent and can't punish her for EVERY misstep (whereas now she has never tried to push those buttons because she enjoys obeying).

So if we had to choose between the stadium or getting a new team in 10 years the stadium now is the better fiscal choice.

I actually think it would have taken quite a while for the Vikings to move, if at all. LA had a long way to go to get a stadium built, and they wanted more control over it than the NFL seemed willing to give them. But if the Vikings stayed at the Metrodome for 3-4 more years I could see them leaving around then.

Which is why I really hate this 'be confident' advice, because confidence is earned through experience, and just like that first job, you don't just get it, somebody has to take a chance on you and help you build it. Confidence is just past experience affecting your assessment of current situation; but that past experience has to come from somewhere.

I'm a pretty confident person now, but I know that came from good experience starting to outweigh the bad, I owe it to the people around me that taught me that I have redeeming qualities, and it was a long slow build to get there. It's obviously not the same for everyone, some people have to dig themselves out of a pretty deep hole to get to where others start from, while for others it will come much easier.

kuma_k,Games,1391196989.0,"&gt; the biggest complaint for third party devs dealing with the Wii U is that it's too hard to compete with Nintendos first party titles.

I know Nintendo's IP's are extremely popular, and generally well-worth the attention, but I don't see how MS and Sony are really exceptions.  The way I've seen it, 3rd parties are more inclined to go elsewhere because they don't have to deal with the limitations (weaker hardware, unique controllers, etc) that Nintendo imposes.

&gt; I feel that your point of view in the second point... may be influenced by a negative outlook towards Nintendo.

I suppose that's true, I do blame Nintendo for trying to... innovate, I suppose, by making their controller into a huge touchscreen gamepad.  But now we're seeing MS and Sony add tablet support, without making it (1) mandatory, (2) gimmicky, or (3) limiting.  In Nintendo's defense, that may be entirely because of what they saw the Wii U could be capable of, they just took it in a better direction.

&gt; (In my opinion, ps2-era was the final ""large"" upgrade that consoles have had in terms of graphical capabilities, although there have been improvements sense, their not as massive.)

Since the Internet was newer, so was the concept of easy access to information.  So he used to fuck with me *all* the time.

When we got stuck in a level on Lion King for SNES, he said, ""I'll go ask my computer,"" and came back with a walkthrough.  He convinced me the computer knows the answers to everyone (well, he was right I guess).

Another time, he used Mapquest to find out where a friend's house was so he could drop me off there.  He marked the destination peg as ""Casey's House"".  I was just like, how the *fuck* does the computer know it's CASEY'S HOUSE!?

Again, I NEVER spot. It's annoying since it seems I'm just going to have a long period. I'm mainly hoping that it stops for a bit after next week.

I really didn't.  I didn't say anything about medical marijuana users.  I said that lots of dispensaries were acting as fronts for recreational sales.

That in no way means I was saying there aren't legitimate medical marijuana users.  Not at all.


&gt;Yes, several research centers and dispenceries were shut down as well as quite a few farms doing nothing but following the law. It is really amazing how you made claims like you did when you admit you don't know what has been going on.

All that I said was that I'm not aware of the specific cases that were pursued, but that the claim the DOJ made was that they were going after fronts.  The claim I was disputing was the one that stated the DOJ claimed they weren't going to take any type of action, and then went out and did.  They never said they weren't going to take any type of action.  What I was saying I was and am still ignorant of is whether or not the DOJ really did go against what they claimed.  They may have... but there's a common misconception about they claimed in the first place.

Pajamas to class (or stores, or *anywhere*) should **not** be a thing. But it is. Why? Because we dress down too much. Pretty soon people will just wear their underwear as soon as they're able to socially get away with it.

Personally, I think the my immediate social arena is so casual that I can't dress how I like, at least without serious stares/annoyance. Anytime I try to shop for 'dressy' items, like blazers, dresses, heels, etc, I am asked by everyone: ""Where are you going to wear that?"" ""Is this for church or office?"" ""Where are you going all dressed up?"" ""Wow, do you have an interview?""

chronic_raptor,asktransgender,1391197738.0,"Passing is definitely a privilege, but privilege isn't something you should be sorry for having.  There will always be people who are jealous, or who try to tear you down because of what they can't have.  I'm fairly passable myself, but I'm still definitely jealous of those trans girls who are slimmer, more shapely, etc. than I am.

What you have to do with passing privilege, like any privilege, is be aware of it.  You have to take into account and be respectful of the fact that many people in your community can never be as satisfied with their bodies as you can.  Again, you shouldn't feel ashamed, but you should absolutely avoid being hurtful to other people about it.  Avoid being condescending.  Make consideration and room in your language for people who either can't pass or don't choose to pass.  Put their needs before your own in this setting.

Giving a talk where you air your grievances might call attention to your privilege, but it certainly isn't out of line.  Just because you have it better than some in one arena, doesn't mean you can't talk about how it still stresses you out; and it CERTAINLY doesn't mean that you can't discuss other problems that you have.  Your feelings are real and legitimate and anyone who would tear you down simply because they have it worse (unless you refuse to acknowledge that) is a petty person."

nympherret,CompulsiveSkinPicking,1391197770.0,"I have tattoos! My first tattoo went about as badly as it could have with someone with my condition. First of all, tattoos peel and flake a lot more than anyone tells you. This is normal, but my tattoo is big, and there was a lot of oh-so-satisfying peelies.... Second, they shave you for the tat, and I for some reason had a HUGE outbreak of ENORMOUS ingrown hairs all over and around my tattoo afterward. It took just about every cell in my body to not pick them all. The worst part was that they were extremely painful too!! I had to have my picky mom get some for me (and then show me the stuff that came out lololol).

I have a friend who has derma as well, and we both find it easy to not pick on our tattoos for fear of ruining them, but every once in a while we do get a couple, and it can indeed leave scars and fading. I have a little spot on my velociraptor's finger that is lighter than the rest of it from a big zit I popped.

I pick mostly on my arms, and I want to get a tattoo on them, so I asked my artist what he thought. You of course can't tattoo over open wounds, or even little scabs. Scars are usually fine if they're relatively flat, but lil bumps will show up! Artists are usually more than happy to work with your body though.

No. That to me would qualify more under Experimental.

Easy, if it's physically technical, that doesn't immediately make it Progressive, if it's compositionally technical however, most likely yes!

&gt; Is all Djent considered Prog? How many more times can I say Prog in this post?

Well, here's the official word from the fellas over at Got-Djent.com:

&gt;At got-djent.com, we take a very open-minded and all-inclusive approach to determine which bands belong in our database and which don't. I would say a non-negligible portion of those bands does not qualify as 'progessive metal' at the moment. You can use palm muted double stacked power chords, syncopation, etc. without necessarily sounding progressive, in my opinion. In fact, some of the bands in our database barely even qualify as metal, but I would still consider them djent.
So my answer would be no. In my opinion, 'djent' is a feature that is somewhat orthogonal to 'progressiveness'.

MightySasquatch,television,1391197824.0,"Slippery slope is a fallacy of logic, will people stop arguing that everything is a slippery slope?

'If they allow one type of censorship, what will stop the rest'. It will get stopped the way anything gets stopped. In this case, since it is a corporation censoring what they will play on the air, then the censorship stops when the corporation thinks it is in their best interest for it to stop. In the case of government censorship, then it is stopped when, in the opinion of the Courts, that the censorship has gone too far. It doesn't need a magical 'breakline point' that every person in the world thinks that they know what the point is every time they hear someone is censored for any reason.

And, for what it's worth, censorship is getting more lax, not more restrictive. Trey Parker and Matt Stone actually gave an interview where they stated that they get away with a shitton more than they used to on the show, and that they had no idea when they started that Comedy Central would let them say what they're saying now with little to no fanfare. 

So stop arguing slippery slope, it is not a legitimate warrant to your argument. And one instance of censorship by a company is not a pattern of worsening censorship.

Tl;dr Slippery slope is bullshit."

After you finish, you usually continue staying at the company or clinic which hired you to be a student nurse. Same for all forms of craftsmen etc.

I hate you, you make me jealous by looking like a handsome guy both with and without facial hair.   And you've got dimples.. thankfully since you are 16 years younger, our target markets likely do not overlap.

**Photos**

Good selection pictures.. I would only suggest keeping the images that match your current look near the top, and then have the others shift down to show off the various other faces of you.   So if you're still sporting a winter beard, take a new bearded picture without the hat, and make that your main profile picture.

**Self-Summary**

Short.. really short and does not really summarize much self.

*I love lamp* hillarious autocorrect error?

**doing with my life**

Well, that qualifies as what you do, but it seems to miss out on whether you are gainfully employed, if so doing what, and what goals/asperations you have for your future.  

**really good at**

Meh.. nothing terrible, but doesn't really stand out on either the creativity or interesting skill side.

Come on, your name is I Make Drawings.. are you telling me you don't have any artistic talent at drawing?

**First Thing**

Yea, you're 6'4"" so that first part is fair enough.

**Favorites**

Well organized.. not the selections I might have guessed at from the profile pictures, but then you haven't acutally *said* anything about yourself that would make for a deeper view.

You are totally missing out on Food.

The food section is one place where a prospective date can picture themselves out with you.. standing in line at Izzy's new location.. sitting across from you at On's Kitchen.. if you leave Food completely blank you're missing out on a hook that could make the difference.

**six things**

Nice and Minnesotan.. and your first mention of any interest/enjoyment of sports or politics.

**thinking about**

Trying really hard to be cute and failing horribly.

**Typical Friday** 

If you're out on your bike tonight, you've got serious grit.  I spotted a couple of guys on bikes coming up Minnehaha last night around 11:30 pm when we'd already gotten down to Zero.. they looked like they were having a great time but damn.. brrrrr. 

Otherwise.. this section is a total snoozefest. 

**Private**

Solid.. attemtped to be cute.. succeeded.

**looking for**

You'll go an entire decade younger than yourself, but only 4 years older than yourself?

**message me if**

Meh.. not terrible, but there's a lot of Ron Swanson fandom going around lately.

**Overall**

You are coming across as the guy who's too busy trying to be suave and attractive and doesn't want to be honest or put anything out there and take a risk.

You didn't even make it up to doing a half assed job.. more like a quarter."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1391197954.0,"Oh please give me a break and get off your high horse. I know just as well as you do the dems aren't perfect. I'm pretty far to the left of them at this point, considering how I advocate for stuff like basic income and all, which is something not even on the democrats' radar. But to say both parties are the same is galse equivalency. There ARE differences between the parties. MAJOR differences. If you haven't looked lately, the republicans are...well...absolutely, utterly insane. They obstruct and shut down the government at every turn, and espouse a hypocritical and blatantly pro rich, small government agenda. 

The democrats may be in the corporate pockets too, but at least they're not recommending we completely dismantle our social safety nets and privatize everything. 

If I had to grade the democratic party, they would get like a C- from me. They're okay, but only OKAY. They're sane at least, and aren't recommending we radically change America into a banana republic.

The republicans get a big fat F. Seriously. They're wrong on most issues,a nd the issues they're right on they end up coming off sounding like extremists and that discredits them. They don't even try to hide that they're all for the rich any more. They used to try to pass off their ideas as good for everyone, now they don't even try.

Honestly, there isn't even a viable party that really reflects my current perspective right now. Green party is kinda similarish, but even then. 

Still, if Hillary gets the nomination in 2016, i will hold my nose and vote for her. She isn't who I want any more, she's basically a third term of Obama when I'd really want to give someone like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren a go, but I'll do it to keep sanity. 

You need to understand, politics is complicated. it requires compromise, and it means you won't get everything you want. The dems don't offer everything I want, but I'll settle for them until something closer to my ideals has a viable chance. And the dems, they're held back by a hostile republican house! How can you honestly expect them to pass progressive agenda while they're being labelled as communists and obstructed by the other half of the country. I mean, COME ON."

beefcakez,naturalbodybuilding,1391198234.0,"A good (and fairly short) article explaining how and why to train hamstrings effectively. 

On stage, having great hamstrings will separate the winners, so why not give them as much emphasis as your other bodyparts? Personally, I know that if I try to do both quads and hams in the same workout my hamstrings training is bad. So, in 2009 I started training them on a completely separate day from quads, and it made a world of difference. 

At the very least, training hamstrings will improve your overall athletic performance (according to many physiologists). 

Hope to see you guys out there hitting them hard! 



Good luck!"
sockalicious,explainlikeimfive,1391198234.0,"This is actually not a simple question.  The short answer is that magnetic monopoles would be very interesting if they did exist; but despite a decades long, very serious hunt, none have ever been found.

You may have heard of protons, individual particles that are positively charged; and electrons, individual particles that are negatively charged.  If you've ever petted a cat on a dry day or put on a skirt fresh out of the dryer, you may even have built up an electric field, which might have made the cat's fur stand on end, and you might have felt a funny tingling in your finger tips or had your skirt show static cling.  This is the kind of thing that can happen when you get an excess of positive or negative electric field charges on an object; like charges repel, so if each cat hair is positively charged, it tends to repel its positively-charged neighbor hairs.

If you recall an old CRT TV (cathode-ray tube); well, the cathode ray is a beam of electrons, each one carrying a negative charge; constantly hitting the screen.  If you ever touched an old CRT screen while it was on, you felt that static charge; that is a consequence of the fact that the glass of the screen was saturated with an excess of negatively charged electrons from the cathode-ray beam!

So we understand that electric charges can be on particles, all by their lonesome, and you can beam these particles around, and the charges transfer to objects, and so objects can be charged up with positive or negative electrical charges.

Now a magnetic field is intimately associated with this kind of electric field.  In fact, a magnetic field is always generated when an electric field is *changing over time*.  But wherever we find a place in this field that is a magnetic 'north', we find that there must be a magnetic 'south' somewhere nearby.  We just don't find any magnetic 'norths' without a 'south' connected to it.

Metal bar and U magnets are a special case of the behavior of electromagnetic fields in certain metal media; they are really peculiar things and [if Feynman can't adequately explain them to an adult](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn_8) then I certainly don't think I could do better for a 5 year old.

So we've observed that we just don't find 'norths' floating around in space, or anywhere else; the way that we do in fact find negatively charged electrons floating around in space.  Mathematically this is expressed as one of [Maxwell's equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations) which are four equations that describe very, very fundamental statements about the physical reality of our universe.  (The particular equation in question, [Gauss' law of magnetism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law_for_magnetism), basically is a fancy mathematical way of saying that magnetic monopoles do not exist, can never exist.)

Why do we even talk about magnetic monopoles, then?  Well, it's because it's deeply unsatisfying for a lot of math and physics people that the laws describing electric fields are not symmetric to the laws describing magnetic fields.  If in fact isolated magnetic 'norths' and 'souths' - monopoles - really *did* exist, then the equations describing electric fields would be exactly symmetric to the equations describing magnetic fields, and that would make a lot of other equations much more 'clean' and easy to deal with, for the math-y and physics-y people who like to describe the world by dealing with those type of equations.

Another reason we still talk about monopoles is that they're not forbidden by all the laws of physics that we've managed to discover.  We know nothing can travel faster than *c*, the speed of light.  We know that mass-energy can't be created or destroyed.  We know an object in motion tends to stay in motion and an object at rest tends to stay at rest.  We know a heck of a lot of things about the real world.

None of the things that we know seem to say that magnetic monopoles can't exist!  It's just an observation that's been made.  And the law that came out of this observation, Gauss' law for magnetism, is an incredibly important foundation block for a lot of physics that came after it.

For all we know, magnetic monopoles *could* exist.  In that case, a lot of smart physicists have gotten a lot of things totally wrong in the Standard Model of physics - it would change everything.  But very clever people have devised very clever experiments to hunt for magnetic monopoles - the hunt has been on for nearly 100 years - and none have ever been found.

Every so often, by the way, some quirky low-temperature quantum physics experimentalist will do something with a flux tube or a Bose-Einstein condensate and a journalist will pick up the story and write about magnetic monopoles.  To explain like you're five:  these journalists are idiots who don't know what they're talking about.  They ought not to write such articles; they are muddling up two completely different topics in a very confusing way."

oyveyski,AskReddit,1391198350.0,"In the summer after my first year of university, I was living back in my home town and working 6 days a week at my summer job. I had a friend in town who was still in high school at the time and we hung out quite a bit that summer. Her life was always surrounded by endless drama. With her family, her friends, her boyfriend... It never ended and she was always leaning on me for support. I really sympathized with her at the time so I let her get away with a lot of shit and I really regret it now. 

On my birthday, we were all partying at my house. She was underage and couldn't buy her own alcohol but she notice some beer in the fridge that no one was drinking and asked if she could have some. I told her sure, she could have *one* (it was the beer my mom kept in the house for company, I knew she wouldn't miss it but I knew it would be rude to offer it all up). By the end of the night, she had finished most of the 6 pack. 

I let her crash at my house that night since things were so rough for her at home, but I let her know that I had plans at 11 the next morning so she would have to be up and out before then. She wasn't so drunk that this could've just slipped her mind; she was well aware that that was the deal. Around 8:30 the next morning, she gets up and I was pretty relieved that I wouldn't have to go in and shake her awake. I started to make her some breakfast but it turns out she had just gotten up to use the washroom and so she went back to bed and slept for a couple more hours. When I finally went and got her out of bed, it got much worse. 

She went to the bathroom to get ready and asked me for some moisturizer. I gave her a bottle of pretty standard lotion, nothing too heavy but it wasn't specifically designed for the face. I guess that wasn't good enough because she demanded to use my nice facial moisturizer, and ended up using the last of it. It was pretty nice stuff, one of my few indulgences as a college student, so I was pretty disappointed. Next, she went to get dressed. She had plans with a friend that day and didn't want to wear the same outfit as the day before, so she asked to borrow a top. I gave her an old tank top, nothing too ratty but something I wouldn't miss if I didn't get it back. She looked at it and said, ""uh, do you have anything *nicer*?"" For reasons unknown, I caved and let her take one of my favourite tops. 

By this time, my friend other arrived to pick me up. The friend who had stayed the night wasn't ready to go yet, so she told me we should go and she would lock up when she left. Uh, no. It was my mom's house and she tended to keep quite a bit of cash in her room so I really didn't feel comfortable leaving her there, so we had to sit around and wait another hour until her friend came and picked her up. 

She called me a few times over the rest of that summer to meet up and talk about all of the awful drama in her life, but because of my crazy work schedule it just didn't work out. Finally, at the end of the summer, I wanted my top back. She wasn't available on my day off, so we agreed to meet early one morning for coffee before I had to go to work. I dragged myself out of bed two hours early, got ready, and then texted her to see if she was on her way....nope. She had some sort of family situation go down the night before and couldn't meet me after all. I never did hear what the situation was, so maybe it really was so dire that she couldn't have contacted me, but I was just so pissed off. A simple text to let me know I didn't have to get up so early when I was already so exhausted would have been nice. 

I never ever got my top back. I realized later in life that she was the central cause in all of the drama in her life. I think she really thrived on it. She would tell long-winded stories about how she had been the victim in some unbelievable situation, and then 15 minutes later when another friend came and joined the conversation,  she would tell it again, but with more tears and embellishments. I understand that everyone faces troubles in their life and it isn't always their own fault, but I find it hard to believe that this girl could have that caliber of problems on a weekly basis without playing an active role in it. I wish her well in her life but I am so happy to have washed my hands of her. The amount of energy it took to be friends with her was just not worth it.

&gt; The movie is about ""down on their luck"" salesmen trying to sell bullshit vacation properties in Florida, but if you extrapolate what he's talking about, and replace the concept of ""property"" with ""women"", it's striking how the similarities parallel. The underlying theme is, for all intents and purposes, ""stop being a pussy and take what is yours.""

So... you are a bullshit man (vacation property) that no woman should be willing to talk to (buy). Your job is to convince women to blow (their life savings on) you. Yeah, that's not morally reprehensible, or anything. /s

Do you remember Ricky Roma from the movie? Al Pacino's character? The only one of them who could sell a damn thing? Don't you remember him saying he had no idea how he did it, and that it was probably luck?

What about this: do you remember that couple that Shelley finally managed to sell to? And do you remember how Kevin Spacey told him that that couple always signed, and then never made good on the deals?

Do you realize how shitty these vacation properties are, how shitty this company is, and how shitty this situation is? Or do you think that this whole damn movie is just some happy romp wherein they successfully find the best people who are most deserving of the pussy?

-fire in volleys.

-don't use beam weapons that have no shield penetration until you're pretty good at the game.

-In later stages, target their piloting first, not shields. It usually only has 1 or 2 hits before it is disabled (compared to 2,4,6,8 for shields). A disabled ship can't evade. 

-When being boarded, move your crew to the medbay if you can't win the fight.

As for /u/skateverything 's point, I mostly agree with you not with him. The State doesn't enforce 'free speech' on its citizens or protect people from the consequences of their speech, but it does protect its citizens from violence in general, including violence as a result of their speech.

So mostly free speech is an overused phrase, and as you stated it's just a protection from government interference. However the role of the government in promoting the common welfare does cause them to intervene if one group violently responds to another's speech. "

There's a puzzle box. Work on it?
[y/n] y
You work on it, but can't figure it out.
[Work more/sleep]
You work on it some more, but still can't figure it out. Too bad, you lost.

Because the answer was to go to sleep, and then you have a fucking epiphany about what to do with the goddamned puzzle box and you go do that in the middle of the night and it gives you an item.

How the fuck is that reasonable? From a gameplay perspective, I mean. You have to act like you *don't* want the damn thing. But only after having enough of an interest to give it a shot to begin with. How would you accomplish this unless you kept savescumming over and over again until you figured out what it wanted you to do?"

I was up a week or 2 before Valentines day and booked a flight while she was cooking me breakfast one day I was here. On the day I was going to leave I faked a sinus infection (she knew I had sinus issues back then) and ""went to the doctors"". Called her from the parking lot of the airport telling her I had to get some tests run and the line was huge but I was waiting. Flew up there (2 hours) and called her when I got into her airport, told her I was leaving the lab and on my way home.

Took a train which dumped me right under her building downtown. Called her, told her to come down because the delivery guy is getting crap from the security guard about getting her val day gift. She came down and saw me.

On Valentines Day itself we went to NYC and kind of wandered around. Ended up at Battery Park and got dirty water hotdogs for ""dinner"", because that's how we are. We don't need fancy things, we just need each other.

I knew from experience that this was a naive expectation at best. If I got the impression form a girl I was seeing that she had expectations of the relationship that I didn't, I made sure that was known. If it was determined that we couldn't be what each other wanted, I made it a point to end things as amicably as possible.

I never liked the idea of intentionally stringing someone along. There are a lot of people out there to meet, and life is too short to waste time on unavailable partners.

DCDVath,leagueoflegends,1391199257.0,"He's talking about the opposite side of the coin. When you are in silver 5, playing at a gold 3 level, getting matched with gold 2 and 3 players, yet the system expects you to beat them to get promoted to silver 4. That's frustrating. Because if you are to be promoted from silver 5 to silver 4, you want to face silver 4 players, not gold 3 players. If I'm suppose to carry myself out of bronze or silver, then match me with the people in the tier I'm up for promotion to. That way I am proving that I deserve to be there. The current setup makes getting promoted more of a gamble.

True Scenario: My roommate has played his last 5 matches against gold players. He is in his promotion series from bronze 1 to silver 5. He won the first 2, and lost the second 2. In all games, he wasn't faced against silver 5 players (which is the division he is up for promotion in to). No, instead he is facing gold 3 and 4 players. How does that make sense? In order for him to get to silver 5, he has to beat gold 4 players? Shouldn't he have to beat silver 5 players to get into silver 5?"

Orelle,infj,1391199318.0,"&gt; People refer to the Te steamroller - and that is typically how I experience it; whatever I want becomes irrelevant to whatever task/conversation is being engaged in.

One of the biggest professional challenges I've faced was co-leadership with a Te-user who did this: they Te'd all over my Fe and by the time my Ti was ready to verbalize its feedback, the situation was a done deal (in the mind of the Te-user). My only hope was to get my Ti out of the gate well before their Te. 

This Te-user was smart as a whip, but definitely tried to enforce their worldview over my fact-based objections — for efficiency and to save face — when confronted with information that conflicted with their framework. When pressed to reassess the situation, they said, ""Well, I *believe* that X influences Y."" This statement was actually a gift, because then I could prove they had the wrong impression of X, and thus misinterpreted how it'd influence Y. 

What helped me cope: 

* Writing out streamlined guidelines, concerns, goals, arguments, plans or feedback *in advance* of any potential Te-steamroll situation. It was the only way to compete. Distributing this was helpful for getting on the same page, not so helpful if I wanted credit for my ideas.

* Using to-the-point written communication, instead of verbal, as often as possible. I found that ideas and concerns rebuffed in conversation were addressed if presented as a clear question via email. 

* NOT PROCRASTINATING. Once the Te-user expressed their plan, it was too late to have my interests reflected in their agenda. That was like showing up at a fair and saying, 'The Ferris wheel should be closer to the lake, the garden show should be space-themed, not frontier-themed, and why don't we have a veg*n food booth?' Better luck next year! 

And, shamefully, it did take me about half a year to learn to communicate effectively with this person. Anticipating their moves, having my shit together and putting it on the table *first* was the only way we could work together. Otherwise, my diplomatic leadership style took a backseat to their ordered vision, and our teamwork suffered from impulsiveness and lack of cohesion. 

Yes, it got much better. But it was still pretty exhausting.

GentlemanBAMF,LeagueofLegendsMeta,1391199330.0,"With how strong the defensive tree is, and how well Gangplank scales with AD and offensive sustained damage, I'm actually enjoying a bit of the opposite.

Masteries I run are also 5-22-3. Movespeed is king.

Runes are 3 X MS Quints, 9 X ArPen Marks, 9 X Armor Seals and 9 X MR/lvl Glyphs. 

Start Doran's Shield and Potion. That is the extent of your defensive items for a while. Rush a Tiamat into Brutalizer into Phage, boots wherever you can. Now finish your damage items as you see fit... I like finishing Youmuu's Ghostblade early, the active with Raise Morale is ferocious. Your Ravenous Hydra and Triforce come whenever they may. This gives you reasonable Crit, the strongest Sheen proc, heavy AOE damage and movespeed for days. From here, two defensive items as needed to round out your 6. 

The defensive tree and Scurrvy max keeps you so healthy and safe early it's hard to do wrong in lane. Just make sure you can protect towers or pick up assists with your ultimate, outduel your lane opponent and you'll be laughing. "

That said,

&gt;I'm poor. I'm white. I'm shaped like a threat. I do this. I can't not do this.

I fundamentally disagree with your belief that you have to do this or that this is the right thing to do. As a tall black man who's often out late, I get where you're coming from in terms of noticing the reactions of people (particularly women) you come across, and to some extent I'd agree that the fear some women experience is a direct result of media portrayals (though men see these same things and aren't affected on nearly the same level). That said, for all the consideration you're giving the potential ""victim"" of these interactions, I think you owe the ""perpetrators"" at least a little thought.

What does it say to our boys, particularly those of color, that they need to remove themselves from situations because their presence makes others feel uncomfortable? What does that tell them about themselves? What does that tell them about the world in which they live? 

I don't know what experiences you've had in this regard, but as someone who's had a stranger turn around and look as if they thought they were about to be killed, it feels extremely dehumanizing to be viewed as a monster simply because you look different. For all the preaching we do about not ""judging a book by its cover,"" it's pretty hypocritical that we don't just say it's acceptable, but *encourage* some groups to do it to others."

Though, I never felt uncomfortable or like people thought I was odd or a freak, they seemed more impressed by my height (and perhaps overall frame). Anyone who mentioned it moved on and never seemed phased by it after one joke. I was 17 at the time and a size 20 US.

chrunchy,canada,1391199504.0,"This is a good step, but I don't think it's high enough. Just a quick search of the gulf oil spill shows that the cleanup costs were 40-90 Billion. 

So does this means that the government is on the hook for cleanup costs above $1b? Again that really means that we are socializing risk and privatizing profit.

If these companies are on the hook for all costs then they're much more likely to invest in safety measures. But even then safety measures must be regulated. The gulf oil spill might have been prevented if they invested $1 million in a secondary drill site. 

Apparently $1 million is too much of a cost even if it could prevent up to 90 billion in damages. Not too many people are trained in risk mitigation but from the limited background I have in it I can tell you that that one is a no-brainer. And they still didn't do it.

So, if they were on the hook for any and all damages with regulated safety procedures only then will they take safety seriously. For those who say that they won't invest well then fine. Someone else will.

I get that the dancing is a bit too much for kids of that age but consider if you are a parent who has aspirations of your kid becoming a professional dancer, this the type of dancing professional dancers usually get paid to do.  From a practical standpoint it makes sense to train them to dance the way that most professional dancers get trained to dance.  Only people are are pedo's or on the fence about being pedo's will get dirty thoughts about it.  Would it make a difference if the girls were 12-13 instead?  At what age can you teach children how to dance (like they do in videos which is what the kids eventually want to learn to dance like)

TL;DR  If you want your kid to grow up and become a pro-dancer they will need to learn to dance like this eventually."

Lex's intelligence, by his nature as a Superman villain, is highly scientific to the point where the crap he events is practically science fiction. Bruce on the other hand is more of a polymath; someone whose expertise spans several fields. So while Bruce may be a brilliant scientist he isn't a child prodigy sort like Lex, who is generally portrayed as having been so intelligent that it isolated him from humanity as a child (In Birthright he wanted to meet Aliens so that he could have an intellectual equal). Along with that they are different sorts of wealthy as well. Bruce is old money since he inherited his fortune, while Lex's fortune is mostly self made.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391199950.0,"Ugh, somehow my first response to this got lost in my tabs when I went to search for a certain reddit comment explaining economic principles to you. So my original response to this post seems to be gone.

&gt;Being made in factories and transported is all part of production. When something is sold, it is not distributed, but exchanged. There is no separate ""distribution"" phase on a free market, thus is it entirely inaccurate to call government theft and allotment ""re""distribution.

Can you explain the relevance here. It seems to me you're playing a word game.

&gt;Sometimes? Where else does it get stuff to give others?

Alternatively it can print money, but this is inflationary.

&gt;If you see Michael Jordon's face on a Wheaties box, do you declare that you should ""give unto Michael's what is Michael's"". Jesus was being asked a trick question planned, and he gave a trick answer.

And it seems you're intentionally being obtuse so that you may dodge the point altogether. But as I said in my other response, maybe you should really rethink who owns what.

&gt;It's ""correct"" that I steal what you produce! Parasitism has a higher claim than production!

In some situations, yes it does. Because poor people need to eat too.

&gt;Ah man, I didn't know you were psychic too! I can't compete with that! Tell me, how does my love life look in the future? I mean, clearly you can't read my palms over the internet, but can you break out some tarot cards or something?

Idk man, I don't think it looks good because most women are statists. /snarky response to a snarky response

&gt;I already said what jobs would be created: jobs in the industries that see an increased demand that are now available as cost has been reduced by the increase in capital. That's how it's worked for 10,000 years of human history, and it's not stopping now.

Can you name these fields? Because they all look high skilled and would require advanced degrees to me. Care to elaborate beyond citing abstract economic theory?

&gt;Right. And that doesn't happen in capitalism. The use of coercion being banned is the defining feature of a free market. Government, on the other hand, only knows how to use force to get it's way because it doesn't respect the rights of others and is too simple to be able to convince other people to voluntarily follow its ways by the powers of persuasion.

Who bans it? 

Also, where do rights come from?

&gt;It's not a ""perspective"", it's science.

There's a difference between science and perspective. You're correct, economics is science, but it's a science oversimplified by ancaps, who think the abstract models of econ 101 explain everything accurately. It also ignores the fact that there's a difference between the consequences in economics and the values. Ancaps VALUE market efficiency, whereas I don't necessarily do so. Sometimes I think market intervention is necessary to create positive externalities for society. Sure, this comes at the cost of efficiency at times, but sometimes you just need to decide that which is more important. I'm sorry, but you don't get to walk around with a monopoly of truth and tell everyone how wrong and ignorant they are. The world is more complex, and multifaceted than given credit for.

&gt;You're expressing the same economic fallacies that were utterly disproven back in the 1800's. You very clearly don't.

Ok, let me give you a certain ""best of"" post I came across recently to explain what I'm trying to get at in a better way than I might be able to do so.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391200160.0,"&gt; I think there are some native americans that might disagree with that statement. The government did not obtain it's territory by homesteading or contract, but by force, as all governments do. And, coincidentally, how all mafia gangs do. Or maybe you think Al Capone really does just let those shopkeepers use his land which he needs to charge them for protection for.

Apparently you never heard of the Louisiana purchase. You know. Where we PAID another country via voluntary transaction for half our country. Also, unless you're a native american, you're living on someone else's stolen land and you're missing the entire point, by your own admission, I'm going to guess you really don't own crap.

EDIT: Let's go even deeper than that.

I'd like you to watch this somewhat comical video about the land ownership of the land of Israel.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-evIyrrjTTY

Now, how would you resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Who does the land belong to? people have been killing each other over land since the beginning of time. And honestly, it would be insanely difficult to give land to the descendents of the original owners, because over thousands of years, land ownership is fluid. Many, many people have ""legitimate"" claims to ownership over land over thousands of years. Who deserves the land?

Maybe we should get rid of this petty concept of ownership? Because this concept might be disfunctional. But then how do we decide who can use what? We can't have no rules, after all. Well, that makes ownership a concession of reality. But who decides ownership? Well, I think a state is the best way to decide ownership. Which means the state ultimately owns the land, but they have given you the right to build a house on the land that you ""own"". That's right, the US government has granted you the right to use your own land. How about that! Ownership is a social construction that allows us to orderly control and use the land that we live on! It's not some set in stone sacred right. It's what we construct!"

Namely, they're nixing his sustain altogether if I recall correctly, and they're shifting his slow to his Fracture, which kills your level 1 aggression strategy.

Beyond that, if we're thinking of the current status of things, it's that he'll burn himself out at level 1 aggression. Being a mana reliant champion in toplane is a liability in and of itself when you consider how dominant Renekton, Mundo and Shyvana have been. Even other mana users like Trundle have more reasonable MP costs and more reliable sustain. It won't work for the same reason Hecarim top isn't very successful: Mana cost on sustain AND aggression is obscene and you need both to be dominant against the aforementioned opponents. This factor won't let you win before the first recall if your opponent is smart.

Skarner gets very scary late game, especially with a Sheen upgrade and some health, but getting there against a competent opponent should be difficult. I've run into Skarner top twice in Platinum, once as Wukong and once as Renekton, and I shredded him both times. "

Because this is a very, very difficult situation to be in. There's so many factors that go into it, that yes, children can very seriously be hurt by this. The parents always have more power in these situations, it's **never** equal even if both people are consenting because one person provides food &amp; shelter and obviously has the upper hand due to that.

Arlieth,DataHoarder,1391200313.0,"He's using FreeNAS which gives him RAID Z2 capability (equivalent to RAID 6 but with additional redundancy features), and he's not using it for write-heavy databases so RAID 10 is an unnecessary waste of capacity for the use of the array.

What concerns me is the 4TB drives. Larger drives have an astronomically high resilver/rebuild time which increases URE (unrecoverable read error) from OTHER drives, and a bad MTBF rate (mean time before failure). Even a mirrored set will trigger total failure of the array/pool if its mirrored drive fails.

OP should switch to 2TB drives on RAID Z2 to compensate for the reduced capacity as opposed to 4TB drives on RAID 10."

2. What is wrong with you that you aren't able to talk to/seduce women your own age? I always think guys who prey on young girls have issues with women. Small penis, nervousness, inadequacy issues, whatever. Like, why do you need to talk to women who have limited to no sexual experience.

We do have tons of customers wandering the lot most Sundays though. Everyone knows it's the best time to look at the cars without having to talk to a salesperson.

Maybe he sees that you're busy often and he feels like he's interrupting what you're supposed to be doing. (I've done this with my SO.)

My advice would be to initiate some texting with him. Ask what he's up to, say ""we haven't be texting as often this week, have you been busy?"" or ""I miss our afternoon text chats"" Don't send 10 texts without a response, that's what looks clingy.

It's what a bad person does. It might make you a sale, but it also makes you an asshole. Are you arguing the asshole point? Or are you saying that trp is a guide to assholedom?

To be clear: I believe that trp is a community of assholes who are continuously trying to deny that they're assholes. If you'll admit that trp is a guide to being an asshole, I guess you'll technically prove me wrong.

&gt; But how do we know the ""unsuspecting buyers"" are of high moral character, and that we should feel sorry for them. 

I... Uh... really?

Dude, if you have any reason at all to think they're bad people, that's one thing. Treating a bad person like shit *might* be acceptable. But... you're saying, if you don't know the customer, you feel perfectly justified selling him shit, based on the *chance* that they *might* be bad people?

Is that your mindset with women? That you're allowed to fuck them because they might be bad people, and, if they are, they deserve the punishment of having to put up with your sorry ass?

&gt; That ""couple that never makes good on deals"" deserves to get screwed in life, because by renegging on contracts, they are screwing others.

But... they're not the ones getting screwed. The ones getting screwed are the ones that actually buy this crap. By your explanation, the Niborgs (or however you spell their name)... would they be good people if they signed the contract and kept it, and paid for the shit property, and got themselves screwed over? What about Jim, that poor guy who Ricky spends 20 minutes trying to talk back into the deal--is he a bad guy? What in the world makes you think that? Just that it might make it acceptable that Ricky was trying to fuck him?

Drakkanrider,sex,1391201076.0,"Please don't listen to that guys advice, he's not only wrong he's also pushing some harmful ideas about male sexuality.  Men don't necessarily want sex all the time and there are tons if lower libido men out there that are seriously harmed by this stereotype.  Instead of thinking ""he's a man and I'm attractive, therefore something must be seriously wrong if he doesn't want sex all the time,"" you should be taking the same advice given to high libido partners on thus subreddit all the time.

Being tired isn't something you prioritize in your life, it's a negative consequence of things like stress.  Its something that gets in the way of sex, not because you think being tired is more important but because being tired makes it so, so much harder to get in the mood, especially for a low libido person.  This is something that you need to understand and work around.  I'm a low libido partner myself, and I have been through times when tiredness, depression, and stress made me not want to have sex at all.  I love sex, I love how it makes me feel and I love how it makes my partner feel.  But it's a lot of work, and if you're not in the mood it's just more stress added on to what you're already dealing with.

You can't just jump his bone when he gets home from work.  I'm not great at analogies, but say you love going to the zoo.  Its one of your favorite things to do.  Do you want to go straight from work to the zoo every night? Probably not.  As the higher libido partner, a lot of the onus is on you to get your partner in the mood.  Going straight for his dick after no warm up us just going to be annoying.  Different people have different ways of relaxing enough to be able to get in the mood, and you will probably need to help him with this.  Sit down and eat dinner together, cuddle, kiss, hug, give him a massage, whatever works.  Please don't see being tired as a bad excuse or a lie, it is a legitimate libido-killer."

I prefer lady gynos because the incidence of sausage fingers in the female population tends to be lower than in the male population.

MoonRazer,leagueoflegends,1391201202.0,"I mained lux for months, she's by far my favorite mid laner. 

The E cd is long because you have a 5(?) second period before you have to trigger it and the cd starts from the initial cast not the detonation. It's actually quite a short cd if you zone with it instead of instantly detonating it (which you better be doing). 

As for her Q, it has to be a long cd early game since it has such a long lvl 1 snare. It's really the start of her passive-proc combo when you go in for the kill (similar to Ahri's charm) and you will be punished for missing it.

By the time you hit mid game and get 40% CDR though, all her abilities have ridiculously low cool downs. Her ult cd is 30s at max lvl&amp;CDR, which is great for its damage and range.

Just zone with your E and never leave a passive un-proced and you won't really even notice the early cool downs. "

You keep saying that but this conversation is not about you. Nowhere in the discussion was I ever suggesting that you give anyone anything and I'm not really a member of the aggrieved party in this situation anyway.

I even explicitly said that throwing money at the problem wouldn't help it.

&gt;Nor will I willingly give you anything

That is one of the most paranoid statements I've seen in this thread. I literally can't tell if you're being direct or general

&gt;I do think it would be ineffective to say throw a few hundred million at the problem and expect everything to be right

The point is that the legacy of slavery is real. The only goal here is to get that acknowledged instead of swept under the rug like it was the past and therefore irrelevant. I would argue that TA-slavery was one of the most important incidents in modern history.

What to do about it is above my paygrade. I'm just trying in this thread to get us to step one. The same page. TA-Slavery was bad, so bad it's ripples are STILL being felt."

Sorry, I just can't relate. I went out and met men until I clicked with one, I didn't wait for anything to fall in my lap. And in almost two years of dating this man I have rejected having sex with him maybe twice. He rejects sex more than I do. 

I think you're talking about traditionalist societies where women's sexuality was tightly controlled regardless of their own personal desires (societies which are on the way out). Women have more worth in the world than just as sex providers and are now able to enjoy sex with fewer consequences so there's no real need or benefit gained to thinking of sex in those terms- unless you want to be a prostitute (which is fine, but the majority of women and men choose to work in offices instead). 

I mean, I enjoy sex largely because it is an aspect of my life that does NOT relate to any kind of economic or trading situation. I feel that even if I must make some choices in life based on economics and cost/benefit ratios I sure as hell want to follow my own desires where sex is concerned and leave all of what you are discussing out of it. I won't let that silly bullshit touch the haven of emotional and sexual delights that I wish to develop in my free time. That kind of thinking is for the workplace and business transactions. My vagina is an awesome organ of pleasure that I get to share, not a carrot on a stick I use to get men to jump through hoops for me. 

And it isn't as if men are all avaricious beings with no motivation other than having as much sex as they can. Men can and do choose not to have sex with women who do want to have sex with them. "

Sometimes I spread my arms wide and seal off the rest of the house as she moves around doing her 'leaving the house routine'.  As she moves closer to the door I advance and block her from moving back into the house.  Eventually I have her penned in near the front door and she's telling me all the stuff she forgot to do at the back of the house and I tell her it will still be there when we get home and we leave.

How many lies did Ricky tell Jim? He tried to trick him at first, by pretending Shelley was a smart, and rich customer, and that he had to run, and couldn't stick around, sorry. But Jim wasn't taking no for an answer. He was a nervous and quiet guy, but he wanted out, so he did not let Ricky leave. The guy brings up the 3-day grace period required by the law, and Ricky says it'll last until he ""gets back"" on Monday--even though the math obviously ends that three day period on Friday. Jim is sweating here--Ricky is pushing him, and clearly doesn't want to let him out of the deal, but Jim knows he has to get out. So he says he's just going to go to the attorney, and Ricky lies one more time, and says that he'll tear up the check. If Williamson hadn't fucked it all up, Jim would be stuck in a piece of shit vacation property.

LadyCatTree,Pets,1391201644.0,"I know this isn't everyone's opinion but I personally think it'd be a little cruel to get a cat and then keep it cooped up in an apartment. If you're really desperate for a cat then I would at least go to a shelter and ask specifically whether they have any indoor cats, who can't go out for medical reasons or whatever.


Additionally - if you let your bunnies roam free, even just within one room, then you're taking a big risk by introducing a predator to the home. I have a 7 month old kitten and he's a slippery little fuck who gets into everything. Your house looks pretty open plan - how are you planning to prevent kitty from making a dash for the rabbits every time you need to open the door to their room? Cats are quick, and they will see a rabbit as something to chase and kill, not as a fellow pet. They'll be pretty interested in the ferrets too.


I know the feeling of really wanting a cat, we got our boy after many months of thinking about it and looking forward to it. It can be very rewarding! But I personally don't think you're in a great position to have a cat right now, what with the apartment and the other pets. Plus, a cat is a big time commitment. They want fussing and playing with, especially if they can't go outside, and a long haired girl like the one you're after will need brushing on a daily basis. You're already working, in school, and looking after four other animals. Are you sure you're not going to be overloading yourself?"

The sketch itself is an interior design of a tavern, built into the chancel of an abandoned monastery. It's a setting for a game I've been developing for quite some time - slowly, and off and on, because it's a text-based multiplayer game (think MUDs) built around cooperative storytelling that very few people aside from myself would want to play. But, since I want to play it myself, I've been chipping away at it between work and art school. For the sake of motivation, most of my paintings are related to it too.

spryte333,AskReddit,1391201828.0,"There's this thing called Buggy at the college I just graduated from. It only happens there, and I had to stop because of the whole graduating thing, but it's easily one of the most fun things I've ever done. This is pretty biased, since I got to do what is arguably the funnest job, as well as being able to help out with the next most fun, but still. It was great, and even though I'm done participating, I'm looking forward to being an active alum, and getting new people as excited for it as I am/was.

Now for an actual description. There's a big hill, then a downhill part, then another large hill. That all makes a semi-loop of paved road. Buggy takes that course, and uses it to combine a relay race and soapbox derby, with a tiny person steering a tiny tube through the downhill bit (as well as the straighter hills). And there's lots of teams that do this, and they have a big race every year during the schools pre-finals crazy week called Carnival (which is a whole different thing). I got to drive, and for a few years, I also got to help design/build/maintain my team's buggies. I made a few friends in my major in school, but most of my actual close friends are from that buggy team. I can go on and on about buggy (my family knows not to ask unless they want the full rundown), but fun people doing fun things together is just so darn easy to be passionate about. Plus, I've never heard of anything else quite like it, so I get to feel a little special.

[](/sp)

Anyone who is interested in reading any more about buggy, there's a great website run by the alumni. It's got trash talking, news about the current year's practice, vaguely related things, and of course, pictures and videos. Here's a link to the ""What is Buggy"" section, and feel free to explore the rest of the site too. http://cmubuggy.org/reference/What_is_buggy%3F"

**photos**

You really need more/better pictures.. preferably some taken by someone else..   And in at least half of those pictures please avoid wearing a white t shirt underneath which can be seen.

Do you keep your luxurious beard year round?  If, not make sure to add pictures when you next shave it or change it's shape.

**self-summary**

mostly you seem to be putting up every defense against having to summarize yourself.   reading books, playing games and having esoteric discussions are things you do, not who you are.  Nerdy is a start, but it's also a really huge brush to paint yourself with.

Your choices of books and movies point to a person with greater depth and breadth than ""nerdy type gamer"" captures.. give it another shot or try spit balling some options in the comments here.. 

**What I'm doing with my life**

Not a bad start.. it explains your current place in life.. it's January, what direction are you hoping to go this June?   Are you applying to graduate schools?   Have you interned anyplace and do you hope to get a permanent job there?   Do you want to program games, join a start up, create a startup of your own, slide into a cubical in corporate America so you can coast at the office and have a fun life outside of work?

**really good at**

What board games?  

What's the most challenging thing you've cooked successfully?

*someone else to taste test it on. * either someone to taste test it, or someone to test it on, not both.  I recommend to taste test it.  Someone to test it on sounds more mad scientists than cook.

**first thing**

The beard's a selling point.. or a red flag for ladies who feel too much facial hair becomes a way to hide.  Awkward demeanor may be accurate but is not a great selling point.

**Favorites**

Nice formatting/use of white space.. music might need a paragraph break or trim it down a bit since things start to look crowded there.

**Six**

Nice.. I'm becoming a fan of six lists that include why.

**thinking**

Nice.. and good way of envisioning it.  Any more hopeful thoughts?  

**Friday**

Nerdy computer guy list to be sure.. any way you can spice it up or add details that it make it the flavor of nerdy computer guy that is *you*?

**private thing**

Obviously from my opening comments.. I like this section.  Blankey is cute too, will it move to a dresser in your own house/apartment when you've got one?

**Message Me if**

Not terrible, not amazing.. spruce up the rest and this can stay.

**Overall**

fairly hit and miss.. I read this and feel unconvinced you're really looking as much as it seems like you feel you should be looking so put this out there to show you are.

It reads a little defensive of your nerd self instead of embracing your nerd self and looking for a nerdette to fall in love with.   You need to share more about yourself and yet balance that with leaving enough on the table that she's got questions to ask after reading your profile.

2. Let's say that Knicks' Brass is stupid, debatable, and they decided to trade Melo for all the first round picks the Clippers have for the next 1,3,5 years and exchanges for the other 2. They still need to grab salary as both teams are capped out. That means either a trade for Jordan + 2 wings or Jordan + every player who makes less than 4 mil or literally every good wing the Clippers have. In any case the Clippers can't afford to lose that many players.
3. Finally like 10 other teams could offer a better deal. 

So unless your friend thinks the Clippers trade their up and coming all star on a pretty good contract for paying Melo max money next year this isn't going to happen."

duffmanhb,facepalm,1391202021.0,"I loosely remember my time in Germany. I met some other American's earlier in the day and decided to join them for their bar crawl. We eventually end at this beach type club/bar in some remote section filled with tons of people. However, it's now 9 AM and I don't know how these people do it. I passed out right under this nice tree -- around noon I wake up in complete shock. There was literally a group of people around in a circle starting at the tree with me in the middle. 

So my last memory was in complete exhaustion with 4 friends while I close my eyes to take a nap. I woke up to a good 15 people all staring at me while I freak the hell out trying to make sense of the situation. One dude, a 6'2'' German man gayer than the rainbow, quickly realizes my state of I'm obviously extremely confused. So he let's me know that my friends had to leave but they didn't want to wake me, so instead they all offered to look over me while I slept. It obviously was a little strange considering the fact that it was now clear that most of the people around me were obviously on MDMA and way too into the fact that I was awake. But I digress. 

I end up taking the underground back home only to find out that I must have left my keys back at the beach club. So I pull out my phone to call a local locksmith that can figure out how to open up these magical doors. When I pulled out my phone the camera app was open, which is odd, so I decided to check my photos only to find a bunch of pictures I have absolutely no recollection of taking. Such as [this](http://imgur.com/xVlI5q6) and [this](http://imgur.com/UhLmdKq). Interestingly enough, these are two entirely separate locations, one of which I've never actually been to.

figgernaggots,hockey,1391202089.0,"Well since you're a Spurs/Packers fan I'm guessing you're used to or you like seeing your team be a powerhouse (or close) every year.  Also probably don't mind not having superstar (like face of the league type) players as long as the team gets the job done?  

Anyways sounds like you'd like a team like the Blues: good, defensive team game, good for the past ~5 years and only getting better, none of their players can be considered ""best in the world"" class but definitely a very, very strong team.  Only problem is lack of history I guess and not having won any Cups.  

Also the Sharks are pretty damn good every year and have some old guys (Marleau, Thornton) who are awesome but their young core (Couture, Pavelski kinda, Hertl) looks promising and I can only imagine they're going to stay a top team for the foreseeable future.  They also have awesome jerseys.

Honestly I want you to be a Devils fan: probably the most successful team of the past 2 decades, minus the Red Wings, team game, no superstars (anymore...lol), great history with one of the greatest goalies of all time who's still playing at 41 (but not very well), one of the greatest players of all time also playing at age 41.

Racism is, as you said, a discrimination by a more 'priveleged' race against one eithout that privelege. Prejudice is the same except without the privilege component (at least thats what Ive learned).

I hope that helps even though I'm not a sociologist...I'd say just to take her answer as thr ""right"" one since shr has a PhD in the subject...it probably comes across as hurtful/offensive to her too.

If that casket is airtight (which with it being home made probably isn't) the body would still decompose, just from the inside out. Think about it! Even with cavity fluid in the abdomen there are still bacteria that break down and want to help the body become fluid and mush! Another thing to consider is the incredible weight put on the casket/Box. it would probably last at most a few months before being crushed by dirt and gravity. Hope you learned something today!"

Have you tried positive reinforcement (giving reasons that hanging out would be a good way to spend time) rather than negative (calling the guy a ""bitch"" for refusing to do what you want)?

In addition, that particular use is pretty much the point of some of the people in the debate higher in the thread: by using it in such a manner, you're implying that being female (""bitch"" is primarily a female insult) is lesser, bad, and undesirable.

SublethalDose,socialskills,1391202439.0,"&gt; I just assumed that she was going to pretend like she didn't know who I was when the current semester started up.

That's childish behavior that everyone outgrows eventually.  Neither of you did anything offensive to damage the friendly relationship you had before.  If you had strong feelings towards her, it might be understandable for you to avoid each other while your emotions were still raw, but since you didn't express any strong feelings, there's no reason for you not to continue interacting as you did last semester.

&gt; I'm not sure if this means she's giving me another chance or if I've been put into the ""friend zone"".

I really hate that term.  It goes hand-in-hand with the stereotype of men thinking that friendliness implies sexual interest and feeling cheated when it does not.  The ""friend zone"" is not a special hell that women invent to emasculate unwanted admirers; it's where 99% of people are with 99% of everyone else.  The phenomenon of a woman being friendly towards a man she doesn't want to sleep with is utterly normal and does not deserve to be pathologized with a scare-quoted name.

So, don't be that stereotypical guy who believes that a woman's generic friendliness towards him calls into doubt her clear indications that she isn't interested in him sexually.

That doesn't mean you shouldn't try asking her out again, though.  You only asked her out once, and that was almost two months ago.  Just don't feel like she's jerking you around if she says no again.  Being friendly isn't a come-on.

Why do we need two elected federal houses? Why do we even need two houses at all?  How would you abolish parties? Parties just arise naturally as alliances among groups with aligned interests.

Personally I think one elected house is enough - elected officials behave very strangely and I don't think I want *more* of them.

A lot of feminists are assholes, obviously. But so are a hell of a lot of MRAs. I don't see a reason why anyone should oppose the goal of feminism. The goal of feminism is gender equality. That's it. It's the same goal as men's rights. Some feminists have tried to warp that to accommodate their hate, just as many MRAs have warped the men's rights cause to accommodate THEIR hate.

Feminism is literally just the belief that sexism should not exist. It emphasizes women because historically and currently, women have borne the brunt of global sexism. But that doesn't mean it opposes men's issues. In fact, feminists work hard to let men gain privileges that are traditionally female: being able to teach young children, having a good chance of winning custody battles, and not having to be drafted.

Judging feminism by its radicals, and believing that it opposes men, is as generalizing and untrue as saying ""white people hate Black people."""

It astonishes me that when I show people what I am, they sometimes advise that I seek help. That I'm sad or quiet doesn't mean I'm depressed. That I wander doesn't mean I'm lost. This doesn't make me feel like there's something wrong with me, though. It used to, but it doesn't now. 

You sound like such a sensitive and interesting person, I'm glad I got to see a little glimpse of your thoughts. And with regard to what you said earlier about the ""infinite abyss"" to which I prefer to refer to as The Absolute: I too felt the pressure to read and know everything, but I try to free myself from that. You see, in my opinion there are pieces of art, literature, music, conversations, which touch deep upon our soul, which allow us a tiny glimpse, a taste of this Absolute. And these are those which matter. I don't mind if my life is such patchwork of these moments. I just relax and flow downstream. Well, mostly. Sometimes I get desperate, because there is so little time and so much of everything, but this probably isn't a place to bare my existential fears. "

Furthermore, by your adjusted standard in this comment, people shouldn't judge a child molester (or the situation), if ""no one is hurt"".  If a 6 month old is molested with no physical pain, can we really conclude that the child was ""hurt"".  If a woman is raped while unconcious and has no idea that the rape ever occurred, is she ""hurt"" by the rape?  I would contend that, in either of those situations, the victim is not ""hurt"" by any conventional sense of the word.  Would you still contend that we should not judget the perpetrator of these acts because (a) we've never committed those acts ourselves so we have no right to judge and (b) no one was hurt by the acts, so there is no judging to be done.

FatMatti,CanadaPolitics,1391202868.0,"One important thing to note about this is that the reports are unverified. Data collection occurs all the time, especially when logging on to wifi networks or websites that have the ""terms of service"" that everyone automatically clicks ""I agree"" to without reading. Sites use this information for targeted advertisements, whereas CESC (presumably) is using data collection for location tracking. Personally I don't think this is a big deal given that it has been happening for years already. Plus, if you haven't done or aren't planning on doing anything that would be considered a breach of national security, why worry?

And this may totally not be what's going on, but a lot of women, especially really young women, tend to have ""little girl"" weddings - you know, that whole ""I've dreamed of this since I was a little girl"".  

Weddings are just super weird and people are super weird about weddings.  When I was doing my planning, I routinely saw people posting things like, ""I told my best friend when I was 4 that she would be my maid of honor, but my best friend now - who saved my life when I was drowning - is going to be hurt if I don't ask her.  What do I do?""  People lose their minds.  So much insignificant crap gets blown out of proportion.

I know this seems incredibly important, but honestly, this is just a really expensive party in the grand scheme of her life and yours.  The wedding is insignificant compared to the marriage and the life.  The friendships we make as adults will always take a backseat to our adult lives and that may already be the case for her, as it kind of should be if she's been in a deeply committed relationship with someone for the past couple of years, enough to be getting married now.

She asked you, for reasons you don't have to know or agree with.  If you are able to manage whatever responsibilities go with it (and those are deeply cultural, so ask her and her mother) and you want to do this, do it for her because that's what she wants."

Don't take this as some sort of critique or suggestion, it's just intended as an idle reflection on your story: I think the key thing here is that the best example you are setting for your kids here is that the high ground is between pointless fighting and passively yielding to a bully.

Myself, I've dated people at both extremes. One girlfriend always wanted to have these huge emotional fights and hated that I don't raise my voice, ever. (I learned early never to raise my voice... I'm 6'4"" and was that way when I was fifteen years old. People get scared. I don't like that.) The other girlfriend never stood up for herself for any reason, and it was like crafting a relationship out of wet paper and hoping it will dry out before it collapses.

I think we've got to stick up for what's important to us, but I agree that being hurtful or rude or mean is pretty much never the right way to go.

So I wasn't allowed back in the house after inpatient treatment.

The nurse practitioner did the right thing. I know you feel betrayed, but she did the right thing. It may take you some time and growing up to realize this. This is an amazing opportunity for you to get some more intense help with your mental illness. It won't take long at all for you to realize this if you keep an open mind.

Things like this happen for a reason. I wasn't ready to go to school when I was dealing with similar issues, but I went anyway and had a complete breakdown. The antidepressants, therapist, and psychiatrist didn't stop the near-suicide attempt.

Everything will work out the way it's supposed to. I kept an open mind, accepted help, and now I'm in school. I made the Dean's List last semester at my university. It took a lot of time before I was ready for that stage, but I'm thriving after ceasing my self-harm habits 3 years ago.

Yes. Snack sized meals will make a difference. Yes, the highest of metabolisms only burn ~200 more calories. What that means is people who say they are thin because of ""high metabolism"" just aren't eating as much as they think they are. They're eating AT their maintenece level. Weight gain or loss ultimately boils down to calories. You want to gain, eat at a surplus. You want to lose, eat at a deficit. It's a numbers game.

I don't understand what you mean by eating another 1000 calories not making a difference. 1000 calories is a world of difference.

If your ultimate goal is just pure weight gain, then just eat. It really doesn't matter what. Just count the calories. Figure out your TDEE.  Eat whenever possible. It doesn't matter what. Just be eating constantly. 

Eat when hungry. Eat when full. Eat when sick. Eat at work. Eat on break. Eat on the commute to work. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat.

Russian_Surrender,changemyview,1391203131.0,"&gt; It's totally unfair to judge someone for smoking weed if you have never tried it yourself 

But do you have to do something yourself to obtain a reasonable understanding of what it might be like?  Can't you observe others who do that thing and, based upon a collection of a sample size of observed behavior, conclude whether or not something is ""good"" or ""bad"" in whatever moral code guides you?

Take drunk driving.  Do I have to drive drunk myself to know that anyone who does it is a selfish douchbag?  Do I even have to drink or get drunk to make that assessment?  I would say no.  Even if I've never sipped alcohol myself, there is a sufficient collection of evidence - and a sufficient sample size - to conclude that drunk driving, if done enough, will eventually kill an innocent person.  And I can draw that conclusion without having any idea whatsoever it feels like to drink, be drunk, drive, or do any combination of those.

And just curious whether you extend your line of thinking to things you maybe disagree with.  How do you feel about ""gun nuts""?  Can you judge a ""gun nut"" without ever firing or owning a gun yourself?  How about religious leaders?  Can you judge them without ever being a religious leader yourself?  What about strippers, prostitutes or johns?  Can you judge them without ever being a stripper, prostitute or john yourself?"

The cost of the parachutes themselves, at several thousand dollars each, for a plane the size of a 747 would be enough to make it not worth it. But now the airlines need certified riggers at all of the airports that they go to. They need to inspect each parachute before each flight to make sure that nobody had tampered with them. The increased weight of all of the parachutes means less weight can be carried elsewhere, be it cargo or fuel. Or the plane will simply be heavier, which hurts fuel economy, further increasing the cost. Airlines save millions of pounds of fuel by doing little things like taking off with a lower flap setting, which decreases drag. There's a story about an airline saving tens of thousands of dollars by removing a single olive from their salads. Parachutes would negate all of that."

DCDVath,leagueoflegends,1391203250.0,"Yes that is true. You get to the promotion series quickly. But once you get into the series you could have a string of bad luck against the other gold players and lose. Why should someones promotion series be based on playing people way higher than where they are getting promoted to? If it's going to jump someone Silver 5 to Silver 3 then fine, place them against Silver 3 people. Don't make someone play Gold 3 people to get into Silver 3. Even if their MMR is at a Gold 3 level it's not fair to them. 

Sure with enough games you will finally get to where you should be. But the current system just makes it a frustrating road. That's the point being made here. It would make more sense to either

A. Put you against the people in the group you are getting promoted to, or

B. Allow you to jump straight to whatever players you were playing against when you won your series. So in my roomates case, if he plays against gold 3-4 players during his promotion out of bronze 1, he should go to Gold. The current system is going to place him in silver, which makes no sense.

If you are such a 'producer', then I want to live near you, end of story.  

The fear I have (and it may be completely unfounded) is that millions of 'illegals' will *not* add any more significant production (nor tax revenue), but will add billions of additional cost to welfare and healthcare expenses.  This sets up a situation where there is more consumption of resources than production, which to me, is a terrible terrible situation.

DJWikipedia,Android,1391203385.0,"Honestly, it wouldn't make a difference. There's already more than enough overhead in wireless N used at 2.4GHz to stream 1080p. If 2.4GHz is having issues it's doubtful that 5GHz would make that difference (assuming you are using the same quality between your 2.4 and 5GHz networks) unless your speed issue is really caused by the 2.4GHz channels being completely saturated.

It's the nature of wifi - it will never work at the advertised 300 Mbps that is advertised on the box of your consumer router. If you want to watch hi res content, get a Roku or something like that and wire it in.

&gt; It's not broken, it fits perfectly into ES Lore. Just like in the most recent ES game (Skyrim) anybody could join the Stormcloaks or the Imperials, not restricted by Race. So too should the races of ESO be allowed to join any faction they find ideologically suitable

Skyrim was a single player game so if you choose to you can either play following the lore or just play whatever makes you happy. Lore-wise a Argonian, Dunmer, Altmer, etc, wouldn't be able to join the Stormcloaks even if they wanted to. Seeing a hoard of Khajiit with the Ebonheart alliance will break immersion for a chunk of players.

Yes, it's very well possible for outside races to join a different alliance, that's not the issue. Considering the situation that influenced the provinces into forging alliances there's really not a problem of outside races joining (one could say there is an issue with men races joining the Aldmeri Do union because they think men races are unfit to rule), it's more an issue of how many outside races there are in the alliances.

&gt; First: I am going to say that a majority of players who have the option to switch factions, are not actually going to do it. I know that personally I am not going to, I am going to be right there with whatever faction my race is. The exception being if I rolled an alt and had 4 characters in Ebonheart pact, I might be tempted to switch the Khajiit (or whatever it might be) over to Ebonheart so that I can benefit from my work on the other characters.

You can't be sure that people will follow their race-related alliance. I personally think that a vast amount of players will play a race outside of their original alliance. There will be a good chunk of people who don't really care about the lore (which is perfectly fine) and players that are new to TES, these people will pick their favorite race and whichever alliance appeals to them the most.

""Bitch"" speaks to her actions. It's something she has 100% control over. She chose to act that way, and she's a damn adult. If an adult is abusive to another person, their actions should be condemned. That girl needs to learn that it's not socially acceptable to do what she did. "

soma16,AskReddit,1391203481.0,"When I was 9, my family moved to a brand new home in the suburbs outside Toronto. My new room was a perfect square when you walked in. If you stood in the doorway, my bed was centred to the wall across from the door. To the right of the door was a large window and to the left, next to the bed, was my dresser which had a large mirror on top. Leaving the room led to a hallway, which had it's own window to the left, a balcony next to the window almost directly across from my bedroom door and my parents/sister's room and the bathroom to the right.

Anyhow, I remember, one summer morning, waking up and getting dressed. From my mirror, you could perfectly see the window and balcony door in the hallway. While getting dressed I saw a woman with long black hair looking out the window. Thinking it was my mom (who also has black hair), I simply said ""Good morning mom!"" as any happy-go-lucky 9 year old would. I didn't get a response so I looked into the hallway and there was no one there. I figured she'd walked to her room or my sisters to put away laundry or dust like she usually did on the weekends. I called down the hall and still got no response. I eventually called down the stairs and found out my mom was loading laundry 2 floors below me in the basement. 

A few years later, I (being around 11 or 12 at the time) and my little sister (being around 2 or 3) were hanging out with my grandparents. My grandma put my sister down for her usual afternoon nap and came down to watch TV with me and my grandpa. My sister's room was directly above the living room. All of a sudden we heard the little pitter patter of footsteps above our heads. We figured we'd let her play around for a bit and see if she eventually settled down. It would stop and start up again every few minutes. Finally, my grandma had enough and went upstairs to check on her. She snuck up so she could catch my sister off guard. She swears to this day she heard footsteps coming from that room even as she walked up the stairs. When she opened the door, my sister was passed out cold in her bed. This was around the time that she had begun talking to ""imaginary friends"", so I was especially freaked out.

A couple months later, me and my friend were hanging out in my room playing guitar. Suddenly my door slammed shut, similar to how a door closes when someone leaves a window open. We thought nothing of it, assuming one of the windows was probably just open. But then, the door opened. This was a door that had to have the knob twisted. It couldn't be pushed or pulled open by any air pressure. We immediately freaked out and high-tailed it outside.

It got to a point where I would see a figure out of the corner of my eye, watching me at the top of the stairs or down the hall. There was a constant feeling of being watched in that home. The basement was the absolute worst. It felt not only that you were being watched, but that you were unwanted there. My dog absolutely refused to go down there. The day that we moved out of the house (I was around 15), my parents sent me down to retrieve some stuff from the basement. I just felt this unbelievable sense of dread, like whatever was down there did not want me taking what was left of the stuff in the basement. I booked it out of there as soon as I got the last of it. 

My family has come to the conclusion that the figure we'd see in the hallway and on the stairs is that of my great grandmother, watching over us, we didn't see that figure specifically until we put her picture up in the hallway and we've seen a similar figure in each of the homes we've lived in since then (we've hung her picture up in each subsequent house). We still get that feeling of being watched, but it doesn't feel menacing, which is reassuring.

Other than that, to this day (I'm 21 now) I have no fucking explanation for what was going on in that house. It was brand new, so nothing really should have been haunting it, unless the grounds themselves were haunted. All I know is, I never felt comfortable in that house."

Russian_Surrender,changemyview,1391203905.0,"I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here.  Are you saying that religion should never be presented to children and that they should be left to their own devices as to whether or not they stumble across it some day?  Or are you simply saying that children should be able to choose whether they want to follow a particular religion or not?

Because if it is the second one, then that is how things are and always will be and cannot possibly be changed.  People have free will.  People have the choice to believe what they want to believe.  A parent can drag their kid to church every Sunday, bible study on Wednesday night and the volunteer mission every Saturday.  They can read the bible to the child every night for an hour, pray before every meal, before bed and when they wake up in the morning.  They can watch The Passion of The Christ every Easter and The Ten Commandments every Christmas.

But after all of that, **it is still the child's choice what they want to believe**.  And nothing can change that.  Every thing a person does (other than basic human functions like breathing) from the moment they are born to the moment they die is the result of a choice that person made.  And that include actual actions that they take that affect other people.  You're just talking about a **belief** here that has no impact on any other person.  How could their belief possibly be anything other than their own decision?"

dublos,OkCupid,1391204010.0,"**photos**

You only have one, you're not in focus, the falls aren't in focus, and you're wearing a shapeless t shirt that makes what of your figure is visible look decidedly rectangular.  You've got a pretty/friendly smile and I'm guessing you clean up pretty well, but really I can't tell.  And.. that one picture is outdoors on a hike yet *I dislike camping and rock climbing.*

For your main photo my recommendation is that you be dressed/groomed as though you're about to leave to meet a prospective OKC date that you are looking forward to.

Beyond that have at least 4 total pictures, do not wear reflective sunglasses or other apparel/accessories that hide your face.   At least one of those should be full length because nobody knows what average looks like.

**Self-Summary**

I don't have anything against lists, but items on this list need to shift to other sections and you need to come up with a new list that is more about Who You Are instead of what you like, what you do, and where you've been.   Possible jumping off point: You comment on your ancestry only in the negative, what, if any,  aspects of your heritage do you embrace?

**What I'm doing with my life**

It's not even a list, it's got enthusiasm, and it actually is about what you're doing with your life.. Good!

**Good at**

Good thing to be good at.. feels a little bare, but I'm not sure elaboration is necessary.   Maybe one or two concrete things you're good at?  Any Hobbies?  

**Favorite things**

Why is Food not in your list?   I really see this as an opportunity for a potential date to imagine themselves with you somewhere.. At the very least a cuisine, at best add a couple of favorite dishes, and a favorite restaurant or two.

**Six things** 

Half way there.. but the three you have.. nicely put.  Come on this is the second essay that's meant to be a list and you can only find 3?

**thinking**

I like it.

**Friday night**

Not bad.. again a spot in your profile a potential date can imagine themselves out with you.. you've done a nice job of providing options for them to fit themselves into.

**Message me**

How frequently is *often*, do you want to be out 4 nights out of 7, or do you want to be out at least once in a given week?   Are you putting that there to avoid couch potatoes who just want to stay home and watch something on NetFlix with you?

Clarification could help readers know whether to disqualify themselves or whether that's a level of outings they are also looking for.

**Overall**
I think you got into the groove about half way through but didn't go back and puzzle through the ever difficult self-summary enough.

Malthus describes a closed system. If Britain had closed the ports, the famine would have taken place due to the conditions in that closed environment: the population had exceed its food supply.  The fact that it could be mitigated by using the resources of the wider world doesn't argue against it being a Malthusian event. Evidence of mis-management of agricultural resources also doesn't matter, because Malthus isn't talking about the maximum possible productivity of the land, but the amount of productivity which can be achieved *now* - the assumption of future growth in production is baked in to the theory.

In respect of your first point, I recently came across a pre-famine (1818) essay referring to the potato as the ""curse of Ireland"". The essayist did not refer to the dangers of a monoculture or disease, but made the point that families were expanding to the limit of what their land would support, and that this would lead to famine. 

I think what brought this home to me particularly was touring in Donegal (the north-west of the Republic) a few years back. The land there is of very poor quality - worse than the hill faming area in England where I grew up. I was struck by how high the population density is even now: many times the density of my own home dale. I can't work out how this is viable now, but it's quite a bit lower than in pre-famine days."

mfranko88,southpark,1391204153.0,"For South Park's 200th episode, the creators went all out and pulled from their history all kinds of fan service jokes and plots and combined them together. They also went for some of their most controversial stories as well, including the Mohammad censorship storyline from four years prior, from the episodes (Cartoon Wars)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon_Wars_Part_I]. The nexus of this controversy comes from extremist Muslims who refuse to see Mohammad depicted in any way - drawing, film, painting, etc. For these people, that is forbidden. And so whenever that happened, Comedy Central was faced with several death threats and other terrorism.

So Stone and Parker brought Mohammad back into the storyline for the 200th (and subsequent 201st) episode. It was rather meta, because the storyline itself was about how nobody was allowed to make fun of Mohammad. In short, several groups of people wanted to get ahold of Mohammad so that they could extract his ability to not be made fun of. Groups included famous celebrities led by Tom Cruise, and a group of gingers.

The entire episode 201, Mohammad is on screen, but Comedy Central had a large black censor bar over him. He is never seen directly. At the end of the episode, in traditional South Park fashion, the characters have a brief monologue about what they learned today. The entirity of that monologue was censored. 45 seconds of ""beeeeeeeeeeeeeeep"".

So, in short, 201 is South Park's most controversial episode in a long long line of controversy. "

blodpest,sweden,1391204189.0,"Vilken ryggdunkartråd detta är. Antar att jag kan förvänta mig en nedröstningshär av Guds nåde nu men ska skriva några av de saker jag tycker är negativt med V:

* Vinster i välfärden. Vänsterpartiet anser att grundbulten i företagandet inte är applicerbar i vården men i andra sektorer. Det är ett argument jag på riktigt inte kan förstå. Jonas Sjöstedt säger att det är skillnad på att bygga sjukhuset och att driva sjukhuset när det gäller rätt till vinst och att det borde man förstå själv. Jag är ekonom, så jag kanske är under intelligenssnittet, men snälla förklara för mig skillnaden mellan att plocka ut vinst i t.ex. vägarbeten och att plocka ut vinst i välfärden. Jag utgår från att det finns ett kvalitetsargument här, men det är i så fall väldigt konstigt om kvalitén inte är viktig för Sjöstedt när det gäller att spendera skattemedel i andra anseenden.

* 6 timmars arbetsdag. Argumentet Sjöstedt förde fram senast i riksdagens partiledardebatt är att det historiskt sett har fungerat när man lagstadgat om arbetstid och därför ska det fungera igen. Inte fel i sig, men historiskt sett har skattesänkningar fungerat för att få tillväxt och ändå har Vänsterpartiet snart i åtta år stått och skanderat mot alliansens skattesänkningar. Ska man inte vara konsekvent? Här har vänsterpartiet rent strategiskt satt sig i en svår sits, 6 timmars arbetsdag är ett förslag som kan nermejas totalt av en duktig retoriker (jag är inte en sådan) och få partiet att framstå som ett sandlådeparti, men samtidigt är det beslutat på stämman att partiet ska driva frågan. Kommer bli en intressant fortsättning.


Saker som Sjöstedt gör bra är ju att han är en passionerad antirasist och duktig på att bemöta SD-argument som bygger på kalla (och ofta felaktiga) fakta och siffror med med argument med solidaritet och andra klassiska socialistiska värderingar. Det gör honom svår att komma åt för SD, SD kan nämligen inte prata om ideologi eftersom deras ideologi... ja ni förstår. 

Hur tror jag det kommer gå i valet? svinbra. Jag tror det finns en möjlighet att Sjöstedt kammar hem upp mot 10%. Sverige behöver komma från att alla partier ska fiska mittenväljaren enligt medianväljarteoremet och det finns en stark befolkningsgrupp som efterfrågar ett parti som vänstern när S flirtar mer och mer åt höger. Och det är just de väljarna som Sjöstedt kommer ta, Vänstern känns spontant inte som ett parti som en blockbytare väljer, de tar nog ett inkörsportparti i vänsterblocket istället. "

DuneBug,leagueoflegends,1391204247.0,"pink wards justify their cost by never expiring. If that ward lasts for 6 minutes, it's worth 150 gold, because that's the cost of 2 stealth wards. (WELL, assuming you bought two stealth wards... obviously a sightstone is free)

If it lasts for 6 minutes and helps you get ward kills, it's worth even more. 

You can potentially ward that bush for the entire game while only spending 100 gold. 

Those two small bushes in the river are often fantastic places for pink wards... It's surprising how long they'll last without being killed.

Putting a pink in the bush by blue buff will often last like 20 minutes. 

If people were smarter in league, everyone would be buying at least one pink like 2nd or 3rd time back and putting it in a bush on their side of the map. At the very least, it allows you a 4th ward when your limit is only 3.

When my son, for example, gets extra rowdy while playing pretend battles against pretend zombies (I honestly don't know why this is his favorite imaginary scenario at 3.5 years old; I guess my boyfriend talks about zombies way too much), I have to tell him, ""I love that you have such an imagination, but let's try to be less destructive when we play.""

Shortly after getting married I found out that my husband hates using a dishwasher and would much rather wash dishes by hand.

I also felt completely incompetent within a couple months of living there because I couldn't do anything ""right"" and he had to do it all for me. At work I ran an academic department and writing center. At home I could not hang up my own coat on a hanger properly therefore he had to do it. 

I also had no idea to what extent he and his parents would decide what was in the house and where things would go (he always would say I had some decision in this because I bought one or two things with some birthday money once and he pointed out that I had bought them when he was on a work trip and he didn't make me move them when he got back, as if that was a freaking gift compared to the hundreds of things I had no say in).

ARUKET,martialarts,1391204503.0,"I wasn't trying to be poetic or anything. That's what it looks like. You start the fight by stepping in and punching and dominate the space. By putting the opponent on the defensive you remain in control of the fight. You get in, throw punches and elbows and knees and whatever it takes. The combos in WT are ridiculous.

And the kick defenses are solid. My sifu learned under Leung Ting, who used to train fighters for San Shou. The WT fighters would drill the same three techniques repeatedly: The wedge, chain punching, and the lau gerk kick defense. And it worked. There's this old ass picture of a fight in the 70s or 80s of a WT guy at a competition pulling it off. Admittedly things have changed since then and Leung Ting has a big mouth so it could all be bs. But in my experience the kick defenses are pretty damn solid.

Another kick defense is simply throwing a front thrust kick. Works wonders considering the front leg is almost always unweighted in WT and you can land a kick way before you get kicked.

I understand the negativity towards WT, don't get me wrong. I myself see holes in it which is why I want to supplement my training. But I don't think it's fair to just assume it can't work."

 If there's one thing I've learned about having RA (and goes for those who were diagnosed later in life) - There's a big difference between a disability and a handicap. A disability: *limits* a person's movements, senses, or activities. - A handicap: *restricts* a person's ability to function physically, mentally, or socially.  
  
RA, though potentially debilitating, is a disease that can be lightened by simple changes in the way one thinks. There have been monks controlling the sensation of pain for generations. It does not restrict a person from doing daily tasks like you mentioned, unless in the severe stages (even doctors agree daily tasks are good for RA patients!) so there's no justification for the way she is treating you or the life *you* have primarily built, by the sound of it.  
  
I smoke about a pack a day (which, as we know, is not good for arthritis), and totally agree that if you can walk a flight of stairs ten times a day, at minimum, then you are capable of crawling around on your hands and knees to pick up things off the floor. I've even gone so far as to scoot around on my ass - judge me, but the job was done and effortless.  
  
I don't mean to respond to this and go on a meaningless rant. It is, after all, your omc. So, my apologies. Though, it just crosses my mind that this way you guys are living... these are conditions you would expect from a relationship with a person with severe RA. Money problems, time management, etc... those are personal problems that RA doesn't cause, but it definitely makes them more apparent.

It obviously rhymes enough with ""seek"" to be considered worth  tattoo.

In fact, the answer is clear: seek is the Anglicization of the word, especially British.

&gt; Singh said that the ""seek"" pronunciation in the United States ""comes from the Anglicization of the word.""

&gt;""Unless of course they were brought up in a British English,"" he continued. He said those who grew up speaking Punjabi and British English - who are relatively commonplace, since Indian is a former British colony - will use the ""sick"" pronunciation when speaking Punjab and ""seek"" in English.

SO it's an accent thing - and where I grew up, by Sikhs themselves it was seek.

to an extent i feel that but I generally am only bothered when they're ""Kickstarter exclusive"" I wish KS Exclusives were aesthetic only. Maybe promo style exclusives that would be hard to find but not impossible. 

&gt;The games seem to be missing the whole point of the term ""stretch"" as in ""Wow we wouldn't have even thought about being able to do this before hitting this funding level"" 

a fair complaint but it's not as easy with board games to throw in a component without testing it and the KS timeline doesn't allow the kind of testing. You really have to release the KS with ideas already down the pipeline of what you'd like to extend it to.

shadow1515,bestof,1391204930.0,"Almost a fair point, but good luck getting a job without a steady phone number and Internet access. I work for a large national retail chain that actually cannot (well, will not, but people at a local store have no power to bypass it) hire anyone without them completing an online survey. Also, you need to do a drug test, but it has to be within so many days after they complete your background check, and if you aren't able to receive the call to let you know when to schedule it then you can't, so you don't get hired. So to even apply you need at the very minimum Internet access and a reliable phone number.

And anyway, having a smartphone doesn't necessarily mean you have a data plan. When I was unemployed for a couple of months I cancelled my cell phone plan. I still kept my phone, and I kept my Internet on because of the above reasons. I used my phone just fine with a $4 app and Google Voice.

steve496,49ers,1391205114.0,"Let me address those points in reverse order.

When his current contract runs out, Staley will be 32.  There are some positions (RB) where that would be extremely old, but offensive line isn't one of them.  Its not at all uncommon for lineman to play into their mid-30s; Goodwin, for instance, is 35 and has still been a very solid player.  I'm sure Staley will start to lose a step at some point, but there's no guarantee that it will happen before the end of his contract.  And it almost certainly won't happen in the next 2 years, so at the very least we have a couple of years before it becomes a problem.  I won't say we won't have to worry about the position at some point, but there's about 45 spots on our 53-man roster we'll need to worry about first.

Given which, I suspect the major barrier to the Jonathan Martin is that there's almost certainly some other team out there that needs him more.  Whatever we're willing to offer for him - either in trade to the Dolphins to get him directly, or in terms of a free agent contract if he's released - will almost certainly be bettered by some other team that has a legitimate need at T.

The only way around this is the Stanford connection; if Harbaugh wants him more than the team's needs would indicate, or Martin wants to play for Harbaugh badly enough to take below-market-value, there's some chance we could get him.  The problem is: there's been no evidence that that's the case.  Not all of Harbaugh's ex-players are particularly fond of him, and Harbaugh has shown no particular affinity for picking up his Stanford players; he's signed a few as UDFAs (Owusu, Thomas, Debniak) but to date none of them have made the 53 man roster.  One can debate the reasons for that, but the simple fact is: Harbaugh hasn't show much of a Stanford bias when it comes to drafting or building the roster.

And if we're nitpicking, there's also the fact that Martin hasn't been particularly good.  I mean, he's started, but he was one of the poorer starters in the league, and I'm not particularly convinced that we can't do better by developing the guys we already have on the roster.

So: we don't need him, there's no particular evidence we even want him, its unlikely we'll offer the Dolphins enough to trade for him, and even if he should hit free agency there's no particular reason to believe he'd choose to come.  I won't say it can't (or even won't) happen... but it seems unlikely."

Perhaps find out if there's a place that sells Doctor Who merchandise near the end of your route and approach them about working together - you could come to some sort of agreement where you'll end all your tours at the gift shop, give everyone on the tour a 10% discount voucher for the shop and the shop will give you a commission on the sales received in return.

ARUKET,martialarts,1391205313.0,"Although the basic strategy is to rush the opponent, there's more to it than that. What I like best about WT is that it can adapt to anything instantaneously. If you fight a boxer and he covers up against chain punches, once your hand collides with his arms you can turn it into an elbow or a clinch or something. Someone knocks your hands away, they bend and whip back as a chop or backfist or backwards elbow. It's not like someone who moves his head is instantly safe as the chunner keeps punching the air in front of him. Chunners are also taught it's okay to move your head or body to dodge too, at least at my school. We train specifically against people who would bob and weave and lean and everything in some of our pad training.

I understand all the skepticism and I myself don't think it's a flawless system. We have a BJJ teacher come in on saturdays to teach a variation of bjj that's a bit more in line with the chun way of doing things. There is little to no grappling game and what a chunner takes years to gain in skill, a boxer gains in two months. But I really believe in WT, it all works in theory but the problem is we don't spar enough and too many instructors refuse to adapt their curriculum. This is why I'm trying to sign up to a local MMA gym, to force my WT to work."

Well, just one example is the evidence uncovered in favor of the [multiverse theory](http://phys.org/news/2010-12-scientists-evidence-universes.html). Multiverse theory is referenced repeatedly in Hindu Puranic texts: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse_(religion)#Hinduism. It's not restricted to Hinduism, of course, but I just find it fascinating that the very concept was referenced and discussed in these ancient texts, and centuries later we're uncovering evidence that it actually exists!

TRP to English translation:

Then, my girlfriend and I got married, and even though our incomes combined, it looked even better, because she was in school and working part time.  We only had 31k coming in for 2 people, and I ended up getting about $1300 per semester this past year.

My mom, however, was always freaking out about how people were going to rape or molest me. Never happened. But her constant (and continuing) worry is obnoxious.

This would produce something that expands, much like a rocket might launch from Earth, produce some kinetic energy and then flies off into space - it is not gravitationally bound (or has not reached its gravitational bound yet).

This scenario has been considered. In such cases, the kinetic energy always decreases, and thus the expansion slows down. It may not slow to 0, but it still slows down. The problem is that we have observed an accelerated expansion. This is in conflict with the idea you have presented."

1wiseguy,space,1391205583.0,"Antimatter is producible, if you are looking for a microgram, and you don't mind spending millions of dollars to produce it.

But let's table that for a moment. Suppose you had a magic device that turned energy into antimatter, and you intend to drive a ship up to 50% light speed. Let's say the ship is big enough to hold 100 people for decades. And you have to slow it down eventually.

How much energy would that take? If you had to build some 2,000 MW nuclear plants to generate the power, how many would it take?

If you can figure that out, maybe you can understand my skepticism.

slockley,WritingPrompts,1391205694.0,"People give being a sidekick a pretty bad rap, but he didn't mind that much.  Jake ""Toughboy"" Coleman was one of the few strength-heroes on the sidekick track.  Strength was usually a golden ticket to full superhero status, but Jake's test scores in personality and bench press relegated him to the lower tier.

As such, Jake was a minor celebrity among his sidekick friends.  All sidekicks were self-conscious about their inability to warrant crime-fighting limelight, and most either admired or resented Jake's powers, which were far better than making spooky sounds or reducing the volume of objects by 20%.

One consequence of being a sidekick was clean-up duty, which was commonly referred to as CUD.  After superheroes saved the day, there was typically a great deal of destruction to various structures, especially when villains were defeated in the denser cities.  For the most part, sidekicks resented CUD.

Today, 2 office buildings were missing whole sections, and Jake and the crew were assigned to replace roofing and several walls.  As Jake began clearing away debris with his good friend Stretch McClellan, he noticed that a nearby vacant lot of land seemed out of place.  It, too, had been crushed by the battle between evil Lord Deathray and the quirky  Ostrichman.  Ostrichman defeated Deathray, but was unable to capture him before he disappeared through what appeared to be a cobalt portal to who-knows-where.

But the gound on the lot was somehow off.  There was no building foundation, but the crumbled remains of what appeared to be faux-wood siding seemed to be scattered along the ground.

""Stretch, what's going on at the vacant lot over there?  It looks like there was part of a house or something.""

Stretch easily turned his head 180 degrees to view the lot.  ""Uh, I think they said that was totally empty.  Lot for sale, I think.""

Somehow that didn't look right to Jake.  ""Look at that windowframe, though.  That didn't come from these offices.""

Jake was right.  Stretch couldn't account for the white-painted metal that appeared to have held window glass a day before.  ""Maybe somebody just threw away some scrap metal there.  Huh.""

Jake and Stretch loaded several trucks with drywall and scrap aluminum studs from the offices, and began hauling in new materials from the nearby parking lot for the repair.  Jake saw a little girl in an Ostrichman T-shirt that appeared to have come from a second-hand store watching the action.  ""Hi, little one!  Be sure to stand clear, this is a construction site, and we don't want anyone getting hurt!""

The girl's eyes lit up.  She had never been spoken to by a superhero before.  ""Are you Sargeant Funderfist?""  Jake smiled at how offended Sgt.  Thunderfist would be at his name being mispronounced even by a 6-year old.

""No.  Way better.  I'm Toughboy!  And this is Bendy McRubberpants,"" Jake said, pointing to Stretch, who rolled his eyes before correcting him.

""Just Stretch"" Stretch corrected, looking at the girl.

""What's your name, little miss?""

The little girl's eyes were wide with excitement at the idea of talking to superheroes; she didn't yet know how uncool sidekicks were by comparison.  ""Sarah.  My dad has 2 of you, and 3 of you!""  Toughboy wondered if her father collected action figures or superhero cards, but didn't ask.  As she stepped closer to the heroes and the construction, Jake stepped in to block her path.

""Okay, sweetie.  It's not safe here; maybe you should scamper home.""

The little girl looked at her bare feet, then at the nearby lot.  ""I don't have a home.  My house got smashed.""

Jake looked at the rubble that he had previously thought was discarded scrap.  This girl and whoever her family was must have built a makeshift shelter on a vacant lot, and it got destroyed in yesterday's fight.  Jake's usually perfect stature went slack and his brow furrowed.  Then he turned to Stretch.  ""McRubberpants, we've got a new assignment.""

""Again, it's Stretch,"" Stretch said to the girl, who giggled.

---

""What do you mean, we lost the bid?""  Lord Deathray did not take bad news well.  ""I outbid Cisco by 3%!""

""It wasn't a higher bidder, sir,"" said Deathray's office manager, the DeFiler.  ""The city said it was just a 'better' bid.  They wouldn't comment further.""

""Did they give a name of the fool who somehow got my building rights at least?""

""A mister J. T. Coleman.""

""Who the crap is that?"" Deathray said, not expecting an answer.  DeFiler gave none.

---

""And this is the kitchen,"" Jake said to the Martin family, Kevin, Shandra, and little Sarah, who was busy wiggling a lose front tooth.  ""Check out the countertop, the whole thing is one piece of granite.  I carried it in myself.""

""Thank you, mister Toughboy,"" Kevin said, staring out the window of the newly built home, at the recently repaired office buildings next door.  Kevin and Shandra were not used to, and hardly comfortable with asking anyone for help.  ""Since I lost my job last year, we haven't had any good luck until Sarah met you and Stretch.""

""Sidekicks always help our fellow citizens.""  Jake's cheeks reddened slightly, embarrassed that he had nothing more genuine to say than his sidekick training's motto.  It had been drilled into his brain enough times, that those were the words that fell out of his mouth, despite how corny it was.

Jake took the Martins through the rooms, and then walked them through the paperwork of having the property signed over to them.  He shook hands with Kevin and Shandra, and kissed Sarah on the top of her head, before stepping out to the front yard.

There, Stretch was watering the newly seeded front lawn with a water hose, by extending his arm across the yard, while his feet stayed stationary.  Stretch looked at his watch and jumped a little.  ""Dude, we're late.  We gotta get to 3rd Street!""  He turned off the water spigot with his elongated arm.

Jake wasn't worried.  ""It's cool.  Just turn into a hang glider and we'll be there before anyone notices.""  He turned to the Martins and gave his best superhero salute.  Then he picked up a newly triangular Stretch, and they flew off toward downtown to clean up after the next superhero mess.  ""I love CUD, don't you?""

Stretch agreed."

Serae,raisedbynarcissists,1391205718.0,"My mother did something very similar to me five years ago.  My dog growing up was a gem.  I was exceptionally attached to her as an only child.  I got her when I was 2 years old and she was very old when she was put down (almost 18 years old, but she was in remarkable health).

My mother called my boyfriend (now husband) to have him break the news to me.  My boyfriend told me and I immediately drove back to my home town (I was in college) to get my dog and put her to rest.

My mother told me she died peacefully in the car on the way to the vet.  When I called my mother back as soon as I could collect myself she told me that she arranged to have my dog cremated.  I had told her, many times, that should my dog die while I was at college to wait for me to come get her.  If she needed to be put to sleep I needed to come to her and say goodbye.  I also told my mother that if she arranged cremation for me dog that she'd generally be cremated in a pile along with other dogs and that I may not get her ashes back, or just a mix of other animals.  I would handle it, have her cremated alone and I would keep the ashes.  

My mother lies.  A lot.  She lies badly.  She said it was done and then I the same sentence that she would go get my dog's body herself.  It was not more than two hours after I found out that I was on my way home.

When I got home my mother said she'd already buried her in the yard.  It was February, freezing, the ground was solid and it was actively snowing.  I went outside and fresh snow was on the ground.  The ground was flat and loot unditurbed.  My mother has a bad back and there is no way she could have picked up my dog after hours, driven back home, dug up the frozen ground and buried her in such a short amount of time.  She was hiding something.

I was going to school for archaeology.  I had dug up a few dead people and animals in my time (and many more since then).  I told her that I needed to grieve and that I knew she was hiding something.  I suggested I dig her up.  She FREAKED OUT.  She pretty much kicked me out of the house and told me that if I was disgusting and if she ever caught me trying to dig up anything in her yard she'd call the cops and tell them I was robbing her.

I didn't know what to do.  I still don't years later.  When my mother's personal dog died and was buried my mother let it slip in the usual selfish manner, ""You don't know what I go through.  I had them both put to sleep.  I disposed of them both.  And I did all the grieving all by myself.  You weren't even there for me.""

I asked her to repeat herself, called her out on her lie and told her she needed to tell me what happened to my dog.  Her reply?  ""She peed a few times in the house.  I just don't have time to clean up after the animal you left behind.""  

I don't really know what happened to my sweet dog.  It looks like my mother just put her to sleep because she didn't want to take care of her.  I blamed myself and I still do.  I went to college and I couldn't take her.  I would have if I could have.  I asked myself, ""Why did I have to go?""

Year later I still have nightmares about my dog.  I pang for her and I ache because I don't know what happened.  I don't know. :(  No one told me anything.  I called the vet to ask and apparently my mother requested that those event details never be released to anyone.

I wish I could comfort you over this.  Years later I have only just been able to keep a straight face while talking about my dog and have only just started putting pictures of her into public view again.  My mother did something terrible to my dog and myself.  Your mother also did the same terrible, horrible thing.

I am SO sorry you have to encounter.  Truly, so very, very sorry.  I tried painting a big rock as a memorial to my dog.  Three years of trying and I started crying my eyes out the moment I sat in front of it to work.  Time helped.  It did.  It took a lot of time.  

I have some of her hair in a locket.  Her hair was very unique.  I can look at it now and not cry.  Sometimes I do cry for her but much less.  She lived to be rather old and her life was good with me.  I don't know what to say except that I am sorry. You aren't the only one who has been through this.  I'm glad you family is seeing her for who she is.

ctesibius,TrueAskReddit,1391205741.0,"Mttw 24:15 is using a phrase from II Maccabees (a book which Protestants treat as apocryphal, but included in the Roman Catholic Old Testament). In the original book, it refers to the invading tyrant Antiochus Epiphanes setting up a statue of Zeus in the Temple in about 150 BC - he also sacrified pigs on the altar. In Matthew, it is looking forward to the destruction of the temple in 70AD. Caligula tried to install a statue of Zeus (he died first), and Hadrian tried to install a statue of Jupiter Capitolinus. The ensuing revolt under Simon bar Kokhba eventually led to the banishment of the Jews from Palestine. Anyway, the point is that it refers to an event in our past. The important point here is than apocalypse (an, not the - there are several in the Bible) does not necessarily refer to end times.

II Thessalonians 2:4 does refer to the second coming of Jesus, but not to the role of the Temple in it, which is the subject of discussion.

I'm not sure why you mention Rev 11:1 in particular. If we were discussing exegesis, I'd say that the book as a whole is an apocalyptic work almost certainly referring to the persecution under Nero. The biggest reason for this is the famous 666 - or 616 in some other early manuscripts. These two numbers are both numeric encodings of Nero's name in Latin and Greek respectively (one might have been a coincidence).

However we're not discussing exegesis but what Christians believe as a matter of practice. Most pretty well ignore the book, and if they consider it, don't take it as a literal account. Readings from Revelation rarely occur in the lectionary (the book of set passages for each day). The whole business of the Rapture is almost unknown outside the USA. The supporting passage in Revelation has been interpreted many ways in the past, but usually with the theme that we are living in the thousand years. Most of these interpretations ""timed out"", but I don't think that any of them were part of official church teaching.

You asked about interpretation in different geographical regions. Other than for the USA, it's not really a geographical thing. The Roman Catholics are by far the largest denomination. They do believe in the physical return of Christ, and the physical resurrection of the dead (which is why they are not supposed to scatter cremated ashes, for instance - not because it would make resurrection impossible, but because it tends to deny a physical resurrection). To the best of my knowledge, they place no great importance in the Temple in these events.

I have no direct knowledge of Orthodox beliefs, but I assume that they are similar to the Roman ones.

Protestants vary, but other than in the USA, most will apply a symbolic interpretation to Revelation, comparing it to other apocalyptic literature. Again, no role for the temple. Also no literal battle at Megiddo, no literal thousand year reign, and so on.

I thought he was intelligent and pretty decent looking, but that was basically a fleeting thought. I have to admit I basically forgot about him once the class was over; we were nothing more than passing acquaintances. 

Then, a solid three months after the class ended he friended me on FB, sent me a message, and asked me out. I figured I had nothing to lose - I knew more or less nothing about him other than that he was generally pleasant from the class - so I said yes. Within two minutes of sitting down to dinner together we were best friends, by the end of the night we both knew we had found something special. I can honestly say I've never had a relationship this wonderful, and I've never been so sure about anyone in my life. We still joke about that semester we spent basically ignoring each other, never knowing what the future would hold. "

Noumenology,occult,1391205796.0,"&gt; Your point about zombies/vampires is rather profound, as there is something being communicated. Shouted, actually. What I hear is that (some, but not all) humans are losing our ability (either intentionally or not) to generate their own energy. Both the tropes represent those who have died, yet are still operating as if they are human. They are not truly alive, so they must feed off of others.
&gt; I might suggest that, although this is not a new situation, the reason these images are being spewed forth with such energy is due to scale: humanity is in danger from those who are feeding off of it.

Love this post. absolutely agree. My personal belief has been (though I'm not sure I still feel this way) that online media and the proliferation of ""public"" dreams and stories through readily available creative work has stifled the private dreams and imaginings of communities and individuals - our collective unconscious has ""woken up"" and we are bloodshot, weary and overtired. In a sense, we need to go back to sleep, to recharge, to dream and imagine our own better worlds and to process the experience we are living - but we know this world is always on and always awake in some fashion.

Rose_Stone,Psychonaut,1391205851.0,"I was a philosophy major, lifelong stoner, and didn't get serious about my psychedelics until my mid-20s. I became a Seeker and a Journeywoman, and worked with shamans along the way. I was Austin's Princess of Goliath Trips for some time.

Now, I'm 29 and sober - no drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. I am also a vegan, a trained yogi, and pursue meditation in a serious way. I've renounced materialism and practice equanimity in everything I do. And I still consider myself a psychonaut.

Since I've become sober, several yogic, kriya, shakti, and kundalini experiences have functioned as/resulted in a consciousness or awareness shift. Reading ancient and Eastern philosophy, the Tao, existentialist philosophy, and even some poststructuralism can create this as well. Math theory and, obviously, quantum and astrophysics do this, too.

Long meditations and breathing exercises. Fasting. Being physcially exhausted. Many things can foster these feelings in a natural way. 

It's funny, after becoming sober, I thought I would lose it all. But, on the contrary, reality is typically hyperreal or hyper surreal for me. My awareness guides me, and allows me to practice this rather tender insanity that I can still shield from the square world. If I wasn't able to remember tripping, what it did for me, how it connected me and helped me grow as a woman, a human being, and a collection of atoms/energies, I think I would miss doing drugs.

Instead, it's like it's with me all the time. I don't know how to explain, but I am ever so grateful to be able to scrape the rust off my DNA and transcend ego still."

azuretek,news,1391205915.0,"&gt; When you list all-encompassing stats you also have to include home birth into the equation.

I'm merely addressing your assertion that thousands of years of evolution are better than modern medicine.

Either way based on these studies we see that home births aren't very common (0.72% of births). However it is the highest percentage of home births since 1989. Only 25% of those were actually attended by a medical professional who could provide emergency care if needed. (Physician/certified nurse midwife vs certified professional midwife/other)

http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db84.htm

On the bright side
&gt; Home births have a lower risk profile than hospital births.

which is good news.
&gt; The lower risk profile of home births suggests that home birth attendants are selecting low-risk women as candidates for home birth.

The problem is, even though most home births are selected for low risk candidates the death rates are still higher than hospital births.

http://10centimeters.com/no-matter-how-you-run-the-numbers-the-result-remains-the-same/

All the numbers in that blog post are directly from the CDC. Recently Oregon released their official homebirth stats and it showed 6-8 times higher mortality rates than hospital births.

Chances are really good that - if the ultrasound finds anything at all - the cause will be a cyst down deep in the tissue.  The worst that'll happen there is that it will need to be drained.  That process is not exactly a day at Disneyland on the fun scale, but I'd probably choose it over dental surgery.  But you might just get antibiotics and anti-inflammatories and have to go back in a month, maybe several months in a row to monitor.  I've had one of each, neither of them left lasting effects as far as I can tell/feel/see.

You don't say how old you are, but if you're 23-24ish this might actually be a final gasp of puberty.

Russian_Surrender,changemyview,1391206043.0,"&gt; A child should not grow up only hearing the one side from their parents.

Just curious whether you then believe that an atheist family should make sure to spend the same amount of time talking about Christian, Hindu, Buddhist and Islamic beliefs as they do talking about their own beliefs?  And, if so, how can *any* of those discussions be effective with a 0-8 year old when one day they here that Jesus is the one true God, the next day they hear that Allah is the one true God, and then next day they hear that there is no God whatsoever?

&gt; Child indoctrination is not just telling a story, and hoping the child believes it. It's actually changing the way a child things and it can mess with the person for the rest of their lives in both directions.

The problem here is that I just flat-out disagree with your premise because I can't relate to it with my own experience.  I was raised in a reasonably religious home (church at least once or twice each week, praying before every meal, praying before bed time, etc.).  When I was growing up, I didn't really **think** about it at all.  I just did it.  And realistically, I wasn't much more than ""present"".  I didn't actually pay attention to what was being said; much less analyze it.

I now have my own beliefs - which could or could not be interpreted as ""religious"" beliefs - based upon all of my own observations of the world around me.  I think it was good to be exposed to religion so I at least had some rough idea of what I was accepting or rejecting; but I don't think that exposure did much to get me to the point where I'm at today.

portugalthephilosoph,politics,1391206115.0,"""Mr. Obama"" is considered an adequate way to refer to the President.

&gt;The 1787 Constitution of the United States did not specify the manner of address for the chief executive. When George Washington was sworn in as the first President of the United States in 1789, he initially used the style, ""His High Mightiness, the President of the United States and Protector of their Liberties,"" a title elaborated by the Joint Congressional Committee on titles over the course of a month. Critics charged that it smacked of monarchy. Washington consented to the demands of James Madison and the United States House of Representatives that the title be altered to ""Mr. President."" The first Vice President of the United States and the second President, John Adams, felt the title showed too little deference and lacked prestige, but he was unsuccessful in replacing it 

Also, ""Chief of State"" is not a title held by the President. The President of the United States has 7 official titles (referred to as the ""hats he wears""):

* Chief Executive

* Head of State

* Commander in Chief

* Director of Foreign Policy

* Party Chief

* Economic Guardian

* Legislative Leader

None of these is Chief of State.

TL;DR: You're right. Titles matter. So get them straight and stop ostracizing people that do."

&gt;Not that what you're saying is even true

You may have wanted to do some research on this before trying to come out all high and mighty by telling me what my own country is like. Police officers do not carry firearms except for in special circumstances. Most are not even trained to use them. We have armed response forces for when we need them (note the recent murder of Lee Rigby, in which the nearby officers had to call in armed response because they weren't equipped to deal with the situation). Northern Ireland is an exception and does arm regular police officers. England, Wales and Scotland do not.

And why do I think this is an example of my country being less authoritative? Because policemen with guns are pretty fucking authoritative!

Anyway, I'm starting to wonder why it's me who is being held with all the burden of proof. How about you try to explain to me what makes my country such a ""police state"". And maybe while you're at it you can explain what exactly I'm supposed to be jealous of. "

I get along really well with my crush and for a short bit, we had a FWB situation until I came clean that I liked him as more and he (respectfully) let me down that we wouldn't evolve into an actual relationship. We're back to just friends now, but having experienced him find me sexually attractive AND we get along great as friends, I was just left wondering WHY we couldn't actually date. I never asked as I didn't think I'd benefit from any of his reasons (likely age difference, and the different stages of life we're in).

In general, sleeping with a guy you like when he might not like you back in the same way is kind of damaging to one's self-esteem. When he'll have you one way, but not another?

The Walking Dead is now a household name, 28 Days Later isn't.  That's my point.  The past 4 years has seen an explosion of *new* zombie fans, *because* of this TV show.  The video game industry is well aware of this."

This is not new. This has been happening forever.

&gt; People understand the derivative markets and debt are unstable, they will need something else they can trust to transfer wealth and it will be crypto.

Or gold or whatever other investment vehicle they want to use. And also you are under the assumption that everyone hates debt and derivatives which is not true. Though there are a lot of shady things done with them I wouldn't be able to own my house if it wasn't for debt instruments.

&gt; People do not like to pay fees JUST to transfer THEIR own money.

I truly think if they had said, ""Alright, we don't want our work out there for free, but we understand some people just want digital versions after they already own the cassettes or CDs, so were going to work with some other artists to set up a digital distribution network.  We also understand that some people just want free music, and we'll never stop them, whether it be CD burners, cassette copies, or digital downloads - and ultimately, we'll never stop them, so be it, but we're here to make sure our fans have the easiest access to our music.""

And why/how would an Argonian who can't step foot into Windhelm's walls want to join the Stormcloaks? Why would the Stormcloaks recruit an Altmer, the very race that is behind the Stormcloak rebellion? And why would any other race want to join the Stormcloaks when they display such a strong Nord pride (does ""Skyrim for the Nords!"" ring a bell)? Unless an individual shows hatred against the Dominion and/or the Empire through actions then I don't really see the Stormcloaks recruiting outside races. 

&gt; I think that there would be plenty of humans who feel that the best way they can survive is to help the elves and get on their good side. That being said, I agree that it will be based on numbers. If there is 50% faction appropriate races, to 50% faction inappropriate races, then it would be a shitty looking Alliance.

I could see the Aldmeri Dominion in TESO recruiting outside races. It's unclear how radical the Dominion in TESO is, but from what I've read it doesn't appear that they exactly look down upon he man races, they just don't see them as experienced enough to hold such a high order of power since men races live such short lives compared to mer.

Your logic is to join the enemy (Aldmeri Dominion) to avoid the enemy? If the Dominion was to say turn on the men races then I doubt the Dominion will stop an think ""Mmm..this man here fought for the Dominion, we'll spare him.""

It would be a huge pain, for example, for a Dunmer to join the Daggerfall alliance. It would require that said Dunmer to travel across Tamriel (during a war too) to join an alliance for whatever reason. It's possible, but this will be an issue with some character stories and the idea of having a large portion of outside races in an alliance.

&gt; I don't think anybody picks their Alliance and then picks their race. I think people choose their races and then go with the Alliance that has their race. The exception being if one guy picks a race that belongs to an alliance that none of his friends play. Which again creates a minority of players. One guy choosing to switch because a majority is in one faction already.

I'm not sure how creating a character will go but if I was a person playing TESO that is totally new to TES I would likely go with playing as an Argonain and then join the Aldmeri Dominion because the alliance has pretty, light colors unlike the other two alliances. Someone else might like the looks of Khajiit and then might join the Daggerfall Covenant just because they like the name. I can't say how many people will be like this though when picking a race and alliance though.

&gt;I lean geolibertarian

Me gusta.

&gt;

&gt;I have a mostly utilitarian rather than deontological outlook. I try to start from the intended outcome and work my way back to make rules and guidelines that will lead there, and be sustainable afterwards.

Lots of ancaps are pure utilitarians. 

&gt;I believe that the same rules should apply to everyone, and that the basic structure of society should be arranged such that no social group advances at the cost of another.

Unfortunately, the structure of the modern state makes this impossible.


&gt;I believe government shouldn't protect informed citizens from themselves, nor should it imprison (or spy on!) citizens without due process. Because of this, I don't like the War on Drugs and the War on Terror. At all.

Smart.

&gt;I don't accept the homesteading principle as valid justification for eternal property claims.

I can sympathize with you. There has to be a line drawn for abandonment.

&gt;I think property is an arbitrary concept, and that chasing someone off your lawn with a gun could be considered infringement on their liberty and initiation of force if they have a different understanding of property.

You might have a point.

&gt;This is even more wrong if there is nowhere else for someone to survive within reasonable distance.

I'd agree. Property exists to serve human needs, not as a dick to wave in people's faces.

&gt;I don't see much difference between rent and a land tax.

I'm a Georgist.

&gt;Even after reading through the Machinery of Freedom, I still believe there are many ways in which anarchy (including DROs and PDAs) could devolve into more oppressive forms of government than what we have now. Keep in mind that a free market would still be populated by power-hungry warmongers, crony capitalists, corrupt demagogues, and the ill-informed statists who vote for them.

I'm skeptical of ancap theory because I don't believe in trying to plot out society. Just end the state and let freedom rebuild society.

&gt;Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.

So they all suck?

&gt;I don't mind current levels of government spending, but I don't always like how it's spent.

Are you on crack?

&gt;I don't like income tax for many reasons. It's hard to enforce (since wealthy corporations can hide their incomes easily), requires government to poke its nose in everybody's business, and putting people in prison for failure to pay seems rather unfair. Also expatriation taxes, ugh. I would prefer a land value tax, with loss of title to the relevant properties being the only penalty for failure to pay.

Read ""The Income Tax: Root of all Evil"" by Frank Chodorov. He was a Georgist too.

&gt;I don't care much about marxist class distinctions like ""worker class"" and ""manager class"" and so on. In my mind everyone is an entrepreneur, doing the best they can to improve their well-being given the options and information available to them.

Eh, maybe.

&gt;I believe a market economy (free-er would be better) and either limitations on property or social programs (basic income, health/education vouchers) are necessary to protect individual freedom. I don't want either landlords or worker's councils having unlimited control over me. I want capitalism, communes, and homesteading to all be viable options for those who want them.

I think we can get along.

&gt;I don't believe government needs to have a monopoly on anything, but it can be useful for them to provide a baseline of essential services to protect citizens from market anomalies. So for example I believe there should be both public and private courts, security, education, health care, currency, mass transportation, energy, etc. As much as possible, funding should be through vouchers so that private entities don't have to compete against ""free services"".

If you mean what you say by you don't think the government needs a monopoly on anything, then that might be alright.

DrewCali,nfl,1391206613.0,"Cincy is not that good with Andy Dalton as quarterback. He turned to ball over four times. Chargers were suppose to be beaten by the cheifs and have their playoff hopes dashed, but squeaked in do to the missed field goal by the cheifs and went into overtime. 

Yea you did do a good job against New England and shut down SD for 3 quarters. But football is not 3 quarters, its 4. Conditioning and cardio comes into play.

When Aquib was in he did a good job on demarius. When he was out, Peyton Torched NE because their DB's were mediocre at best, they couldnt cover or transition their hips. 

My only concern is Peyton has a stellar offense, but hasn't faced a Defense like Seattle's in 2 years. So this matchup is a toss up. On the otherhand Denver has a below average secondary. Champ Bailey will do his part, he'll probably cover Percy Harvin (this wil be an interesting matchup), But whos gonna cover Doug Baldwin? Rogers-Cramartie? How about Golden Tate? Can Denvers Free-Safety Mike Adams cover Seattles tight-end Zack Miller as well as Seattles All Pro Free Safety Earl Thomas can cover tight ends such as Jimmy Graham and Vernon Davis? 

People keep talking about Peyton Manning all day, people who don't know football, but I think Denver's Secondary is the key to who wins or loose this game. And Denver is horrible against the pass. Their ranked 27th.

Only WRs Brady had was elderman and almendola and a third string thompkins. Not the most physical dudes out there or experienced.

Peyton will play well, but i think most importantly, Denver's secondary which is its biggest weakness can be what makes Denver looses. With WRs Percy Harvin, Tate and Baldwin, and Jermaine Kearse lining up for Seattle."

I think the ability to choose is what is important. I am definitely presenting this as only an alternative option to the current custom. The reason why the current custom is deeply ingrained within most, or all, societies is because it is the structure we are most used to. It is why many people today face so much (negative) social pressure when choosing to go a different route.


I offer it as an alternative, and one that could possibly be easier to sell to friends and relatives. Specifically on the kids, I don't have any strong positive benefits to articulate - it can assuredly be left up to choice. I think if the mainstream culture were swayed to this structure, people would face less societal pressure when naming their kid what they want. As opposed to the pressures under the patriarchal structure. On the side, it would allow for the development of matriarchal lineage. As powerful as patriarchal lineage is for men, it could be the same as for women.


I think last names and lineage are important personally; I admit, which is why I structured it as I did...but I also think it is important to most cultures as a whole. Why else would we have the current custom we do today? It's easier to change customs via offering an alternative, rather than waiting for it to die out through non-conformance. "

A soldier is responsible for his/her actions according to military ethics because every soldier represents the interests of the nation that deploys him/her (which is why the standards are so high).

So, needless to say, it took a bit of adjustment to get used to driving and mapping out the location of houses in a much larger city.

I got a call to delivery to a small condo area right near the beginning of my shift. No big deal. When I get close to the door I hear the intimate sounds of love making going on. Not one to be deterred easily I ring the door bell and knock loudly a few times. I hear the sounds stop and a fully nude, hairy, sweaty man answers the door with a raging hard on. In the background is a woman on the couch who is spread eagle and staring at me. It shocked me so much that I *dropped* the pizza bag. So I kept trying to keep eye contact with the guy at the door, while feeling on the ground for the pizza bag, while trying not to have his dick hit me in the face.

The best part was that after I handed the guy his pizza and had his change he didn't even close the door, he just locked the screen. I saw him set down the pizza and go right back over to the woman. That's some dedication.

In two years time I had been attacked by a goose, stiffed on a $800 order, held at knife-point, gun-point, car robbed, physically attacked, bitten by a dog and have seen every size/sex/race nude.

You're fucking kidding right? Get off this thread, because you obviously know nothing about farming, the farm bill, or farm subsidies.

Farmers are entitled to a handout because our entire nation's food supply depends on them. Farmers grow the plants you eat, they raise the  cows that provide your milk and cheese, they raise the livestock that you eat, and they provide it all at significant risk. 

In most normal businesses, your profit margins and overhead are both controllable factors. If something goes wrong, it is usually because someone made a mistake--human error.

With farming, you are at the mercy of the elements. One bad storm, an inch less precipitation than you expected, an invasion of bugs or disease... you're done. You're fucked for an entire year. You put *everything* into your crop and livestock, and it is your only commodity. 
Livestock and crop insurance help to mitigate these natural conditions that result in losses. They allow the farmers to keep up with their yearly projections despite bad weather, drought, or disease. The farmer is reimbursed for the losses sustained due to uncontrollable conditions.

And the farmers aren't the only ones that are helped: by stabilizing prices in the corn, dairy, beef, pork, or whatever markets, we keep food costs down and quality high. This means that ""poor children"" are getting better food at lower cost. 

SO: go learn some about farming. Learn about the farm bill. And learn about how THE 3RD LARGEST SECTOR OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, and ANYONE WHO EATS benefits from this."

There is no 'recent desire' unless you mean the start of the 20th century when tanning for white people meant leisure time and wealth. It meant they could travel to somewhere warm and sunny and didn't have to spend their time indoors working.  This is in contrast to victorian times and before when tanned skin meant you worked outside in fields so at that time the mark of wealth for white people was a sallow, pale look.   

Now fast forward to recent times and the 'tanning' thing hit it's peak in the 80's and then again in the 90's with tanning beds but that was 20yrs ago and today anyone tanning on a regular basis looks more than silly, to the point of vain and stupid in disregarding their health and actively attempting to cultivate skin cancer.

2 weeks into deadlifting and you're already doing above bodyweight for multiples?

Even if you've been lifting for years, there's no way your form is good.  You're also lifting too many reps for a beginner, especially if you are in season.  

It takes a few weeks to get used to the lift.  Hockey skating requires you to bend over, so you aren't resting your back enough.  

Drop the weight.  Do your progressive stuff in the offseason.

Post a form check.  
 
Most important: How much you lift is secondary to how it benefits your hockey game.  

 Google hockey in season weightlifting programs.  

Power cleans are good, too.

Okay, go to law school then tell me that.

You misunderstood what I've said, so let me clarify. There are four levels of *mens rea* in criminal law: intent, knowledge, recklessness, and negligence.

Intent is basically when you do it on purpose, and try specifically to do everything that is against the law. It's pretty obvious. This is like black-van-ski-mask rape, or roofie rape, or she's-constantly-saying-no-and-I-hear-her-and-am-consciously-ignoring-her rape.

Knowledge, in this case, is pretty similar, because if you know you're doing something, and you're doing it, and you know it's rape, and you don't stop, you kind of just did it intentionally.

Recklessness is a little more subtle: it's when you don't really know whether what you're doing is the crime or not, and you don't really care. Say, for example, a guy fucks a girl, and she doesn't really say much, and she might be drunk or high and completely not have any idea what's going on, but he doesn't care to find out, and he just keeps doing it, whether or not she actually thinks anything like yes. He's aware that he might be raping her, but he ignores that possibility and does it anyway.

Finally, negligence can happen even if the criminal doesn't actually realize that what he's doing might be the thing that is a crime, but he should have realized it, and then he goes ahead and does it. For rape, this would be something like... an idiot has sex with a woman, the woman said no, clearly, and a reasonable human being would have recognized it as a real no-means-no-type-no, and that there was no consent... but, unfortunately, the poor idiot didn't realize what she was saying. 

But if you didn't realize she did not consent, and it wasn't through negligence on your part, but you were perfectly reasonable and she just didn't make it clear, you can't be convicted -- of rape, or of any other crime (for the most part)."

You plod up and up, ever watching your step; over rough rocks, rolling and sliding; over loose steep shale and sand.  You are out of breathe; you are weary; the blazing sun beats down upon you; you may say 'What's the use?'- when all at once you reach the top and get that grand expansive view and look over into a promised land, on to weird snow fields, to silvery, flashing streams, down into azure lakes, up to ragged peaks, into the purest air and the bluest of blue skies.  It is the call of the high country; the call of the Main Crest; the call toward heaven!""

soandsoandsoandso,Sacramento,1391207596.0,"SAFE was the most disappointing experience I've ever had. I opened an account with them when I was still in HS, and had them for almost 10 years when I got this notification in the mail that I was at risk for ""identity theft"" because SAFE ""potentially lost"" my (and thousands of other customers') account information. Per the notification, I went into SAFE to ask them what I could do to protect my account. The woman told me (quite literally): ""There's nothing we can do to help you. ID theft happens *all the time* to SAFE customers and it's not a big deal."" I was offered no help, no advice, nothing. I even asked for a manager and she told me the same thing. The only ""advice"" they gave was for me to close my account, so I did just that.
  
I ended up filing a complaint with the NCUA and I was told the woman at the branch, and the manager were ""disciplined"" for the interaction. By that time I had already closed my account, opened one with Schools, and was given help by Schools to keep an eye on my credit (since they provided me with the 800 numbers and stuff to do that).  
  
Maybe my experience is odd, but I will never recommend SAFE after that experience. Not only were they completely indifferent to my plight (which *they* caused!), but refused to even give me the advice I needed to make sure I wasn't a victim of ID theft. Never, ever again."

Think about that for a second. You think that smoking pot has held you back, but maybe it didn't. That experience has *shaped* you in some way and you've identified it as one of the reasons you are not where you want to be. So you know the problem. You know how to fix it. That's a helluva lot more than I think most people know about their problems.

So use that. Use it to help people not make the same mistakes. I know it sounds weird but I'd tell every single person every single f'd up thing I did in my life if it meant I could persuade someone from doing the same thing. 

By the way, I am by no means perfect. I'm 38. It took me a long time to get a job I'm satisfied with. I made lots of mistakes. I'm overweight (but dieting and exercising again).

ctesibius,TrueAskReddit,1391207666.0,"&gt; 2 Thessalonians 2:4

Oops, sorry, missed that. Ok, bear in mind that the text does not refer to this as ""the"" antichrist. Personally I'd interpret this as for the Little Apocalyse - that it's referring back to Antiochus, and hence forward to the (now historical) desecration of the temple. However I wouldn't be sure of this interpretation as Paul is not usually described as a prophet. The main point is not to assume that it refers to something still in our future.

&gt; Revelations 11:1 asks that the ""temple of God and the altar"" be measured, which - in a literal sense - would mean it would need to physically exist. Of course, depending on interpretation, this could also refer to the whole of Christianity and not a physical place.

Exactly - also bear in mind that in the vision, the instruction is given to the writer (who is obviously dead now). Measurements and the use of a plumb-bob in visions usually have a symbolic meaning in the Bible, e.g. Amos 7:8.

Yes, I fully understand what you mean by the distinction between belief and knowledge - but (leaving aside  II Thess 2 which I'd have to look up), these are the normal beliefs for most of the world. The Roman and Orthodox groups set their beliefs by Holy Tradition (simplifying, this means that the priests tell you how to interpret a passage according to traditions developed over 2000 years), which doesn't involve a reconstruction of the Temple. And most Protestants will read carefully and look for context (e.g. the Antiochus stuff) and have never been exposed to the USAian interpretations such as the Rapture."

For my diet, as I stated in the original post, I have 2 meals a day and just try to cram in as much as possible in the moment, I don't have an effective way of counting those calories. I drink a 50g protein weight gainer after my workout that's roughly 600 calories.

As for people's attitudes... I am not a fighter, nor do I ever pick fights but when I was 125lbs I noticed that every now and again when I was out at a party or bar it was more likely that some drunk a-hole would try and start something. Now that I have a decent physique and fill out my clothes better, it doesn't really ever happen. Causal conversation with people is easier as well, but I think it is mainly the confidence that came with the muscles if that makes any sense. And because I have more confidence, people can subconsciously pick up on it, it seems, thus helping to draw more people into my presence.

With women, it has been a huge difference. Because of my confidence I am more likely to take risks and talk to women whether it be in class, a bar or where ever. Girls also seem more likely to go out of their way to talk to me as well. Back at 125lbs, I would concentrate on one girl at a time and usually fail, but now I'm usually in communication with 2-3 girls at any given time.

Even if the internal benefits didn't occur, it would still be worth it just from the way people treat you. It's not rocket science, the more attractive you make yourself, the better people treat you. "

Bambikins,elderscrollsonline,1391208010.0,"&gt; With the exception of Altmer, I think the stormcloaks will take any arm they can get.

Skyrim has no short supply of Nords and there is already a large sum of Nords that believe in the Stormcloak cause. The number of non-Nords that would want to join would be incredibly small anyways (due to the reasons I gave in my previous reply). 

&gt; You really don't think that people might do this? That people might be so terrified of an enemy that they join them to be spared?

Like I said, the first Aldmeri Dominion doesn't come across as extreme at all. The Altmer along with the Khajiit and Bosmer stay secluded and to themselves in their home provinces (also note that Altmer live on an secluded island away from the base land), I doubt anyone in Tamriel other than high political figures would even know of the Aldmeri Dominion's plan of putting a mer in the place of power over a man.

&gt; I really don't think people who buy the Pre-Order, or upgrade to the CE later on, ACTUALLY think like this. You aren't taking into consideration the fact that this isn't something that everyone can do. As far as we know for sure only pre-orders get this, and then the rumored upgrade from SE to CE.

I'm a bit confused here. I thought that you don't need to preorder the game to play in any alliance that you so choose with any race, minus as an  Imperial unless you buy the special edition?

sharshenka,changemyview,1391208078.0,"Not the person you are replying to, but let me give it a shot.

First ""black"" means African American.

A person who is racist might hate rap because it is ""black music"" and say it is not legitimate music, but not spread the same vitriol on all black musicians because general musicians (Hendrix, Michael Jackson, Bruno Mars) are making music for the general audience, which in America means white people. If you knew nothing about the artist and had only heard the music, I doubt you could tell if that person was black. Rap music, on the other hand, is culturally black, as is pointed out above. So a racist will hate it even if the performer is white because "" it must be awful, it's for **them**"".  It's like being mildly racist enough to not even try soul food (assuming you arent the type of person that never trys any new foods), but not so racist that you would send back a meal if you learned the chef is black.  

Also, the artists I mention above might be seen as imitating white culture, thereby recognizing its superiority, where a rapper is trying to create a separate culture, which can be seen as threatening.

Again, there's nothing wrong with saying ""rap is not for me"", it just gets questionable when someone acts like it shouldn't exist or have value for anyone.

There are laws concerning disposition that need to be followed, a lot of paperwork that many families probably don't know about that needs to be filed, and most of all, preparing bodies for viewings/funerals is therapeutic to families and helps start or move the grieving process to a place that is healthy and real. There have been numerous times when loved ones disappear and are never found, but are considered to be dead. Families go into denial because they never saw the body of the loved one. An example of this is 9/11. Some family members or spouses of those who died but were never found still claim that their loved one is alive because if they were dead they would have been found. Funeral Directors play a part in helping families in their time of need, it isn't just playing dress up with dead people."

MechMeister,AskHistorians,1391208124.0,"A quick google of The Jewish Diaspora returns a [fantastic Wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora).

&gt; A 2013 study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by Costa et al, reached the conclusion that the four major female founders and most of the minor female founders had ancestry in prehistoric Europe, rather than the Near East or Caucasus. According to the study these findings 'point to a significant role for the conversion of women in the formation of Ashkenazi communities.

Remember that for centuries, Jewish history is a series of expulsion, trade, and migration. While that pattern spread across the globe for 3,000 years, the majority of that migration happened in Europe. So over time those people lived and reproduced with other Europeans and various groups travelling/conquering thereabout. 

Nevertheless, [Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews have roughly 30 percent European ancestry, with most of the rest from the Middle East.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_studies_on_Jews)

So, to go any further I think this question is better suited to /r/askscience or /r/biology because it is beyond the scope of historians to answer why skin appears ""White"" despite most genetic markers hailing from the Middle East."

lana-del-boy,relationships,1391208174.0,"Before I write this comment, I should clarify that I was in your exact situation. When I was 18, my mum started dating a 22-year-old. My brother was 21 at the time. Yes, it was fucking weird. They're still together, three years later.

Having said that, you kind of sound like an entitled brat in this post. Sorry, but having been the entitled brat myself I feel like I can offer some empathy.

You say that you respect for your mum is disappearing. Why, just cause she's dating a younger man? She raised you (and seemingly did a very good job) and your sister, while holding down a job. That's respect-worthy. So what if she has a younger boyfriend? Does that immediately make her unworthy of your respect?

Second, it's not your living-room. It's hers. Tough shit, but mom's house, mom's rules. If she wants to chill in the living-room with her boyfriend, she has every right to do that without you hanging around like a bad smell. Doesn't make her a bitch.

You say that you're not judgmental about age in relationships, but would you feel the same if your mum was dating a 40-yr-old guy? Probably not.

Lastly, as to the whole ""making my mum admit this affair"" stuff - maybe she doesn't want to define the relationship cause you're so obviously against it. It's hard enough during the early stages of a relationship, when you're still deciding on what the relationship is/ how it's going to progress, without dealing with kids.

Basically cut your mum some slack. She's enjoying herself and it's not really impacting you at all - I don't think that clearing out of the living-room and having your mum's boyfriend strike up a conversation with you is really ""affecting [your] life"" significantly."

Some professionals say humans are causing global warming, and others say we are not.

The professionals at Mars One say we're going to have people living permanently on Mars within a few years, and some say that's ridiculous.

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1391208429.0,"&gt; Assuming standard-issue M-F couplings, each time people have sex, exactly one woman and one man are involved and one tick goes in each column. I fail to see how it could be otherwise.

He's not assuming ""standard-issue"" monogamous M-F couplings. 

He's assuming polygamous relationships.

There are 3 types of averages: mean, mode, and median. 

Alan, Bob, and Olly are stuck with Alice, Betty, and Olivia on an island.

Alan is the ""alpha"" and gets all the sex from Alice, Betty, and Candy. About 27 times, maybe 10, 9, 8 ""ticks"", as you call them, from each of them respectively.

Bob is a beta. He gets maybe 1 tick from each of the girls for 3 total.

Olly gets nothing. 

Total amount of sex for all the men is 30. Total amount for all the women is 30. Each man has sex a *mean* of 10 times. Each woman's count is a mean of 10.

The ""mean"" is the same.

However, autoNFA is referring to a different ""average"". He explicitly mentioned the ""median"", not the mean.

The median is 1, for the guys, with Bob having the median score. For the girls in this case, the median is 10, with Betty having a 10 count, Alice having 11, and Olivia having 9.

This is more likely when there is a higher variation in reproductive success in men than women:

"
Greggor88,WinMyArgument,1391208580.0,"For a philosophy student, you sure have a poor understanding of the terms ""atheist"" and ""agnostic"". The terms are not mutually exclusive.

&gt;The problem is this: a lack of evidence of a theistic entity poses no more evidence for atheism than it does for Christianity

Atheism is a negative argument. It is the rejection of the premise, ""There is a God."" You do not need evidence to reject a premise. If you did, then what would stop you from unconditionally accepting outlandish, unsupported hypotheses (e.g. an undetectable orange dragon farts in your face while you sleep)?

You seem to be conflating the exceedingly rare viewpoint of ""gnostic atheism"" with the vastly more common ""agnostic atheism"". Agnostic atheism does not require belief; it is merely the rejection of belief given the absence of evidence. It is the default skeptical point of view. 

You, yourself, are an agnostic atheist with respect to almost every deity in history. This means that you do not believe in the existence of, for example, Hathor, the ancient Egyptian goddess of the sky, because you have not been presented evidence to the contrary. This not to say that you firmly believe in the impossibility of Hathor's existence — that would be gnostic atheism — you merely reject the premise of her definitive being.

I'm sure you see my point by now. The relevance to the conversation at hand is this: it is a straw man that you are attacking. Agnostic atheists make up the majority of atheists around the world, and they have the same opinion of *gnostic* atheists as they do of gnostic Christians.

&gt;Take for example Aquinas's ""Argument from movement""

Thomas Aquinas's infantile ""first mover"" argument was overthrown centuries ago, and today could be unraveled by a child's curiosity. Here are some common objections in descending order of complexity.

* There is no reason to believe that infinite causal chains are impossible. Why can you state by fiat that there *must* be a ""beginning of movement"", but I can't state by fiat that there *need not* be a beginning? An infinite causal regression can be possible, even if each link within the chain relies on a cause, if the chain itself is not contingent on a cause.

* The ""big bang"" is postulated as the point of existence of all dimensions of space-time. Therefore, it doesn't make sense to ask ""what came before?"", as there is no concept of ""before"" without *time* which was created in the big bang.

* Time could be cyclical.

* An eight year-old could always ask the dreaded question, ""Who created (or 'moved') God?"". And you would have no response, other than to say ""God has always been"" or ""God created himself"". That's special pleading. If God ""has always been"", why couldn't the universe have always been? If God ""created himself"", then why couldn't the universe have created itself?

&gt;Maybe our sensory perception does not allow for us to perceive God, or our rational faculties are not evolved enough for us to understand such a conception.

Then what is the purpose of talking about it? You understand what you just did? You threw out the rules of logic with regards to God, and then you asked the listener to prove the non-existence of God using those rules you just threw out. That's a non-argument. If you're going to have a rational discussion about a subject, you need to choose a framework and stick with it. If you throw out your own framework in the first sentence, you're no longer playing by the rules, and this isn't a discussion anymore.

&gt;[Philosophical God] can aid us in solving logical puzzles.

Thought experiments are fine and dandy, but they lose their value when you insist that they have any bearing on reality. For example, scientists use thought experiments such as Maxwell's Demon to aid in the formulation of theories. But to suggest that such a demon actually exists, and that it is worthy of devoting one's life to it... that is a ludicrous proposition.

I'm no philosophy student, but I am interested (in a totally non-combative way) to learn what sorts of logical puzzles the idea of a Philosophical God can help solve.

&gt;Who is to say that putting efforts into prayer, believing in an afterlife, helping out at church events and making contacts is not vital to us?

For one thing, I think the great number of people who have lived their entire lives prayerless and godless would beg to differ with your assessment of these activities' necessity in human life. Why do you assume that they are vital? They are very clearly not.

&gt;Surely these activities exist for a reason

Of course they do. The reason, however, may not be to your liking — and because it is not, you reject it. Dependence on faith is as much a part of evolutionary psychology as dependence on love or the desire for security. Some people feel a need to fill their yearning with a comforting belief. It's not wrong to do that. But that does not support the existence of the idea that those people use to satisfy their desires. Read *[The Biology of Religious Behavior: The Evolutionary Origins of Faith and Religion](http://www.amazon.com/The-Biology-Religious-Behavior-Evolutionary/dp/0313364303)*. It covers this subject in great detail while remaining respectful to all faiths.

&gt;I have a hard time believing that they would commit to a faith out of ""stupidity"".

That's where you and I agree. I certainly do not think people commit to religious beliefs out of stupidity. I do, however, postulate that they commit to these beliefs out of ignorance. Ignorance is not a bad thing. Ignorance is the first step of the learning process. Some people begin their learning process with a de facto disbelief of religion, i.e. atheism. These people are ignorant too. The key is to think rationally about the subject and to arrive at your own conclusions. It is only those who refuse to think critically, who glorify their ignorance and shut out all dissent — those are the only ones whose beliefs I simply cannot abide."

Kate2point718,SubredditDrama,1391208719.0,"Yeah, I don't think it's sexist at all to prefer your doctor to be one gender, especially for a gynecologist. Similarly, when finding therapists you're usually asked if you prefer a man or a woman. Some people just do better with a certain gender and that's usually not because of sexism. I'm female and I thought that I'd do better with female doctors/therapists/whatever, but it turns out that I just happen to be more comfortable with men (still think I'd prefer a female gyn, though).

I can't agree with her reasoning, though. You can't see a male gynecologist because he doesn't have a vagina or experience periods? In any other field of medicine you wouldn't expect your doctor to have had the same experience you have, so why would not having the same parts as you make a doctor less competent at gynecology? He still knows a whole lot more about medicine than you."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1391208786.0,"&gt;What higher living standard is there than ""spending time with your loved ones""?

Higher monetary standards. I meant.

&gt;And who would provide you the goods and services? Anyone making anywhere near this guaranteed income now quits, because why work a crappy job when you get almost the same amount for nothing.

Because you don't lose your benefits by working. This isn't welfare in the sense that it does away with that problem. EVERYONE gets basic income. It doesn't matter if you're a millionaire or a minimum wage fast food worker. It's just that the millionaire will pay more in taxes than they'll recieve from UBI, while someone on minimum wage would see whatever taxes they pay in largely offset.

Say you make $15,000 a year on UBI. Say there's a flat tax of 40% on earned income.

You get a minimum wage job at $7.25, and you end up making $15,000 a year with that. You pay in $6,000 in taxes on that. 

So, with UBI, you actually make $24,000 a year on a minimum wage job. This is $9,000 more than you'd make just sitting on your butt collecting UBI. Working will ALWAYS guarantee a higher standard of living than simply being on UBI. Because you'll earn wages on top of UBI. As you can tell, taxes will be higher to fund the UBI, but this is basically meant as a way to claw back the benefits fairly without saying ""oh, you're working, we're gonna drop your benefits."" Quite frankly, you'll need to make $37,500 just to reach the break even point where you begin paying more tax into the system than you earn. And you could probably pay a lower tax rate in general up until you make around, say, $80,000. And that's on a single earner. Married couples, being made up of two people, receive TWO UBI checks. So they'd make $30k without working, but say they both work jobs at $20k each. They each pay in $8k, and ultimately go home with $54,000 a year.

This dramatically raises the living standards of the poor and middle class. Yes, some can choose not to work, but they'll be basically the bottom feeders, just having enoufgh to make ends meet. To truly have what is considered a ""living wage"", you'd need to work.

&gt;So what happens? The cost of basic goods and services go up. Now, the guaranteed income no longer covers food and rent.

Do they go up now? No. And yet our markets are distorted by welfare. Replace UBI with welfare, and I doubt you'll see many changes among necessities. You will, however, see changes among luxuries perhaps, since demand may increase for them. But as long as demand for products remains constant, then it's unlikely that prices will change all that much."

Even if they are not always active, if they will help grind during the clan wars is what matters.  In every division besides diamond, it is about grinding out the wins and taking a strong lead in the very beginning will help reduce the amount of grinding you will have to do. If you have people who are not active and that you do not play with often, I would remove them.  I had to remove someone after the last clan war because he had not been on for the one before and he promised that he would be on for that one, but did not show.    

Best way to get CP for wins is to take as many nodes at the start that you can, then when they get you down to 0 wins on a node, Hit that game mode hard and take it right back.

Only 25% of home births are attended by medical professionals who can perform life saving procedures. 43% are only certified for minor medical procedures/complications. The rest are completely unqualified to do anything if complications arise.

&gt; The statistics and blogs are skewed towards one way or another depending on what the bias is.

I'm not sure how there could be a bias in reported numbers. This isn't an opinion, the information is available freely to you and me. I merely linked to those blogs because they put together the relevant data in easy to browse screen shots directly from the source.

&gt; But ultimately the human body has a high success rate to do what it was designed to do.

I'm not arguing this point, I'm just telling you based on the data available that empirically hospital births are safer and result in less deaths and complications. Natural births are more dangerous, medical science has made a huge impact, you can't argue that fact."

We were defensive this season, for two reasons I think. Firstly we need to be more organised defensively, we've thrown so many games away because we were not defensively well organised. I love attacking football as much as anyone but you need to be solid at the back.

Secondly, we had 7 new players to integrate. I think that was a mistake in hindsight but I expected some of them to hit the ground running a bit faster. With that in mind the smart thing to do is to keep everyone organised and getting the basics right while the players adjusted. Essentially we were buying ourselves time.

Chadli was amazing in the first two games, willing to take players on and could actually get a ball into the box, unlike the media's golden boy, Townsend, who for all the pace and desire was seemingly incapable of a final product."

What's more, if he was doubting, he had to be thinking. He then realized that only something that exists can think. How can something be thought without someone to do the thinking? Descartes was inching toward a discover. Putting two and two together, he concluded that if you can think, you must exist. For even if you think you're dead, the fact that you *think* you're dead means you're alive, because thinking implies existing. Descartes had found proof of existence. Hence his legendary epigram ""I think, therefore I am"". It was a giant leap forward not just for philosophy but for science in general, because it seemed to establish something irrefutable, and thereby provided solid ground for all further investigation""

Sanctorious,LeagueofLegendsMeta,1391209448.0,"I don't think he compares to a number of other popular top lane champions out there atm, but as long as you can work around his mana deficiencies (tear can work well at resolving these issues) then he does become incredibly strong. I've played him a few times in top lane and enjoyed a fair amount of success. This does not mean that he is actually good in top lane.

Because his main form of a trade is aoe damage he will shove and push the wave under the opposing turret. If you get an advantage on the enemy top laner, however slight and they start backing away to avoid trades, should your jungler come and you lack flash to instantly ulti them and drag them back, you should prime your q on minions to gain the slow and optimal damage, which therefore forewarns them of your intentions and gives them more reason to play with caution.

The sustain from his e is rather negligible imo for the mana cost, so a number of Skarner players don't even bother getting points in it until level 8, since you can benefit more from the increased shield health to keep the move speed attack speed buff, or from the damage and slow on your q. This reduces mana dependancy a little as its less to drain your mana pool, so you can go a little lighter on mana items, and invest in a few more health pots, which when combined with the current defense masteries, do more than enough to help with sustain, especially when you are trading with a shield up.

He is really strong late game, he allows great ganks onto his lane due to his ultimate, but the mana costs early remove a large part of his strength, and a lot of other top laners can punish you for that. There will be some picks that will destroy him, others which he effectively shuts down, but he isn't a great pick in and of himself. I would say that it would be best to pick him into a strong lane for yourself, or when a team comp can revolve around him, or he can synergise perfectly within the team that has already been picked."

.2: Changed kPinLeds[numLEDs] = {blah} to kPinLeds[] = {blah}
As far as I know you don't really need the number in the array since you're immediately assigning the eight values anyways. In addition, I'm pretty sure that [numLEDs] is actually going to assign *nine* variables to the array, one of which will just go unused for the remainder of the sketch.

There may be practical reasons to have the variable in there, but I've never done it.

.14. Removed single quotes from '1'.


.20. Removed single quotes from '2'.


.25. Removed extra closing bracket before 'Else if(command = 3)'. The Serial.available check was closing out before it even got to this part, so if any code were actually put in command 3 it would have ran regardless of whether there was any serial information.


.26. Removed single quotes from '3' and added a placeholder {return;} to be filled in with later code.


.27. Added closing bracket after command 3.

However, you will probably see many people around this subreddit talking about LORAC pro as well, which is another excellent neutral palette.

Sometimes it's easy, but sometimes it's not - if this is one of those cases where it's not, it's possible to try and turn that around before giving up on the relationship. 

So - why is sex just okay for you? If you can't articulate why, that's your first step. If you can, the next step is to ask if these are fixable things. Is everything he's doing technically correct but there is some kind of essential ""spark"" or chemistry between you two that is missing? Or is there something technical that you can fix - improve his technique in some way? You say you usually sleep with older guys; it's possible that their experience and confidence was what made sex with them better, in which case your SO should be able to work on both of those things.

OctavianRex,nba,1391209867.0,"Ok here's the situation. Everybody and their mother knows the Bulls are going to look real hard at Carmelo this upcoming off-season. There is reported interest from both sides, and Carmelo would add the go to scorer the Bulls have needed beside Rose. Problem is the cap situation. Even with Boozer being amnestied the Bulls are going to sit at around 10 to 12 mil in cap space, which is not nearly enough to sign a max player even at a discount. So they would need to trade someone just to make room, only people who fit this criteria would be Rose (not happening), Noah (Could happen for a great offer), and Taj (our most likely candidate). Everyone pretty much knows Taj is who the Bulls would look to move, so offers are starting to appear.

Now for the facts of the matter. 

1.  Taj will not be traded this season. It just doesn't make sense for the Bulls to do it. The Bulls are currently below the luxury level and will not go over that for anything but a sure thing. They no longer need the big expirings, and are content to just play out the year. The only way the Bulls would trade Taj is for a major improvement player or a number 1-3 pick in the draft. The only players that really fit that bill and might be on the block are KLove (Don't worry wolves fans, that isn't happening) and Melo(Why would they do that?). Since no one seems to be giving up first round picks, I don't see a trade happening.

2. Taj will have to be traded for no incoming salary. The whole reason to trade Taj is to clear space, so the Bulls cannot accept any player with guaranteed money coming into the season. This severely limits the Bulls options.

2. Taj would not be traded until Melo has pretty much guaranteed that he would sign with the Bulls. The Bulls have traded players to make space before namely Hinrich, but Taj still has a very nice contract while Hinrich was wildly overpaid. Since the Bulls want to compete next year and this trade can't be for a player, the Bulls are going to hold onto Taj until the last second.

So based on this, any trade for Taj will happen in the offseason for picks/team option players. It's possible the Bulls could attempt to sign and trade for Melo using Taj as leverage to the Knicks or a third team, but I think the Bulls think they can get some value back from Taj from somebody in the league.

If I were the Bobcats I would consider offering an unprotected pick in 2015 for Taj and the Bobcats 2016 pick. I don't know if the Bulls would take it, but it would be an interesting low value offer."

As for your approach, asking to do an activity can be a good way to get to know each other in a lower pressure situation. That being said, the activities you've listed seem to all require a certain amount of skill. I personally wouldn't want to do any of those, especially not on a first date, because I don't have any prior experience with those activities. I'm a bigger fan of drinks/coffee/mini-golfing as a first date. 

Keep trying. You'll find women that will not only accept you, but be excited to get to know you. 

After getting a woman's number, maybe try to text her conversationally for a while to build interest and get to know each other (but not for too long!) before asking her for a date. Most of the time I like to do most of my talking/flirting/getting to know someone on a date as compared to text. This approach won't work as well for you, so try to do a fair amount beforehand to increase their comfort level, and maximize your time together.

Google already punishes companies for paying for SEO, wherein another site has a bunch of pages generated just for search engines that contain links to other pages in that ""network"" which also link back to the main site.  If that's complex, it's pretty simple.

For pages A, B, C, and Buyer, have A link to Buyer, B, and C. Have B link to Buyer, A, and C. Have C link to Buyer, A, and B. They all link to each other but they also link to Buyer, which must be pretty important because it's got so many links. It doesn't work, but some people think it does.

If that's the case why look at any information available? Why shouldn't we just make up our choice based on gut feelings?

alkaline810,thatHappened,1391210034.0,"There's that saying ""Those who can, do; those who can't, teach.""

This is especially true in the tech field.  I've been through public schools, trade school, and university.  The teachers are just plain bad.  In my example below which was downvoted to hell, the teacher who worked at IBM extolled the idea of always carrying around a 1.44MB disk for personal use; something she'd always done at IBM.  Nevermind that 1.44MB was a virtually useless amount of data at the time when CD-Rs were all the rage.

That's the problem with teaching about technology, it's hard to stay up to date.  They have their curriculum which I'm sure was solid the first year of teaching, but with technology advancing as quickly as it does these days, even after a few years that information is useless.  It's basically like learning about Discmans when the 5th generation iPod touch has been out for years.

In my e-commerce class we had an entire section on learning HTML for website building.  For my final project I just whipped out a modern CMS (drupal, if you care) and wowed my professor that I was able to set up a decent site in about 15 minutes.

AgentDL,AskMen,1391210238.0,"I can tell you from personal experience on both sides that *""rebound"" relationships often don't happen on purpose.* People have this idea that a person will consciously think, ""I need to get over my ex so I'm gonna get into another relationship so I can get over him/her."" I'm sure that happens sometimes, but usually it's unintentional. 

When I got divorced, I immediately ended up in another relationship with someone who was the polar opposite of my ex-wife. At the time, it was very refreshing, but after a number of months I realized that I wasn't happy with her either because I had gone completely from one end of the spectrum to the other. Extremes in either direction aren't good. I broke up with her, and in retrospect I realize it was a ""rebound relationship."" 

As far as rebounds go, there are no rules. In my experience (again, my own, and that of a couple friends), the ""rebound realization"" sets in around 4-5 months in. 

My advice would be to just enjoy yourself, don't worry about the rebound concept, and handle it like you would any other relationship with maybe a little bit more attention to whether your man seems like he's really ready for what you're bringing to the table. "

And, quite frankly, although there are some pieces I very much like, your art teacher seems to be jizzing on his trash and giving it high concept names.

Modern and/or contemporary art is going to vary in its purpose. Some has none at all, some has a philosophical purpose, some is meant as cultural commentary. Sometimes it's meant to shock you. Sometimes it's simply an exercise in the vanity of the artist. Modern/contemporary artists such as Mark Rothko, Keith Haring, Jenny Holzer, and John Cage (my favorites) are oftentimes expressing an abstract thought, meditation, or interpretation of theirs (Rothko) in their particular artistic style. There are other interpretations as well. 

[Here's a link for a short guide on how to look at contemporary art.](http://www.howtolookatcontemporaryart.com/the-4-step-process.html)

[Even the review of this book might be somewhat helpful.](http://coloradoreview.colostate.edu/reviews/innocent-eye-a-passionate-look-at-contemporary-art/)

Look at a piece of art for a good 90 seconds. See what visceral, emotive, or communicate response is coming up for you.

Nausved,FeMRADebates,1391210660.0,"A person who suspects that others might find them intimidating, and therefore goes out of their way to avoid scaring others, is a good person. Their heart is in the right place. My boyfriend is very tall, and he tries to be careful about inadvertently startling people, etc., and I love him for it.

But ultimately, I don't think this is the right thing to do, at least not on a large scale. People with irrational phobias don't get better by living in a bubble. If 75% of tall black men like yourself took care to avoid mild encounters with strangers on the street, it would make the remaining 25% of tall black men who just walk down the street like normal appear *extra* scary—not simply because they are tall black men, but because they are exhibiting somewhat odd behavior compared to other tall black men. Also, the less exposure people have to tall black men, the more fearful they are when they meet one.

For this reason, I think it is actually better for people who seem intimidating for whatever random reason (sex, height, tattoos, hairstyle, accent, clothing, etc.) to *seek out* friendly interactions with strangers, not avoid them.

I am a short white girl, and I can't think of any time in my life where a tall black man has made me nervous. I grew up in a poor-ish neighborhood and I've been subjected to some pretty fucking scary behavior on the streets*. But I also grew up in Atlanta, where I've encountered thousands and thousands of tall black men without incident—enough that I don't instinctively categorize them as distinct from any other demographic I've commonly encountered.

I mean, I'm sure I'd be nervous if I encountered a green man with antennae, but after having had a couple dozen close encounters without anything happening, I'd probably get the fuck over it. But if every green man I saw scurried away when he saw me to avoid causing me undue worry, that wouldn't make me feel any safer when meeting a green man face to face.

-----

\*It is worth noting that my experiences on the street actually make me *more* scared of someone who is obviously trying not to scare me. It doesn't occur to most people that others might find them intimidating, so they don't do anything special to reduce any appearance of threat. In my experience, it's people who *do* mean ill who go out of their way to try to disarm or surprise you."

They were going on about his career and bravery. All the while myself and a hundred or so other U.S. Marines were standing at the position of attention. We had been in this position for 45 minutes before this even started. We were wobbly. As this was happening about a million crows descended upon the site. They were fucking everywhere, but did not make a sound when they landed. I thought it was a good idea to mumble ""Nevermore"" after each sentence of the speaker for the fireman. This started a chain reaction of that scraping laugh with your mouth closed, down the ranks. After a minute or so there was audible belly laughter. Our 1st Sgt snapped his head around with a look of ""I'm gonna kill all ya'll.""

First, when we say ""men typically have shorter hair than women"" we need to remember that this is an observation mostly from the context of our modern, western outlook. It's a social norm within our culture that men have shorter hair, but it wasn't always that way. [Pink used to be considered a masculine color](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/When-Did-Girls-Start-Wearing-Pink.html) and [men used to wear high heels](http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/02/05/from-manly-to-sexy-the-history-of-the-high-heel/). These things are no longer *in vouge*, so to speak. Also it's really contextual on the *here* (developed, western world) and *now* (today) to have this view. Long hair is a sign of religious devotion among Sikhs, it was common for Native American men to wear their hair long, and during the 16th &amp; 17th centuries wigs were very long and wavy. There's a really interesting article on the significance of the ""Queue"" hairstyle in China's history [here](http://www.eastasianhistory.org/sites/default/files/article-content/08/EAH08_03.pdf). But coming back to the question, the average Reddit user now probably sees long hair on men as effeminate. 

Before we get to the ""why"" we need to recognize [the cultural weight and significance of a man (or even a kid) having longer hair](http://www.bilerico.com/2010/01/hair_gender_and_power.php). Hair length is a kind of [gender performance, ala Judith Butler](http://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/genderandsex/modules/butlergendersex.html), that communicates our identity in society, and symbolizes values that are not immediately apparent. Obesity was/is [a sign of wealth and good health](http://dianabuja.wordpress.com/2010/10/16/obesity-a-sign-of-wealth-in-19th-century-africa-now/) in some some cultures. Here (particularly on Reddit) it's a sign that people are physically unwell, or even lazy. The symbolism of what one values through their hairstyle can be polemic - in the English Civil War, Cromwell's puritans wore short hair as a sign of their religious convictions for modesty, while the royalists Cavaliers had longer hair and were considered more worldly. So there are strong politics to how people perceive other's appearances (think ""ghetto booty"" ""gym rat"" ""waifish""). African American hair is probably one of [the most politicized features](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/fashion/27SKIN.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) in US society.

Onto the why - there are several possible historical reasons for the origin of this norm. One is the military and how basically a generation of men served in WWI and WWII, where long hair was not accepted (or appropriate) for fighting. Another is the Judeo-Christian values around the appearance of men vs women and how men should cut their hair or else [they are dirty awful sinners](http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1-Corinthians-11-14/) (conversely, some Christians believe that [women must NEVER cut their hair](http://wisdom4today.org/wisdom/why-do-some-christian-women-wear-dresses-or-skirts-and-long-hair/) because [it gives them magical powers](http://hypokriticism.blogspot.com/2012/11/holy-magic-hair-upci-stamp-of-approval.html)). Another reason is that long hair is still associated with the sixties and the anti-establishment attitudes of men then, and so long hair is associated with a sort of *passe* cliche of non-conformity. 

But the real why is WHY are those attitudes so prevalent? The reason for this is because the image of a shaved man with shorter hair is synonymous as a symbol in our culture for success and stability. The same has been true for [facial hair](http://hypokriticism.blogspot.com/2012/11/holy-magic-hair-upci-stamp-of-approval.html) for a long time. Men with long hair are [unemployed](http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/19/christian-bale-explains-long-hair-im-unemployed/), [messy](http://www.ronalfy.com/men-with-long-hair/), [dangerous](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9890931/Rebels-with-a-cause-Bikers-upset-at-scruffy-description.html), [crazy](http://heymedia.wordpress.com/2008/09/23/is-alan-moore-batshit-crazy/), [weirdos](http://www.yanni.com/), and so on. Meanwhile we value men who are [neat](http://imgur.com/I36WhXy), [groomed](http://imgur.com/9dQ3uBQ) if their hair is not very short, [stylish](http://imgur.com/Vmkbm1j). And anything else is just [an anomaly](http://imgur.com/XXjPhim), not the norm.

i_lick_telephones,sociology,1391211025.0,"I study Sociology and I generally study facets of social inequality, so maybe I can shed some light based on asking my professors this same question and some texts I've read. I've wondered the same thing myself, and there's really not a simple answer like ""you're wife is right about what racism entails"" or ""your wife is wrong"". She's kind of both. Yes, racism has a very literal definition. However, we see overwhelming racism towards certain minority groups (when I say minority/majority groups, I've referring to it in relation to their power, not their numbers). And yes...whites are the least oppressed population (we could get into intersectionality, but I'll spare you). It's hard to put into words what I'm trying to say (I'm a social scientist; not a linguist!)...but essentially, yes...in a very literal sense, blacks can be racist towards whites. However, using Sociological imagination and that framework, we generally use the term ""racist"" to refer to the discrimination and the resulting oppression to blacks (and other minority groups that are marginalized based on their race) that is present in both a macro and micro level. White people are a majority group, not a minority...they have more power in a political, economic, and militaristic sense (see C. Wright Mills). 

So, it's really yes and no with no concise answer. It depends on the context. My gut instinct after everything considered from what I've learned is that racism from blacks onto whites for instance, is merely a result of racism brought unto them. I'm not saying black people are incapable of doing wrong or discriminating, but I am inclined to suggest that their oppression is so eternal and normative within the structure that any racism from them onto a majority group is barely a plight as it is in comparison to a majority group exerting dominance and practicing racism on a minority group."

I agree with this, but the thing is, I think we should choose policies that don't explicitly favor certain people over other people. Our policies should be color blind.

&gt;Smoking is definitely a expense that most people could go without, but smoking isn't easy to stop doing, especially if you're constantly stressed about money.
Some people don't have the choice to have kids, or they have kids and are then fired, or their spouse bails on them; don't presume that they made the choice to have children when they couldn't afford it.

There are some things here that are obviously valid, so I won't say anything about that. However, I don't think taxpayers should pay for other's mistakes. Barring rape (which is obviously horrible and an exception to everything I'm saying), everyone chooses to have sex. This is the 21st century, birth control is always available if you need it. If you can't afford birth control, don't have sex. It's really that simple.


&gt;I don't know who you are, or what you've experienced, but you can't just say ""Well, if you're poor, spend less.""

Why not? If you're just squeezing by, hobbies and destructive habits aren't something you have the means for. Time spent sitting around playing video-games is time that you (a lot of the time) could be spending on improving your skills, so you can make more money.

&gt;how much money do you spend on eating out, drinking, hobbies and work expenses

More, obviously. But I also make more. If I didn't have the money, I wouldn't do that. The $20 per week he spends on smokes is almost half of what he spends on food. Also, the first guy is spending $800/month on rent and utilities. That's about 300$ more than I spend.

As for ollies up curbs, I highly recommend you try and ollie over something that can move (like a skateboard deck), since you can hang your trucks up on the curb and fly forward (happened to me when I ollied way too late).

sockalicious,personalfinance,1391211234.0,"Why are you are paying $2600 in rent and saving up for a 20% home downpayment when you are eligible for a VA loan with no down payment and no private mortgage insurance?  Even if your loan limit is less than the ideal home that you want - [find out here](http://benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/documents/docs/2014_county_loan_limits.pdf) - you'll never get a better interest rate on a home loan than you could right now.  The loan limit is $692K for DC, by the way; it varies a lot in different parts of So. Cal, but you could drop your taxable Vanguard money and a few more months of all the money you could squeeze together into a down payment and get into your 800K range if you really felt it was necessary to do that - you could probably do it tomorrow if you really needed to and wanted to bargain hard with a seller who was well aware he was outside the subsidized-loan limits and who would be happy for what he could get.

Separately, I don't love your plan of ""storing"" money in taxable index funds for a home you're planning to buy in less than five years - that money should be in something capital-protected.  Index funds can go down, even if the last 5 years doesn't prove it.  And if your plan is to wait more than 5 years to buy a home, well, I don't like that plan either, renting for all that time is wasteful when you could be building equity.

Your question about a Roth is too hard to answer, it requires a knowledge of the US tax code after your retirement, as well as the tax code of the state you will be living in at that time.  All else being equal, though, you get more bang with your buck with the Roth because you are effectively allowed to contribute more of your pretax income to the Roth than you are to the Traditional IRA.  So I would be using the Roth if I were you.

I don't necessarily agree with DarkMatterEater.  The location of your California rental property really, really matters when it comes to evaluating whether or not what you're doing with it makes sense.  His calculations appear to assume that you will never raise rent during the term of the mortgage (above and beyond inflation) and that the property will never appreciate (above and beyond inflation).  In the parts of California where people actually live, these assumptions have not been valid for any 30-year period in the past 100 years - they've been spectacularly invalid."

For example, you can move from I to I6 by using a V 6/4 as a passing chord in between - in C major, the bass would move stepwise C-D-E, which is less jarring and more interesting than skipping straight from C to E. Other tones also help move that stepwise motion - you may have a soprano voice doing C-B-C in that progression, which is more interesting than staying on the C the whole time. Passing chords can work in a lot of different contexts though - they are basically harmonically inconsequential (in the sense that they rarely have much of a harmonic function) but work for voice leading and extending a progression."

Skyler827,Bitcoin,1391211373.0,"I disagree.  Bitcoin is indeed unavoidably coupled with issues, especially the two big ones, one of which is material and the other of which is institutional.

The primary issue with bitcoin is that its value is too unpredictable to be used as common money.  For bitcoin, this issue is a material issue: money is coming in and out of the economy as confidence in bitcoin waxes and wanes.  Furthermore, another issue with bitcoin is security.  Because most people aren't good with computer security and/or can't read source code, they need to trust bitcoin hardware wallet manufacturers, web service providers or at the very least, client application developers.  For bitcoin, this is an institutional issue.

Clearly something changed between the two. I don't believe in such works being made by only one person. It's always a group.

AngelOfDoom,cosplay,1391211548.0,"While not cosplay, I and my friends used to ""boffer"" a LOT. We made our armor from foam so as not to hurt anybody when the inevitable collisions occurred.

To keep our breastplates on, we used a belt at the belt line that we passed through loops in the back side of the breastplate. This kept the bottom from swinging around. We used elastic cloth bands (see http://www.joann.com/braided-elastic-1-2in-wide-144-yards-white/1070440.html#start=1 for an example) to make an elastic loop to go under our armpits to keep the top of the breastplate from falling off. To keep the whole thing from sliding down mid-battle, we stitched a pair of elastic bands to go over our shoulders and connect to the band that went around our upper backs. (Yes, it looked a bit like a bra... -_- We used camouflage cloth in a somewhat cape-like fashion to hide that.)

For bracers and greaves, we simply made two (or, for some people, three) loops of elastic under the foam armor and slid our arms and legs into them. The elastic is generally good enough to keep armor from sliding in the heat of combat if it is kept reasonably tight.

Oh, and one quick tip: Put your bracers and greaves on BEFORE any shoes or gloves. It's annoying having to take stuff back off.

Unfortunately, I don't know how to make them look good. Since our armor stayed in place when boffering, I'll guess it will stay put on you when you cosplay."

Haiavaha,changemyview,1391211562.0,"Okay, we've got a problem developing here. We're starting to equate a lack of an education with not having a college education, and that's not what we're talking about. Calculus and physics and geology and a whole bunch of other that college covers just aren't germane to this discussion.

So I think that we need to be more careful about what we consider an ""education"" and what we consider ""ignorance"". We started this debate with people's views of social issues, so I propose that for our purposes an educated person is someone who can interact and exchange ideas productively with others from diverse backgrounds in a civil, respectful, understanding manner. Ignorance, for our purposes, is the state of being unable to place oneself in other's shoes, and of being trapped in a doctrine which says that some people are worth more than others, and have more rights or are due more respect and consideration than others.

With these definitions, we can find a vast group of people who never set foot inside a university, but who are still wise and who can connect with people. And we can find a vast group of people who come from very well respected institutions, but whose views and opinions are generally thought of as narrow and bigoted. I'm happy to supply examples from both groups if anyone wants them.

To address your comment, Cooper, I submit that one does not necessarily have to write dozens of exams and pinch pennies in order become educated. There are many paths to an open mind, a thing for which no government or institution may claim a monopoly.

You also ask for a hypothetical situation where changing your view on that would mean throwing away everything you learned growing up. I agree that ppmd's word choice was poor, but I also agree with the spirit of his argument. It is *scary* to discover that much of what your parents and elders taught you might be wrong. It is scary that these people, in which you placed your trust, might in fact have been completely out of tune with the rest of the world. You are forced to question everything they gave you. Your morals, your opinions, your attitudes, your personality, maybe even your own self. That's a tall order. Lots of people become alcoholics or addicts trying to avoid smaller problems."

I fucking hated this album when it came out.
  
Now, I give them respect for making the whole pop-punk thing mainstream, and paving the way for Blink-182 and such, but I was 14 when Dookie came out and I thought it was shit. His vocals were annoying, their style was stupid, and they looked like they tried too hard, which meant that their fans REALLY tried too hard. I was really into Nirvana at the time, and in my mind, the whole grunge ""don't give a fuck"" attitude got changed to a ""look! I'm not giving a fuck! Look at me not giving a fuck"" because of Green Day. This is around the time that Hot Topic came around, (and it was even uncool back then), and those kids would come to school with green manic panic hair and piercings and wearing really wacky shit, and would talk about how Green Day was the greatest band ever because they talk about masturbation and he sings in a British accent instead of the other way around.
  
I know this sounds sophomoric... well, because it was. But when I listen to Dookie now, I still hate it. It still sounds like three class clowns trying too hard to get attention with stupid lyrics and dumb music. And to me, they're still that band.

TheCryptic,electronic_cigarette,1391211713.0,"&gt;What makes them better then something like a MVP v2 and what is involving in getting them to work?

Nothing makes them inherently better, as better is just an opinion.  I do prefer mechs because they are durable, easy to understand, simple in construction, and easy to troubleshoot and maintain.  They are basically just a battery tube with a button.  When you press the button it makes contact and completes the circuit, thereby firing the coil.

&gt;Can you adjust the voltage/wattage?

Not from the mod itself, it supplies the voltage of the battery to the coil.  The voltage cannot be adjusted, but most mech owners make their own coils.  By building different coils you can vary the resistance, which in turn changes the wattage (power).

&gt;Are they dangerous?

They can be.  Generally they have three safety features...  A locking mechanism of some sort so you don't accidentally fire it when you don't want to, vent holes to release pressure and gasses in case the battery vents, and the educated user that understands and applies ohm's law and battery safety knowledge to prevent the vent holes from being used.  With the proper knowledge and equipment it can easily outperform any common VV/VW mod.  With poor understanding and improper use a mech can certainly hurt you.

That's practically another half a unit of Doom Reavers or IFP there to benefit from the fact that you knocked part of your opponent's screen into the now-vulnerable caster. The Decimator can significantly delay the arrival of an enemy heavy from a nice safe distance and is a perfectly respectable melee threat as well.

The Berserker punishes a new player for allocating focus to it. It's a specialized, tricky jack and a terrible way to introduce new players to resource allocation.

I would recommend either a mechanical mod or an advanced mod that can push at least 30 watts.  With that a decent dripper (RDA) performs quite well.  For a little less effort, a Kayfun or Kayfun clone does provide wonderful dense flavor but smaller clouds.  A dripper or Kayfun both require that you build your own coils, but I have yet to try a prebuilt clearomizer that performs as well.  Rumor has it that the Aspire Nautilus is pretty close in flavor, but I personally find it ugly and not worth the price.

Having said all of that, I doubt anything out there truly competes with a good cigar for flavor.  But it's a close second."

Kaisharga,asexuality,1391212345.0,"When you consider homosexuals as capable of having sex despite PiV missing one or the other capital letter, everything has to be reframed. So, that's what I've done. 

Sex is an act involving any number of people, a bodily experience through proximity to another. You'll notice I use the word ""proximity"" and not ""touch"" or ""contact""--voyeurism can be sex, even if the person or people being watched isn't/aren't aware--and in fact this understanding can be used to contextualize the ""violated"" feeling an unwilling viewee may come away with. On the flip side of this principle, phone sex can very much be exactly that.

Sex very often occurs with intercourse, and obviously that's the common understanding of what sex is, but a closer look shows that ""common understanding"" has some holes in it. Consider, for instance, the millions of women who do not reach sexual climax through intercourse--and yet, they consider intercourse to be sex. This tells us that orgasm is not necessary for an experience to still be sex. Intuition confirms this in that a husband would be very unlikely to avoid accusations of cheating by adopting the argument that ""it wasn't sex because I didn't come."" Consider also that this indicates that foreplay is a type of sex, and not necessarily a pre-sex activity.

Masturbation can also be sex, but isn't always. Sometimes a person will masturbate in the same way one would scratch an itch--it's an annoying feeling that must be dealt with before getting on with one's day--and sometimes one will rather do so at length, taking time to more thoroughly enjoy the sensations the activity provokes. These feelings can be very similar to the distinct closeness of sexual activity with a partner, and as such I think it would be remiss to consider masturbation ""not really sex"" categorically. (Ironically, you'll note in the tone of this post that sometimes, intercourse is ""not really sex!"")

It's an unfortunate thing to turn to, but the saying ""you know it when you have experienced it"" applies for sex as well as orgasm. It's a feeling with distinctive intensity and a sense of wholeness or togetherness, most often brought about through bodily contact but may be also elicited by social contact or even thought exercises. Its occurrence can only be indicated during or after such time as it has occurred, and due to its subjective nature the answer to ""was that sex?"" may be different for each person involved.

So BDSM can be sex.

Having a steamy phone conversation can be sex. 

Laying together with your spouse, holding them to you as you fall asleep can be sex.

And between the right partners, having a tuna sandwich with pickles over a discussion of the merits and failings of solipsism can be sex. (As can be any inclination or fetish.)

Genitals are not necessary for sex.

Rape is categorically not sex (though, crucially, it is sexual, inasmuch as it is sexual assault). 

I think this is the most complete picture of what is and isn't sex that I've been able to put together. "

I do have obsessions, but my compulsions aren't really related and are just about reducing anxiety in general (I count all the time and when I'm anxious counting to a certain number over and over and over again helps me stay composed). If I'm awake I'm doing them. I don't think that something horrible will happen if I take 78 steps instead of 79, but I've tried not doing them and I just can't handle not doing it (even writing that made me uncomfortable and I'm now counting to 19 over and over to feel better).

So I can relate because I do think I'm much more compulsive than obsessive. I don't think they have to be related, but I don't know how common it is."

ElderKingpin,LifeProTips,1391212518.0,"LPT: Whenever you leave anything, work, high school, college, or anything. Write a thank you note to everyone who had positive impact on your life. And even if no one did, write a courtesy thank you letter to the president/dean/boss whatever, it means a lot to them.

EDIT: When I graduated from high school, I wrote (typed) all of my high school teachers a thank you note because when I started 7th grade up until like 5 months before I actually graduated I was a self-conscious hunch backed nerd and it took a long time for me to hit my stride. And when I hit my stride I honestly looked back and appreciated all of the crap I had to put up from my teachers because in the end it shaped me to become a better person if I had taken the opportunity to take advantage of it. So I wrote them thank you letters, this LPT applies mainly to teachers, teaching is by and large a thankless job nowadays, if a child messes up its the teachers fault etc. It means a lot to them to know that they taught someone positively and that you appreciated the hours they put into your own life, even the crummy teachers."

It's long, so here's the tl;dr (I do suggest you read the entire thing, because even the full post is just a summary of the big picture):

The Greeks don't believe in zero - in fact, they think it's mathematical heresy and execute anyone who suggests it's real. Fast forward a few hundred years to the fall of Rome and the ascension of the Catholic Church as Europe's cultural core for a thousand years - wanting to recreate the glory of Rome, the Catholics and Europeans adopt the ""teachings of the ancients"" as the core of all truth. As a result, you get things like the Ptolemaic Model of the solar system, Platonic Duality of physical and spiritual, and a belief that zero is an affront to God himself.

Fast forward five hundred years to the beginnings of the Renaissance, during which education began to separate itself from religion (0AD-1000AD: if you're educated, you were educated by a monk). Suddenly, certain concepts - such as a non heliocentric solar system or a mathematical concept called ""zero"" - stop being taboo topics to discuss. Over the course of a century or so, people started rediscovering zero: and it changed *everything.*

Ever wonder why paintings from the middle ages look so flat, while paintings from the Renaissance onwards start getting a little depth of field? Thank zero. 3D perception is based on the idea that all lines in a reference frame converge on a singular point that is *infinity* away: you can't have infinity without zero. Because zero is now a thing, we can have concepts such as ""infinitely small.""

The rediscovery of zero was also a product of/cause for the development of calculus (zero/infinity and calculus go hand in hand). ~~Newton~~ Leibniz (Newton was a *hack!* His proofs were wrong!) was the first guy to figure out that, in order to have an *exact* value for the area under a curve, you need to make an *infinite* number of rectangular approximations. In order to have an infinite number of rectangles underneath the curve, you need their bases to be *zero.* But you can't divide by zero, so he came up with notation (which is used in calculus to this day: dy/dx) to work around the whole ""divide by zero"" error and figure out integration.

(Newton did the same thing, but he was a pussy and didn't use zero: he just used ""a number so small it's *practically* zero, which doesn't work. He's only credited with calculus because he ran a smear PR campaign against Leibniz and his prestige as a physicist meant that he won. But **fuck you, Newton,** nobody uses your notation and your models for physics aren't applicable to non-macroscopic objects, so suck it!).

And that's how the rediscovery of zero led to the Renaissance period of art, the development of calculus, and the destabilization of the Roman Catholic authority (which led to the Enlightenment).

There's a whole lot more that zero can be credited for, but, as I said, this is a tl;dr of a tl;dr. Most of my info comes from ""Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea"" by Charles Seife; it's a great, easy read that gives a lot of insights into just how influential the concept of ""nothing"" has been on the world (it even goes into the Eastern perspective a little bit).
