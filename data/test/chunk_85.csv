blackpony04,Buffalo,1390750198.0,If you think that you've obviously never lived anywhere else. Chicago looks like it's a great city but as a former 25 year resident of that area I can tell you that overpopulation sucks and the ease at which you can get around Buffalo should not be underestimated. And if you think you can afford to live in downtown Chicago and be near all of it's great venues you'd better be a millionaire or you're going to be forced to spend all of your time in the suburbs which I can tell you aren't much different than what you find in Buffalo for half the price.

Xnfbqnav,learndota2,1390750315.0,"Two things here. First off, on agi heroes, building agi ALSO builds damage. This is part of the reason so many agi heroes are considered carries (but not all!): for each point of agi you buy, you are buying damage and attack speed to augment that damage. So on Riki at level 6, for instance, and this is assuming no other items and no points into stats, you have a damage of 62-66 and attack .87 times per second.

If you buy the hammer, that gives you +24 damage, so you do 86-90 damage .87 times per second, or 74.82~78.3 DPS

If you buy a blade of alacrity, that gives you +10 agility, so you do 72-76 damage .93 times per second, or 66.96~70.68 DPS.

So with the mithril hammer, you're effectively buying an extra 8 DPS for 600 gold, which is hardly worth it when you have other things to buy too. But passive components are only part of an item. You can also combine them into greater items, with unique traits or special active abilities.

Let's look at what they upgrade into.

Mithril hammer can upgrade into Black King Bar, Maelstrom, or Desolator. Black King Bar is undoubtedly useful on Riki, and you will want to pick one up at some point. Maelstrom and Desolator are less so. On Riki you want to build a lot of agility to scale with your passive, so the pure attack speed and on hit modifier of Maelstrom is less than appealing, while Desolator is better off in the hands of someone else, although not a terrible pickup on Riki.

Blade of Alacrity can upgrade into Aghanim's Scepter, Diffusal Blade, or Yasha. Riki has absolutely no use for Agh's, but Diffusal and Yasha are huge for him. Diffusal has an active slow to keep people in your smoke clouds, a passive mana burn to prevent them from turning around on you quite as effectively, and it purges, allowing you to get rid of dust that has revealed you. Yasha, similarly, grants a healthy boost to your agility but also gives +10% move speed, meaning that if you jump on someone who's alone, you can be damn near sure that they need to turn around and fight you in order to not take massive damage from the back.

Black King Bar is huge, and you most certainly want one to keep you online in teamfights, but early on, you're going to want ways to secure kills as your main source of exp and gold are ganks as Riki."

Kiwi150,Meditation,1390750360.0,"&gt;My extensive experience says the exact opposite.

So you're claiming cannabis enhances your awareness? If this is true, why do you not use it while you meditate?

&gt;Just because you personally have had that experience with the plant doesn't make it hard and fast truth.

I apologize for coming off that way, but I wasn't claiming hard and fast truth, which is why I explicitly stated that I was speaking from extensive experience. Experience implies personal view.

&gt;but if people wish to use aids, be they substances, music, mantra etc. it shouldn't be 'frowned' upon

I said nothing of music, mantra or aids. I was speaking of intoxicants.

&gt;That's where dogma begins.

I understand dogma can be detrimental in some cases, but this is not one of them. This (Buddhist) dogma is a practical one, and is in place because intoxicants generally inhibit your ability to preform meditation properly."

1.  Those that think man pages are already the best possible resource.  They are complete, and to them, easy to ready.
2.  Those that think man pages are long and intimidating, and possibly a barrier to using the CLI tools that the first group is using as if they were extensions of their arms.

If this is a real problem, which is debatable, perhaps there should be real effort to make man pages be a lower barrier to entry for certain tool sets.  I know I'd prefer to have more of the junior programmers I know be growing their magic shell powers."

As much work as it will be you need to continue to set up boundaries with her. You also are going to need to set some up boundaries for yourself. If you cannot handle these conversations with her, do not have them. And do not allow her to bully you into having them.

What happens, then, is that the middle manager gets his numbers seen, they promote him. Then the next guy who takes over realizes how fucked everything is, all the problems that the first man caused come out, it all gets blamed on the new guy, and he gets fired.

This is classic stuff. It's how I think almost all of corporate America works. It's primarily because everything is based on numbers or sales goals in the short term rather than ""real"" growth or sustainability. A lot of middle managers shoot for Pyrrhic victories and then get promoted only to sabotage everyone else, knowingly or not.

In short: I agree with you. But it is not the managers fault. It is the corporate culture that causes this kind of thing. The worst part is, it makes sense from 'upstairs'. The numbers look great, they don't know the small details. So then it also makes sense when the next guy comes in, the numbers tank, and they blame him for it."

The fact that they don't ask about it or don't find it interesting or amusing suggests that THEY have a problem. It might be that they are actually feeling a bit anxious or awkward and they don't know how to react. Your confidence may be a bit intimidating to them. Don't feel you have to tone it down for them though, it's THEIR problem not yours. They need to be overwhelmed slightly to help them get over their anxiousness. You're doing them a favour.

People with guns are able to travel, so the place where a shooting occurs may not necessarily be a rough area (Hell there was a shooting in Columbia Mall yesterday, and that area isn't that bad).

TheLittleGoodWolf,IAmA,1390751139.0,"&gt;Too few men reported rape in the 12 months prior to taking the survey to produce a reliable 12 month prevalence estimate.

Because the definition of rape was ""forced penetration"" not being ""forced to penetrate"". Too few men reported being forcibly penetrated for form an accurate statistic of such a thing in the latest 12 month period. There is also the obvious exclusion of people in prison where it's widely acknowledged that male rape (forced penetration) is relatively common. I am far to tired to find sources of this so I won't mention it again or take it into account hereafter. The question deals with the study and it's results alone.

About the difference between lifetime and recent reporting. The figures don't add up at all. Interpreting these numbers would mean that from existing data there has been a huge increase of men being forced to penetrate recently right? In the last year there were as many men reporting being forced to penetrate as women reporting being raped. Yet the lifetime estimates of the figures are vastly different. How is this? was 2009 just a fluke year for men? The difference is similar in the other figures as well. Are the figures for the previous 12 moths irrelevant? Why are they even represented then?

I will just go ahead and classify ""made to penetrate"" as rape hereafter (unless otherwise specified) since there will be no real change in the actual numbers I feel safe to do so. There were no numbers for women forced to penetrate and no numbers on men being raped in the last 12 months of the study. I'll also just go ahead and ignore (for now) the 1.4% of lifetime male reports of rape (forced penetration) for the sake of it all.

4.8% of men report being raped in their lifetime, 1.1% of men report being raped within the last 12 months. This means that (rounding the numbers) approximately 20% of raped men were raped within the last 12 months. The question is whether being raped within the last 12 months makes you eligible to be in the lifetime bracket as well.

18.3% of women report being raped in their lifetime while 1.1% report being raped within the last 12 months. This means that (rounding the numbers) approximately 5.6% of raped women were raped within the last 12 months.

Regardless of how you look at it in the last 12 months there were approximately just as many men raped as there were women raped.

From the study itself:
&gt;Twelve-month prevalence estimates provide a snapshot of the recent
burden of violence in a population.

Shouldn't we be concerned about what happens now as opposed to what happened before?

The question here was not about other kinds of sexual assault of violence it was about rape and how ""forced penetration"" is not statistically considered to be rape. Such a figure greatly changes a persons outlook on society.

kicker7955,europe,1390751141.0,"&gt;It's not as if there's not competition possible within ecological limits. That doesn't address the results on power consumption either.

This is quite a complex, issue and I could go further in if you'd like, the main issue is real markets don't work like macreconomic models, IRL a company will use every chance it has to maximize profits, and regulation changes are the perfect opportunities to raise the whole market. If we where talking about a lot of suppliers i.e. bread market, then a cartel behavior would be more difficult(not impossible, as my country proved this in the fall of last year). when you have a handfull of producers a cartel behavior is certain, and due to the regulatory shifts it is imposible to prove without auditing the companies that this behavior took place.

&gt;We have to get rid of the idea that using more power automatically means better performance, and these norms are a good step in that direction. They have to compete on performance, not on powersucking.

Using less power = less performance, you can use a lot of power and have low performance , but technologically the balance of performance vs power consumption is reached by high end devices that are very expensive, the industry can't literally get better performances using current technology.

http://www.greenoptimistic.com/2011/12/29/europe-co2-emissions-2012/

is it enough? or do you want the actual law?

here you go http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACEA_agreement

engine emisions are a direct consequence of consumtion, consumtion goes down with weight, the heaviest component of a car is the engine, smaller engines= less powerfull engines, because the we don't have the tehnology to not compromise on power.

 this move in practice meant keeping the class categories i.e. small hatch of 9 000 euros is now is made of cheap plastic and has a 1 000 cc engine, good(debatably) for the enviroment, good for eu politicians that seek idealist green voters, good for the company(cheaper car sold for the same money), bad for consumers that need to climb hills.

I was protesting the cheap cars, that we're usable before these regulations. No that doesn't mean that, but we do not have the technology to build a affordable ecological car. 

I expect the consumer to not be fucked over beacause of his naivete, I expect usable products not ""politically correct"" useless products that may not even effect the environment at all only make politicians and companies look concerned.

I read a great article that went more in debt on all ""eco tech"" and  what a sham they are but this will suffice.

1wiseguy,space,1390751234.0,"Perhaps you're not an engineer, and you don't solve problems like this. I can explain:

We want to send a spacecraft to another star systems. The closest one that anybody believes has a suitable planet is 22 light years away. That means we need to travel at a moderate fraction of the speed of light, say 10%. Then the trip would take 220 years. That seems like a really long time to me, but let's see if that is even feasible.

Let's say the total mass of the spacecraft is 1 million kg, about 10 space shuttles. It's an arbitrary size, actually.

We're going to assume that 40% of that mass is U-235, only half of which can be used for acceleration, the remainder for deceleration.

So what speed can we attain? The total energy you can derive is 200,000 * 83.14 TJ/kg = 16.6 E18 J. I'm going to assume 100% efficiency in converting that into speed, just to be generous. So that energy will equal 0.5 * m * v^2. If we solve for v, we get 5.77 million m/s, or 2% of the speed of light.

If that actually worked, the trip would take over 1000 years. However, that model is based on 100% efficiency of the engines, which is surely not realistic, so the real trip would be even longer.

Note that I am not designing the whole spacecraft with this simple equation, as you seem to imply; I just showing that the concept isn't practical. I also don't claim to be the smartest person in the universe, but there are some things I can figure out.

Do you see any issues with my calculation? Did I miss something?"

Basically I want to baja the rear of the car, and then leave the front fenderless with full hood and apron. 

I am currently building that bug; in stages of course. Currently I have the back chopped off, and the fenders removed, and lowered three spines in the back, and as far as my adjustable beam will let me go in the front. It is not and will not be narrowed...ever, I like the handling of a beetle. I will be running fender-less with dietz style headlights and some form of taillights bolted to the rear. Then once I save up I will purchase the baja kit and have it painted to match my car. 

Engine is going to be simple. Stock displacement 1600 built to scream. I will be spinning in excess of 7000 RPM's across a counter weighted crank with DRD heads and dual 40's.

When you have a return policy on your listing, if the buyer contacts either you or opens a case within 14 days of the delivery date when there is tracking, or the estimated delivery date if there is no tracking, then a buyer may return the item for any reason. 

In a claim of an item not as described case, a buyer has 30 days to open a case from the date of delivery, or if no tracking, the estimated delivery date. 

If an item is deemed not as described and the buyer opens a case within that timeframe (30 day), they can still return the item for a refund. 

So I'll ask again. When did the buyer contact you or open a case to initiate the return? If they contacted you within 14 days of the confirmation delivery date, then they would have been able to return the item for any reason, including buyers remorse.

I have posted my stunting bike for sale on my favorite stunting website- http://www.stunting.com, so if you are interested in stunting, you can get started right away in the world of stunting. 

Say stunting one more time, doesn't it sound weird?"

Those were weird times. We're still friends, but I lost my feelings for her after she told me she was dating a guy ""she was probably going to break up with but was giving him a chance because she felt sorry for him.""

My partner has Nparents. I do think they feel love for him. But feeling love for someone is not enough. How are they supposed to know if you never show them? Because saying it isn't enough.

The biggest issue we have it that they love themselves the most and then each other next. They only really show love for the kids when it is not too much work for them or when it works in their favor. 

For me and my partner, love is an action and for it to be felt by a person it must be expressed as an action. A hug, a listening ear, you see a candy bar you know they love and decide to buy it for them just because. 

His parents are not capable of this. They do something and immediately expect something bigger and better from him. They will do things ""out of love"" just so he owes them one. The will even remind him of it when they want to cash in. And that is not love."

So it sounds more like you're on the ""don't want to lose her and are trying to come to grips"" side of things. That's good.

&gt;I was thinking maybe over the years I have just gotton so stuck in the routine of school, work, school, work (im insanely busy) that I just need more excitement back into the equation. 

That could definitely be a part of it. Getting stuck in a rut or a routine with very little variance is a prime recipe for boredom no matter WHAT is going on in your life. 
&gt;the thought occured maybe we could start smoking weed and having sex together (something ive always found very exciting as well as meaningful), but she has alreadu told me she has never tried weed and doesn't want t. MDMA is also amazingly romantic for couples to do on special occasions while being little exciting/bad... but if shes not for weed this would sound like insanity too her. 

ehhh, while I'd definitely say it's a good idea to shake things up a little I don't think I'd turn to drugs as my first idea. You're right that if she isn't down with weed she is really unlikely to want to try other drugs. Do you guys have any mutual free time where you could do stuff together, maybe some free hours on the weekend where you could go out and try some new things like new restaurants or museums or concerts? Or maybe take a day trip somewhere you haven't been.

&gt; counseling is happening soon

that's good, and if you're seriously thinking about getting married, then I'd say that it might be a good idea to get some kind of couple's counseling/premarital counseling as well. Those aren't just for people with problems already, they're to try and prevent problems happening in future and especially counseling for couples planning to marry, it can be very helpful to get you to figure out how to work through issues in the future that might arise.

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1390751910.0,"&gt;I never said people would have no desire to do those things. I said everyone does not consider being your definition of successfully social or sexual to be the pinnacle of existence.

I never posited that young people consider those things ""the pinnacle of existance""; I posited that young people consider those things the most desirable lifestyle. Maybe they think the pinnacle of existance is being a successful astronaut...they aren't going to be an astronaut at 20 years old anytime soon. 

&gt; and not getting enough sex at 20 isn't something that can't be rectified later.

I disagree, but that's a whole different topic on human attraction and sexuality.

&gt;The young people who are obsessed with social status are generally insecure and inexperienced, like a lot of young people, and seek validation in others.

Not really. Everyone seeks validation from others. If everyone was an alpha capable of self validation, everyone would be an alpha capable of self validation.

&gt;That's so common as to be a trope of youth, and is hardly ""successful."" It's something people try to overcome as they get older and learn more about what they really want.

Success is defined in the context of the group. If 99% of people are exactly like you, it doesn't matter if the douchebag star athlete also seeks the validation of others, he's still seeking validation as a star athlete with a fuck load more social status than you. 

&gt;ETA: ""I want everyone to like me"" and ""I want to fuck everyone I can"" seem like pretty shallow goals, don't you think?

People are pretty generally the shallowest of animals. People give people too much credit in reward for false virtue. "

Feroc,DebateReligion,1390751938.0,"&gt; First off god is not Harry potter and calling or referring to god as such is intellectual dishonest just on the premise that what you are describing/comparing is no where near similar.

Both are stories written in books. Take Star Wars if you prefer that, there is even a religion around that. The prove for both being real is the same. 

&gt; God is a concept that the very very very large majority of humanity has came to believe in after being left to their own devices in one way or another and Harry potter isn't.

God is not **a** concept. God is just the name for many concepts, there is not **the** god, there are many different stories about many different gods who all work in other ways. 

&gt; And you by no means know whether or not god has given proof of his existence to people.

Proof is either correct or it isn't. There is no such thing as ""proof to some people"". Because those people would be able to repeat the proof that god has given to them.

&gt; And saying that because the idea of god out side of religion is vague and that it means it's meaningless and deserves no consideration is like saying that quantum mechanics is hard so we should stop working on understanding it.... That's not the position of a ""freethinker.""

Quantum mechanics is a defined thing. The word god on the other hand is just an umbrella term with very less properties. That's like saying ""a myth could be true"" without even saying which myth you mean. Ask a pantheist what god is and he will tell you about the nature, in this definition god is true, because nature is true, but it's just a word given a completely different definition."

She told me that she had once been serving soup to a table, and one of the guys tried to help her by taking a plate off her arm when she was already placing a bowl in front of someone. As any server will tell you, you don't mess with someone's plate balancing. He managed to knock two bowls of hot soup all over his elderly mother.

Edit: Just remembered a spillage of mine. I was working in a bar with an overhead glass shelf (I freaking hate those things) and while reaching for a pint mug I knocked a glass off the shelf right in front of my oldest regular, Sean. It smashed his pint of Guinness AND his glass of red wine AND his bowl of chips, and showered us both with glass. Fortunately Sean was a dude and was really nice about it, especially as he now had two young barmaids carefully picking glass off his jacket. Sean was in his 90's and came in every day for two pints of Guinness and a small glass of red wine. He was collected every afternoon by a gaggle of beautiful Thai women who would treat him like the lord of the manor. The story went that he'd married a mail order bride, who had brought all her sisters over with her. He didn't mind a bit."

bummedoutbride,Dogtraining,1390752129.0,"There is no panting or pacing. Just whining.

When I am in the house with the dog and my husband is in the garage, I have observed her body language. She lays outside the door to the garage, front paws outstretched, and makes the ""hooo hoooo"" whine noise. It's not a loud or deep noise, just a ""whoa is me""-type thing. I haven't been paying a ton of attention to her ears, but my first reaction is to say her ears are pulled back when she does this. I'll have to keep observing. After she whines for a minute or two, she'll put her head between her front paws, like ""sigh, I have the hardest life ever.""

No, she does not lose her shit when we come back inside. She'll just stand up and get her tennis ball, the way she does when she ""greets us"" when we come home from work.  

If I'm inside the house when she's whining at my husband in the garage, I do not pet or comfort her when she's whining. I do sometimes gently say to her ""Hey girl, it's okay. Go lay down"" and point to her bed (which is her ""safe spot""). She will always follow my command, and go lay down in her bed, so I pet her and praise her for going to her bed. But she won't stay there very long if my husband is in the garage â maybe 5-10 minutes. As soon as she hears a noise come from the garage, she gets up and lays down by the door again. 

My thought process behind this is I want to show her what I *want* her to do, instead of punishing her for whining. However, it doesn't seem to stick.

Your response made me think, though. Maybe me or my husband *are* petting her when we *both* come back inside from the garage, which could totally be rewarding her whining. I can't believe I didn't think of something so obvious. 

Yes, I would like to hear about the exercise you mentioned. Thanks for responding!

PS: I hope this isn't confusing â there are two separate situations here regarding the garage whining. One is if my husband and I are both in the garage and the dog whines (we definitely can't see her body language in this scenario). The other is if I am in the house with the dog, and my husband is in the garage â that's when I've been telling her to ""go lay down."" Hope this makes sense."

They see someone having a hard time coping with a death or with their place in a world devoid of intrinsic meaning and explain the bullshit they know to be true. It doesn't matter if one is objectively verifiable and the other must be completely believed on faith alone - religious people KNOW that they have found peace and meaning through this faith and KNOW you can too.

devonclaire,Dogtraining,1390752715.0,"A few questions for you: 

(1) Has he been checked out by a vet for anything other than heartworms? There are a lot of medical conditions that can cause a dog to lose his appetite. If he hasn't had a full vet exam since he started refusing food, you should make an appointment NOW and tell the vet what's going on. 

(2) Is he refusing food both at your house and at your friend's house?

If the answer to (1) is yes, he's been cleared by the vet, then I would stop free feeding all together, and instead, feed him at regular intervals at the same time every day. I feed my dog right after her morning walk, and then again after her evening walk. (She also gets a few treats during the day when we do training sessions.)

If your dog refuses food at a specified meal time, leave the bowl out for 15 minutes. If he still hasn't eaten, then take the food bowl away for an hour or so, and then set out the bowl again. If he doesn't eat, put the food bowl away and try again at the next meal. Learning to eat at regular intervals, on *your schedule*, is much better for a dog. If there's always food out, then a dog can over eat, or under eat, and it's much harder for dogs to self-regulate their food intake than it is for, say, a cat. You will also need to get your friend/dogsitter on the same feeding schedule as you, so his food intake is consistent.

Katterin,Netrunner,1390752749.0,"You know, I was going to quote the instructions at you to disagree, but now I think you may be right in your other comment that they are simultaneous effects.

On page 33, timing structure of a run, access is step 4.5. The words ""If an AGENDA is accessed, the Runner STEALS it"" are below the words ""Access cards, then go to [5]"", but it is all part of the same step.  Similarly on the flow chart on page 36, there is one box that says

**Access Cards:** 

    Rez cards.
    Run is successful
    Access Cards
    End Run

Stealing is not a separate step, it is part of access.  So, being able to steal the card and taking the net damage are two effects that both happen as part of the access stage.  

The question is who gets to choose the order.  The rules on simultaneous effects say that each player chooses the order in which his own abilities trigger, and if both players have simultaneous effects, then the person whose turn it is decides (page 22).  So if ""access"" and ""steal"" are simultaneous events rather than sequential, as I now believe they are, then the win goes through for the runner before the flatline.

silverionmox,polandball,1390753060.0,"&gt; Congo was decimated by Belgium. The Belgians managed to kill half the population through exploitation and introduced diseases.

Congo was a multinational corporation based in Belgium. The period of Belgian rule was the most stable and prosperous of its colonial and post-colonial history.

&gt;This is just over hundred years ago since then democratic elections have been destabilised by belgian and american security forces.

What went wrong after independence? 

- There was a mutiny in the army. Lumumba reacted to that by dismissing all remaining white officers and replacing them by black ones, who, due to the breakneck pace of independence, also were untrained.

- There were some violent incidents and rapes of white women, which weren't adequately contained due to the inexperienced army. This resulted in a general exodus of the remaining Belgians, with or without plans to come back later when things calmed down. The consequences was a drain of technological and management expertise.

- After the first 5 deaths the Belgian government decided to intervene militarily to evacuate the remaining Belgians, resulting in sending the army to Congo. Two days later, Tshombe proclaimed the independece of Katanga. The torture and abuse of hundreds of Belgians continued.

Which decisions in particular are outrageous? How can you put the blame on a single party? 

&gt;Since then the CIA has been a constant source of destabilisation. Swiss and Canadian Mining companies have been complicit in War Crimes. European and American companies have colluded in gorging on Congos resources whilst 5 million people have died in the never ending war caused by the demand for Congos abundant mineral wealth. 

How is that Belgium's responsibility? The whole point of becoming independent is taking your own decisions and risks. They wanted independence, they got it.

&gt;. You really think the average Congolese person has anyway of preventing the armed militias running amok when they are rich from the proceeds of diamonds and coltan bought without scruples by the worlds mainstream companies.

You really think the average Belgian has any more influence?

&gt;However in all this the Belgians have to take the lions share of the blame they are responsible for one of the worlds worst genocides.

Again, Congo was a multinational corporation based in Belgium. The period of Belgian rule was the most stable and prosperous of its colonial and post-colonial history.

&gt;They then successfully fucked up Congo's attempt at democracy as their leaving present and as a thank you for decades of terrible colonialism.

Lumumba was properly elected and in power when the Belgians left. They only returned when the remaining Belgians were endangered.

&gt;They still as a nation have made no effort to accept responsibility for either this is the issue. It is not Belgians alive today who were responsible but they must as a nation face up to their countries responsibility in absolute horror on an industrial scale. So that like the holocaust we can say it will never be forgotten.

Most Belgians weren't even born when Congo became independent, and the rest hasn't ever been there so your notion of collective inheritable punishment is a feuding mentality that is the cause of the world's worst conflicts.

But assuming you stick to that ridiculous notion, are you going to face up responsibility for the crimes of the British Empire then? Genocide, warmongering, slavery, exploitation,... all over the world, from nextdoor in Ireland to the outskirts of the world in Tasmania."

The_British_One,skiing,1390753414.0,"Honestly I'm not sure if it's worth only going for 2 days, depending on where you're coming from, but whatever floats your boat. 

You should be able to rent skis, poles, boots, helmets etc. in the resort. 

Take warm clothes. Base layers/2nd skins, fleeces, obviously ski jackets and whatnot. 

If there's anywhere near you to get your wife some lessons that would be worth it. Just a couple of hours and she should be at least able to turn and stop and use the lifts. Otherwise you'd have to get lessons while there (unless that's your intention, I don't know). 

You could possibly do some basic fitness but by the sounds of it your fitness level won't have much of an effect at your level yet, so probably don't need to worry about that. 

It's hard to think of anything else really because you're quite vague on your situation. Be prepared to pay a large amount for food, especially up the mountain. "

Think about a rivalry between two great male boxers. They usually want to tear the other guy's head off but undoubtedly there's a great deal of respect between the two. That's because in the male world, you are respected for one thing and one thing only; your ability to perform. Both boxers know the other is ""almost"" as good as he is.

A lot of basketball fans hate Lebron James. How many of them respect him for what he brings to the sport? My guess is just about all of them.

You also don't always have to act like a ""manly way"", i.e confrontational and tough, to get a man's respect. That will only work if it relates to your ability to perform. Otherwise you just seem like a bitch.

Something else to consider: your standards for what it takes to get respect might be different because you're a girl. But it could go either way. ""Wow, she can do that AND she's a girl? Respect"" or ""Yeah she can do that but she's still just a girl. She will need to do more"". It depends on the guy.

&gt;Now that I have to become self reliant and a useful person to the community what can I do to be taken seriously now and through adulthood?

What makes you think you need to earn a male form of respect in order to be ""taken seriously""? "

Katterin,Netrunner,1390753474.0,"I'm a little bit more confused than ever now, though. See my other comment to /u/WabiSabiWill:

You know, I was going to quote the instructions at you to disagree, but now I think you may be right in your other comment that they are simultaneous effects.

On page 33, timing structure of a run, access is step 4.5. The words ""If an AGENDA is accessed, the Runner STEALS it"" are below the words ""Access cards, then go to [5]"", but it is all part of the same step.  Similarly on the flow chart on page 36, there is one box that says

**Access Cards:** 

    Rez cards.
    Run is successful
    Access Cards
    End Run

Stealing is not a separate step, it is part of access.  So, being able to steal the card and taking the net damage are two effects that both happen as part of the access stage.  

The question is who gets to choose the order.  The rules on simultaneous effects say that each player chooses the order in which his own abilities trigger, and if both players have simultaneous effects, then the person whose turn it is decides (page 22).  So if ""access"" and ""steal"" are simultaneous events rather than sequential, as I now believe they are, then the win goes through for the runner before the flatline."

Um, yes you did. Let's look up a bit. You said:

&gt;if you're not spending it being social, and being sexual, and being successful at both, you've wasted the best time of your existence.

The ""best time of your existence."" You know, the pinnacle. If you were implying that only YOU think that's the best time but young people don't... that makes your entire argument even more confusing.

&gt;Not really. Everyone seeks validation from others. 

Obviously, but young people do it much, much more.

&gt;Success is defined in the context of the group. 

No, it isn't. This seems to be where we completely disagree. You're very hung up on social status as if that even matters, as if you can't define your own success in life. I've no idea why this is. For many people it's not the case, especially as they grow older and realize what a waste of time it is. Obviously everyone has to act within a social framework of acceptable behavior, but beyond that social ""status"" is only as relevant as you make it in your life. 

Regardless, I don't see us gaining any ground continuing. We're at total opposite ends of this and just moving farther apart. Best of luck with your contemplations. "

In Portland, where it is damp or downright soaked for a vast majority of the year, they are building ""homes"" with no rain gutters, no moisture barriers, no foundation ... and I can only hope that the floor framing consists of treated wood, but even that will begin to degrade in just a couple of years with constant exposure to the elements.

I was never good enough.  Anything in the world that upset him was my fault.  I was not his ex.  I was not as pretty as his ex and my boobs were definitely not the same size as hers, how dare I claim to have a D-cup.  No, I'm wrong and he is right about everything.  Even if I repeat something he said, he would change his mind so he could be right.  

He was an economist, it was his job not to care about anyone but himself [he literally said this to me regularly]

He made me so dependent on him that he would call me every horrible name in the book and I would go crawling back.  

All I did was cry.  

How dare I want sex when he didn't....was I a s**t or something?  How could I not be satisfied with having sex whenever he wanted to?  What was wrong with me.

No, I wasn't allowed to identify as queer because that means he will never be enough for me.  

I wasn't allowed to go to my family events without him unless I wanted a huge fight.  I wasn't allowed to hang out with my friends unless I gave him a week notice so that he could have plans.  Any time I made plans less than a week in advance he would get upset because he had wanted to come over that day and assumed I would be free.  

How dare I get a better GPA than him.  It was my fault he wasn't doing as well as I was in school.  I was in a bullshit major, I had coped out.  My major means nothing, his means everything.  [anthropology vs economics if you're curious]

When I finally stayed away and I had just started things with my lovely, amazing boyfriend, he felt the need to come back into my life just long enough to ensure me that yes, I had loved him immensely and he had cheated on me with the ex I was never as good as a few times and he slept with someone else on my birthday while I was in my bedroom sobbing.

He tries to text me out of nowhere as an excuse to try to rub my face in his new relationship.  He's dating a girl half a country away after assuring me that my 70 miles apart relationship will never work.

I'm with someone else and so unbelievably happy and he still has to try to exert control.

Here is what to do in the meantime - call your mortgage company and ask about applying for a loan modification. Depending on your loan origination date (either when you initially purchased the home or when your last refinance was) you might be able to modify the loan to get a more affordable payment. Most banks won't accept partial payments at all, and if you become delinquent, they likely won't accept anything but the total amount due. If you are underwater on your mortgage and interested in selling the home, you might want to look into a short sale as well. Short sales can be tedious and stressful, but you can often sell the property in as-is condition and not have to worry about that. You will need a realtor in that scenario. 

Best of luck."

Now, that only works if the image is exactly (binary) the same as the one in the database.  
imgur is great, you know, but in an attempt to save space, it tries to compress everything uploaded to it. It also doesn't save the original hash anywhere. So if an image is uploaded to imgur, my bot doesn't find it in the database.

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1390754244.0,"&gt; many feminists and non-feminists alike often find that women in video games are hypersexualized to cater to a male demographic. 

As long as people have the right to choose, without social pressure, I'm fine with slutty clothing. 

&gt; I feel like male sexuality is constantly demonized in discussions about women in video games. 

I agree. Men cannot control their sex drive, but they can control their actions. Instead of raping and pillaging in real life, they play video games with scantily-clothed women. Honestly, most men don't want to rape anyone. But they do need an outlet for their sex drive. 

Most women IME don't sex shame men, but enough do to imprint this on a guy's memory, and make him feel like he's broken, or an animal. Frankly, some of my girlfriends loved me as an animal. 


But as a guy I have few slutty clothing options. Tight pants or shorts, and tight tshirt, only available in the summer. That's all I can think of.

komnenos,AskMen,1390754258.0,"To be honest it happens every once in a while.  I dated a nice very attractive girl over the summer.  I did picture what it would have been like to be her, the life she led (college sorority girl) was one of ease.  Everything was handed to her, she never paid for meals, drinks, rides, etc. and everyone gave her the benefit of a doubt because of her gender.  Everything just seemed to be easy for her.  

After she and I went our separate ways it began to happen more and more.  Whenever I saw a girl I would picture how easy her life was, how everything was handed to her and how truthfully I would take that any day being her over being a guy.  I'm not gay or wear flamboyant clothes or cross dress but deep in side I wonder if it would have been better if I was born into the opposite gender.  Even though I put on a facade of conformity I feel that I just don't ""think"" the same way as most other guys do.  I don't constantly think about banging chicks, I barely look at women (even attractive ones) in the first place.  I've thought about how if I was a woman I more then likely would never have to ask a guy out.  I've had friends and acquaintances tell me that if I want to ""get"" with more girls I need to keep asking girls until I get blue in the face but truthfully I just don't find many of them attractive both physically or (more importantly) mentally.  One of the things I absolutely detest about being a guy is how I always have to take the initiative. Hell one thing that bugs me to know end as a guy is that even girls who I KNEW had crushes on me expected me to ask them out.  I thought of how easy it would be to go out with people as a woman, how I could pick and choose at my leisure and expect guys to ask me out.

Fortunately after half a year of that I did say fuck it and asked my best friend out.  I'm glad she's the one who said yes.  At the moment I'm satisfied with my gender.    "

silverionmox,europe,1390754660.0,"&gt; This is quite a complex, issue and I could go further in if you'd like, the main issue is real markets don't work like macreconomic models, IRL a company will use every chance it has to maximize profits, and regulation changes are the perfect opportunities to raise the whole market. If we where talking about a lot of suppliers i.e. bread market, then a cartel behavior would be more difficult(not impossible, as my country proved this in the fall of last year). when you have a handfull of producers a cartel behavior is certain, and due to the regulatory shifts it is imposible to prove without auditing the companies that this behavior took place.

There are thousands of vacuum cleaner producers.

&gt;Using less power = less performance, you can use a lot of power and have low performance , but technologically the balance of performance vs power consumption is reached by high end devices that are very expensive, the industry can't literally get better performances using current technology.

If true, then they'll have a great incentive to improve technology, which is a good thing.

&gt;is it enough? or do you want the actual law?
here you go http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACEA_agreement

There's nothing at all in your links about a limitation of 1l., just a limitation of CO2 exhaust. They can achieve that any way they want.

&gt;this move in practice meant keeping the class categories i.e. small hatch of 9 000 euros is now is made of cheap plastic and has a 1 000 cc engine, good(debatably) for the enviroment, good for eu politicians that seek idealist green voters, good for the company(cheaper car sold for the same money), bad for consumers that need to climb hills.

Pricing is the responsibility of the company, not the EU.

&gt;I was protesting the cheap cars, that we're usable before these regulations. No that doesn't mean that, but we do not have the technology to build a affordable ecological car.
I expect the consumer to not be fucked over beacause of his naivete, I expect usable products not ""politically correct"" useless products that may not even effect the environment at all only make politicians and companies look concerned.

But even assuming that it's impossible to build a cheap ecological car, then it's still a good result that the real ecological costs of a car are now visible in its price.

&gt;I read a great article that went more in debt on all ""eco tech"" and what a sham they are but this will suffice.
http://www.environmentalleader.com/2013/07/05/electric-cars-actually-dirtier-than-gasoline-cars/

Lifecycle analyses are heavily dependent on current production practices, and change along with them. For example, as we shift electricity production towards renewables their indirect CO2 emissions will also dwindle. Therefore you can't just make a blanket judgment about electric cars, separate from any context.

You also can't lump together various pollution effects on a single scale.

Another issue is the application for those electric cars. The picture is a whole lot different whether you use that car for short trips in the city vs. long trips on a hilly highway. At this point it's undoubtedly true that in the latter situation a gasoline engine is better suited... but also that an electric vehicle is better suited in the first case.

And I do agree with the most important conclusion of the article you cited: bicycling is by far the most preferred method of transportation and should get precedence everywhere. But I'm sure that won't address your hill problem either :)

(There are some damning critical comments below the article as well, check them out.)

amantelascio,AskWomen,1390754796.0,"My paternal grandmother who had basically been a better mother than mine had been my entire life.  I was...10th grade.  

It was even more horrible because she went into the hospital right after Christmas because she wasn't feeling well and I was asleep when my parents rushed to the hospital with her and my grandfather.  

I wasn't allowed to visit her in the ER because of my age.  She was admitted, but the next day when visiting hours were, she got very aggressive and my grandfather didn't want me and my cousin to see her.  She was in a coma that night.  

We spent the next week being told that she was okay...no she wouldn't wake up...they expected a full recovery...her kidneys were failing.  My grandfather decided she had been given enough time to fight, she was tired, and she needed rest, so he pulled the plug.  It was New Years Eve and we had spent every single day basically living at the hospital ICU family room.  We had taken over, various members would show up when they could.  

I wore purple to her funeral because she always hated how much black I wore and she loved that dress on me.  I'm still angry at myself for somehow losing the ring she wore everyday that my grandfather gave me at her funeral.  

This was the first New Years Eve since that I didn't want to hide in a corner and sob because of how much I miss her.  I still cry some days because of how much I could use her, how happy she would be with where I am now, how much she would love my boyfriend, how amazed she would be with my cousin who is 5 now and so smart.  My older cousin and I started sobbing harder when we realized our baby cousin would not even remember our grandmother, this amazing woman she would never have in her life.

I coped by pushing through.  This is honestly what dragged me out of my loss-of-all-feeling depression with full-on-everything-hurts depression.

My grandfather got really sick and almost died about 6 months after, so that distracted everyone from the loss as much as it reminded us of it.  

Time, time is all I have found to help.  That and not to ignore or hide your pain.  My life is lesser without her in it, but I have other amazing people who need me and I can't stop my life to mourn.

It will hurt less often, I can promise you that.  I don't know if it really hurts less when it does come around.  But this is not the end of your life, it will continue with you in it, and the person you lost would not want you to be lost as well."

Our d-line went from four one-gapping down linemen with DEs playing 9-technique every down, to three two-gapping read-and-react down linemen, and did fine even though we didn't really have the personnel for the NT spot.

For just a few short while ago, Grimstad was a leading harbour in norwegian shipping and shipbuilding. The town sent goods and people to distant corners of the world and exotic oceans. There was gold, incense and riches. Grimstad truly was a good place to live.

But the townspeople became haughty and turned their backs to the true lord of the ocean, and temples of strange gods were built. Cthulhus punishment descended over the now sleepy town. Inbreeding, binge drinking, poor municipal economy and shut down toyfactories were the new reality.

We must do something about this! We must reinstate the faith of Cthulhu!

The goal of the campaign is to get Grimstad municipal to raise a 34 meter tall statue of Cthulhu infront of the shut down post office. Here the residents can bring their offerings and worship as it pleases them. Let us no longer be slaves of the vulgar tourists, but offer them Cthulhu!

Lurker117,keto,1390755665.0,"Great advice here in the comments.  There is one thing that hasn't been said yet.  If you truly want to be successful at this and lose weight, at some point you are going to have to ""man-up"" (or woman-up) and put down the food that made you fat.  That was one of the hardest things for me, because it involves some intense introspection and soul-searching.  I guess this is a major step for any diet, but it certainly was a key for me sticking to keto and losing over 120 lbs. so far.

I know and understand how hard it can be to break an addiction to food that has probably spanned decades for you.  Whatever your achilles heel is, it's the first thing you have to attack head-on to get the ball rolling towards a healthier you.  For you, it's the sugar.  I know some folks subscribe to tricking yourself by drinking diet soda, or sugar-free snack alternatives.  I'm not going to say they are right or wrong.  I know for me that was not an option.  It left too many doors open for me to sneak back to the bad foods that got me fat in the first place.  

The single biggest thing I did to be successful so far has been to realize that I have already made enough bad food decisions over the previous years that got me this way.  I've already had too many desserts, too many late-night binge meals, too many meals big enough for two people.  And yes, those were lots of fun to a person like me who loved food so much.  But now, it was time to pay the piper.  This part was not going to be fun, but it was necessary.  Once I was able to put that into perspective, it became easier to forgo the things that got me fat in the first place.

The great part is, even though I started this weight-loss journey as a solution to a problem, it has morphed into a complete lifestyle change over the past year.  Once you start seeing the results, you really do become addicted to success and want to see more and more.  Now I have adapted my diet to what I know works for me, and it is a diet I can maintain forever without feeling as though I am cheating myself.  But I personally had to go scorched earth in the beginning to break that terrible cycle that got me so unhealthy in the first place.

Sorry for the wall of text.  I know where you are coming from and wanted to give you some different perspective from somebody coming out the other side of it.  The bottom line is, whether you decide keto is right for you or not, if you don't muster up the willpower to go a single day without a sugar-fix, you are not going to be successful.  I want you to be successful, you have to will yourself away from that crap, it's what made you fat.  It's the reason that you are on a website asking for help about your weight instead of doing literally anything else that you want to do.  It hasn't done you any favors, you have to let it go to get where you want to be."
Eagle-Eye-Smith,Israel,1390755666.0,"Nope. This is not feasible at this point.

You're talking about millions (likely around 5 million) of refugees all getting Israeli citizenship at once. We don't have the economy to support this. Almost no nation **on earth** has the economy to support such large scale immigration, even if only half of the Palestinians decide to immigrate. We experienced a housing crisis when the USSR broke up and hundreds of thousands (eventually over a million) immigrants arrived to the country. There were not enough jobs to support all of them, and for a while, their economic state was abysmal. **And this happened with Jewish immigrants**, a lot of them with higher education and good job experience.

If Palestinians are given the right of return, we would literally not have enough jobs, houses or goods to support them all. And i'm not even going to mention the racism they will face, from both the establishment and the Jewish Israeli society, as well as probably racism from their side to the Jewish one. All of this animosity, which **will** emerge from the economic conditions and the already rampant racism on both sides, will unravel the country and destroy lives.

Another thing i'm not mentioning- this won't jibe with the basic concept most Israelis have about Israel. The feeling is that we want a country **of our own**, we want to live in a Jewish state, not happen to be a bunch of Jews living in a Palestinian state.

If I were you, I would've started KINOing her, flirting, escalating and see how she responds, you didn't even fucking try with her. Be you, do you and if she wants to tag along then cool, if not then cool.

katiebug0313,AskReddit,1390756352.0,"*sigh* Since you asked...

Animals should not be used as commodities. The massive overproduction of these poor defenseless creatures in these factory farms is wrong. How would you like it if you were born JUST to be murdered for someone else's enjoyment? Some of the things I've watched and read about what goes on behind closed doors is completely disturbing and shocking, to say the least.

Baby chicks that are shipped in to be used for egg production go on a conveyor belt for someone to check the gender real quick. Girls get thrown aside for obvious reasons, and little boy chicks are thrown in a grinder while still breathing and chirping. 

Cows are artificially inseminated to give birth to more cows for the process, and also so they can start to produce milk. The cows that are born are used for different things. Boys are either sold as babies for veal, or grown to be used for meat. Females are raised to be milk cows, and then when they're a ripe old age of four years old (cows in nature live much longer), and can't take the stress of having their udders hooked to machines to pump their milk out 24 hours a day, they are sold for hamburger meat. 

Of course, I know that there is a HUGE debate of whether or not humans need to consume animal products to survive, but the way we are going about it is just WRONG. Another thing that makes me angry is these so called ""free range"" and ""farm grown"" food companies are usually just as bad. There is no way a company can treat animals ethically and survive in this industry, battling against factory farming. And let's be real here... There is no way to ethically murder someone. Even if you put a bullet in their head. Watch videos of these animals being killed, and you tell me they didn't feel fear or pain. 

One more thing before I go on all day: Is a holocaust the mass murder of *human* beings? Or is it a mass murder of *innocent* beings? "

OPWC,AskMen,1390756399.0,"&gt; What do you value in a person's demeanor?

Calm, rational, hard-working, and honest.

&gt; How much does the person's style of dress influence your opinion of them?

Tricky to answer. I think people dress to reflect how they want to be seen. If someone dresses in a way that I see as disrespectful to themselves (clothes in poor condition or deliberately damaged, unkempt hair, pierced or tattooed in poor style or taste), then that definitely influences my opinion. If someone's appearance is a honest reflection of who they are, and that appearance appeals to me, then the exact ""style"" of it doesn't mater to me.

&gt; Would you rather a person to tell you they can't do a particular task outright, or instead at least try with probable faliure?

""I've never done that before, so I might need to ask for help."" 

&gt; How do I hold a conversation with you?

Be respectful and honest.

&gt; Is there anything that makes you lose respect or get annoyed instantly?

Be disrespectful and/or dismissive. You get one chance to make up for it, after that, I won't waste my time with you.

&gt; What actions can I take to gain your respect as an equal?

See ""What do you value in a person's demeanor?""

&gt; Would you/have you ever consider a teenage girl as your equal?

Yeah, I met my wife when we were in our teens. We were equals then, and in many ways still are (she's better some things, I'm better at others).

In my adult life, I can't think of any teenager who I regard as an equal, gender non-withstanding. I'm sure there are exceptions, but they haven't lived enough, learned enough, or worked enough to truly be a peer.

I've be working hard to master things for over 20 years (longer than a teen has been alive). I would recognize it if the kid had put in the effort at something, and that very rarely happens until someone's in their 20s."

Ostrololo,magicTCG,1390756513.0,"Before *Mirrodin*, ""Human"" wasn't a supported creature type. So if they printed a soldier who was a goblin, it was ""Goblin Soldier"", but a human soldier was just ""Soldier."" This was an extremely inconsistent and weird rule that had been grandfathered in *Alpha*.

Starting with *Mirrodin*, however, they wanted to tap into people's familiarity with RPGs and enforced a ""race and class"" guideline. At this point, the ""no human"" rule had to go. And they also issued errata for **all** previous humans giving them that subtype, including Shu Elite Infantry here.

Lurker117,keto,1390756551.0,"I cheat the first Sunday of every month.  I have a full-on carb explosion lol.  Basically whenever I have a huge craving for something during the month, I make a little reminder for myself to eat that on cheat day, and it helps get me through the craving.  Then when cheat day comes, I have a pretty good idea of what I'm going to eat.  Usually it's something like Taco Bell or Chinese food, something like that.  I don't pay attention to carbs or calories that day, but I do make sure to not over-do it and keep my portions somewhat normal.  I've gone back and estimated the calories a couple times after the cheat day for that month.  Usually it's in the 3,000 cal range.  

I actually take it a little easier these days, because having a day like that after strict keto for a month actually makes you feel like shit for a day or two after.  I've realized that it's not really worth it, and have been doing my cheats more like you, increasing calories for the day but keeping the carbs relatively low.  I still sneak in a reese's cup or two on cheat day though.  But once a month is do-able."

Most of the logging and other industry is going on outside the city, so all the revenue for the municipality comes from the retail and residential population.

They have their own Hydro company, a municipal police and fire department as well as having a fairly large RCMP detachment serving the surrounding area.

There are also a lot of influences coming from the Slocan Valley, which has long been a bit of a haven for the outskirts of society.  Their economy runs on the drug trade when you cut to the bottom of it, as long as you're okay with that, and you educate your kids along lines to prepare them to be able to deal with it, there shouldn't be too many issues.

It's really not. Obviously I have to submit that not being taken seriously on occasion is certainly a disadvantage, the benefits radically outweigh the cons, and that is something that has been concluded scientifically. 

It also has to be noted that going from unattractive to attractive has very different social and mental repercussions for the individual than someone who's always been good looking. I've known many people that began unattractive and got significantly more attractive and they typically only turn out two different ways: either they join the ""beautiful people"" club they were previously socially bannd from and become just as douchey, or they stay exactly the same and have problems being out of place because their SMV is incongruent with their perception of themselves, life, and other people.

And maybe this makes me sound like a jackass, but sometimes I go on/r/MUA and I see people overcompensating with the upvotes if the poster is either a male or a woman who is not conventionally beautiful, and they get a lot of upvotes for subpar makeup skills or even photo quality. I understand the encouragement, and I support encouraging all levels of skill, but I can't help but feel like they are being upvoted solely out of pity or something. It's annoying to me to see conventionally pretty girls on the frontpage who have very mediocre skills, and it's also annoying when I see somebody who was obviously upvoted because they are not conventionally beautiful and their makeup is not great. Maybe I'm being overly picky and critical. I just wish we'd upvote based on the makeup, not the person wearing it."

I remember one time when I had a falling out with one of the few girls I found attractive a friend from one of my classes gave the advice that if I ever wanted to ""get with girls"" that I needed to ask to just ask more girls out (he said until I was blue in the face) and lower my standards.  The concept seemed so alien to me and still does.  That girl was the first I'd been seriously attracted to both physically and (more importantly) mentally in an incredibly long time.  The idea that you could find so many people attractive just seems so foreign to me, I was taken aback when my friend gave me that advice.  I just can't fathom how guys can be attracted to so many different people at once!

Right now I'm going out with my best friend.  haha it took me five months of knowing her as a friend before I started to have a crush on her and even longer before I thought she was more than ""just above average."""

Jawthumb,dogecoinbeg,1390757004.0,"""Awoooooooooooo"" the wolf howled at the moon. Young Johnny Shibe heard these cries every night from the woods behind his house, and he yearned to be among them, but more than that he yearned to feel this ""moon"" they howled at so passionately, stretching their noses to the night sky, black with the exception of the piercing white object.

Johnny Shibe studied hard his whole life, played all the shibe sports, and kept his mind focused on his goal of getting to the moon. He graduated from high shibe, then took 23 credits a semester at shibe college to get his degree as fast as possible, so voracious was his desire to be connected with this beautiful object, his true love, his muse, none other could even compare to his sweet, sweet moon. He looked at all the best graduate shibes, and applied only to one, the one closest to SHIBESA, the only place he could possibly go to get to his precious moon.

He opened his mailbox a month later to find two letters, and hurriedly tore one open. ""You have been accepted to the graduate program in howling at SHIB University, #1 in howling studies. Please come to orientation tomorrow with payment for your first term."" Johnny Shibe was overcome with joy, and unable to do anything but chase his tail for hours out of excitement. Once he was too tired to continue his revelry, he hurriedly packed his bags and prepared for the trip to SHIB-U the next day.

His apartment empty and his plane ticket bought, he was panting the whole way there. Other shibes on the plane didn't understand his excitement just for the travel itself, but Johnny Shibe considered flight one step closer to the moon, and he loved it. At touchdown, however, he was still first off the plane, rushing to a taxi to get to orientation. In his haste, he had forgotten to zip his dogepack up, and the second envelope fell out. ""Shibe, I believe this is yours."" said another doge who had noticed. Johnny thanked the man, and noticed that the envelope was from his local shibit union. He opened it, and his heart fell. No more howling for Johnny, no more graduate shibe, no more moon. His account had been closed, and he lacked the funds to pay for his semester. Stranded, he checked into a hotel for the night, using the last of his available dogecoin in his wallet.

Too poor to eat, too sad to watch the newscast about the new class at SHIB-U, Johnny slowly meandered down to the pool, figuring that he could at least pretend he was on the moon underwater. When he got down and smelled the chlorine, however, he was reminded of how far he was and always would be from his sweet. Destitute, he was destined for homelessness, trapped in this new town without a single doge to his name. He had no heart for swimming, and laid down morosely in a pool chair. 

""Do you mind if I sit here?"" Johnny heard another doge say of the chair next to him. A halfhearted woof of acknowledgement was all that Johnny could get past his tongue. ""Why so down?"" asked the other shibe. Johnny wondered whether he should talk to the unknown doge, or continue to wallow in sadness. The doge seemed genuinely interested, so Johnny decided he would talk. ""I've been training my whole life to be a dogestronaut, to get to the moon. I've worked hard and I've studied hard, I graduated #1 in every class I've ever been able to graduate from, and I got all the way here to SHIB-U when I was informed that I had no money remaining in my account. My dreams which I had come so close to are dead."" Johnny had been sad before, but saying it all out loud made it feel much more final. He became even more sad, and the other doge noticed. ""Don't be so sad,"" the doge said, ""the moon is always there, you can always howl at it, and who knows, maybe your luck will turn around."" Giving Johnny a few dogecoins and telling him to buy dinner with it, the strange doge left.

The next day, Johnny was watching the news at breakfast when he saw something he couldn't believe. The doge from last night was on TV being interviewed at an odd looking spaceport! He abandoned the idea of eating and focused all his attention on the interview. ""Mr. Dogeson, what are you going to do about the lack of young dogestronauts willing to try out private moonflight?"" ""Well, actually, I think I've found the perfect candidate right here, and I will hopefully be launching a moonflight within the day."" everybody watching, both in the hotel's breakfast room and at the spaceport for the interview audibly gasped. Moonflight hadn't been attempted in 13 years, so nobody even remembered it. The doge on TV said one last thing before the interview ended; ""Johnny Shibe, if you're out there watching this, come and take your place on the moon."" The TV cut back to the newsroom, but dropping everything, Johnny was running to the nearest taxi before you could say ""wow"". ""That was Richard Dogeson from Virgin Space being interviewed, interesting stuff right there."" said the anchor.

Johnny Shibe arrived at the Virgin Space Spaceport with a renewed sense of purpose. Wasting no time, Richard Dogeson told Johnny to put on his equipment, because he was going to the moon. Johnny was the happiest he had ever been, but with his newfound goal, he summed up the strength to ignore the urge to chase his tail. He climbed into the ship, and Richard Dogeson looked at him with a sense of pride. ""10... 9... 8..."" the numbers faded out of Johnny's hearing as he thought back to all those who supported him in his lifelong journey to fulfill the dreams of his ancestors and get to the moon. Before he knew it, there was an immense pressure on him, followed by a joyful weightlessness.

The team at Virgin Space communicated with him, and he landed safely on the moon. Feeling connected to all those who had helped him get there, he donned his helmet and opened the hatch to the outside. Stepping down the ramp, he felt his fur stand on end when his paw hit the pure, grey surface, planting a permanent print. Taking a few more steps, he looked up.

""Awoooooooooooo"" the shibe howled at the earth."

Also, since you've identified that you compliment her more than she does to you, then you've probably concluded that you should compliment her less. So what do you think will be the result if you compliment her lesser than what you're doing right now?"

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390757094.0,"I don't exactly believe that a title of ""brave"" should be handed to anyone diagnosed with cancer, but here are some things you are not considering.

I don't know how many people are like this, but for me, when I started experiencing very serious, scary medical symptoms *(not cancer, but blood where there isn't supposed to be blood and tons of pain)* I was TERRIFIED to actually go to a doctor about it. For years the symptoms had crept up on me, slowly worsening. Deciding to make an appointment, keeping the appointment and saying out loud to a doctor what had been happening meant I had to acknowledge that there was a real problem that I had been ignoring, and then FIND OUT what it was.  It was psychologically a lot easier to ignore that there was a problem. In fact, I wasn't brave enough to go to the doctor. One day, in a particularly weakened state, I was hoodwinked by my family and taken to the hospital.

When it comes to surgery, anyone that goes through with a surgery has to have some level of bravery to do it.

If feels insane, before you consent to the drugs they give you, you look at these people that are going to shut down some *really* important parts of your body, control them for you, and then CUT YOU THE FUCK OPEN. My body panics, in that situation. My body is **very** certain that that is never supposed to happen. It is really hard to overcome that very physical response and sign the paper that says ""I know these people mean well but could kill me anyway in at least these dozen different ways"" instead of knocking the drugs out of their hands and making a break for it.   

As far as *(EDIT: nonsurgical)* cancer treatment goes (speaking after watching a handful of loved ones go through it), it is exhausting and depleting in a way that is truly horrifying to watch.

Basically its a game of chicken. ""I'm going to just start killing things, and I bet we finish killing you before we finish killing me."" Which has at least an element of bravery to it.

Also, you don't do it in one sitting. You have to keep going back.

And it doesn't feel good. It *feels* like it's killing you.

And with each treatment, as you feel that you *will* die if you keep this up, you wonder if you will win the game of chicken.

Continuing that process takes at least bravado or stubbornness, if not bravery.

Because there is no guarantee you'll win. And if you lose, you just spent your last time of earth feeling like shit, getting sicker and sicker.  Not crossing things off your bucket list. Not spending as much time with your loved ones, because you're so tired you spend most of your time resting, sleeping, vomiting.

Treatment is a gamble. You'll mostly likely die very quickly if you don't do it.

But you're making the choice to spend months feeling like you have the flu, when those months could be your last."

lordoffire,photography,1390757157.0,"Disadvantage (which made me a strong adherent of selecting focus points): Center-Point Focus and recompose doesn't work too well with lens/aperture combinations that produce a very shallow depth of field. (Long ago), after a few days of wondering why my portraits weren't razor-sharp, I narrowed down the problem to myself relying of center-focus and recompose. I switched to focus by point selection, and never looked back since. Yes, it takes more time to compose and focus, but the upside is that since it makes you concentrate more on composition, you generally result in more pleasing images (that has been my personal experience)."

FWIW, national news has been a bit lukewarm about a KC bid, but at the same time, Las Vegas is putting in the time/money to be the frontrunner, even though the city's, you know, image, will likely prevent the convention from being there. With that, I'm a little bit optimistic for KC- we can coast in the shadow of LV for a while, and later maybe move from second to first."

This is nothing new though. Ever read about the 50s and 60s?  There was government surveillance everywhere. And yes, sometimes it is turned on people dissatisfied with the political system. I read the other day the FBI used to monitor MLK, for instance. 

So I wouldn't say that the programs were made with the specific intention of spying on citizens, but I will say that they were made to be on the lookout for terrorism. That's not to say they can't be used against political dissidents though, and I kind of have a healthy fear of this to a degree.

You mention that you scare people, but it's probably not the idea that you'll hurt them physically (maybe, I dunno). It could be that you've got vibe going on where people can't figure out how to relate to you, so they stay away out of uncertainty more than fear.

If you feel like you're being treated in a more masculine social role, embrace it and see what happens. Just hang out with guys, learn how they do their thing.

Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1390757463.0,"Hey there, I just realized that I forgot to reply to you on the above comment, for which I apologize.  My life has been hectic lately and my brain is a bit scattered.  I warn you in advance, many of the links I share in this should probably be considered NSFW or possibly NSFL depending upon your perception.

I've found flash to be a rich medium for up-and-coming artists who have something to say, because it's way more accessible than much of the standard studio tools and some studios have adopted it as part of their standard dossier of mediums.  I particularly recommend [The Secret of the Kells](http://www.coldhardflash.com/2009/01/the-secret-is-out-on-kells-feature.html) (SFW, SFL) with the full movie viewable [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmfgnK5QmlE), having discovered it via /r/fullmoviesonyoutube .  It isn't exclusively done in Flash but it relies heavily on it and I love the textures, colors and rich story-telling which involves many elements of actual history and fuses it with some cool fantasy/folklore stuff.

I also enjoy [the work of David Firth](http://www.fat-pie.com/) who produces lots of creepypasta-type stuff which can be pretty jarring if you aren't used to it.  He is probably best known for his [Salad Fingers](http://www.fat-pie.com/salad.htm) series.  He's also a generally interesting and odd person to watch as he is a really quirky, dark, artist-type who works with lots of different media, all with an undeniably wry and dark twist to it, some of it more [heavy-handed and twisted](http://www.fat-pie.com/sock3.htm) than others.  He also has an alterego on his website called ""Devvo"" who produces some rather funny and twisted videos and music which is intended to pick on chav culture.  Some of his stuff is just produced to be [mindless &amp; silly](http://www.fat-pie.com/notstanley4.htm), shocking, and a probable outlet for whatever monsters he has in his head and much of the rest of it [has an actual social point to make](http://www.fat-pie.com/bigcelebrityfamezeppelin.htm)... see also [this](http://www.fat-pie.com/thechildthatsmeltfunny.htm).  Sociologically, I find him an interesting study and have been following his work since he first began.  If you are the sort who likes to track artistic progress, start with samplings from his earliest and far less skilled work [here](http://www.fat-pie.com/flash3.html) and work your way back to his latest stuff.  Fair warning: his oldest stuff is really bad but you can see the seeds of a mind ready to be honed in it's chosen art form.  He went on to do some [higher-profile work](http://www.fat-pie.com/musicguess.htm) for BBC/Charlie Brooker (whose stereotypically British wit and perspective I also love).

Finally, it gets lots of shit as a dumb program which far too many adults like, but I'll just say it: [My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony) which is animated almost exclusively in Flash as I recall.  While the series itself is a bit saccharine and silly, it was obviously made with a lot of love and thought on the animators/writer's part and I also find it sociologically interesting in that it completely took a dead and mindless genre/theme which had pretty much been buried and revived it with some decent moral lessons for kids as well as very unlikely fandoms which latched onto it.  I've hooked up several friends with kids of varying ages with it and, strangely, both teenagers and young ones all seem to love it, and the parents generally want to kill me after their kids are hooked, haha.

 Bottom line, if you don't think you should be responsible for your sexual decisions, man or woman, then you shouldn't be having sex. Whether you like it or not sex does come with risks. I will be the first person to admit those risks are *totally* worth it, but your argument is pretty moot when I offered two (in reality there are many more) other options to abstinence since I'm a realistic person and I know sometimes you just gotta get down and dirty.

Even when companies are led by people who think they can make a positive impact, they don't last long: they are voted out by their board or the company gets sued by its own shareholders for failing to realize as much profit as would have been possible.

Companies may start with this kind of forward thinking attitude, but they will lose it as soon as they become big enough to make a difference. See Google.

Unless individuals take on the responsibility of participating in corporate decision making by purchasing stock and make their values count, and/or take the responsibility of participating in politics and government and use that to impose restraint and reason in the form of facts-based policy and regulation, the future is bleak."

My cousin who is planning his wedding and living in a verryyy expensive city (and not earning much) was the first to donate vs. family member who constantly is redecorating/having spa nights donated nothing. 

My plan of attack is the following: send out Facebook messages to small groups. Through FB, you can see who read the message. You might get one bite per group. Don't do a giant group - do a select group; ie I did a group of girls I worked with separately from a group I lived with. That way, it was more personalized. Again monthly, I put up a message on my Facebook saying ""riding for cancer research, any donation counts."" 

Try seeing if a local bar has a happy hour you can team up with. One of my friends teamed up with a bar that would donate all the nights tips to her charity because she was essentially drumming up more business than usual.

As far as the initial soak, the premise is that an initial soak reduces the amount of loose dye, and therefore prevents dye transfer (ie you staining chairs/shirts/underwear/boots the first week or two of owning your jeans), and makes the jeans a tad softer by removing some of the starch in the denim. This affects the fading a bit, because the starch helps the denim sit in crispy folds, and the dye is 'fixed' to the denim during the initial soak. So theoretically the pro/con list is:

Soak: Softer, less staining/affects fading:longer to get high contrast fades

No Soak: Crispier fades, quicker fades/stiffer denim, a tad more uncomfortable during break-in(which is pretty short for light denims &lt;16oz)

I hope that helps, it's totally your call, they're your jeans and that's the whole point of raws. Best luck, and head over to /r/rawdenim if you haven't already! We'd be stoked to hear your opinions on your new pair, and many other owners of N&amp;F with more experience can answer your hypotheticals with more detail than I can (I own 3sixteens!)

&gt;So long as society encourages women of all ages to be the inherently promiscuous creatures they are and allow them to limit their sexual choices to the men at the top of the pyramid (when many of them have no right to), sexually frustrated men will continue to lash out with extreme violence.The Columbineâs will continue. The Sandy Hookâs will continue. The Arapahoeâs will continue. Until society sits down and thinks over these problems with an unclouded mind, men will continue the shootings. More people will die just so Jane Doe can continue to âexploreâ her sexuality.

However it appears likely that to describe a person would require much more than this, with the additional input being from the proteome (shared with other humans) and sensory experience. Memes seem a plausible way of describing some of this sensory experience, but I would put them at a higher (and fuzzier) layer of abstraction than genes. A gene can be very low level - for instance there about five genes involved in albinism - and hence I don't see them as a plausible unit of evolution."

I have it pretty good, I work around 40-45 hours a week almost every week.  I also have some coworkers that do like 6 hours in the office and then put in more time after they put their kids to sleep.  There's an understanding that there will be occasional crunch time with long weeks, but our manager has been very clear that if you find yourself regularly needing to work late at night or put in a lot of work on the weekend, something is wrong and we need to fix it.

That being said, I've heard that some teams have awful hours, especially on the retail side(I'm on the AWS side, which seems to be much more reasonable).

Also, even on teams that do have a poor balance, it's not like there's a requirement that you're working for X hours per week.  It's just that resources have been poorly allocated and a team doesn't have enough devs.

If you look at the data, winters have always fluctuated.  I figure it's supposed to be cold in winter and I've seen much colder elsewhere (e.g., Canada, Colorado).  As to your question, I always feel that February is the bigger snow month, so we'll wait and see if this is a bad one or not.  A couple years ago it was about two feet deep so we'll see."

The fear of *knowing* what was causing these things was enough to make me okay with just continuing to experience them.

Do think about this a little bit more, especially about going back for treatment after treatment.

For some, it might not be bravery, it might be just that they fear completed death more than hovering, waiting death.

But it does take actual effort, and increasing effort with each treatment, to get out of bed, get in the car, sit in the waiting room, let them hook up the kill-drugs, and then get back home again.

It could be that ""brave"" is the wrong word.

azayii,52book,1390758414.0,"This week I read:

* **The Explorer** by James Smythe. ([Review](http://www.robotwitch.com/?p=101)) A lost-in-space, odd ball of a book. It was real dark and creepy - and I loved it! The main character, Cormac, seemed authentic and sympathetic. Highly recommended.
* **The Echo** by James Smythe. The sequel to the above, I finished it yesterday. Didn't think I'd like it as much, but it just as sad, if not more tragic because you know, from the first book, so much more than Mira, the MC. Second book in the Anomaly Quartet. Going to have to read more by Smythe.
* **Speculative Fiction 2012** ed. Justin Landon and Jared Shurin. Eh, mixed bag. I thought some of these were awful - like Shurin's attempt at humour in one of his reviews they'd decided to include. But things like Kameron Hurley's essay etc. were pretty quality. Interesting stuff, anyway, and a wide array of different issues within genre were covered.

I'm currently listening to **Alice's Adventures in Wonderland**, which I hope to finish this week. I'm not so keen on the narrator, but ah well. I'm also reading **Snowblind** by Christopher Golden, a horror story that came out earlier this month. Starting out ominous, but only 15% of the way through, so who knows how that'll go!

I'm slowly getting through **What Makes This Book So Great?** by Jo Walton, and have decided I must read some of her books after this. She's an interesting lady. Later in the week, I hope to get to *The Best of All Possible Worlds* by Karen Lord, and...something else, I'm not sure what yet. A bit flippy-floppy this month.

On a side note, I only read 6 books in 2010, which I've already surpassed in one month!, and while the other years have been around the 20 book mark, this is a huge improvement on my usual reading. So thank you, 52books! It's a real motivation."

The_British_One,soccer,1390758633.0,"Ok, at least you've given it some thought and discussion! I don't mind that, just the people who click the downvote button because I'm bashing Man U or whatever.

1. In my opinion Sterling is *currently* the best winger for England. I'll put the names of players I've considered against him to just contextualise a bit: Young, Walcott, Milner, Townsend, Lallana, Zaha, Welbeck. Young hasn't been good this season. Walcott is injured. Milner I have never rated and I don't understand why Woy insists on playing him, Townsend had a good few games around the international break but has since been uninspiring, Llana is probably the closes to Sterling, but has little experience in a quality side, Zaha has been overrated by many people and being loaned out says a lot, and Welbeck is atrocious.

2. I've never liked Terry. Perhaps it's not the way he plays, just the things he does. But I think Cahill &amp; Luiz are far better in defence for Chelsea, and someone like Jagielka should be in the England team over him. He's not a bad player, I just don't think he's great either.

3. Johnson has had a bad season and I will hold my hands up and admit that. But I think he's underrated (and to be honest you're sort of proving my point). The last few seasons he has been great. He's better attacking than defending, yes, but that's how he plays. The goals he scored and chances he's created far exceed any mistakes he's made defending. 

3. I meant Suarez is targeted to a greater extent than any player in the premiership. If you saw the match against Hull, for example, he was kicked in the chest, and made to bleed, yet no free kick was given. There was physical evidence of the violence towards him and nothing was done. I understand his reputation, but I think people should also recognise he's recently cleaned up his act a lot. He hasn't dived at all this season (unless you count Villa, which I don't think was a dive). Furthermore, I don't think refs should be judging a player on reputation. I know that's incredibly easy to say and much harder in practice, but if they see a player clearly fouled, they should not not give the free kick because he has a reputation for diving. "

Bottom line is **YOU** are responsible for your sexual health and if you don't feel you should be responsible for that then you probably should just refrain from having sex until you can handle that kind of responsibility. 

Sexual health is something that should be discussed between both  partners in the case of a relationship and they should come up with something they are equally comfortable and safe doing. Not having a baby is on both parties, but if you can't trust the woman you are having sex with then you need to be a goddamn adult and either not have sex with her or use protection if you aren't ready for a kid.

My point is, you have 100% control over your semen. It has to get to a very specific place to get that woman pregnant. If you can't keep your semen out of that place if you don't want a child then yes, you have already made your decision, and will have to live with the consequences accordingly.

Abortion is something that *should* be discussed with both parties if either partner wants one, but like I said, there is a very specific chain of events that leads to a pregnancy, so if you're going to be having sex, be as safe as possible about it."

Sublyminality,AskWomen,1390759033.0,"I've never shared this with anyone, but here's my story.

I was in a relationship for 4 years with a guy who really was horribly to me mentally and emotionally, and it took me until the last month to finally realize it because I was always too afraid to talk about it. We were long distance for all 4 years, and because of how he treated me, I'm afraid of the possibility of my current SO having to move even just an hour away for work.

At first, he was amazing. Super sweet, very funny, always complimenting me. What time I had that wasn't spent at school was spent IMing him on the computer. After a couple of months, I made a couple new friends in classes that I really wanted to get closer to, and so I slowly started spending less and less time on the computer. He was okay with this for awhile, being supportive and encouraging. But then, things changed. He started getting upset with me that I decided to spend Friday night with my need girlfriends instead of being couped up in my room on my computer chatting with him. He said it was ruining our relationship, and subsequently ruining his life, and it was entirely my fault. Shortly after arguing with him, I got unlimited texting, and he required that I text him whenever I wasn't on my computer, so I did. I didn't want to upset him, cause his reaction upset me.

This continues on for a year, and then I move to a different state. At the time, I was thinking about doing engineering, so I enrolled in a community college. Most of the people in my classes are guys, and I quickly made friends with them to form a study group. This really made my ex jealous, and he got angry at me. He immediately accused me of cheating and insulted me by calling me names like whore and slut. Every day he would say degrading things to me, and all I could bring myself to do was apologize about it. If I even tried to refute any of it, it would get even worse. Eventually I quit telling him about the guys, just lied that I did stuff alone. That made me feel bad, lying to him, but not as bad as him yelling at me. 

Another year and a half goes by, and I transfer to the local university. I move into a dorm and whatnot, and he's acting happy for me, mostly because I'm in an all girls dorm. Well, at the university, there's only 5 girls in my classes. So, again, I make a lot of guy friends. I forget to lie and he gets angry again, and forbade me to get any closer to them. 

At this point, our relationship is on the rocks, and he starts arguments over anything and everything, and its all my fault. Every night I would fall asleep crying because of things he would say to me. After a couple months of this, I finally say I want to break it off, that I can't do this anymore. Instantly he threatens to kill himself, and his blood would be on my hands. Of course I can't let that happen so I stayed. Our relationship continues to be just arguments, and we get into a cycle of fight, talk about breaking up, he threatens suicide, we stay. 

Finally, a year and a half ago, I meet a guy who's nice to me, respectful, a real gentleman. I developed a crush on him, and it makes me realize that I don't really love my ex. I hate what he was doing to me, and I couldn't imagine how he could actually treat someone he loves like that. I confront my ex on how I can't take it anymore, he threatens suicide again, but this time, I had the courage to tell him how unfair that was, and after calming him down, he finally agreed to end it.

It took me 5 months to work up the courage to be more thanks friends with my crush, and now he's my SO for a year in March. He's the second best man I've ever met in my life (first would be my Dad). He treats me with the respect and care and love that I deserve, and understands that the vast majority of my friends are guys. He trusts me completely, and I've been learning to reciprocate that to him. I still can't bring myself to share my past experience, because I don't want his sympathy. I just want exactly what he gives me now--his love."

You can't use him unless you compare it to the highest paid film actors in history also (which is anywhere from salaries of $30-45m to total earnings of $70-150m, for surely comparable time/effort to a full season of his which is around $18-19m), but neither really mean much. I'd love to see a more average pay comparison of TV and movies (exclusive to the stars who work in both arenas, and another one all encompassing), for no other reason than I'm just genuinely curious.

I like Machado and think he will be a really solid player but I have a hard time to justify reaching on him especially since there are lots of people who are very high on him. He is an elite defender which adds to his actual baseball profile but fantasy wise does him no good. If the Manny Machado that showed up for the first half of the season were to be the real deal and sustainable I 100% reach on him. However, he came down to earth big time. He had 39 doubles before the All Star break but only 12 post all star break. His average also dropped .70 points. Now he is not a .240 hitter don't get me wrong but he's also not going to hit .310.  He will hit .270-.280 knock in around 75 runs and score maybe 90 runs. Plus he does not walk much at all which hurts him. I would really like to see some steps forward in regards to plate disciple for him Manny is a solid player but he will always be a better baseball player than a fantasy baseball player."

runningsalami,funny,1390759190.0,"It's from an adaptation:
&gt; In Giambattista Basile's version of Sleeping Beauty, the sleeping beauty was named Talia. When checking out her horoscope, her father had found out that Talia would be in danger from a splinter of flax. This splinter was the cause of Talia's long deep sleep. Unlike the version most of us know from Sleeping Beauty, Basile's version consisted of a more gruesome plot. After Talia (sleeping beauty) died/fell into the deep sleep, she was seated on a velvet throne and her father, to forget his misery of her death, closed the doors and abandoned the house forever. One day, while a king was walking by, one of his falcons flew into the house. The king knocked hoping to be let in by someone but since no one answered, he decided to climb up the ladder he had brought with him and go inside the house. There he saw Talia. He called on her but she was unconscious. Instead of finding out what's wrong or even being worried about this, he carried her to bed and raped her while she was unconscious. Then he just left her in the bed and went back to his kingdom. Even though Talia was unconscious, she gave birth to twins. One of whom kept sucking her fingers. Talia woke up because the twin had sucked out the flax that was stuck deep in Talia's finger. When she had woken up, she saw that she was a mother. She did not know what had happened to her. One day, the king had decided he wanted to go see Talia again and went back to the palace to find her awake and a mother to his twins. He caught her up to who he was, what had happened, and they ended up bonding. After a few days, the king promised her that he will return to take her to his kingdom and went back to his realm. The King's wife kept hearing ""Talia, Sun and Moon"" coming out of her husband's mouth in his sleep so she bribed the king's secretary and also scared him to tell her what was going on. After the queen learned the truth, she pretended she was the King and wrote Talia asking her to send the twins because he wanted to see them. Talia sent her twins to the ""king"" and the queen told the cook to kill the twins and make dishes out of them. She had wanted to feed the king his children. The cook instead of doing what the queen had told him, took the twins to his wife and hid them. He then cooked two lambs and served it as it was the twins. Every time the king mentioned how good the food was, the queen replied ""Eat, eat, you are eating of your own"". Then queen later invited Talia to the kingdom and was going to burn her alive, but the king appeared and found out what was going on about his children and Talia. He then ordered that his wife be burned and not Talia. He also burned those who betrayed him. Since the cook actually did not obey the queen, the king thanked the cook for saving his children by giving him rewards. The story ends by the king marrying Talia and living happily ever after.

past_is_prologue,worldnews,1390759199.0,"Here is the thing, Canada isn't Indonesia.  Hospitals and schools won't be too expensive because they will be paid for through tax dollars.  No one is going to be turned away because they are too poor.  Look at mining in other places in Canada, aboriginal contractors and companies are making huge amounts of money.   Look at places like Ft. Macmurray.  People aren't being exploited with low wages, just the opposite.  People who are brought in from other countries to work (temporary foreign workers) make much less than Canadians.  The TFW are definitely being exploited, but that is another story.

By your logic mines are a waste of time because even though locals can work in them, and huge amounts of infrastructure is built, and large royalty payments go to the territorial government, they are going to leave some day, so they are bad.  A company or two is going to turn a profit, so they are bad.  Then you turn around and condemn mining on a tool made out of items mined out of the ground.  I guess it is okay when other people do it, right?  What a silly line of reasoning."

Being a female or minority would be a *huge* advantage, so if you are either or both, mention that.

There are only a couple of manufacturers that dominate the market

&gt;If true, then they'll have a great incentive to improve technology, which is a good thing.

No, again their goals are profits unless somebody sells something better at the same price(cost of technology and EU regulations make this impossible.) their sales numbers aren't affected, and they won't do shit.

&gt;There's nothing at all in your links about a limitation of 1l., just a limitation of CO2 exhaust. They can achieve that any way they want.

No, they can't because it's nominal, and not relative as in 130 g by year x and not year x will need to have the average dropped by 10 %. to hit that stupid average you nee to sell under powered vehicles.

but it's not the real ecological cost, smaller engines are less reliable because in every day use you force them more often, a car you bought in the 90s ran hundreds of thousands of kilometers, today even a vw will croack a couple of thousand km after it goes out of warranty.

&gt;Lifecycle analyses are heavily dependent on current production practices, and change along with them. For example, as we shift electricity production towards renewables their indirect CO2 emissions will also dwindle.

but we won't that is exactly the problem, we consume much more now than in the 00's and that is primarely busines, politiicans whipe themselfs clean by enforcing consumer markets but don't touch the big consumers.

&gt;You also can't lump together various pollution effects on a single scale.

Just pointing out how superficial these ecological fixes are.

&gt;long trips on a hilly highway

eruopean cities have hills, hiways don't(also modern economical cars because the run at higher rpm on highways are actually less economical than a standard diesel)

&gt;an electric vehicle is better suited in the first case

I agree but due to the high cost, a bicicle or public transport still makes more sense, coviniece and ecological reason in those cases.

&gt;But I'm sure that won't address your hill problem either :)

She knows exactly what she's doing and she will continue to do it over and over again.  It's NOT your job to be the adult in this situation.  If you really think she's bipolar then try to talk to her about it but don't expect it to go over well.  N's do not like being considered anything but 100% perfection.  

It's going to be hard until your sisters can get out of the house.  Try not to let nmom get to you and don't play her game of 'you're a bad son' if you can avoid it.  Keep your responses to a minimum of words and try not tor trigger her anger.  Easy to say but hard to do.

If you fail: you being violent hurts the cause for those of us who don't want to use violent means. A major reason the right wing has so much power is BECAUSE of those marxist countries and their bad results. And if our own citizens act violently, the general population will turn on them like that. Why do you think there was so much emphasis on OWS remainly nonviolent, for instance? Besides, nonviolent protests can work. They did the job for MLK for instance, and I see those previous attitudes he was fighting as much more resistant to change than our current ones.

Sorry for not being a marxist who believes in revolution when this path has had a 100% failure rate so far."

You need to worry a lot less about how much your forum buddies will miss you and a lot more about the fact that you've checked out of life.  There's two aspects to this: one is that your forum ""friends"" aren't, and can't, develop into actual friends because they dont' know you. And can't know you as long as you keep up this weird fantasy. At the same time, do you think they enjoy talking to you becuase the pic you showed them was of a sexy guy? No, it's because of you.  The real you. 

Now, I don't know how close these online 'friends' are. My guess, from personal experience with forums, is that pretty soon after you stop posting most of the people will start melting away. If there are people that do take the trouble to stay in touch and try to maintain a relationship, I think you have to bite the bullet and tell them. Really, your only choices are to disappear / sign off the forum completely, or decide who's important enough to you to trust with the truth. But the status quo is absolutely untenable and will just fuck you up worse and worse. 

Here's my suggestion. Tell your forum that you're taking 6 months off from social media (or whatever) to get healthy and develop better habits. Then, fucking do it. Get out of the house. Lose weight. Meet people. At the very least, message some guys in your area. You will never ever ever have a real life until you cede this fantasy, and I don't think it's possible to do it slowly. Pull the bandaid off. You can do it! It won't be fun at the very beginning, but nothing worthwhile is easy. And the difference between real friendships and what you have will make it all worthwhile.  Maybe a couple of your forum friends will become real friends, and maybe not. But you've got to live a life."

&gt; And, even in that sort of class, I would expect the attrition rate to be less than 50%. That has to be quite unusual, or we'd see the average time to graduation being a lot higher than it is.

You make it sound like a dire situation for a student to think they might like a subject and then find out that they don't.  If that were the case, then most college kids would be screwed, because typical freshmen either have no idea what they want to study or too many ideas, and virtually none of them have a taste of upper-level work in *any* subject.  Not to mention that the period from the beginning of freshman year to the end of sophomore year is about 10% of a student's life span up to that point.  But it's okay.  The system accommodates people changing and learning a bit; it would be insane if it didn't.  Among my classmates, it was normal to vacillate between two or three areas of interest for the first three or four semesters, and also pretty normal to graduate in four years.  The only way people got really screwed was when they decided at the end of sophomore year to switch to a major that they didn't have any credits in yet.

&gt;Incorrect. If you go to the bottom of the survey, the question that was asked to males was: ...

The question, while not irrelevant, is not relevant in this case because of the clearly stated definition of rape as stated on pg.17 of the report:
&gt;Rape
is defined as any completed or attempted unwanted vaginal (for women), oral, or anal
penetration through the use of physical force (such as being pinned or held down, or by the
use of violence) or threats to physically harm and includes times when the victim was drunk,
high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent. Rape is separated into three types,
completed forced penetration, attempted forced penetration, and completed alcohol or drug
facilitated penetration.

To be raped by their definition is to be penetrated, not to be made to penetrate.

My point about the prison was that a significant group was omitted in the survey. I then threw that aside because any difference that would have made would be purely speculation and had little to do with the question. It was just a side note.

&gt;Are you trying to apply the unreliable 12 month statistic to multiple years?

Who says it's unreliable? and why is that less reliable than the lifetime statistic? They are both from the same respondents. The question asked was if anyone had suffered mentioned form of violence at any point in their lives, and then if they had suffered it within the latest 12 months.

And yes I am comparing the recent year statistic to the lifetime statistic and finding the results pretty damn scary. I only hope that there are more studies like this being preformed so we can compare the yearly reports to each other and see in which way the trend is moving.

&gt;They're represented because that was the data the survey collected. If too few respondents participated, it was noted.

What are you even talking about? This is not what I asked about. You are misunderstanding the statement you cite. That statement is referring to *subgroups* of *men* reporting specific cases of violence. It also clearly states that when the figures are too small or a reliable estimate could not be calculated it would also be represented as such. Hence the asterisks in the tables. All figures represented are deemed reliable by those who made the report.

&gt;Your math is faulty, because it's assuming a small sample size that, as is mentioned in the study, is not representative 

Where is it mentioned that it's not representative? And if the sample size is not representative then why is the study even used at all? To quote your quote:
&gt;These tables are included in the report so that the reader can easily determine what was assessed and **where gaps remain**.

Where gaps remain is represented by the asterisks in the tables, this is done because a reliable estimate could not be made. With that they are saying that the numbers given can be considered reliable estimates.

&gt;So heres the problem with that. ...

Look, if you think this survey is unreliable you could have said so from the start and saved me a lot of time and effort. To be honest I would have loved to see an even bigger study about all this but for now I'll take what I can get. I see no admissions that the statistics are unreliable within the survey and frankly, if I did, I'd be very surprised.

&gt;But it is considered rape. It's in the question and it's included within the CDC's broader definition of rape.

The CDC has no official definition of rape, I checked their website, they have definitions of sexual violence though. But this study certainly does have a clear definition of rape which I provided to you (I believe I even put in the page-number) but here is another statement from the study (pg.84):
&gt;Being made to
penetrate is a form of sexual victim
-
ization distinct from rape that is
particularly unique to males and, to
our knowledge, has not been explic
-
itly measured in previous national
studies. It is possible that rape
questions in prior studies captured
the experience of being made to
penetrate someone else, resulting
in higher prevalence estimates for
male rape in those studies

How much more clear can you get? Rape is a term widely used, and this study is clearly defining rape as ""forced penetration"" and not ""being forced to penetrate"". This is my major beef with it and in regards to such a definition I couldn't care less about the numbers. Now however the numbers do show some interesting results so I actually do care about them but that is separate from the definition issue. And rape was never mentioned in the question asked, you can look up your own citation there, a simple ctrl+f will suffice.

I personally gain very little from minimizing or maximizing certain rates of sexual assault, which is why I don't do it. I merely look at the data provided and what it says. What I'm looking for firsthand is that being forced to penetrate should be recognized as rape especially if the word rape is to be used in official statements and surveys. Secondly, it wouldn't hurt to check out why so many men are recently being forced to penetrate.

I bid you good day."

You got me there with the efficiency though, I do not really know much about it; it is a kit beer and my first time with actual grains and the instructions/recipe make no mention about it. The grains are malted, but I guess all brewing grains are?

Halving the 6 gal instructions I should boil 3 gals of which 0.5 is expected to be evaporated and replaced at the end of the boil.

The process is simple: put the grain/malt in a bag at 150Â°F for about an hour then retrieve the bag and do a regular 60 minute boil with the 3 hop additions at 45/30/10 minutes."

Most of this revolves around billing which is extremely convoluted with many, many different plans, each with their own features and costs.

einTier,Austin,1390760164.0,"I've lived in a couple high rises downtown and been inside many of them.  I can't think of any downtown buildings that are publicly accessible in the manner you're speaking. 

All the apartment high rises are very anal about access.  Many of them have floors that won't open for anyone that doesn't live on that floor (with a few exceptions for staff).  Even if you live in them, you still won't have access to all floors.   Most of them have reserved the top floors for mega buck tenants.  Getting to the roof requires knowing the maintenance staff and even then, they'll be reluctant to take you because they don't want everyone asking. 

A Realtor can get you in to any units that are for sale, but good luck convincing one to take you for a high rise tour when you can't afford any of the properties in question or have no interest in buying. 

Business buildings are a little different.  If you can make it past the front desk, you can probably go to any of the common areas if you're dressed appropriately.  However, the rooftops and such aren't generally considered common areas.  You'll probably only see hallways, but you might get lucky and find a window or be able to see one through an open door. 

Your best bet is the Austonian, and it happens to be the tallest building downtown.  The top two floors, including outdoor space, is common area for all tenants.  This is exceedingly rare and exceedingly awesome. Any tenant can get you up there and you can spend as much time as they'll let you spend. 

Don't know anyone who lives there? Go in and talk to the staff. They're still selling units, so if you act and dress like you could buy, they'll show you around including the common areas on the top floors. "

Observations:

Sativa for pre lifting.  Do not get past a [5] or the work out will be either counterproductive or potentially dangerous.


Indica for post lifting.  Since this is a body high it will help with pain management.

Borrow a pencil. Be her friend and see how she reacts. (Talking to her will let you actually figure out if you *want* to go out with her, too.)

Quite honestly, I think you need to back up and do some work on you first. You know nothing about this girl at all. To think that walking up to her in a group and asking her out without knowing her name is even a possible course of action is kind of a red flag. That's just not how it works. I would suggest you do some reading on social cues and work on being friends with girls. And listen and learn. The fact that you're focused on getting her number without knowing anything about her shows to me that you don't have enough experience with women to pull this off. It's hard to say much more without knowing your background, but there were enough things in your post that were just... a little off, that makes me think you need more social experience and more non-romantic interaction with women before you jump to ""asking out a stranger."""

csreid,technology,1390760465.0,"&gt;I think the problem is that people expect to be multi millionaires simply for being talented.

Nah. I don't think it's unreasonable for a reasonably successful band to think they should be able to earn a living by doing nothing but music. Let's say a third of their income should come from ""music sales"". But let's pretend they don't sell albums and instead get all that income from streaming (since, for artists to not feel screwed, Spotify should pay up at least as much as the artists would have made selling albums). That means they should need around $17k a year from Spotify. A quick googling tells me that Spotify estimates each song will generate $0.0084 per stream on the high end. So, to make that $17k, they'd need to average around 39,000 streams per week. 

That's a lot. It might not be a lot to Avicii or Rihanna, but it's a lot to Unearth or Phone Calls from Home. 

And that's assuming all of the money goes directly to the artist to pay his rent, etc, and that none is used to, say, buy studio time. It's also assuming the artist is one single person. I also used the high estimate of per stream payout from Spotify.

Not every musician is the super successful millionaire. "

just talk it out and if things fall through, then that's how it was meant to be. they may be still cool to hang out with once in a while, but shit just gets awkward unless you both are 100% past it."
stinatown,AskReddit,1390760486.0,"It's crazy easy. 

The next time you have a  loaf of bread that goes stale, cut it into cubes. Then, melt a generous amount of butter in a frying pan over medium heat (like, a whole stick of butter for a medium sized loaf). Toss in the bread cubes and toss to coat. They'll soak up the butter really fast. Season with salt, pepper, and/or whatever dried herbs you like--I like Italian flavors--and toast them in the pan, tossing and stirring occasionally, until they get golden and crispy. I like to add grated Parmesan near the end. And you're done! I keep them in the fridge because I like snacking on them cold. "

clls,smalldickproblems,1390760571.0,"just like you need to learn how to be with a bigger guy without hurting yourself, how to deal with an (un)circumcised penis, you also need to learn how to be with a smaller guy. some positions work better than others (check out: http://www.nrk.no/livsstil/sex-positions---guide-for-better-se-1.6531915, go to 'him', and then click 'small penis'). like you said, it's not about his penissize, it's about learning how to please a different kind of penis (and please yourself with it).

Learn to understand his possible insecurities. take a look at this subreddit, maybe talk to some people on here and read about it (for example http://positivejuice.wordpress.com/2010/03/03/9-reasons-why-men-are-insecure-about-their-penis-size/). After that, try talking to him about it (because it obviously isn't the same for everyone). Does he even have these insecurities? don't assume! If he feels comfortable while he is naked, chances are that he isn't insecure about it. then please don't make him feel like he should be insecure. The post was mostly about your insecurities regarding his smaller penis. Keep in mind how your insecurities are viewed by him. Does he know that it's about YOUR insecurity to please him and how to deal with his smaller penis? his interpretation of the situation could be very different.

if he is insecure about it, it is important to realize that it isn't about you. yes, let him know how you view it, and of course it is very important to bring some positivity into the conversation. you are now a big contribution on how he views himself. be careful with it, but be honest and remember to stay positive (http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/16vl8c/a_fun_practical_tip_for_helping_your_lady_or_man/). maybe tell him about your insecurities to please him. ask him to teach you. have fun!

also, give him a blowjob, it's much more fun when a guy has a smaller penis. you'll feel like a goddess

Optimus has fucking rockets, energy cannons, giant guns over 50cal, energy swords/axes that would literally cut him in half like butter, energy hooks that he has used to rip MOTHERFUCKING GIANT ROBOTS IN HALF. Even if he doesnt know how to kill them specifically it doesnt matter. Sure you have to cut a specific spot in the manga but that is only because they dont have the advanced weaponry to literally BLOW THEM UP. And if you say blowing them up doesnt work you can go fuck yourself. Because that would totally work. Have you seen what a 50 cal bullet does to the side of an armored car? Now pump that shit up to like 150cal and you are getting close to optimus's max fire power. 

Optimus is made of like future metals and alloys that I doubt the Titan could even damage. The titan was able to be held down by about ten other titans. Lets go on the big side and say each titan weighs 3 tons. 3*10*2000=60000lbs or 30 tons. Optimus can lift upwards of 80 tons and weighs 40 tons himself. Im sorry but your delusional if you think a giant (granted a giant with a kickass healing factor and some armor) could even come close to competing. 

Also. Optimus is a fucking genius by human standards. The titans are just regular people at their base intellectual level. They arent smart enough and have never seen plasma energy cannons or giant glowing swords. All they can do is run at him. Optimus can just stand there and start shooting. Its literally super easy. And he is a robot. He doesnt miss when something is coming straight at him. And to top it off Optimus is the leader of a race of super advanced aliens that have been fighting GIANT FUCKING ROBOTS FROM SPACE for thousands of years. He has literally been threw thousands of battles throughout the galaxy and all of a sudden he gets taken down by this little bitch.  He has taken guys bigger than this titan before. No way. Im sorry.

* Level 46 Max skilled, max Awoken EotS Siren

* Level 44 Skill level 2 EoS Echidna

* Keeper of Rainbow

* Friend Level 86 +40 fully Awoken SoD Lucifer



**My Walkthrough:**

I did pretty much the same thing chaoism did (except I had an RK instead of a second gravity). Didn't use any Morning Star nukes on levels 2 and 3 just in case. After Aldebaran used Auto Recover, I used one. Unfortunately, by the time I killed him normally, I had a couple of turns left on that Lucifer's active. Had to use Defensive Stance when CDD attacked and I barely made the HP cutoff. Died once on Hera-Is when she bound all but my Echidna, which didn't even have her skill up yet. *Overall it took me about 90 minutes of effort to beat the dungeon.*

kakersdozen,AskReddit,1390760774.0,"It's not the situation alone. It's the feeling you get from the way someone treats you or looks at you. A funny, fleeting look from a bus driver, who then drives away, is not menacing. A car driving past is not menacing. An old guy quietly reading the newspaper next to you on the train is not menacing. An officer behaving properly is not menacing.

Her date asking her to go to a bar is not menacing the first time. Maybe a little bit inappropriate, and showing a lack of social awareness, but not threatening. Him repeatedly asking her to put herself into an unsafe situation with a stranger despite her many denials, *is* menacing.

Have you never been creeped out by someone? Felt totally uncomfortable and unsafe? Had a heightened state of awareness because you were unsure about the intentions of another person? Every woman has. If you can't comprehend how that adds a threatening factor to someone's behavior, then there is no hope of me ever explaining this to you."

i'm reminded of a teacher who told a story of why he's circumcised, his dad was in the military way back when, and the uncircumcised men were having LOTS of cases of infections/etc related to their foreskin out in combat conditions, so the military lined them up and cut them off. he said his dad won't ever forget that pain from being circumcised as an adult so he did it to his son when he was so young he wouldn't remember it. i've also heard about instances where the foreskin is so tight the guy cannot retract it to clean and it has to be cut for medical reasons. i've also read dozens of reddit threads about girls with uncut boyfriends who simply do not know how to clean their penis properly, excuse for circumcision? no, but a minor benifit. the std argument is still raging on so i won't even make a stance on that one

BuildMyPaperHeart,Warframe,1390760999.0,"It's not as much about Profit as it is about Effort.

Farming for resources, mods and blueprints is the crux of the Warframe experience, IMO. The whole point is to chase after some of the rarer stuff, with trading as a fallback for those who find it too difficult and need a helping hand. I'm cool with Mods being tradeable, but blueprints, well...

While I agree with Blueprint trading in terms of rarer ones, like Vauban or Banshee, permitting this across all Warframes might actually incentivize spending money, since you can get all three parts for (presumably) cheaper than buying it directly from Market. In addition, it takes away the chase and experience of fighting unique bosses and exploring the world. In short, you don't have to play the game all that much to get all the stuff you need: a good amount of credits run with friends will allow you to trade mods and other stuff for Plat, which you can then exchange for blueprints or other mods. It's playing Warframe for its miniature economy rather than its abundance of game mechanics and features.

I think it's interesting, personally, that a lot of design decisions are attributed solely to DE because 'DE makes the game' and 'DE can do it' and 'DE needs to make money.' But we should consider how we, the community and players, would react to certain design decisions, and whether it'd be worth it for ourselves. Might not always be the case. 

Just some thoughts."
CaliBuddz,whowouldwin,1390761000.0,"Ok... What. It is no limits. Enel is lightning. He is lightning. Do you understand those implications. That he is lightning itself. Thor is awesome and can probably shoot some energy wave blast that will fuck up luffy. But his lightning will no hurt him. 

Also why is it a fallacy? If it is true then its not a fallacy. Your just trying to use fancy fallacy talk to change the subject. I never said luffy would win. But if thor only used lightning luffy would win. Hence the reason he is made of rubber. He doesnt conduct electricity. Be it 10 million volts or 10 billion mjolinorillion volts. It doesnt matter because the lightning wont flow through him. 

Edit::
Also I looked it up 

""The no limits fallacy is the illogical idea that a poorly understood phenomenon can be extrapolated to infinity or assumed to not have any maximum value or threshold. For a gross example, observing that a shield can easily withstand an attack from a particular weapon, one might illogically conclude that the shield could withstand fire from an unlimited number of those weapons at the same time, or that it could withstand fire from a similar weapon that was much more powerful.""

I get it. But I still think it doesnt mean shit to luffy. He wasnt even phased by enels lightbing at all. Like in the slightest. Lightning is lightning and thor cant create super lightning. Unless he creates like plasma or something. In which case its different entirely 


Edit2: So I just read up on lightning and thors powers. It seems that at a certain threshold it is no longer conventional lightning and turns into a magic lightning bolt at his higher thresholds. So in this case magic is what would hurt luffy not the lightning. "

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1390761296.0,"&gt; For God's sake know what you are arguing for! When there is not a proposition of morality on an action or an attitude, there cannot be an **amoral act** or an amoral attitude,

It seems like you are the one who doesn't understand what you were arguing about.

What is an amoral act? You're the one who was trying to assert that amorality has to involve active disregard for morality. That was your personal understanding of it, but as you know now, this stricter definition of yours doesn't apply universally to others.

For your edification, yet another standard view of amorality:

http://atheism.about.com/library/glossary/general/bldef_amoral.htm

&gt; The term amoral is distinct from the terms moral and immoral, and simply refers to the state of lacking any moral characteristics. **An amoral act** is not morally good nor is it morally bad - it simply is.

Here is another:

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amoral

&gt; 1. a :  being neither moral nor immoral; specifically :  lying outside the sphere to which moral judgments apply

Even the wiki article I linked, which you tried to coopt without reading, made it clear that [whether there was a ""proposition of morality"" and an active disregard for it or not] is not mandatory to determine amorality in ""non-human manifestations"". Look through the examples. (""For example, a rock may be used (by rational agents) for good or bad purposes, but the rock itself is neither good nor bad."")

It does CHarged Down Slash-&gt;slap-&gt;Super Charge down slash. As well as horizontal slash and Up Slash.

The charge slashes do ALOT of damage and I feel good when ever I can connect a lvl 3 slash. Even more so with the Super Charged. 

Its Best at cutting tails(Up slash has a lot of vertical range). 

I like it because of the charges and the ability to block attacks. (one of the reason I switch from long swords).

Its main fault is its speed. The movement with it drawn is slow so you have to move by sheathing, which isn't too bad in it self but the swing speed is slow enough that you have to plan ahead when to active the attack so it connects when the monster is close. "

The missiles they show in their military parades are not known to be functional (the BM25 Musudan missiles shown in the military parades are thought to be models constructed of wood and sheet metal due to the fact that the missiles were never launch tested). Their space program is barely there, with one satellite in LEO after 5 launches over a period of 14 years.

A few minutes later, we heard our server (who was also apparently serving the teenagers) telling the hostess or another server or something that they'd left without paying. The three of us left the waitress a relatively large tip on our bill and an extra $20 with a note saying we'd overheard her and were sorry and hoped that this would help cover the table that had left.

He wasn't even comfortable with the thought of her just making out fully clothed and no other guys around, but then you add in her shirtless and another guy watching?

ARRO-gant,todayilearned,1390761621.0,"I have a few issues using common sense to decide on political ideas.

The first problem is that common sense is not all that common, so lots of people don't have it.

The second is that common sense is very often a way to pretend your bias or belief is rational, because it's very easy to say, ""it's just common sense that ____,"" and if anyone disagrees you've already positioned yourself on high ground as being rational but without actually providing a rational argument.

The third is that common sense is often just plain wrong.

For example in this case, it might be that three-strikes rules just have no real effect on crime. It might be that they do have an effect on crime. Ideally we should look at the numbers from states with 3-strikes and states without it, and see if the decrease in crime over the last twenty years was any different(really we want to see if the difference is statistically significant). In fact it's possible states with 3-strikes rules had less of a decrease in crime than states without, but we won't know unless someone actually does the comparison."

tank_the_frank,unitedkingdom,1390761649.0,"They're sports, sure. Big is a subjective term, and one I'd only accept when you've got participation rankings of all the other sports alongside them.

If you want to have a sport where you shoot, fine. The club owns the guns, and keeps them in a suitably fortified armoury, with alarm systems linked to the Police. People can check guns out of there, and check them back in when they're done. I still don't see the need to have a pistol, but this ruleset would apply there too.

In my mind, people personally owning guns increases the likelyhood that they're going to be used for something other than target shooting. Be it self-defense, or robbery/assault, legally owned or otherwise. And with this increasing likelyhood comes with it a requirement for people breaking the law to arm themselves, and in turn the Police, and in turn the rest of us who don't want a gun, but start to feel that it's necessary ""to be safe"".

This isn't a nanny state issue, guns are designed with a single purpose; killing people, quickly, with minimal training and danger to the aggressor. Any other uses are incidental, or came after that initial design.

People I meet day to day in cars are arrogant, quick to anger, and above all *really* fucking stupid. I'd prefer not to give them another tool to fuck things up with, especially one that is so effective."

He takes credit for everything and even tells me how he's going to have some big party to celebrate my graduation when he has been the greatest hinderance to my academic career and life in general.

Yeah, my ndad was the exact same way.  Told me in high school that he wasn't wasting money on me in college mainly because I was an ungrateful asshole.  He then abandoned me and my siblings soon after that conversation.  Fast forward about 8 years: I'd just graduated college with a BS and his mom had died.  Saw him at her funeral (first time in 8 years) where he started telling everyone how he had helped me through college.  I just laughed at him and walked away.  That was the last time I ever talked to him, he died in 2000.

I don't want to be forced into buying an item every game that's going to make me weaker in combat (compared to if I had spent the gold on a more cost effective item), just so I can put down one extra ward.

I don't often run into the problem of my team not using their trinkets, but in the few games that I do, it's not really that much of a problem. You just have to understand where your team will need vision, and make every ward count. Three wards is more than enough to safely push a tower or go for a dragon/baron. As for keeping objectives warded, just politely ask someone near it to drop a ward.

Note:  ""ffs, someone ward baron,"" is not the correct way to ask your team to ward baron.

TL;DR Make the upgrade to Ruby Sightstone give a gold efficient amount of health, or just remove it. Use your wards wisely, and you won't need more than three."

Exis007,relationships,1390762061.0,"I don't know what you want to hear, man. I mean, are you cheating? Yes. Can this break two people's hearts into pieces? Yes. 

What is it that you're looking for here? You know how this could end. Either they find out or they don't. If they do find out I'd expect divorce for one or both of you. Your wife MIGHT (and this is a tiny 'might') not care so much as you've given up on the sexual part of the marriage. I suppose there's a slim outside possibility that both of your spouses would choose to look the other way to keep the home intact. But the odds are good that if you're discovered this will end in a messy, painful divorce. 

On the other hand, they might not find out and maybe you can keep doing this for awhile. Maybe this just stays the way it is. Is that what you want? Or is what you want to leave your wife and be with this other woman? 

There's no good outcome in this, so there's really no advice to give. Are these few hours snatched in another woman's arms enough? Are you going to need/want more?

A lot of people here will call you a piece of shit for doing this and maybe you are, but we are all capable of doing the shitty thing. Moreover, it is easy to be the uninvolved outsider and scream, ""Asshole!"" from the sidelines when there's nothing at stake and everyone is just an anonymous story. But I think that you and this woman both deserve to be happy and your mutual spouses deserve to have a chance to move on if that's what is going to happen. It is not so tremendously uncommon for people of your age to outgrow what was once a functional, happy marriage due to time, age, and other factors. You're not the same people you once were. If you want to take the perspective that we're all going to die, decay, and become dust then there's only now and the time you've got left so there's no sense wasting it being good and miserable. I'd rather be a happy shithead personally. You'll have to live with what you did, the pain it caused, and the inevitable fall-out but life's tough in the aluminum siding business. You take your lumps, you speak your apologies, you probably pay out the nose, and then you move on. 

I think the bottom line is that there is a high price to pay for not living with integrity. Maybe that price is worth paying, but it is very costly in more ways than one. We can all sit here and judge you but you're the one that has to live with the outcome. As hard as facing the music might be, I don't think it is ever quite as bad as being the adult, telling the truth, taking the consequences, and then making your life what you want it to be. "

The cost of the Olympics are very high, and as other answers point out the costs are usually not recouped. 

So why do cities still fight for it? It's often what the public wants:

&gt;The main reason cities want to host the Olympics is that, perhaps against the odds, they are wildly popular with the voters who foot the bill. The IOC found that public support for hosting the games was around 70% in Tokyo, 76% in Madrid and 83% in Istanbul. Londoners, sometimes a cynical bunch, were in favour of the 2012 games, in spite of dissent from some quarters (including this newspaper, which recommended leaving it to Paris). At the end of last year, with the crowds departed, eight out of ten said it was worth the extraordinary cost, even as cuts to public services began to bite. 


And there can be other intangible benefits:

&gt;The Beijing games were intended to show off Chinaâs spending and organisational power. Londonâs games were a means of bringing back to life a poor part of the capital at a speed that defied normal budgets and planning regulations.

Now, instead of playing along and pretending that the only people who criticize Harper focus on surface-level bullshit, I'll give you a few salient examples of why there's so much more to criticize:

* He holds nearly absolute control over the CPC and uses it to forward his agenda. I say 'nearly' because once in a while someone steps out of line and fucks up his whole machine.

* He has ordered the confiscation of primary scientific data relating to historical trends in Canada's ecology that could undermine his agenda. 

* He has gutted the census, which formerly provided invaluable nationwide economic data that could undermine his agenda.

* He has blatantly disregarded international treaties and continues to erase years of progress in environmental regulation.

* He has used the very filthiest tricks during election season--a proud tradition in Canada to be sure, but one which has rarely been taken to such levels.

* He has adopted a policy of pro-Israel fanaticism that borders on a sociopathic disinterest in the basic human rights of Palestinians.

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1390762608.0,"Please do. It's only an Orthodox echo-chamber BECAUSE Reform members (who are the largest group of all) don't contribute. Chicken, egg.

We mods can't make people contribute, comment, find content, etc. That's where you come in.

We mods can make sure that when people contribute, comment, post content, nothing disrespectful happens. That's where I come in.

""You're not a real Jew because your mom converted Reform."" is disrespectful and I would absolutely issue a warning. This community isn't just for Orthodox (or, in your case, even Conservative!) standards.

I would ask, however, that you understand that for SOME people here, including myself, that there is a possibility that your mom's conversion didn't meet the required standards they believe to come directly from G-d. If they're pointing this out just to be butt munches, I'd absolutely warn them. If they're doing so because this furthers the conversation, or is relevant to the conversation, then, provided it's not state disrespectfully, there's not really much we can (or in my case, I am willing to) do.  We can all treat each other respectfully without agreeing.

So please, absolutely, stick around. Continue to post content and comment. Please DO represent the Reform Jews here. And if you come across something disrespectful, PLEASE send a message to the mods.

You have some really great points here but as someone who's seen WAY too many guys fetishizing various ethnicities specifically because those guys assumed that all the women of those ethnicities were submissive or slave-like in their devotion or freaks in the sheets, I felt I should point out that this does happen."

csreid,loseit,1390762663.0,"There are some other things going on with a carb restricted diet. 

A lot of people starting keto see really dramatic results early on because your muscles store carbs (sort of) in the form of glycogen for quick energy. Glycogen storage also leads to a lot of extra water storage as well. So, when you drastically restrict carbs, the weight from the glycogen and water comes off in a hurry and makes you lose *weight* (not fat) faster. 

Also, carbs do cause an insulin spike. This doesn't make you fat, though. It makes you hungry. Psychologically, this can be tough. Especially if you eat, say, a bowl of cereal or some toast in the morning, because actually waking up also causes an insulin dump, and that compounds with the insulin spike from all the carbs you ate, and you're suddenly ravenous by lunch.

But, all told, eating fewer calories than you burn, no matter where they came from, will result in the same amount of *fat* loss, which is really what you probably want. Cutting out carbs can also hurt athletic performance, so I wouldn't say to do it ever if you also lift or run or work out in any way that pushes yourself. "

Fucking.  Painful.  Keto is the only way of eating I've ever found that keeps me from being constipated.  It doesn't matter how many stool softeners or how much fiber I take, if I'm eating carbs, I either have constipation or diarrhea from the supplements I take to try to alleviate the constipation.  On keto, I can miss one or two nights of fiber supplements and the little stool softener I take and still have a non-painful poop.  In fact, I'm having to scale back the amount of fiber.

So basically, even if I don't lose a single pound, I don't think I'm ever going to eat low-fat high-carb ever again for this single reason.  Because I like being able to sit down when I need to."

Make no mistake, a married partner without job skills, tangible income, an education, or personal ambition lives that way by choice. I don't see why the person who does all the work should enter a legal arrangement to care for this person out a sense of love with the potential to be punished for it if things go poorly. If it goes bad, shouldn't it be the person who didn't contribute monetarily who owes?

If marriage has nothing to do with love, then fine, but that just makes it a really risky business deal, because it has very little benefit to the investor."

Are you from the US? Because you seem to be analyzing the issue through the lens of the US education and economic system.

&gt;What are your goals? To get men jobs? Because that 5-10% difference in college doesn't really mean much job-wise.

1) The gap has been consistently widening.

US - http://www.aei-ideas.org/2013/05/stunning-college-degree-gap-women-have-earned-almost-10-million-more-college-degrees-than-men-since-1982/

2) People with degrees earn more on average than their non-degree counterparts.

US - http://chronicle.com/article/Earnings-Gap-Narrows-but/142175/

3) I think there are more benefits to being education than simply gaining employment. Educated and wealthy areas or nations, have positive correlations with a universally desire social outcome - lower rates of violent crime for example.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlates_of_crime#Socioeconomic_factors

(You can google to find studies indictating postivie correlations with higher socio-economic status and less violent crime, and education and less violent crime) 

Seeing as men are the majority of the victims and perpetrators of violent crime, I hope the above causes you to reconsider your apathy regarding the education gap.

olov244,AskReddit,1390762858.0,"i'm sorry you got so worked up about this. i wish you could see that EVERY country/civilization/culture/etc has their own traditions, some are worse than others, but we all have them(yes even your own whatever it may be). people from other groups cannot understand them, but within those groups it is normal. circumcision has been the norm in many cultures for many many centuries, if you think you can change that by ranting on an internet forum, you're gonna have a bad time. if you think exaggerating the facts will shock people into changing, you're gonna have a bad time. i hope you can understand that and change your methods, but i'm guessing, you'd rather have a bad time

here's a ray of hope, many hospitals here in the evil foreskin hating states, have stopped automatically circumcising babies, and insurances are on the fence about covering the procedure, so if you are a parent that wants one, you're going to have to walk down to the cashier and pay them the $250(maybe more) and bring the receipt to the nurse in order to have it done. needless to say, many parents pass on it these days in my area

and i'll say for the.....3rd time? i don't plan on circumcising my own son if/when i do have one. SO YOU ARE ARGUING WITH SOMEONE THAT AGREES WITH YOU BUT FOR A DIFFERENT REASON!

i hope english is your second language because your reading comprehension sucks"

tanzorbarbarian,IAmA,1390762865.0,"I saw him at a convention a year ago and had a short conversation. He was an incredibly nice guy and offered to draw me a personalized comic of whatever I wanted, so I said ""grumpy panda.""

He got really into it and put quite a bit of effort into the panel. He even stole his assistant's iPad so he could use a picture for reference.  ""Pandas are hard to draw, they're wily little fuckers."" He laughed and signed it for me and now it's sitting on my bookshelf as one of my prized possessions. I'll post a picture when I get home.

*edit* [The Grumpy Panda.](http://i.imgur.com/p3YR4bB.jpg) I'd seen him sitting at the booth doing these for over an hour, but I didn't want to pester him. I waited for the group to disperse and walked up just to give him the old ""Hey, I love your stuff keep up the good work"" spiel when he offered to do this one for me. I felt kinda bad because more people started lining up behind me when they saw he was drawing another one, but he seemed genuinely excited about his work. The assistant was trying to grab the iPad because she needed it to process credit card info, but he kept shooing her away because he needed pictures of pandas for reference. Maybe it's a bit conceited, but I'd like to think he actually enjoyed drawing this one. I know that *I* appreciate it. "

I've never encountered someone who was too small, so I really couldn't say anything to that. Although girth wise too small would probably be anything thinner than two of my fingers (don't have a ruler on me, sorry).

BUT I have had problems with guys being too big. In all honesty I'm more worried about someone being too big for me than too small. I don't know exact measurements, but one guy I've hooked up with needed larger than average condoms. Sex with him wasn't impossible, but certain positions were off-limits as he'd hit my cervix. At one point, in the wrong position with too much power, I literally hopped off him because it hurt too much.

Honestly, you are probably fine. Plus, different women can handle different sizes. What's too big for me is probably perfect for someone else. Even if your size is so extreme one way or another that your dick is ""un-doable"", you've still got fingers and a tongue that can make women putty in your hands.

Even if you have a lovely penis, make sure those other tools know what to do! Foreplay can make or break an experience."

brotherbock,triathlon,1390763217.0,"The reason it's a myth is because a 'calorie' is a poorly defined and *inconsistent* measurement.

You can say 'take in less energy than you expend and you'll lose weight.' But then we measure 'energy' in a way that is not consistent from person to person. Different bodies will expend energy from different sources at different rates. 

It would be fantastic, it really would, if something as complex as the human organism was governed *solely* by one simple thermodynamic principle, and no other factors. The world would be better in many ways if it was in fact simple. But it's not.

What the article argues is that calories from different foods will interact with our bodies in very different ways. Thus the overly simplified CICO mantra is a myth. And it leads to all kinds of trainers and fit people yelling at 'fatties' because, if they aren't losing weight, they must not be following the rules...even when they are. So the belief that a very simple principle governs a body that is unaffected by any other principles in effect leads to discouraged people, and a nation of increasing waistlines.

It's your choice: believe that physics *in practice* is simple and that *all* overweight people who claim to practice CICO are liars, or not."

The66Ripper,AskMen,1390763262.0,"Keeping your T-shirts and Underwear clean are always a good way to make sure you don't smell bad, but in terms of smelling good, there are a bunch of things I do for other purposes that make me smell good. 

For example, I use a nice shampoo/conditioner combo (2 bottles, not a 2-in-1, those don't work) from Aveda called ""Dry Remedy"" that helps with my dandruff problem. Along with helping my dry scalp, it smells really nice. Another hair product I use is a Styling Cream/Retexturing Gel combo called Brilliant that I mix and rub in together. They have a distinctively manly smell and my friends have mistaken it for a very subtle cologne before. 

As far as aftershave/moisturizer, avoid anything that has an ""ointment"" smell. You might recognize this as the ""lotion/lube"" smell you might encounter when out and about. Generally all of the facial moisturizers I've encountered don't have that smell, but I know a lot of people who don't distinguish between body moisturizers and face moisturizers. If you're one of those people, I'd suggest investing in a nice men's moisturizer, my personal favorite is the Neutrogena Men's Triple Protect Lotion. It works as an aftershave, moisturizer and 20SPF sunscreen. 

Also, a really small amount of cologne could be a good call. (but not mixed with all of these things, if it's a cologne day, go light deodorant only, you don't want all of the fragrances on your body to interact in an unpleasant way.) The best way to moderate how much you use is by spraying on your wrist at an angle so that only 1/3-2/3 of the spray actually hits the wrist. 

Spraying on your wrist (pulse point specifically) rather than in the air or on the front of your neck will help the fragrance disperse more slowly so that as your blood pumps through the day, it will release the scent gradually. This works especially well with higher end fragrances (my personal favorite is an Armani cologne called ""Black Code"" which was shortly after replaced by ""Code."" which is a slightly less sensual form of Black Code.) as these higher end fragrances are developed to morph and change over time and between wearers based upon their natural scent. More specifically, if I wear Black Code and you wear Black Code, it won't smell the same on us because the cologne works with each person's natural scent. Also, as a rule of thumb, higher end fragrances tend to be more mild, but more complex than celebrity fragrances or designer's low end fragrances."

4.  Right now I own a 60"" TV, Xbox One console and a cable box.
5.  Source for music will likely be the Xbone - I use Xbox Music.
6.  Typical usage would be for TV, movies, Sports, and console gaming.
7.  I would prefer to buy new over used.

I know nothing about brands for this equipment so I'm really looking for help and direction.  Here is my current setup:

Right now there is a PS3, Xbox 360, and an Xbox One in there, but I will remove the two older consoles.

If you look closely above the computer desk chair, there is a chord coming out of the brick wall - there is pre-wired cables coming out on each side.  This was already in place when I moved in.

Sex and anxiety don't go hand in hand. First off, you should do all you can to make the guy feel relaxed and above all, has no pressure to perform. Not sure how you are with your guys but some guys might find you intimidating. Maybe you're very attractive. Maybe you talk to them about bad sexual performances in your past, putting the pressure to perform well on them. I don't know, but the point stands.

That's what you can do yourself. If you can talk to the guy and get him to recognize the problem, he might be able to work on it too. It's mostly mental, as I said, and if you give him good support he can probably work through it.

There are also numbing creams and thick condoms etc. Not familiar with any of these things though."

goundo,climbing,1390763466.0,"While, physically, yes, any person could rap down with a bolt gun now and make this a well protected line, that would be a dick move.

The ethics of outdoor climbing are complicated, and vary depending on the area you go to. Generally, though, once the first ascentionist climbs a new route, that route is ""theirs"". It can be thought of as a work of art, that the FA had the vision to see and produce, and you don't go around editing someone's art. The FA can give permission for bolts to be added after the fact, or can go up and do it themselves, but this generally doesn't happen. Until the FA dies, modifying the route without their permission would be an outrageous disrespect to the route, the FA, and the climbing community in general.

This plays into the idea of what it means to be a good climber. Being good at climbing is about more than pulling hard moves and decoding sequences. A good climber should have a strong head when they get into a sketchy situation, and, more importantly, should be able to evaluate when a route is over their head and back off. Someone climbing in good style is in complete control the whole time, and should not care if they are on a well protected sport route, a sketchy trad route, or a high-exposure solo. If they are climbing in good style, they will not fall where it is not safe.

Basically, the thing to understand here is that just because a route has bolts, doesn't mean it is a sport route."

superior22,summonerschool,1390763520.0,"The amount of gold you get for a kill is dependent on killing / death sprees.  You get 300g for your first kill on your opponent, 275g for the next kill on him, 220g for the third and so on. With every death his value decreases. If he kills someone his bounty gets a reset and his death is worth 300g again. Assist streaks will eventually reset his bounty too. Every 1.000g he earned through minions / jungle camps will reduce his death spree by one.

The more kills an opponent had without dying to someone on your team the more gold you get for shutting him down. If he's got two kills without dying you get 360g for killing him, 3 kills on him will gain you 432g and 5 (and more) will be worth 500g.

&gt;**Bounty values (""shutting"" an opponent down)**
&gt;
&gt;1st kill: 300 gold	
&gt;
&gt;2nd kill: 360 gold	
&gt;
&gt;3rd kill: 432 gold (Killing spree)
&gt;
&gt;4th kill: 500 gold (Rampage)	
&gt;
&gt;5th kill: 500 gold (Unstoppable)
&gt;

&gt;**Death spree**

&gt;1st death: 300 gold

&gt;3rd death: 220 gold
&gt;
&gt;4th death: 176 gold
&gt;
&gt;5th death: 141 gold
&gt;
&gt;6th death: 112 gold
&gt;
&gt;7th death: 90 gold
&gt;
&gt;8th death: 72 gold
&gt;
&gt;9th death: 58 gold
&gt;
&gt;10th+ death: 50 gold

Remember, if he gets a kill during his death spree his bounty will get a reset back to 300g.



As for the level advantages, because he's a level above his base stats will increase. If the enemy has better base stats the gap will be closed a bit and an extra point in an ability can be a huge difference. Take Jax' Empower for example. A level 1 W will deal 40 (+60% AP) damage, level 2 W does 75 (+60% AP). Jinx' Q steroid increases from 30% attack speed on level 1 to 55% attack speed on level 2. Elise's spider Q damage increases from 60 on level 1 to 110 on level 2 and so on."

wraith313,AskMen,1390763613.0,"I'll suggest this: It's because you are alone. *Humans* (not just guys) rely on society and on social cues to interact with people. If you are going around doing everything alone, people will assume either: You want to be alone or (more likely) there is something about you that other members of society have shunned away. Thus: they won't go out of their way to interact with you. Try doing things with some of your friends more or meeting some new people (you will have to put in extra work initially) and you will find your fortunes changing.

Guys are the same way. The guys who never get laid often (also) have few friends and don't go out in groups and are socially awkward. The ones who get laid all the time are, surprise, popular with people and have good social skills. 

It is nobodies fault, really. But you have to put in extra work to make yourself social if you aren't already.

Edit: Also: The lonely ones aren't lonely because theres something wrong with them. It's because they have bad social skills. Likewise, the popular ones arent popular because they are beautiful or amazing, its because they *have* good social skills. And social skills can be learned. "

I mean, I see ftm shit all over the place now, but given my position that makes a lot of sense because I am specifically attuned to and looking for that info.

I also don't agree that a difference in numbers (if there is one, and I don't think there's a significant difference), necessarily means all that much socially. I mean, Brandon Teena was murdered 20 years ago now and we are still talking about him, and he had a major motion picture devoted to him and his being murdered. Trans female spectrum people are much much more likely to be the victims of transphobic violence, yet I don't think any of the murder victims who were trans women have the name recognition he has. 

Personally I have found trans men treated much more respectfully in the mainstream media, and that is probably more overall important than numbers.

So accurate"
Noumenology,occult,1390763679.0,"woah. I was just thinking about this exactly the same time you were posting it. 

My first reaction to those thoughts was that occult knowledge is on par with ""mysteries"" and esoterica in other religions and it may be worth pursuing a traditional religious education (tempered by the guidance and critical skepticism of their parents) for children so that they are familiar with a basic spiritual/religious framework. Then, when they are older, they can begin to explore the mysteries. 

As an example, [traditional Judaism](http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380334/jewish/Kabbalah-Before-Age-40.htm) doesn't permit anyone to study the Kabblah until they are 40 and older as well as experts in the Talmund and Halakha. This doesn't mean that people don't do whatever they want, but it does speak to a long practice of ""first lets get the basics down, then when you're ready, we'll move you up to graduate studies with Truth 501.""

So, unless you want to pursue a pagan education for your kids, then might be best to wait until introducing them to the occult. Or let them self-introduce if they are willing. Remember that there are reasons for initiations and gradual education - developmentally speaking kids are unstable and forming their psyches. My impression is that premature ego-death could be psychologically catastrophic."

His source Marc's Twitter:

The question by EnzerDeLeo
&gt; @Marc_IRL I have a question, Marc. **""Content"" refers to** resource packs, adventure maps, **mod**, etc. correct?  :) 


Marc's Answer:
&gt; @EnzerDeLeo **Yes**, there are not restrictions on our use of public content created for the game. But we've never been jerks about it :-)


So how can slowpoke be correct, when we directly have a question about the definition of content (which slowpoke claims does not represent **mods**) and an answer by Marc saying that 'Yes' content does include mods? And if they are considered content, are thereby subject to the part that slowpoke specifically says they're not, even though Marc says they are. I guess one could interpret that to say that only mojang can distribute how they want not the users but, it still puts slowpokes interpretations into question."

CaspianX2,PoliticalDiscussion,1390763929.0,"I can't say I'm an expert on this, but in my experience, for the most part the Democratic party doesn't have ""branches"" or ""wings"".

Yes, there are (or at this point to a greater extent ""were"") the Blue Dog Democrats, Democrats in Red states who had to stay close to center for fear of losing elections. There are far-left liberals (""radical"" liberals) who tend to be seen as voters rather than candidates (though they *really* like Alan Grayson and Elizabeth Warren). There are establishment liberals (like Pelosi, Reid, and Boxer) who are in fairly safe districts and just do whatever the heck they like. And then there are fringe elements, independents like Bernie Sanders and Angus King, who aren't technically Democrats (they're Independents), but they caucus with Democrats, meaning they're likely going to be easier for Democrats to work with than Republicans.

Now, maybe those aren't the most apt descriptions. I don't know. But the thing is, it doesn't really matter, because Democrats by and large act as individuals, and haven't signed any silly ""party pledge"", and aren't huge on ""party purity"". There are certainly issues that Democrats tend to band together on, but even things like the major policies of the president (such as the Affordable Care Act) tend to require a lot of talking, negotiation, and compromise even within the party before they can proceed. More recently, Obama couldn't even get support from his own party for his approach to Syria.

This is why you don't often hear people talking about ""factions"" within the Democratic Party. And in my experience ""Democrat"" often *is* interchangeable with ""liberal"", but to a greater or lesser extent depending on where they're from and what issue you're talking about. For example, post-9/11 you'll be hard-pressed to find a Democrat calling for a reduction to the military budget. And Obama has been criticized for continuing Bush's unpopular (especially with liberals and libertarians) intelligence operations, but I don't think it'd be fair to say he's not liberal - he's just not liberal on those issues.

Anyway, this is just my opinion, for whatever that's worth."

Much of that red seems to be in republican areas.

http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/jan/12/occupy-democrats/pro-democrat-group-says-9-10-poorest-states-are-re/

Correlation doesn't mean causation as I said, there's more factors at work, but I remember reading somewhere that while red states typically have lower unemployment, their average wages are a couple dollars lower.

http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324296604578179603136860138

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/10/how-right-to-work-laws-could-reshape-michigans-economy/

Now, I don't deny that the correlation is kind of muddy. obviously there are some examples of red states with good economies, and blue states with poor ones. There are other factors at work. You or someone else mentioned some of the structures in the south that lead to inequality, but at the same time, right wing successes likely follow a similar pattern. One thing I noticed about a lot of these western red states that seem so successful, would they happen to be dominated by the energy industry, by any chance? I notice ND is having a massive boom, and a lot of that is due to the oil exploration up here. And when I look at states like Montana and Wyoming following a similar pattern, I'd suspect a lot of those economic successes are due to small populations (with few urban centers, which are often where poverty is concentrated) combined with a booming oil industry. That being said, I think it's silly to link economic success with republican policies, when other things are at work.

Now, you do have a point, republican states have lower unemployment, but they also generally have lower wages and higher poverty. So it's not like republican policies are really any better than democratic ones, despite the spin."

Keep in mind that you're more concerned with *mass*, with how lean you are, than with the number on the scale. You *are* building muscle with these workouts as you burn fat. Muscle is denser than fat, so as you build muscle and lose fat, you may not actually weigh less. But you may be losing the belly.

But TRP is conservative/reactionary in much the same way. Stating that one deals with the is and not the ought is a common enough rhetorical move for many conservatives (see, for example, realist theory in international relations), as are political claims based on human nature. 

Here's the thing. I don't think that women, as a collective group, or feminism, as an ideology, can ultimately be blamed for the destabilization of masculine roles, any more than we could think of patriarchy as a deliberate or effective conspiracy on the part of men against women. Those roles have mostly been destabilized by shifts in the economy and the labor market. If you want an ultimate culprit, blame capitalism.

Your follow up the a reply:
&gt; This exact attitude of entitlement is why you're losing modders.

That is where you lumped.

And here you unlump yourself and a few others after doing your own lumping:

&gt; I also don't think it's fair to take those vocal few's bad behavior,

And to this:
&gt; What about their rights as coders? As people? At what point is it okay to say ""the person who created this has no opinion on how it can be used or distributed""? Is it ever okay? I don't think it is.

They forfeit those when they make a derivative creation based on someone elses work after agreeing to that other persons terms, and then releasing their creation to the public at large. If they want all the rights to decide who, when, how and where they're code is used, they can write their own voxel game and include their mod and release that completely stand alone. Eloraam I believe was working on something similar to this, but I don't think it ever got off the ground.

bubbish,AskMen,1390764586.0,"I think the article sums it up well, but you should always take these things with a grain of salt.

It's definitely good to read up on and practice reading body signals. It's fairly easy because we have a built in ability to pick up signals, so you just need to start becoming aware. Be advised however, that you can only learn to read signals. Learning to act on them properly is an entirely different story.

The most powerful signals are the ones girls do without thinking. A lingering gaze, increased touching of hair, looking down after eye contact, smiling etc. There are many little cues you can learn about and it's actually a lot of fun to do. Just have it in the back of your mind while talking to people. Also, it's SO much easier to see these signals when watching two other people conversing. Try looking for girls and guys who are in the process of hooking up at the club or something. Make a game of it, see if you were right about who the girls liked.

Native Americans were extremely far from united (to say the least) even before the diseases that arrived with Europeans  showed up and wiped out anywhere from 40% to 90% of their population (depending on whose population model you think is correct).  After that, they were even more fragmented and constantly leveraged the military power of the European settlers against one another, either through offering rewards (such as these bounties) or making treaties and agreements with the settlers.  It also happened on larger scales.  The Iroquois Confederacy, which was one of the largest united native groups in North America, actually played a delicate diplomatic game and set the English and French against each another as well as their native enemies for nearly thirty years."

Arqueete,AskWomen,1390764718.0,"I love *Pure Heroine* and listen to it regularly. I like the whole vibe of the album and her voice, and lyrically it has some really great moments as well-- at times I think she seems to be not-entirely-convincingly trying to sound older and more worldly than she probably is, but there are times where I think she does such a nice job of capturing teenage experiences in a way that isn't too generic or cliche.

I don't really follow her outside of listening to her album, and I've heard that she's said some controversial things e.g. about other artists but I haven't heard anything that sounded like more than a teenager being opinionated and perhaps a little cocky--I give slack to young people who are thrust into the spotlight in the way she has been. I feel like, assuming her fame doesn't end up being too detrimental, that her music and her handling of interviews will only improve as she matures."

Skulder,Games,1390764892.0,"I think his point was something else.

If you buy a card that's in the high range, it'll last you longer.

For example - I just bought a R9 290. I bought it to replace my AMD 5870 from 2009. The 5780 wasn't the most expensive GPU on the market at the time, but it was pretty good, and I think it was $300 or so. If I had bought a card that *at the time* was just good enough to give me 60fps at low or medium settings, I would have had to replace it sooner.

Of course, it's important to find a balance. While a $300 card might last you five years, a $600 card won't last you ten years, nor will a $150 card last you 2.5 years... Or maybe it will? Anyway the point remains - investing a bit more will give you increasing returns, until you reach the point of diminishing returns.

Buying a card that lies in that sweet spot often results in something in the $2-300 range (for me at least. The R9 290 has been an exception)."
TheLittleGoodWolf,IAmA,1390764895.0,"&gt;Whether or not they specifically put the explicit definition under the header of ""Rape"" above, it is measured within the report and is considered within their larger findings of overall sexual assault.

and:
&gt;Too few men reported rape in the 12 months prior to taking the survey to produce a reliable 12 month prevalence estimate.

Are what my problem is. The report makes no attempts to hide the fact that they do not consider being ""made to penetrate"" to be rape. So as I stated in an earlier response, the low amount of men reporting ""rape (forced penetration)"" in the last 12 months does not have anything to do with the amount who reported ""being made to penetrate"". This is the whole issue. There was about the same amount of men reporting being ""made to penetrate"" as there were women reporting ""rape (forced penetration)"" in the last 12 month period. Allowing ""made to penetrate"" to be a part of ""rape"" would thus yeild a (statistically valid according to the survey) 50/50 division of male and female victims within the last 12 months. This figure is interesting because it has (TMK) never been heard of before.

&gt;You can't use a stat from a source to lend credence to your argument when the stat itself is told to be unreliable by your very source.

And then you say, in the same post:
&gt;I assumed the authors saying the 12 year data for males was too low to draw a conclusion was inclusive of all of the 12 year male data, not where specifically marked.

I assume you mean months and not years but I don't like to edit quotes.

So we are back to where we started pretty much, I will agree that if using the lifetime reports there is a huge difference between male and female rapes. (This is of course under the pretext that ""made to penetrate"" is put under the definition of rape, the following will be under the same conditions.) There is however (as stated before) pretty much no difference when you look at the latest 12 months, that is interesting and something worthy of mention IMO.

&gt;You entire issue with the specific definition of rape doesn't pertain to your original point that men and women are raped/sexually assaulted on the same scale. 

Yes it does! Terminology and definitions of terms are important because you need do know exactly what is measured when you discuss the findings. As I said earlier, my number one issue is that being ""made to penetrate"" is not classified as rape because I consider it to be rape. The importance of the terminology arises when you make this simple change because suddenly you have a huge difference in the division of victims from before.

I made no statement of the rate of sexual assault, sexual assault contains many different actions only one of which is rape, they are not interchangeable.

&gt;If you have an issue with the specific academic definition, fine. But it isn't skewing the data here because it is being accounted for. Regardless of what it's specifically called. And it doesn't show that men and women are equally assaulted.

No it doesn't show that they are equally assaulted, it does show (allowing for ""made to penetrate"" to be a part of rape) that in the last 12 months (of the study) there are an equal number of individual victims. Which was the point of my original comment (or one of the earlier ones at least... I forget.). "

Jayfrin,martialarts,1390764973.0,"Wing Chun is like any other martial art. There are plenty of people who never use it and still talk like they could beat up anyone at all. It really depends on person and school. I don't have any videos off hand but I could dig some up if you're interested. I have used Wing Chun in real fights and sparring, against boxers and MMA and other Kung Fu styles and yes I have found my school's system and training effective. But this is extremely variant on the school one attends and the personal commitment.  

The common argument is ""if it's effective why don't people use it in the octagon,"" it's hard to find a good school who is interested in training people toward competitive fighting because this goes against typical Chinese philosophy, which comes often comes hand in hand with the style.

However, similar to what u/landomansdad said there's a lot of disagreement within the Wing Chun style. There's traditionalist who basically worship Yip Man and think he's infallible, and there are non-orthodox who change almost everything about the style to be relevant and feel like they are revolutionizing the style. There's also many many lineages, much of which hate each other and are overzealous about their personal technique being the ""best"". There are plenty of schools that never spar or fight but still act like they know everything and some who have much experience sparring and fighting but no interest in going out and ""proving"" their skill. There's also people who study for simple self defense or culture of fun and don't care if they can beat people up in a fight. So that all said there are several schools that teach useful martial arts or real fights but it's really hard to figure out which is which without going and sparring them for certain. There are just way too many variables for any one particular person's success or failure to be considered a judgment of the effectiveness of the System.   

Hope that helps. I'm open to more discourse on this topic if you're interested."

Over a certain level of wealth/education/consumerism/existentialism people stop having babies. So overpopulation in the long term is a a non-issue.

No, governments should never intervene in anything, from study to effect it's a convoluted path managed by idiots.

They did in China and every socialist ""utopia"" that ever existed.

We wont reach that level, at least without government interventions or a cultural shift. Also Bangladesh is much more tragic case.

jenniferocious,AskMen,1390765101.0,"Just wanted to say, while I'm not male, I totally feel you. I was never kissed or asked on a date until I was in my mid-20s. I was never asked to dance at high school dances (and eventually gave up on attending them all together). I had a handful of guy friends, but had literally *never* had any romantic-type male attention at all. It crippled my self image pretty badly, watching every other girl I knew go out on dates and stuff while I sat home every night. I was constantly comparing myself to other girls i knew (""I'm prettier/smarter/nicer than her, why does she get dates when i can't?""). I was convinced that it was because something was fundamentally wrong or unappealing about me. I spent an unhealthy amount of time picking myself apart, trying to find out what the horrible fault was. I'm not a mean or unpleasant person, not especially attractive but not ugly either. In school I wasn't picked on or anything traumatic like that, it was like I simply didn't exist to other people. Which hurt in its own special way. 

I had pretty much made my peace with spinsterhood in my early-mid 20s. It sucked and I was depressed about it, but I had accepted it as inevitable. But I had this guy friend who I'd known online for over a year, and one summer he came to visit for a week. He gave me my first kiss(es), we went out on my first date, and 5 years after we first met we got married. Sometimes I still feel a little like I missed out on something because I never dated like a ""normal"" person, but I couldn't be happier with my husband. 

Looking back, I'm still not sure what the problem was. I was fairly shy and introverted, but I don't think that can account for all of the issues I had. A lot of my shyness came from the fact that my self image was so low because I felt so overlooked. It was just a big cyclical mess. 

Anyway, I know this doesn't answer your question at all. But I thought I'd let you know you aren't alone, even though it may feel like you are. I know I felt like the only unappealing dateless freak in the world when I was going through it, I would have liked to know that other people had similar situations. "

Besides the fact that I have actually seen mines and do actually live in a northern industry town and I am quite aware of what industry does to local environments that's all a distraction from my point. 

My point is that if you want to be taken seriously you have to be aware of how others perceive you. Your child molestation analogy might (emphasis on might) be accurate, but it is your choice of words that throws people off. And the fact that you still haven't presented anything factual beyond ""step out of your box man"" and ""check out these pictures I found online"". 

I'm okay with environmentalism. I think that when it's well executed it can spur on significant change. This isn't about that. It's about your presentation. So instead, try something that people will actually listen to,for example: ""these new changes go through caribou routes. What are you going to do to ensure that those herds are not affected?"" Or ""these areas host some delicate, endangered plant/animal species, how can we protect them?"" Do you get my drift? You can't say no to development. You'll never win. You have to have goals. What is protecting the environment? Where is the balance between protection and development to you? When you start finding those answers and putting that on the table, that's how you get results. 

Oh and regarding cleanup costs, the net is still profit for the taxpayers. Even at 90 million or whatever, these industries bring in unreal tax dollars. Never mind the economic benefits gained by the millions of dollars they pay their employees. "

**Goal**: 83-84

This week I tried to train for most of it but was pretty easy on myself because of a medical procedure. I was also on-call. 

****

**Monday**: 8.5 miles at 8:11 pace. Slowed down considerably after my friend split off, but that's OK, I needed it. 

**Tuesday**: Off for procedure.

**Wednesday**: 7 at 8:20 pace. A little less tired than I expected to be after the procedure, honestly.

**Thursday AM**: AM 10.25 with a Fartlek. Long, easy warm-up into 3 x 2:00 on, 1:00 off, into an easy cool-down. Only took one split and it was a 90, a bit slow, but I expected to be tired.

**Thursday PM**: 4.5 mile easy shakeout at 8:05.

**Friday**: 7.5 at 8:06 + strides. Felt very tired.

**Saturday**: Practice, 9.15 (ew) total with a 3 mile tempo at 6:40 pace. Easy workout but needed it after this week. Started a bit slow and ended a bit fast, felt decent. Some strides after with fast turnover.

**Sunday**: 15 at 7:38. 3 alone and the rest with a group. We were pretty fast for the middle chunk of this (ran a few 7:20s). I felt good, but I have a bone spur on the top of my foot from my night splint and arch support, which means my PF is a little off since I can't wear them, which means I need to take extra good care of it otherwise.

****

Total about 62. Nothing too hard and cut out some strength and all core. Clearly glycogen-depleted on Friday (had to fast for the thing). Run went OK but I was just exhausted all day after. Appetite hasn't been great either.

I'm going to try my first 75 mile week next week. It will be tough but I think the timing is good and then I can back off immediately and do 55 the week after before my 5K. Just need to make sure that my PF doesn't flare up as an indirect result of this bone spur."

This left the only option for retreat for the Persians to use was the sea behind them. Basically it turned into a scramble to make it off the beach and into the boats before they could be slaughtered by the Greeks. The Persians were pretty much enveloped by the Greeks on three sides and the Aegean Sea at the rear.
But we know that the Greeks were so successful that they were able to launch a counter-attack into Persia and burn the city Sardis.

So basically you have a Greek force consisting of 10,000 men against a Persian invasion force at least twice the size of the Greeks *and* the Persians contained cavalry which I think the Greeks lacked at Marathon. That is why I'm asking the question.

Kay, so let me give you some more links that are more clear on the matter.

[Here](http://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1bw6c6/what_on_earth_is_rtheredpill/c9blkzt) he is saying:

&gt;The reason why our member was arguing that spousal rape isn't real is simple: Based on the contracts that made marriage a thing back in the day- spousal rape really couldn't exist. Obviously in today's legal atmosphere, spousal rape does exist in the legal sense, which is one of the core reasons we feel that marriage in itself has lost meaning...Is spousal rape a thing? You have to consider what men and women brought to the table of marriage. Men would bring provisions, women would bring a womb...women have found a way to renege on the only feature they brought to the marriage: the womb and access to it...To say the least, if women renege on the access to womb, then the marriage contract concept is broken in and of itself and can no longer be taken seriously...

Someone replies to him, he replies back:

&gt;But spousal rape in theory should not be a thing. If a woman does not wish to submit to her husband she should not marry him. **The contract of marriage is the verbal and written consent for sex.** [Bolding original.]

I'm basically speaking from experience, living in a poor city with a struggling public school system since forever made worse by laying off tons of teachers, which makes class sizes go up. 

I'll tell you what, you prove ME wrong. I already provided sources. Don't like them? Look up[ your own darn stuff because i dont even know where to begin looking to find easily digestable test score data and I'm not gonna waste my time looking (that's if test scores are even a reliable indicator in the first place, which i'm not sure they are).

Because it looks pretty darn clear that funding is a major factor.

http://researchcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/9-6-12-pic.png

Areas that have more funding generally have better results, this is common sense. Funding obviously doesn't make up all the difference but it seems logical to believe it makes up a lot of it.

I totally agree that it is kinda meta to put a 'free-for-all' thread in a sub that is, at it's heart, one big 'free-for-all' but I think this thread could be a good idea for a few reasons. 

First, we've had a couple people aren't feeling like the things they want to talk about are worth a whole post or they're not brave enough to write up a whole post and risk it being a dud because no one else wants to talk about it. Also, the census that I started yesterday is revealing that we've got a lot more lurkers than I had thought so this kind of free form thread will hopefully appeal to those who aren't as confident or aren't as active and encourage them to jump into the conversation without the commitment of posting a separate thread.

Second, with the things like weekly reality shows, I think this thread could appeal to people who like the groups putting them out but don't want to watch the show as it's coming out. For example, I like EXO but I don't watch their reality show with any regularity so if someone who does watch it posts a sort of TL;DW here and says this week it was particularly funny or it had a lot of one of my biases in it I might go back and check it out.

That's the idea, anyway! If it ends up being really redundant or doesn't get much traffic we'll talk about doing away with it but I'm hopeful that this kind of open ended thread could do really well!"

superior22,summonerschool,1390765836.0,"&gt;Do you think he is overpowered, or does the reward from his all-in and risky play style make up for it?

I think he is in a good spot. An exceptional Draven player will make him look overpowered but you have to keep your axes up which isn't as easy as it sounds, especially in team fights.

&gt;Is his newer passive more of a nerf or a buff for his snowball potential?

Definitely nerf. A necessary one though. If we look at Wicked Blades (his old passive) *Draven's critical strikes deal 30 + (4 Ã level) bonus physical damage over 4 seconds. Spinning Axe also causes this effect even if it does not critically strike.* Basically every auto attack with spinning axes gave you an free ignite on your enemy.

The new passive is hit or miss. If you catch your axes and cash in you can get a ridiculous amount of bonus gold. I think I got like 2k extra gold just from the passive in a game recently. If you however die the passive is more or less useless.

&gt;Which supports have the best synergy with Draven?

Annie, Thresh, Leona, Nami, Blitzcrank, Fiddlesticks, probably Lulu

&gt;Which supports are the best against Draven?

Anyone with hard CC.

&gt;Statik Shiv or Phantom Dancer, and why?

Most of the time Shiv. Draven has bad wave clear (despite one-shooting caster minions relatively early). The burst on Shiv is great for mid game fights and as a Draven you should be able to get your items fast if you keep the passive going.

&gt;What team comps does Draven shine in?

Draven does well in any team comp but works extremely well in a pick comp. A pick comp always looks for small skirmishes to blow someone up. If a Draven gets fed he can two-three shot most squishy champions. I wouldn't pick him in a siege comp though. Draven is an ""*in your face*"" champion and you have to commit to a fight. If you stand back and siege you'll probably lose your spinning axes if your team doesn't allow you to hit something in between.

&gt;What team comps do well against Draven?

ADC's aren't really ""countered"" by comps because they're always in the back. If the enemy however has multiple champions with hard CC, or someone who can just dive on you, you might want to pick someone else.

&gt;Do you feel Draven works well in the meta? Or are the popular ADCs too strong?

Draven is one of the strongest ADC picks in the current meta. Jinx, Lucian, Draven and Sivir are the top 4 right now.

&gt;Does Draven work as a counter for the popular ADCs, or is it more dependent on a skill match up?

Draven gained popularity again because he shits on the ""popular"" AD's in lane. Lucian, widely considered one of the biggest lane bullies bot lane will lose a straight up fight with Draven. If he misses one of his skill shots he instantly lost the fight, if he hits everything Draven will probably still kill him first. Same goes for Jinx. If she can't abuse her range and stay out of Draven's range she will die.

They all out scale him (Jinx the most) once it comes to late game and Draven didn't snowball, but when you pick Draven it's not your intention to let it come to late game in the first place.

BrockN,Hungergames,1390765958.0,"I agree with a few of your points, however for the below...

District 1: I don't agree that it's located in Mexico, the movie or book doesn't portrait any Mexicans, it appears to be entirely Caucasian. If its industry is gems including diamonds, there's only 2 diamond mines in United States, located in Arkansas, and Colorado. Colorado would be a more likely candidate given its close location to the Capitol. However given the map in the movie, it isn't even anywhere near the Capitol or District 2, I suppose Arkansas it is?

District 3: Not even shown on the map in the movie, somewhere in the Eastern seaboard of the United States? I agree with your point that it would be in Silicon Valley based on its description in the book.

District 4: Shown as along the West Coast, not exactly a strong source of fishing compared to the East, however given the polar ice cap melting, it may have a significant effect on the fishing industry along the East Coast, enough for the Capitol to consider the West to be its main source of fishing?

District 5: I don't think it's Arizona, I think it's Nevada. If you look closely at the map, you can see mountain ranges to the West between District 5 and 4 which looks like Yosemite Park.

If you look at the [entire map](http://justsomething.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/earth-look-like-ice-melted-11.jpg) of what North America looks like after polar ice cap melted and compare it to the [map on CF](http://i.imgur.com/Jxi0ziQ.png). I think District 5 is actually Las Vegas.

On the other hand, if you look at the total energy production of [Nevada](http://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=NVO) vs [Arizona](http://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=AZ), Arizona outperforms NV in everyway assuming nothing changes

District 6: Another hard one, if we break it down to major source of transportation; Aerospace, Boats, Train. In the movie and book, both Aerospace and Train were the main source of transportation, boats are obviously needed for the fishing industry of District 4 but that's the only mentions of it.

As for Aerospace, the largest manufacturer of aircrafts are located in Washington, Ohio, and Quebec. Washington is out since District 7 is located in Northwest. Ohio and Missouri is more likely contender as it is the state in which Boeing has factories. 

I'm unsure of whereabouts of rail industries in the US or Canada.

District 13: Southeast Ontario. The book mentioned that it is located in Northeast region, major industry is mining graphite and nuclear development. The largest graphite mines in North America is in Kearney, Ontario while one of the biggest Canadian nuclear lab is located in Chalk River, Ontario which isn't that far from Kearney."

It feels limited, and many of the descriptions I have read of lawful alignments define it more fully as an adherence to a particular code, a sense of order or hierarchy, or just being highly disciplined or principled.  If a lawful character sees this empire as genuinely a force of evil or destruction, a perversion of true order, or a threat to a more legitimate authority, I'd say he could do it.

What kind of alignment effects are you talking about?  Since the character is a monk, do you mean possibly losing monk abilities for not being lawful?  As a DM, I do not take one act as an indication of an alignment; it has more to do with justification, habits, priorities, and attitude.  Additionally, I would not consider alignment effects over just one action - that calls for a conversation about how and why the character is behaving this way and what direction the player wants to go with it."

Zexks,feedthebeast,1390766552.0,"&gt; I'm not sure what you're trying to say with the whole ""lumping"" thing, so I'll just move on to your final point:

I'm literally using your own words here, it's not that complicated.

EnDeLe said

&gt; You can't lump in a few needy people out the 13 million users for minecraft to be the representation of the entire user group.

In response to the same argument you posted here and you still missed it. While simultaneously 'lumping' (ie your post ""I've yet to lump in any group of people with anyone,"") all the users together:

&gt; Modders are far too often treated like sub-human servants even in the existing system. People make ridiculous demands of them, people insult them for not giving them more free stuff faster, people treat them like garbage.

&gt; It still doesn't change what is, to me, a surprisingly large segment of players being aggressive and even hostile to modders being a real thing, and in the end, contributes far more to modders' departure than any semantic argument over distribution rights ever could. In the end, they feel under-appreciated, scorned, abused, and excluded. Telling them they have no rights only reinforces this view for them.

Then trying to unlump (ie your post ""I also don't think it's fair to take those vocal few's bad behavior,"") mod authors.

So you want to 'lump' all users into a group of whiny, hateful, demanding users (while claiming you're not), and simultaneously trying to 'unlump' any whiny, hateful, destructive mod authors an absolve any blame.

&gt; If we're not talking about what is driving modders off, then I don't think we're having the same discussion, and I'll quietly step away from this. :)

Then where did all of the following come into play:

&gt; The EULA has not, to my knowledge, changed significantly in the last two years, as it pertains to modding. Mojang has never come out and said ""modders are sub-human, and their works are the property of the people"". Generally, both parties seem to respect each other.
I don't think changing the EULA to make mods public domain is ""giving better freedoms to all"", I think it's giving better freedoms to the end-user, while excluding the creator.

Were these intended to be facetious:

&gt;What about their rights as coders? As people? At what point is it okay to say ""the person who created this has no opinion on how it can be used or distributed""? Is it ever okay?

The fact is, this is what it is to be famous in any circle. Some will love you, some will hate you, not matter what you do. The internet is full of people both good and bad, polite and rude. If you can't handle some hate stay away from fame, do not seek the spotlight, most especially on anything to do with the internet. Yeah it sucks people smack on some authors, but I can't say I feel incredibly sorry for them. Did they not expect to get some hate once they reached a certain popularity, in a game with a player base in the multi millions. Even if odds are 1 in 1000 people are douches, that still a shit ton of douches, thicken up and get used to it, or get out of the light, as you're probably not cut out for it."

This would encourage Japan and China to consider switching to the Euro for international stability and transnational efficiency, yes this would be a issue for the dollar, as a huge volume of dollars is used outisde the US, a lot of that  money will return to the US, which can create a very strong inflationary pressure. But nothing the Fed can't handle.

It's not really that easy, beyond the ""another strong economy"" there is the issue of a imense increase in monetary volume which could have inflationary effects due to the faster monetary speed of the british economy. But it's going to flat out over time. 

The issue with Greece and spain is productivity relative to the interest rate, money is to cheap for compared to how much people actually produce/add value. This combined with an inefficient and wasteful government that gets easy money and has no interest in being fiscally responsible gives you a social economic puzzle in which the euro is just a piece.

The stats on a drop you get depend on the level of monster you kill and the rarity of the weapon. When opening a chest, it's the level of the monsters that spawned next to it that determines the level of the chest.

A q8 max damage gold or purple weapon can only drop (at least since some update in '06) from foes that are level 17-19. They can still drop in normal mode from random monster drops that are level 20 (not from Locked Chests), but are excruciatingly rare, don't bother counting on ever getting one. A q8 max damage blue or white weapon can drop from a lot of monsters, but I don't think this is what you're looking for.

It also depends on which weapon type. [Here](http://www.guildwarsguru.com/forum/gw-gear-stat-ranges-req-t10440240.html) is a complete list of what weapons still drop) is a thread that discusses it in great length (some pictures on there are even provided by myself personally). Basically, only swords, shields and foci still drop in q8 max stats.

I'll just give you some spots where getting q8 max weapons are most likely.

* Normal mode chests in Pongmei Valley. This is also the only place in the game where you still can get q8 max Echovald/Gothic/Amber etc shields, from the chests that spawn close to the kurzick area, because those are lvl19 foes.

* q8 max **blue** swords, shields and foci still drop pretty often in Hard mode areas. The trick is getting them inscribable. I've gotten q8 max swords, shields and foci from doing DoA very often, back in the days. And they would sell for quite some money. They were rare though. Especially the swords. I would very often go around the DoA map after a run to scavenge drops, and salvage them (I made a lot of extra money doing that) for iron, granite etc, so I got a good look at all the drops, and checked requirements often. I've done over 1,000 DoA runs in my days, and I scavenged about 60-70% of them, and I've gotten 4 or 5 max damage blue swords that were inscribable. No idea how many I got that weren't. Shields and foci were more common though, I got dozens of them, and they sold for quite some money if they were tactics.

* Normal mode EotN dungeon and low level NF foes are the only places in the game that can drop gold max armor inscribable shields. They are very, very rare though. You'll more likely get q8/15 or q7/15 shields than max armor ones. Swords can also drop, but again, are super, super rare. Foci are more common, but still rare.

* Any right level foe in Factions or Prophecies can also still drop them, but again, rare as hell. If you want to ""farm"" them, normal mode Pongmei is going to be your best bet. I even think that some lvl20 foes can drop them if they're in the same zone as lower level foes. For example, Xaquang Skyway has lvl20 Jade Brotherhood, but lvl18 Vermin, and I think the Jade Brotherhood there can drop q8 max lvl weapons, but don't quote me on it, because it might be incorrect.

Hope this post helped you out a bit.

**TL;DR you can still get swords, shields and foci that are q8 max damage, but you need to look in the right place, and they're very rare**"

ricree,AskReddit,1390767007.0,"&gt; I totally believe the ""fat acceptance"" part. To much bitching, not enough trying.

Like a lot of things, ""fat acceptance"" started out with a pretty decent core concept, before promptly being ruined by bitter assholes who twisted it into something unrecognizable.

Ideally, it was supposed to simply be about reminding people that the ""people"" part of ""fat people"" was still in effect, and gaining weight didn't offer everyone a free license to heap abuse and ridicule in their direction. Should be something that doesn't need reminding, but again, a lot of people are assholes. And every now and then they need a reminder that they're still expected to show a little decency towards the rest of the world.

But, of course, there's a lot of delusional people that want to completely absolve themselves for their own mistakes, or even convince themselves that it somehow makes them superior. And that the world should bend over backwards to cater to their own self inflicted issues, no matter the cost or inconvenience. All the while sneering at people that actually manage to live a healthy lifestyle. Because same as before, some people are assholes.

itsgonnagetweird,AskReddit,1390767086.0,"As kids my cousins and I built so many things, bike jumps, rope swings, forts, and clubhouses.  Our favorite hangout soot was a creek in the neighborhood I grew up in, I bought a house in that neighborhood and our old creek is about a block away from my house.  We made sure that the paths to this place were always clear of weeds, we would spend days clearing out our area, we ripped up thorns, destroyed poison ivy, and made sure no rusty debris was in the creek itself.  Our creek had a large concrete tunnel that a small stream of water ran through, the water was always cool so we would put drinks in it to keep them cool in the summer.  

We would hunt snakes, catch crawdads, small fish, and on rare occasions catfish.  The fish we caught we would clean and cook on a fire while drinking soda and thinking we were real men.  We did a lot of living there during the summers, when we got older and started liking women in more ways than as just friends we all got curious about seeing them naked, so we did what every kid did back then, we bought porno mags from an older kid in the neighborhood.  We had a hiding spot for our nudey treasure, we would go down there and gawk at the images as a group, myself, my cousins, and sometimes some other kids from the neighborhood.

As with all things good someone had to rat us out and ruin it, we were all ratted out for looking at porn, shortly after that someone else ratted us out for smoking cigarettes and weed.  We eventually grew up and gradually abandoned our old spot, sometimes we still go back there to catch fishing bait, but after we got ratted out the good times came to a stop, we tried to hang on to the spirit of The Creek but it was never the same again.

Now we still all hang out, we live in the same neighborhood, and hopefully our kids will discover our old spot and revive the spirit of the place because it was magical."

Xnfbqnav,Minecraft,1390767267.0,"Uh, sorry for pointing out a flaw in the method used? Aside from the fact that, yes, the cobble is blurry and it needs anti-aliasing to not be blurry, that cobble, and many of the blocks in the game, only really look amazing when you're only seeing one side of it and every material forms neat little squares and rectangles. If you were to just drop a block of cobble into the world with that, it would look more like a chunk of concrete with rocks glued to it, which isn't pleasing at all. There's also the issue that Minecraft's engine can't really support textures large enough to look good with parallax mapping up close. If you look at the second picture with the closeup of the wall, sure, the ones in the shade and the ones far off look nice, but the 4 rocks closest to you in that picture are incredibly jarring. I personally feel that due to Minecraft's blocky aesthetic, 16x and 32x textures look the best, since the low resolution of the textures match the low resolution of the world, and no amount of mapping can change Minecraft's inherent blockiness."

DivineVodka,OnePiece,1390767437.0,"I am not sure where anyone got the notion from that Sanji was on Zoro's level or whatever...  The M3 has always been Luffy &gt; Zoro &gt; Sanji.  It never changed once in the series aside from earlier at Whiskey Peak where Oda said Luffy and Zoro were both 6 and Sanji was 5.  If we go off that and say Zoro and Sanji grew at the same rate but Gear 2 pushed Luffy a bit farther to not be equal with Zoro again then it would mean Luffy 7, Zoro 6 &amp; Sanji 5 correct?  Or was it up until Enies Lobby Oda said?  Oh well I can hardly remember for anyone who wants sources it was in a Databook IIRC but I am quite sure Oda did in fact say they were once equals.

If we go just off that we already know Zoro was always superior.  Unless people are going to argue Sanji use to equal Luffy in strength which nothing suggested.  So I am not sure where you are going with that OP about falling behind Sanji has always been behind Zoro and Zoro to Luffy.  In other words...  Sanji is where he's at I don't think he's weak and he has yet to show us his full strength, granted how in gods name was he even suppose to show us it when DD can outright control him like that...  I really am confused as to how Luffy will overcome that controlling thing..

As for Vergo fight...  Vergo was quite strong...  I think he would push Zoro to high diff..  So it's honestly no surprise that he beat Sanji especially considering Sanji was weakened before...  I am not sure if it justifies his legs ( his arsenal) getting broken though.

Also...  We really have no clue if Big Mom is even on the ship...  Maybe Tamago was talking over a den den mushi.  Although it would be nice if she was on the ship I just think that would be kind of lame that she got introduced now to deal with Sanji...  Look how WB was introduced?  It led to Shanks meeting him two yonkou's!  That led to the Marines getting ready for battle."

Mac Russian Red (with Pro Longwear Lipliner in Kiss Me Quick) is pretty fab. This is my trick to make ANY lipstick last: Line and fill in lips, then apply lipstick, blot gently, then take a new tissue (if two ply, pull apart so you have the one thin layer), gently lay it over your mouth, and take a transparent finishing powder and either a brush loaded with powder, or a powder puff with powder and blot your mouth with the powder through the tissue. Be sure that use a long lasting powder, and that your thoroughly powder your lips. Then remove tissue and do 1 of two things: 1: apply a very light top coat of lip product to finish the look or leave them be to turn a satin or creme lip into a matte one! This is important if your lip product isn't a matte product because at this point your satin or creme lip now looks matte, and if your lipstick is a matte finish I still apply a light top coat just to give my lips a polished look.

What else are they supposed to do with their shitty degree that they didn't earn? Most of them don't really have many other options. It's also just part of the personality that is necessary for elite athletes. 

As for the other part, I think most people view opioids differently than steroids because people use steroids to become better than they are, whereas opioids are seen to be used to just be able to continue playing. Football players who get caught using steroids get about as much shit as any other sport."

Handyland,videos,1390767536.0,"There are a number of factors at play.

First off, engine development has been pretty locked up for some years now, so all of the engines were at pretty much the same output in this video.  (Using the past tense here because they're changing to V6 turbos this year.)  However, each team for each race chooses a set of gear ratios for the car that can matter for the top end.  I'm shocked at how often, when watching cars on the Kemmel Straight at Spa, they're bouncing off the rev limiter because they need a taller 7th gear.  But anyway, ratios matter.  If you gear a car to be able to do 350kph, it'll accelerate more slowly, so don't overgear it.  This coming season, they'll only have one gear set for the entire calendar, so that's changing too.  Aero makes a difference.  Some cars generate downforce more efficiently than others; efficiency meaning with less drag as a byproduct.  Also, they choose how much wing to run on the cars at each race (and can adjust front wing angles mid-race), and generally more wing (more downforce) means more drag and slower top speeds.  Lastly, watch the on-screen graphics.  A lot of these clips are taken during overtaking maneuvers when the drivers have access to their DRS.  DRS, or Drag Reduction System, is exactly what it sounds.  It opens a flap in the rear wing that reduces drag.  During the race, it's only available for a designated section of the track, and can only be used in that section if you are within 1 second of the car in front."

duffmanhb,worldnews,1390767584.0,"I don't think it's as easy as just flipping a switch and instituting sweeping change. Nor is it easy to just pack your bags and run as you think. Do you think he's able to just pack up and move to China? He'll be deemed a traitor with a huge tag on his head, his family will be deamonized, and a new ruler will come into play. They wont be kind, especially as an honor culture. They will seek him down and kill him. And who exactly will be this replacement? What are his long term goals? Will he be able to maintain stability? If not, again, Kim is again going to be hunted down. So it's a lose lose situation for him. He has to fight rather than flight. A failing government just means likely death and certain stripping of all honor -- which is something their culture holds very very high.

The most logical action to take is to take the throne and play with the hand you've been dealt. Again, you can't just change everything over night. You have to lead and have the respect of tons of powerful people surrounding you. You have to appease your generals and elite. So while he has no good options, he does have options better than others. And that's exactly what he's doing.

It's easy as a Westerner to look in and vilify the state, understandably, but unfortunately international relations and governance isn't that simple. Context matter a whole lot. 

I'd also say look at their perspective, for all intents and purposes they feel under constant threat due to the South's strategy of hard armed escellation. Often, when the North is in trouble and needs international aid, they'll throw a hissy fit, and get aid to calm them down. But the SK president before the current had a strategy of retaliating with 2x the force, which is a horrible thing to do to a state that feels under constant threat. Their only LOGICAL move is to further escalate to show any potential threats that they aren't weak and open for a potential state taking them over. 

I think the long term plan though is for NK to open up a bit more. It wont happen over night, and will probably take literally decades, but it will slowly happen. That's why I see the whole Rodman thing as the first step to sort of open up to the West. There is a really good lecture that I can't recall who it was done by, but goes into this quite a bit. But basically, as American's we think of NKs as sort of misserable zombies that are in constant fear. But the truth is, they are still humans at the end of the day. Their government is trying to actively increase their economic output, but it's not that simple. They could in theory just institute capitalism tomorrow, which would instantly lead to the people being bombarded with information, wealth, and losing loyalty to their leadership. Again, something the elites and those in power aren't willing to give away. So what do you do? You slowly ease people into it. You make slow progressive changes over time slowly opening up their economic system.

I'm not trying to be apologetic, I'm just saying that it's not as simple of a situation as many people would like it to be."

namesaremptynoise,AskReddit,1390767621.0,"&gt;But why do people allow themselves to become addicted to drugs to the point where it ruins their lives? 

Because that's how addiction works.  You don't know it's happening until it's too late.  Or you don't care.

&gt;Why not just stop using? 

I'm not sure you understand what the word ""addiction"" means.

&gt;Why start using in the first place? Is it just peer pressure? Is it just to take the edge off your empty, pathetic life? 

Maybe any, maybe all.  People are individuals, and thinking they have boilerplate reasons for the things they do is silly.  For me it was self-destructiveness.  I was already suicidal and into self-harm before I started doing hard drugs.  I figured if I was going to destroy myself anyway I might as well have fun doing it.

&gt;95% of crime that is prosecuted in the courts is in some way related to the abuse of controlled substances.

I'd like to see where you're getting this figure.

&gt;Why is everybody so excited about legal marijuana? 

Because for a lot of people marijuana is more enjoyable than alcohol and has fewer and milder side-effects.

&gt;What's so great about it that it has become this major component of your life and your character?

There you go with being overly-simplistic again.  Not everybody who smokes pot is the dumbass stoner you see on the movies or have to deal with at McDonalds.  Pot-smokers can be found from wall street traders to chefs to musicians, to doctors, to pretty much any other subset you want to try to divide people into that isn't based on ""does/does not use drugs.""  

&gt;I've never used an illegal drug in my life. 

That's nice.  I've tried most of the drugs you've ever heard about and seriously, when you class pot-smokers with heroin junkies it makes you sound like a 12 year old who just got out of DARE class.  

&gt;I've drank alcohol maybe three or four times in my life. I never use caffeine. I seem to be able to function just fine without these things, so i wonder why are so many people dependent on them.

Enjoying a thing doesn't mean being dependent on it.  Yes, plenty of people are dependent on caffiene to some level, but plenty others aren't.  Lots of people enjoy alcohol without becoming alcoholics, plenty of people can smoke pot without turning into dreadlocked losers.  It depends on a combination of factors from the drug itself (hallucinogens are generally not considered/shown to be addictive beyond the basic psychological component, caffiene and alcohol are moreso, nicotine, opiates and meth sink their hooks into you in a serious way), to the individual's personality to what their life is like.

Also, just FYI, people can be worthless criminal shitbags without ever touching drugs, and I've known people who've done every nasty drug you've ever heard of and never broke any other law."

Sahasrahla,eu4,1390767638.0,"When I played as Ming one thing I found useful was to vassalize Manchu. Before dealing with anyone else I took their provinces (didn't core them) until I could force vassalization and then I sold their provinces back to them for free. Early game they had much better units so having their help on the mainland was quite useful. 

Other than that, I'd suggest not trying to expand on too many fronts at once. Tibet won't bother you and you can expand diplomatically (but slowly) in south-east Asia by diplo-vassalizing some of the poorer nations there. Royal marriages with the Horde and Korea should help keep them off your back and perhaps give you an opportunity to claim their thrones later. 

This leaves Japan as a natural place to expand after you subjugate Manchu. One strategy that can be useful there is to wait for Japan to unite and get cores everywhere then force them to release nations and return territory until they're small enough to vassalize. Then you can go to war for them to make all those released nations return territory to your now vassal Japan. 

At first you'll have problems with weaker units (especially when fighting Manchu) so don't be afraid to go over your force limits and put most of your army together. You need to win with superior numbers. Throw your armies against them and then hire mercenaries when your manpower's depleted. Make sure to keep the correct faction in charge to help your military strength and this should go alright. "

argleblather,needadvice,1390767649.0,"My husband and I just purchased our first home, and we did go through a first time homebuyer's course, which was quite helpful. Our process went remarkably smoothly for us, we took the homebuyer course in September, and we've been in our new home for about two months now, closed the week before Thanksgiving (here in the US.) This was our process. 

* Set aside 20 minutes a night to check in on the process, discuss budget and timelines, or to clean out and pack up a closet. Getting rid of things as we went made the move very smooth. 

* Looked into any possible assistance programs we might qualify for. (For us there weren't any, our income for our area is too high, and we're not living rurally, but there may be government or other down payment assistance programs you qualify for.) 

*  Called a few banks/lenders to get an idea for what our maximum loan might be, and then knocked that down by about $20k, to where we're comfortable with our monthly payments. 

* For us it was helpful for us each to make a list of our ""must haves,"" our ""negotiable wants"" and ""must not haves"" for a home/neighborhood, and then we sat down together to get on the same page for what we were looking for. Working these two out made the purchasing part much less stressful because we knew what we really wanted in a home, and how much we were comfortable paying. Staying within those boundaries meant that we're happy with our purchase without fretting over whether or not we could have saved $2 a month. Our initial offer took $3k off the asking price and was rejected, but we got $2500 at closing and some appliances so it balanced out. 

* Everything is negotiable! We closed with the seller paying closing costs for us, and including all appliances (except for washer/dryer, which we already had) which saved us enough money to pay for our new furniture at closing. Anything physically installed/attached to the property should be considered ""real estate"" and be included, but things that can be easily moved are the seller's property. That doesn't mean you can't ask them to leave them. 

* Depending on Canadian mortgage lenders, you may have to carry mortgage insurance if your down payment is less than 20%. In some cases you can pay this all as a lump sum, rather than parceling it out for 30 years for much cheaper than drawing out payments. If you can get the seller to cover some closing costs for you, this is a pretty good way to go. 

* Try to be present when the home inspection is performed, so that you can see what the inspector sees. Our realtor had some good recommendations for people she likes to work with, and was good about giving us feedback on the people who may miss things. I think our inspection was very thorough and overall pretty clean. The inspector may have suggestions for things you would like/need fixed before taking possession of the property, and may also be a good resource for routine maintenance that should be performed as well. 

* Think about how you live as a family. If you gather a lot together in the kitchen around meals, a galley kitchen will probably not work for you. In our house, we tend to like our own private spaces, and chose a home that lets us each have our quiet corners, with enough room to entertain when we want. 

* No home is going to be perfect. Know ahead of time if you're the type to jump into renovations with both feet, or if you're going to be happier in a finished home. The finished home will cost you more up front, a reno means living in a construction zone for a while. The family we bought our house from were very excited to move into their 100 year old farmhouse and start tearing it down to the studs and make it their own. I wanted a place I could settle into right away and not need to do anything but paint. :)

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1390767892.0,"&gt; We can ALL be monsters, you know. In our deep, dark, selfish human hearts.

&gt; As angry as you might be, or bitter about the way relationships have treated both genders....it doesn't change the fact that we're all....just human.

I agree OP. You sound like a nice person (well, I don't *really* know, but whatever), so I personally would like it if you didn't have to let your experience in these discussions change your behaviour too much. If you forgot all of this, it probably wouldn't affect your life too much, just as the top comments as well as you yourself believe. (Or, if you want, just take what you can learn to quietly avoid being manipulated by people. That's the nice thing about open information.)

If you want an understanding of this anger or bitterness, I think /u/sh1v's comment in this thread is good.

If you or others don't understand, I think I can offer a perspective that might be easier to relate to, especially for liberal minds since I had one myself and still do to a more moderate extent. 

I don't have any misgivings towards women... at all. I just didn't have many bad experiences with them, except my mother.

But I've felt deep level of bitterness and anger throughout my life that has driven me to irrationality, depression, and near suicide several times, and the experience gave me unforgettable empathy with much in the manosphere. 

Two things to address here: One is an example of the cause of this anger. The other is a description of my state of mind.

For causes, one of them came from my financial situation.

My liberal beliefs and expectations of reality, like ""fairness"" and ""equal opportunity"", were constantly being reinforced by mores and propaganda (not just from those around me but society itself), but constantly being shattered. 

*""Those fucking big bosses. Making money in 40 hours a week what it takes hundreds of hours from poorer people to make. What gives?""*

*""There is literally* nothing *I can do more! Why is my life so shitty?""*

*""Why did* he *get accepted to that university and I didn't?""*

It was a series of built expectations shattered and subsequent feelings of betrayal from childhood onward. These went away with the realization of the transactional and pragmatic nature of our society as well understanding the philosophical conflicts between myself and others.

As for the second point, my state of mind, it was admittedly irrational. I do think a lot of people in the manosphere are angry and irrational. The level of hatred some people (including myself) can feel when they are depressed or even suicidal might be difficult for some people to imagine when they haven't experienced it themselves. I don't mean to be presumptuous, but the constant shock and awe I hear from people over some angry internet comments is anecdata enough for me.

I didn't hate women specifically, but I hated everyone. I just wanted everyone to die and the world to blow up for putting me in that situation. I hated the pressures everyone put me through. I hated everyone else for seemingly having more ""privilege"" than me. Most of all, I hated myself (kind of like how rpers have such loathing for ""betas"", as part of it is self-loathing). I even hated how hateful I was and for having these guilt-inducing thoughts. 

Your words are comforting to me now, and I can like you for them, but I'm not sure they would have reached me back then in that state of mind, especially when many of the ideas you're espousing now coincide thematically with the pretty lies I had been fed throughout my life. It would have taken a dramatic philosophical shift, which is partially why I understand a lot of rpers encourage such an extreme swing.

I personally would prefer they just find a consistent set of faiths similar to my own, but I doubt the effectiveness of proselytizing. What can you do really but give the most positive advice you think you can offer to people who may need it?"

It's a physical difference between male and female bodies. There's a proven link between genetics and all aspects of brain and body development.

But then again, seeing how they ruined Fractals with their 'revamp', I hardly suspect anything good coming from Anet end-game wise anyway.

However, losing weight does reduce your risk of developing some cancers so doing keto, or any other weight loss regime, successfully will be preventative and reduce an individuals risk.

Her sons are in their 30's now and she is still getting her paychecks garnished.

Loplop509,videos,1390768363.0,"It's not as simple as that.

In ELI5 terms, the capacity of the engine is the one to pay more attention to. A 2.0 V6 will often make the same amount of power as a 2.0 I4 or V8. Of course, that isn't entirely true as different engine configurations will lend themselves better to higher RPMs (more BHP) or longer stroke (more torque). But there are, again, variations on that.

The engines themselves this year will probably be around 80 - 100bhp down from last year, but as mentioned the new ERS system - the KERS replacement - produces more power than last year for longer per lap. 

A lot of people appear to be overlooking the tyres however. Pirelli have stated they're going to make - by popular demand/pressure - more durable compounds, meaning softer (faster) tyres will last longer and thus drivers will be able to - in theory - push hard on them."

iamtryingtobegood,TrollXChromosomes,1390768782.0,"Hi, I'm responding to your first comment because I hope other people will see it. So there's a difference between constructive criticism and merely critical comments, and there's also a difference between solicited and unsolicited feedback. 

When a girl posts a picture of her makeup on /r/MUA she is asking for/soliciting constructive criticism, which aren't just any old opinion. Here is an example of good constructive criticism.

*  your eyebrows are done really thickly and appears somewhat jarring against your facial structure. was it your intention to achieve such a dramatic look? perhaps drawing them differently might flatter your face more or be more appropriate for an everyday look.

Note that it states a more or less neutral observation, is specific, takes into account the intentions of the woman, and makes a polite suggestion accordingly. This is useful feedback because she learns more about how her makeup looks to other people (e.g., she might have noticed something was off, but didn't realize it was the angle of her brow), and how to modify it if she so chooses. Often you will see posts asking specifically for advice on one part of the face, and this is why.

She is not soliciting any of the following:

* Comments on her overall sexual attractiveness that present no specific commentary or relation to her makeup, e.g. ""you're hot"" ""i'd tap that""
* Opinions that disregard her intentions in wearing makeup or a specific style of makeup, e.g. ""you look better without makeup"" or ""bright red lipstick is unnatural and gross""
* Opinions about makeup generally ""women shouldn't wear makeup"" ""makeup is bad for you"" - however well-intentioned, this is not the space to break out a philosophical discussion of this sort. Of course, it would be very different to say, ""Hey, I've used that brand of foundation and I've read that it's really terrible for your skin because it contains XYZ chemicals, here's a link to more information""

So those comments are unnecessary, irrelevant, and usually rude. I suppose those are what you meant by ""criticism."" The thing with criticism is that it's always situational: at work, I should expect criticism from my boss if I am a sloppy employee; at school, I should expect criticism if I'm always late, since part of my job as a student is to be on time. Similarly, critical feedback can also be rude if it's not solicited - I would expect critical feedback from my bosses and professors on my work, but it would be rude of them to comment on my appearance or give appearance-based ""compliments"" (unless I am dressing in really unprofessional way and then professionalism is the issue). 

r/Makeupaddiction is a space in which women go to seek constructive criticism on their makeup, not general opinions (critical or laudatory) on their appearance and/or their choice to wear makeup. When people say things like ""you look better without makeup,"" first of all it's ridiculous because they're probably looking at a photo with makeup, and second of all even if they did in fact prefer the person without makeup, it's still rude becauuse it implies that the woman's choices regarding her appearance are made according to the standards of what men (or that particular man) prefers, not because she wants to try out a new look, to change how she looks, to wear crazy colors that she can't wear everyday, to feel sexy and confident, to impress somebody other than the commentor, to imitate a look from a particular time period or style, to make herself look more energetic and young, to look ""better"" by her own standards, or simply to play with makeup. Those are all reasons women wear makeup. To reduce that to the suggestion that she just wants to look better (in your opinion) is ridiculous.

audreyshake,IAmA,1390768790.0,"You are apologizing and expressing sympathy for rapists by insisting that theyâre just like the rest of humanity, which they simply arenât; most of humanity hasnât raped, and the larger part of humanity would never rape no matter the circumstances. That alone is the difference; rapists *are* humanâobviouslyâand *do* share many things in common with everyone. What they donât have in common with everyone else is having raped another, or being so deficient in decency as to be able to contemplate such an invasive, senseless act.

I know what the fundamental attribution error is, but it would appear that you do not. To quote the linked page:

&gt; When people judge their own behavior, and they are the actor, they are more likely to attribute their actions to the particular situation than to a generalization about their personality. Yet when an observer is explaining the behavior of another person (the actor), they are more likely to attribute this behavior to the actorsâs overall disposition rather than to situational factors. This frequent error shows the bias that people hold in their evaluations of behavior.Â¹

Your reliance on it is inapposite here as Iâm not attributing a similar action differently between myself and another. It would be appropriate if I had forced someone to have sex with me (or coerced any similar intimate physical interaction) and refused to accept blame for it while simultaneously attributing similar actions of others to their character. For example, if I came here and said something like this:

&gt; I once had rough sex with a date. She said she didnât want to eat me, but she was kissing me so sensually and stroking my hair, and I just couldnât help it. I playfully wrestled her onto her back, stuck my fingers in her hair, and rode her like Iâd been dreaming about. She kept telling me to stop and that she didnât like it, but I made her finish me. I felt pretty bad afterwards and apologizedâIâm no rapistâbut I just got caught up in the moment. I offered to return the favor, but she left pretty quick. Other than that, we had a great time and I think we really connected. Can anyone relate?

while also saying stuff like this:

&gt; Human nature might be universal, but many of us would never rape another, even under the most extraordinary of circumstances. Those who would and have are an other, and do lack at least that particular aspect of basic human decency by virtue of having committed such a crime.

then I would be making that mistake. But I didnât: Iâve never pressured or tried to pressure anyone into intimate contact with me; if I did, I would be a rapist; I would obviously be lacking in basic human decency; and I would relieve the world of the burden of my existence.

I never said you dismissed rape victims; on the contrary, neither of us said anything about them, and I donât think thereâs any reason to bring them into this now except, of course, to paint me as saying something silly that I never said.

You might feel that you can relate to rapists, but thatâs your problem and if you choose to act on it I hope you meet a Louise. Anyway, wouldnât you be happier complaining about how misunderstood and maligned rapists are over in /r/MensRights or one of the PUA subs and not in a thread about young children being raped?

What about those quotes suggests to you that redpillschool is not defending the idea that a husband should be able to have sex with his wife whenever he wants regardless of her wishes?

I find it really interesting how incredibly tenacious you are about trying to defend this particular point while steadfastly ignoring all the other links I posted. Can't make any defense for those ones, eh?

Edit: Ah, so you're also claiming that

&gt;One might have more sympathy for the âdate rape victimsâ if they wanted the men to marry them, feared they were ruined for other suitors, and were prepared to assume their own obligations as wives and mothers. But this is simply not the case. The date rape campaigners, if not the confused young women themselves, are hostile to the very idea of matrimony, and never propose it as a solution. They want to jail men, not make responsible husbands of them. This is far worse than shotgun marriage, which at least allowed the man to act as father to the child he had sired...The date rape issue can be solved overnight by restoring shotgun marriageâbut with the shotgun at the womanâs back. The âvictimâ should be told to get into the kitchen and fix supper for her new lord and master.

 is not in any way actually saying that rape victims should be forced to marry their rapists. Interesting. Do you also believe that 

&gt;after the birth of her child, the woman will have more important things to worry about than whether the act by which she conceived it accorded with some womenâs studies professorâs newfangled notion of âtrue consent.â 

and that

&gt;Feminists understand rape, however, not as a violation of a womanâs chastity or marital fidelity, but of her merely personal wishes... it would be better to ask how it could be taken seriously at all once we begin defining it as they do. (i.e. as a man forcing a woman into sex against her will regardless of her marital status.)

Do you believe these things, and are you going to defend them? Also, allow me to point out once again that this ""Sexual Utopia"" that I have just quoted and that you are defending is a legitimate white supremacist manifesto, originally published in a white supremacist magazine. Are you going to defend that as well, and the legitimacy of the ideas of the kind of people who post a white supremacist manifesto as ""required reading"" in their sidebar?"

Content is indeed the most important part about a guide, but it still needs to flow logically and be easy to read.

I agree that there are a disproportionate amount of poor builds and guides to good ones on Smitefire. The main reason for this, I think, is that, unlike Tiermonster, there is no review process before a guide is published. We strictly rely on people commenting and downvoting the poor guides, and unfortunately many people can't even bring themselves to perform one clicking motion.


I think both Tiermonster and Smitefire are great sites. Tiermonster, in my opinion, is more up-to-date and reliable due to the previously mentioned review system. Smitefire, on the other hand, is an excellent site if you really put forth the effort into making a great guide. The reason I haven't published any guides for Tiermonster is because it's little more than a word document. They both serve their roles well, and they also both have plenty of room for improvement."

&gt;We encourage free speech and defend everyone's right to express unpopular points of view. But we don't permit hate speech (speech which attacks or demeans a group based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, and sexual orientation/gender identity).

So, Youtube couldn't claim they're doing everything they can to remove holocaust denialism videos because the rule says they'll leave them up as long as they don't use hate speech. I can't find Facebook's policy on what they will remove and what they won't, so I can't address them. But, if they were to ban reddit because of holocaust denialism, they'd have to ban Youtube as well, and Facebook, if their policy is similar to Youtube's. They wouldn't ban reddit, though, because it'd be obvious that the main function of the site isn't holocaust denialism and there is only a tiny group that does it."

basically, children are forced into learning and good grades are emphasized more than actually learning, so much that by high school, most kids are averse to actually going to school. When I had to go to that high school where i took the Intro to Humanities course, i had to write an essay on why I should be accepted and I wrote about how while other kids were just going to school because they had to, I was one of the few in my middle school who actually wanted to go to school and learn.

We also watched a TED talk video about this Indian guy who put computers up in impoverished areas and the kids actually learned on their own just from googling and searching the internet. Another thing we did was look at the educational standards and practices of each of the highest ranking countries in education (Canada, South Korea, Finland, etc.) and discussed why they had the top spots on the list."

I_Are_Brown_Bear,AskReddit,1390768993.0,"I am a career camp counselor.  Camp, working with kids, and recreation are my life and it is what I want to do as my career.

When I was working at a Y summer camp in Minnesota, I had a cabin of ~8 year old boys.  Each session is a week long and so amazing.  Anyway, one of my boys had a loose tooth and was playing with it all week.  Two days before the end of the session, he loses the tooth.  I sent him the the nurse, we put it in a pouch, the whole nine.  All the boys still believed in the tooth fairy at their age and I heard them saying that the tooth fairy wouldn't come because he was at camp.  There was a pretty good split between them.  Some of the boys thought the tooth fairy only came to your home and some said she'd travel to your toothy needs.  I went over and convinced him to put it under his pillow that night.

When they were all asleep I crept over to his bunk (he was on the top bunk, not easy to sneak up there) and carefully nabbed the tooth and replaced it with a dollar.

The next morning he was ecstatic and all the boys were amazed.

When the session ended and the parents were coming for all the kids, I went up to his father, pulled him aside and explained everything.  I handed him the spoils of my toothy excapade.  He genuinely thanked me and tried to repay the dollar, but I politely refused.  This is why I love camp."

As for the physics, you're seeing this video as a bunch of cars driving around a circuit.  Since you don't understand the limits of the cars, it's not exciting.  For people who watch F1, we know that if any of the drivers in that video tried to drive *slightly* faster, they'd spear off the road into a wall at immense speed.

The branch I want to air layer (the new tree) is too big to be bonsai, so after the roots are established, I would do a trunk chop of the new tree (air layered off branch).

Instead of air layering the branch, and then trunk chopping it, I figured, why not cut the branch where I would trunk chop it later (after I air layered it, and it's now a new tree). I figure then that ""trunk"" chop (while branch is still on the tree) would get nutrients from the larger tree, instead of being air layered and THEN trunk chopped.

Abortion was never a religious obligation, done purely for the enjoyment of others.

noc007,politics,1390769310.0,"The US is getting EMV; no need to campaign for it. October 2015 is the deadline for all US merchants to have EMV capable terminals mandated by IIRC three of the four major networks (Visa, MC, Disc, Amex).

The Target breach isn't that big of a problem for card holders. Walking into a merchant and swiping a card to buying something doesn't give them your address, other personal information, and SSN. You're more likely to get your identity stolen from a doctor's office or bank records. If the card number is stolen, the bank invalidates it and sends you a new one. One should never process the transaction as debit and use a PIN; always process as credit because of the liability.

The thing is with EMV the liability for fraud is going to move back to the card holder because they will claim EMV is completely secure and the only way for fraud is if you give out your PIN. This is wrong, terminals have been compromised over the years to capture this data and the card holder has to either lose the money or fight it hard."

Sornos,DaystromInstitute,1390769318.0,"I think the biggest argument against Dougherty being a S31 agent is that the entire Ba'Ku relocation plan was needlessly complicated and on a whole totally incompetent. It reeks of compromise and half-measures, two things that Section 31 has no room for.

If S31 truly wanted the metaphasic particles, they'd have stolen the collector technology from the Son'a and poisoned the atmosphere of the Ba'ku planet. The Federation can swoop in with their newly ""discovered"" collector technology, save the Ba'ku from certain death by a bizarre and sudden environmental collapse, and then recover the life saving radiation of the planet.

TofuRobber,writing,1390769346.0,"Zombies aren't scary because we don't know how to kill them. We know how to kill a bear but a bear is still scary. Zombies are scary because they we don't know how to stop them from existing or to reverse it. 

That's isn't exactly what I was proposing either. I'm saying that the use of zombies are a reflection of society. We no longer hold unfounded fears of monsters or vampires because we know they don't exist. We however still fear microbiological threats such as pathogens or viruses. Zombies just happens to be the way that that fear is represented.

Vampires, werewolfs, King Kong, ghosts, monsters; These were all classic horror stories because they represent what lurked in the unknown. Then you start to see pop culture move to things like Frankenstein's monster, robots, aliens, and zombies. These things represent society's fear in science (have we gone too far), technology (will we create our own destruction), space (is there life out there and are they peaceful), and microorganisms that are all around us that we fight everyday.

But just because these things can be scary doesn't mean they have to as you pointed out. The Walking Dead isn't about zombies. Zombies are used the plot medium but it's always been about the human relationships and interaction. You can replace zombies with mindless monsters, or aliens, or any other threat and the story could possible continue as it is but zombies were used because it's relevant to contemporary society."

bunker_man,Christianity,1390769384.0,"&gt; Well, I think church attendance is meaningless if it's not voluntary. 

This is kind of true. But I suppose some people literally think that forcing brainwashing on the unwilling is for the best. 

&gt;That being said, I'm sure your dad has your best interests at heart. I'm not sure how old you are, but years from now, I believe you'll look back on this time and be glad if you respond to your dad in a respectful manner, recognizing that this is his way of showing love for you and God.

There's literally no evidence for this at all. Complying with parents making questionable demands isn't strengthening any bonds. The only reason at all people look back on it with more sympathy is that many of them once they become adults are now more sympathetic to the adult side than the kid side and now have authoritarian strains themself. This is not something it's good to encourage.

&gt; if you choose to resent your dad for forcing you to attend church, I believe you'll look back on this time and feel pretty sorry about the way you acted.

Obviously resenting is not good, but that's a totally different issue from the fact that he has real wants that his dad is interfering with. Hating the person is different from overcoming the obstacle."

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1390769458.0,"I was just researching this subject a few days ago for unrelated reasons. The truth is, there are many lawyers who will try to drag out the divorce as much as possible, but they aren't as common as you'd think. Most of the dragging out is done by one party trying to bleed out the other party. Often times they'll fight over stupid things like some souvenirs they got when travelling Europe. Often the lawyer will have to pull their client aside and ask, ""Listen, you are paying me 500 dollars an hour. Are these souvenirs worth 500 dollars? And if they are, you know they other person is just going to match you at something else worth 500 dollars. Financially the best option is to just let them have it, and pay 100 dollars and buy them online if you must. You're wasting time with me.""

Usually this breaks down into 2 categories:  

The first is that the person that gives in trying to be financially smart, ends up continually getting shafted over these nickle-and-dime issues, so eventually they'll put their foot down and stop allowing them to take all the things of personal value to make a point. Then this just spirals into a an expensive fight of pride while they fight over a 50 dollar knife set. Interestingly enough, the lawyers are always paid by the breadwinner which is usually the guy. And these costs don't come out of the 50/50 split, so it's basically him paying for the lawyers. So when a women get's into a pride fight, there is usually a point where the man has to either just give up to save as much money as possible, or go for method 2.

This method generally comes from the guy. He's pissed that he's giving up half his wealth to this chick so instead of just making a clean split, he'll drag this issue into the ground because he much rather give the money to his lawyers than let her have it.

At the end of the day, the high costs usually come from resentful parties fighting over petty shit and/or trying to bleed the other one -- not the lawyers themselves.  "

If the rest of your body is capable of switching from glucose to ketone body metabolism, then why wouldn't the cancer cells be? In the same way that cells in the rest of your body survive on ketones, so too can cancer cells. In fact, one small lab study suggests that ketones could worsen clinical outcomes by fueling the growth of the cancer. I would need to see some pretty strong evidence before I'm swayed either way.

However, losing weight does reduce your risk of developing some cancers so doing keto, or any other weight loss regime, successfully will be preventative and reduce an individuals risk.

Think of  modern comedians like Jon Stewart or Louis C.K. They are constantly putting themselves down because without that it would place the focus on us, the viewer. Humor is a tool to communicate thoughts that otherwise wouldn't be discussed because they are prefaced with a ""I'm a clown, don't take this too seriously""

The nature of humor fits in perfectly with masculinity in the modern age, all sitcoms, all comedians, all blockbuster films are based upon making fun of male losers, virgins, socially awkward geeks, etc etc etc. 

Furthermore because men feel they aren't allowed to talk about their problems (man up culture) the only outlet that is socially acceptable is humor.

Max_Insanity,whowouldwin,1390769622.0,"I have re-read the HP series lately and I think Katniss has no chance. Here are some spell Hermione knows (or should know) which would help her.:

- Expelliarmus (Disarm)
- Protego (Instant physical barrier)
- Impedimenta (Slows down objects/people)
- Muffliato (Creates buzzing noise in the ears of anyone in the area)
- Petrificus totalus (Petrifies)
- Reducto/Expulso (Blasts things away)
- Stupefy (Stuns)
- Bubble head charm (Breathe under water)
- Levicorpus (Makes a person levitate)
- Episkey (Heals wounds)
- Accio (to charm the enemies weapon to herself)

and most important of all:

- Homenum revelio (Reveals humans near the caster) and the Disillusionment charm (makes you nearly invisible) &lt;- In combination with apparition, she would find Katniss in no time, use one of the many above mentioned spells (probably protego first to protect herself, then accio to get the bow) and Katniss has nothing left to protect herself with. She literally didn't even see her coming.

and, if shit really hits the fans, she can take the enemy with her by using fiendfyre, which she admitted she could do, but didn't dare try because it gets out of control so easily. Would destroy the whole arena (possibly the whole country, I don't know how long it keeps going)

Honorable mention:

- Impervius. This spell repels things, but it is never said how much it repels, it might save her from the arrows.
- Repello Muggletum. &lt;- If everything else fails and she can't find her enemy in a moments notice, this will keep her protected over the night, so she can keep looking the following day."

Ekotar,malefashionadvice,1390769720.0,"So I like the idea of clothing that evolves with you: veg tan leather, raw denim, oxfords that slowly fray in the collar, stuff like that. I really like the idea of natural CXL for that reason, and the only boots that I like the last and details of with natural CXL are the trenches and these [Aldens](http://www.theshoemart.com/alden-mens_45625h_natural_chrome_excel/pvc-ald-mxsb-45625h_ald_m_45625h.html#full_prod_info).

I like, besides the richness of color of certain specific leathers, ie the Cherry CXL OSB used in their SF exclusive trail oxfords last year, and cordovan. . . I know it's not really in the design of many casual boots, but I like the sheen, color depth, and thickness in certain cuts of CXL and cordovan, and how they evolve.

As far as soles, I'd prefer a lower profile sole, both for looks and because I like in NorCal, I'm pretty far from any serious rain/snow/slush, although it does shower here lightly a fair bit."

sambuca66,depression,1390769722.0,"When I think about killing myself or I start fixating on the negative aspects of my life I make lists. I know it seems silly and maybe a little juvenile but it really helps me calm down.

First I make a list of everyone I love in the world. My parents, my sister, my friends, etc.

Then I list everything I love in the world. Music, naps in the grass, caramel frappuccinos, puppies, etc.

Finally, I make a list of all the things I want to do. Travel to Italy, cliff jump, run a marathon, etc.

I'm sure that this is all not life is for you. If you sit back and you really reflect on the positive aspects of your life you might be able to pull yourself out of this rut.

I don't care if your list has 3 things on it. Hell even 1 thing. Its something.

It can be as silly as food. If you kill yourself you will never ever get to eat a piece of chocolate cake again. You'll never see another sunset or make someone laugh. No more music, no more backrubs, and youll never pet another puppy again. There is always the potential for things to get better if you tough it out for long enough.

TheFlamingOne,pokemon,1390769784.0,"However, you actually cant do that as a company. If I were to compare it to another case like it, take Watch Dogs. They did a wonderful job delaying their game because they were afraid of the quality of the game. They reported that to the people that were eagerly waiting for the game. 

Now Nintendo pulled Pokemon Bank because their servers weren't up for the job. THAT'S FINE. We can understand that to a degree. However, they should at that point make it somewhat of a priority to get it online ASAP. This is because them waiting to release it does multiple things to the company. It 

A: Cuts their revenue made from the subscription fees required for pokemon bank, 

B: Hurts their reputation (the please understand meme actually explains this quite well)

So one could argue that the revenue made off of Pokemon Bank isn't that big of a deal because it's a yearly fee, and that it's only like 5 dollars. This would be true except for the fact that even though it is a yearly fee, we won't be paying every 12 months, but every new year's for example. Let's say we get Pokemon Bank today, we get a free trial period of 1 month, meaning we are looking to purchase a subscription somewhere near the end of February. This means we'll most likely get 10 months of Bank before having to buy another year. This means every day that's passed increases their revenue ever so slightly.

Second their reputation is hurting. You can already see it by the fact that comments like the one under the picture are still appearing and being posted on Reddit. I for one did lose a bit of confidence in Nintendo. Not because of the Pokemon Bank incident as a whole, but more the lack of proper communication that we've seen from them. If you take a look at another big company in the gaming industry, Riot Games, you'll see that even though they can fail at communicating pretty badly (which came to an all-time high during frequent server outages in Europe) they recognized this issue and aimed to fix it. Instead Nintendo took over 3 weeks until after they were SUPPOSED to deliver a product to give us no real info on how the situation changed from day 1 of the delay and the moment they gave us ""additional info"". They are continuing on this path of no communication which is why they might lose customers in the long run. 

tl;dr Nintendo is bad at communication and should feel bad"

ricree,AskReddit,1390769927.0,"One thing that I think we need is a ""sexual misdemeanor"" category.

To piggyback off your examples, the 18 yo and 17yo should be ok and completely decriminalized, but a 20yo and his 15yo girlfriend is *not* acceptable, and I think it's totally reasonable for society to say ""we are not ok with that"". But on the other hand, that doesn't mean we should be saying ""oh, and by the way, your life is effectively over. have fun ever trying to gain meaningful employment ever again""

There needs to be some way to, in effect, say ""this isn't something we consider acceptable, and there will be consequences. Learn from them, before things start to get serious.""

It's a trend that's visible in society as a whole, these sorts of all or nothing penalties where lives get destroyed in the name of being tough on crime, without any sense of proportion. Three strikes laws being arguably the most famous example, followed shortly by drug laws. But sexual laws seem to be one of the biggest areas these are applied. 

There's talk every now and then about exceptions. ""Romeo and Juliet"" amendments to decriminalize people close in age, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone address the border cases. Areas where the behavior probably is in the wrong, but is also far outside the sorts of predators the laws were designed to combat."

In fact it was the time that I thought I'd booked a flight to Boston, Massachusetts but had in fact, like a real plum, booked a flight to Bangor, Maine. When I went to the Nashville airport to book in, I went up to the counter and expected to be told I'm going to Boston. In fact I said ""I'll be travelling to Boston"". The lady looked at me as if I'd had a few too many breakfast brandies and said ""Honey, you're going to Bangor, Maine. Not Boston, Massachusetts"". I had one of those ""Oh, I really am a dodo"" moments. 

So instead of going to MA, ME or anywhere, I jumped back in my ride and went back to the Mellow Mushroom in Franklin, Tennessee. 

I am silly sausage. But I won't let that put a crimp on my plans to come there this summer.

I have literally never used a firewall for over a decade and while I have gotten 1 or 2 viruses from bad torrents, I can safely say those infections were entirely my fault for making a bad decision and in no way did the viruses sneak in undetected.

Someone from Alaska can play an EP from some of my local songwriter friends in Austin if they want, resulting in a tiny payout for them. I doubt any Alaskan radio is playing them, or even much Austin radio for that matter.


I don't think spotify is the murderer people make it out to be, I think this is just overall the way that a lot of creative type careers are changing. Crowd sourcing, live shows, licensing is going to be how you make your cash going forward. It's not necessarily worse, but it is fundamentally different. You just can't go back to making big bucks off of recordings alone when its so accessible and so cheap the world over, that cat is out of the bag.

I.e. if men were allowed to rape their wives legally, marriage, in his mind, would be restored to validity. And he says that he thinks that the marriage contract IS a form of permanent consent and that a married woman should be prohibited from ever saying no to sex on that basis. And that women should not get married if they aren't cool with ""submitting"" to spousal rape. The fact that this is not how it currently works is WHY he thinks marriage is doomed.

Lets say someone forced them to eat something they hate. Based on how we view eating currently, we may only see the person who forces another to eat something they hate as being a dick and while the victim in this case does feel bad, they would get over the act itself  relatively quickly in many cases. But if we were taught that what we eat is extremely important on many levels then that same experience may be extremely traumatizing for the victim.

Now that I think about it, overrated is an odd term to use. The more I think about it, the more I think that you just don't like anime, and just because you don't agree on the same terms with other people, it doesn't mean that something is overrated. We like anime for a damn reason. It's because most of us simply enjoy the story, art, animation, and characters seen in anime. Some shows are overrated in the minds of others solely because it was one of their first anime, and because of that, they have a memory of it being better than it actually was (I realized this when I decided to rewatch some anime that I used to watch; in short they were more terrible than I remembered). Some anime, like Sword Art Online, SEEM to be overrated... but is it really? No. Not for the same reason at least. SAO, in my opinion has reached a large fan-base by appealing to people more susceptible to ""cheap tricks"" (I allow the cheap tricks keeping me interested only if they work on me because kudos to them for succeeding. After watching days worth of anime, it helps one spot the flaws that most people seem to not notice). 

Call anime idiotic if you wish, but overrated? That's debatable because overrated means that something was given more credit than it should receive... but who decides how much credit something should receive? If it went by your standards, then by all means, do call it overrated.

I love anime. Maybe I don't appreciate anime as much as others do, but I am surely a fan of it. 

Peace."

You said you made it in this very thread. You didn't make it. It's in the content library. Don't ever do this again. /u/Attempt12 is right about this low poly trend. Minimal effort into the hobby. Here is a challenge. A modeling challenge. Spend several dozen hours building a model. A vehicle, an environment piece, a series of props, etc. Whatever theme you find fun. No textures or color. Just model model model model. Focus on the details. Mimic reality first! Something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/aEw4aBy.jpg). Here is the smoothed model without wireframe: [link](http://i.imgur.com/Xa1y6gq.jpg) [More.](http://i.imgur.com/vslMSox.jpg) [More.](http://i.imgur.com/5OHk0L3.jpg) [More.](http://i.imgur.com/cD4kgAr.jpg)

Here is an airplane I did 7 or 8 years ago. It has it's problems as I was still learning how to model efficiently at the time, but the details more than make up for the imperfections in geometry.

I actually had to cut out many of the details in order to render this model at the time, but notice some of the other subtleties, such as the weight of the plane compressing the tire rubber just a bit against the runway. If I were to push this further, I'd ding it up a bit, add some grime, scrapes and other such details. 

 Early 2000's hardware was not kind with high poly rendering. The prop engines alone were nearly 1,000,000 polygons. The body shot that number into a range of 3-4 mil. These days this would not be a problem. Most of the objects are modeled to smooth. This is important.

JackPAnderson,IAmA,1390770554.0,"&gt;My question is how can a man be forcibly raped by a woman? I hate to think how this question must sound, but I can't seem to find a better way to articulate it. Outside of variables such as drugs, physical impairment, blackmail etc, what puts a man at risk of being raped by a woman? 
 
This is basically the same as ""how does a man rape a woman? If memory serves, we're only about 25% stronger than they are. I would think that it would be really hard for a man to stick a fragile part of his anatomy into a small hole that isn't conveniently located, while the woman is struggling with full force. In the end, she might make the mental calculation to stop fighting so she doesn't suffer any more physical violence against her, after all, her attacker could probably severely hurt or even kill her. I wouldn't blame her for picking the least horrific option. 

But more likely, she's trashed. So drunk that she can't fight back with full force. In most date rapes, and most rapes are date rapes, either the victim, the attacker, or both, are intoxicated. 

So don't ignore the whole ""incapacitated with chemicals"" angle, because it's a big risk factor in male on female rape, too. "

Iamyourbetter,AskHistorians,1390770722.0,"[Here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Battle_of_Marathon_map-fr.svg) is the map of the military formations at the beginning of the fighting. It appears that the Greeks started in line then marched forward from their defensive positions with the center column, and then while it pulled back to another position the flanks moved past the center column to press on the Persian flanks. The Persian force seems to have been advancing and reinforcing its lines at the same time the Greeks were maneuvering.

So I think that a retreat by Greek forces did lead on the Persian infantry, but you are also right that the Greek flanks actively had to advance and maneuver to reach the Persian flanks instead of just waiting for the Persians to follow the Greek main line until they could envelope them. But I'm going to disagree about the direction of the Greek flanks. It seems that they weren't pushing the Persian wings back towards the sea, but rather pushing the Persian flanks *inward*.

I'll definitely concede that Greek hoplites were better armored and equipped, and that the discipline of the phalanx decreased the effectiveness of the Persians numerical superiority and their archers. Plus the Athenians didn't face the immediate threat of cavalry on the particular day the battle took place, which is why the Greeks attacked in the first place.

I wouldn't call Cannae a strategic failure, because that's an over-simplification. The ultimate defeat of Carthage was due to multiple factors, such as Rome's superior numbers of eligible fighting men and the ability to equip them, Roman generals Scipio and Fabian put pressure on territories near Carthage and Hannibal's supply lines, respectively, and the disdain that Carthage's ruling elite had against Hannibal (for many unjust and selfish reasons) who purposely hindered Hannibal's campaign. Hannibal actually won Italian allies after the battle, and the he didn't attack Rome because he was more eager to secure a peace deal with Rome and preserve it than risk either the destruction of Rome or his forces. The Second Punic War was a complicated affair.

Back to Marathon. Some historians believe that the double-envelopement of the Persian army was intentional, but others believe that Athens didn't have the training to intentionally use this tactic and rather the battle shaped this way naturally.

But regardless of Persian or Greek army troop composition, the tactic of the pincer did occur."

It's not impossible for MUA to change but it would be a lot of work for a while.

We also try to keep a very relaxed feel since we're aware of how people with genuine questions or makeup fears feel on MUA. They may not get a lot of constructive criticism in our sub but they usually get a lot of encouragement to keep practicing and ask questions.

CalvinDehaze,AskMen,1390770811.0,"I'm of Mexican decent and I know what you're talking about when it comes to Latin men and dancing. However, I would still say that there's a goal there. Latin men, from Mexico to Cuba to wherever, are very passionate and machismo. When Latin men dance, it's expressive, but it's a way of puffing their chest to get the women. And since there's more Latin men dancing, it's more and more accepted within the culture, almost to the point of becoming a requirement.
  
Take the whole [Mexican pointy boots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veQkt4tS0Tc) trend. This is a very blatant competition between guys. Whoever has the pointiest boots is the best, and probably gets the girls. This is very similar to antlers on a buck trying to get a mate. The bigger the antlers, the better chance you have of reproduction. Dancing in Latin culture has a goal. I've never seen a group of Latin guys dancing at a club just to dance. Their goal is to dance with a woman, and express how macho and passionate they is.
  
This model used to be true in America, with the 20's jazz craze, 40's swing dancing craze, etc. Dancing was one of the only ways you could interact with a female, and win her over. (So even then it was goal-oriented). But the 1960's came about and did away with all those old ways of men and women interacting. People still danced, but you didn't have to dance in order to get a woman. Since the goal was taken away, men didn't need to dance, so they didn't. Latin culture is still very traditional. Even if the rules are not imposed, Latin women still expect men to wow them, so there's still a goal to being a good dancer."

MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE,badhistory,1390770948.0,"I spent two years working at a think tank where one of my responsibilities was the read Ukrainian and Russian newspapers every week.  This was around the time of the Orange Revolution.  The way that historical events were argued about was an act of nation-building.  

There was a substantial dispute about Kievan Rus' in the Ukrainian newspapers, which I had trouble understanding the relevance of until I realized the different interpretations had to do with projecting Russian nationality backwards in time onto/into Ukraine.  During the Orange Revolution this became very heated, because the Orange coalition had its base of support in the West, which speaks Ukrainian, while the Kuchma-affiliated groups (supporting Yanukovych) had their base of support in the East, which speaks Russian.  

The Holodomor takes on similar dimensions when people want to construct or reinforce a Ukrainian national identity that is separate from (and perhaps opposed to) Russian identity.

There was a similar historical dispute in Korean newspapers over Chinese historians' interpretations of the Koguryo Kingdom, the Koreans fearing that this interpretation was laying the groundwork for a justification of Chinese annexation of North Korea in the event of the Kim family regime's collapse.

Anyway, Holodomor was certainly a preventable famine, and Stalin absolutely had a record of attempting to [destroy or break the internal national/ethnic identities within the USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union#Ethnic_operations)."

JohnTesh,economy,1390771228.0,"I'm gonna not pay attention to this article, and here is why. 

Beginning of article:
--------
...

Corporate cash piles have never been bigger, either in dollar terms or as a share of the economy.

The labor market, meanwhile, is still millions of jobs short of where it was before the global financial crisis first erupted over six years ago.

Coincidence?

Not in the slightest, according to Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs:
âThe strength (in profits) is directly related to the weakness in hourly wages, which are still growing at just a 2% nominal pace. The weakness of wages and the resulting strength of profits are telling signs that the US labor market is still far from full employment.
--------

The author just stated that profits are high because employment is lower, then used an economist saying wage growth is weak. Number of jobs and hourly wage are not the same thing, and while they may be related, you cannot use them interchangeably.

I am not refuting or supporting the assertion made by the title. I am just pointing out that the article sucks."

TIGit,AskReddit,1390771263.0,"I don't know man. I think it's a culturally cultivated insecurity that gets passed down by women and men. My own mother is distraught that I don't like makeup. 

But the thing is a lot of it is just about money. All these giant companies that control clothes and perfume and makeup have great media influence to control how our society a values beauty. Natural hair on a woman is disgusting, and all the hair removal creams razors and lasers are big money. Clothes sell better if you indoctrinate people into feeling insecure enough that they **need** to buy your products. 

And then there's the less product-money orientation of valuing women's appearances that comes in our culture from history. Hand-me-downs from an era where women belonged to their fathers until given to their husbands, no voting, and a woman's job was obedience unto men. We've for a long time not valued women as people but as objects for men's happiness. Raising strong women is a recent social idea, long predated by hundreds of years of legislated and culturally impounded viewing of women as weak minded and devoid of being full people."

SoyBeanExplosion,teenagers,1390771553.0,Only of you accept that it is an inherent part of humanity. I see that as a very cynical view. I think that for 99% of humans we have a desire to live in peace and harmony with each other even if sometimes things stop that from being the case. I don't think people knowingly do evil unless they're literally at gunpoint I suppose. I'm also kind of tired of the very vague critique of communism that it's only a 'good idea in theory.' Why is that? Surely we can look at the matter more closely than that? There are many forms of communism which vary significantly from each other. Stalinism was at the right end of the spectrum and so you can't judge the whole idea based on that alone. Some forms of communism don't even make use of a vanguard Communist Party.

ScipiiRye,MonsterHunter,1390771585.0,"Honestly, I wouldn't get my hopes up. In order for Capcom to release it on Wii U they'd have to weigh whether or not it would be profitable enough to do so. The Wii U is not that popular of a system, it hasn't been selling well, even in Japan, so the odds of them considering the Western market for a primary Wii U release seem out of character with what Capcom's been doing so far. Basically, they'd have to weigh whether the time and money it would cost to port, produce and distribute MH4U on the Wii U would be greater or lower than the money they stand to gain from it. 

I don't have access to those numbers, obviously, but I'm willing to bet that they wouldn't support a Wii U release.

The 3DS exclusivity, on the other hand, is a safe bet, since it's currently the 13th best-selling game console [in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles#Game_consoles) and insanely popular in Japan, which is where I imagine Capcom stands most to gain from MH sales."

Eagle-Eye-Smith,Israel,1390771848.0,"&gt;So its not at all clear why it is only the muslim arabs who should somehow monopolize the ""palestinian"" nationhood, itself a very recent construct.

So?

Just because they decided to form into a collective recently doesn't make them any less of a group than they are- They have unique music, unique food, unique history, a unique Arabic accent and many more features that distinguish them from the surrounding arabs. Why does it matter that they only managed to band together recently? Plenty of nationalities are fairly recent. The were forged from the same reason arab nationalities were formed- Foreign occupation and colonialism banded people together. In Europe and America it happened in the 18th century, over here it only happened in the 20th- Not because the elements of a proper ethnicity weren't there, but because they had no reason to band together.

Palestinian ""nationality"" now is about as ""fake"" as American nationality was during the late 18th century."

PsychFreak,explainlikeimfive,1390771956.0,"Here's the political answer: because unfortunately education is not a value that this country has.  No one seems to understand that we ALL benefit from an educated society; crime goes down, teenage birth rates go down, obesity rates goes down, health improves - there really isn't a disadvantage to educating the masses.  Unless, of course, you have lobbyists in DC with interests in things that placate the masses, e.g. reality television shows, cheap manufactured goods, fattening foods, etc. and keep society wanting anything BUT education.  So you have huge corporations with huge wallets who want to keep those wallets getting fatter, who devalue education and raise the value of their special interests, and use media to make us think that they're more important than they should be.

I realize I sound like a conspiracy theorist - and really, I'm not, I promise - but I have spent about half my life figuring out the things that are important in to me and in the world, and education has surfaced as one of the things that just doesn't have a bad side, and has many, many upsides.  And I see a culture of fear-mongering and consumer-good-worship doing nothing to promote that value, and lots of things to undermine it.  So the answer to your question is: books are expensive because education isn't important in our country, and money is.

deanerific,funny,1390772012.0,"FYI to everyone wondering: sexual harassment is a very vague and broad topic primarily related to an individual's actions and how others perceive them.

Could she be accused of sexual harassment for bringing erotica to work?  Probably.  How does OP know what she is reading? Is she reading it aloud, sharing it with others, or doing something to cause those around her to be uncomfortable?  All we have here is a visual joke with innuendo; we don't know what she is actually reading.  

Could OP be accused of sexual harassment for making crude jokes at the woman's expense for her choice of reading materials and then posting them on the internet for wide distribution?  Yes, particularly if she told him to leave her alone / his conduct was not acceptable to her.   Much easier case to make.

In fact, this picture could cost OP his job and his employer tens, or hundreds, of thousands of dollars from any litigation resulting from it.

The alpha option of not sexing her was MUCH MUCH harder and probably took some strength and internal fortitude. (not to mention that fact that it was the right thing to do for HER sake and your sake) You know deep down that was the right thing to do and now you look back with regret because you feel you might have missed out. It is not easy being ""manly"" in todays society, but that kinda comes with the territory. It is not easy to be manly or alpha, that is exactly the reason why most guys are not. 


Furthermore, you might question your masculinity about it because you are evaluating your measure of manliness against the common social stereotype. Stop that. Being a chivalrous virgin is just fine. I do not believe in the ""Beta Vs Alpha"" view of male hierarchy because if you look into evolutionary psychology it doesn't boil down to simple tough guys and wimpy guys. Life, as well as your identity, is so much more complicated than that. If anything bro, you are more of a man for sticking to your values than you would be for hooking up with her.

Likewise you can't use historical value of a film in the same year it came out (e.g. Citizen Kane or Goodfellas) so it is imperfect. I think for the Oscars, people just get mad that their favorite film/actor did not get nom/win so they assume it is some conspiracy. 

For all of the things that they apparently vote on (old guys), they are numerous counter examples. Hell, I read an article that said that the Oscars are now focusing on young people, when typically people complain that the Oscars always reward an old guy who hasn't won yet (e.g. Robert Redford but he ended up not getting nominated)."

Thus, you aren't really preventing abortions, you are just hurting people for doing things you don't like.

While we are on that path, why don't we refuse medicine to anyone who contracts HIV, because then there will be a deterrent to having unsafe sex?

Anyways, if you actually want to reduce the number of abortions, why don't you focus less on punishment and more on prevention and support.  The two quickest ways to drastically reduce abortions are:

1. Comprehensive education and access to a variety of birth control methods

2. Financial and other support (such as free day care) for single mothers so that they can see having a child as a viable option."

DonkiestOfKongs,pokemon,1390772417.0,"Sure. I agree with you, that it would spoil competitive play pretty thoroughly, and I'm going to pretty much redact my last post. My updated reasoning is as follows:

I always see people make jokes about 'aiming for the horn' etc and how it should be implemented in the games. I think something like a chance for a move to be normally effective instead of resisted or entirely resisted is an interesting idea. In RPGs, the analogy for a critical hit isn't that your attack hits *really* hard for some reason, but that your attack is perfectly executed. It is performed at the height of its power and hits the enemy in just the right spot and is therefore able to do a maximum of damage. This interpretation lends itself well to the 'aim for the horn' scenario. Under this interpretation, that was the depiction of a critical hit in the show. The discrepancy is that in the show this move was a 1HKO, rather than the 1x effective that it would have been in Gens 1-5, or the 3/4x as effective as it would have been in Gen 6.

With regards to type immunities, I was just wrong. Immunity is a fundamental inability to damage something and it's a core gameplay element so it should be preserved."

&gt; LGBTTQQIAAP members act like they will lose their gay card if they do not complain about everything.

I've never felt that way. Are you projecting your experiences on people who care about social justice? Gay people are treated like second-class citizens and that's bad."

She was wearing a tiny top and booty shorts. I imagined what it would be like to be her. I always wear a t-shirt and basketball shorts, but I thought about how great it would be to have the rest of the world think you were doing them a favor just by wearing revealing clothes. Every guy there was definitely checking her out. I contrasted it to myself trying to pull something like that off; the rest of the world would think I was placing a burden on them by wearing revealing clothes and I could definitely imagine people vocalizing their disgust (even though I don't consider myself disgusting, not fat and have a decent amount of muscle).

At no point did I actually want to be with her (wasn't my type), I just wanted to have what she had, and get the attention she got.

There was a point in there where I became very bitter and angry at myself for being attracted to the female body shape - like I was contributing to the very thing I was jealous of."

My freshman year of University we had a huge snowstorm that shut down the area (Northeastern PA). It was roughly over two feet of snow on Valentine's Day. I went to a relatively small campus of a large University at the time.

Anyway, the maintenance workers were trying to get everyone to move their cars to the other (now clear) parking lot, so they could clear this lot and make it accessible again.
I went out to help my friends with their cars because shovels were in severely short supply. We used anything that could relatively ""scoop"". I went out to help a couple friends and ended up working with the maintenance guys to get out thirty-four people from their excessively snowed-in spots. I was out there all day. I was actually the last car to move because I got caught up helping everyone else.

Full circle: I have a very recognisable vehicle that inspires hatred in people. it is just very loud in color and weird in appearance. It probably didn't help that I was an RA at the time.
The next year, someone decided it was a great idea to mix up a concoction of pudding, toothpaste, and dirt and throw it all over the driver's side of my car. I found out when a friend called me to let me know.

Because of my relationship with the campus police (I was friends with all of them) and the maintenance guys, they allowed me to use the maintenance shop to wash my car off. The head maintenance guy told me the only reason he was letting me use his shop was because of all the help I gave his crew and everyone else during that snow storm."

This is NOT in the context of consensual nonconsent, either.

This literally happens. Forget misrepresenting D/s relationships, thus book romanticizes explicit rape. If you think I'm exaggerating read the chapter-by-chapter review by The Pervocracy (blog). I'm into BDSM, I read a lot of filthy erotica, and I find Fifty Shades bafflingly repulsive."

3000 years ago there where no Abrahamic religion, I don't see the difference.

Enlighten me, what is the purpose of a ceremony in which you mutilate(Mutilation or maiming is an act of physical injury that degrades the appearance or function of any living body) an infant's sex organ?

You compared a archaic senseless religious mutilation ceremony with a voluntary medical procedure, we really don't have anything to discuss. 

You practice your religion freely, but when it comes to submitting a child to a unnecessary medical procedure just because it's written in a book, I draw the line, after you are the age of 18 you do what you believe God wants you to do with your body."

gerrettheferrett,introvert,1390772809.0,"I don't want to be rude, but if the guy just does not understand introversion, why'd you marry him? He has to have some good points too, right.

As for his ignoring what you are telling him, introversion or no introversion, that is just plain disrespectful and from an outsider's perspective shows a lack of caring on his side.

Have you given him literature relating to introversion? Perhaps information from an outside source might be more effective. Though it still speaks poorly for him to ignore what you are telling him.

But as far as the job goes, speaking personally, a job in a call center sounds great. You're never in the same room as the customers, they are always separated from you by at least one layer of technology.

This, coming from an introvert who has worked as a late night taxi driver in a college town, a Resident Advisor at university, and other high energy jobs.

As for your 4 year old, kids are actually the only people in the world that my introversion does not make a difference with. If anything, I am great with kids, so I don't know what advice I can give on that front."

You've worked yourself up into this state of rage and panic, and that's okay, but now it's time to talk yourself down so you can think clearly. Take some breaths, have a nap, take a shower, read a book, watch a show. Do something to just relax and lower the anxiety level.

Once you've done that I want you to make a few lists, because I want you to fully understand what you are giving up with this decision.

Make a list of everything you love in the world. Your initial reaction will be to throw up your hands and scream nothing. That you love nothing. But if you really reflect I'm sure thats not the case.

Start small. Write down your favorite food. Your favorite color. The best book you've ever read, or your favorite movie. Maybe progress to pets, people, and places. Just start a list, and keep going as long as you can.

Then start another list. Everything you want to do. Places you want to travel, people you want to meet, accomplishments you want to reach. I want to visit Italy. I want to see a giant panda in real life. I want to learn to surf. Anything.

Now read them over. Look at everything you will lose. All of the things you love you'll never get to do again, all of the experiences you will never get to have.

Suicide is not a solution, it's an escape. And I know that sometimes it can feel like the only option, but I promise you its not. There is always the possibility for things to get better as long as you don't give up. I know it's cliche but it's true. Every day you get up and add something to your lists is an accomplishment.

Riali,ABraThatFits,1390773091.0,"First, a 34DDD is a 32F or 30FF, so it's only two cup sizes smaller than your starting size, an unusual but not unheard of discrepancy.

There are a few thing that could come into play.  Very soft breasts sometimes measure a little bigger than their actual cup size, and conical breasts can measure a good bit bigger a times.  If you have a fair bit of a asymmetry, and the cups are fitting the smaller breast slightly better, that could also account for it too.  It could also just be as simple as a shape thing.  The 34DDDs could be a better shape for you than any of the other bras you've tried, and so fit better despite being a worse size.

He also believes that rape only counts as rape if it is inflicted by an armed attacker who lay in wait for the victim, and if it is defined as the violation of a man's property-rights in a woman rather than the violation of her own will and consent. He also says that women have no right to ""an environment free from unwanted sexual advances,"" and that there is some kind of conspiracy to falsely accuse men of rape in order to ""bully"" men. I don't see anything in here that seems to indicate that there is a mitigating context that renders

&gt; it would be better to ask how it could be taken seriously at all once we begin defining it as [a violation of a womanâs...merely personal wishes.]

Rape of a woman, to F. Roger Devlin, is NOT IN ANY WAY defined as her being forced or coerced into sex against her will and without her consent. Her will and consent are IRRELEVANT in this article.

And YET AGAIN, why are you so rabid to defend a known white supremacist manifesto, which was originally published in The Occidental Quarterly, an explicitly racist journal that described its mission as protecting âthe civilization and free governments that whites have createdâ? What exactly about this is so appealing to you that you feel the need to expend this much energy defending it?"

jareths_tight_pants,raisedbynarcissists,1390773607.0,"First, I'm so sorry. *hugs* It can be really stressful having to move back in with an Nparent after being on your own and learning that the relationship is dysfunctional. I lived with my NMom for a year and a half after I graduated with my bachelors degree and was trying to find either employment or get into a masters program. It was the most stressful and difficult thing I've ever done. The only thing that saved me was to find a full time job, save all of my money, and 9 months later move out into my own apartment with a roommate.

Second, no one's life is beyond repair. You seem very clear about what went wrong. Figuring out what needs fixing is the hardest step. Now you'll need to make a plan about how to get out of your NMom's house and drop communication to low contact or no contact. If your emotional turbulence is getting in the way then try making a list and prioritizing things. Tackle one thing at a time until you've met your goal.

And in regards to your friend there must be a balance between two people. It's pretty shitty of him to walk away from a friend who was so depressed she was driven to attempt suicide, but at the same time I can understand just how emotionally drained he may feel. You'll have to revisit that relationship once you're better. No one can be 100% of your emotional support. Having others to vent to or get comfort from is important, but you will need to learn how to be okay on your own.

Handyland,videos,1390773689.0,"I've only been watching since the start of 2010, but I've found these past four years quite exciting.  2011 wasn't great, but there was still some good racing going on behind Vettel.  I think there's been a lot of good racing in general these past several years.  A little while back, I downloaded both the '99 and...either the '01 or '03 seasons, I can't remember.  I think it was '03.  Maybe I'm weird (I probably am just for downloading two old seasons and watching them in their entirety in a month) but I actually enjoyed a lot of the racing back then too, but for different reasons.  What those seasons had that I feel modern F1 lacks is strategy.  (In fact, back in 2010 with the Bridgestones, I think there still was a bit of strategy present because of larger and more distinct and defined differences between the tires.)  Nowadays, it's a crapshoot with the tire strategy, but 15 years ago, you could follow throughout the race the development of each drivers race strategy: how many refueling stops they'd make, and at what time.  I liked that.  We always respond to NASCAR fans with, ""Yes there are less overtakes, but each one is more significant.""  Back in the refueling era, there was tension running throughout the race over how the strategies would work out.  There was less on-track action, but I found great excitement in Schumacher pushing to the very limit on an in-lap, and then coming out just in front of or behind his opponent.  It was more subtle action, perhaps.  So there was definitely something cool about those old seasons."
Flope,gamedev,1390773689.0,"&gt; First off, I don't think videos are the best way to teach programming. I think you need to be able to look at code with time on your hands, look it up and down and try to decipher what it means, rather than just saying 'here's some code, next'. If used, they should be supplementary materials to aid the text-based lesson.

Different strokes for different folks, I suppose!  I found video tutorials immensely helpful when I was learning myself, though that was back in a time when they weren't as easily found and 240p made it really difficult to read the text!

&gt;Specifics about the first video: You take way to long to get the viewer programming. You talk about knowing if the computer is 32-bit or 64-bit, what src is, constant mentions of concepts followed by 'but don't worry about that right now'. This just confuses a first time viewer. You need to start with the println method in my view or something equally basic, this is something people can understand and they'll think 'oh, that's not so bad, I just change the words in the quotes and I can make my own stuff. Cool. If you're saying 'oh, there's this, that's really complicated, and that, that's really complicated too, don't worry about that' for the first 5 mins, most people will just be confused and intimidated. It's better to strip everything down to what people need to know get programming.
I noticed a few errors in speech as well, like saying class when you meant method, that is unacceptable, you need to take down the video and re-do it to remove that kind of thing.

Unfortunately since the entry point into your first Java program is going to be *public static void main(String[] args)*, that line carries a lot of information that personally I don't think would fit the scope of a first tutorial about printing a line, so I need to tell people that we will cover that sort of stuff later, which we have, but for now to just focus on printing to the screen.  

&gt; So, don't use complicated language, don't presume your learner knows what you're talking about, don't talk about extraneous things, don't start with something more complicated than necessary (e.g. talking about classes before the println method), don't explain ten concepts at once and exercise, exercise, exercise.

I've done the dry rub before and enjoyed the flavor but I'm hoping to use this meat for a variety of dishes and can adjust better by only using salt/pepper during the roasting stage.

If you can not moderate and control your drinking, then I do think you should quit entirely.

PerfectHair,TiADiscussion,1390773875.0,"The thing is, when it comes to SJW's, they don't see individual encounters. Men are part of the oppressor group, and women part of the oppressed.

That way, every human interaction becomes a power struggle. If a man wants to go out with a woman and is lamenting the fact she's not interested in him, then he's awful because he feels that his status as the privileged one entitles him to a woman.

Conversely, if a woman is interested in a man and he's turned her down, he's oppressing the woman by reducing her to a commodity that he can either say yes or no to. To them, it's not only that he's not attracted to them, it's that he is passively resisting them because of his status as a patriarchal male, and he wouldn't be seen stooping to that level.

It's pretty fucking stupid. Attraction isn't formed in a vacuum, I understand that, but people are allowed to be attracted to who or what they are attracted to, and they are allowed to feel however they feel about it.

SJW's like to say they don't hate men. Which is true. They don't. But they also don't see men as people. They are the enemy. They are not human and they are to be eliminated. They also think this is how men feel about women.

The reality is, they're bullies who like to scapegoat men for all the wrongs in the world. And not just individual men. All men are guilty by association. They're complicit in the crimes of the few by virtue of the fact that the few made themselves the ruling class."

You probably don't need an entire day to do arms but it doesn't hurt (I certainly have had regular arm days in the past). Make sure you're lifting heavy and getting stronger as well as doing high rep pump work. Do both neutral grip bicep exercises like hammer curls and cross body curls as well as supinated grip exercises with dumbbells or barbells.

Work your triceps hard as well even if you do a lot of pressing. Pushdowns and skullcrushers are my two favorite exercises that I usually do for high reps, but I also do a lot of close grip bench presses.

I also like to do light (like LIGHT, 15-25lbs) curls with dumbbells in between sets of squats sometimes. Don't go to failure, just do it when you're resting before the next set and get a pump, feel the muscle working."

How far are you willing to go to prevent a single abortion?  

For example, we could lock up all pregnant women into a special camp until they gave birth, which would certainly prevent abortions.

Do you think we should do this?  What about sterilizing any woman who is pro-choice?

&gt; You may be on to something here. But unsafe sex harms its participants. Abortion harms a fetus for having the wrong mother.

The only difference between an unsafe abortion and a safe one is that it harms the mother (the participant).

&gt; It's not an either or. I am a huge proponent of BC, comprehensive sex ed, etc...

I personally have no problems with people creeping in the right lane, its when they impede traffic rather than moving so they aren't, that traffic gets fucked. Also, if you're uncomfortable going with the flow of traffic, hang out in the right lane with your flashers on.

Merad,BSG,1390774373.0,"&gt;What I don't get about the 'red line' is that, though it's supposed to be the limit beyond which it's not possible to surely plot a jump both accurately and safely, that isn't what we see in the Miniseries. When Adama gives the order to jump to the Perlmar Sector (or wherever it was) from the Ragnar Anchorage, Tigh protests that it's way beyond the red line, Gaeta states (with some initial uncertainty) that he can plot the jump. They they make that jump, with all of the civilian ships, successfully. What does the Red Line mean when they can do that?

IMO it really depends on what limitations the Red Line represents.  I'm inclined to believe that TRL is a general rule, but good information about the target area, or extra calculations, etc helps mitigate the risk.  We don't really have enough info though to say for sure.

Also, it would make sense for a fleet that one set of jump coordinates is calculated (in this case by Gaeta) and then distributed to all ships.  Gaeta got the calculations right, so everyone came through safely.  There would be a much greater potential for error if you had 50 ships each doing their own calculations.

&gt;If it was so dangerous, wouldn't they have done it in smaller steps, maybe two separate jumps?

The only real explanation that makes sense to me is psychological.  I think Adama was trying to make a statement about how they were stepping out into the unknown and not coming back."

dragonsky,SquaredCircle,1390774386.0,"If Cena is champion at WM:

-He faced Bryan few months ago so it makes no sense for us to see a WM match we've seen few months ago

-He faced CM Punk 1 year ago. They have big rivalry so it would make sense if Punk wins tonight

-He faced Batista in his last match and Batista can be back for vengeance, however Batista is face so it would be interesting to see if we will have face vs face match. It would make sense for Batista to win

-If Sheamus wins, it would make sense to have Sheamus as big heel trying to face the champion (again all of these are my opinions and doesn't mean that I want to see some of these matches necessarily)

If Orton is champ at WM:

-He last faced Sheamus more than a year ago so it's possible that Sheamus might win

-He faced DB few months ago so it would be pointless for DB to win

-He faced Punk 2 (maybe 3) WMs ago, so it is possible that Punk might win to face the hand picked champ of the Authority that hates Punk

-I can't remember when Batista last faced Orton, plus they are both former Evolution members hand picked by HHH so it would make hella lot sense for Batista to win


If Lesnar is champ at WM:

-He faced Punk half a year ago so it wouldn't make sense for Punk to win

-Faced Cena in his first match since his return and altough I can see some logic in this kind of match I doubt that Cena would win

-Any other guy would make sense to win: Sheamus (Brawler vs Brawler, old school vs new school), Orton (Two guys who reached their peak at young age), Batista (Two strong guys that left WWE), DB (David vs Goliath) 

So judging by the biggest favorites Batista can match up against every possible champ and have meaningful storyline so I pick Batista to win it and I would be satisfied with his win. How ever I want to be swerved tonight and have some non-favorite to win (HHH ? I would mark out for it)"

BroseidonSirF,highseddit,1390774498.0,"You will not like my answer because being attractive as a man is *completely* different than being attractive as a woman.

For girls, the most valuable asset for getting laid is being pretty. We can all agree that looks are the dominant factor in a girl's attractiveness. 

There isn't any dominant factor in a man's attractiveness. It's really a combination of things. **That's why women's taste in men varies extremely from girl to girl**, while most guys can generally agree that one girl is attractive.

____________________
**Behavior**

Personality. ""Alpha male"" behavior is very attractive in men. Girls are attracted to men who are leaders and act boldly and confidently. Think of James Bond. There's the whole fake it until you make it theory- behave like a baller until you actually become one.

**Physical attractiveness**

This one's what we think of the most when the word attractive comes to mind. It's your face, hair, stature, and just your body. That includes fat and muscle... the way you dress, etc.

**Status**

Girls are attracted to men of status. If you're an athlete you have some status. If you're good at whatever hobby you do, it gives you some status or value. This is also how other people treat you. Money and goods could superficially paint a picture of status, but superficial or not it's still some status.




____________

It's a combination of these three things that makes a man attractive. How important is each one? That's for the girl to decide. "

Bastion, while not exactly hitting all the marks makes does a good job at hitting many of the points the /u/radowr listed. It's short so it won't take a long time to finish. There no backtracking or time wasting on traveling. There are variety in weapons and builds that allow for variations, not much, but for a relatively short game it holds well. There are no stats increase but there are upgrades and limited boons that you can apply which adds to variation.

3. Zabaleta &amp; Ivanovic get a lot of praise from what I've seen. Honestly couldn't comment on the others. I agree Coleman is underrated but not as much as Johnson though.

4. If you'd watched some of the Liverpool games of late, the fact that blood has been drawn on him and he still does not get given free kicks is testament to it. I use Hull as an example because it is very evident. There was an obvious kick in the chest by Alex Bruce, he was studded and drew blood and yet neither incident was given a minute by the referee. There have also been at least 2 free-kick or penalty claims, perfectly legitimate, per game (on average) turned down this season because it was Suarez. His goal scoring record begs to differ. Ronaldo is the only one able to compete with him, and he hasn't been as good imo."

&gt;Let me decipher what's going on for the non-Russian speakers and probably some Russian speakers too, as the whole thing is pretty abstract.
In the very beginning, you hear the real recorded radio chatter from a battle in the the First Chechen War, where an entire Russian motorized infantry brigade comprised of raw conscripts was trapped, surrounded and getting wiped out the middle of Grozny, desperately begging the HQ for help on the radio, with the general responding by saying in a desperate, crackling voice: ""Just hold on a little longer, guys... the reinforcements are almost there! Just a bit longer, guys!"" Those reinforcements never got through.
A young Russian paratrooper (can tell by the blue striped shirt) in full battle dress and his AKS-74 is walking on the streets of modern Moscow and no one seems to notice him or pay attention, except for a crazy old beggar lady in an underpass.
Then, we see the scene where he's in Chechnya during the Second War, all of his buddies are dead and he is cornered by the insurgents, blowing himself and the insurgents up with a grenade rather than be captured, tortured, mutilated and beheaded.
From there on, those past events are played out in reverse, showing how he got there.
When we get back to present day Moscow, we realize that he's just a ghost... a shadow, invisible to everyone, except for the crazy old beggar lady. He walks around and looks befuddled at how much things have changed in the past 14 or so years, with foreigners talking on cell phones, Chechen kids dancing in the streets, a legless veteran playing guitar and begging, etc.
He sits down on a bench next to a beautiful, smiling teenage girl surrounded by other teens. If you pay attention, you notice that she has his eyes and nose.
The very last scene shows him back in Chechnya, before the battle, opening a letter from his SO and finding out that they are having a baby - a daughter, proceeding to celebrate with his buddies.
Before the credits, there are casualty stats on the two wars, 1994-2002: 8,000-30,000 insurgents Over 65,000 civilians Over 9,000 Russian servicemen KIA and over 32,000 wounded.
In the Chechen scenes, there is a lot of graffiti which has been seen in various footage and photos from the Wars, such as ""Welcome to Hell!"" and ""Die, Russian pigs!""

Considering that in 2012, 49.0 million Americans lived in food insecure households, obviously this goal is not being met.

The questions as to why it is not being met are plentiful, and are about more than simply a dollar amount given out.  Things like nutrition education and more access to higher quality food matter, yet are often ignored for the sake of just increasing the per person payout.

Furthermore, the program has horrible gaps in which a person who starts earning more at work ends up with far less assistance, causing them to actually end the month with less money in their pockets.  This may not exactly be ""encouraging people to stay poor"", but it certainly makes it hard for people to stop being poor.

Thus, there is certainly need for reform.  We need to be smarter about how we translate dollars into nutrition, we need to incentivize good food decisions, and we need to make support people moving up and off of food stamps."

Flope,gamedev,1390774815.0,"&gt; Recording screencaps is pretty good for absolute hand-holding people, especially for the specifics of Eclipse and starting a project etc., but I think for introducing concepts, just showing code is worse than showing some diagrams or something, that is, teaching the underlying concept instead of the surface appearance. That applies to things like package structure etc. Like you're talking about classes and visibility without introducing those concepts. Someone who needs to watch a video this basic won't understand that.

This is a good idea! Diagrams, I like it!

&gt; You also break the cardinal rule of teaching programming several times; ""Don't worry about that right now"". ""Don't worry about what that means yet."" Any lesson (on any topic) which includes this phrase needs to be redesigned with a new angle. I understand the intention is to get people started but this approach fails because it assumes the student has the same understanding of the underlying mechanics that you do. You want to go ahead and start teaching lines of code or algorithms, but a beginner programmer doesn't understand how or why what you're saying doesn't matter, doesn't matter. A beginner won't have the understanding you do that ""public static"" is irrelevant to the current example, for instance. To them it's all at the same level, but you're arbitrarily saying some bits of it don't matter.

Perhaps I should have been more clear about the complexity of some lines of code compared to others, but I'm sure you agree that fully defining and explaining *public static void main(String[] args) { }* is far beyond the scope of Episode 1 for someone who has never programmed before, so I am forced to say ""we will cover that later"" (we have!), but I think you raise an interesting point as to how it may appear to a newcomer.

&gt; You also might want to introduce concepts like, the Java API. These commands you're using aren't coming out of thin air and there's a finite number of them. I think it's pretty important to establish that for new programmers; people who feel lost with programming usually have this problem where the scope feels impossible, because they haven't been given a complete overview.

This is excellent advice as well!  Between episodes 2.5 and 3 I purchased a new microphone and finally set the text size to something I think works well for me and YouTube (this is a learning experience for me as well!), so I've often thought of re-uploading the first tutorial knowing now what I wish I did then for the format.

All excellent feedback, thanks for your support!"

Be dominant. Next time, say ""Let's meet up again some time soon. I can do ____ at ____ time or _____ at ____ time.

Diredoe,funny,1390775099.0,"You say that Thor is hypermasculine, but really the movie does a good job of subverting that. He gets very emotional, and tears up whenever Loki or Odin does something that upsets him. Indeed, the main plot of the movie was about him becoming much *less* of a brodude and becoming more of a decent, compassionate person who takes other people into consideration. 

The movie passes the Bechdel test in the first few minutes, which is such a simple thing but I really can't think of another leading superhero movie that does. The leading female character is a highly intelligent woman in a field that is very male-dominated and for whom the story revolves around, and this isn't shown as a bad thing. At the end of the movie she's still career-focused, and the film pretty much gives her a stamp of approval to keep on doing what she's doing. Compare this with a lot of other movies where if a female character is career-driven, is given a love interest, and then loses interest in her field of study due to the power of love. She definitely does a lot more in the movie than be someone who is threatened by the bad guys - she's a whole person with goals of her own, and achieving those goals was one of the main plots of the movie. 

Sif, too, was very feminist - she was a badass warrior who was neither hypersexualized, nor made the butt of jokes. 

Speaking of sexualization... none of the female characters are subject to it. All three main female roles (four if you count Frigga, but she was very much a side character) wore context-appropriate clothes, and none of the camera angles worked to show them in suggestive poses. 

On the contrary - the only time there have been long slow camera pans have been to *Thor*. For once, a big-budget superhero movie had a scene dedicated to the straight female gaze, rather than the straight male one. "
Xabrewulf,AskReddit,1390775101.0,"Honestly, I've never met an openly man-hating radical feminist in person either. I have met some women who claim feminism and are also a bit sexist towards men, but that's not exactly the same thing. They are an extremely small part of the community. But they get a lot of attention in the media and across the internet for the crazy shit that they spew, which influences people's perception of feminism as a whole. (Like [this article](http://www.vice.com/read/swedish-feminists-are-so-bored-theyre-telling-men-how-to-sit-on-the-bus)) How often do you hear about feminism being a helpful driving force these days?

The n-word is not offensive in an academic or historical context, and the simple word ""strange"" or ""weird"" can be extremely offensive if intended that way.

Remember also that the word ""gay"" was (and still is) used as an offensive insult (e.g., ""That movie was super gay""), yet it has been normalized over the past couple of decades significantly.  

Given the recent changes in attitudes, my guess is that ""queer"" will also be normalized over time, and will rarely be intended as offensive."

SibcyRoad,AskWomen,1390775148.0,"Fedoras can be done right, sure. But typically they are not. Paired with a graphic t-shirt, cargo pants and dirty Vans are not an aesthetic that appeals to me. At that point the hat becomes a prop, or something to hide behind. It removes any air of confidence because for whatever reason, the hat becomes the ""source"" of the confidence. 

Also, it's out of fashion. Which seems superficial but I think in many ways it can demonstrate how in touch someone is. I loved layered socks of all different colors. And sure I could *just* wear them with my high top kicks. But that would be out of place without the rest of my 80s inspired outfit. And if I did go all out, because it's not ""in"" right now, it would be seen as costume. Or ironic. 

Now, the term ""m'lady"" gives me a twinge of rage. And maybe that's my problem. But considering it was a term used for gentlewomen years ago means something. I am not a gentlewomen. I will not delicately tip toe around in my long dress, curtsy and feather around. I will not ""know my place"" or be subtle and reserved. It's just not my thing. At least not all the time. And back when that term was in vogue, that's what was expected. 

And when it's used as a greeting, my natural instinct is to be polite and mimic that social interaction in an effort to connect with someone. Like a cool handshake, high five or ""hey what's up,"" a certain amount of effort is needed on my part to keep the interaction on a level plane. And ""m'lady"" means I better call you ""good sir"" and let you kiss my hand. But nothing is that formal. And please don't invade my personal space and place your lips on my person. I don't know you like that. 

Add to that the fact that the term is also out of fashion. A majority of the people I interact with never say it. Thus tying in my earlier point of being out of touch while using it. 

But...that said...they are all my hang ups with someone else's form of expression. And if you or anyone else wants to wear the fedora and behave in an archaic manner, by all means, go for it. "

It is something no one should ever have to live in. The reason i never thought of it as a gaming chair was as such. Because it is a morbid thought to me, and I am sure it is also a morbid thought to many who have family and loved ones confined to a wheelchair. I dont know what kind of insensitive asshole you are that you cant make the leap from knowing crippled/disabled people that would give everything they own to not have to ever sit in a wheelchair again. To not wanting to own one for the sake of comfortability or leisure. 

Does that make sense now? Or are you too bat shit stupid to understand the feelings associated with love ones being injured/maimed/confined for life? To me a wheelchair is a two pronged symbol. A symbol of disease, injury, heartbreak, lose and yet a symbol of mobility and hope for those injured. 

So to end. I never thought of owning one simply because when that day comes. Something terrible will have happened. And I wish for no one to ever be bound in a wheelchair.

Does that mean for an instant I was suddenly a better conductor than the pure aluminum #8AWG aluminum cable cleanly attached to said lug? Absolutely not.

Honestly, you're so pretty that they all look good - none of them look bad - but I like the longer hairstyles better than the short ones, it balances out your face more. Also, #7 and #9 distract from your lovely eyes too much. Also, I'm not sure that the red really works with your complexion as well as blond or brunette does, but that could just be the color on my monitor - it might work in real life.

---- Paula's Choice 2% Salicylic Acid BHA. I have been using this product for 4 weeks now and it has made a huge improvement in the texture of my skin! My skin use to be really bumpy on my chin due to clogged pores and now it's nearly perfectly smooth! I did go through an initial two week purge, but that was to be expected since it's an active.

---- Silk Natural's 8% AHA Exfoliator. I received it last week, but still want to wait another few weeks before I incorporate it into my routine. Really hoping that it will fade the PIH I have on my chin from old breakouts.

---- Shiseido Gentle Sun Protection Lotion with SPF 33. Bought it today and I love it! No greasy feeling, leaves my skin feeling smooth, and feels hydrating! It is mostly sheer and has a tiny white cast I think, but then again I'm so pale that you can't notice it haha. It was expensive (47$ for 100ml), but I much prefer it to the Nivea one I was using before. 

---- CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. It was on sale at my local Target so I decided to buy it! I'll be test patching it for the next week to see if it agrees with my skin. I'm hoping it does because my normal moisturizer just isn't cutting it anymore this winter. My skin is constantly flaky (even before introducing the BHA), so hopefully it will resolve this issue!

jareths_tight_pants,StudentNurse,1390775538.0,"5 People failed fundamentals? That's a lot. What's your program's pass rate for the NCLEX?

Fundamentals wasn't that bad. Just read the book, take the practice ATIs, and buy a good NCLEX book like Saunders or Kaplan. The sooner you learn how to answer NCLEX questions the easier off you'll be.

Your program may be different but in my program we're not tested on A&amp;P but on nursing application. You still have to know A&amp;P of course, but the more important thing to focus on is the nursing intervention for the disease process rather than the nitty gritty details.

I spend about 5-6 hours a day 5 days a week studying/reading for lecture, an extra 5-10 hours extra studying for exams including answering NCLEX questions and doing ATI practice tests, and about 3-4 hours/week doing clinical prep/paperwork.

TheCryptic,electronic_cigarette,1390775556.0,"No, I'd rather you do neither.  I find it interesting that vaping is perfectly fine because it's nothing like smoking, but as soon as someone thinks you shouldn't do it that smoking is suddenly a viable alternative.

Seriously, your lungs are not designed to process the ingredients in vapor, they're designed for air.  Vaping is a less harmful alternative to smoking, but that hardly means it's harmless.  On top of that, if you just want flavor then there are plenty of  candies that use diacetyl to really make the flavor pop.  If you want nicotine then you're starting a drug addiction that you've managed to avoid for the first18 years (right?) of your life.  And if you just want to chuck clouds then you're putting yourself at risk simply to look cool.

So agree with me or not.  Smoke, vape, or not.  As an adult you get to make the decision for yourself, I'm certainly not trying to step on your rights.  But don't separate smoking from vaping in one sentence then join them together in the next."

Lower middle class people are the ones walking the finest line. God forbid they ever need an appy, or to have their gallbladder taken out, or break a bone. Years of expensive bills in addition to time off from work for recovery. 

There was a study done in 2011 about people's ability to withstand a sudden $2,000 bill. It showed 50% of Americans would not be able to pay it down in 30 days.

http://www.nber.org/papers/w17072

And $2,000 doesn't buy you a whole lot when you look at how expensive an IP stay in a hospital costs. 

In some states the Affordable Care Act is going to expand medicaid to include people who are single and make very little money. I think that's a great safety net in case of needing emergency care that would otherwise send someone into a financial crisis. Good thing we are seeing more NP's and PA's going into family practice type roles. I feel like they might take over the burden of medicaid pt's who have a hard time finding a doc accepting office visits for people on medicaid. In this sense I feel the ACA will make healthcare in the US a little better. 

As far as the ACA for people who now need to go out and find their own health insurance, I don't know. We'l just need to wait and see about that. 

I don't mean to turn this post into a discussion about the ACA, but asking Americans about privatized healthcare while we're right in the middle of making this transition, this is where the discussion will naturally end up.

RX_queen,AskReddit,1390775607.0,"Oh man, this is one of my most vivid memories from my childhood... In my small backasswards hick town kindergarten class, all the kids (and hell, some of the teachers) picked on the one very dark skinned kid, D'Adrian, and he was always getting into trouble and fights and stuff. Hell, he may have been the only black kid in the entire school. Life must have really sucked for him at that point. 

One halloween my parents went all out and made me a beautiful sparkling gold fairy costume with a dress and a wand and giant wings and a gold sparkly mask. I basically wore that thing every night for a week until halloween, I *was* the goddamn golden sparkle fairy in my mind. On the school day where everyone wears their costumes, I took the mask off for snack time and when I came back it was gone. I was a really shy kid and I started to cry of course, and nobody really noticed, except for D'Adrian, who proceeded to spend the entire playtime looking for it. At the end of the day he shyly handed it to me and I kissed his cheek with a thank you. 

We never spoke or interacted really after that, and he moved away at the end of the year. From then on I've always wondered where he ended up and if he's had a better life than what this shithole could offer. "

Ever heard of the Civil War?"
duffmanhb,worldnews,1390775636.0,"&gt; The most logical action would have been not to play the political game in the first place. And keeping yourself in such a power play puts yourself even more at risk. If you're looking at this in terms of a Machiavellian manner, the question is whether he could have found a way to keep his family fortune (his power) while not having to answer to familial obligations.

It's important to understand that the family fortune is not the power. Yes, as a westerner we attribute wealth to power, and objectively it is. But his power rests mainly within his dynasty. Do you really think his siblings are out of this mess? Oh hell now, they are still around doing what they are doing. In fact, Un didn't even want to be in charge, but one of his brothers wanted to be in charge, but his dad made the final decision making Un the successor. The WHOLE family is in this game.

No one could realistically walk away from this. If they did, that means that branch of the family has subsiquently abandoned what their honor culture expected of them. Again, as western not in an honor culture, this sounds moot, but when you are raised in an honor culture, it has significant effects on you. 

&gt; But there's other logical moves. NK is in very bad economic and cultural shape; it's a country that literally has nothing to lose compared to its neighbors. Sometimes causing a sort of revolution of old ideas can be viewed as the ""best move.""

This is actually the scariest part of the situation. That coupled with Southern retaliation puts the region in a sketchy position. DPRK will certainly attack if it's their last option. They'll likely lose, but there will be massive casualties on all sides that the likes of the last World War. This is why I, along with many other political scientists agree.

**PLEASE do yourself a favor and check out this video**: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g98pZSKQPtA

Both parts are really well done lead by the worlds leading expert on the situation in the North. The first part has to do with perception, and the second has more to do with the international relations perspective. It's fairly objective without the rhetoric. It's REALLY good; I highly recommend it!

&gt; What happens if the countries call their bluff? It doesn't really matter for North Korea aside from their leadership. They can bluff even further and see if South Korea takes the bait.

Like I said, I don't think anyone will call that bluff. We all know it's a bluff, but the cost is too tremendous. America's position in this situation is containment of the North and avoiding war at all costs. Meanwhile SK wants reunification, so they aren't opposed to conflict. China, wants NK to exist as a black hole buffer between it's region of influence and the West. Japan wants to stay far the fuck away out of this as possible, because they are on the list for MAD. 

Realistically, NK is not a short fuse waiting to go off. Short fuses don't sit around for 60 years not going off. It's all posturing and no side wants it. Everyside just wants to stop the squabble and have more regional stability. 

Which is exactly why NK wants a nuclear arsenal and will likely never give it up. To them, this is their ace up the sleeve that ensures their protection. IMO, holding onto that arsenal is a very logical and critical move. If they give that up, they put themselves in a bad position for negotiations.  

&gt; But ramping up war each time and seeming ""strong"" is a delusion, an idiotic effort that is meant to fool their own people rather than make anyone else really afraid.

Luckily with the new President of SK, I think that time is over. In the late 90s we thought NK and SK conflict would have fizzled by now. But unfortunately some political posturing blew up in to a SK vs NK escellation. It was triggered by a conflict island the north and south have been bitching about for ages. SK really should have just let it go, but they were trying to make a point and insisted it's theirs (this is the same island NK shells from time to time). A NK patrol boat was near the waters, and SK shot it down. This spiraled into NK retaliating with several relatively smaller strikes, which was responded with a far heavier handed response from SK -- and that's when it all started going to shit. 

&gt; Of course, this also depends on many other setpieces that we don't know about. We're not sure what the North Korean government is like, how the factions are split, whether Kim has an immense following within his inner circle, and so forth. Was it just his uncle that he has to fear?

I think since the family dynasty is so ingrained into the culture and propaganda, a descendant of Sung has to be in power. There are no two ways about it. The only people that could have a realistic chance and effectively transitioning power is someone from the Kim family. And as it stands, the only person that could have done that is now dead. So it seems safe to say that Un is here to stay. It's his country now.

---------------------

I think what's important to also understand here, is most nations aren't trying to play moral police. They understand international relations is complicated and what the international community wants is just stability. And honestly, after these recent moves, I think we are one step closer to stability. The threat of a coup is pretty much over. There may be other factions but they are going to have a hard time getting support being outside of the family. Also, a coup like this could easily flip the country on it's head with every elite and general going down with that sinking ship. It's in everyone's interest to just let Un run the show and focus on building positive relations. Like I said, I  would put my money on NK being much more stable and better off 10 years from now. Yeah, it'll still be a dictatorship, but that's life. "

dalviel,OutOfTheLoop,1390775753.0,"Sorry, it was offensive. But it was a defensive maneuver to save face, not hate speech. When that woman stood up  Tosh had two options: 1) either break character and (disingenuously) acknowledge how rape can never be viewed in a comedic context. 2) in the moment, try and keep the audience laughing, like they (and that woman) laughed through war/violence jokes, race jokes, and everything else it's hard to talk about. So he could have either lied about his own opinion, or kept doing his act. He chose what he thought was the right option, and executed it poorly. 

A better reaction to the same situation would be to outline what I tried to above, that the person's offense is biased. Comedy is a way of seeing things we're uncomfortable about in in an absurd context, so we feel less hurt by that idea, if only for a second. That's what Tosh tried to do with rape jokes, he wasn't inciting sexual violence. Not being passive aggressive, but I hope you understand my point better now. "

AshleyYakeley,PurplePillDebate,1390775817.0,"&gt; Do you have any evidence that biology can affect the particular structures that the paper found?

Biology obviously affects *all* structures of the brain, and all of the rest of the body. I'm pretty sure almost every human being has a corpus callosum, for instance, regardless of developmental environment.

&gt; Surely if the authors had evidence either way, they would have concluded innate or learning causes but they didn't (because they had no evidence to conclude it was one or the other).

Well, this is what they said:

&gt; The observations suggest that male brains are structured to facilitate connectivity between perception and coordinated action, whereas female brains are designed to facilitate communication between analytical and intuitive processing modes.

What does ""designed"" suggest to you?

&gt; But actual evidence, if you like (ignoring the fact that many of the effects they found changed over time suggesting, at least in part, a learning effect) can be found in second language learning since 'language' was one of the differences. Try this paper: Second-language learning and changes in the brain.

That paper doesn't examine the connectome at all, just at relative volumes of grey matter. (Also n=4...) I'll ask again, do you have any evidence that learning can affect the *particular connectivity structures* that the paper found?"

thingstodoindenver,sex,1390776018.0,"First, the guy was being an asshole -- he's got to learn to communicate more positively.  That said, I believe I understand his point.   I just ended a year-long relationship with a woman and before being with her, I might not have understood. So here goes:

The girl I dated was great: smart, fun, and very attractive, and she really liked me.  One of the problems that we had, though, was that sex between us was very different from each of our perspectives.  She enjoyed sex but to her, sex was a 'formulae' or 'method' to figure out and then perpetuate with the goal of orgasm at the end.  For myself, however, while I certainly love cumming, I treat sex more as a dance, an artistic, but intimate, expression of the feelings I have for the person I am with.

So after a few months of getting to know each other better, sex with her became extreme regular and practically mechanical.  Almost paint-by-numbers.  For blow jobs, which she didn't *mind* doing but obviously didn't relish it, they eventually became a step-by-step method to get me to come and when I came the relief of her having finished was palpable.  And it usually left me feeling very unsatisfied.  

To be clear:  I have a want-it-all attitude for sex but never at the expensive of the enjoyment of my partner.

I'm a man. And I love having my dick sucked, but the experience was entirely rote, unimaginative, and mechanical with the sole goal of getting me off.  I want sex between me and my partner to be adventurous, exciting, passionate.  A combination of sometimes giving-it-all and sometimes taking-it-all but communicated through the expression of feeling.  Not the completion of an algorithm to get me to climax.

To that end, 'one-night-stand' sex is (or can be) like that:  wild, passionate, exploratory.  No reason why sex with a long-time SO can't be the same, right?


FWIW, we talked about it at length and even went to counseling about it but she was unyielding in her feeling that 'she was doing everything I wanted.'  But she never could grasp that all I wanted was for her to get lost in the feeling between us.  For us to be like improvisational musicians, not a dance team executing a overly-rehearsed performance devoid of transcendental spontaneity."

So if Rob Ford isn't reelected, the new Mayor has to deal with that kind of financial burden. That likely means increased taxes... which ex-Mayor Rob Ford gets to shout about, because Council is back to its gravy ways."

To be honest everyone has their own boundaries, even without past trauma coming into play. I know people who are phobic about having their feet touched; it's not triggering, they just can't stand it. Some people will even reflexively kick out if their feet are touched unexpectedly (I used to live with a girl like that). It is in this kid's best interest for his parents to intervene as best they can with this behaviour now. He's getting a bit too old for people to be tolerant when it comes to invading their personal space. The next person most likely won't be his brother's girlfriend, and if it was me I'd get the fright of my life!

QuestionEverythin,AskWomen,1390776274.0,"Yes. When I was 14 I met an awesome guy who was 17, and had aspergers. While he was actually only 2.5 years older than me, not only would I not be allowed to date him, but I was afraid of judgment being passed on him. (assuming he was interested in me anyways, lol) He actually thought I was a senior up until the second week of my knowing him. (but so did a lot of people. I've always thought it a bit of an anomaly.)

Of course, seeing as I was having (other) issues of my own, and he was wonderful and patient and kind and so intelligent; I never told. I think I told my best friend at the time but no one else knew. And because I was so good at hiding things (see..other issues) and he had aspergers, which meant he wasn't really going to clue in anyways, he never realized. So we simply became really good friends. He stayed for a victory lap (kinda like grade 13) to take extra courses, so it was lovely to have him around for another year. 

But I can't help but wonder what might have happened if we met at University; with the age difference not mattering and me being brave enough to show my interest.

TheFlamingOne,pokemon,1390776320.0,"Firstly, maybe my assumption was wrong, but you are assuming way bigger things here. First of all you are assuming that we are on a high horse. You are not seeing the problem here. The problem isn't the fact that pokebank isn't out yet, we can deal with that fine. HOWEVER, the fact that they have released PokeBank in Japan and still can't give an estimate is pretty strange. Hell, even if they can't give us an estimate, tell us, very specifically what exactly is going wrong that is delaying release. 

You are assuming that we can't understand whatever issues they may be having while most of us can. If they had unforeseen problems, we don't mind as long as you tell us. It's basic PR for any company. You at least owe your customers who were excited for a release that much. You can white knight for Nintendo, I agree with you that they don't deserve as much of the bitching that they get, but they deserve a decent amount of it.

Like I've said in my previous posts, those statements amount to nothing. They literally didn't disclose more information that they're still testing. If I were to run a big company like Nintendo and this stuff happens I'd make sure that the fanbase gets at least some information as to why it's being delayed. Take 10 minutes out of an engineer's schedule to post an article on your website, or whatever. If we see what they are working on, we're more likely to understand. 

You're completely missing why people are annoyed and you are defending Nintendo way too easily. This is rightly something to complain about, however the amount of complaining being done is maybe a bit too much. However, and I'll stress this once again, communication is key. They aren't communicating with us, so we as customers have to let them know what we want. Every big company right now, literally every single one (talking game industry that is) is one that listens to its customers. Valve? Yeah, no need to explain. Riot Games? Yeah, they interact with their community on reddit and various other forms of Social Media. Blizzard? Doing great work listening to beta testers on features that they would like to see implemented into their new game Hearthstone and the controversy around people wanting to buy level 90 characters on WoW. Why wouldn't Nintendo be able to do the same? 

tl;dr communication is key when resolving unforeseen issues, nintendo doesnt communicate, gg nintendo."

Allowing direct links to images promotes a culture of fast content consumption, allowing posts to be read in a matter of seconds.

attakburr,dogs,1390776335.0,"Volunteering at a shelter is a great way to spend time with dogs an also start to get to know different (although common) breeds. For example, I'm  about to bring home a staffy puppy next weekend and it is a direct result of volunteering at shelters. Shelter time also reaffirmed that I am definitely not a small dog person, and that although labs are cute and sweet I have no strong attachment to any of them that are pure. Personality just isn't there for me. 

One thing I will say though is that dogs are STRESSED in shelters. No matter how happy the dog is normally, it will always show a slightly different personality when in a shelter environment for any given period of time. And all dogs handle that shelter time differently. Some only need to be there a day to show dramatically different behaviors, some change over a period of weeks.

Another option is to look up dog care center/haven type places that also offer on-site training. Ask if they take on volunteers for classes. It's a really good way to see how much time a dog can really be. For me it also really emphasized the importance of dog socialization at a young age as the first class I observed was a leash reactive classes. Those dogs were so terrified of everything and their owners were just dumbfounded on what to do. Heart breaking to see them that way, but also amazing to see how much time and dedication can do towards reversing those fears."

goundo,climbing,1390776429.0,"You *can* bolt routes in Yosemite. You just have to use a hand drill. This is a good thing, since it encourages minimal bolting, balancing the desire to climb a route with the desire to leave the rock in its natural state. If you are hand drilling, you only place a bolt where you *need* a bolt.

From my point of view, the fault in your logic is that you are thinking of safety as a binary state - either you are safe or you are not. But this is simply not true. The entirety of climbing is based on the premise of calculated risk: ""how much do I want this route"" versus ""how dangerous is this route"". Every time you tie into the rope, or for that matter, get into a car, you are making a calculated risk. It is a personal decision, and it is up to each individual to make an evaluation of their own skills. If you are 70 years old with easily shattered hips, climbing up to the first bolt 15 feet off the ground might be too much for you. Does that mean that every first bolt should be 5 feet off the ground so that even an elementary school kid can clip it without leaving the ground?

Remember: fun first, then style, *then* safety.

I also don't see why this attitude needs to change. There are plenty of well protected moderates for people to climb, all over the country. Why insist on making the bolder routes more ""safe""? I assume you also want to cover all the sharp edges in rubber foam?"

waspbr,funny,1390776457.0,"&gt; I have a feeling most men that age are a little different.

most people that age (me being one of them) have had a whole lot shit and curve balls thrown them. When you are younger you kinda try to find yourself, you put up with and do a lot of stupid stuff that later in life is going to annoy the crap out of you. 

For instance I was dating this 25 year old who had just started her doctorate. When going out with her and some of her friends, they had brought some liquor in a backpack and tried to sneak it into the pub we were going. It annoyed me because I just wanted to sit in the pub order some drinks and relax, rather than trying to hide some cheap spirit just for the sake of getting drunk. They thought that being fucked up and self destructive was awesome and she went with them. Needless to say that it did not last very long. 

In my experience, at some point in life you figure exactly who you are and what you like. The people that are not compatible with me don't really need to be in my personal life.  So you stop putting up with arseholes and overgrown children.

So yeah, men that age are bit different in that respect.

One big one is the appraised value of the home and estimated resale value, another is your disposable income (money you have left over after paying your bills). Another consideration is the avg. $ per sq. ft in a region. Also the amount of taxes and homeowners insurance you will be paying. A higher downpayment also helps. There isn't a one size fits all formula with variables x and y (being your assets) as the only consideration.

Escaides,OkCupid,1390776560.0,"On Friday I had a date with an attractive 26-year-old gentleman, which was only mediocre, but I guess going in, I wasn't really ready to give it my all. I have trouble engaging fully with people when my life is spiraling out of control and lately I've been having trouble with lack of feelings of self-worth, so while we were messaging back and forth on OkCupid I let the conversation trail off for several days and would surely have faded on him had he not bit the bullet to double-message me and ask me out. (It didn't help that he older, one of these cultured and well-traveled types whose pictures made a big deal out of all the places he'd been in Europe. It's kind of intimidating for someone who's never been out of the country.)

I gave him my number and he texted me to set up the date. I didn't even bother trying to text him in the 3 days between then and the date, since I don't really enjoy texting somebody I haven't met face-to-face and I'm pretty flakey about keeping up with texts if they try usually anyways.

On Friday I text him to apologize for not being much of a pre-date texter and confirm for the date. I get the green light, so I show up at the coffee shop, go in for the awkward hug greeting, make awkward conversation. It's crowded in the coffee shop but nice outside, so after we get our drinks we go for a walk around the strip, stop at a bench for a while and sit and talk in the sun.

I was trying to read his body language to see if he was nervous, and I could tell that he was at least a little bit, but hiding it well. My own insecurity was fucking things up, I was talking too fast and meshing some of my words together (which I NEVER do... wtf) and I used the word ""like"" too many times. The post-viral cough I have isn't helping. I was mostly having trouble because my date was reserved and difficult to read. The weird thing is that he reminded me a lot of my last boyfriend in his mannerisms and patterns of speech; it was the same sort of calm, deliberate articulacy.

Several things that he said/did kind of threw me, like when I suggested we go to the bookstore nearby, he asked ""Why would we want to do that?"" When I was talking about being able to see the stars really clearly out in British Columbia while camping, he argued that I should be able to see the stars almost just as well from where I live in the city (I live on the edge and there's still a ton of light pollution... nowhere near the same thing.) I told an anecdote about a Fillipina coworker and how her life had given me some perspective and he started arguing with me about the point I was trying to make before he'd finished hearing me out. Little arguments that left a bad taste in my mouth and made me not enjoy conversing with him.

We did end up spending some time talking in the bookstore, and we wound up getting dinner as well. During the course of the date, I learned he:

* Harbors some weird resentment towards Canada (he was born in Hungary and his parents moved here when he was ~10 years old), which he wears on his sleeve
* Has a strong sense of wanderlust and has already accrued debt due to travelling
* Still lives with his parents (which I consider more of a logistic problem rather than a poor reflection on him)
* Is two months out of a 5-year relationship.

Overall there were a lot of weird, awkward moments on that date that threw me, I could not seem to read him or get on his wavelength, and there were the aforementioned potential dealbreakers. I'm not sure if I even liked him nevermind having romantic potential with him, but he was handsome and had a clever, quirky sense of humour that made me laugh.

I kind of made a hasty exit from our date to avoid the awkward ""what do you want to do now"" conversation since I obviously wasn't going back to his parents' place. I did give him a goodbye hug, though.

Pretty sure this is the kind of situation that usually results in a mutual instafade, but we'll see. Someone on the sub once said that if the first date isn't a complete shitshow, you should opt for a second, and I tend to agree since first-date nerves can really interfere with chemistry, but text convos with him since have tended to fizzle out as well.

Meh."

dbaker102194,gamingsuggestions,1390776592.0,"Mabinogi would be a good one. I can't recommend the game enough. The learning curve has gotten really fucking steep lately (it used to be really simple, but they didn't do a good job of keeping it that way.) but it's not impossible to learn to play. A little task management will get you really far. 

It's community based. Which is something I like about it. You can either grind for weeks to do a quest alone, or take 10 minutes to go find someone to run with through it with you and do it right away. 

Combat isn't even the main focus of the game. It's set up so that you form your own unofficial guilds and clans and friend groups. Guilds actually became an in game feature, but that happened later. Anyway, it's set up so **you've got to pick a path to take; warrior, archer, smith, healer, chef, quarter master, miner, lumberjack, etc.** You can potentially beat any story line (except tutorial) without fighting a single monster, but you do need someone to fight the monsters for you and you would have to be in a support role, supplying them with potions or armor or weapons or whatever. The rebirth system allows you to start your mastery of a new skill set whenever you want. That's not to imply you're locked into one particular skill set, you can be a jack of all trades if you want, but then you're basically useless, because there will always be someone who is so much better than you at anything (going back to the grind for weeks or partner up and get it done now idea).

There are currently (at least) 14 ""main"" quests (as in each one will take you *days*), and a shit loads of side quests. So there's plenty of content, exploration is also a feature on the ""new world continent"" of Iria. 

It is F2P on Steam or Nexon.net. Nexon is the developer, I've had a few issues using the steam client with it, but if you prefer to use it in your steam library then go for it.  It does have pay-to-win esque things like pack animals, or animals to fight along side you, recently you can hire NPC's with real world money, but regular mounts are available in real cash or in game currency (I think mercenaries can also be hired with in game currency it's just a waste of money though, unless you're PVP'ing.)

Also it's mostly co-op, there's no PVP requirement for anything, it's just kinda a fun thing to do if you feel like it. I find that to be a plus. "

DonkiestOfKongs,news,1390776628.0,"&gt;forbidding of any mention of God or prayer in public places

You're being disingenuous. I don't advocate this. I never stated or implied this. Assigning this position to me and using it against me is intellectually dishonest. If you *honestly* consider this to be a valid interpretation of what I said, then you need to stop and re-read what I wrote, because you are mistaken. In fact, I *explicitly* stated the opposite of your interpretation when I said:

&gt;I'm fine with teachers wearing crosses, or maybe having some sort of daily devotional sitting on their desk that they might read during their scant free time

It is possible to accept my view, *and* still pray as much you want in school. You can bring a bible, read it, do whatever you want with it. Wear a cross. I'm fine with religious clubs, as long as the administration is being fair about it.

Some examples:

Acceptable: Susie is reading her Bible to herself at her table during lunch at school. Afterwards she bows her head to pray and asks God to help her apply what she has just read about kindness and generosity to the rest of her day, and to help her with her math test this afternoon.

Acceptable: Mr. Smith is supervising the detention students. He's trying to grade some papers because he wants to have a free night this evening because his wife just asked for a divorce, and he's very close to the end of his rope. A student throws a spitball at him, and he becomes very angry. He turns to the page in his daily devotional where it discusses how to deal with anger during hard times, reads it to himself, recites the 23rd Psalm to himself, adds another day of detention to the student's sentence, and resumes grading papers.

Not acceptable: It's 9th period science, and Mr. White is trying to teach geology, specifically how the islands of Japan were formed. Janine, the eighth-grade Shintoist, won't have it, and is loudly reading the creation story from the Kojiki. She is not allowing Mr. White to teach, interrupting the learning of other students, and negatively affecting everyone around her by improperly displaying her faith.

Not acceptable: Eric is a Zen Buddhist. His teacher tells him that is stupid, and that Pure Land Buddhism is obviously the only path to enlightenment.

Acceptable: Bobbi-Jo just made a killer spike in volleyball, winning the tournament, and adding a happy ending to a heart-wrenching but touching underdog story about hard work and determination. At the trophy ceremony, she thanks God for giving her the talent, and for being their with her no matter how hard or grueling practice was.

Not acceptable: Francis is gay. His peers call him a faggot and tell him he's going to die of AIDS and burn in Hell, because that's what their religion believes.

Not acceptable: Jacquelyn and Marsha attend the same church and school. In the hall between classes, Marsha is talking to Jacquelyn about how excited she is to go on the mission trip to Guatemala this summer, and how great it is going to be to grow closer to God while giving back to those in need. Principle Anderson overhears, and expels both of them for mentioning God.

Not accpetable: Susie gets to math class. She's really freaking out now. She's really not ready for this test. Mrs. Jones notices, and leads the class in prayer asking for wisdom and knowledge for all of her students.

Here I've given examples of a hypothetical school where faculty and students alike are allowed to integrate religion in their lives and experience it on school property, during school hours, all mysteriously while not having the walls covered in Bible verses or having the morning announcements include a sectarian prayer.

I've also given examples of instances where anyone could be guilty of abusing their right to free exercise, faulting both the religious and non-religious.

Do you see how it is *ENTIRELY* consistent to exercise your religion however you want, up until the point in begins to affect someone else, and when that line is crossed you're infringing on the rights of others? Do you see how it is *ENTIRELY* possible to desire to foster personal religious growth, while at the same time not wishing to allow religious practice to infringe on the rights of others? Do you see how it is *ENTIRELY* possible to discourage people from abusing their right to free exercise, without ""the forbidding of any mention of God or prayer""?

In short, it is a student's right to bring religion to school, but it is not okay for the school to bring religion to the student. It is also a teacher's right to bring religion to work, but it is not their right to share that religion with students."

Diredoe,funny,1390776680.0,"The first paragraph deals with loosening male gender roles - it's expected that men be stoic and unemotional, but Thor, Loki, and Odin all get very weepy in the movie at parts. Thor's heart gets broken when he learns of Loki's actions, and rather than get pissy and and angry (which is the typical uber-masculine response in genres like this), he cries and begs him to explain why.

As far as sexualization goes, it's all about the inequality. Much more women are sexualized in films, which suggests that those are created specifically for the straight male audience. There is really nothing inherently wrong with having sexy female characters (Black Widow and Pepper Pots come to mind as sexy female characters that, for the most part, are whole characters on their own and can go toe-to-toe with their male counterparts), but the fact exists that you don't have to search long to find a big-budget action movie that only has sexy female characters, but doesn't give the male characters the same treatment. You *do* have to look further to find the opposite. 

By Thor having an emphasis on the titular character's sex appeal and not as much on the female characters', it brings those scales of equality more into balance. 

I'm *not* saying that all female characters should have no sex appeal and male characters should be all about it - but having options for both straight males and straight females (and gay males and gay females, and bi males and bi females, and, etc.) would be awesome. And right now we don't have that in action films. "

millapixel,AskWomen,1390776718.0,"The ""m'lady"", hat tipping and so on can be quite sweet, but if done to me by a stranger I would think it a bit odd and potentially creepy. If my boyfriend does it occasionally? Sure, then that would be cute. Doing it all the time, especially with random women, would seem too much like 'putting on an act' which would be unappealing. I mean, I don't mind too much if a guy holds open a door for me but that's still commonly done.


I don't mind fedoras, provided they're worn with matching clothing and you don't wear it ALL the time. I know some older men who wears them with tweed jackets and it works but fedoras can often look a bit desperate and trying too hard on a younger man (especially if worn with EVERYTHING)."

Me - ""Man, you're making this sound waaaay more easy than it sounds.""

Lady Friend - ""Look dude, I have a vagina. Do you even know what that fucking means? It's gonna get what it wants, always. But at the very least I have the decency to give back the pleasure it gets.

Me - ""Alright, well, prove it. Come here right now and suck my dick and I'll let you know how you compare.""

The point being that sometimes you meet people you can tell just about anything to. Every person is different--this is just a radical example of how dialogue can go, sometimes. I can tell this friend anything, but she'll usually tell me to just get straight to the nitty-gritty so she can judge both me and the girl. It's often pretty hilarious."

tallavery,Dogtraining,1390776831.0,"*EDIT: I am not a dog trainer, so I'm sharing my story only from the perspective of having a dog with similar issues.

My dog is also a rescue, with psychological scars that are taking a long time to iron out. He reacts with fear/aggression when someone bends down towards him. Though he's fine with people he knows well, he still prefers to be approached from the side. If I had to guess, I'd say his history included people crouching down to grab him and beat him.

He was so fearful when I first got him that it was impossible to walk through the house holding anything -- even something as small as a hairbrush. He'd cower and race for cover with his tail tucked. He finally got past that, and now (if I make sure my movements are not sudden) I can even work in the yard with a shovel or rake and he'll hang out right next to me.

Based only on my personal experience with my rescue pup, I'd say you'd be prudent to warn anyone around him that he has a fear response with faces down next to his. Protect him and the humans sharing his space by keeping him away from children and unfamiliar adults until such time as he gains confidence.

Two things I did with my boy that seemed to help quite a bit:

Fear response to crouching -- I kept yummy treats in my shirt pocket, and would randomly crouch next to him and feed him a treat. When I needed to sweep or work outside with larger tools, I'd hand him treats here and there. He doesn't seem to automatically associate objects in my hand with danger anymore, though if I surprise him with a sudden or loud movement, he scuttles for the nearest cover again.

Food guarding: I taught him the ""wait"" command. When I fill his food bowl, he knows to wait until I say ""ok"". When I bring home a rawhide or other toy, I give him the ""wait"" command and occupy myself with other things for a few minutes. This seems to have taught him that I am in control of the resources and that there is no need for him to be stressed about guarding them himself."

Free cash average over the last few years has been just over 2 billion.  Discount that back to the present at a rate of about 10% and you get a market cap of about 20 billion.  Their current market cap is 20 billion.  So with no growth they are fairly valued.  If growth turns out to be negative - which could happen in this industry - then they are overvalued.

Miliean,asoiaf,1390776874.0,"The biggest deciding factor on the release date of the world book have everything to do with the TV show and nothing to do with the books.

Right now HBO's show is super popular.  While we all expect the show to stay popular that's not a 100% guarantee.  So while the fans are tuning in GRRM, the studio and the publisher must take every opportunity to cash in.  While it would be better to relive the world book when more of the series was finished, the ideal release date for this would be when all the books are out.  So knowing that we know they want to put the book out there asap and not wait 3-5 years.

They can put out a part done world book right now to cash in on all the GoT fans out there right now.  Then when the series is finished, if it's still as popular as it is right now, they can publish another world book and sell it all over again.  

So if they are going to do a part done book, and they are, then clearly it does not matter so much how part done it is.  GoT has the popularity to move GoT related inventory.  That's all that matters."

Don't wear an actual dress shirt with jeans -the formalities are too different.  Shirt that button up in the front but are not meant to be tucked in are cut straight across on the bottom so that you don't have that hang in the back.

To answer the main question, the reason is that, in general, a tucked in shirt is formal and jeans are not.  If your  jeans are nice enough (clean, dark, single color) and your shirt is the right level of casual (rougher fabric like oxford cloth or patterned, generally with a pocket) then you can pull of the tuck-into-jeans.

A lot of fashion is about making sure you have congruent levels of formality throughout the outfit and it can be tough to get that right when you tuck into jeans.  "

First of all, yes, please go see a doctor. There is nothing more important than your health. 

You should not be worried about cancer, as it's a rare condition and there is no evidence that you may have it. There are many conditions that can cause pain and a palpable mass on breasts, and some of them are quite common and easily treated - some don't even need medication. Stay calm, talk to your parents and explain that you need to see a doctor.

Just to throw in a bit of statistics to help you calm down a bit: although Breast Cancer can give any type of symptoms, they are less likely to cause pain and other symptoms than benign conditions. Also, cancers are very rare on your age, and become more common after 35-40 years only.

It was the winter of my freshman year of high school. I had the nastiest acne known to mankind, thanks to a combination of puberty, and high school Texas heat football. My friend one time remarked years later ""/u/ryansouth21, I was afraid to sit across from you, I thought your face was going to explode all over me.""

After numerous trips to the dermatologist, the Dr. got fed up, and prescribed Isotetrinoin, aka Roaccutane, aka Accutane... 

Hell followed.

Yes, my acne got better, and I have never since gotten a severe breakout of any kind, and I rarely wash my face like I did in high school.

However, I was on it from January-June. It makes your skin super pale, one picture I had of me, I looked like The Joker, my hair looked green in contrast to my face.

When I wasn't pale white, I was lobster red. It makes your skin super sensitive to everything, especially the sun. I even tried putting Icy Hot on my sore back, and spent a few hours in the shower trying to cease the pain.

Also makes your skin extremely dry, I had constant nosebleeds, peeling of my skin, etc. 

It's been almost 5 years since, and now I'm beginning to have the symptoms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, which basically means I shit, a lot, and nastily too. Isotetrinoin has been known to cause this, along with suicidal tendencies.

Look at what the drug is, it's an acne medication, but also a drug used to treat cancer.

So take it at face value, if your acne is bad enough, take it, but discuss with your doctor all the possible side effects..

You need to touch base with this therapist/doctor frequently, possibly on a weekly basis, to calibrate your medication and monitor your mood. It will be tough at first, but hopefully your mental state will improve with time, medication, and therapy.

Assassin Creed 4's moments of stealth and sneaking around sucked.  There's absolutely no way to hide when you aren't, ""blending in"" and every guard automatically knows that you're trouble and to watch out for you.

ibbity,AskReddit,1390777393.0,"And yet he NEVER says ""I think that women should be allowed to retract consent after marriage,"" despite being point-blank asked about it multiple times. He dodges and avoids giving a straight answer. Combined with his stating that the marriage contract automatically gives a man the right to sex on demand, and that sex is the only thing that women bring to a marriage, and that men should be allowed to divorce their wives if the woman says no, this is interesting, to say the least. Also, [here he is](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1i3zvw/the_3_biggest_whores_i_know_all_parrot_the_same/cb1h2km) explicitly stating that 

&gt;They ask if it [spousal rape] should be ok. I say, it's not legal, so no. They say, but if it were legal. I respond, then it's not rape, it's contracted consent. 

I.e. spousal rape is ONLY a bad thing because it is illegal. Making it legal again, as it was in the past, would make it just fine. In other words, he doesn't think that there's a problem with spousal rape in and of itself, just the fact that you can get in legal trouble for it.

Someone said to him

&gt;Legality has nothing to do with rape.

to which he replied

&gt;Except for, ya know, the fact that rape references a crime. Which has quite a bit to do with legality.

I.e. he does not have a problem with rape *except* for the fact that it is against the law. (Specifically, one assumes, spousal rape, which is the type of rape being discussed, although I find it interesting that he did not see fit to qualify this.) He also seems to have a bizarre belief that the existence of the military proves that women should be disallowed to retract sexual consent ever for any reason or any length of time. He also defines marriage as

silverionmox,changemyview,1390777409.0,"&gt; Universities do not just take random people because of AA. The people who are admitted are just as qualified as their peers.

Then that would mean that, either, qualified people are being barred from going to university as a matter of course, which is a waste of human potential regardless of the race, or, that AA means that other people, who would be qualified otherwise, are barred in favor of those with AA privilege, which gives them a legitimate reason to oppose AA (because it turned out to be a blatant zero-sum power game rather than give people a fair chance).

&gt;The reasons and result are different.

The worst war criminals are those who are convinced they're working for the greater good.

&gt;Yes and no. There are many people trapped in a cycle of poverty because of racism. AA has been proven in fixing that. It has helped create the black middle class in America.

That's just an assertion. Unless you'd be able to produce a study that clearly demonstrates an exclusive causal link where AA made the difference between having a black middle class or not.

&gt;Only if the roles were reversed.

So you think that AA for women should be replaced by AA for men, since at this point more women than men are attending higher education?

&gt;If the person was racist beforehand, and thinks, ""Hey, there is something counteracting my racism. I guess I should be even more racist!""

You misunderstand. He should keep discriminating, because otherwise it would put his group at an objective disadvantage. You can't expect people to cooperate with something that gives them less than equal opportunity.

&gt;Your example is just for playing music.

You get the idea. Or not, if you want to be difficult.

&gt;Like I said, blind tests will augment the damage racism has caused.

It will cause people to be judged on their merits. If they aren't good for admission, then they simply aren't good enough. That's not a matter of discrimination, because it's impossible to discriminate in blind tests.

&gt;We've moved past this point. It is not that college admissions are racist, but that society is. This affects how people are brought up. Like I said, blind tests will augment the damage racism has caused.

Then we should do that eg. in the form of study groups that give them the help and study habits they can't get at home. If they can't pass a blind test, they simply aren't good enough. If a white person gets sick for half a year during his high school time, or is affected badly by the divorce of his parents, then he won't get AA either. We can't control everything in life, and sometimes shit happens. Part of being qualified for important jobs is being able to deal with shit. The reason why a higher education degree is in such high esteem is that people who have it have proven themselves more capable. Giving it away out of pity or guilt undermines that value, and worse, undermines the sense of social justice, that people who get important and lucrative positions have *earned* it.

&gt;Also, you never answered my question: do you believe that we should have implemented AA in the first place? If not, why?

I answered with what I think is a superior alternative.

.NET 4.0-- v4.0.30319 to be exact, winXP 32bit.  I also have .NET v3.5, v3.0, **v2.0.50727**, v1.1, v1.0 frameworks installed.  Dual core Pentium, 2gigs RAM, plenty of pagefile space on the HDD, blah blah blah, integrated graphics but SEIV runs fine so that shouldn't be an issue. 

I replicated the following errors using quickstart games-

&gt;screwed up map full dump-- During the savegame part of the turn sequence-  Happens during the first turn of every game.

    System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

^ ^ ^ I just read the bit about switching the focus and you were right.  Instead of hitting end turn and going back to FireFox, I just sat and let it run and the error didn't happen.  My maps are fine.

^ ^ ^ This is still happening even without the map corruption.

I just hit the ships tab after having built a ship and it works, the error I was getting must have been because I didn't have any ships yet.

On the design screen-&gt; create, the 'supply storage' attribute has a blank next to it, not even a 0, just a blank.  Adding supply storage does nothing, adding engines increases 'supply usage'.  On the main design screen it says 'supply storage 2500' after creating a ship with 5 engines.  The ship is built- on the ship's detail screen it says 'supplies 0%', however on the ability screen it says 'stores 2500 supplies'.  &lt;There is no way to know how many supplies a ship has once it is built and underway.

I don't know if you've ever read The Hobbit but its by no means an easy read, its convoluted and full of sub plots. A vast majority of the book would be useless on camera or would be simply pointless. Jackson is taking the important bits, editing the thing like it should of been years ago and then trying his best to do it justice while at the same time being a really solid film. There's absolutely no way he could of done the Hobbit in one or two movies, the book spends so much time world building that Jackson has to indulge in order for the story to feel like an epic fantasy.

The Lord of The Rings is pretty dense in its own right but its not even close to The Hobbit, not even in the same league. Shit, its a different genre of book."

Alright, I generally shy away from them if there's other people around because I get self conscious but I suppose that's the wrong way to think about it. I'll go in and hit the free weights more. 

Can you elaborate on a 5X5 program? I can't say I've heard of it. I would google it but I think it'd be nice to have a simple explanation before I try and work out exactly what they are.

I drink whole milk at least once a day in a hot chocolate, but can't say I'm a massive fan of it plain. I'll try and force myself though. Or just have more hot chocolates haha.

For snacks and bigger meals, what would you recommend? My mum tends to do meat or pasta most nights so I think I'm pretty solid on the protein for main meals over the week but for snacks I know I should cut down on the fat and try and get more protein from them.

Also would you recommend protein shakes? I don't know what the subs attitude is to them and I've never tried them but it's something I've considered.

Thanks for the advice though! :)

katiebug0313,AskReddit,1390778038.0,"It doesn't take rocket science to look at our molars and notice that they are flat. They are meant to grind down food. Our saliva contains digestive enzymes that are meant to break down food and absorb nutrients (which is only found in herbivorous animals and not in carnivorous). Also, the mere fact that our jaw can move side to side is another attribute that only exists in herbivorous animals. If you look at carnivores or omnivores, their jaws have very little range of motion, and can only move up and down. 

As for our incisors, many herbivores have incisors. Without them, it would be impossible to bite through skins of fruits and vegetables. 

Look at your hands. Do they look like the type of hands that would run, pounce, and rip apart another beings flesh? Or do they look more like the type of hands that would be used to pull an apple off a tree? We don't have carnivorous instincts. Look at a baby kitten (carnivore). They instinctually know to pounce, attack, and kill food in the wild. Look at baby humans. If they are hungry, they cry, and then start grabbing for inanimate objects to put in their mouth. Do you think a baby human would have the instinct to go chase down a running squirrel, or do you think it would make more sense for it to grab that Cheerio on the floor? "

ibbity,AskReddit,1390778089.0,"So do you actually NOT consider context a thing, or do you just believe that no two statements that a person makes in the same document should be assumed to have any relation to each other, or what? Because the things that I have posted here as statements by the author all occur within a couple of pages of each other. They aren't from opposite ends of the paper with nothing connecting them. They're all part of his main point in this section, which is that he believes that women who were ""merely"" forced or coerced into sex without their consent or against their will are not to be considered actual rape victims and should face consequences for claiming that they are. 

He defines ""date rape"" as a woman who regrets sex afterwards and falsely claims it to be rape---but he *does not consider forced sex against the woman's will to be rape, because he considers her will and consent irrelevant.* A woman who was forced into sex without consent, and who has neither a father nor a husband protesting the damage of his property *is not a rape victim according to this author,* because the only charge possible is that he violated her ""mere personal wishes,"" and the author *denies that this is a valid definition of rape,* and says that she should be forced to marry that man. 

Do you understand now, or are you still going to pretend that you don't get why anyone would accuse this WHITE SUPREMACIST THAT YOU KEEP DEFENDING of promoting the forced marriage of rape victims to their rapists?

RichardBehiel,AskReddit,1390778218.0,"3 Doors Down - Kryptonite

When I was a kid, about 7 or 8, my cousin Joe (or Joey, as we called him back then) and I were sitting in the back of my mom's car and this song was playing.  Joey knew all the words to this song and he was singing along passionately.  At a certain point in the song, he turned to me, air microphone in hand and sang ""If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?"".  And something about the way he said it stuck with me, because it was like he was really asking the question rather than just singing the song.

At the time, Joey was about 10 or 11, so a few years older than me.  He was insanely energetic, highly opinionated, and *always* getting into trouble, oh and he loved animals too.  I don't know how to describe him other than to say that he always did his own thing, and his own thing was awesome.  

This kid had the confidence of an adult and he wasn't afraid to get into all kinds of ridiculous scenarios (especially as a teenager), the kinds of things that you just have to shake your head and laugh at, like his exotic pets... he loved his pets.  He worked at PetCo and somehow ended up with a pet alligator (in California)... he had rattlesnakes too and had to go to the hospital for anti-venom at one point after being bit... classic Joe.  Oh and he was a Marine, had a beautiful girlfriend, and rode a motorcycle when he wasn't riding around in his Jeep with loud country music playing, stopping at the side of the road and pulling out a bow and arrow whenever he saw wild turkeys.  So naturally I thought that Joe was the ultimate badass, and I always looked up to him.

Things went downhill.  It would be inappropriate to share the details, but suffice it to say that his life went crazy.  Things were just falling apart and nobody really knew how to help.  I'm still convinced that Joe lived more in his 21 years than most people do in their entire lives, and he saved the lives of a few people with his organ donations.

About a week after the funeral, I was listening to the radio and Kryptonite came on.  It's strange, because I hadn't thought about that moment in years, but all of a sudden I saw him sitting right next to me again, singing along like he wrote the song. Fortunately I was all alone in my car so nobody saw the torrential downpour of tears when that line about going crazy came on.

Yeah Joe, I'll still call you Superman."

bubbish,AskMen,1390778308.0,"I've done laser hair removal for a double whammy of medical and cosmetic reasons. I could fill you in.

I did IPL. Basically they zap the roots with a powerful burst of light. The method relies on the contrast in color between skin and hair, so middle easterners are generally good candidates. Depends on how dark your skin is. When the root burns it sort of cauterizes the inside of the root, preventing a new one from ever growing. However, this only works if the hair happens to be in a certain phase of its natural cycle, so you won't hit all the hairs every time. This is why you need to go several rounds of treatment. Depending on if you want to just thin out or completely remove your hair, you will need something like 6-12 treatments. More if you're a sub-optimal candidate.

The roots you zap are permanently hairless but they told me that nothing stops new roots from forming, obviously. This is different depending on body area, but they told me that back and shoulders tend to slowly receive new roots until at least your 40's which is why it's not so perfect for young guys. You can treat these areas but chances are you'll get new hairs as the years go along. Not a problem if you can afford and stand repeated treatments. Pretty sure other body areas are fine though.

This method is a little painful. The sting packs a punch but it's also very very short so it's manageable. They use a machine with a special nozzle so they work their way around slowly, zap by zap. I became a little sore for a couple of days and smelt a little bit of burnt hair. The hairs sort of fell off after a few days, they just slid out and their roots were just gone. Trippy.

I wouldn't recommend anything but complete removal because the hair cycles are completely random. This means that after a partial treatment you might see patchiness in the area, there's no guarantee whatsoever that the spread of zapped and non-zapped roots is even. So make sure you **really** want the hair gone. Of course, you might luck out and get a nice partial where you just look less hairy, and you might even get some patchiness that isn't very noticeable. But it's a little risky and it depends on how your skin reacts.

As for your age, I think 21 is fine. Your body should be done furring you up by now.

I think that's all. I'd recommend you just go to a clinic and talk to them. They're very nice and helpful, and usually offer free consulting without requiring purchase. Mine also cost something like 100 euros per treatment and I think I went 4 or 5 times."

I would recommend taking a good look at the clothes you wear, do an update to something that looks timeless and mature yet comfortable.

Work on being happy first, then you'll be surprised at the attention you'll get as your mood changes. It works for me, but it's always a constant renewal process.

Sounds like a bad idea to me based on those three things...  Plus, first times are generally not stellar.  It's awkward and clumsy and there's a high probability that even with a partner you were totally into and had no reservations about and were feeling very safe with that you'd still probably have some issue like having trouble keeping hard or cumming too fast or other issues.  With a partner who you're comfortable with, that's the sort of thing that you can just laugh at afterward once your pride recovers.  With the kind of nagging alpha-type your friend sounds like and the fact that you don't trust his 'ho it could easily become something for you to get taunted about/for her to spread around if you really think she's the sort.

I'm not trying to say all sex has to be romantic and lovey-dovey and only with the person you intend to marry.  I'm just saying that it should, especially if it's your first time, be in a situation and with a person that makes you feel safe and comfortable."

I've NEVER enjoyed a bj when the woman didn't appear to be very into it, because that's what i enjoy. its possible he feels the same way and just let it build up inside of him until he exploded. Not to say he couldn't have handled the situation far better and in a healthier manner.

I just don't think its particularly fair to say, ""He should just be happy he got waked'n'sucked..""(open to suggestions).

Also getting into therapy takes a long while. And I'm looking for a therapist not to far away, but until I'm not a burden to myself anymore a long time will pass and I don't know if I'm able to handle it.

anon_na_mouse,pics,1390779188.0,"From ""Stalingrad, the Fateful Siege"" by Anthony Beevor: ""the thirty six year old Reuber, a theologian, was also a gifted amateur artist. he converted his bunker in the steppe into a studio and began to draw on the back of a captured Russian map - the only large piece of paper to be found. this work, which today hangs in the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church in Berlin, is the ""Fortress Madonna"", an embracing, protective, almost womb-like mother and child, joined with the words of St. John the Evangelist: 'light, life, love.' when the drawing was finished, Reuber pinned it up in the bunker. Everyone who entered, halted and stared. Many began to cry. To Reuber's slight embarrassment - no artist could have been more modest about his own gifts - his bunker became something of a shrine"" 
A year later Reuber would become one of the 91,000 Germans taken prisoner at the battle of Stalingrad, which saw around 1.97 million casualties. he would later perish in a Soviet prison camp, only 6,000 of the 91,000 men taken prisoner would ever make it back to Germany after the war. "

Hopefully the future will already be better for everyone and they can help improve it further.

With that said though, I don't really think my kids will be short. If they end up having growth hormone deficiency like I did, I'd definitely treat them for it because HGH deficiency is a valid health problem and does more than just affect your height. I was only treated for it briefly before there was some kind of issue with insurance or something - was too young to remember now, but regardless, that's why I'm so short.

madcowbomber,Fantasy,1390779624.0,"Funny story related to D&amp;D.  I learned to play in Bible college, with one of the deans, and fell in love with it pretty quickly.  I played it off and on through college and through my Air Force years, as well as the games based on it like Knights of the Old Republic, Baldur's Gate, etc.  

A few years later, while I was in seminary, I was interning as a chaplain at a hospital in Atlanta, and one of the wards I was responsible for was the NICU - an ICU for babies that are very sick, premature, etc.  I would visit there several times a week and got to know some of the staff (because I supported them as well as the families of the patients), and one nurse asked me one night to ""bless her hands"".  I didn't really know what she meant; doing formal blessings isn't part of my background or tradition, but I held her hands and said a prayer with her as she began her shift.  It wasn't till a few hours later that I realized that I had asked God to give her strength to get through her shift, dexterity for her hands as she cared for such small patients, and wisdom and intelligence for her mind to look out for any warning signs and make the right decisions to respond.  Basically I'd asked God to enhance her stats.  At no point until then had I even thought of D&amp;D at all whatsoever.

Funny thing is, I've never played a cleric.  I always liked tanks; the closest I ever got to a cleric was a half-orc Eye of Gruumsh."

Sahasrahla,eu4,1390779652.0,"Getting an heir (and the claim they have) is handled randomly behind the scenes and there's not too much you can do to affect it. Making your ruler or heir a general increases the chance of them dying, getting more royal marriages increases the chance of getting an heir, and I think one of the factions gives a boost to heir chance, but that's pretty much it. A lot of it is down to luck. 

Also, if you have a royal marriage with a country for a while you might end up in the same dynasty. This lets you get a casus belli to force a personal union if you claim their throne. You can still claim the throne of a country you have a royal marriage with even if you're not of the same dynasty, but you won't get a casus belli so you just have to hope to get lucky enough to get a union without a war. 

Since you're Confucian you can only get royal marriages with Confucian, Buddhist, Hindu, and Shinto nations so your options for getting thrones is a bit limited. Since so much of it is dependent on luck you might want to get some decent royal marriages early to increase your chances. If you look to India it's likely that Vijayanagar is quite big but a bit out of the way, so if you marry them now you have more chance of getting in the same dynasty of them. It might not pan out, but there's a chance you could easily get a good chunk of South Asia if things work out. 

Of course, with the faction system, you're usually very limited in the number of relations you can have before it becomes a drain on your diplomatic power. If you westernize and take the decision to form modern China it will remove the various detriments that come with the faction system. "

ST_Lawson,WaltDisneyWorld,1390779783.0,"We were there the week before Halloween last year.  A few recommendations:  

If you do the Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party, your ticket gets you into the park at 4 PM (I think, can't remember for sure, but it's around then).  What we did, and what worked out well for us, is to not get a park ticket for that day, instead we did a couple of hours and lunch at Downtown Disney, then back to our resort to hang out, rest and let the kids take naps, then got ready and went out for the party.  Saved us spending the $ for an extra park ticket that we wouldn't get a full day out of.  We also planned it out so that it was in the middle of our week there, so we were kinda ready for a half-rest day by then.

Pay attention to the Halloween party special stuff that they offer...there's certain villains that you can only meet during the party, as well as food and stuff that they only offer at that time.  There should be brochures available online when it gets closer to October (here's last year's: http://allears.net/tp/mk/mnsshp/2013-mickeys-not-so-scary-halloween-party-map.pdf)

The park is open late for the Halloween party (midnight or so, I think), so that's also where the afternoon naps help.  Our kids were able to stay up later because they had the afternoon naps.  They did parades at 8:15 and 10:30.  We waited until after the first parade to scope out a place to watch the evening events from (there was a light show at 9:15, fireworks at 9:30, villains dance party at 10:05, then the second parade at 10:30.  A lot of people left after the first parade at 8:15, or the fireworks (since they'd seen the first parade).  If you can make it work, there's fewer people at the second parade and it'll be easier to get a good spot to watch.

Since the Halloween party requires a special ticket it seemed somewhat less crowded.  You can plan to hit some of the generally more popular rides that evening when the lines are shorter.  I'd also plan another ""regular"" day at Magic Kingdom, so you can do everything else you want to do and have the ""regular"" MK experience."

jonfabe,HomeNetworking,1390779838.0,"One option that may work for you is to combine the two networks into one unified whole. You will have to change either (or both) of the address spaces to be in the same subnet, turn off one of the DHCP servers (most likely the one on the AT&amp;T gateway), directly connect a lan port on the ASUS to a LAN port on the AT&amp;T device, and then configure the remaining DHCP server to provide the correct gateway/dns information depending upon the device. If you wanted to, you could still use two separate IP address pools, as long as your subnet mask overlaps.


As an example of a potential address space setup, you could use 192.168.0.0/23 with 192.168.0.1 assigned to your asus router and 192.168.1.1 assigned to the at&amp;t device. Then your dhcp server would be configured to give your set top boxes addresses in the 192.168.1.2 -&gt; 192.168.1.254 grouping with a default gateway of 192.168.1.1 (the att device) and a subnet mask of 255.255.254.0. All other devices would then be assigned an address in the 192.168.0.2 -&gt; 192.168.0.254 set, with a default gateway of 192.168.0.1 (the asus device), and subnet mask of 255.255.254.0.  This will allow the at&amp;t devices to get the data from at&amp;t, your other devices to get on the internet, and all devices to communicate locally with one another since they are on the same subnet."

Lex Luthor is a Level 9 intellect, or thereabouts. Jor-El, the leading scientist of Krypton, was a Level *8*. You know how Superman refuses to hand over Kryptonian tech in an effort to not stifle human achievement? If Luthor dedicated himself, he could give Earth technology on par with Kal-El's homeworld. He could cure diseases, make colonization of other planets possible, and make scarcity a thing of the past.

He has given people superpowers, made a planet-destroying bomb small enough to place in a human, created armor that's physically comparable to Superman, created a Boom Tube while trapped on an uncivilized world, and has done so much more.

Eventually, in the 31st century, the population of the human race will be a Level 8 intellect, collectively. A thousand years from now, we will *almost* be at the level Lex Luthor could put us at within his lifetime. But in the DCU, a thousand years will pass before we're even close to the wonders he can accomplish.

But he just doesn't care. He'd rather ruin one superman than improve the lives of seven billion normal ones."

duffmanhb,worldnews,1390779906.0,"&gt; But the question was whether Kim made the most Machiavellian move, and my argument here is that taking the money and running would actually have been the best move. We're talking about maximizing power and influence. In Machiavelli's day, power was based on land ownership. Today, it's through currencies and financial instruments.  
Why bother leading over a country full of peasants when you can live even more opulently and comfortably in a modern society and investing that money into other instruments that bring you far more power?

I suppose you're right. But I think it's easy for me to say, ""Yeah, that' messed up and I'd take the money and run!"" But I've never really been in that situation. Being offered absolute power is a tempting thing to most humans. Realistically, I don't think many males would turn down an offer to rule their home country living like a king. 

&gt; The original comment was to say that both Machiavellian practice and morality were always on opposite ends. You can have both happen; it depends on output and intent. Much of it depends on what Kim Jung-un wants.

Note that a patch is required to play 4096x4096 and 8192x8192 sized maps (which gives the best result) and that an increased height limit patch makes for cool mountains like [these](http://imgur.com/yaPtvvD), which are [2450m high](http://imgur.com/T7QvxtS) with the height ceiling set to 50: a limit of 95 would accurately represent the tallest mountain in the alps, as it would be 4850 meters tall.

If she's deficient in one B vitamin, she is probably deficient in more than one of the B complex vitamins; it usually goes hand in hand. Who knows, if she was tested for it, she may have been on the low range of normal and her doctor either didn't tell her or downplayed its importance. And if she was on the border of being deficient, she may be (actually) deficient in another B complex vitamin, B6.

B12 will affect your overall motivation and energy levels, so it's a possibility, but I would be more curious to find out if she has normal levels of them B6 levels, which is a really big deal for regulating girly hormones and girly proteins and has a big impact on low libido and depression. (It's sometimes used to alleviate PMS; in conjunction with birth control prescriptions to help minimize the hormonal havoc loosed, and there was a study or an article or something I read (I can't find the source now :\) about how taking B6 supplement before the onset of hormonal acne (10 days before the period is supposed to start) would help prevent pimples from appearing.)

And the test for Pyridoxine deficiency (I think there's 2? 3?) isn't one they just give to everyone for their annual. The blood work done at an annual is usually really basic..make sure the blood isn't sludge, sugar is being processed, kidneys and liver are functioning, etc. At my last physical I had to *request* my vitamin D levels be checked :\

So there's that. Now the liver vs. red meat thing. Beef liver has 10x the amount of B6 than red meat per gram, and 61x the amount of B12 than red meat per gram. Wat?? Not to mention the Folic Acid which is a really big deal for everything reproduction (36x), magnesium which has documented aphrodisiac effects due to helping in the production and regulation of sexy hormones like androgen and estrogen (about the same concentration in liver as in red meat, actually :p)

To the reply that said they hated it, try buying liver of *calf*, the younger the cow, the milder the taste.
