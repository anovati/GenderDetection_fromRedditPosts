CaspianX2,politicalfactchecking,1390879286.0,"Personally, I tend to find it a bit tricky to check the bias of any source unless it's particularly striking one way or another. For example, Politifact has no problem with criticizing what it perceives as falsehoods from both liberals and conservatives.

Just saying ""they complain more about conservatives"" isn't necessarily proof of anything either - it is of course entirely possible that conservatives (or liberals) say falsehoods more often, and it is also possible that the fact-checker in question just happened to check more conservative claims, or that they checked more false claims for one side than the other.

This is why I personally tend to prefer a direct source - it is a far more reliable source than a fact checking website, though fact-checkers that include the source are often (but not always) more reliable simply because they provide you the opportunity to check them.

There is one surefire way to see that a fact checking website is full of crap, though - if they answer with an absolute affirmative or negative to questions that cannot possibly be answered. Anything dealing with motivations, or trying to determine the truth value of an opinion... and economic questions about cause and effect are a big one here too - because the way an economy works is so complex and involves so many different factors, it's rarely possible to say with 100% certainty that any one thing caused any other one thing.

We can say, for example, that the housing market crash led to the Great Recession, but asking just what caused the housing market crash leads to all sorts of different answers, none of which are necessarily wrong, but are each probably only a part of the answer, and people can't really agree on which parts are the biggest parts.

Another give-away is presenting things that are cherry-picked or out-of-context. For example, justfacts.com, the website in question here, posts the following information on their [National Debt Facts page](http://www.justfacts.com/nationaldebt.asp):

&gt;  * As of December 30, 2013, the official debt of the United States government is $17.2 trillion ($17,226,768,075,403).[1] This amounts to:

&gt;• $54,346 for every person living in the U.S.[2]

&gt;• $140,674 for every household in the U.S.[3]

&gt;• 102% of the U.S. gross domestic product.[4]

&gt;• 575% of annual federal revenues.[5]

This may all well be true... but it's completely taking the number out of context, since the national debt is not the same as individual debt, and it is most often expressed by comparison to GDP. But that's glossed over here. Everything else is facts presented out-of-context. Saying how much the national debt is per person, for example, is a rhetorical trick used to scare people, as Americans will never have to pay this debt in the same way that you would have to pay a personal debt.

They avoid comparing the two again until farther down in the page, where they cite a few token ""PhD Economists"" saying as much, and then present the following:

&gt;  * In the 40 years that followed the end of World War II (1946-1985):

&gt;• federal spending as a percent of GDP averaged 42% lower than the last year of the war;[67] and

&gt;• publicly held debt as a percent of GDP decreased by 72 percentage points.[68]

&gt;* Under current policy, assuming a sustained economic recovery during the 40 years that follow 2010:

&gt;• federal spending as a percent of GDP is projected to average 35% higher than in 2010 and over 78% higher than in the four decades that followed World War II;[69] and

&gt;• publicly held debt as a percent of GDP is projected to rise by 277 percentage points.[70]

What, no graph this time? And why do they jump from 1985 to projections ""during the 40 years that follow 2010""? Do their sources not have data for the 25 years in between? Let's look! [here](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/hist.pdf) is their source. And.... well, lookee there, those years *do* exist (look on page 144 of the PDF)! Yet for some reason this list of facts omits those years. As well as the years *before* WWII. And that's cherry-picking.

Why is it cherry-picking? Well, our national debt, as expressed as a percentage of GDP, was at its highest at the end of WWII - it was never higher than that. So naturally afterwards it could only go down. So the best place to cherry-pick a starting point to make the drop look its biggest is the end of WWII.

So what happened after 1985, then? Well, it started going up again. Right in the middle of the Reagan years. And continuing through the Bush years. Between 1981 and 1993, the national debt as a percentage of GDP *doubled. Then Clinton went into office and it suddenly slowed down again, and in his final years started going down once more. Then Bush took office and things gradually started going up again, and then leaped tremendously once the Great Recession hit at the end of Bush's term, a trend that continues to arc upwards in projections until 2013 and then goes down again.

This kind of thing might not look so good for those wanting to make it appear like Reagan and Republicans are thrifty and Democrats are big spenders. But stop your numbers midway into the Reagan years and start them up again when Obama took office (and then make everything about projections way off into the future) and it makes it easier to jump to the conclusion that Obama (or at least everyone after Reagan) was the cause of the huge jump in numbers. And it's not technically lying because they're not outright saying this... it's just omitting certain (kinda' important) facts.

Additionally, projecting economic effects as far out as 40 years is ridiculous, because any number of changes to the economy (not to mention to national policy) could happen in that time. Add to that the fact that much of current US budgetary policy is in response to the recent recession and as such is *intended* to be temporary, and it should be clear that such a projection is very misleading.

But that's just one example. It doesn't really demonstrate a bias for the whole website. But it does raise suspicion. Others here have posted similarly worrisome ""facts"".... and that paints a clearer picture.

Can we say for certain that the website is biased? Ehhhh, maybe. But we can absolutely say that it shows signs of numerous factors that bring its trustworthiness into question."

I've been using tablets for a decade now, and I recently purchased a Lenovo Helix, which has a built in wacom digitizer. It's an expensive laptop, runs windows 8 and if you have the appropriate Wacom Feel drivers installed, has pressure sensitivity in Photoshop. Thing is, I'm not particularly pleased with my investment, and I rather quickly returned to painting with my Intuos 5 medium tablet.

Since you are physically drawing right on the screen, any minor calibration issues become very apparent - and the Wacom Feel drivers are not great in that area. I can't comment on any of the Android alternatives though, but if you're going for Android, you're tossing Photoshop out the window.

Last of all, consider the fact that you're locking yourself into a device that was not specifically made for artists - a lot of these devices focus more on note taking (where the sub-par calibration becomes less of an issue). Furthermore, you'll be dishing out a lot of money for RAM and processor, if higher end specs are even available.

As it stands, active digitizers aren't quite there yet, and seem more like novelty items. You can absolutely paint with them, and it is definitely possible to get used to the calibration issues (or so I'd imagine), but it still doesn't stand up to the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of a regular Wacom tablet and a laptop loaded with RAM and a discrete graphics card."

DieMensch-Maschine,AskHistorians,1390879448.0,"I'll try to keep this concise.  First of all, having a professional affiliation (even as a graduate student) offers a certain amount of cred when attempting to access primary documents.  Most of the archives I had traveled to demanded a letter from my advisor/institution before they allowed me to put my grubby paws on their precious 300-400 year old manuscripts.  In addition, there are expensive/rare secondary materials that often cannot be easily/cheaply obtained by a non-academic historian.  Even when affiliated with a fourth tier institution, materials can still be ordered via interlibrary loan, all because that institution is willing to vouch for its students or faculty.  The instruction offered in a collegial academic setting is perhaps *the* difference between a professionally trained and an amateur historian.  In my experience, amateur historians are rarely capable of utilizing theory, historicizing, interrogating the source materials or taking an interdisciplinary approach.  Furthermore, many cannot distinguish between peer-reviewed, credible scholarly work and an ahistorical hatchet-job that some conspiracy nut may have written with a crayon on a roll of toilet paper, citing YouTube videos as source material.  In graduate school, such a diverse skill set can be acquired in a relatively efficient manner - and even then, it's still a baptism by fire with a sizable attrition rate.  To undertake such a task on one's own with no guidance from a whole body professionals (not just historians, but academics across varied disciplines and specializations) seems beyond herculean.  Finally, there's the benefit of networking.  When I was just entering graduate school, my advisor informed me that in order to be an effective scholar in my chosen field, I would not only have to acquire a series of dead languages, I would then have to learn the appropriate paleographical skills in order unlock period manuscripts, which were located in these and these particular archives. Fortunately, my institution offered a course the said dead languages, which I could then adapt to my research via a particular summer program, the director of which was a onetime colleague of my advisor.  The said director was then able to introduce me to other scholars who worked in a field that was closely related to my interest.  One of these invited me to a conference, where after a successful presentation (according to my academic peers), I was invited to contribute an article to a journal she just happened to be the chief editor of.  Once submitted, this article will be reviewed by other scholarly experts in my field before being published.  This ability (and means) to produce credible scholarship is perhaps the ultimate difference between a professional historian and an amateur historian."
Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1390879450.0,"It must vary from area to area.  The Walmart in the town where I work is incredibly hectic and stressful.  I'll also mention that the town that I work in is pretty much a welfare-abuse Mecca so you can imagine what sorts you get in there.  I encounter the same types at my workplace but I have a cool boss who doesn't suffer self-entitled bullshit and is likely to kick them out if they get out of line so they behave themselves when in the store I work for.  Anywho, back to Walmart... I only go there at night, it's a 24-hour one.  At night is much quieter and more relaxing; very few people and of the ones who are out, they are more reserved and generally more colorful characters.  They make for more interesting people-watching.

To clarify, the above may make it sound like I look down my nose at those collecting welfare, I don't.   I've no issue with people collecting welfare if they are using the system properly and genuinely are in need, in order to pull themselves to the point of not needing it if they are capable of such.  I also have no issue with my taxes supporting those who are truly disabled.  But there are a lot of shitheads around where I live who are doing things like faking disability at the doctor's and then going out mud-holing with 4-wheelers and hiking on the weekends, they are the same types who come into the store I work at and hassle me for crap they aren't entitled to or blame me for mistakes they made with the product or livestock.  If you have so few scruples that you are cheating the tax and disability system, it seems to follow that you are the sort who tries to cheat individuals and businesses.  Fortunately, my boss has a powerful B.S. detector and doesn't tolerate people trying to cheat us.  She bans them from the store if they are being horrid.

Its very common knowledge that murder is bad. Sex is so much more of a grey area and especially regarding consent. A 30 year old could very easily manipulate a 14 year old into sex. Fault there is the 30 year old not the 14 year old. Big difference. 30 year old knows its wrong. 

Quick edit- I believe that current stat rape laws are absolutely idiotic the way they are written.  However, I do believe that something like 14/30 or whatnot is something that should be illegal.

Edit 2: I guess you guys aren't understanding my hyperbole. Most children understand that death is bad. Maybe not all five year olds but in general they will understand murder."

Should I just use the 5's and 2.5's and just add more of them?

2) I've been doing the routine for 2-3 weeks and while I'm noticing better size and grip, my wrist curls aren't getting any easier. My gym has smaller barbells and I use the smallest(20lbs), for palm-down wrist-curls I get about 10-15 reps each set and palm-up wrist-curls I get 15-20. Is this lack of progress normal? 

3) For wrist-curls, how far should my wrists flex toward my torso? If 90 degrees is completely vertical, my wrists get to about 75 degrees, is this normal or should it be higher?"

You know what? Your tastes change. You learn to enjoy your new way of eating. Food tastes so much better when you're actually hungry."
pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390879732.0,"Some friendships don't stand the test of time and hardship, but the ones that do bring a fulfillment that makes it worth it to try.  If you reject the notion of friendship because they can fail, you seem to be shaping your life around a fear of getting hurt. A lot of people have a similar reaction when they suffer heartbreak; they decide it's easier to just reject everyone instead of standing the chance of getting rejected again. It's a crippling way to live. Most people recover from it and they do eventually find love that makes the struggle worth it in the end.

Chances are high that any girlfriend you have now will not be the one you marry or grow old with. You even acknowledged that yourself. So you must know intuitively that getting a girlfriend can end in being hurt. Does that make it not worth trying?

It sounds like you expect your girlfriend to be your only friend and fill all your needs. That just doesn't sound healthy for either of you, for a number of reasons. 

It's normal to be curious about what having a girlfriend is like, but that is an immature reason to seek one. It's a common outlook for someone who is inexperienced, so I'm not trying to criticize you, but I do think it's immature. 

Personally, I would not date a guy who had no friends. There is a big difference between having a couple friends versus having none. It would be especially disconcerting to me if he told me that the reason he had no friends was because he didn't care about building friendships. That is a lot more of a red flag than if a guy said he just had been unlucky with friendships. "

portugalthephilosoph,politics,1390879907.0,"Dems are making gains in Texas because of the Hispanic populations. Have you seen Davis's polling among Hispanics? She's losing to Abbott 38-43. That's terrible for a Democrat in Texas. Want to know why she is polling so terribly with Hispanics? The abortion issue. And this is a big bellwether for national Democrats on this as well. Hispanics are a largely Catholic population, and are for the most part vehemently opposed to abortion. This is a losing issue for Dems amongst Hispanics, and if they want to keep that demographic they will have to adjust their messaging. 
Not to mention that Davis is losing to Abbott by 19 points in the 18-35 age group. Isn't that supposed to be the winning demographic for this argument? 

For a Democrat to win in Texas they need to do 2 things: win independents by a decent sized margin, and get double digit crossover support from Republicans. Right now Davis is falling short on both of those fronts. With independents she's managing only a tie at 44%. And she's winning over only 6% of Republicans, far less than the share of Democrats who say right now that they lean toward Abbott.

You can look at trends all you want, but the polling isn't keeping in line with that. The messaging change in Texas has hurt the Dems there. The state party used to be extremely moderate, and borderline conservative. But since the Davis revolution, they've suddenly been perceived as much more liberal. This does not help them in Texas, and they may lose a couple key demographics for several more cycles as a result."

It's difficult to determine factually whether or not something is ""biased"", however, it's a bit easier to determine if a website is ""not completely honest"".

Users here (including myself) have noted multiple instances of cherry-picking, facts presented out-of-context, and speculation based on unrealistic assumptions in projections in *multiple* sections of this website. I have not seen any strong arguments to refute these findings (or any arguments at all, for that matter).

As such, unless someone comes up with a good counter-argument in the next few days, I'm marking this one as ""confirmed"", inasmuch as it is an untrustworthy source that is indeed ""not completely honest"", although I make no comment as to whether or not this means the website is ""biased""."

IngwazK,mylittlepony,1390880022.0,"Im going to chime in on this as well.  I had never been to a con of any kind before (not to mention not taking a vacation in 5+ years) so i decided to go to bronycon last year.  I was originally supposed to go with some friends, but they all ended up bailing on me for various legitimate reasons.  I ended up traveling with some people i had never met before and only knew through email (which was pretty scary bit i didnt get murdered) and rooming with other people i only knew through email and had never met before (no murders but one really really drunk underage bastard).  I went into it honestly expecting it to be a bit of a spaghettifest.  Yes, some stereotypes were on display but honetly it was only a small peecentage.  Overall, i had an absolute blast.  The most fun ive had in years and even before it was over, i was thinking about how i would be able to go in 2014.  

I would recommend travelling and rooming with friends and doing things with them while there, as while i did personally know one other person there, he was in his own group of friends and i didnt want to invade.  Bronycon is a big con, so its more about seeing all the amazing things, but having a few friends to see it with makes it even better.  

Also, go out and explore the area a little.  Gp to the harbor, find the tir na nog restaurant and buy a nog burger (its 16$ but its 16$ of absolute deliciousness).  Be ready to spend money, its your weekend, leave it without regrets.  It was just so much fun.  

A small wprd of warning though, if at all possible, arrive a day early and get your con badge taken care of.  I arrived just beforw the line got super bad and only had to wait an hour.  One of the guys i traveled with waited 3.  

In short, would i recommend it?  If youre looking to just go crazy, see and hear a lot of awesome things and just have fun, yes, 100%."

Vroonkle,subaru,1390880086.0,"I think you hit the nail on the head in the opener; I don't think its possible to conclude who STI aimed their WRX at either. When STI first started out they were probably excited about an opportunity to dream big. They're a group of engineers who clearly love cars, and they had a large corporation to back them financially. Why not just shoot fort he moon? Similar to other automakers performance divisions: it seems like they just wanted to test their platform's limits. Nowadays, I think Subaru is aiming at a larger market, which usually spells heartbreak for the diehards. Of course, that only speaks to the US Market segment. It's an import after all, and they might just be sick of dealing with our regulations; the STI is a proven name at this point. They can ride this through a couple years just for profits before buckling down, or cutting it loose. "

Drew Brees: Probably although I doubt he's a first or second ballot HoFer
Larry Fitzgerald: He needs 2000 yards just to crack top 10 and there are better receivers who haven't made it in yet.
Adrian Wilson: I don't think he was dominant enough to make it in although I could very well be wrong.
Troy Polumalu: Maybe. He still needs several more good years. Definitely not a first ballot HoFer.
Ed Reed: Probably several years after eligibility.
Aaron Rodgers: Needs to play at his current level for a while longer. Second ring seals it.
Marshawn Lynch: Can't see this happening.
Calvin Johnson: If he has longevity I can see this happening. His injuries over the past two years make me doubt he'll last long enough to rack up enough yards.
Andre Johnson: Not too sure. He has a lot of yards but he's done it in an era where yards are easy to come by. To make it in as a WR these days, I feel like you have to be as dominant as Megatron or Fitzgerald in his prime for most of your career.
Brandon Marshall: He has a long way to go. I feel like he kind of squandered the beginning of his career.
Antonio gates: Maybe if he has another two good years. It would be a long wait though.

loyyd,AskWomen,1390880145.0,"Wow, this comment is so hate-filled. Unrequited feelings suck for both genders and those who feel entitled definitely don't deserve sympathy but I think it helps to understand the perspective of people in this situation. 

There's no guidance for young men as to what they should do to display romantic interest. I'm not using hyperbole here; if you don't have a male role model that will help you, there's nothing to tell you what to do (media is the worst; movies and shows especially). But unfortunately there exists the oft-repeated saying, ""women like nice guys."" What that should instead say is women tend to value niceness and kindness in their partner; these traits play no part in the initial attraction. Guys who are in this position don't know this though because feedback is so rare and women are told to be non-confrontational with regards to romantic pursuits. They won't learn until failure finally drives them to learn what they've been doing wrong and at this point it tends to feel hopeless.

You get those who cry out ""friendzoned!"" when they find a woman attractive but don't know what they need to do to properly show interest and develop attraction. Instead they are nice, kind, they might spend money, and possibly ask the woman in question on a date but, as is incredibly common because this is the wrong approach, there's no attraction on the woman's part and the feelings are not mutual. They've been following advice they've heard their entire life, especially from women, and it's not working for them. Tell me why that would not be frustrating and confusing? 

They do have much to learn and they aren't entitled to anything but please try to understand their perspective instead of being so hateful towards them."

As for good dates...you are sixteen, you are likely pretty limited. Other activities could be bowling, mini golf or other such activities. 

Only so far as *both* of you are comfortable with.

That depends on if the girls you are dating want you to be exclusive or not. There really is nothing wrong with casually dating a couple of people **but** keep in mind that it is best to keep those kinds of relationships super causal. If you want to have any kind of physical relationship in addition to the dating (even something as simple as kissing) it would likely be best to keep it to just one girl at a time. Since most girls would find the idea of you kissing other girls (or more) as unacceptable. "

Of course once he was admitted, they watched his oxygen levels and wouldn't let him go until he could be off oxygen and still have good enough O2 saturation, but I was fine with that; it was certainly better than being at home not sleeping because I couldn't know if he was okay.

Tumblrites are more prone to accuse you of being subhuman in some way if you disagree, in addition to proposing theories that are not only impossible but deny the actual experiences of the people they claim to stick up for. Claiming everyone was a pansexual PoC denies the reality of the discrimination that such people actually experienced at those places and times; for example, if a PoC could be a renowned composer, why didn't all PoCs just do that?

My 10-year-old self would be shocked about the things I've done and things I've experienced, both good and bad. She (I) would be disappointed and even maybe a little judgy (as much as a 10-year-old can be), but in other ways, really proud. I think the main feeling, though, would be shock/surprise. And then she (I) would have tons of questions, at least partially because 10-year-old me was super annoying and liked to ask a lot of questions. At age 10, I was fairly sheltered. 

I think here are the top five things I would be shocked by, in no real order:

1. I have my Master's Degree, as well as probably some surprise as to what my degrees are in (good shock).

2. I was raped (bad shock).

3. My relationship with my ex (bad-ish shock). 

4. I'm not married or really close to it. Also, I had sex before marriage, have had sex outside of a relationship multiple times, etc. (bad in my 10-year-old mind, good now). 

5. My general appearance. I have boobs, lol. I have a fairly attractive face, and a good body (good shock! I like to think I turned out well).

She's a badly-dressed but still relatively pretty girl who catches the eye of a serial-manipulator and generally abusive man with more baggage than a 747. He is attractive mostly because he is broken and unattainable. And nothing is more attractive to a self-conscious, needy woman than getting an unattainable man and being needed; Ana ""saves""   Christian from his own emotional mess and crappy past and wins the heart of a man that has never loved a woman. It's all just emotional porn. 

My point is that it just doesn't seem to be quite the same as in ""Modern Family"" or any other tv show, where a goofy, pudgy, unattractive man (with or without a good job) has a considerably sexier wife, and they're super in love and everything is all fine and dandy. 

I would love if 50 Shades inspired American networks to start producing *quality* productions where this is the case.

FireSail,IWantToLearn,1390880842.0,"Place most people can improve on are texture of the food (specifically veggies) and presentation. Hard to talk about flavors without getting specific about individual recipes. 

Prep work is huge - vegetables should be uniformly chopped/sliced, it looks professional. Also know that texture/cut should follow some logic. If you're making a pot pie, dice your carrots so that they're of comparable size to your peas instead of very long slices cut on a bias or something. Similarly, if you're making a ramen, chop your cabbage into long ribbons that will catch with the noodles, rather than big blocky chunks. Stuff like that.

Throw a pat of butter at the end of everything.

Use square plates. Drizzle sauces or dash them across the plate with your spoon. Stack things high, rather than spreading them out along the plate. Know when to garnish with what - basil chiffonade, chives, parsley, mint leaves and powdered sugar for desserts.

Get used to par-boiling, blanching, searing, resting, and all sort of other ranges of cooking besides simmering something for hours or frying it on high.

Sauces matter. Learn the French mother sauces. Know how to make a roux. 

Don't over season. Don't over-cook. Number one crime with vegetables is over-cooking. If a vegetable can be eaten raw, it's better to err on the side of under-cooking so that it retains its color and crunch. Only veggies you should ""worry"" about cooking all the way through are roots like yams, turnips, potatoes or certain gourds and squashes like zucchini, eggplant, and pumpkin.

Practice cooking key cuts of meat - pork &amp; lamb chops, steak, chicken (all parts). If you can't grill or pan fry something right, stick to long roasting/crock pot of cuts that take well to long slow temps and are hard to ""over cook""

Fish cooks faster than you'd think. Also, mussels are surprisingly easy and cheap yet because of the European connotation, have a flair of sophistication to them. You can literally dump a sack of mussels into a pot with some butter, white wine, shallots, tomatoes, and cream and have something that looks professional. Just make sure to stick some french bread in there. 

If you have grains like rice or quinoa or a food that's otherwise made up of tiny individual units (like corn and black bean salsa), put it in a ramekin or some sort of container, put your serving plate face down on top of it, then flip. This will give you a shaped mound, rather than just a lumpy cyst-like mass.

LintPlastic,todayilearned,1390881111.0," I have a Dachshund and people next door have five pits. They always come over to see us when we go outside they are very friendly and always love to be played with. But my fatass lazy winnie dog fucking hates them and everything but us and his bestfriend Bailey the cat. We have another dog and he is  chained up (winnie dog is not chained up) and when he is off his chain my winnie dog gets so mad. He wont attack or make a fuss but he has this , ""God damn it. I hate everyone and everything."" Look until the dog is chained back up.



He even screws with our dog in the chain by running towards him so the dog will chase him and then he runs back out of reach to turn and stare at the dog. But with the Pits my winnie dog is always trying to attack them and it is scary. They could easily get into our fenced in yard and kill him. Most don't attack but few do when he tries to get them through the fence. Scares me bad... one bite and he is dead from them. One Pit already got in out yard by digging because she wanted to play with out other dog but luckly my dog was busy playing with my niece. Our other dog isnt a winnie dog and doesn't fight or fuss bout the pits. The Pits want to play but there is my jerk of a winnie dog going after them and course it pissies them off.

:/ my Lil Man is a sweet heart though... when he knows you. He loves cuddles and licking and playing and is so silly and loopy. But He'll attack anything and kill anything if we don't properly introduce him to them. yet those Pitbulls will lick any stranger they see. "

Well I thought it was stupid to have a $100+ hockey jacket and not watch hockey. It was the 1993-1994 season so I fell in love immediately. I lived and still live in kern county during all of this. 20 years later and I still love the sharks. 
puaSenator,TheRedPill,1390881330.0,"&gt; If you need a subreddit and philosophy to understand male/female attraction then you've got bigger problems.

This sentiment has always irked me. Not much of our abilities in modern society are natural instincts, especially when it comes to complex social dynamics. You OBVIOUSLY have to discuss and understand these interactions to excel and get better. Why is sexual strategy discussions always looked down on by some, while things like discussing corporate politics, leadership, and how to connect better with people, okay to discuss? These are very normal things. If you've ever worked in a corporate environment, you've probably been to some retreat that teaches you how to be an effective, friendly, leader. And no one gives a flying fuck, and in fact, encourage it. But soon as you discuss sexual strategy it's, ""OMG losers trying to figure out how to get laid. OMG, if you don't know how to do that, you're pathetic!"""

It's like when ESPN has an article about whether a team is 'elite' like that's a well defined, falsifiable term.  Kevin Durant is playing better than anyone else this season, and making a bigger impact on the court than anyone else this season.  He's become the most talked about player with great performances on a near-nightly basis, on a team that keeps winning despite missing one of its (and the league's) best players.

iamtryingtobegood,TrollXChromosomes,1390881475.0,"I didn't know what the fedora persona is until I read the linked thread.

&gt; I'm talking about a guy that wears a fedora (or maybe any other hat) and does things like tipping it to you, says things like ""m'lady"", stands up when you enter the room or exit the table, kisses your hand, etc.

I mean, there's nothing wrong with any of these things save that it's a bit quirky, and some people might be turned off by the quirkiness, but I think the real problem is that he thinks these florid gesticulations constitute a dateable personality. These things are on the level of minutiae. I had an ex who used to call me ""my sweet."" I found it creepy at first and cute later on, but he didn't build his personality around the choice of an antiquated-sounding pet name. 

Most people, I daresay, date on the basis of much less trivial things, such as actual personality traits, common interests, physical attraction, values etc. For instance, kindness, a sense of honor, trustworthiness, empathy etc are all (vaguely described) personality traits of some sort. Tipping a fedora and saying ""m'lady"" are gesticulations that furiously wish to demonstrate some kind of charming personality, but actually amount to very little substance except an obsession with acting like a quirky gentleman. And that can get creepy real fast. So when this guy thinks he is being very charming and whatnot, he actually leaves the impression that he is overcompensating for a poor personality. Which may likely be true, given his motivations for doing the fedora thing in the first place."

One of the answers simplifies the US gambling laws.  I'm not sure about other countries.  But it states that for gambling to occur you also need a prize.  And by the law IP is probably not considered to have any value at all.  RP might have some value.

Also, rules in high school is totally different from the anti-gambling laws."
promptly,RandomActsofMakeup,1390881642.0,"One of my favorite memories happened when I was 18 years old, right before I left for college. Just a warning, this is a super cheesy story! haha

So at the time, I was infatuated with a guy that I had been crushing on for a pretty long time. I randomly visited him late at night, and he asked me if I wanted to stargaze with him. We were laying on his lawn, looking at the stars, and just shooting the breeze with random conversation. Since we had just finished school, we were talking about different classes we had taken...one of them being Spanish. He was good at Spanish, but me, not so much. He started telling me how much he liked me in spanish, touching different parts of me and telling me what he liked about them (""your hair is beautiful, your eyes are beautiful, etc""...I'm guessing he didn't really know any other adjectives in spanish :P). He then touched my lips and said in Spanish how much he wanted to kiss me. I looked at him confused (again, terrible at Spanish, no idea what he had just said). He asked me, ""You *really* don't know what I just said? I said no, and then he responded, ""OK...let me show you."" And then he leaned down and kissed me. I remember being so giddy that I just blurted out, ""Again, again!"" because I was so ecstatic! It didn't end up working out with him, but he was a great guy. Another thing he did was make me a mix CD, and used the titles of all the songs to write me a letter which was the back of the case. Seriously, I felt like a princess when we were together.

I'd love to try a blush from the first picture. I only own one blush color and I think I need to start expanding! The hair powder I'm unsure about, but only because I have no idea what it is really! lol time to Google...

Only problem is that the boot may not end high enough if you're in a place where there's a lot of snow. Anything above 8""+ inches of snow may find its way in your boot unless you secure the boot opening better.

In terms of how bulky the sole is. It is thick, but it doesn't ruin the office the look, it's definitely a better option than Timberlands for an office look. I am in a more casual government office, and a lot of days I don't switch my Katahdins for my office shoes and they're fine, especially if you wear cuffed jeans with them.

It's also a food I eat as a quick snack and at times I'm feeling faint/starving to get something in me immediately, so I'm not going to fuss with creating strings to dangle into my mouth. I'm sure your daughter is aware of the health benefits and time efficiency of this method and has chosen her string cheese eating habits with careful consideration. "

dublos,OkCupid,1390881881.0,"Cleaned up you should be your primary picture and lose the picture with the mirror shades as soon as you can replace it with a better full length picture.   NEVER hide your eyes, and absolutely never make that your primary picture.

I'd find a willing friend and try to replace all three with new pictures.  For all that Cleaned up you is the best picture of you the fact you're looking at the image on your screen and not the camera is off putting.

Why is being an introvert and having high standards for yourself a bad combination?  This is unclear from your intro.

Your self summary is sounding like a shut in who has no interests or life.. you apparently have a job that requires you suit up, what is it?  What do you want to do with your life after college?  Did you come from a big town, little town, what major have you selected, something that actually lets the reader understand you even a tiny bit.. 

What I'm doing with my life.. AWESOME.. so many good things and all buried in the section that no one will get to because they clicked away after reading you're a shut in that needs someone to show them how to have a life.  move some of this up!   You Have a house to remodel and you're only 20, that's very notable!   What are some projects you've completed, what are you working on, is the place a shambles or could you have a date over to feed them or at least have a nicer place to hang out than a dorm room?

I'm really good at.. NOW, NOW you mention you're pre-med?!?!?  Dude quit hiding the good stuff!  Expanding on the carpentry here is good, but definitely highlight it in the self summary first.  Again mention WHAT projects, do you have one particular part of your current remodel you're most proud of?

Favorites good.. except for food, that's not favorites, that's things you don't like.   Move those down to AFTER listing some foods/cuisines that you do like.  Always the positive before the negative and the positive should be longer than the negative so keep finding positives till it's balanced that way.

Typical Friday.. your current self summary sounds like you want someone to drag you out partying and this section makes it sound like partying is a bad thing.   Clarify *What* sort of things you want to be taken out of your comfort zone to try in your message me if, lose the mention of partying from here.. again the positive, what you DO do, not what you don't do.

Private thing.. Valid perhaps, but not something I can speak to.. from what I know of what girls find attractive you should go clean shaven or let it fill in more.  Right now your facial hair is kinda scraggly which is good in some contexts, but in a job where you're suited up?  Meh, wait for feminine critique that is from someone who might actually be in your target market.

Message me if.. HERE is where you talk about what types of things you want someone to pull you out of your comfort zone to try.   

Right now it reads something like ""I'm so shy I'm never going to message you so you'd better message me and expect me to take a while to work up the courage to reply.""

How about message you if you want to see the awesome project you're going to tell them about in your what I'm good at section?

You're totally right, the storyline is the main problem because you could argue most of Daryl's character right now comes from the events that transpired with the group, so placing him in the future (i.e. without the guidance of the group) doesn't fit in that sense - it wouldn't be the same Daryl, and messing with one of the fans' favorite characters can be dangerous.

Walmart is competing with every other major retailers, and it's doing this by reducing it's prices. It's a win win for us - The customers!  


*Or are you saying that you randomly walk into a Walmart and Target and you are looking for a TV without doing ANY form of research, and you'd end up with a better TV from Target. *

**DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW RIDICULOUS THAT ASSUMPTION IS?**



Walmart is definitely NOT any worse than Target. Yes, Target has better clothes, but that's just about the only advantages they have over Walmart. Walmart carries a wider variety of consumables AT ANY GIVEN TIME.

Oh, and Target is owned by a frenchman. WalMart is owned by Americans. Way to support your country. (I'm assuming this based on how convinced you sound by your post. If you aren't American, Ignore this)

For reference, I come from a upper middle class family, and I never am ashamed of shopping at walmart. Their prices are GREAT and as a consumer, it's only logical to shop where I benefit the most.

panthera213,talesfromtechsupport,1390882150.0,"I live in Canada and there was a creepy guy in some of my undergrad classes. We all thought he was capable of shooting up the school. We were in lab once and my lab partner (and best friend) was having a bad day and exaggerated ""uggghhh, I just want to die"" and the kid creepy whispered to her ""so go kill yourself then"" totally stone-faced. We left the lab after that. A few days later I was telling a friend about this before I was about to meet my lab partner to finish the lab we left, when she texted me that there was a man with a rifle on campus and they were sending people home. I freaked the fuck out and thought it was this guy. Turns out it was actually just another friend of mine carrying a bike seat across the bowl and someone saw him through a window and panicked (this was a few weeks after the Virginia Tech massacre).

Not saying it's the only truth, just presenting it as one possible thing to believe. My parents did that, and haven't gotten upset that I've chosen to not be religious now that I'm grown. 

I'm glad they gave me fantasy novels, science kits, and a children's bible, and didn't force me to go to religious events or even to church. I haven't been baptized. My mom even let me buy a Wiccan teen book to explore alternative religions when I was like 13. But they're still religious people. 

As a kid, I thought of the bible as just another story book, and my parents didn't really try and correct me. We didn't talk about it, they didn't make me read it. I read it because I wanted to, on my own time. It was just made available to me. I tried church events with friends now and then, and I'm ultimately glad that I have knowledge of religions.

 I am a straight guy but my three best friends are all females. Only a couple of my fraternity brothers are in the same ballpark in terms of emotional intimacy. As the guy in our circle, I'm usually the stoic rock/shoulder to cry on/problem solver, and they often help me with my girl troubles.  I actually friend zoned two of them before they did for me.

Point is: this is what I ineffectively attempt to communicate when others ask about our odd posse.

Many don't understand just how the mechanics of the friend zone work, and wonder why I tease myself with it. It's thrown a wrench into previous relationships because the girl failed to understand this (I am not always the most articulate), and have gotten jealous as a result.

The friend zone is a weird place with weird rules and strange emotions, but it can be extremely rewarding. I wish more guys would realize this."

I assumed teams usually have more than a 50% chance of winning.  This means that most people would gain IP.  More IP would be injected into the system.

Think of the field as split in two halves. 


Offensive


_________


Defensive



This is how the teams line up.  You can switch it around anyway you want as long as 7 men on offense are on the front line. Offensive on top, D on bottom. 


Running back (runner)

Full back (runner and blocker)

Quarterback (thrower)

Linemen (blockers) in the center and receivers (catchers) on the sides. 
____________________________


Defensive linemen in the middle and cornerbacks on the sides (they guard the receivers)


Linebackers- the second line of defense

Safeties- the third and final line. They usually provide backup and cover the catchers that run deep. 



Linemen are the tall, muscular and fat guys. They do the dirty work and fight at short distance like a constant scrum. Linebackers are still large, but are more mobile than the linemen. The safeties and corners are usually the lightest and quickest to cover the quick receivers trying to catch the ball.

In fact, we're significantly less healthy even when controlling for healthcare, diet, and essentially all other individual health practices and risks (including smoking, etc).  You know what the difference is?  Social inequality.  I'm dead serious: All the evidence so far points to the inescapable conclusion that all that individualism you love so much *is literally* ***killing you.***"

And the fact that the team is just so damn good on paper, made it seem nearly impossible.  The Spurs came so tragically close that betting against the Heat isn't crazy.  They still have a great chance to win, of course, but I'm not sure they're my favorite to win, which they were in the two preceding years."
another30yovirgin,AskWomen,1390882728.0,"That seems a bit unfair. Yeah, a lot of the time, men are looking to meet women to date. Is that really such a terrible thing? Now granted, it's not great to just be *friendly* to someone you want to date. It doesn't let her know that you're interested. But men fail to show the proper romantic level because they're shy or have trouble expressing themselves. It's not because they have some sort of malicious intent. 

So look at the guy's perspective: he doesn't know how to show her affection properly. He's trying to show it in ways that he thinks will work--by being kind and maybe generous, etc.--but he is struggling to get the point across. Then she figures out that he's interested, and generally that's when she takes a big step away from him and starts treating him like he's poison ivy. Maybe he doesn't get that he didn't express his interest correctly. And in the mean time, he gets told he's not a good friend and that he's the bad guy, when his feelings for her had good intentions.

It's a really easy mistake for a guy to make if he's not experienced in relationships. It's definitely a mistake, but it doesn't necessarily mean he's a bad guy."

Above average. I grasp concepts easily, I'm a fast tactile learner, resourceful and adept at improvising.  I sight-read music on the piano without preparation well, which suggests excellent short-term memory.  I'm great at languages.

**Health &amp; Fitness**

I'm not sure how to rank this one.  I have chronic ailments (such as asthma) but eat healthy...my diet is above average in nutrition.  I'm at a weight I feel great in, most definitely a minority.  Should I say I have well-below average weight?  That sounds wrong. But I could use some strength training.  Unless given a weapon, I will be a below average warrior.  I also walk much more than the average American.

**Emotional Maturity**

Average.  I used to be below average.  I was unable to read people, unable to relate to people, unable to communicate well, and unable to control my temper during trying times.  I am much better now, but there is still a ways to go.

**Life in General**

Although I was below average in wealth for most of my life, until recently, I feel I've lived an above average life so far..in terms of experiences.  I travel when I can, I have lived in other countries.  These experiences enrich my life, however it is common for Americans not to travel internationally (I hope this changes!).  I have an above average self-esteem for a girl and ""media goddesses"" do not bother me, however I think most people sadly have rock-bottom self-esteem so this is not a huge feat.  I have a career in the field I studied in school, which is not something many of my high school class can say.  It's not something a lot of my college classmates could say either.  I have a great boyfriend, and a generally good relationship with the various branches of my family."

enna_,weddingplanning,1390882813.0,"Let me preface my answer with this: Mother's day is a horrible time for florists-- but not completely impossible, you just might have to have extreme amounts of luck. Just know that a florist A.) Probably wont be able to set up for you (which is something most florists will do for receptions), and B.) will be extremely busy for the entire week prior. Florists usually like to push Mother's Day deliveries for the entirety of the week before the actual date to lessen or eliminate any actual MD deliveries, so that entire week can be insanely busy for them. I'm really sorry that your wedding had to be on this holiday- but I am sure it will be wonderful regardless!

**Here are my answers!!:**

1.) 
**Part A:** Prices of flowers dramatically increase for Mother's Day, sadly, especially roses and lilies (in my experience.) Expect at least $2 more per stem in all colors, as MD is not biased toward any color. *(This year, my shop went from $1ish for a stem of roses to about $2.50-- When we resale this in arrangements, we go from a $3 rose to a $4.50-$5.50 depending on color. This is a general example, as I can not remember last May's numbers well.)*

**Part B:** You probably wont be able to find a local florist, but try branching out to neighboring towns, even if 20-30 miles away, to see if you can find a bigger florist with more floral designers on staff, and asking a trusted member of your wedding party or a guest to pick them up the day of. Order at least 3 months ahead of time, AT LEAST. 

2.) Peonies are picky flowers. They either open too quickly, or stay too tight, and when the florist gets them in a week ahead (to make sure they have time to open, and to check if they are okay) sometimes, they are just awful. They are also very expensive. Often we have to spray these heavily with Crowning Glory☨ if they are too open because they have such a frailty once they are full like you often can see in pics. *(☨a floral liquid that helps the flower remain composed? It's very very light but is like a hairspray for the flower :3 It's awesome really.)* That's just some side info. I don't know any wholesale online, as we work through a local-city based wholesaler, but I suggest talking to your florist about it because it varies for everyone. I'm sorry I don't have any further info on this for you, as Mother's Day alone will make getting any flower more expensive, this will include peonies :( 

ALTERNATIVELY!! You can include high-quality silk flowers in your fresh arrangements. This is a wonderful alternative and, frankly, is hard to tell the difference in both photos and in real life if it is just one or two here and there. If you have Hobby Lobby around, wait until their floral stems come on sale 1/2 off (every 2 or 3 weeks), and pick some up in a light pink or white color in their Fresh Picked line... They look realistic and are way more affordable than the real thing. Usually, if you ask your florist to include your faux flowers in your arrangements, they wont have any issues with that, and if they tell you it looks tacky, they are lying IMO (At least, at my place, we have no issues with that!) I don't remember if Hobby Lobby have it exactly- but this is worth a try to keep the prices down and have that sentiment in your arrangement. It can look slightly different but shouldn't really alter the show of the arrangements :) ([Less expensive](http://shop.hobbylobby.com/products/pink-deluxe-peony-bush-158279/), can look good if tucked away properly, [more expensive](http://shop.hobbylobby.com/products/pink-peony-with-bud-698720/), is more showy and could be featured more prominently if necessary)


Sorry I am so long winded- I just am so passionate for flowers!! I really hope this can help you!! Good luck!!!

The sad part is, I see how life can be great, but I've lacked motivation for quite some time. I've gotten to a point that I've just given up, because sometimes, it's better to have that than try to set up goals and know you can never achieve them. I'm not talking big goals, I'm just talking the little steps, the little goals. Even then, I can't achieve it.

I'm in college now, second semester, and I never had a problem having friends back at home, but I still felt depressed, alone back then. I have a family that loves me, but even then its not enough, and I prevent myself from committing suicide because I don't want to see my parents go through that. 

I joined a frat, thought I had friends, but ever since I went inactive, no one bothers to hang. I try, i seriously do, I do my best to be social(hell, I'm a pretty damn good looking dude and rack in a lot of girls, but I still feel empty) do my best to try to get something going, but even then, this campus feels so cold and shallow(its not your typical college campus, it has a governmental/industrial feel). I wake up everyday, I try to see the good side of things, but even then, I feel depressed and alone. I've felt like this for years now, and I don't know how much longer I can handle.

The meteor that scientists think caused the K-T extinction (killing the dinosaurs) is estimated to have released 100 teratons of energy.

Phil Plait has said that to shatter an Earth size planet would require 2x10^32 Joules of energy, or roughly 57,000,000,000 teratons.

1)It has taken me a full year to get to the point I am, and I am still uncomfortable with a lot of things. This is going from totally monogamous and having first talks, to actually dating other people.

2) Lots and lots longer. Every time there is a new situation it takes time to adjust and can take things you were ok with and make them not ok.

Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1390883138.0,"First off, you can get a copy of Photoshop CS2 for free from Adobe, the only requirement being that you sign up for a free account with them. [You can find more information here](http://gizmodo.com/5973730/grab-photoshop-and-cs2-for-absolutely-free-right-here). Basically, Adobe stopped supporting their authentication servers, which were used as an anti-piracy measure. As such, they were faced with a decision - either tell legitimate owners of CS2 that they could no longer use the software they'd purchased, or make a copy of CS2 that requires no authentication freely available to the masses. Thankfully, they went with the latter. Technically, you are only supposed to take advantage of this if you already own CS2, but it's on the honour system and no one's going to get angry at you.

Photoshop CS2 is great for digital painting. The main features related to digital painting that it lacks over its more recent versions include things like the new brush engine that tries to simulate traditional brushes more accurately, rotating your canvas and automatically backing up your files as you work. I actually don't even use the first two, and as for the last, just.. save often.

Everything else that Photoshop is known for, when it comes to digital painting, is all there. Custom brushes, layers, blending modes, masking, etc... It'll serve you just fine.

On to the Wacom tablets - the thing about wacom tablets, just as with any other tool, is that they won't really make you a better artist. As long as the tablet you're using is not too small, what you have now should take you pretty far. But I'll break down the lines for you anyway.

Right now, for standard tablets (not including the Cintiq line in this), there are two lines. Intuos, and Intuos Pro. Pay attention here, because it gets a little confusing. A long time ago, back when I started, the two lines were called Graphire and Intuos respectively. Then they were renamed as Bamboo and Intuos. Now, for some reason, Wacom has decided to just call everything Intuos. It's pretty ridiculous if you ask me.

Intuos is now the starting line - meant either for light non-art use, or for beginner artists. In this line, you can also get multitouch (so you can use gestures with your fingertips on the tablet). I never found the gestures to be particularly helpful, but that might just be me. In terms of the pressure sensitivity, this line comes with '1024 levels of pressure'. Since you're just getting used to the tablet, this is far more than enough. When it comes to control over the amount of pressure you use, you are probably only able to use a fraction of what the tablet is able to detect. Gradually as you practice more, you may reach a point where the tablet itself will be holding you back. At this point, you may want to consider upgrading to the...

Intuos Pro line! This line of tablets is able to sense 2048 levels of pressure (which as I said before, is meaningless to you now). Another major benefit to it though is the keys and touch wheel on the side. They'll reduce how much you find yourself reaching for the keyboard, assuming you get used to using them. I usually found myself using the touch wheel for things like controlling brush size, but other times I'd reach for the keyboard for hotkeys. Still, it's a very handy feature. I'd probably use it more myself, but I actually invested in a gaming keypad for my hotkeys instead.

In summary, there's only really two models you need to focus on. Intuos (Pen or Pen &amp; Touch, depending on your priorities) and Intuos Pro. Of course, if you have a bamboo right now and you're still getting used to it, I see no reason to go out and buy a new tablet. You're set for a while with what you've got."

The price does fluctuate, however, as the market is completely controlled by the players; some players actually become so rich in-game that they will buy and sell PLEX for real-world profit (this is not an easy point to get to).

Currently there is a huge war going on in Eve, which is, again, completely player-controlled (this is why I *love* Eve, by the way). This means players are constantly dying and being blown up and losing in-game fortunes. We can use the price of in-game PLEX as a sort of medium to gauge the USD-to-Isk pricing:

1 PLEX = $20 = ~600,000,000 Isk

Simplify that and we get a ratio of $1:3\*10^7 Isk (30 mil Isk), or $1 = 30,000,000 Isk. Multiply that by $116,000 and we get: 3.48*10^12 Isk, or:

3,480,000,000,000

So 3.48 trillion Isk-worth of ships and equipment is being destroyed in-game right now. Note that most players end up spending weeks or even months (or even years..?) acquiring these things, and now a lot of them are in a war blowing themselves up (and it's fucking awesome).

I love this game.

danhakimi,technology,1390883308.0,"Social networks allow me to talk to people in different ways.

* Broadcast
* Public conversations: I can speak to person X, and person Y can see it if he's interested.
* Public information: If I want people to know how to spell my last name, or what I majored in, I can just put that up there and whoever wants to know can know, without asking. This is convenient for me and for them.
* Talking to people whose other contact information I don't have. I can find you on facebook with your name. I search for your name, verify with picture/mutual friends, and find you. You don't need to explicitly give me a unique address to find you by, I know how to find you by virtue of who you are and how you introduced yourself.

And the inverse of all of those things. I can consume broadcast, join public conversations, etc. This is all really nice, and totally worth me letting people know about me (especially as I *want* people other than advertisers to know about me)."

Littlereds,glutenfree,1390883472.0,"This can be a very easy and very hard list to make. The reason you don't find easy straight forward lists of gluten free foods is because it's much easier to list the foods you cannot eat: wheat, barley (watch for malt on this one), rye, and oats (because they're generally mixed with wheat and other gluten containing grains). If you're just trying to generally eat grain free, pretty much any meat, any dairy, any fruit and any veggie will be gluten free in it's purest form. Any pasta, beer, or bread is a no-go. 

If you're really trying to cut gluten out of your diet there is no easy list. Not by a long shot. You have to read labels because manufacturers put gluten in almost ANYTHING. Meats often are plumped up with gluten, many things that you assume would be gluten free such as soy sauce, sauces, seasonings and soups are not. And it varies depending on where you live. In some countries manufacturers must list gluten in their ingredients as well as wheat whereas others they need only list wheat but it may contain barley gluten or another form.

msing,PoliticalDiscussion,1390883555.0,"Why blame the 45% of people who know the system is inherently flawed? Sociologists say the American Dream is just a myth, that people vote for inequality redeemed by merit. Political scientists say there's sometimes simply no palpable choice of candidates available for people to elect, because the cost of elections. Historians just say the federal government is just one bulwark unwilling to change except to do less (taxes). 

California has a 55.9% VoterEligiblePerson turnout rate. Smaller states see a 60-65% turnout rate. Makes sense because the current Constitution disenfranchises large states via the Senate. A Californian vote matters less than a Wyoming vote the Senate, and a Californian vote means absolutely nothing for Presidential nominations/elections. There's no reason for a California to vote except for local elections.

marco262,explainlikeimfive,1390883599.0,"I'm going to add another thought to this thread that occurred to me while reading the other responses. It's not an explanation, but rather some musings.

Murder is something that's taught to be unequivocally wrong. From a young age, kids are taught that it's wrong to hurt others, and it's especially bad to kill them.

On the other hand, sex is a murkier subject. It's wrong to have sex in situations X, Y, and Z. Except sex is good and fun and healthy, and you shouldn't be ashamed of it. But don't forget X, Y, and Z.

So it's possible the answer could be that, as far as the state is concerned, the stance on murder is clear enough for a teenager to understand, but the same is not true for sex.

(And before anyone says it, I'm fully aware of the contradictions in the media regarding my points above. Personally, I think murder should be less tolerated by our culture, and sex of all kinds should be more tolerated. But at least I think I've got a decent generalization going.)

Edit: Herp a derp, I've kept reading and others have apparently made this exact point before."

Going by this categorization from [Aerie](http://www.ae.com/aerie/guides/undieguide.jsp?catId=cat5430096), since I get most of my panties from there...

I like Cheeky, Girly Brief, Bikini, and Boybrief.

Note on the bikini, I don't like the ""string bikini"" style ones like in Victoria's Secret....I feel like I'm wearing what sumo wrestlers do in them!  I have a few boyshorts, but don't *really* like them.  They do make my butt look great (I'm proud of my butt, hence why I like Cheekies :D ) but I do *not* like the feeling of the extra fabric touching the top of my thigh.  It rides up a bit for me there too, because while I do have a thigh gap, my thighs are also Mega Thighs.  Even when I wear spandex exercise shorts, those also ride up on the leg opening, and I find that uncomfortable.  Also...can you feel claustrophobia in panties? XD  Earlier in 2013, I kept getting yeast infections cuz my immune system was shot for several months, and I became afraid that all the extra fabric in boyshorts would trigger one in me again.  That's not a logical way to think, but I guess what I'm saying is....I used to like boyshorts but now I am turned off by them.

I have one thong that a friend gave me, and only wear if I have to hide panty lines.  I never got used to how these things feel so I'm not a fan.  "

fatalcharm,AskReddit,1390884002.0,"Actually, I agree after looking through the website a bit more. They are also relying on crowd funding rather than funding from any government. The first mission is estimated to cost $6 billion and every mission after that is estimated to cost $4 billion. While I am sure that there are some eccentric billionaires out there who might be willing to donate or fund the first few missions, it's not exactly going to be very lucrative for them so eventually their funding will stop and the project will have to rely on small donations from the public. I don't think that they are going to get the money that they need to continue on with the project. 

I'm also concerned for the people that they send to Mars, if it actually happens. People will get ill or injured, and there is nothing that can be done if that injury or illness is serious and they need to be taken to a hospital. They will be exposed to higher amounts of radiation than here on earth, their food will be limited and how are they going to get water? They probably will have some sort of water recycling system, but what if it breaks down and they don't have enough resources to repair it?

If they do manage to send the first few crews to Mars and then the funding stops, then you are going to have around 12 people up on Mars, with no more supplies or tools being sent to them. It wouldn't be a nice way to live, or die. It would be incredibly boring too.

The more I learn about it and think about it, the more I realize how crazy and stupid it is to start sending people to Mars, at this point anyway. They will be sending these people to their deaths. A lot can happen in 10 years, but I don't think it will be enough to start sending people to Mars, safely anyway."

the rest is pretty solid.. there's a bit of a self deprecating feel that I think is word choice but that could just be me.   Nothing I would definitively change.

What I'm doing with my life.
Good first sentence.. now expand on it.. What are you teaching?  Why do you love teaching, what age do you teach, are you looking to be a teacher as a life time career and do you want to teach a the subject/age group you're teaching now or is that the job you got and you'll work toward the job you want???

I'm good at.. 
Good conversation starter.. anything else you're good at?

First thing.. usually notice is sight, not sound.. ask a friend or two.

I'd leave the other two in for mention after.. Personally I like loud laughter and someone who's talking to the produce, or at least appearing to.

Favorites.. nicely organized.. and I recommend Winter's Tale by Mark Helprin.. an especially good read during winter, living near the lake.

Expand on foods a little.. that's a go to spot when trying to figure out what restaurant to take a date to so give them something to work with.. cuisines you like, dishes you adore, offering to take you out to breakfast can sound like an expectation you're staying the night, but breakfast for dinner could work.

Six things.. solid.

Thinking about.. Excellent.

don't forget to attribute Yeats.. not everyone will recognize it or google it.

Typical Friday.. Listening to Local Music?  Making Local Music?  Avoiding Local Music?  Otherwise pretty solid

Private thing.. 

titillating without being salacious.. good.

Every beta tester made an agreement with ZOS that in exchange for playing the game before other people, they wouldn't share details to people who weren't also in that group. Breaking that agreement is a wonderful way to not be offered it again, and I highly doubt that I'm the only one around who isn't a spoiled, self-centered jerk who thinks they're owed access and have the absolute right to yell from the rooftops when people give them the *privilege* that they think is their *natural right*. Because it isn't. ZOS didn't have to give us a damn thing before release and to blatantly break faith with them because you want to feel special is an insult to ZOS and the rest of the community with whom you are associated because other people will get the detrimental effects of your actions.

Probably not. To borrow a simile from Louis CK, it would be like going into a cancer ward and saying, ""Not me! I don't have it!""

Honestly, it hurts your insides to think that the person you love more than anything wouldn't stop themselves before it was too late. He's going to have some problems trusting you, and every time you drink when you're not together he is going to worry. He may also be mad that he puts a lot of energy into avoiding situations like that (ie- getting blackout drunk with members of the opposite sex) and that you disregarded that, and did not do the same. 

I'm not trying to make it worse but I really think you need to understand that however you feel, he probably feels worse. I'm glad he wants to work it out, but he's basically agreeing to worry about you tenfold for the rest of your relationship. 

If you're scared about what happened, and you're scared you will make the same mistake again, then there is one solution. Drink Less.

derleth,badhistory,1390884359.0,"&gt; The difference is more profound. Marxism, after all, began (in part) as a critique and rejection of liberalism. They are different schools of thought, not waypoints along a single political continuum.

OK, interesting. While doing some of my own research, I came upon [this interview between H.G. Wells and Stalin.](http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1934/07/23.htm) It's titled ""Marxism Versus Liberalism"" and it seems to imply that 'liberalism' is defined as reforming capitalism while not instituting a planned economy. Which seems pretty much like what the saner of the Fox News pundits would call liberalism: Social welfare, safety net policies, and not being opposed to all forms of taxation, but stopping well short of confiscation and complete nationalization.

Wikipedia defines liberalism in much the same way, focusing more on 'capitalism with a respect for human rights' in the form of explicit minority rights laws and deciding policy by voting in a representative democracy.

Also, all of those things are also socialism in terms of Social Democracy, which is what I meant by Gradualism. Divorcing them entirely seems unnatural, therefore, unless you think Socialism can only be the discredited Dictatorship of the Proletariat which not even Marx bothered to define very well.

My ultimate point, and even Wells seems to agree, is that liberalism can apparently include socialist characteristics, as the New Deal did. Therefore I'm confused by your (professor's?) position that liberalism and socialism are at odds.

&gt; I guess that depends on whether you believe ""being Socialist"" is rooted in orthodoxy or orthopraxy.

I already know what I think. All I'm interested in is what you think."

After MUCH consideration, only recently have I come to realise that I am an INTJ after believing for years that I was an INFJ. Although I'm absolutely sure now than I am an INTJ, I still can't tell whether or not I was an INFJ in the past. My upbringing is responsible for this.

I was born and raised in the UK by somewhat traditional South Asian parents. When I say traditional, I mean in the sense that our culture is a collectivist culture and they are both the eldest child/sibling in their families so they are the most responsible ones who are made to deal with/solve their younger siblings' issues. (Between them, they have about 30 siblings, and most of them are in their 30s and 40s with their own families.) Because their lives have always revolved around their huge families so much, my life also revolved around their lives so I was brought up in a way that I believed enhanced my Fe which is why I confused myself for an INFJ for so long. I wouldn't say that I'm family orientated but my collectivist culture and upbringing has taught me to cater to such a large number of people in way where it's almost second nature to me. During big family events I assume people-orientated responsibilities I would usually avoid entirely and during these situations I get told I'd make ""the perfect housewife"" because I do what I do well. I mean, consider typical INTJ stereotypes -- would housewife/husband ever fit into that?! :O

Anyway, because of this and more (which I won't go into because this reply is already longer than initially planned :o) I always assumed Fe was me. It wasn't until a few months ago, when I came across some Psychopathy test which showed that I am likely to be a psychopath that I seriously started wondering if I've turned into an INTJ. I suspected it but I was never sure. I took the tests and refused to use family/culture as examples to further explain questions in the test to myself, and in the end they all said INTJ. I looked into the cognitive functions for further info and the slow process of realisation started.

So, getting to my point, OP, look into the cognitive functions instead of the types. Ni, Te and Fi are what you specifically should be looking at for INTJ. They'll tell more than anything else could. If you find the descriptions fit you perfectly but some aspects of your mind/personality don't fit it then look into the various explanations such as culture or upbringing. If you find these descriptions don't fit then look into the opposite function(s), i.e. Ne, Ti, Fe."

nerdrowwilson1,DCcomics,1390884389.0,"Casual fans (aka people who only watch the movie most of the time) will say Batman because he is the most public character. People grew up with him, and still like him, even if they don't pursue comics as an interest.

After reading a few classic Batman books, as well as more modern ones, I will say he is pretty cool, but the fact that they write him so powerful is ridiculous. I have no problem with him doing his Gotham crime fighting with non-supers. But when he is fighting in the JL against something like Darkseid, it is kinda ridiculous. Even Croc or Grundy are tough fights for him. Green Lantern on the other hand, while not inherently super powered, has his ring to actually give him a fighting chance.

I like both, but do see some flaws with Batman's writing sometimes, specifically with team ups against monstrous fours.

Edit: if you disagree with me, respond. Don't just downvote me for saying that Batman didn't make me jizz in my pants."

I remember back in the '90s Mary Chapin Carpenter had a hit 'Down at the Twist and Shout,' from Shooting Straight in the Dark. For the longest time I assumed the rest of the album was also zydeco/dance-oriented, but in reality the rest of the album was a very down to earth acoustic/folk record. I realized then that the single was basically a stylistic outlier designed to get me to purchase the album (in somewhat of a pseudo bait-and-switch tactic). I'm weary of so-called singles now. Lots of times they just don't represent the artist's true style. Thankfully it's easier than ever nowadays to give an album a listen before buying, but before iTunes/etc. singles played much larger roles in getting me to buy a record."

You may have pains, discomforts or bodily issues that your brain has decided needed to be dealt with. Changes in light, sound and temperature can also cause you to wake.

Needless to say, there's a lot that needs to be accounted for to find out why you woke up.

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390884729.0,"There are a few reasons. 

1. I think people need a variety of relationships in order to be balanced.  It's good to have relatives to turn to, but having friends is not just about filling a need for companionship or support. It's about learning and growing as a person and helping others do the same. Different relationships require different things and bring out different things in a person.  Every relationship teaches you new things, and relationships of different types teach you different types of things. If a guy doesn't have friends, it tells me that there are a lot of lessons about himself and about other people that he hasn't had the chance to learn. 

Just like you don't just need teachers, you also need parents. You don't just need teammates, you need coaches. To use another analogy: if life is like school, then different types of relationships are like different subjects you take. It's important not only to learn to read, but to also learn to do math, science, etc. 

Yes, your brothers and cousins can be there to support you. But it just isn't the same for many reasons. Firstly, families have hierarchies. The way you relate to an older brother is different from the way you relate to a younger brother; in the same way, the way you relate to a brother is different from the way you relate to a friend. 

Secondly, family ties are relationships by default. With family, there is a built-in loyalty. Something has to go wrong for them to stop supporting you. The assumption is that they will. Sure, you can put in more effort to get closer with your family  than the average bloke, but it's still fundamentally different from making friends. Friends are people you have to find yourself, and the relationship is something you build yourself. That's takes different social skills, it takes a different awareness of yourself, and it takes a different awareness of how relationships work. And once you've built a friendship, it takes a lot to keep it strong. These are life lessons that I feel like a guy with no friends would not know. 

2. Being romantic partners is built around friendship. It's sort of like advanced friendship. It seems unlikely to me that someone who doesn't have other friends would be very good at being a friend for me. 

3. I would feel like we have radically different priorities and an incompatible outlook on how to relate to people. Since friends are important to me, if you didn't understand that, then you would not understand a very important part of my life.  I'm introverted and I prefer having a few close friends to having many, but I still care deeply about those friendships and I feel that I learn from them. Conversely, I would not be able to relate to your desire not to have friends, nor your focus on other goals.

And there I am like, ""Chill, it was a jo...oh wait...no no, maybe you're right.  I'm a horrible person""  

So fast forward to college.  Her mom turns out to be one of my teachers.  So we're at a party at her house and its painfully obvious that because of this one incident I've totally ruined my chances with her.  Her mom on the other hand becomes like my best friend that day.  Then a few weeks later her mom invites me out to dinner.

So I show up to dinner and she starts talking about her ex husband etc and how she just recently quit her teaching job.  Thats when my mind clicked that we were the only 2 people who showed up to this supposed dinner thing.  Basically I was kind of creeped out after that and never spoke to any of them again. "

I am 5'2"" and used to weigh 100 lbs.  I ate very infrequently, because I was terrified of gaining weight.  After years of being somewhat anorexic, I eventually developed a binge eating problem.  I'm not talking just eating a few too many chips--I'm talking stuffing myself with everything in sight until I physically couldn't handle it anymore and it would come up again.  I once ate 4 lbs of raisins in one sitting, and it was the most horrible thing I've ever done to myself.  And yet, it was this irrational compulsion that overcame me again and again.

I never thought that I'd break 120 lbs, but I did last year.  I was binge eating enough that not even my obsessive exercising could stop me from gaining weight.  Since then, it's been a true struggle for me to just eat like a normal person.  I can't tell you how badly I want to.  I can't tell you how much I wish I could go back to the days when I just ate when I felt hungry and stopped when I wasn't.  I'm back to a normal weight now, but I'm chunky in a way that I've never been before.

The Anti-Abortion Bill that Davis famously filibustered against was supported by 40% of Hispanics. Not a majority, and less than the 43% that opposed the bill, but 40% is in line with the base for the question and only 5% below Whites polled. For a demographic that is supposed to lean Dem, this is dead even. You'll also note in the PDF that the margin of error is 4.4%, granted that can go either way. African-American's, for comparison, opposed the Anti-Abortion bill by a huge margin of 34%: a much more logical margin for a demographic considered safely Democratic. Hispanics only supported it by a margin of 3%. That's pretty damn far from being a safe demographic for Democrats who plan to leverage that issue more than any. If Wendy Davis gets more than 60% of the Hispanic vote in this race, I'll donate a month's salary to Clinton 2016.

And by the way, your cited ""poll"" (exit polls are not polls) did not mention social issues, or I missed it. But I checked pretty well. The question about which issue is more important does not list abortion issues as an answer option. 
Also, you should never cite a poll that doesn't list its methodology, sample size, and margin of error. Yours is missing all of that information.

loyyd,AskWomen,1390884988.0,"That definitely happens but I think the type who decry the wrongness of having been friend zoned don't necessarily fall into this category. It's completely dependent on the guy in question as to whether the friendship was established with purely platonic intentions from the start but I would say that more often than not, physical attraction is the motivator. 

There's nothing wrong with being physically attracted to someone and trying to express it, but they do it in such a horribly convoluted and wrong way and worst of all, they don't understand why it doesn't work. To them, the onus of failure lies with the girl, because they're being a nice guy, which they've been told from the get-go that women like that and are attracted to that (wrongly), so when they follow the advice to the letter and it fails, where else can the blame lie? As far as a guy in this situation and from this perspective can understand, he did everything right, so it was the girl who wronged him by considering him as nothing more than a friend.

Now, that entire chain of logic is so horribly wrong and filled with holes that it's ridiculous but they don't have anything to tell them otherwise so they don't realize until it the pressure of being unsuccessful forces them to seek out how to be successful with women. 

I think the type of guy who has a missed opportunity situation is much the same as the girl who crushes on a guy but never makes a move or makes it known. I don't think the guy in this situation feels friend-zoned as he understands what went wrong but he might sometimes avoid the truth and say he was friendzoned or be told he was by others."

It's a very fine line and even toeing it will more than likely end in a lawsuit. Whether you win or lose is a different story.

enna_,weddingplanning,1390885017.0,"At my shop, we honestly find it a little weird that people would want to. Orchids look alright submerged, and so does Baby's Breath, but honestly I think it is strange. Somethings to note about submerged centerpieces is that they are extremely heavy and hard to transport if already filled. It's difficult to do the flowers on site as a florist though. If kept cool, they can last many days (which means you could do them ahead of time, but then there is the transporting issue.) Flowers/plants begin to get mushy if kept in warm water for very long (more than a day or two,) so keep that in mind when deciding! It's not a bad idea, and I think that latex calla lilies would look nice if they are high quality and the stems are done right... Honestly, no one is examining your centerpieces while y'all eat though! So don't worry too much about that :) I'm a traditional girl, but if this is something you like the idea of, why not? Try it out, put it on your dinner table, see how it looks for a dinner. If you like it without all the fancy parts of a wedding, you'll like it at your wedding even better (probably!) :)

Flowers do cost a lot! Especially when working through a florist! But I am here to say, it's worth it to go through one. It saves you the stress of having to worry, ""What will I do?! Who will help me!? Ahhh!"" :) Cheap beautiful arrangements are carnations, baby's breath, poms, golden rod, filler flowers look amazing when there is a bunch of them, and of course seasonals. Everyone hates carnations for some reason but they can be THE BOMB!!! Here are some gorgeous ideas I've always loved that include carnations. (I'll put price with the pics so you have a general idea)

http://i.imgur.com/ndAjWWF.jpg 
These are the coolest! You can rest them on a dollar store clear vase and fill the vase with stones or something, or mount them on things like candle stick holders! They aren't completely ""cheap"" but they are definitely less expensive than a lot of things florists will do! (Depending on size/florist/location=$15-35)

http://i.imgur.com/pv9WzHW.jpg
Once again, carnations come in all sorts of colors and can often be found at $1.00 or a little less per stem! ($15-$25, including vase &amp; labor-- Raw price=$15ish--$12ish(flowers)+$3.50(vase))

http://i.imgur.com/aJYSq0B.jpg
I HATE TWINE AND MASON JARS AND BURLAP but that doesn't mean you will! Inexpensive vase (could be anything!!) and no floral foam = cheap! This has some spray roses ($3.50 stem florist price), stock ($3 stem), carns ($1), and BB (between $1-3 per vase for a crap ton of it)... That's between $15(bare minimum on roses&amp;stock), and $25(with more roses and stock.) Stock is awesome :)

http://i.imgur.com/30VCCu9.jpg
That one in the top right is probably a great idea... The others are a little bit pricier (PROBABLY!) The top right has wax flower like crazy, which is a beautiful white/orange/pink/purple filler flower. In a little pot like that?! Ooft too cute! Maybe $5 pot, $10 on flowers... then labor on top of that :)

http://i.imgur.com/e0wSJAf.jpg This is the last one I will recommend- 2 or 3 gerber daisies in a tall vase with water and stones. Gerbs=roughly the same amount as a rose. Very delicate. $3.50 per stem, vase=$5, and stones $2 per bag at Hobby Lobby :) ($15-20)

Even less expensive: Single stems in bud vases from the thrift store. Put a cluster of vases w/ different but matching flowers in the middle with varying heights. Include filler flowers (BB, Misty Blue, Wax flower, bear grass for dramatic look) Sprinkle rose petals at bottom. Bam! $10 centerpieces. Can't say it's the most proper, but I've seen it done online. I like it :)


Flowers at the high end supermarkets (Like safeway, publix, costco, etc often are less expensive than florist.) Try your local Kroger brand store's flowers if you are doing it on your own. Their quality is often good.

See if your florist can lend you vases (rentals!) Sometimes they have some on hand from previous weddings that left their vases behind.

See if you can bring your florist ""recycled"" vases (bringing in your own, whether new or old, can take $3-$5 off of each arrangement!) 

Disclaimer= I am not a pricing pro- I just know how it goes in my neck of the woods! If you need more ideas, or want me to price your idea out, or need help doing a DIY- let me know :D

Availability will always depend on location. Order early, ask your florist if it is possible!

All right! Thanks for the input. I am actually a very extroverted, confident and social person, so if you're getting those signals from my profile, it means something is seriously off!

&gt; You start your self summary with a pretty decent first sentence and then rest of the paragraph is crap.

Got it, we definitely have consensus on the ""nice guy"" stuff being BS. I will drop it.

&gt; Drop the second paragraph in your ""what I'm doing with my life.

I'm already over it

&gt; Drop all the sentences in the third paragraph after you talk about fencing is how you stay in shape. Basically keep the first sentence and drop the rest. No one needs to know you were heavier in the past. You are who you are now.

I can dig it.

&gt; Drop the entire first things people notice about me and rewrite it with something less than a paragraph in length and actually telling about you.

Yeah, seems like this was just too long. Ah well.

&gt; Your six things is very generic and should be rewritten.

Any ideas/examples/tips? I was reading the wiki while coming up with this stuff.

&gt; Your Friday night tells us very little about you.

Hmmm. All right. I'll have to think of something better for this; maybe for now I'll just leave it blank.

&gt; Drop your private thing. You're going to scare women off (if you already haven't turned them off with some of your other content.)

Got it.

&gt; Your you should message me is all over the place. The first, third and sixth item listed are good, keep those. You can use the questions to indicate your BDSM interests. I don't know where the polyamory belongs. Most people put it in the self summary as it's a very significant detail about how they date/engage in relationships.

That's fair, maybe I'll move the poly thing to the self-summary.

&gt; The best part of your profile is your favorites. You've got some great lines in there-particularly about the pears.

Thanks!

&gt; Drop your main pic-it looks like you have a mullet.

I like how my face looks so I'll keep it, but I'll change my main pic to the hardhat one as you suggested.

twelvedayslate,AskReddit,1390885389.0,"Oh, absolutely. I'm not complaining about not being ""wealthy!"" I had a great childhood.

To answer the OP's questions: 

No, I was really unaware of my parents' money. All through elementary school, I somehow had the notion that my family made 32k, and that seemed like a lot to me. I didn't realize how much my parents made until I was in college.

My parents were pretty frugal. Yes, they bought new cars, but not every year or something and nothing too fancy- Hondas, Fords, etc. Not BMWs, lol. We had vacations, which seemed great as a kid, but they weren't extravagant, and some of our vacations were just going camping for a few days. We didn't leave the country and lots of our vacations were just visiting family. Birthdays and Christmas weren't too extravagant either: yes, there were presents, but there wasn't anything huge. We didn't get new cars for our 16th birthdays. One year, my big present was a razor scooter for my birthday, if that tells you anything (though I had other smaller presents).

I think the above is due to two things: one, my parents grew up on the poorer end, so I think they really wanted to instill in us the notion of being down to earth, not guided by money, etc. And two, my parents are all about saving. They paid for my education which, in the end, means 234380438x more than me than an extravagant vacation or a whole living room full of Christmas presents.  "

danhakimi,technology,1390885536.0,"Why people like communicating in those ways?

People mostly aren't as private as you. People often don't mind if one random friend of theirs wants to join the conversation -- at least for some conversations. People sometimes do like the idea of speaking to a large number of people at once. People want to be reachable. People want other people to know things about them without always having to ask every little thing.

And being able to contact people in general... Because that's a key feature... Emails and phone numbers are cumbersome, and I don't always exchange them with every person I ever want to speak with again. Sometimes, people have something to say to me that they didn't anticipate they'd have to say to me. Or they didn't remember to get my number or my email or my gchat or my aim or my skype or my god knows the fuck what. Well guess what? There's one place they can go where all they need to do is type in my name, hit the button that says we toootttally know each other, and bam, we're in touch. I know you hate people, and don't want to be in touch with them unless you've sat down and negotiated it for hours on end, but you have to realize... this is a feature *almost every real person* wants.

I've been on a plane multiple times, but like I said, in hindsight, they really were mainly visiting family type vacations. I'm actually struggling to remember a *real* vacation we went on as a kid that wasn't to visit family (we have lots of family out of state!), or part of one of my dad's work trips where he'd just take the family for a few days or something. We'd go throughout the state and camping and whatever as a family, but not serious vacations, no. As a kid (a teen by then, actually), I remember leaving the country once, and my grandparents paid for my siblings' and my plane tickets and we got free lodging, sooo... (they were living out of the country for a year and we went to visit them). 

*Edit: I remember hearing all the time as a kid ""no, we can't afford that"" when I was being a brat and asking for like, all the Barbies or something.

If a guy follows advice given to him about how to interact with women yet it continuously fails (but it's never revealed why), isn't it the women's fault from his point of view?

I'm going to assume that you, for whatever reason, can't take his advice and take your post at face value. You have one player who is dominating combat and the other players feel useless.

I'd recommend making combats a little more complex. It will mean a little more work for you, but prepared properly, you shouldn't have to do a whole lot more work during the game than you usually do. Try to make your encounters have a few multiple aspects.

Rather than just have a bunch of monsters to hit and kill, give your encounters some environmental hazards. Maybe provide clues or an environment that a smart player can take advantage of. Ideally, I'm imagining a scenario where your Warblade isn't stealing the show, but rather just providing support to some of the other players by holding off a huge monster while they're frantically trying to open a door or decipher some runes.

How you do this is up to you, and definitely dependent on your players and your scene, but you should be able to get at least one multi-faceted encounter into your campaign and give everyone something to do."

MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE,badhistory,1390885757.0,"I would caution you that Wells is an odd bird and his politics are hard to pin down, although my dissertation adviser makes a big deal about Wells and his particular contribution to liberal international relations thought (but my dissertation adviser is an odd bird himself).

You'll also have to remember that ""liberalism"" in 1930s Britain means something much closer to ""classical liberalism"" than what we think of as liberalism in the present day U.S.

I would also challenge your implied assumption that the welfare state is necessarily socialist.  Gøsta Esping-Andersen wrote an insightful book, *The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism*, which detailed and explained conservative, liberal, and socialist approaches to state welfare provision.  Again, despite what you might hear on Fox News, the U.S. welfare state is not (as configured) evidence of creeping socialism.

&gt; Wikipedia defines liberalism in much the same way, focusing more on 'capitalism with a respect for human rights' in the form of explicit minority rights laws and deciding policy by voting in a representative democracy.

This is why academics tell their students not to cite Wikipedia when doing research papers.  Liberalism *invented* the approach to political economy that Marxists labeled ""capitalism.""  Capitalism==liberalism.  But Wikipedia presents liberalism as a reformist approach to capitalism, which is absurd.  Capitalism, natural law rights, and republicanism/democracy are all aspects of liberalism's broader project of placing limits on the arbitrary power of the sovereign.  Moreover, Adam Smith himself was a moral philosopher, and his book before *The Wealth of Nations* was *The Theory of Moral Sentiments*, which informed his work on liberal political economy.

I think both liberalism and socialism have areas of overlap, but they arrive at those shared areas of concern from different ontological/normative starting points and with a different normative outcomes in mind.

As far as being a socialist in a democracy, go ahead and vote.  Socialism claims democracy as one of its values.  Should you waste a vote on the American Communist Party?  Probably not.  Does that make you a bad socialist?  Probably not (unless you're a reject-the-second-international-Leninist-type or a Maoist orthopraxy type).  In Europe, when taking a country over, socialists stressed [united front coalitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_front) and [salami tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami_tactics), which was an acceptance of strategic voting and political compromise."

bombeater,OkCupid,1390885806.0,"&gt; I advise cutting the one with the empty pizza boxes on the coffee table and the unfunny joke about freeweights.

It's outta there!

&gt; I noticed such a strong trend towards kink that I broke my normal order and went searching for an explaination in your About Me. I had to read literally everything before I found it in ""Message Me If.""
Please don't misunderstand, I don't have ANY problems with polyamory or BDSM. However, I wonder if it's possible that you might be turning some women off that might otherwise be interested in you. Unless you absolutely can not date or be friends with someone who isn't already a part of that scene, it might be a good idea to dial back a little.

You know, I never really thought about how my choice of questions would come off.

I can't really date someone who isn't kinky/polyamorous because they're pretty significant parts of my romantic and sexual life, but I'm friends with all sorts of people. I guess I can trim some of the questions, though.

&gt; Also, in the question about being an alcoholic, you say you don't drink, but in ""My Details,"" it says you drink socially. Which is it?

I can't find the question you're referring to... what's the text of it?

&gt; I believe you when you say you're not a Nice GuyTM but it might be best not to mention that at all.

Agreed, I've cut that out

&gt; You should cut the second paragraph of ""What I'm doing With My Life."" Sorry, but programming is inherently boring so I would go straight into the fencing/staying in shape.

I disagree. Programming is awesome. I think that this is one of those subjects which indicates ""turn-off for people who aren't a great match for me"" as opposed to ""turn-off for most people"". It's fine that you think programming is inherently boring, but it's probably just a sign that we shouldn't go on a date. ;-)

&gt; I like the story about the canvasser in Penn Station, but it's way too long. You're asking for a huge commitment if you want people to read the whole thing.

I'm glad you like it! You're right about it being way too long, though. I've decided to just drop it and try something else.

&gt; ""I Spend a lot of Time Thinking About"" doesn't really do it for me. 90+% of the time I read about programming my brain just switches off.

I'll meet you half-way; since I already talk about programming in another essay, I'm sure I can find something different to talk about in this one.

&gt; From my perspective, a lifetime of underachievement and a recent psychological diagnosis might be little much to share with someone you haven't even shared a coffee with, but YMMV.

The general consensus seems to be that ADD is an overshare, which I can understand. I've decided to change that one too.

&gt; Get rid of 'casual sex' under ""Looking For."" I promise, a woman who likes you and wants casual sex isn't going to ignore your profile because it isn't there, but a woman who is looking for anything else probably will.

Well-stated.

&gt; I don't like to designate profiles as ""good"" or ""bad,"" I prefer to describe how effective they are. I think your current version will only be effective act getting messages or replies from a very narrow group of people, but if you make a few easy edits, and make it a little more reserved, it can be effective for a much larger audience.

Thanks so much! You gave really great advice, much of which I am implementing now."

It wouldn't matter how great she was or how great you two were together if you spent the relationship regretting what else you could have had. That wouldn't be fair to either of you.

But if, after you play the field a bit, you still find yourself avoiding better chemistry, then reevaluate what's going on.  That would be a different situation than where you are now. I don't know what sort of a time frame makes sense, or hook up number, I think that's all pretty subjective.

If you do want a family at some point, and settling down, keep that in mind so you don't stuck in a playboy lifestyle you find ultimately unfulfilling.

However it always best to be honest, with yourself and partners, about the level of commitment you want and can deliver on. All the love and compatibility in the world don't build commitment. It has to be something you also want for it's own sake.

It can't be the part about Arena being random and basically a strugglefest if you haven't learned the game fairly well, because that is entirely true. Someone just finishing the tutorial, without seeing most of the cards, is going to lose most of their games in the arena.

It can't be the part where he said it was pay to win, because (for people coming into the open beta now) it is severely limiting to try and be competitive in ranked play without a wide card base that you can only achieve from time (To do well in the arena, you need to study the game well enough to have a good record, and then you need to play all the arena games to get all those cards.) If you are a monster at Arena, that is still several days played to get enough (See: all) the cards to be competitive at ranked play. Or even the cards to do fun side projects of silly decks to play with your friends.

When I went to Australia I went down there with a company in mind (my friend from there was already set up there, but they had offices in Vancouver where I was living as well) and he kind of got my foot in the door.  Going to London on the other hand, I just got in touch with one of the office managers for a location in London through our company directory...  I didn't apply for anything specific, but just told them that I was planning to come to London, already worked for the company in North America and was interested in continuing my career while I was over there.  I had an interview set up for a few days after arriving and negotiated to start a month after that so I could attend a friends wedding on the continent.

The temp agency I found very easy. I sent them my resume after already having worked in Sydney for six months and had some idea of what the agencies were looking for, so tailored my resume a bit for that.  I got a call back within 20 minutes of submitting, and the placement girl on the other end said ""You are so fucking employable it's ridiculous."" I think I was lucky in my timing with that, but it helped that I had a lot of experience in the field.

I think so long as you have any kind of office skills, temp agencies are going to be able to find you something, even if it's something like data entry.  However, because it seems other countries use these agencies a bit more than in North America, there are some pretty specific industry agencies that you can look into as well.  So, if you are in a career or have one in mind, you can always try to find an agency that deals specifically in your field and probably have a better chance.

Any other questions just shoot!"

Anyway, it is for these reasons that I'm reluctant to have a very ""ra ra kinky/poly"" profile, because if I read a profile like that before I was into those things, it would have been a turn off for me even though I eventually got into them in a big way.

So I guess I'm just trying to find the right balance. In another comment someone mentioned that the poly thing at least is better stated up-front in the self-summary, which I think I agree with.

RichardBehiel,spacex,1390886233.0,"You know, even though I'm a total Elon Musk fanboy, I'm not so sure that's a good thing.  Having background knowledge in programming/engineering is always a good trait for a leader to have, but I think that there might be some more important ones.  

Hear me out: Programmers and engineers are no doubt the most important people when it comes to actually getting shit done.  They have practical knowledge and apply it directly to solve all kinds of problems, come up with remarkable new ideas, and ultimately change the world.  

That said, a good *leader* will always be someone with passion and charisma, who can galvanize similar feelings in those they lead and inspire them to see things the way they do.  A general knowledge of their field is required, sure, but what really matters is their ability to summarize complex ideas and eloquently deliver them to the masses.

For instance if you're trying to rally public support for SpaceX, it doesn't matter how much you know about the benefits of using methane instead of kerosene, because most people just don't care.  It doesn't matter if orbital mechanics is second nature to you, because most people just don't care.  Know a lot about ablative heat shields?  Most people *just don't care*.  If you want to inspire an audience, skip the technical details and talk about going to Mars!  

Musk is unusual, to say the least.  He's clearly passionate about his work, spending 100+ hours a week in pursuit of making the world a better place (at his own financial risk), but he doesn't communicate that passion to others in the same kind of way that someone like Steve Jobs would.  Instead of giving exciting speeches about how his company will change the world, it seems like he just goes ahead and does it.  He's a lightning rod for programmers and engineers who share his goals and want to help make them a reality, but to the average person he probably comes across as just some successful yet somewhat boring engineer/businessman.  

Then again, it doesn't really matter (yet) what the average person thinks of Elon Musk.  You don't *need* a great public image in order to launch rockets, and the Model S pretty much sells itself at this point (have you ever seen a Tesla commercial?).  However, if Tesla does manage to scale up and build a Model E for the masses, some good PR would probably go a long way towards sales.  With that in mind, I think that a charismatic CEO would be better able to convince people that electric cars are cool than would a ""boring"" CEO who knows all the technical details."

Like a lot of games, things seem overwhelming until you begin to recognize the patterns at which point, it becomes routine.

Colonial nations can be frustrating, but overall, I've decided that I like the change. They behave like protectorates without tying up any diplomatic relations, and that's pretty awesome. They also take care of all their own coring and conversion needs, so you can conserve those types of resources for your home provinces.

I do wish you had the ability to keep at least ONE province under your direct control, though, given that colonial nations can't be given ""missions"" or otherwise controlled by the mother nation. For example, if I want a colonial province to have good naval repair capabilities and serve as a naval base, there's no way to direct a colonial nation to follow that course. Similarly, not being able to recruit any soldiers overseas is really annoying from an administrative/micromanaging perspective. I never use the ""consolidate forces"" button when in my colonies anymore because I don't want my regiments to evaporate away."

LucasSatie,NoStupidQuestions,1390886436.0,"My biggest problem comes from the use of obese. It's based on BMI and those numbers are extremely unscientific. For instance, a person who is 5'6"" tall only has to weight 186 pounds to be ""obese"". However, this doesn't account for body fat or muscle.

Basing this on ""obesity"" is kind of... bad.

I mean, [looking at this study](http://www.gallup.com/poll/150947/self-reported-weight-nearly-pounds-1990.aspx) it would seem that the average American is only overweight by 15 pounds for men and 22 pounds for women. 

Although, the ending remark on the article rings true in many ways ""while Americans are getting heavier, many may not recognize it"".

Edit: [and on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight) it would appear that Americans are only ~10-15 pounds heavier than many of their first-world counterparts."

1) If you have friends in a server (usually/sometimes) it will appear in the friends column of the server browser. It doesn't always work though. 

2) You can use your friends list in steam to connect to the same server as your friends.

The way this works is, for example, you are in a server and it resets. Everyone but one of your friends leaves this now reset server. Because your friend is still connected to the server, even if its reset (and they can't do anything) YOU can still connect to that server through them (Through steam is the easiest.)

That way you can connect to the server you just left and once other people have, your friend can leave and join through you."

Hinaiichigo,teenagers,1390886553.0,"My parents smoke. Cigarettes, I mean. My grandfather died of lung cancer. My grandmother has breast cancer. They smell like smoke, our house smells like smoke, even though they smoke outside. Their breath smells like smoke. All they think about is smoking. The smoke, which is constantly accumulated in the garage, makes it incredibly hard for me to breath and gives me migraines. Cigarettes are deadly, if not to the secondhand consumer then simply to the consumer himself. I don't see why you would consciously do something that honestly does nothing but harm to yourself. I understand it is an addiction, but when your parents really don't want to quit and show no signs of even attempting to, it's kind of unsettling. They wouldn't quit for anyone. Not even for me, their daughter. 

Marijuana I'm more lenient on, but I still don't like it. Smoking anything will have you inhaling more carcinogens than you can count. I don't see the appeal of getting high. Ok, it feels good. But you can do a lot more fun and social things that make you feel good. I'm super athletic, so there's no way I could get away with that shit. I'd rather go for a run anyway.

mmp31,politics,1390886609.0,"&gt;Didn't you just finished making the point that higher profitability leads to more jobs?

No, I never made that point. Straw man.

&gt;That's a half-baked, supply-side talking point. Wages are based upon a variety of economic factors, cost of living being one of the most prominent, not prices alone. Supply and demand also plays a prominent role in compensation levels, but we're looking at a dysmorphic labor market at the moment.

I never claimed that wages were based on prices alone.  That's straw man #2.  I said what constitutes a ""decent"" wage is dependent on what prices are doing.

&gt;Sorry to disappoint you on this point, but you're mostly wrong. Here's why: Federal Reserve monetary policy INFLUENCES the direction of the market, it does not control it by expanding and shrinking the money supply. We're talking about the difference between textbook theories and reality here. If the Fed controlled inflation and the market, as you assume, Bernanke wouldn't have shot the Fed wad and found himself with precious little Main Street economic recovery to show for it.

You're defining ""money supply"" differently that I was.  I was referring to MB.

&gt; I don't dispute that both Greenspan and Bernanke are responsible for letting things get out of hand with the money supply. Bernanke should have NEVER embarked on quantitative easing without MAJOR strings attached (i.e., significant banking legislation reforms and reinstatement of Glass-Steagall).

Why do you think that reinstating Glass Steagall would have helped?

&gt;All told, market forces drive inflation, particularly those found in the business community.

The market cannot create inflation without an initial expansion of MB by the Fed."

Language is a fluid thing. It changes over time. New words are made, and new pronunciations and done. You may have noticed that people from different places pronounce things in different ways. For example: in Great Britain aluminum is pronounce al-loo-min-ee-um whereas in the USA it is more commonly pronounced al-loo-min-um.  This is the same deal except for the word espresso only has one type of spelling (there hasn't become a second type of spelling of espresso unlike aluminum/aluminium). 

The thing about language is that these phonetics don't change the semantics. You know what someone means when they say ess-press-oh or ex-press-oh. So while you may internally cringe at the sound of it, it still conveyed the meaning. At some time in the future the English standard may change for the US to change the official spelling of the word, or it may not. Just because a group of people collectively uses a different pronunciation than another does not make them ""idiots"" it makes them human.

annapie,bigdickproblems,1390886845.0,"Ultimately, it's not something you can change. On one side, that makes it harder to deal with, I know. But at a certain point you're going to have to accept it. Jelqing sounds dumb to me, and if you're gaining length at the expense of girth (jelqing isn't going to add more mass), that's doubly dumb.

If it truly is an anxiety problem for you, go see a professional if you can afford it. If you can't afford it, I'm sure there are some online resources that can help you. You just have to come at it from the angle of treating the anxiety.

I hope you can intellectually understand what other people in the threads you post are saying to you. I think you might, but then the back of your mind starts going ""what if, what if, what if."" That's something that's really hard to think your way out of on your own, which is why I recommend talking to someone about it.

EDIT: *Also, once you can get past this roadbump and start having more sexual relationships, I think that will help you a lot too. I just don't see that you're necessarily ready to put yourself out there yet. It's scary regardless of anxiety.*"

I can't say anything about the interpretation program because I'm not in it, but I have a few friends that say they really like it. We also have No Voice Zone, which is every Wednesday, where hearing and HOH kids both go to learn sign with each other.

Your main fear seems to be that the HOH kids won't like the fact that you're hearing, which isn't how it goes here at all - everyone I've ever met is very eager to sign and to teach sign. That particular fear you can for sure throw out, it just doesn't exist here."

Perhaps, if you want to approach this in a not-yourself-centric way you could note that part of ""safer sex"" is accepting our bodies, and part of accepting our bodies is allowing them to be what they are, without needing to hide, deflect, etc. from them. If your name tag is in what would be reasonable place, but that happens to also be upper boob, well, that's just your body. Accepting this and letting it be is part of being comfortable with your body, and allowing others to be comfortable with your body (not making a big deal out of the name tag at all), leads to more body confidence for you AND the people your group works with... which leads to safer sex...

Example: in Starcraft 1, when a hydralisk shoots, he makes a splat noise and a green blob appears on the enemy he's shooting. If you don't already know that hydralisks are ranged units that shoot quills, you would have no idea what was going on, or even that the hydralisk and the splats were connected. That's bad art direction.

In SC2, the hydralisks fire a visible quill that arcs away from them and hits the target. Even if you know nothing about Starcraft, that's a simple, clear action with an obvious analogue to real world experience, and it's easy to see what's happening. That's good art direction. Make sense?"

As a general rule, it should have its own SQL account with permissions only for the types of queries you intend for the application to run, so e.g. it should almost never have drop permissions.

Astraloid,GenderCritical,1390887414.0,"&gt;Well, ""cis"" does not mean ""female"", and ""cis privilege"" is something quite different from ""female privilege""

It's not though. A quick googling of c\*s privilege brings up a list of so-called privileges that c\*s women don't actually have. Rather, it brings up a list of privileges that heteronormative men have, and errantly assumes that women must have them.

&gt;The whole problem here, at its root, is the claim that ""trans women are men"". We both disagree on this, and we will likely never agree, but if you consider the point of view of those who believe that trans women are women, your particular argument falls apart.

The problem with this is that it treats womanhood as an arbitrary marker when it's anything but.  Placing one's self in the definition of womanhood on the basis of an individually constructed, self-referential definition doesn't actually work to change the true circumstances. Beyond that, there's the history of exploitation of women by men which has little to do with whether or not women felt like being women.

&gt;I don't know if I would use the word ""often"", but it certainly sometimes is, which is, to put it mildly, unacceptable in the extreme.

I imagine it's a bit different when one has the term hurled at one on a regular basis.

&gt;I was referring to a similar conversation about the nature of gender, in context of mainstream/intersectional/queer feminism. Hell, even discussions about socialization seem to fall on deaf ears. Except here, that is.

Socrates had also been questioning people his whole life. It's not like he just came to town and they were pissed that he was ""corrupting the youth."" He had been only in Athens his entire life. This corrupting the youth was brought on because he would go around and ask the experts of the day things that they could not answer. There would also be young men who would follow him to learn. This practice was very common. Men who did this were called sophists. The big difference between sophists and Socrates is that the sophists would charge the youth a fee, only rely on their own wisdom and knowledge, and didn't really have a regard for others. Socrates however, would only take donations, he saw himself as wise only because he knew he was not wise and asked others their thoughts on matters. So because these young men were following around Socrates while he was asking experts questions they could not answer, he was making them look foolish in front of the youth of the city. People did not like that for very obvious reasons.

He also didn't mind death. The way he saw it, if there was no life after death, it would be like a peaceful sleep and he wouldn't care. If there was life after death, he would be able to continue his ""mission"" and question the great minds of old. The only thing I don't agree with in /u/canuckfanatic's statement is that he had nobody to look after him. He had many wealthy students including Plato that could take care of him as he got older. "

He seemed like a good enough driver too, he claimed he would have won a WDC because he beat Jenson Button and that year or the next JB won his WDC ;-p not too sure if it would have been the case but who knows. Maybe he meant in F3. Or if he raced in JBs car.   

Now I can't even remember if the driver was Thai or Malaysian.  

**Searched**: Ah it's Malaysian not Thai. Alex Yoong. http://www.f1thailand.com/f1/?p=31 Apparently Bangkok will have a race in 2015.  

http://www.f1rejects.com/interviews/yoong/index.html 

LOL They even wanted to tag him 'worst ever' http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090605085452AAMrqlt But someone said Bernie never qualified for a race LOL. Not sure if that's true. They put Minardi's Zsolt Baumgartner as worst but most consider Yuji Ide as worst ever. Probably been a post on this sub about it.

Still involved in racing/driving. He must have been alright as Lotus made him driver developer in 2009 but it was just for Asia apparently. ESPN and some other channel, ITV I think brought him on as commentator.   

Oh well, he married and divorced a model, a Miss Malaysia even. Proof you don't need to be good looking, just a 'cool' guy that drove in F1. Ugh she's not so good looking either though LOL Her Twitter [account](https://twitter.com/ariannateoh) A small [blog post](http://starbucks87dude.blogspot.com.au/2010/06/alex-yoong-splits-with-his-wife-arianna.html) and a [modelling pic ew](http://www.eastasiafair.com/celebrity/arianna-teoh/)  

Think I might read the [book (The Driver's Line)](http://richardsf1.com/2011/02/24/book-review-alex-yoong-the-drivers-line/) after the other Stig. Who was the best Stig? Ben Collins was alright, he was faster in his audition than the Stig he replaced. 

Anyhow book got 4 checkered flags out of 5 and 4 out of 5 stars http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1DDTHV4YMQX9N/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp  

Basically to drive in F1 you got to be super fast, or just fast enough plus have money/sponsors backing you. 

Next I gotta search on this sub for posts about books and 'worst driver' ;-p "

* * *

&gt;It is utterly infuriating hearing every idiot post ideas that aren't even one-tenth formed as though they were an original and all important thought. I seriously cannot count the number of times I've seen people suggesting we go to Akavir as an entire game with barely more thought out a reason than ""We've seen Tamriel before"" and no understanding of what it would take to set a game there. I've legitimately seen someone suggest we go to First Era Cyrodiil for the next game — which would rewrite history and throw out everything Bethesda has ever built up in the earlier games.

Threads that are based off of and/or include the ideas you highlight are the main reason why I posted this thread. They are plentiful and useless, and do nothing to foster any sort of intelligent discussion. [I wrote a relative novel about my opinion on a game in Akavir and nobody cared.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1kdzl7/where_do_you_want_tes_6_to_take_place_in/cbonc8q?context=3) What got upvotes instead? [Take a good, long look at this high-quality comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1kdzl7/where_do_you_want_tes_6_to_take_place_in/cbnyca6) And all the uninformed circlejerking that followed.

This is an example of what frustrates me so much about the TES: VI threads we've seen so far in /r/ElderScrolls. That is why, in my edit to my original post, I suggest someone set the standard for TES: VI threads in this subreddit. I'm going to start researching to try and do my part, but if someone beats me to it, I won't complain."

(That, and the disability letters that said they *had* to let me use a laptop in class because I can't write; that probably made an impact as well.)

I've also had teachers who clearly had no idea and would *not* have been okay with it if they did know.

I just wish I had more of the former when I was in elementary and middle school and reading books under the desk. Inevitably they figured it out, took the book away, and then yelled at me when I started talking to others.

Don't do what a lot of people do which is set your mind on a specific path and struggle to slog through 4 years of crap just to finally get your degree.

Okay. I enjoy solving puzzles. Really. I can sit all day doing puzzles of any kind. Programming is just solving puzzles. So if you enjoy puzzles, it may be something you'll enjoy.

I got my career started pretty late. I got my first developer job just after turning 36 (I'm now 37). I finished high school dead set on Physics. Ended up in the Navy as an electrician because of terrible grades, then started college thinking I would do Electrical Engineering. Turns out I hated it. Gravitated to the CS program when I realized how much more fun I was having. But, I burned myself out and ended up working on ships for a while again. All the while, I was messing about with learning more programming languages and keeping up with the industry. Then met my wife and taught English in Mexico and Costa Rica for a while. I finally decided to put my degree to good use about 1 1/2 years ago and wish I'd done it 2 decades ago! I've never been happier than I am at my current job.

My point isn't to convince you to do a CS degree. I don't really know what my point is. I guess I just think you shouldn't be so quick to decide what you should be doing without experiencing a few other things first. Hopefully, it doesn't take you 20 years to figure it out like it did me!"

derleth,badhistory,1390887785.0,"&gt; You'll also have to remember that ""liberalism"" in 1930s Britain means something much closer to ""classical liberalism"" than what we think of as liberalism in the present day U.S.

OK then, but the meat of the piece seemed to imply differently.

The only reason I cited Wikipedia is because it conforms to how everyone around me defines liberalism, so saying Wikipedia is out of line is empirically incorrect.

&gt; Capitalism, natural law rights, and republicanism/democracy are all aspects of liberalism's broader project of placing limits on the arbitrary power of the sovereign.

OK, I can see how socialism would disagree with that if socialism demands anarchism.

&gt;  Gøsta Esping-Andersen wrote an insightful book, The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, which detailed and explained conservative, liberal, and socialist approaches to state welfare provision.

I'll have to look this up.

&gt; I think both liberalism and socialism have areas of overlap, but they arrive at those shared areas of concern from different ontological/normative starting points and with a different normative outcomes in mind.

OK then. I have little patience for ideological hair-splitting when both sides agree to all the same policies. It's like the interminable slap-fight between Anarcho-Capitalists and Anarcho-Syndicalists: They both want the same dystopic nightmare, so the reasons *why* are completely unimportant unless you've bought into their idiocy.

&gt; As far as being a socialist in a democracy, go ahead and vote. Socialism claims democracy as one of its values. Should you waste a vote on the American Communist Party? Probably not. Does that make you a bad socialist? 

I'm not a socialist unless you're Glenn Beck.

States can't develop without agriculture, but agriculture itself does not lead to writing. And there are many societies that were fully agricultural and had advanced agricultural technology (like large irrigation works) but never developed writing.

But I'm still confused by your questions about language. Language as we know it likely developed around 70,000 years ago and all hunter-gatherers have languages that are just as fully-formed and complex as any around today. And a hunter-gatherer community might only have 20-50 people that live together but they would not be isolated, they would have regular contact with other communities who were culturally very similar and spoke the same languages. So each individual community might not have more than 100 people, but they would trade, interact, intermarry, etc. within their society and the society could have tens or hundreds of thousands of people speaking the same language or close dialects.

Now that I'm an adult living in my own home, I regularly cook Italian and Indian inspired food, and a year ago, I bought an authentic Chinese wok (the full dome, not that flat bottomed rubbish) so that I could start working out how to cook my own Chinese style food.

SloppySynapses,leagueoflegends,1390887989.0,"go play one of those reaction games. you will be anywhere from 100-400 ms on average (I think 250 or 300 is average). intentionally slow your average speed down by 50 ms or 100 ms. it's not hard to do because 50 ms is a lot 'slower' than we think. it's really fast, yes, but you can still detect the difference if you have good rhythm

ever flashed a ziggs ult? a nid ult? any skillshot? think about every time you BARELY got hit but your model still flashed. if you had even just 50 less ping than you did then, you wouldn't have died.

imagine how often that happens and it's a big deal just for those specific scenarios. That's not even considering every single time you have to dodge something by moving and aren't quick enough to react by 50 ms. 

Think about it this way, your champion has ~100 unit hitbox. If you travel 400 units per second and you react 100 ms late because of ping, that's almost half your hitbox that suffers because of your ping. 

Also, of course you haven't had a problem with it because you've never played at 20 ping. Go play at 20 ping and tell me there's no difference. It's not absolutely gamechanging, but it's a significant difference for sure. No one is going to say ""I don't care which one it is"" if they've legitimately played at both 20 ms and 90 ms ping because EVERYONE can tell the difference.

I can tell the difference from 68 to 110 ping really easily (2 different internet connections I use) and that's just 40."

*steps up on soapbox*

Forget the 'logic' of it for a second. I'm going to present a normative argument here. The minimum wage is essentially a decision made by society regarding how we want the quality of life for a large segment of the population to be. We are free to condemn our fellow countrymen to poverty, or we can decide to offer them a livable salary. It is up to us whether their lives are lived in comfort, or in pain.

The country I want to see, that I want to live in, and that I want to contribute to is one where no matter your lot in life, your misfortunes, bad choices, or disabilities, you have a fighting chance. Maybe you can't fight your way out of whatever life has dealt you. Fine, it happens. But if you can dedicate yourself to good, honest work, putting in your own effort into your job, no matter what it is, I believe that you should be rewarded with the means to live in a state of relative comfort. 

Call it kindness, call it empathy, call it stupidity, I don't really care. If this country can survive while paying its workers a decent wage, then I believe it should. Because that's the Canada I want to live in.

ecclectic,Welding,1390888045.0,"Chop saws are rarely *really* accurate.  +/- 2-3 degrees isn't uncommon, but when you're cutting 10', 2 degrees is a BIG deal.

If you want accurate cuts, invest in a good cold cut saw.  Failing that, make sure you're buying good blades, *not* abrasive blades, but actual cutting blades.  Ensure your collets are tight, and that the blade and base are 90 degrees from each other and double check that your 45 marker is actually 45 degrees from the blade and backrest.

Good tools cost good money.  What you pay for up front saves you money on not wasting time in fitting/welding.

""Work Clothes and Uniforms

You can deduct the cost and upkeep of work clothes if the following two requirements are met.

You must wear them as a condition of your employment.

The clothes are not suitable for everyday wear.



It is not enough that you wear distinctive clothing. The clothing must be specifically required by your employer. Nor is it enough that you do not, in fact, wear your work clothes away from work. The clothing must not be suitable for taking the place of your regular clothing.
Examples of workers who may be able to deduct the cost and upkeep of work clothes are: delivery workers, firefighters, health care workers, law enforcement officers, letter carriers, professional athletes, and transportation workers (air, rail, bus, etc.).

Musicians and entertainers can deduct the cost of theatrical clothing and accessories that are not suitable for everyday wear.

However, work clothing consisting of white cap, white shirt or white jacket, white bib overalls, and standard work shoes, which a painter is required by his union to wear on the job, is not distinctive in character or in the nature of a uniform. Similarly, the costs of buying and maintaining blue work clothes worn by a welder at the request of a foreman are not deductible.

Protective clothing.   You can deduct the cost of protective clothing required in your work, such as safety shoes or boots, safety glasses, hard hats, and work gloves.
  Examples of workers who may be required to wear safety items are: carpenters, cement workers, chemical workers, electricians, fishing boat crew members, machinists, oil field workers, pipe fitters, steamfitters, and truck drivers.
Military uniforms.   You generally cannot deduct the cost of your uniforms if you are on full-time active duty in the armed forces. However, if you are an armed forces reservist, you can deduct the unreimbursed cost of your uniform if military regulations restrict you from wearing it except while on duty as a reservist. In figuring the deduction, you must reduce the cost by any nontaxable allowance you receive for these expenses.
  If local military rules do not allow you to wear fatigue uniforms when you are off duty, you can deduct the amount by which the cost of buying and keeping up these uniforms is more than the uniform allowance you receive.
  You can deduct the cost of your uniforms if you are a civilian faculty or staff member of a military school."""

FuckingLoveArborDay,actuary,1390888246.0,"So do we really speak as though self driving cars are an inevitability?  I still don't see who is going to buy these.

I don't think non affluent people would even consider such an investment.

Also, what is the point again?  I always thought the inconvenience was the time spent in commute, not the fact that you had to drive.

You rant about people making sweeping statements based on uninformed opinions while making incorrect assumptions about my life experience and building your whole argument upon that. You sound like some little shit who just needs an excuse to feel indignant in every context. I identified myself as a suburban white guy so you can move past my ""privilege"" from the get go and we can proceed with a civil, meaningful conversation. Shit, I even presented it in a humble, self abasing manner. In retrospect it seems I was expecting a lot from you. That one little statement about me means very little. It does **not** mean that I haven't spent a significant portion of my time over the last several years in one of the country's most impoverished cities. There are a lot of things you seem to have gleaned from that one statement that are just so singularly wrong. You must feel so righteous telling people how uninformed they are. What a joke.

Moving on, you're arguing against the opinion that black pop culture, specifically hip hop, has damaging effects on the collective mind set of black people (particularly in inner city and/or low income areas). And you chose as your example... fucking Oakland and Atlanta? Are you *trying* to weaken your point? If I'm not mistaken, Oakland is the home of Tupac: the man who popularized ""thug life"" and inspired a lot of the styles that comprise gangster rap. Oakland also produced Too Short, who is famous for overt and outrageous mysogyny. Those are the only two Oakland rappers who immediately come to mind as famous enough to be considered pop culture. Still with me? Atlanta has produced the following giants of social progression: Waka Flocka Flame, Ludacris, Soulja Boy, Jermaine Dupri, Lil' Jon, nationally publicized illegal gun convict T.I., Gucci Mane, a dozen or so morons whose names begin with some 'creative' misspelling of the word young, and my personal favorite, the Ying Yang Twins. I'm not going to explain to you the significance of all of these people. If you're familiar with hip hop, you'll know where I'm going with this... unless you're someone who watched a World Star video and made an assumption about all black people based on that. Cute passive aggressive dig, by the way. You're a real mensa. 

Now, Atlanta has also produced people like BoB and Outkast. But they are sorely outnumbered by their louder, simpler, ignorance celebrating, violence and drug trade glorifying counterparts. And Oakland has produced people like Del the Funkee Homosapien, Heiroglyphics, and if I'm not mistaken, the Grouch (he might not even be black. I don't know.), but they are obscure, underground acts and therefore not pop culture. Because hip hop in pop culture is largely focused on promoting negativity.

&gt;What fundamentally irks me about this shitty website is folks who openly profess to having no exposure to a culture making grand, sweeping generalizations about it like they're some kind of fucking expert (as you did, even if you phrased it in more polite terms than OP). Step back and think about the historical context and contemporary representations (no mainstream hip-hop artist, by the way, does much of anything you suggested, which speaks to your lack of knowledge) before you decide to pontificate.

What fundamentally irks me about you social justice bellyachers is your universal assumption that anyone who disagrees with you or forgoes your rigid, pretentious politically correct social mores is some form of bigot, or at best, just ininformed, ignorant, and presumptuous. As it happens, the world is your mirror in this instance. And I happen to be some kind of fucking expert on hip hop. I spent half my life rapping as an active part of the scene until I went and got a career path.  Several years thereof was spent hanging out and performing in inner city venues amongst *gasp* black people. Fuck your opinion and your self righteous indignation."

orbitur,CanadaPolitics,1390888685.0,"&gt; On average, every Walmart store in the US is responsible for sucking up $1 million of taxpayers' money, indirectly, through their employees having to be on food stamps or Medicaid.

Sorry, if it wasn't Wal-Mart, those employees would be split amongst several smaller chains and mom&amp;pop shops earning minimum wage.  I don't know why everyone thinks unskilled workers were making double minimum wage before WallyWorld came along.

This is also ignoring that Wal-Mart is one of the few places you can go to earn more than minimum wage in the States.  Not sure about Canada, as it's run slightly different up here."

Kayden01,AskReddit,1390888690.0,"With the way most of the industry works (I have some experience, though not as a performer) being entirely blacklisted by one company has damn near no effect on any others. Many of the companies rarely talk to each other, and many of the owners have issues with each other, and would be rather pleased to be making money off a performer that a rival couldn't work with. It's all very much an ego thing, and the industry is a long *long* way from monolithic when it comes to individual performers.

In my experience, any performer with a claim for rape/forcible participation/fraud etc - any of the complaints made, gets a very serious hearing from police, not because the cops care, but because the company has a number of assets with high monetary value that can be seized if they were used in a crime, and cops are very interested in that. It's one of the reasons that companies do pre interviews and post interviews, because when your property is seized, you have to prove that it *wasn't* used in the commission of a crime.

Given that the FA guy has been in business for 10ish years, if he was really pushing the limits the way this claim says - he'd be done - multiple property seizures, multiple jail terms. There is a fair amount of dodgy stuff that still goes on in the business, but to the levels claimed? I doubt it - and if so, I'd expect it to be a one off. 

That's all based on my personal experiences with people in similar positions though, not the specific people listed."

desolee,asianamerican,1390889112.0,"I was in the ensemble, so prostitute/beggar/random lady.  I did get called back for Eponine, but the girl who got it is truly amazing so only tiny hard feelings, heh.  I quite enjoy theater and the lack of diversity is hard to digest sometimes.  I literally get excited any time I see someone Asian in the ensemble.  Theater is so white from every aspect, from the cast to the audience as well.  Sometimes there are actual opportunities for Asian actors- Chinglish, for example, by David Henry Hwang- but otherwise it's so discouraging.  

It also reminds me of when I saw Madame Butterfly at the Met Opera, which is a story about a Japanese woman... and the actress was white.  And almost everybody in it was white.  I don't think I saw a single Asian person.  There was another actress who played the lead that was indeed Asian, but she wasn't on the night we went.  Literally yellowface though, and I seemed to be the only person who felt it was controversial at all."

Tire wear and strategy are going to be huge, that front left really takes a beating and will ruin your race if you can't keep it under control.

There's plenty of places to make clean overtakes, but that final sector is really prone to mistakes and will bring the pack back together, and wheel-to-wheel action there can very likely end in disaster so we'll see how that goes.

TotallyNotSuperman,batman,1390889153.0,"&gt;His 'No person should have such power' and 'the fate of men is their own' style reasoning for his hatred of Superman is perfectly valid and understandable.

Sure, if it wasn't total bullpoop. He's only upset that one man has that much power because he's not the top dog. It's not ""no person should have such power."" It's ""I should be the one with that much power."" And he's smart enough that, if he wanted, he could put Earth on par with Krypton within his lifetime. But he'd rather attack Superman than actually do anything to help.

From your comment, I suspect you've read *Lex Luthor: Man of Steel*. What's important is that it's written from the viewpoint of a villain trying to sell himself as a good guy. If you get the chance, read it again. And pay attention to all of the horrible, horrible things Lex does instead of what he's telling you he's doing.

For me, I thought Luthor was a bad guy before I read *Lex Luthor*. After I read it, I thought he might have a bit of a point, but was going about it the wrong way. The second time I read it, I realized that he was actually a really fucking awful human being.

*Just being able to voice your opinion sufficiently and effectively is good.* Sufficiently???   Clearly maybe, but sufficiently? 

then add a paragraph break before mentioning you can be cynical.. if you have to mention that you can be cynical at all.

**What I am doing with my life**

joining the workforce?  how about work force? or better yet ""getting a job"" 

**I'm really good at**
Learning and education are faily reduntant and saying you're good at education is just wrong.  Perhaps you mean educating others?

pretty good.. but dialect?  perhaps you're saying you have an accent?

*I critically think, so be ready to not just talk about the weather with me.*  yea.. no.   I critically think.  That's not the same as saying you're a critical thinker and neither of those inform the reader what thinking critically means or why it is a desirable trait.   rework

**Typical Friday**
Not bad... hopefully they will as or know what a zerg is.

it's titled the most private thing you're willing to admit, not the most private thing ever.. if the most private thing you'd be willing to admit is that your mom cooks better pasta than steak, put that, but otherwise you certainly are not the first, nor will you be the last to say you're not willing to admit anything.

Just click add to cart as complete and you can select what you want.  You can check the box below depending on whether you want it assembled and shipped, or shipped with all the parts in a box for you to put together.

You can get some Bones Reds for the bearings, Thunder Lo trucks (or Independent or Venture if you prefer), and Bones or Spitfire wheels, Bones 100's are good if you can't afford the Bones STF, Spitfire Classics are good too but they flatspot easier.  Get between 50-54mm for street.  For grip go with Mob or Jessup, Mob is more grippy but lasts longer.  Hardware doesn't really matter, anything 1"" is fine.  Risers aren't really needed unless you get wheels larger than 54mm (on Low trucks at least, you can use bigger wheels without risers on High trucks as opposed to Low).

deananana,AskWomenOver30,1390889343.0,"I've been dating on and off since i was a teenager, and i'm now 37. So: the main things that are different is that everyone is more confidently themselves. There's less pretending to be someone you're not, or like things you don't, just to attract or impress someone. As I moved into my mid 30s, people became a lot more honest and straightforward about what they wanted - be that a relationship or casual sex or something in between. Men started to admit that they were looking for emotional intimacy, companionship, and cuddling on the couch. I've gotten more aware that I want those things too. 

Everyone gets more cynical and experienced, and i'm hardly ever surprised when something does or doesn't work out. 

With sex, i went through a phase from my mid twenties to my very early 30s where i was pretty casual with sex; as i've gotten older i've become more aware that i enjoy sex more when it's with someone i care about, and i've gotten more selective as i've gotten older. Surprisingly, it seems that lots of men have gone through the same evolution. 

Things that haven't really changed as much as i'd expected: the stuff at the beginning of dating. I've seriously sat around with friends going over texts trying to figure out if he likes me or is going to ask me out again or why he hasn't called back when he said he'd call back. "

The fiberglass handle is a big plus,  the problem that comes up with handles on those tools is when you miss and the handle smashes on what you're trying to bash.  Wood handles fray in no time, but the illustrations you found have rubber things to cushion any stray mis-hits.  

**However.** Don't forget for a second that you are dealing serious shocks to much of your body - shoulders, neck, bottom of the spine, even hips.  They are taking the recoil every time and it is not for someone who is out of condition, or who has any arthritis or whatever. 

If you must do this, I suggest you buy also one of those wide elastic support belts that you pass around your lower abdomen and fasten with velcro.  At least that will hold your lumbar region together while you smash things.  

Sorry if I sound over-concerned.  The pain of injury can last YEARS.  I know from personal experience.  It costs you sleep, it costs you play time, it costs you snappishness, it's really not worth it.  

Consider parking the damn car until things warm up.  (Grin) Or take the other guy's advice and buy a tiger-torch, I guess.  I have no experience with them, but it sounds like fun with pyromania.

TotallyNotSuperman,batman,1390889596.0,"It's a funny video, but I think it places far too much blame on the story. It's not the fault of the book that death became so meaningless; it did it rather well, I think. The tragedy of the event was there, and the importance of the return was also there.

The problem is that other writers saw that story, and thought ""that sold a lot of books, so I should do it too."" The first cannot be blamed for the sins of the copycats who lazily imitate the original. It's wrong to blame *The Dark Knight Returns* and *Watchmen* for the overly grim 90's comics that followed suit, and for the same reason, it's wrong to put all the blame of *The Death and Return of Superman* for the inability to keep characters dead.

Everything, from the arrival of Doomsday to the final victory over the impostors, was made important.

*The Death and Return of Superman* is not the best story ever written. Far from it, in fact. But it certainly is not guilty of making death ""not a big deal."" That is the fault of those who followed in its footsteps."

My chin and shirt get soaked on average once a day, more if I'm drinking while watching something or listening to someone talk. And pizza. I have stained many shirts by missing the edge of the pizza leading to horrible loss of pizza toppings onto my shirt.

And it's not like I can't balance entirely. I've gotten pretty good at weaving when walking to avoid bumping into things, but the moment I'm not actively balancing I'm just a mess. I've gotten wounds on my upper arms from bumping into things that I should have never even touched while walking through somewhere. All because I took one step, and suddenly my upper body wasn't where I expected it to be.

However, Bill, as we called him, was the sweetest cat on Earth despite his massive size. He was a stray that my brother and I fed on our way to school one day and next thing you know he's living in our computer chair. 

I will never forget when my family was moving from Oregon to Arizona and we stopped at a Home Depot because there was a grassy, but shaded area near the store where we could picnic. The other cats we had had to stay in their carriers, but we knew Bill wouldn't take off so we let him out where he promptly took a few steps from the carrier and plopped down to take a nap in the grass. 

I sat their with my kitty cat, having a sandwich and before I knew it people, customers and employees alike, were filing out of the store to take a look at this massive cat. 

Some people were scared of him, but it didn't take much convincing on Bill's part for them pet him and OH BOY did he soak up the attention. I could tell when we had to leave he was as heartbroken to say good bye to his new friends as they were.

liimlsan,AskReddit,1390889792.0,"This is hilariously ironic and I really hate to tell it because it doesn't sound even real, it sounds like MRA fantasy, but I became a feminist after being falsely accused of attempted rape.

There was a skype conversation (skype was new, we were all being cool using it) in the 9th grade, where basically me and 10 guys from the class were sharing typical horrible jokes of the type 14-year-old-boys have been doing since time immemorial. ""What's the best part about sex with seventy two year olds?"" That sort of thing. At one point, a couple of guys made rape jokes involving a girl in the class, not knowing she was watching the exchange.

She thought it was a threat, and called the school office. After five rounds of cross-blaming, the buck fell into my lap for ""putting them up to it"" or some shit like that - they had a patsy, that's all that mattered. I was grounded for a time and suspended for a few days.

What killed me was the attitude literally everyone took about it. The counselor assumed I had a crush on her (I never even brought her up in the conversation) and reassured me that ""teenage girls, they're all like that, she'll forget in a week."" Even before we looked at the evidence, the board had these looks of 'let's get this over with.' Her best friend reassured me that she was on her period during that particular weekend. She thought she was in danger of being raped and no one even tried to even comfort her about it. I just avoided her for three years to keep from triggering (and even coming out of the closet didn't help with that).

A few more years, I'm a pretty thick feminist... you don't get to see rape culture firsthand until you're trapped in it.

* First and foremost, women’s bodies and sexuality vary widely. Some women feel unfulfilled without significant penetration and others don’t want it at all. Some women can orgasm from peno-vaginal intercourse (“PIV”) alone but most can’t.

* I’m skeptical that any woman can orgasm from PIV without *any* clitoral stimulation as the clitoral body extends far beyond the clitoral glans (what we can see and palpate),¹ so I’m not sure how someone would demonstrate vaginal orgasm without clitoral involvement. Even so, what’s your point? A minority of women have been known to orgasm from nipple stimulation, backrubs, and even from having their elbows rubbed.²

* I have *never* anywhere read or heard even an *insinuation* that a woman who finds PIV with a larger penis has mental health issues. Do you subscribe to *Small Penis Quarterly* or something?

1. *See, e.g.*, Shere Hite, *The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality* 145 (Seven Stories 2003) (1976) (“‘The truth is . . . . that the glans and shaft of the human clitoris are merely the superficially visible or palpable manifestation of an underlying *clitoral system* which is at least as large, as responsive, and as functionally responsive as the penis—and which responds as a unit to sexual stimulation in much the same way that the penis does.’” (quoting Edward Brecher, *The Sex Researchers* 220 (Signet Books 1969)).

Please understand the basic laws of toxicology before saying things like this. Anything and EVERYTHING can be, and is dangerous or deadly. It all depends on the dosage.

For example, you take in about 1,000x the amount of mercury from a can of tuna. Aspartame is in everything from gum to diet soda and I bet you don't thnk twice.

cokeisahelluvadrug,investing,1390889909.0,"Warren Buffet is a longtime advocate of numerology. He's talked about how double numbers nearly always mean that a company is undervalued, and triple numbers mean it's time to get out. Another famous example of a ""Buffet Number"" is a staircase number, e.g. $123.45. Essentially when you see a staircase number you know the trend will continue -- $123.45 will become $1,234.56, and $65.43 will become $6.54. As you can see the trend starts to disappear once you get into lower-valued stocks -- that's why penny stocks are so derided in this sub, because intelligent investors have no ""staircase indicators"" (industry jargon, sorry) to watch for.

There's a lot of different patterns that you can witness with the markets, but I don't think anyone is as good at spotting trends as Buffett."

tPRoC,malefashionadvice,1390890187.0,"Gonna have to disagree with this one, kind of. While fit is important, I think this is a *super unproductive* way to look at it. A lot of people end up shoehorning themselves in to this mentality of ""Clothes should fit a certain way"" and it limits them hugely.

My biggest difficulty was realizing that things don't have to fit perfect. They just really don't- especially if we're talking about casual clothes. Up to a point, most people just aren't going to notice. I didn't wear [this jacket](http://i.imgur.com/4sM1Kpe.png) for the longest time because it wasn't slim. Same thing with [this jacket.](http://i.imgur.com/VoZT4R8.png)

It took me months before I actually bought a button-down shirt because I thought everything I tried on was [""too billowy""](http://i.imgur.com/KKdVhQ1.png) or too long, or with too much sleeve length or something like that. In reality, they look as good as they're going to look on my physique given my proportions. And as long as they fit reasonably well (you might run in to some problems with styling if your shirt fits like Jerry Seinfeld's) it's not that big of a deal- most people won't even notice. 

It took me way too long to realize this, but fit really needs to be judged on a case by case basis. I think it was when I first started lurking Sufu that I realized this. A lot of them wear clothes that are [billowy,](http://i.imgur.com/CuVDx60.png) shirts that are [""too long"",](http://i.imgur.com/36K0xJ3.png) pants that are [""baggy"",](http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9d/88/f5/9d88f599160f37cbc55d133c28239874.jpg) and tees that [hang strangely and have ""huge"" armholes.](http://i.imgur.com/kr0BXoi.jpg) It'd be super easy to obsess over this stuff, but sometimes this stuff is what makes a fit look natural, and sometimes what elevates it from ""alright"" to ""exceptional""."

So I had a dream that I went into a random souvenir shop and I saw a cool pair of random black sunglasses so I went up with them to the cashier and the total was .69 cents. So I reach into my pocket but I only had .45 cents. So I started looking in the rest of my pockets for more money but I didn't have anything. Then for whatever reason I had silver dollar coins on me (much like the Israeli 1₪ 2₪ 5₪ coins.) and hello, they had the emblem of a CHICKEN on them. The bigger coins had a large chicken head with no body and the smaller coins has a small chicken silhouette on them with a full body. So I needed to pay her 15 chicken dollars but idk why because the price on the screen said .69 cents. Either way, while in counting the money I picked up the glasses to try them on in the mirror again and then suddenly they were children's Spider-Man themed glasses.

CORNDOGCOMMANDO,AskReddit,1390890345.0,"well both were drug addicts after my dad died of an overdose my mom went full druggie prostitute abandoning her 3 kids.

didn't really feel anything for my dad since i was so young and as for my mom...i really had a good laugh when my aunt demanded i come see her in the hospital before she passes away.

my mom walked out on me, i wasn't even 10 yet kind of forgotten how old i was since you don't really care about birthdays when your homeless and starving, she put us through hell using us for welfare and to steal from us when we got older. 

as soon as i turned 18 i tried to bury the hatchet but she denied everything and disowned me, i warned her to watch what she says but she still went on about not having a son and that i should get out and never come back. 

you got it mom so long and fuck you that was in the 90s fast forward to around 2007 and i get a phone call from my aunt who says my mom is on her death bed and i need to come make amends LOL

i chuckled on the phone and said there is no way i'm wasting another second on that woman after all shes done and that's how i became the black sheep of the family. that bitch had no right to demand time from her kids, the way i see it she stole our childhoods and teen years forcing us to become adults before we even hit puberty. 

so to summarize yes they deserved to die and i hope they burn in hell.


oh fun fact the rumor going around some family is that after they forced her off all the drugs she was still on and off of pain killers she finally came to her senses and realized she had fucked up, the rumor is that's all she kept saying as she was dying oh my god i fucked up, i fucked up so bad.

I'm not totally comfortable with it yet, but that discomfort — stemming from little time to strategize before acting; indeed, it's strategizing in motion — is the most irritating part. I've had to embrace that awkwardness isn't a crime, I'm more likely to err if I second-guess myself, and that I'm unlikely to make a terrible and irrevocable mistake just because I'm being more or less spontaneous. 

Participating in low-prep group activities has helped me with thinking on my feet and working fast. I'll go to the kinds of volunteer or sports meet-ups where you receive instructions on the fly and have a limited amount of time to do your thing, often while cooperating with strangers. It could be picking scholarship recipients, leading tours, taking a mechanics class or going for a mass bike ride or run — it'll test you, and you won't fail. 

Observing and modeling after other people who seem to thrive in those types of situations has helped me, too. But lately I'm being cautious not to force myself to act like an extrovert just because they appear successful (and comfortable) working a room or managing a fresh challenge; I believe we can use Se successfully as introverts, without totally draining ourselves in the process.

griffer00,offmychest,1390890569.0,"As an older brother, your post really rattled me. I feel like I have to say something here. Straight up, I completely respect your feelings, so my intention isn't to invalidate you at all -- I just want to add some perspective.

Alcoholism does have genetic components to it. Specifically, some people's brains respond to alcohol as if it were a meal following a long fast -- in short, some people's brains prioritize the satisfaction of drinking in a way that will highly, highly increase the probability of problematic drinking. This can be passed-down across generations, or result from random via accumulated mutations. I should know because I used to research the neurophysiology of alcoholism. 

The fact that your twin brothers -- both sharing the same environment and DNA -- succumbed to the long-term effects of the disease should speak wonders as to the strength of reward-related biology. They each watched their clone make poor choices despite the clear negative impact on their lives and those of their loved ones. Their brains' biology unfairly coaxed them into prioritizing alcohol over everything, including life itself. 

Similarly, we know that cigarette smoke is carcinogenic. Would you also feel angry if your brothers both bartended, for years, in smokey pubs? Sure, they had a choice not to work there... but what if that was the only way they could make money (e.g. no education, poor market)? In alcoholism, you also have choices. Yes, you can stop drinking, but the same drives that will us toward sex, food, and water are working against that decision. For some people, their brains' biology wills them toward this protracted form of suicide.

Is it selfish for them to drink themselves to death, with their families watching? Yes. That's the name of the game with biological drives -- they ensure an individual's survival, not that of others. Unfortunately, drives always trump cognition at the end of the day. You only have limited endurance for cognition; on the other hand, your ability to follow drives is limited only by your body's ability to move and respond in the environment. Prolonged alcohol use also destroys areas of the brain needed for the cognitive stamina required to override base drives. So, again, drives beat the shit out of common sense in this situation. 

Notice that I'm not discounting your feelings. I got into alcohol research after watching 11 alcoholics in my life fuck their shit up. None to an extent that you've described, so in this regard, I can hardly imagine how you must feel. I'm an older brother myself, and it would break my heart to know that  my selfishness could engender such resentment and disappointment from my younger brother. Then again, if I drank myself to death, it would be hard to defend against that... I would need to expect and respect those feelings. Then again, if I was an alcoholic, my brain would be telling me that it's a choice between letting everyone down vs. drinking water to stay alive. It's a tough choice to make.

 I know you likely feel that your brothers' choices suggested to you that you don't matter to them. You do, but their brains are fucked up -- they lost the biological basis for prioritzing facets of their lives the same way a person with Alzheimer's loses the biological ability to regulate their memory. Since this all happens in the brain, it's very frustrating -- it observationally appears to have been preventable. To some extent, it was -- if they lived in a culture where they were never exposed to alcohol, they'd have been fine. To some extent, it wasn't. Would you blame someone with cancer for being exposed to the same carcinogens we all contact each day?

In any case, be angry and be sad. Learn from their mistakes. You're losing another important person in your life, and the helplessness of it would rattle even the most hardass of humans. But before your other big bro goes, please try to go easy on him. He's scared, and probably even ashamed, that his choices ruined his life, and messed up the lives of his loved ones. He won't tell you this, of course, because he's your older brother. We try to look tough in front of our younger brothers. If I were him, I would want nothing more than to be around my younger brother before exiting this mortal coil. "
enna_,weddingplanning,1390890571.0,"Lucky for you (maybe lol), my first floral job was in Connecticut, just a hop skip and a jump south of MA!

Not so lucky, flowers out east are very expensive. $3-4k on flowers, sadly, isn't completely unreasonable in cities out east.  

I live in a medium sized city and can tell you $1-2k is an excellent budget for around where I am. We just recently did a HUGE wedding in our convention center, with a big ol' wedding party... It came to a little over $2k. That was much larger than the wedding you plan on, probably.

------

So let me imagine your wedding as VERY traditional, as a wedding planning website would imagine you to have. I mean no offense by anything that follows... :D I will base my prices on my experience in Connecticut, rather than my current location.

*Everyone is seated at the beautiful ceremony with the end chairs adorned with beautiful flowers($25x20), the moms($30x2) and groom's dad($15), the grandmas ($20x2) and the grandpas($10x2), the sisters($25x2) and brothers($15x2) all in the front there. They are all smiling, waiting for the beautiful bride to walk down there in the middle with her bouquet($150). Oh! Here comes the ring bearer($10) and the flower girl(petals $20)! Look at how cute they are, stealing the show! Dang, so cute!! Oh, there comes the bride, there with her dad($15). Pretty gown, pretty hair($10)! Wow! The music is playing, the musician($15) playing the keyboard away, and then when it slows as the bride approaches the groom($15), the officiant($15) begins his portion. The bridesmaids all begin to cry ($65x5), the Best Man($15) smiles for his friend. People start crying, and the I Do's are said, yay kiss the bride between two big church-style arrangements($200x2)! ........... Here's the reception! Everyone walks in-- holy moly! 10 whole tables with-- what kind of flowers ARE those!? That's amazing!($60x9) Everyone sits and starts chatting. The wedding party sits at their special table($75) and talking so highly of the beautiful bride and the handsome groom- the newly weds! Everyone toasts, eats, then WOW the cake($40), look at that-- how do we even eat it? (lol) ----- Then that whole tossing thing...$40. I never quite figured that one out.*

**That story was kinda exaggerated for an average medium-sized wedding out east: $2400+$100 for set up/consultations/labor**

----


NOW! YOUR WEDDING? Here's my realistic idea of what you should expect. Please don't take my word for it, as I no longer live in an expensive place.

**Wedding party:**
Bride: $150 -- Groom: $15-20 -- Best Man: $15-20 -- 4 Bridesmaids: $80 x 4 -- Moms: $30 &amp; Dads: $15 -- Siblings are equal to parents. Don't forget your musician($25female, $15male) and officiant($15)     
**$600 including 4 parents**, $675 including musician, officiant, 1xSister&amp;Brother

**Reception:**
""Small"": $50 at least x 10 -- Tossing bouquet: $50     
**$550**

**Ceremony:**
Chair bouquets: $25 x 8
**$200**

**Total according to enna_** = $1,425 at the most imo

By my guestimates, your number should be completely reasonable. Could you send me the link you were looking at that said $2-3k? I mean, I believe it... but your wedding is YOUR wedding. Not the internet's. Your numbers will differ from everyone's. :) You're looking at a very reasonably priced wedding, if it were me as your florist!! **PLEASE don't use my numbers, don't quote me! I am very new to the field in comparison to most of the florists you will talk to!!** :)

Tips to save! (Keep these in the back of your mind when you consider your flowers!)

* Use your own vases. Buy something fun like old tin cans (http://i.imgur.com/6O6IxcJ.jpg). Often, these can be found at antique stores and I've done a wedding in them- they look so fun and amazing. If you aren't into this style, buy vases at the dollar store. If you are just wanting plain cylindrical vases, Dollar Tree is your friend. I've also seen nice small wooden boxes brought in, and blue mason jars. This all is likely to save you a few dollars per arrangement (or alternatively, allow the florist to spend more money on flowers.)

* If the florist has to use floral foam in your arrangements- the price is probably going to be $5-10 more expensive. This is unavoidable, and very worth it. Just keep in mind , if you say you want to spend $50 on your centerpieces, $10 will be subtracted for the ""labor""/cost that goes into foam, and $8 or whatever for the vase, leaving only $32 for flowers. Not exact, but you get the idea.

* See about renting vases the florist might have. I know at my shop we have ~20 bubble bowls and ~20 40cm glass cylindrical vases on hand.

* I don't suggest this if you are aiming for fancy but remember you can save money by aiming for lower end flowers, which can look just as good. If you want to use carns, baby's breath, poms, alstromeria!, etc, ask about things that ""add value"" such as [curly willow](http://i.imgur.com/d8J4Np9.jpg) or [bear grass](http://i.imgur.com/77JLaex.jpg). These add 'volume' and look expensive.  :)

* Order from a mom &amp; pop shop-- You'll get more people like me wanting to help! hehe

* For things like calla lilies, that have perfect replicas at Hobby Lobby for 1/2 off the normal $4 price or whatever, or Michael's, ask your florist if you can bring in some faux flowers for them to add. In my opinion, calla lilies aren't worth it anyways, the fake ones look the same if they have that rubbery feel. Make up an excuse if it is important enough, ""But my best friend just did her flowers with these and we've been close since childhood and I promised her..."" Of course, that is if you are insistent and need to cut corners lol.

* If you are really trying to cut dollars: Don't fall for their [rhinestone](http://i.imgur.com/0zmKvQ3.jpg) tricks! They will charge you $10-$20 more on a bouquet to include them. You can buy them yourself and hot glue 'em in there for like $5 or less, and do all your girlfriend's too! (This only goes for bouquets with rhinestones on the roses-- boutonnieres and corsages are much more difficult and are better left to the florist to do.)

I have more corners to cut- like all sorts of things to tell ya... Let me know if you need more! Sorry for long winded answer!"

Some of the virgin shaming out there is inexcusable. Hell, most of it is.

The reason it is used as an insult, I think, is that they think it's hypocritical for someone with little to no experience in sexual interactions to speak knowledgeably about sex. For someone who has had little to no sex, why should someone listen to their advice/wisdom about sex? Or for someone who has had only/overwhelmingly poor experience in love to give dating advice. 

Also, for those who aren't sexually frustrated, sex might not seem like that big a deal, not something worth getting flustered about. So they don't understand why someone else would be so single-minded or passionate about having sex. It's a lack of empathy. "

savoytruffle,AskReddit,1390891004.0,"At the time (10 years ago) I relied mostly on Lonely Planet books, and some websites. The web will be a much better resource nowadays. Lonely Planet has been trying to do a group travel site, I think, but there is also Wiki Voyage and etc.

At the time I was also pretty trusting of internet cafes for internet stuff including banking and uploading pictures and journals. Nowadays computer security especially on Windows is such a fiasco that I would probably only trust my own computer or tablet or like iPod Touch, at least for important things.

I'm a pretty tall guy (6'2-6'3"") so I never felt particularly threatened in most countries. There were women traveling alone, but surely not as many as you'd meet men. Also nearly every other person sort of backpacking around was from Australia or Europe (mainly UK, Netherlands, Germany) or Israel, or even Canada. Basically no Americans.

I didn't have a big plan to start with. I first flew to visit my friend in Hong Kong (JFK&gt;Narita&gt;Hong Kong) and stayed at a drafty hostel there. Then he took about a week off and we both flew to Bangkok to explore for a while. Then he went back to teaching English in Hong Kong and I set off to see what I could see.

Lodging was very cheap in Southeast Asia. Less than $10 US per night anywhere for a private room (not a great one) with usually a shared bathroom somewhere. Often around $6 but again this was in the past. Cheapest was $2 US in Mandalay for a private room with a private bathroom. But that was lucky since I got food poisoning or something and spent a lot of time in the bathroom.

I mainly got around by bus and train with occasional short flights. To get to southern Cambodia I used a shared taxi since there's not really any other way to do it.

Nowadays there is some political turmoil in Bangkok and Phnom Penh. I think it's still do-able. The only country where I checked in with the US State Department was Myanmar. You can tell them your itinerary and people to contact at home (if you turn up dead or kidnapped or whatever). Nowadays I would probably do that in Thailand and Cambodia too.

This sort of came up for me since I was writing a running blog about the travels and I wrote a bit about the adventure of crossing the barbed wire and US Marine guard to the US ""embassy"" in Yangon (which at the time had no ambassador, as a protest to the gov't but now it does again) and filling out the little form.

Well I couldn't get any internet access at all outside of Yangon so after about two and a half weeks my parents got worried (since I usually posted some long story like this every day or two). *They* contacted the US State Department and when I got back to Yangon after a pretty grueling time up north in Mandalay (just from lack of food due to holiday closed restaurants, diarrhea, and being splashed with water all the time during the water festival) I went back to the same little hostel in Yangon and they said the US Government has been looking for you!"

This idiom is generally used to show that one person an ruin it for the entire group.

&gt;If someone in a group is referred to as a bad apple, best be aware that this could be the downfall of the whole group. In other words, the negative influence of one in a group could prove to be the undoing of the entire group that would otherwise — without the negative influence — remain good.

The downfall of the group being that the entire infrastructure be removed.

Or an alternative source: [Link](http://voices.yahoo.com/popular-phrases-origin-meaning-one-bad-apple-2718025.html)

&gt;The phrase ""one bad apple can spoil the whole bunch"" as we use it today, means that one person doing wrong can affect a whole group of people. It can mean that the person doing wrong can have a negative influence on those around him or her, causing them to do wrong as well. It can also mean that one person doing wrong can cause others to be prohibited from doing something for fear that they will do wrong as well.

So to take either of those at their face value for the idioms represented (and the general use of this saying) is akin to saying all Police are bad police because of a few bad apples. (thus should have their powers reduced)

All Unions are bad because of a few (and as per the last example of the use of the idiom, should not exist to prevent the occasional misuse of the few bad apples)"

-No, it's about the same either way if you consider JUST stem prices.

Silk flowers will be more expensive in the end if you don't get them 1/2 off. $4.99 for a realistic rose? That's much more expensive than a regular rose at a florist($3ish,) or at a grocery store ($1.75 on average per stem). If you use the cheaper bunches at the craft store, it will be more cost effective definitely. But if you want it to look realistic, then it'll be about the same for real flowers.  (Craft stores have big sales often though!)

If they are half off, the price will probably be the same if you are doing it yourself either way. Remember florists charge for labor included in their prices.

-Yes, it's completely possible. And, I do think it is worth it because you can save a lot of money if you do it correctly. 100 people = 11 or 12 tables? Expect $20-25 per table roughly, I think. I could get out my receipts if you want, or do some calculations for you, if you would like! 

Do any of you have any experience? Are you going to use a florist for the wedding party? Are you going to use a florist for the bridal bouquet? Looking forward to your response to my questions-- I would gladly give you a ""shopping list"" of things you might want to consider faux flower arrangements, from the perspective of a florist and not a Pinterest tutorial!! :)"

On one hand, you have the people who don't want to reduce worlds. These people farm monsters for cash, they do bosses, they do lots of skilling, and don't really care about the social aspects so much. Runescape to them has never been about the community, or the other people playing. It's about the game. It's the skills, the fighting, the leveling up. They voted the way they do to keep the game how they want it, and to fit their play style. 

The players who WANT the world reduction, I feel, are less about the game and more about the community and the experience. They like talking to people, even if it means lower xp. They like to play minigames, to relax, and to be with other people. They don't really care about how this update will effect themselves. Rather, they feel like having fewer worlds will bring the community together. They want new players to experience the RuneScape community. To feel like they are a part of something greater. 

I think both play styles are great, and whatever makes somebody happy is great. Both options on this poll have really strong positives and really strong negatives. But these two types of people want different things, and there is no way to appease them both. "

arinot,AskWomen,1390891840.0,"... speaking as a person who was in that rut, many of these guys aren't after sex. 

Many are after the emotional self validation they think comes from a relationship. 
If they only wanted sex, then their actions would be more akin begging. Hell, it'd be easier for them to go searching for a prostitute if it was only about sex!

There *are* the guys who use ""friend zone"" to refer to girls that they didn't lay, but we aren't talking about *them*. 

We're talking about the ""nice guys"",  who are really just somewhat insecure + have a whole lot of conflicting information. 


I think a lot of this confusion is due to how different kinds of people use this term with different connotations


So I guess in short you're confusing the ""that girl I was so close to banging just compared me to being like a brother. The fuck?"" with ""I've praised her, helped her with all these things, bought her things.... Why doesn't she reciprocate my feelings when I'm really trying? I'm following what mom/dad/movies/sister/etc said is romantic... Why isn't it working? Must be me/something I'm doing wrong/etc...""

Former blames girl, latter is confused and often thinks there's something wrong with themselves.

SirJefferE,explainlikeimfive,1390891884.0,"Sex is natural. Sex feels good. Nearly every single person on the planet will feel some kind of sexual urge or another in their lifetime. It's normal and it's expected.

In the book [Predictably Irrational](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictably_Irrational), Dan Ariely writes about a study he and a colleague did. Here's a summary of that chapter from Wikipedia:
&gt;By using computers to stimulate sexual arousal, they determined that in a stimulated state, the young men were more likely to undergo an action that they would not normally consider. Using the data, Ariely argues that other high-emotion situations such as anger, frustration, and hunger have the potential to trigger similar effects on decision-making.

So to put it all together: Underage kids know that they shouldn't be having a lot of sex, and that they should be using protection, and that sex and emotions can get really complicated, and so on. And yet, under the right conditions, an older guy could *easily* trick any number of girls into thinking they want to have sex with him. There are games and emotional states you can fiddle around with that no kid is going to notice at the time simply because they are inexperienced.

After the fact they might get pregnant, or diseased, or just plain regret it. They might think they failed or maybe they were saving themselves for marriage or whatever it is. The point is kids can have sex without meaning to and regret it.

Because of this, we as a society agree that it is immoral for an older person to have sex with a younger one. Yes, there are legitimate cases of experimentation that *are* stopped because of this law. There are situations where no harm could possibly come and the law is probably restricted in those situations, but it is in place to prevent any kind of predatory behavior that *could* cause trouble.

I'd have to look up exact wording of exact laws, but in most cases I would say that it is illegal for the *older* person to have sex. I'm not sure the younger person is doing anything illegal by having sex with the older one. The laws are in place to protect the young person, not the old one. It doesn't make sense to try the kid as an adult for this, because we're not trying the kid for anything.

Anyways, I think I rambled, so it's time to move on to murder:

The quote I put in from that book up above definitely applies here. High emotion situations could easily cause somebody to do something they never think they could do. The difference here is that the high emotions have *ended somebodies life*. When you try a kid as an adult it's usually because the crime is exceptional. Really violent, gruesome, whatever. What is important to remember is that when the person under trial gets into a high emotion state he is *completely unstable*. The other difference is that the laws in place here are to protect potential victims, and not to protect the person on trial.

If the option didn't exist to try a youth as an adult, a youth could look at the penalties for murder, think, ""You know what, I'm turning 18 next month, I really hate Greg, and these penalties aren't bad. Think I'll do it."" With the current laws, he'd likely get tried as an adult.

I'm not sure I put everything together exactly how I hoped, especially in a ELI5 way, but it looked more like a ""Change my view"" kind of question so I answered it closer to what I would have typed there."

Then all the girls got together in a crowd to ask her questions, but she couldn't handle the pressure of her newfound reproductive fame and came in the next day telling us she thought it was her period but turned out her cat had just scratched her. So then we all gossiped about why in god's name she was naked with her cat in a way that the cat could draw blood from her vaginal area. At this time, a girl who really had experienced periods came forward (she was embarrassed before it became the hit new sensation) and she gave us details about what it really looks and feels and smells, how often you need to change your pad, how moms react, and why cramps are called CRAMPS because they actually can be very painful. So then she became the real hero of sex education, we got the facts from the teachers and the nitty gritty from the source, and eliminated a weirdo from our social group.

ohgeronimo,Buddhism,1390892396.0,"Ok, weird question. If someone can help, it's much appreciated. Also, maybe not technically a beginner question, and I apologize if it's too far from the spirit of this thread.

A few times in the past when waking up and discovering I had woken up before the time I'd prefer on the clock I have instead opted to meditate while still in bed. Just laying there, focusing on my breath, and when I look over it's just about the time I had intended to stop. When it's happened it's usually only been in short 15 minute sessions or so.

So the thing is, it seems far too short of time. At the time I can't remember being there for that long, but I also can't remember not being entirely focused on my breathing. If I'm falling asleep, I seem to be doing so quite seamlessly because I'd have to be focusing on my breath, falling asleep, waking up, focusing on my breath, looking over at the clock. To me, the entire experience feels continuous like I hadn't stopped being aware of my breath at any moment. But my sensation of time seems off. The experience seems short, as though I must have stopped being aware.

So my question is, is this something other people have experienced while meditating? Has your sensation of time while meditating seemed off? Shorter, longer? Or was I falling asleep? 

I'm leaning towards the sleep, because I just can't seem to get the same effect when I'm not freshly awoken, tired, and stressed about getting up after feeling as if I'd not gotten enough sleep. It's the reason I'd tried it, to calm down about being tired and have 15 minutes or so to just relax, but obviously that's also a ripe combination for someone to power nap for 15 more minutes.

Any anecdotes from similar experiences? Thank you for your time."

feedmahfish,askscience,1390892994.0,"The stomach is not full of water.

When it eats, most of the water passes through the gills.  The fish does swallow some water which goes into the stomach, but is mostly pushed back out.  Most of the time, you pull out the contents of the stomach, and it's just like any normal stomach: it's full of what the fish ate, and not much liquid other than the acids.  If the fish drank water, that's a bit of a different story.

But fish stop eating much like any other animal: it eats to a point where eventually the stomach gives off satiation signals to the brain, and it doesn't want to eat anymore.  I am currently tucked into bed right now and about to pass out, so I'll edit this up with a neurological explanation of the ""Eat, stop eating"", signal processing that occurs when I wake up today.

MenWhoStareAtG0ATSE,AskReddit,1390893445.0,"Cool, man. I apologize for my little tirade there. I was aware that this thread gained the attention of SRS and was quick to get on the defensive. I expected that if I didn't get an immediately civil response that I'd just end up arguing with someone unreasonable and aggressive just for being a white person discussing black people. 

I guess I'll start off by addressing the points of my argument that I knew to be weak, but included anyway. Yes, Pac is half of a bad example. He wrote some songs that were revolutionary in hip hop for their approach to sensitive social issues. BUT that was half of his image. The other half is the foundation on which a lot of bullshit was built. Obviously not everyone who draws influence from Tupac promotes violence and negativity, but there are lots of acts who got famous trying to be Thug Life Pac, and all they got from him was (yes, wrongly deduced, but that's their fault, not mine) ""if I talk like a fringe-of-society drug lord, people will pay attention to me.""

I don't know if I agree with you about TI. I was never a big fan of him, so my impressions of him are mostly what I've seen from his popular songs, but honestly that fits the conversation so I'll move forward with that. From what I saw, he really only turned a new leaf after he got convicted.  And I'm not totally convinced that a lot of that wasn't for PR purposes. I like Luda's music, but most of it (exception being Run Away -- am I getting that title right? Good song) that made its way into pop charts was based on objectifying women, the promotion of irresponsible consumerism, and over the top tough guy and/or thug stuff (What's Your Fantasy, Move Bitch, Welcome to Atlanta, etc.). 

To address your examples of positive mainstream rappers, Drake certainly fits the bill. If I had the will to be pedantic I could probably make an argument that his being from Canada makes him at least marginally less relevant to this conversation since the rest of it has been about black people in America, but since we're talking productively now I'll curb the argumentative crap and just agree that you've got a point there. I don't know that Kanye necessarily serves as a good example of this anymore. His first few albums were great examples of productive, positive and socially conscious hip hop, even if he did actively trivialize education. But it's hard to deny that he has sort of spiraled into something else. His music now is more about justifying his arrogance, and his public behavior is even worse. His famous award ceremony moment, his recent assault on some stupid racist white kid, his (multiple, if I'm not mistaken) assault(s) on paparazzi. I can't say I'd be any better in his position. I'm quick tempered and prideful too, but since the conversation is about the positive/negative influence of black pop culture figures as role models, I think there's a very strong argument to be made that he is a negative influence. 

I saved Jay-Z for last just to say this:

&gt;truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense/ but I did five mil, I ain't been rhyming like Common since

That's sort of the whole point I was trying to make. The thesis goes something like this: black rappers who want to make it in pop culture are encouraged to discard lyrical substance and artistic integrity and instead encourage escapism and irresponsible and/or downright destructive behavior. 

A solid point in your favor would be Common himself or Lupe Fiasco. They are the antithesis to all of this and have had, at the very least, not-insignificant success in pop culture. 

I understand the point you're making. I'm sort of a purist myself. And if we were comprehensively discussing the merits of hip hop as a genre, I'd be on your side. But we're discussing black pop culture icons as role models. I just think the ones who promote irresponsible behavior, irresponsible spending, illegal activity, lack of education, violence, pride in ignorance and generally fringe lifestyles severely outnumber those who don't. So is my point a disservice to hip hop? Sure, if I were talking about hip hop as a whole it would be a dickish and incorrect statement. But if we're talking about hip hop in pop culture, I think my statement is at least fair.

I'm going to bed now. Gotta be up in the morning. The latter part of this discussion was a real pleasure though. Take care man.


edit: I forgot to address your point about Outkast. I guess they do talk about gettting high/drunk and make some party music which *could* fit into what I generalized as 'irresponsible behavior'. I didn't put a lot of thought into that one before I typed it. But they have their share of positive music, even among their hit singles. I might have given them a pass because they are pretty much universally considered great hip hop artists."

If there is a stock amp in the trunk, you can look behind the speakers in the front as well as the tweeters and see the wiring colors. They will match up with the wires at the factory amp. After you wire in the crossover to the new amp, wiring the tweeter and woofer would just require you to match the wiring. You would use the stock wiring to run the new speakers.

&gt; What I expect

                Lloris

    Walker - Dawson - Vlad - Rose

          Bentaleb - Dembele

    Lennon - Eriksen - Chadli/Siggy

                 Ade

&gt; What I hope

                Lloris

    Walker - Vlad - Vertonghen - Rose

           Capoue - Dembele

       Lennon - Eriksen - Townsend

                 Ade

&gt; Subs (for what I expect)

* Paulinho on for Dembele

* Capoue on for Betaleb (out of necessity when we're struggling because we don't have a DM)

* Townsend on for Chadli/Siggy

* If not one of the above, Vertonghen on for Dawson or Vlad

&gt; Thoughts/notes

* We *NEED* to start with a DM. Bentaleb is great and I know Sherwood loves the kid, but City's midfield will run all over him. If we start with a 4-4-2 and Bentaleb... (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

* Townsend should be match fit, but Sherwood might not want to throw him back into the starting lineup against City.

* All indications are that Vertonghen and Paulinho are ready, but same reasoning for Townsend stands: Sherwood might not want to risk it in a big match like this.

* I'm conflicted, I want Defoe to get some playing time, but I also want our returners to get some good runouts for at least part of the game. Not sure who should get priority.

* If pansy-Chadli shows up again I'm going to shit a brick. Siggy might be easier to push off the ball but at least he'll give an honest effort. Townsend would be ideal, as he's guaranteed to run head on against a not-as-fast Zabeleta."

Alaira314,WTF,1390893652.0,"I think the biggest issue with doctors, especially those practicing non-emergency medicine, is that they don't have any incentive to say ""I don't know.""  Patients want immediate answers, not an uncertain ""I'll research your symptoms"" answer, which tends to result in doctors jumping on the statistically most probable cause for a set of symptoms, rather that taking all options into consideration.

I know somebody who had a really bad experience with doctors over the past 6~ months.  He has high blood pressure, and a particular medication that his old doctor had him on lowered his blood pressure, despite the fact that it raised blood pressure in most of the population.  I don't know the exact reason why this happened, I'm not a doctor, but it was a noticeable effect.  When the ACA came into effect, he had to switch doctors(to one that was supported by his new plan) and she refused to prescribe him the medication.  Blood pressure ended up through the roof.  Last I heard, a new doctor started at that practice, and he's been seeing him, and he's on the medication that works again.

Doctors aren't perfect, but I tend to trust them unless given a reason not to.  I don't think that 5 minutes of googling is equivalent to 5+ years of medical school, but I think it's important to recognize that many doctors do become complacent, and tend to diagnose the easiest option without looking past the obvious.  Not everybody who pushes for a second opinion is an idiot who spends too much time on webmd."

As far as gender issues go (being tangentially related to these subs), there isn't much actual policy I think needs addressing (other than gay marriage of course, but that's coming along nicely). Perhaps an investigation of bias against fathers in family courts is in order, and maybe the language of the VAWA could be revised to include male victims, and a big one is a complete revision of the rape policies in the military.

Edit: I forgot, US prison policy needs to be addressed in dramatic ways, and this can kind of be considered a gendered issue due to the gender segregation of prisons."

However, you probably want him to know everything about you, not have to lie to him or walk around the truth if he asks, and you want to be honest with him and have that peace of mind. And of course it's not like it's a horrible past... it's stripping! Nothing evil about it.

Now, some guys are extremely conservative about these things... but you probably don't want to be with a boring conservative guy, and the sooner you know he isn't one the better. Your boyfriend doesn't look like he'll want to burn you at the stake for being impious and improper and hating baby Jesus though; if he joked about it he may be a perfectly cool guy with it. So tell him next time the topic is on stripping, your past or whatever; chances are that he'll be cool and if he's uncool, good riddance.

The one thing I tell people most often when listing designs is that length does not in any way determine what kind of bow it is.

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390895313.0,"I don't know which among these is the worst. They have all affected me. 

-Being followed by two guys asking how many cocks I'd be sucking tonight. I've been catcalled many times and that's bothersome, too, but this shook me up because they were actually trying to make me fear for my safety. 

-Being touched and treated like a toy by guys at work. 

-Being forced to smile and act flattered while my boss recited me love poetry  (and just generally was a creep)

-Being cornered and pressured to give my number to a guy who would not take no for an answer and seemed like he might get violent

-Being followed for blocks by guys (on a few different occasions) who were trying to get me into some sort of shady ""business arrangement"" (like being a stripper)

-At a job interview, being told several times how cute I was and not being asked anything except how popular I was with guys. 

-Being told by multiple men I've looked up to that a woman's role is to be a wife. Often it was just made as a casual remark, with the assumption that this is a normal view. It was nothing personal against me, but it's sad to be young and naive and realize the people you look up to ultimately expect little of you. 

-Being told by my parents that I couldn't take martial arts classes because it was too manly and being told I couldn't do cheerleading because it was too sissy. I suspect my parents just couldn't afford it and wanted to shelter me from the truth, figuring subtle sexism was easier for me to handle. 

-Being put in a lower math class than I deserved to be in without any regard for my test scores or grades. I later found out that my guidance counselor (a woman) frequently just placed girls in low math classes arbitrarily. It didn't help that all my life my mom projected her fears of math onto me as well. I always loved math and felt good at it and then as I got older I realized my parents had never believed in me, at least not in that respect. 

-Being brushed off when you say something because ""you don't know anything about this"", being laughed at for your dreams. It's worse than just being told you can't do it. 

It's really hard to articulate sexism through these kinds of incidents, though. I feel the burden of sexism more patterns of people's behavior and societal expectations. You don't need to have a traumatic experience to inherit the fear from other people's traumatic experiences. Ultimately, it's the fear that controls you. 

For instance, I grew up partially in Tokyo, and basically every woman I knew had been groped on the train at some point. So every day, it was at the front of my mind. In trains, I would be paranoid of everyone and play the tape over and over in my mind of how I would sock the guy in the face. I just was tense all the time. I dressed down so as not to ""attract"" gropers. It's also common there for guys to take pictures up girls' skirts, so I never wore skirts. I was lucky to have that option, but most schools make girls wear skirts as part of the uniform. 

It is a rare day that I am not fearing in some way for my safety. I'm actually quite athletic and trained in karate, but it doesn't comfort me that much to know that, because I'm small and look girly -- I look like an easy target. I've been mugged and actually put up a fight (which is not advised) but ultimately it's not about whether they succeed in mugging you or raping you; just being attacked in any form is deeply unsettling.  When I am walking home, or on the train, or out jogging, or anywhere, really, I am always calculating the risk. When interacting with guys, it's the same thing. There is always the possibility that he will spike my drink, that he will stalk me, turn violent, etc. 

The thing that is crippling is how so much of the burden falls on women's shoulders to ""prevent"" being attacked or avoid ""inviting it"". People will say it isn't your fault, but then they ask what you were wearing, how were you acting, were you alone, etc. The implication is that you're the one who failed. If I have a daughter, I do want her to watch out for herself and use good judgement, of course. But it pains me to think of how that translates into her having to live her life on the defensive, making multiple decisions a day based on fear.

Every day, you have to offset stereotypes. With professors or employers I feel like I need to offset my femininity so they don't assume I'm dumb. In other situations, like working in customer service, I need to be pretty to be respected. I have to smile but I can't smile too much or men will think I'm flirting with them. I grew up with my dad making constant remarks about women on tv: how they were too ugly or too pretty (read: stupid whores). 

It's just this constant obligation to negotiate how you are perceived.  You have dress this way to please one crowd and that way to please another. Too much makeup, too little makeup. Speak up, shut up. Don't be too nice, don't be a biotch. Don't talk too high pitched, don't talk too low. And on and on. 

I'm not one to complain about how bad women have it. I think sexism works both ways. I'm just outspoken about this because as I've gotten older, I have started to understand how much sexism has affect me in subtle ways. Not in major ways, but in little ways all through my life, just enough to ingrain it in me. The subtle forms of sexism actually seem worse to me than the overt ones. The overt ones are somewhat easier to get over. The subtle ones slip under your radar and control you without you even understanding the monster you are dealing with.

I'm sorry this post is so freaking long. I hope that somebody out there in Redditland cares. "

I'd recommend looking for a more well rounded routine.  I know that's not what you asked for, but there are some muscles that you'd be neglecting if you stuck to those.  If you were going to stick to just 3 lifts, it should be squat, deadlift, and bench.  But I would only suggest that as the absolute bare minimum.  And make sure you aren't afraid of lifting heavy!

It's okay to ask people to some extent, although I'd only ask someone that you were already friendly with, and also, only really if they knew what they were doing.  Asking for a form check isn't usually a big deal, but asking someone how to perform a lift is pushing it.

JordanLeDoux,philosophy,1390895589.0,"&gt;We want each person to have a monopoly of force

*whoosh*

EDIT:

I guess I'll add this.

That whole long mess you just posted is a bunch of handwaving. Here's the reality of force: there will never be ""individual monopolies"" for any extended period of time, because in a free market system, force would be more valuable than every other good.

One group will always monopolize force because market forces ensure that as long as there is more than one group with force, it is more valuable for that group to continue to attempt to monopolize force instead of focusing on any other good. It's more valuable.

Or did you think all those wars we've had were accidents?"

Having worked for a charity in the past, I see how much wastage and how much ""it's not our money"" seems to permeate their decision process.

stuffandwhatnot,dragonage,1390896050.0,"Yes, it will get easier. One thing that will help is getting to know your party tactics. You can set up automatic actions for them to do, along with preferred behavior--i.e., if you want them ranged or up close or sticking on you all the time, etc. 

Another thing: the game is really designed for you to pause-n-play. So you see a group of enemies coming up, you hit the pause button (or pull the trigger if you're on a console) and (for instance) tell Leliana to Pinning Shot one guy, Alistair to draw aggro from the two little guys, and Morrigan to cone of cold the big guy. And so forth. 

As a rogue, you will also want to use the 'hold party' feature often, as in when you might want to stealth ahead and scout the situation, get a good backstab in, or set a trap, etc. Hold party tells your companions to stay where they are, so they don't end up charging into battle and ruining your stealthy moves. 

You will want a mage that heals. You can spec Morrigan to heal, but she's not nearly as good at it as the mage you can recruit in the mage's tower. This is why I always hit the tower right after Lothering. Get her, spec her to healer, win. Morrigan is good for damage dealing and crowd controlling. Cone of Cold is your friend at lower levels (and is still effective at high levels, too). 

Rogues will want to get the top two talent groups up to Coup de Grace and Lethality quickly. For dual-wield, you will want to learn the Assassin specialty asap (you can learn it from a rogue companion you can recruit as soon as you've done one of the main quest lines--mage's tower, Redcliffe, Orzammar, etc.). The Stealth group is good too, for those sweet backstabs. I pretty much never take talents in the deft hands group, since lock picking is based on cunning, and as a rogue you should be investing highly  in cunning and dex anyway. 

If it's too hard and is genuinely interfering with your enjoyment, by all means turn the difficulty down. No need to tear your hair out.

Metro staff said there are several issues with those options, including a cost of **$3 billion** or more, a complex tangle of utilities under the terminals and runway areas and concerns from LAX about tunneling under critical facilities.

For reference he was about as thick and long as my thumb. He simply knew what he was doing- and technical skills are not just orgasms. He waited for PIV until i had had a few orgasms, so i was tight and swollen down there. I felt everything. He had a technique that worked for him and he was willing to be very kinky and intimate- he was so mentally present and giving. Passionate kisses, lots of variety in positions, and good knowledge of women's bodies.  

For the pencil dick guy, he just had this trick with anal where he would either finger or DP with a toy up front. He was longer than the first guy, but not by much. We changed positions a lot, did some light kinky stuff. Again, he just knew what he was working with and what tools he had at his disposal, and had sex that way.  We were just able to have this messy, intimate, generous sex where both of us were fully in the moment. There was no holding back, no selfishness, we both gave and took from each other. 

Finally, good sex is present, generous lovers who knew how to be in the moment, not dong size or number of orgasms.  My ex husband was hung like a horse. He was also a premature ejaculating macho starfish and i had shitty lame sex for ten years despite his big wang. I don't understand why a lot of guys do not realize that for some women it really is as simple as just being good in bed. Not everyone is a size queen. Yes, some are, but not everyone. So just like some people aren't into fat chicks, some people are not into little penises. But it doesn't mean there aren't people for whom weight or penis size is not a dealbreaker. 

That said, I really think your ""were you/could you be honestly happy"" question is pretty invalidating. I don't know how much more happy I could be if In the original post i said these two dudes were among the best fucks of my life and that i would fuck them again and still fantasize. I also mentioned in the original post that both of them were able to penetrate me, so I am not sure where you got the ""intimate feelings"" thing. Finally, sex isn't just orgasms.

She might had a really different and controversial raising than you. I've been in a *kind of similar* situation where your girl is, though not in the same situation you two are. I've looked at porn, but not been ok with it, or even okay with myself doing it. (didn't have a great childhood, problems with my mom, etc, long story short bla bla).

It would be really great if you could listen to her, and suggest she would first look in to it on her own, find something she could enjoy by herself, plain masturbation, or also porn/literotica/toys etc. Look them up with her. Help her find something. Ask what she likes to fantasise about when she is turned on, and when you're having your fun time. 

She needs a push, it's perfectly normal NOT to have had any contact with porn, not everyone needs that, not porn nor masturbation. Look at toys with her, maybe help her order a small vibrator. 

Trust me, I'm speaking from experience. My SO helped me out with my issues with masturbation and porn. Though I done them before, I wasn't ok with it. It bothered me, and I had an unhealthy attitude and relationship with it. 

The biggest and most important thing is that you support her! 
You really want her to be okay and comfortable with it first (with herself) before you show her your porn. As you said, she would judge you.

This is her issues, but you can be the best thing to her, as helping and supporting her all the way, because that can turn in to the best thing that happens to your relationship. It's great that you noticed things like this right at the start, before they turn into bigger issues and fights etc. 

Good luck man!

I realized that, besides not being ready to date and love again, the reason I had been single for so long was that I had kinda let myself go. Not much, but I was not the confident-20-something-dude this girl of my dream felt in love with several years ago anymore. I had lost my sparks. Since then, I started to do more stuff, to be more interesting, more in shape. I went out more with friends, I stopped complaining my friends were moving forward with their lives and started to move forward with mine. Sure, I won't get married or have kids anytime soon as they are, but I'm. Not. Dead. I still haven't found anyone I like remotely as much as that first one, but I'm out there.

30 minutes, however, is pretty long. Have you timed it? Is it really 30 minutes? If so, it's fair for her to want you to try and work on that number. Are you masturbating often? Are you using condoms? Can you stop doing either of those two things, if you are?

2. As Mr Rogers said: “When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.""

3. Surround yourself with balanced people who love life. Friends need friends, not therapists. Help your friends who are struggling, but reserve that energy for the friends who are truly good to you and good *for* you. 

4. Relish the beauty in sadness. See how it makes people kinder. See how it makes life fuller. Without knowing sadness, we can't know happiness, nor can we know what it means to show love. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HbYScltf1c

5. Find something you can do to shed the stress when you're starting to feel weighed down, like jogging, dancing, meditating, playing music, etc. 

6. Focus on things you can control.

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1390897525.0,"If it has to be in the context of trp/tbp...

I only recently put effort into understanding the manosphere and trying to sympathize/emulate so most of my thoughts on this particular subject (gov't policies towards my ideals) would be relatively unaffected. 

I know a popular and core issue is Child Custody, but I honestly haven't looked too much into that. I haven't read and compared the numbers of fathers who pursued custody and compared with other factors. Haven't thought enough about the ethics (for the father, child, mother), haven't considered how primary caregiver status, parent-child bond affect this. This is one of the primary concerns of MRM and I only have emotional connection, which I can't say is enough. 

Issues that I found easy to relate to in MRMs have a lot to do with male disposability (vagrancy, work related deaths, domestic violence, military service, prison, etc), shaming/pressure, mental health, and some other smaller issues. This sympathy isn't just limited to my experiences in the US. I actually find it even worse in other countries in the world I've been to. So I do think there's something to be said about a common theme around the world with brushing underclass male issues under the rug.

There's a lot more, and I would mainly just want public awareness of these issues. Supposedly, in a democratic society, with the proper awareness, people can vote on their own policies to address those issues. I know feminism is supposed to address these issues. Supposed to, but I've found it doesn't have the time or power to, which is why I'm supportive of the MRM after putting sincere effort into empathizing and even emulating their feelings and expressions to the best of my ability. 

I don't care that many people, even people I respect, have issues with it. Many people had issues with the feminist movement when it started as well, and they had worse radicals from what I've read.

If we're talking about our general political ideology without consideration for this trp/tbp context, then I don't have a consistent favoured one, because I can't think of one that is commonly understood and well-defined/named that is perfectly consistent with my personal ethical standards. My ethics are impractical when applied to any large scale. Thus, policies would have to be context specific, depending on factors such as population, natural resources, foreign relations, economics, ethicities, culture/language, religions, etc."

FlyingPanties69,relationships,1390897657.0,"This might be a bit long, but only because how your gf feels/reacts about these sorts of things is very similar to my gf: she's afraid that she looks ""funny"" while orgasming, and doesn't see how beautiful she is (due to past relationships, but that's another story). etc. Just saying this as a premise that so you know that I can relate. 

Now, I see this as a 3 part problem. Not a relationship-ending one, but one that definitely needs to be nipped in the bud. 

1. Let's start with the stupid comment, something I once again can relate to very much. They happen, you're mouth moves faster than your brain sometimes, etc. Right now the comment should't be your primary concern, but later, after things have calmed down, talk to her. Tell her that you sometimes say things that are dumb. You don't mean for them to come off the way they do, but sometimes what you say is meant as harmless, a joke, or just an observation. You don't mean to hurt her, and honestly from your post you know how comments like that can really take a toll on her self-esteem. **Let her know that you know that your comment(s) can be hurtful, but that that you never meant to come off that way.** This is important and very different than just saying sorry: your intent in this situation means just as much as the action itself. Make sure to tell her that your intent, your mindset, wasn't thinking of how your words may have come off. You do care about her, and that's why the next step is important: do actually take an extra half-second before talking to be **sure** that it can't be taken the wrong way. Trust me, it helps, and over time it'll become habitual. 

2. The issue of porn: it's a means to an end, yes, but that won't be how she sees it. Given that it seems she was more worried about the comment, I'd be concerned about that and give it priority that you don't see her that way, etc and so forth. The porn is most hurtful **in conjunction** with the comment because it reinforces what the comment already opened up: issues with self-esteem. She'll think that you're going to porn because she's not satisfying a need, that the women in porn are more attractive, etc. All of that is hurtful, even though you and I know it is a means to an end, that there's no attraction in mind. As with the first portion, it's important to reiterate this, and that, even though she won't necessarily see it that way, she at least knows that that is how you view porn: it is a tool, nothing more. As far as you watching porn in the first place, that is between you and your gf, but ask what she thinks, because her opinion should be important to you. Of course she is going to feel self-conscious/insecure about porn, but not because of it on its own: it exacerbates her already existing low self-esteem. What you said is what you should make it a point to make clear: that you are very much attracted to her and that nothing you'll ever seen on a screen will change that. She will find that hard to believe because of her view of herself (hopefully not, but we're going for all scenarios here) but the important thing is that you make your attraction to her, and your feelings of guilt (which from your post seem genuine) very clear. 

3. She may not have been joking about moving to an open relationship, but that doesn't necessarily mean that's what she wants. As she said, she would only do it to make you happy, to keep you around. As points 1 &amp; 2 reveal, she may very well be feeling like she is not enough for you, that she doesn't satisfy you. Assuming it won't lead to more problems, ask her if that's why: she wants you happy and wouldn't want to lose you over sex. Now, your fear is that she wants to sleep with someone else, but the way she phrased it, and went about bringing it up (assuming your post is accurate) leads me to believe that I'm right in my assessment that she would only want that to make sure you were happy/keep her around. She doesn't want that, obviously. She didn't like you watching porn, she definitely doesn't like the idea of you sleeping with other people, but is willing to bring it up as an option because it sounds like she is just as afraid of losing you as you are of her. You already said that that's not something you want, and I would make that clear to her. 

Now, where to go from here? 

The most important, vitally important, thing to make crystal clear is that you are very much attracted to her and that you aren't interested in having sex with other people. That you're happy in your relationship and, most of all, are afraid of losing her over this, because you know you've hurt how she feels about herself by your actions. Make the points about dumb comments (all guys make them) and about porn. Ask her her genuine opinion about porn (assuming you haven't had this conversation already) and take it from there. 

Long term: low self-esteem is something that will come up again, so in that regard its important that you let her know here and there that your feelings for her, and your attraction to her, are genuine. If you don't already, little things will help with this. It doesn't have to be much: a post-it note hidden in her drawer saying hi and how beautiful you think she is, making her lunch for school/work etc, or just little things along those lines. The low self-esteem will always be there, but the more you remind her how you truly feel the better. 

You were right in one regard: this will get better with time so long as the wound in her self-image is allowed to heal, and something that can and will help that is showing her all the feelings you showed in this post: regret, dismay, fear, and so on. You care about her, and never in your life would imagine hurting her. So long as you keep all of this in mind, and move forward honestly telling her, reassuring her, that she isn't losing you and that you aren't interested in other people, things will get better. 

Best of luck, and sorry for the long-ass post. "

icepyrox,AskMen,1390898265.0,"Late to the party, thought I'd chime.

My guess is the 20 minutes was ""is he gone yet? What do I do?""

I don't think she really knows how to deal with non-exclusive relationships. Your wording suggests that you didn't understand the part of seeing other people either. It's all fun and games until two contestants meet.

She probably sat in the bathroom wishing Bob would leave and then as a last resort sent you the text. Leaving is absolutely the correct response. She was probably hoping you would go outside and wait for her, but 20 minutes have ruined any fun for the night.

Whether you see her again or not is up to you. She panicked so the date was over. You said you weren't exclusive, so you have no right to be mad that you got to meet one of the other guys. Or that she likes them as well. I mean, isn't the definition of a non-exclusive relationship the fact you are not the only one? Or was that BS so you wouldn't feel guilty flirting with other girls when she wasn't around?

If you can talk out what happened and set up boundaries or policies of what to do next time not to ruin the night, then no big deal. Live, learn, move on.

If she is going to panic every time you meet another guy, and what is she going to do if she meets another of your girls, then forget it. Neither of you understand what it means to see other people at the same time.

Or become exclusive so that you don't have to worry about other guys."

&gt;Does your boyfriend **have to** know?

In the strictest sense of the words, No, he doesn't. But he should.

&gt;Is it like i'm being dishonest with him by not telling him?

Yes and No. If it never comes up, and neither of you ever mention it, that's not really being dishonest; especially given that it's a private matter. That being said, were it ever brought up... it would be extremely dishonest (actually, dishonest to the point of lying by omission imho) to deflect from admitting it, or downright denying it.

Were I in your boyfriends shoes I would like to know, I would also likes to know your reasons for doing it, stopping, and keeping it a secret.

I don't think i'd be able to hold it against you, i'm just not that sort of person.

But I would hold lying against you, lying by omission or explicitly lying are both major breaches of trust in my book.

I'm not kidding. Even now. Especially now that the Space Shuttle is over.

justgivingsomeadvice,TrueAnime,1390898550.0,"&gt; It didn't take me three episodes of Honey and Clover to know that show is never something I'd ever enjoy. I go through those season preview images and just write shows off in the blink of an eye

Well the real reason is to establish **why** something is putting you off. I honestly only watched H&amp;C on the grounds that it was apparently a rather mature take on life appropriate for college students. I didn't really appreciate the slapstick much (it grew on me) and God did I hate the design of Hagu (the protagonist who looks like she's 12 or something).

Strictly speaking from an enjoyment point of view, the first couple episodes didn't do much for me. That said, I hear the characterization is excellent and mature, and the humor and character design, while off-putting, do not contradict what I like out of the show. So in that regard, it'd be pretty fucking stupid to write off a show without letting it get its footing. And that's really the thing. Dropping a show after a couple of minutes is stupid if you're trying to evaluate the characterization, plot, thematic discussion, etc. It's just not enough time. And I'm going to guess many of us enjoy media that look at things a little more carefully. That said, you can easily judge the feel, atmosphere of the first few minutes of a show and make predictions of how a show will fare in whatever categories are important to you.

And that's really the crux of it. We should be using whatever information we have to evaluate if a show is worth watching: the feel/atmosphere/tone of the first episodes, our enjoyment on a visceral level, the opinions of other people, the setting, the artstyle, you name it. Golden Time had a pretty long leash due to its connection with Toradora! (dropped after 6 episodes, normally would have lasted about 1) because I guessed that the show could provide a lot of value (in terms of enjoyment, not artistic expression) due to its connection with Toradora! In contrast, I dropped Lovely Complex after like 6 minutes, because I didn't like the atmosphere of it at all. But it's good to remember the limitations of these prejudgments. Maybe there's a tone change, maybe the strong parts that I liked (in the case of a good romance and characterization) didn't get a chance to show themselves. And I'd be second-guessing my decision to drop Lovely Complex (instead of putting it on hold or something) if I had the time to be watching more than 3-4 episodes a week.

While not a concrete rule, the three-episode is handy as a rule of thumb and I don't necessarily think it's a good idea to cast off shows ten minutes in if there's still a high probability of you enjoying the show. So if we had the same exact anime tastes (we probably don't) and I told you H&amp;C is excellent, then it'd be a little stupid to drop it after ten minutes, since you have new information that suggests the likelihood of you enjoying it is higher than otherwise. 

Sorry, that was a bit long-winded."

IWasUpAllNight,Dirtbikes,1390898821.0,"I grew up in vegas and live in Northern Nevada now.  The short answer is Yes, but not a ""dirt bike.""  Bikes commonly labeled Dual Sport or Enduro are street legal (make sure their street legal!) dirt oriented bike.  Look at things like the DR650, XR650, DRz400, Wr250, etc.  Make sure the bike has a license plate!

I commute 60 miles on the freeway to work on a DR650 and take it trail riding every weekend.  My sister in Vegas *doesnt own a car.*  just a sport bike.  Its definitely do-able, but there are some problems.  Grocery shopping via motorbike is a bitch, and you can never really get much.  You cant load all your friends in the car and go to the lake.

I use my Dual Sport as my main transportation, though.  Its very possible.  Used dual sports in the 650 class (DR650, XR650, KLR650) can be found in your price range pretty easily.  These bikes are heavy, though, and can be a real bitch out in the sand.  The smaller displacement, newer dual sports are still capable of freeway speeds, and much better off road, but tend to be more expensive.  Smaller displacement older bikes will not be freeway friendly and limit you to surface streets.

**TL;DR: its definately possible, but with a few shortcomings.  I do it, and so does my sister.**

Feel free to ask any me questions, via PM or in a reply here.  I'd be happy to go over the ups and downs in more detail, and help you choose a bike if you decide to get one!

EDIT: I just saw the bit about racing.  No dual sport bike is suitable for motocross or tough enduros.  That being said, i've entered my DR650 in a local desert race.  Neither the bike nor I were very competative, but damn was it fun!"

ox_,Boxing,1390898846.0,"1. I think that although it was an early stoppage, Carl Froch was about to KO George Groves. Groves had thrown all his effort at Froch in the first few rounds and was completely spent. Froch was stronger than ever and landing massive shots. I think Froch will win the rematch by late KO.

2. Blatant drug cheats like Lamont Peterson and JMM can fuck off right out of the sport. I have no interest in seeing them fight.

3. I don't like watching Guillermo Rigondeaux fight. I can admit that he's an incredible boxer and in the top 5 P4P but I really don't enjoy watching him back off for 12 rounds.

The US Air Force launches a lot of rockets from [Vandenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandenberg_Air_Force_Base) in California, but it's not quite as ideal.

Probably just farther inland in Florida.

Ideal launching sites for Earth orbit (which is nearly all launch scenarios except for polar orbit) are near the equator so they take maximum advantage of the speed of the Earth's eastward rotation. And with a clear trajectory over water so if something goes wrong they can be blown up by the range control officer and nobody gets hurt by the debris.

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1390899448.0,"&gt; However, I don't mind taking part in calling TRP virgin neckbeards on TBP. The thing is, while being a virgin is not in and of itself bad, being a virgin and trying to speak from a position of expertise about sex on the internet is something else. ""Neckbeard"" is an insult for a certain personality type, a pretentious entitled slob.

I understand the hypocrisy angle, but I'm far more inclined to believe that it's simply ""lazy thinking as far as insults go"" as posited in another comment, as well as lack of empathy.

Especially when we look at how commonly it's used throughout the rest of reddit and in other forums and especially offline IRL. Using it as a criticism of *""hypocritical virgins who try to speak from a position of expertise""*, as you claim to have, is a rare usage. 

I even provided a recent example, in which I was talking about ""neoreactionaries"" (in that thread by i_trip_over_hurdles), who have more to do with anti-democracy, and the articles presented on them had more to do with their racism. Sexual strategy was never mentioned. ""Virgin neckbeard"" was just a convenient insult, and that is usually the case from what I've witnessed.

It's not simply a matter of shaming virgins directly just for being virgins. It's a matter of using the label ""virgin"" as a perjorative.

I'd question what the one making the insult has against virgins regardless of whom the target is.

Something you might empathize with more: It's like if a man were insulted with, ""You think like a woman!"" or ""Quit being so gay!""

Yes, the insults are directed at the man. He might even deserve a lot of criticism. 

The thing is, the insult are also indirectly implying that it's wrong to be a woman or wrong to be gay.

""Virgin"" applied as an insult is an indirect insult to people who are virgins. Used as a perjorative even against hated people/groups, it still implies that it's wrong to be a virgin. It takes focus away from your target's ""hypocrisy"" (which is an action and involves *choice*), and puts emphasis on a *state of being* that many people have no choice over."

CaspianX2,politicalfactchecking,1390899952.0,"In response to him being a ""sugar daddy"", apparently both Wendy Davis *and* Jeff Davis [take issue with that](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/22/ex-husband-wendy-davis-would-be-a-very-capable-governor/):

&gt;""Certain comments seem to always be taken out of context and the firestorm of Facebook/hashtag stuff is not useful for forming opinions"", [Jeff Davis] wrote.

&gt;[...]

&gt;it wasn't the first time Jeff Davis has been brought up in a report about Davis' life. She talked to Vogue about her ex-husband last year, saying she still considers him one of her ""role models."" She also brought up the fact that he used his 401(k) to pay the tuition at Harvard.

&gt;[...]

&gt;Though she has acknowledged Jeff Davis to the media in the past, she takes issue with the idea that he solely supported her.

&gt;""I was a vibrant part of contributing to our family finances from the time I graduated to the time we separated in 2003,"" she told the Dallas Morning News.

Whether or not she ""used him"" is really a matter of opinion, but since both she *and* him are saying that's not the case, I'd fall on the side of ""probably not"".

As for the second claim, it starts off on shady ground. It begins by framing an earlier lawsuit where she accused a newspaper of libel as ""claiming she has mental health issues"", clearly intending to make it look like she was saying she had been driven insane as opposed to, say, having increased stress.

Then it goes on to jump to the conclusion that because a bunch of ""don't do this"" type stuff was in a restraining order, she must have, therefore, done that stuff. Which anyone with any legal knowledge knows is bull - those things are generally standard forms intended to cover a wide range of possible activities.

What's more the ""restraining order"" in question likely was an [ATRO](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2012/07/11/divorcing-women-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-atros/), an automatic part of the divorce process, one Wendy Davis claims was amicable and one where she claims that she and her husband *agreed* that he would have custody of her child.

**tl;dr** - These attacks are twisting the words of two legal documents for partisan ends. The first document is her suing for libel and saying ""the crap they're saying is hurting my feelings"", and the second is a standard part of the divorce process saying ""here's a bunch of shit you shouldn't do after you divorce"". But the pundits are claiming that the first document is her declaring ""I'm crazy!"" and the second document is the court telling her to stop sleeping around and doing drugs.

If I don't see some damn good arguments that refute these facts, I'm marking this as **False**."

Now may I address the militarily strong, economically rich and politically enlightened countries and the idealist redditors that are citizens of those countries, foreign intervention is never the right choice, the loosing camp will always have a feeling that the winner cheated, and what you are ultimately doing despite having the best of intentions is kicking the political ball down the road.

""You are good enough, you just forget it sometimes"" is a good foundation to base yourself on.

I didn't come to this realization on my own and that brings me to a second, important point. You said;

&gt; What's wrong with me is I don't have any confidence in myself, and I've never really had any support from others, but it's not like that's really needed, I could just be whining here..

You're not just whining. When it comes to self confidence, support from other is not just needed - it's essential. I wouldn't be half the man I am today without my close group of friends who just fucking wouldn't give up on me. Even in my darkest moments of self-doubt and what I can only describe as emotional masochism, they propped me up and told me that I'm great and I'm silly for not believing that.

No man can do great things alone. I'm not sure what your situation with your friends are but if you want change, that might be a good place to start. It's not undignified to ask for help.

I understand you are shocked, you have to be. But please listen to him, support him, and TRY to understand.

StellarNeonJellyfish,AskReddit,1390900656.0,"In terms of the video games? Chief wakes up 4 years later on the forerunner planet from the legendary ending of Halo 3. Cortana is a year past her expiration date, which means she is going rampant and basically thinking herself to death. She awakens chief because they are being scanned and there are a metric fuck ton of covenant around them and the planet. 

They all get sucked into the planet (Forerunner slip-space physics going on in there, condensed space and what have you) because presumably the scanner picked up on chief and opened the planet. The Infinity is on its way to rescue Master Chief but there is static so Cortana and chief go to the source of the interference. This ends up being the suspension chamber/tomb of a disgraced forerunner who fought in the forerunner/human war (also the forerunner/flood war) named the Didact.

The Didact doesn't like humans cause he still hasn't gotten over the war and wants to reclaim the mantel (protect all life, yada yada) for the forerunners since it's obvious to him that the Humans are lacking.

He jumps to a Halo ring where an artifact called the composer is being excavated by Humans.As it turns out the composer is what turned some ancient humans into the Prometheans. Chief had already talked to the Librarian (Didact's wife, a life-worker who was charged with cataloging all life in the galaxy and storing it on the Ark, which was where the final level of Halo 3 took place) Chief flies in with the rampant Cortana and a nuke, looking to finish the Didact and save humanity as per usual.

The Chief is too late and everyone on the research station at instillation 3 is killed but him (thanks to the librarian). He hops in a longsword, joins the infinity at earth and boards the Didact's ship. Cortana brings down the shield by copying herself into the system and overloads it. The holo-deck with her chip is destroyed.

Chief finds the Didact, currently blasting away people down on Earth's surface. He detonates the nuke, and survives like a boss when Cortana's dying act is to form a solid-light barrier around him. The last shot is Chief removing his armor with the Librarian's augmentations making him significantly larger than previously."
justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1390900667.0,"Sure. But then, isn't it also the best interest of the league to create the parity that small-market owners (i.e. the future owners of the Hornets) want? By, you know, denying an equally acceptable (if not better) trade that would continue a big market franchise's dominance over the league only months after a new small market-friendly CBA was signed? (I know the Clips are big market too but you know what I mean.)

There's all sorts of conflicts of interest here, which is what bothers Laker fans. In contrast, the NO GM has only one goal: to make the Hornets better. So it's tough to argue that Stern had a greater interest in getting NO the best haul possible than the man whose job literally requires him to get the best players for his team. Which is why overruling the GM doesn't really make sense on that front, either."

The maths for working out even a simple four bar mechanism by hand is usually a multi-page effort - steam trains have hundreds of the things, and the outcome of one of those calculations affects the input of the following mechanism. There's fluid mechanics, thermo dynamics, mechanics of structures, kinematics, dynamics... Nothing in the design of a steam engine happened by happy mistake, it was all painfully derived and proven by hand before the first piece of steel was shaped.

Remember that the internal combustion engine was already a highly honed and developed piece of machinery long before the introduction of the computer.

It always result in infighting (girls vs boys in the never-ending 'generalization of sexes'-soap opera), and doesn't really accomplish anything but to increase our bad feelings towards others, and lessen our perceived self-worth.

Berean_Katz,MechanicAdvice,1390901270.0,"&gt;When you are done with a tool, put it away.

This is probably the **worst** thing about my previous shop! People would never put the tools away, or they would give out our tools to people without making sure we'd get them back. By the end of our Navy deployment, we'd have half as many tools! This is especially true--for some reason--with sockets.

&gt;OP are you a Seabee?

I'm an Engineman who previously worked on an LSD (Landing Ship Dock) Amphibious ship. If you don't already know, it's basically a taxi for marines and their amphibious vehicles (i.e., AAV's--which are essentially submersible tanks), as well as anything else they decide to bring on board. We have a well deck which is artificially flooded/deflooded so that we can park small craft inside the ship (i.e., LCAC's, LCU's, and even a submarine at one point). We also have a flight deck for Helo Ops, where I was a member of the refueling crew (we used JP-5/F44 fuel). Probably my most memorable time on the refueling crew was refueling Navy SEAL's helicopters during their ""operations"" for 3 days straight without sleep. After all was said and done, they gave us an air show. I've never seen anyone fly that close to a helo tower without crashing. SEALs have some badass pilots!

More than anything, I worked in A-Gang, meaning I maintained all Auxiliary equipment on board such as hot water heaters, air conditioners, forklifts/Yellow Gear, galley equipment, anchor windlass units, hydraulic steering gear units, and more. We worked alongside the electricians more than any other rate. It was a good gig. If you want to stay busy and feel accomplished every day, work as an EN on an LSD. Don't take that as a invitation, though, a lot of people hate it! I, however, honestly loved it. :)

With that being said, I sincerly think that Riot should just do a complete rework, or at least a hella bigger rework than they did recently on the PBE. 

Mobility is a SUPER STRONG thing to have in this game. Kassadin IS mobility. I mean, with that kind of mobility and also nice CC he should not be an assasin, period. He has to many things on top of being an assasin. I think they should change him into more of a utility mage or something along those lines...

T3chnopsycho,explainlikeimfive,1390902002.0,"Well seeing that most comments aren't that serious I'll give it a try.

First it is important to know which subreddits you are on. As I don't know it I'll point out different reasons I can think of:

1. You are just interested in all the knowledge on Reddit. You want to know more so you brows subreddits like Askreddit, Eli5, Askhistorians etc.
2. You are interested in Scifi, Fantasy: You like to fantasize about fictional things. You like to expand your knowledge of the lore from different franchises. 
3. You use Reddit to update yourself on news and things currently going on in the world.
4. You are in a subreddit about a game / games you really like.
5. You are a sports fan.
6. You are in a subreddit for a specific community that you belong to.
7. You just love reading all kinds of stories.

You say you are addicted. Well I guess this is just because you find so many things on Reddit that catch your interest. 

If you want a psychological answer you'll have to wait for someone else. 

What I can say is that today's youth is already much more adept and used to computers, mobile phones, the internet... than I was at the same age (I didn't get my first mobile phone till I was around 14). 

So naturally your preferences and ways of spending your time are different. When I was that age I wasn't really much on my computer. I did play computer games but my parents set me time limits to how long I was allowed to be on the computer (1 hour a day 2 hours on weekends but in total 8 hours a week). 

I spent more time playing with friends outside. Playing soccer or cops and robbers etc. I also didn't brows the internet that much and generally none of my friends really did. Things similar to Reddit weren't known to us back then. 

The reason IMO is that preferences shift with new technology being available to even kids (e.g. 4 year olds playing with iPads / 6 year olds having an iPhone). So you focus your preferences much more on things related to computers and internet. Also because this happens to probably the most of your friends as well it is clear that the trend will keep going that way. 

As to your other question: Star Craft is a Real time strategy game which is very known in E-Sports. 

Another point: If you actually feel that your ""addiction"" is not good and you don't want it. Well find something else to do. Like on user stated go to the park, go play with friends outside or just do something outside with other people rather than hanging out at home in front of your PC.

Kairos27,AdviceAnimals,1390902091.0,"You saying people who trust their partners get cheated on all the time does nothing to prove your point. People who distrust their partners DON'T get cheated on all the time. It is invalid to the argument.

 I'd be offended if my partner even for a second thought ""she cheated"" over ""sweet well we got super lucky!"".

There is a small degree of ""fair enough"" in the thought that you'd like a paternity test, but there's a much larger degree of likelihood that as a result she's going to feel very insulted.

Hence, I say, that their relationship is likely screwed now. She'll never forget the time he didn't trust her. Even if she did voluntarily get a test to ease his mind. He still didn't trust her, and trust is the core of a strong relationship."

Once you meet a few of them think if you click with any of them. See if there is one of them that you think, ""wow she's nice!"" You need to meet several because you can compare the nice one to the others so take your time. It's important that you ditch the ""dating"" mentality because you'll put stress on your relationships when there is none, you're there to meet girls and they'll like it because, like you, they are social and like to meet new people every now and then.

Put yourself out there. Is perfectly fine that you don't go out at bars, people there usually have their defensive barriers up and are more hesitant to meet people. Use private parties, group activities and places where you can talk to your hearts content and you have something common (an activity would be awesome) so there is less focus in the conversation itself, this will relieve tension for you.

Then when you meet a woman you seem to feel more fond of than the others, for whatever reason, try to escalate: ask her to go out to have a beer just the two of you. Nothing special but something just the two of you, alone."

But since it only cost $40 you have to set them both independently, which is kind of a hassle when you cross time zones.

I won't repeat everything, but /u/AnyRandomGuy is spot on about the phoenixes. They're designed to make the Zerg feel pressured, forcing drones to become spores, killing queens, sniping ovis. Whatever you can do to keep them back. Don't let your macro suffer because of it, but also be sure you're using them to their best effect. 1 oracle beats 1 queen. 2 can decimate a mineral line cheaper than 3 phoenix will.
  
Point - Since the phoenix didn't force spores or kill off queens or ovis, Zerg didn't actually take the amount of damage necessary to justify the use of the phoenix in the first place.  
  
How to fix it - Practice multitasking and phoenix control. If he's not building spores and moving hydras to defend with, either pull back and sweep the map for overlords or harass one base and send your army to another. **Bring your MSC.** You need it for recall once you snipe the base or are forced back. Don't lose unnecessary forces to take the hatch down. The main idea of harass and pokes like this are to force units over drones. Larva and gas are the crutches of Zerg. Keep the counts low and you can take better trades with lower tech armies for longer before he can make a switch.  
  
Secondly, you start to move out at about 15:30. Zerg is maxed at this point and had 39 larva in the bank. If you both traded equal, or even in your favor, Zerg can roll out 39 roaches or hydras and suddenly you have a 2nd army to fight. Try to attack earlier, again, bringing your MSC to allow for a recall. The Protoss war machine is powerful, but it's very tech heavy and your hard hitters are on the battlefield slowly. If you want to rely on colossi for your DPS, you have to continually hit Zerg with WP harass/zealot runbys so that his teching is slowed down and you have time to gather your army together for a bigger push.  
  
What I've found to work very well is attacking a base, sniping it if possible, and recalling as soon as his army gets a good position. Don't be afraid to pick off a couple units before you leave, but only if you can get very efficient (4:1 or so) trades. Every time your MSC has 100 energy, attack. If you get pushed back, then no big. It's free, and Photon Overcharge sucks against Zerg anyway. Also, whenever you attack, have a WP on the opposite side of his territory dropping/warping in zealots to snipe tech and kill workers. Never let Zerg feel comfortable or they'll just drone up to ~70, max out, and hit you over and over, then tech switch right as you start gaining an inch of ground.

I'd say start by reading a few tour brochures. Contiki, Top Deck. They all go to the same places for a reason and it gives you an idea of the ""must do's"" in a country and the popular tourist routes. You can either avoid them or copy them.

He uses words like you'd use an axe. His work is direct and unpolished, as he was a journalist most of his life, not a university professor like many poets. He received much criticism for the bluntness and force he used in his poetry, but I think time has shown his greatness to the world. My favorite poem by Sandburg is ""To a Dead Man.""

    Over the dead line we have called to you
    To come across with a word to us,
    Some beaten whisper of what happens
    Where you are over the dead line
    Deaf to our calls and voiceless.

    The flickering shadows have not answered
    Nor your lips sent a signal
    Whether love talks or roses grow
    And the sun breaks at morning
    Splattering the sea with crimson.

It weighs on the mind like a cinder block. The language is direct; there are no words that you'd find odd to hear in a normal conversation. The last line bashes your skull in. That, to me, is great poetry."

The level of organization and teamwork is pretty equal, with Arma3 having a slgiht advantage. Do not come into this game thinking it will be like Civ or any RTS, its not, the closest thing to strategy is commanding your individual unit but it will take awhile to achieve this because Arma3 tends to follow hierarchy.

SamTarlyLovesMilk,AskUK,1390904490.0,"You're right to avoid a car for travelling around London but you might want to look into hiring one to go to Belgium. I just did a quick look at fares for the next few days. The Eurotunnel day/overnight trip costs between £46 and £60 depending on the time of day. The cheapest ones being early in the morning or in the evening. 

To rent a car for just a couple of days is quite cheap, although you'll have to factor in the cost of petrol. It's about a 3 1/2 drive to Bruges from London, 4 1/2 to Brussels. Google is estimating about £35-46 worth of petrol for the journey to Brussels for a standard car with petrol being around £1.35 per litre at the moment. 

Look for car hires in south London to get the easiest route to Folkestone and avoid congestion charges. 

Obviously, there's other stuff you might have to factor in like insurance, public transport to the car rental.

Incorrect, this was known to Greek philosophers at least as early as 200 BCE. Even then, there's a non-trivial difference between circular and spherical.

&gt;you will find many prophecies that were fulfilled.

I did. Found zero. Lots of claims, of course, but none that actually stood up to scrutiny.

&gt;There are many occurrences in the Old Testament that talk about the crucifixion of Jesus.

Name one. Just one.

&gt; Revelation 11:9–10, Global communications foreseen

Just for reference, Revelation 11:9-10 states:

&gt;And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.
And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.

Please explain how this is a prophecy of global communication networks.

&gt;The Bible prophesies that the entire world will see certain events unfold.

Sure, but for it to be a valid prophecy, it would have to be a little more specific about how. As it is, it's (as usual) too vague to draw any meaningful conclusions.

Orelle,infj,1390904728.0,"The title's a bit rude, but Oprah's [got a quiz](http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Am-I-Too-Sensitive-Highly-Sensitive-Person-Quiz) nicely adapted from [Dr. Aron's site](http://www.hsperson.com/pages/test.htm). 

When I first read about highly sensitive people, I thought I may well be one. I can check off many ""HSP"" boxes — withdraws, yes, startles, yes, rattled, sometimes. But the reading had me focused on all the times I *have* been sensitive. Not all the times I'm not sensitive, and how I've become less sensitive as I've aged (or, rather, forced myself to endure all the situations that ruffled me, at length). 

Now I'm not sure if I'm an HSP, or just easily distractible and a tad flusterable; even that's not always true. Sigh. I *am* certain my mother is an HSP, and I think the awareness she requires may have rubbed off on me. I sort of ratchet back and forth between sensitive and oblivious, depending on the context. And I've changed a lot. 

For example, I used to be extremely sensitive to temperature. I cried a few times as a child because I felt ""too cold."" Nowadays, when someone pays a surprise visit to my apartment they'll often tell me it's freezing or sweltering. ""You don't *feel* that?"" Not really (anymore)!

Now, I have to say, the other three all appeal to me.

I think Strats look the best, and not being incredibly strong (and also quite small) a lightweight guitar is probably better for me. 

However the Les Paul sounds like it would best suit my playing style in terms of the sound and such.

Sounds like I should just go for the SG then, right? But I'm not so sure, I don't know how well I'd cope with a neck-heavy guitar. The colour doesn't bother me though, considering I like red and black.

I will say that my guitar teacher is selling a Gibson SG custom for a friend and he let me play it the other day, and it was pretty awesome. I didn't notice the neck-heaviness though so maybe I can cope with it."

Smark_Henry,MarkMyWords,1390904774.0,"The accuracy of that depends on your time frame. Will it be, for all intents and purposes, ""dead"" in fifty years? I'd say safe bet. Five years? That's pushing it. The site has already been around longer than MySpace and cultivated hundreds of millions more when it comes to the number of users. Almost 1.2 *billion* unique users go onto Facebook every month. In comparison, Twitter has around only 200 million in that time-frame. The mere fact that I could say ""only 200 million"" speaks volumes about Facebook's popularity. It's basically rivaled by only Google (and its subsidies like YouTube, which has a similar number of users per month) and to a lesser extent Yahoo (which has 700 million users a month) at this point, not as social media but as a website in general. Facebook is *massive*. We've seen other social media, but nothing on Facebook's scale. The lack of customization (meaning you can go to someone's page without worrying about having some band's MP3 and a hundred GIFs load) and the use of real names within Facebook's sleek interface keeps it more professional and generally stable, despite the complaints toward every small change, and that stability and sleekness helps it refrain from driving people off. People don't really have much other than ""I'm over it"" keeping them away from Facebook, and even they're tempted back by social urges that make them want to check in on all of their friends that are still there. Think of it this way: Twitter is considered by most to be massively successful. If 50% of Facebook's userbase closed their Facebook accounts tomorrow, what would be left of it would still *triple* the Twitter userbase. Facebook is a phenomenon and, while its popularity will someday fade like all things do, it's gonna be a long long time before it's ""dead"" like MySpace."

You can physically stop a child from doing bad things - take away their supply of illicit drugs, prevent them from getting a tattoo, whatever. But it's far better for you to teach your child why, so that they make the decision on their own.

Everything has a risk, it is up to the people to police themselves and decided whether or not they are able to do something. Obviously there should be laws against driving under the influence of drugs, and if there are some that are more detectable than others then there should be an immediate focus on them.

myrrlyn,teslore,1390905395.0,"The PGE is very strongly biased to the Cyrodiils. While it is not likely to be factually wrong, it will contain inaccuracies and opinions that are a deliberate part of the document's construction.

Orcs (and from *Oblivion*, ogres) are known to be directly associated with Malacath. *Oblivion*'s goblins are shown to have a shamanistic religion but this is not tied distinctly to Malacath. That said, there likely is some grain of truth to the classification of Orcs, ogres, and goblins under the term ""goblin-ken.""

I do not believe there is anything more than conjecture on the goblins-as-degenerate-Ayleids theory, but that's not really a bad thing.

I personally am of the opinion that Orsinium was almost, if not entirely, populated only by Orcs. Ogres don't seem to be the type for a settlement and goblins don't seem the type to stick in an area full of direct conflict and not much in the way of natural defense or hospitality. Furthermore, goblins seemed to have civil conflict whereas Orc civilization was largely bonded together against external threats, with only individual conflicts rather than Stronghold-on-Stronghold.

Beastman is, as far as I can tell, a pejorative term that is applied to any biped animal that looks nearly human. Though I don't think it's been used on trolls...

#[THE REST OF THIS IS MY CONJECTURE AND SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SUCH](#conjecture)

When Trinimac fought Boethiah and lost during the Velothi Exodus, Trinimac was not the only one transformed by Boethiah's power. Because the Aldmeri armies were strongly linked with Trinimac, they too received the change.

What Boethiah did was to turn Trinimac into his polar opposite. He still held the same ideals, but expressed them in ways entirely inverted from how he used to. Trinimac went from being the Strong Knight to the Bandit King. His Soldiers became Vandals - the Orcs. This is a pretty basic assumption, but **this** is pure conjecture: armies have more than just soldiers; the Scouts became Scavengers and the Laborers became Brutes - the Goblins and Ogres, respectively.

Although the location of the Transformation and where the armies were is not recorded, it's rather logical to surmise that it was somewhere in Cyrodiil. From there, the Transformed spread to the least-populated areas of Tamriel, which were the center and northwest, since the remaining Aldmer were in the southwest, the Chimer who'd just caused their transformation were to the northeast, and the southeast was of course impossible. For various reasons, the goblins settled Cyrodiil and the Orcs retreated to the northern hinterlands, while the ogres took to the wilderness between them.

Anyway, since then, the ogres stayed in the wilderness and regressed into more or less animals, the goblins moved to caves and formed basic tribal societies with extremely low-level structure, and the Orcs in the mountains stayed the least degenerate, with talented metalwork, a language, and complex traditions."

beyond that, a lot of institutions have capped placements and all of them have a standard of work required, so I don't see how saturation can occur when you are still required to be at a certain level and willing to do the work.

Rikkety,explainlikeimfive,1390906545.0,"Meat, fat and sugar are extremely useful to humans, because they are very easily converted into energy. They were also difficult to obtain for humans until relatively recently, evolutionary speaking, before we figured out agriculture. So when you were lucky enough to come across these glorious foods, you better take anything you can get. 

Humans weren't so much ""not supposed"" to eat meat, but it's hard to come by if you need to actually hunt prey. So until then, any meat we could get our hands on was a nutritional gold mine, hence the heavenly taste. Plants are much easier to come by, because they don't run away or fight back. They still taste okay, but they don't have the spectacular energy content of meat and such. They're just *okay*.

Fast forward a couple of millennia, we now have an abundance meat, fats and sugars. It still tastes heavenly, but we can get so much of all of a sudden it's starting to gum up the works. So, as is the case with anything, moderation is key. Now that we can eat as much of these high-prized, once rare food stuffs, we need to control ourselves, opting for the less spectacularly tasting salad every so often, in order to not eat ourselves to death.

Equipment progression is so linear that it can feel as though there isn't any, and the monsters may look different but they all behave similarly aside from a couple of different attacks, and drop the same things.

To be fair though, I remember the early days of Terraria when things weren't a million miles from where Starbound is today, so I do have confidence that it's going to become a fully fleshed out Survival Sandbox as opposed to the skin and bones house building game it is at the moment."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390906768.0,"Not bringing hard science to the table, but follow me through on this.

Upfront: I am definitely kinky. I have had sexual relations with both sexes, and previously have defined myself as bisexual.

I understand how sexuality is an easy thing to be uncertain about, especially the way people other than yourself feel.  I was unclear, for many years, on just exactly what was going on with heteronormative, nonkinky people. I'm not saying I didn't think they were right or good, just that I had no idea what their attractions were about, and really had a hard time fathoming it.

(1) Is anyone who engages in any kind of sex for pleasure hedonistic?  Even self-defined straight, 'vanillas?' 

Yes, the BDSM crowd and bisexual crowd talk a lot about sex. And many go about exploration of this in a hedonistic way. But how is any sex for pleasure NOT hedonistic?'

(2) 

&gt; temptation to indulge these kinks is strong

It took me a long time to understand, and believe that other people are NOT turned on by and attracted to what I am turned on by and attracted to.

I have 0 interest in, am aroused on 0 levels, in 'regular vanilla sex.' It is not that I am physically incapable of having it, obviously, I am physically capable. But it does NOTHING for me. If I was restricted to sex in this way, it would mean that sex had NO pleasure for me. Ever. With anyone, either gender.

I deeply love my husband. He is the only person I have ever attempted to engage in regular PIV sex with. It's only for him, and I don't mind doing things for him. But I take no pleasure or displeasure in it. It equally as arousing as peeling carrots or scrubbing my bathtub. 

I believe that straight vanilla people engage in sex for non-reproductive purposes and derive pleasure from it in general.

If I am not allowed to engage in sex, or what are most commonly non-sexual practices for pleasure, then that DOESN'T mean that I am 'not giving into temptations that I have above and beyond yours.' It MEANS I am not allowed pleasure in sex. 

It would be the same as saying you are never allowed to have sex, except for reproduction, and even then it will be set up in a way you can not actually enjoy.

I don't enjoy what you enjoy PLUS kinky stuff. I ONLY enjoy the kinky stuff I enjoy.

My point is: What makes me doing what I have to do to take pleasure in sex any more hedonistic that you taking pleasure in sex?


**EDIT:** left out (3)

(3) On bisexuality:

A bisexual person also doesn't have to be any more hedonistic than their gay or straight counterpart. 
For example:

What makes a bisexual person who engages in sex only in long term relationships any more hedonistic than either a gay or straight person that does so?

Or even if we are talking about promiscuity, that does not necessarily equate with hedonism either. Equal actions do not always come about from the same stimulus. Promiscuity could be about feeling the pleasure, or it could be self discovery, or examining what these connections we make with each other are and what they mean, or it could be from self loathing, or an inability to connect, or a fear of commitment.

There are hedonistic bisexuals, but that doesn't make bisexuality itself hedonistic anymore than heterosexaulity or homosexuaity."

argylepancake,mypartneristrans,1390906866.0,"Cis queer lady here. My ex was a cis lady genderqueer/androgynous identified lady, and post break up is now a trans* man. 

I, personally, feel more comfortable around trans* folk than cis folk. I don't think it's a kink/fetish/specialized sexual thing.  

I have a close lesbian friend who when we were trying to find a queer bar in our queer desert said, ""trans is my favorite gender"". And I **get** that. 

I have a hunch that the reason I find trans more attractive than cis is because of the emotional connection involved with fulfilling the attraction. I'm super empathic and can't be sexually satisfied with people without an emotional connection. And my hunch is that the connection with trans is deeper, or wider or larger or *insert-proper-adjective-here*. 

My genderqueer girlfriend once told me that she was able to have the most hetero sex with me she's ever had with anybody. That is to say, she was free to be as male in her head as she wanted to be because of the space I (without any effort) created for her. I really enjoyed creating that space. I think THAT is what makes trans attraction special for me. I can do a **thing** emotionally with trans people that I don't need to (not Called Upon to) do with the cis-gendered. Tho I've never been with cis identified lady. 

I'm in a hetero relationship with a cis dude right now and it's frustrating because I sometimes feel like I'm missing out on *something*.  And I think (now that I'm typing this here) it's that sacred emotional connection that I miss. I get this fulfilled somewhat because my boyfriend is into /r/pegging, but he's so goddamned straight it's... foreign sometimes. And well, Gay Desert. Not that I'm surrounded by homophobes or anything, but I'm so outnumbered by straights and hetero-norms I feel ill and homesick. "

anon_smithsonian,relationships,1390906983.0,"You're **not** expecting too much from a partner. 

Break ups are rough, especially ones as long as yours. My first bit of advice is to not rush into anything new too quickly. You'll probably need a good 6/9/12 months to really work through this. I suggest focusing on rebuilding your new life of your own, for now. 

And, when you are ready to get into a new relationship, I think it's important to discuss the matter of openness and honestly with the partner. 

My current girlfriend (soon to be fiance) and I had this sort of discussion early in our relationship, as well. Both of us had been hurt by significant others who had betrayed our trusts, so we both were a bit wary of being hurt again. But we talked about the issues and agreed that being completely open and honest was extremely important. This also includes the ""lie of omission."" We agreed that we'd both say what we were thinking--even if it was irrational/illogical feelings--so that we can talk about them. Both of us agreed that we would rather know the unflinching hard truth than hear soft, candy-coated half-truths. This has worked out really well for us. But a key to this sort of thing working in a relationship is both partners being able to hear these sort of things without getting upset/angry and having it turning into a fight. It's probably not first-date conversation but definitely one to establish early on, once things start to become serious.

Obviously not all people will be able to do this... and not all people may even want this sort of candidness in a relationship. But it seems to be clear that this is a quality that is important to you, so I suggest you definitely make it a priority. There **are** people out there who value this sort of quality in a relationship (and are capable of doing so), though they may be few and farther between than the type who do not. 

And, in my experience, it often takes age and experience for people to reach this point, so your ex's younger age may also contribute to this lack of shared value for openness and honesty. 

Anyways, I'm sorry for your troubles. I'm really glad to see that you can see the upside to all of this pain (i.e., gaining a better understanding of yourself and what you want/deserve/need in a partner) and that is ***really*** important. I was 28 before I finally found that right girl for me, so hang in there. Good luck!"

pakap,conspiratard,1390907247.0,"I'm French. This shit is really complicated.

This movement has clear anti-semitic overtones, yeah. But it's about more than. There's a real taboo in France about making jokes about Jews, with specific hate-speech laws that are much more stringent than in the US. This has various causes and lobbying is among them. So when a comedian known for making jokes in bad taste about...well, basically everyone was fined, harrassed and had shows banned after making jokes about Jews, it really highlighted that double standard.

Add to that general discontent and a nominally left-wing govt that completely gave up on its Socialist roots, and you find yourslf in a situation where the only viable, non-hypocritical political alternative seems to be these jokers. Traditionally the far left would have absorbed part of these people, but they're seen as more of the same - its main leader, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, is a Senator with friends in high places. Even the far-right party (National Front) is relatively silent, notably because a lot of these people are immigrants and thus out of their typical voting block.

The main backbone of these protests, organisation-wise, is the Printemps Français and its ilk - far-right, mostly old-school-Catholic organizations that formed in the wake of the anti gay marriage protests. But they too (like Dieudonné, like Communist-turned-nationalist intellectual Alain Soral) have tapped into a larger mindset of frustration with the way things are that transcends political barriers. When you go to one of Dieudonné's shows, you'll see all kinds of people - black, white, arab, middle- and working-class, teachers, masons, entrepreneurs, skinheads, anarchists...it's not just one class of people, there's a growing wave of discontent in this country.

What I'm really afraid of right now is that it would only take one really charismatic guy to coalesce all that anger in one direction. Things could turn really goddamn ugly here.

sporadically_rabbit,anime,1390907447.0,"When you're ranking shows against one another based on the average score, how does any of that mean that it would be a problem?  One would think that those rules are applied consistently (i.e. the difference between the number of people wantonly giving a 10 for Magi or Madoka will probably be a decent representation of the enjoyment of the people who watch each show).  As for 7 being the average score (assuming it is), is there anything wrong with that either?  I personally think that if a show's average, I'd probably give it about a 6-7 (depending on how much I enjoyed it).  Before you start complaining that that's too high, it's that way because I use the full scale, with &gt;5 being overall enjoyed, &lt;5 being overall did not enjoy, and 5 being borderline.  The only way that ratings are getting skewed upwards is that I'm not going to watch a show if I can tell in advanced that I'll hate it (so I have many more shows scored &gt;5 than &lt;5).

Long story short: Users are giving scores, not rankings.  These scores, once averaged, can be used to determine rankings.  The average score itself doesn't mean anything useful unless it's being used to rank the shows against one another.

There are reasonable arguments that should be brought up though, to do with sequels and show length.  With each successive sequel a show has, the vast majority of people watching it (and therefore who are going to score it) are those who have seen the previous seasons, and have enjoyed them enough to watch the sequel.  This removes from the voting pool in each successive season most of the people who will vote less favourably.  As a result, the average score for each season will tend to increase (assuming consistent quality).  With longer shows, I believe that MAL only accepts ratings from people who have watched a certain percentage of all the episodes (might be 30% or 50% or something), so longer shows are going to get artificially inflated scores as well (again, assuming consistent quality throughout), as people who dislike the show will often drop the show early enough to have their ratings not count towards the average.

To address Kuroko no Basket and Magi: What I think makes the tiniest little difference in whether or not they're ""above all other shows this season in quality"" (based on how my votes affect the average).  Unless you can claim to say that your opinion on the merits of a show is objectively better than that of another, there's not much of an argument there.  And while we're at it, we're not even directly measuring quality, as people can score shows based on whatever they want - quality, personal enjoyment, how cohesive the universe is in-world, etc.  But anyway, first of all, there's the above issue of both of these shows being sequels, so their scores will be expected to be greater as a result of losing their less enthused viewers in the 1st season, or between seasons.  They've also both been going since October, so their scores are going to be more stable than this season's shows, which are still in the tremulous early stages.  The scores would suggest though, that the average voting Kuroko no Basket S2 viewer tends to consider KnB2 better (through whatever metric they're scoring by) than the average voting Log Horizon viewer considers LH."

If you do not mind me asking, how much do you weigh (what is your physique like)? If you incorporate some strength training and increase your muscle mass a little bit (or a lot if you are *really* slender) you increase the constant load and strain on your bones and they actually get stronger.

Karate moves were formulated to be performed by stalky Okinawans. If you have ever known an Okinawan karateka, they look like walking tree stumps. If you are skinny/lanky, you should try to avoid the smashing blocks during sparring and practice using deflective blocks and traps."

Tell her that her actions have consequences and that she has single-handedly ripped away your future for no reason except to be cruel. Tell her that she is the scum of the human race, because she is.
&gt; And above all else, please do not let that cunt (excuse my french) turn this around on you and make it out to be in some way your fault. You are in no way responsible for her childish behavior.
&gt; And when you've done all that, tell her what you could have given her. Tell her that you loved her with every fiber of your being and if she had given even an ounce back you would have made her happy for the rest of your lives. Tell her that no one will ever love a person who could be so cruel to someone they claim to love, and that you will move on and be happy where as she will be miserable for the rest of her life because she has no idea what true love actually means.

silverionmox,belgium,1390908130.0,"&gt; What is a problem however, is a systemic discrimination of non-EU immigrants when it comes to employment.

I doubt that is true for, for example, Sout East Asian ones. We should take care not to generalize. It's tricky to disentangle discrimination on one hand and differences in education, language, family situation, role patterns, poverty etc. on the other hand, all these factors can influence employment and often non-European immigrants also have several of these other factors. That being said, it's an indisputable fact that non-European people don't get the chances they should (see the same cv/different name test), but as always we should not reduce the whole issue to just one factor. For example, the labor market in Flanders and Belgium is based on networking rather than skills. Who you know is more important that what you know. That in itself would disadvantage immigrants just as much as non-networking Belgians (and should change as well), but it's not racism."

IIRC the beat itself is simple, the difficulty is the speed. The snare/crash is on the beat, and the bass is on the offbeat. Just lock into the timing and put your snare/crash on autopilot. They just hit on 1 2 3 &amp; 4. If you can set yourself up that you don't need to even think about hitting the beats, that frees up your mind to worry about the bass drum offbeats.

That's not misleading, it's important to know. They contribute less (no social contributions) and most likely have more children, so they also get more benefits relative to other people. The system as it is assumes couples are generally striving to obtain two incomes. When people don't do as assumed that'll cause problems if the system can't pull that weight. I'm not arguing against the freedom to choose to stay at home or to have many children, but that means less income and more expenses from the state, so we should discuss which tradeoffs we're going to make to balance the books.

An issue that matters personally to me is why the mathematics building at UH Manoa is so run down.

(Sorry this is so long, but I think it's important.)

The campus is getting a new rec center, a new building for IT services, and various other building are getting upgrades.  Recently UHM got a new ICS building. Yet the math building has peeling paint, no air conditioning, the classrooms and offices are ancient, and there are no improvements planned.

I am told (just rumors) that each department is responsible for paying for their own improvements, and they don't have the money to (each department gets a certain amount of money per student).  However, *every* STEM major is required to take at least two calc classes, so where is the money?

I guess it wouldn't be such a big deal except having a shitty building translates into having shitty professors.  Apparently the department is *desperately* understaffed, but prospective candidates take one look at the facilities and turn tail.

It gives me the impression that UHM values a new gym more than supporting STEM programs.  The math department provides the foundation for all the engineering, biology, physics, chemistry, and ICS courses.  Shouldn't they be able to get at least a new paint job?"

digitalpencil,unitedkingdom,1390908836.0,"You're missing the point. Universities are businesses and students, clients. Cambridge is one of the most prestigious businesses of its type, in the world. It has attained this reputation for prestige through its high barrier for entry (only the smartest and most motivated candidates gain entry to a university like Cambridge).

With this prestige comes certain requirements; a preserved, historical legacy and a gentlemen's agreement that those who prosper at a university of this type, will go on to much greater things.

All businesses require funding. In the case of universities, much of this funding is garnered through fees, (students pay a set fee to attend that establishment) however this isn't the only source of funding. Funding is also acquired by nurturing the reputation of both the university, its alumni and fellows. Holding dinners for example, replete with the finest finishings to which its clientele are accustomed, are requisite parts of fund-raising through donations and its investment businesses. Any high-profile company would not hold a dinner for its esteemed representatives and clients, and serve up Lambrini. Cambridge is no exception to this.

I understand your reservation. The political elite are being wined and dined while the lower class are struggling to survive. It's a legitimate concern but a national economy is significantly more complex than the tallying of educational institution's expense accounts. All these things are about one thing, ROI. These events garner a higher return over their investment. If they didn't, they wouldn't hold them.

The_British_One,AskReddit,1390908973.0,"I prefer the the new UK system. 

Tertiary education should be a privilege and it is not suited for everyone. Making it free would just overload the university system with people who would otherwise go straight into the job market because they're not suited to University. However because it's free, there's no disincentive for them not to go. They go for the university lifestyle and experience, not to gain valuable skills in their field of interest to propel them into a particular career. This drags down the overall quality of a degree and also would vastly increase the amount the government was paying in terms of fees because the amount of people going would increase by so much.

The UK system means you only pay what you can afford (in theory so is Harvard's and Yale's etc., but this is different). You take out a loan which is sent directly to the university of £9,000 per year (the tuition fee), then also given a further living costs loan of ~£3,500 per year. If you're from a low income family or have various other disadvantages I think this can be subsidised and increased up to a £10,000 grant (grant not having to be paid back). 

You then have to do whatever else to fund your living. I'll probably end up getting a part-time job to supplement my living costs but that's simply to make my social life better (and possibly to make up the rent). 

But they key is, nothing is up front. You pay the living costs loan and fees loan back when you start earning £21,000/year after you've graduated. Your family don't have to pay anything if they can't afford it. If you earn below £21,000, you pay nothing back. If you earn above that, it steadily increases how much you pay per month. It's taken at source, so you don't even notice it. And after 40 years, any outstanding amount is written off. 

I think that's much fairer than expecting up-front payment. I know in the old system my parents wouldn't have been able to afford it, or at least certainly not with the new fees. With 3 children at university potentially at the same time, they could've been paying £27,000 a year up front, plus helping us pay for rent and still paying their mortgage. But in this system, the burden of debt is on the student. Ultimately it's their decision as to whether or not they think university is worth the debt they'll gain, and they don't have to pay any of it until after university."

rising_son,Guitar,1390909008.0,"First and foremost: take lessons. Learning from materials is fine, and I encourage you to do so, however having a teacher examine what you are doing will avoid you learning things the wrong way.

As for what guitar to buy, a cheap guitar will seem like the logical thing to do at the start, as you do not want to make a big investment into something that you might not enjoy, but spending a bit more will buy you an instrument that is more reliable, better sounding and will inspire you to play it more. The Pacifica series from Yamaha includes great guitars at low prices.

When you start to play there are some physical barriers that will stand up against you, which may cause you to struggle, and even hurt (at times) however if you persevere you will overcome them.

Take your time when learning, guitar isn't a competition, and ignore all the shredder kids at the guitar shop. 

Practice slowly at first, so that you are playing things correctly. If you try to rush into things you aren't ready for, you will make mistakes, and are therefore practising playing your mistakes and not improving.

If you have any specific questions, just reply or PM me, happy to answer anything."

Maybe there is something else going on and he's unintentionally taking it out on you? It's too hard to say from a single example like yours.

What is **more** telling, though, is the fact that you are questioning it. This leads me to suspect that there may be other things which lead you to suspect this. Most people wouldn't start questioning if their long term S.O. of two years is abusive because of a single occurrence like this. 

As for whether he is being immature? Well, at 29 years old, I would certainly hope that instances of immaturity over petty disagreements would be minimal by now. If he acts immature about not getting what he wants over something like this, what is it going to be like when he doesn't get what he wants when it's something that's actually important? 

These questions are even more so important, right now, because you're not just asking them for **your** sake, you are asking them for your child's sake as well... so you make need to take some long, hard looks at your relationship and ask yourself some questions that may result in unpleasant answers."

Great article in many ways. There's a lot of great things about the Nordic countries but this article astutely points out that there's a lot of bad aspects too. There were some really salient points in it. This one really stood out for me:

&gt; ""neutral"" Sweden (one of the world largest arms exporters)

I don't think the author is saying that there are only bad things about these countries. I'd do anything for Britain to become more like them. He lives in Denmark, he could probably write an equally long article about the good things. But we've had hundreds of them, and zero of these, so there's no need for him to balance it in such a way.

I see this article as a response to the dozens that have been posted that selectively pick facts about the Nordic countries in order to portray them in a positive light. He's done the exact opposite in cherry picking facts that make them look bad, in order to show how easy it is to distort the true picture of a country. Basically, don't take the article entirely seriously. Read it, chuckle at some of the jokes, and recognise that he's merely pointing out that **no country is perfect** and that we need to be reasonable about the facts we choose to look at when determining the 'greatness' of a country.

Or maybe he is just an idiot. It's possible. But either way this is what I drew from the article."

mildjeffers,sex,1390909731.0,"I can comment from the other side of the equation.  I love sex with my wife but have masturbated shortly after sex before.  After sex he may feel like it's okay to indulge since you and he have just had sex and if he cums again that night it won't affect his ability to have sex again the next day.  If I masturbate and then I can't perform because my wife wants sex too soon after I feel like shit.  So, I deny myself porn when I think sex may be a possibility that day.  He should be willing to reduce the pornography/masturbation to be there for your relationship's sexual health.  However, if he wants to rub one out after you've just had sex I think that should be permissible since it's a big ask to have a guy come back for round 2.  

Pornography can be appealing because it's entirely in the head.  It doesn't require effort.  It's all about self.  Being married means that you've given up all other possible sex partners to be with one person.  Pornography opens up a fantasy world to explore all the things that you don't/cannot expect your wife to be.  Like flat chested or curvy or black or Asian or a lesbian or pregnant or Lara Croft or whatever...

The only kind of porn that I think can cross the boundary is the cam-girl stuff that exists now.  I think it's a bit over the line to interact since it's starting to cross over from fantasy to a sex act with another person.  This may be a controversial opinion on this sub-reddit though.    "

T3chnopsycho,explainlikeimfive,1390909854.0,"I've only played EVE for a short time and by far don't know all about it. 

I think this whole thing comes from the game being a large Sandbox. IIRC there are very few fixed buildings or places that are NPC controlled. The rest are space stations that were built by corporations (guilds) and are thus controlled. You can basically control entire areas of the game world if you are a strong enough corporation. 

The game is IMO very realistic as it has a functioning economy (with which you could even make real world money) as well as the fact that it has almost unlimited possibilities of what you can do. 

So because of the fact that the game is very realistic it is obvious that there will be conflicts. You have different races which are either allied or enemies. And of course you feel dedicated to your own race and want to show you are the strongest. So there will be conflicts. Also if I'm not totally wrong there are sorts of wars you can fight against other races (which are partially NPC organized).

And lastly: Well if you have a huge fleet of ships (in your corp) you will want to do something. And one thing to do is conquer. You want to have more power, more influence etc. and the easiest way to get that is by conquering others."

TheCryptic,electronic_cigarette,1390909870.0,"In a mech it's not the mod that determines your amp limit, it's the battery.  If your battery is safe at 30 amps then you can build a very low resistance coil, but going over 30 amps on a 30 amp battery is a bad idea.  If your battery is only safe to 10 or 20 amps then you need to build a coil that won't exceed that.  But amps is used only as a limitation in making your coils.

People like mechs because of the power (watts) they can produce.  The voltage is not variable on a mech.  When you make a lower resistance coil you increase the power, making more vapor.  But the problem is that you also increase the amperage being pulled off the battery.  So you can theoretically build a 0.14 ohm coil, and on a fresh battery at 4.2 volts that will pull 30 amps...  So you'd better have a battery that can handle that.  But that beast will also be producing 126 watts of power.  And obviously it'll drain your battery pretty quickly."

Could it possibly have something to do with the fact that they have absolutely no gender equality? Obviously it's not a financial limitation.

You're right, and I absolutely agree that the olympics have come to represent a setting aside of political differences. But the host country is also expected to provide for and respect the needs of the attendees. Meals according to limits of culture and religion are provided. Rooms of worship are available for those with different beliefs. Yes, Putin has said that nobody will face discrimination at Sochi, and I applaud that. But imagine this- the host country says they will not discriminate against any religion during the olympic games, but in the rest of the country anyone propagating anything other than their national religion is beaten and imprisoned. Would you support the olympics being held in that country? I think by now the world should have advanced to where that would be unacceptable.

I'd put some history of debtors prisons and indentured servitude with the obvious allusions that might make.  But generally make it fun.  How to make money work.  How to save with others is a good topic too.

What's the point of me only thinking about such things after my mid 20s by which time it was too late?  Had I know then what I know now in my 30s and blah blah blah self recrimination blah blah.  So I might even make said book semi autobiographical and showing everything *not* to do.  Depending on how young I was aiming it, possibly something about delayed gratification.  It can't be too young because then what I'm talking about is too remote and not too late because by then they *know everything* and aren't trying to hear.

I dunno, I'm reluctant to generalise black people myself but the worst problems in those problem areas I think stem from people not being taught these things young enough.  We love to spend spend spend and  not build and grow.  Again, I'm not talking generally, but just identifying problems in the problem areas.

Maybe I'd include a little piece about capital investment from sources that aren't banks for my older ones.   I've seen people with startup ideas fail and flop because they didn't have enough capital and they were too stubborn to accept not owning 100% of their idea or venture and end up with 0.

Greggor88,skeptic,1390910284.0,"Couple of things. 

First, I was curious about the repeated references to the ""National Coalition of Organized Women (NCOW)"". So I googled it and [look what popped up](http://www.skepdic.com/skeptimedia/skeptimedia117.html).

&gt;Adams lists several sources, but they all revert back to a single person: Eileen Dannemann. Few people would take a lone maverick seriously, but when you call yourself the director of the National Coalition of Organized Women (NCOW) people might think you're a whole lot of people doing a whole lot of work. 

Apparently, the so-called National Coalition of Organized Women is basically one person: an anti-vaxxer named Eileen Dannemann. She just so happens to be credited in the acknowledgments of [the study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3888271/) cited in OP's link.

Second, I skimmed most of the article — enough to determine that it relies solely on the self-reporting VAERS database which was taken by storm during the H1N1 vaccine hysteria. But a little more interesting, and possibly overlooked, are the references to our old friend Thimerosal in the conclusion. Thimerosal (AKA Thiomersal for you non-Americans) was an additive in many vaccines until doubt was cast on its safety during the [Thimerosal controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiomersal_controversy). As a precautionary measure, it was phased out of vaccines, despite the fact that Thimerosal was later [exonerated of its link to autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiomersal_controversy#Scientific_consensus).

The fact that the study continues to refer to a now-defunct vaccine additive that was proven harmless, in my mind, casts doubt on its credibility."

constituent,thesims,1390911160.0,"Completely agree with this.  The knowledge that Sims 3 is at least playable *right now* is of better comfort than waiting for a game that nobody knows about functionality on launch day.  Also, it would be a real 'kick the dog' moment if the release date is pushed back again.  Players were informed that the sequel would be pushed back to Fall 2014.  

Even if everything does go okay on launch, there probably won't be much initial content, since EA has a way of milking content through the EPs.

I'm still apprehensive about EA's commitment to **no** DRM ""always online"" connection.  I hope they maintain that position since, in the case of SimCity 5, it's already taken a year to remove that crippling 'feature'.  Again, I pray they don't reverse positions here because they should have learned that an ""always online"" connection doesn't work, particularly after pulling the plug on their now-defunct Playfish's label, The Sims Social.  With that *ahem* 'social' game, there was still limited gameplay.  Even with the prosaic characters and light features, the server response speed was agonizing.

We sat back from the stage but one stripper sort of sussed us out and tried to become friends with me and my other friend, let's call him Bilbo.

She wasn't that great looking but it is nice to have a woman pawing all over you even when you know it's for tips.

Eventually, at different times, I think both Bilbo and I let her lead us away from our table to another part of the room for a lapdance. This mainly entailed her dancing near us and then blowing on our crotches through the jeans with hot air, which was kind of nice but also a little bit like ""is this illegal?"".

Interesting take on what happened [with anarchists](http://www.privacysos.org/node/791)

Private contractors (might be in Defence complex, like Lockheed Martin) invented or invested in (bought out) a software program that automates all these types of things online especially for social media. 

Apparently ABC uses it, at least on #QandA to detect shills and trolls, guess it's just by checking age of account and stuff like that or just Tweetdeck. Wired article [about Twitter bots](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/10/tweet-bots/) 

[Centcom: Operation Earnest Voice](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks) by [Ntrepid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ntrepid)


Another interesting article about all this, had an Indian company Cyberoam about online intel that [predicted a Singapore biz bankruptcy](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/11/02/the-spy-who-liked-me/) 

[HBGary](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=HBGary) and software by [Palantir](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=palantir) are in this too. 

PR companies like [Edelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edelman_%28firm%29) (Murdoch's NewsCorp, Shell, Mormons and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are clients) and [Burson-Marsteller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burson-Marsteller) - Phillip Morris tobacco was/is a client. 

So if a political party has the funds they can do it too. Or pay a few people that are members to do it full time, budget of around $100k per year. Or just share it around and attach on to communications and interns staff to do. They do a basic version of it with Facebook and Twitter anyways.

mundabit,bigboobproblems,1390912034.0,"&gt;they should be freaking out over the fact that these girls who ""don't need padding"" are wearing two-piece bikinis at all.

My thoughts exactly. A two piece is suggestive by nature, In my opinion you need a little bit of padding to secure the top and prevent nip slips.

I'm a developed woman and I wear padded swimsuits not because I want to look even more developed, but because cold water+boobies= Highbeams, and the same thing happens when an 8 year old goes for a dip. In my opinion a lined swimsuit is less sexual than a girl in an unlined swimsuit with erect nipples. I mean, either way its all just part of the natural human body, But if we are talking logistics here, the nipple is the part of the breast people seem to want to cover the most.

 And lets face it, these are liners, the man in the video claims they are not, but they are, My girlfriend is a member of the itty-bitty-titty comity, and I have been lactating for the past 2 weeks, The house is full off padded bra's for looking developed, and also full of liners for covering up nipples. and what you can see in the video are liners.  

The suit is also for 8-16's, they are frustrated that 8 year olds are included, But the fact is that the colours, sizes and styles being made are attractive to that age group, its cheaper for the company to just make the one pattern, with the liners, and sell the one suit, the liners are removable so parents of 8 years olds can remove them, and 16 year old's can leave them in.

Why click on a link to a story about Miley Cyrus, and then commenting to complain about the story.  All you've done is show the newspaper that story generated traffic for the sit for those advertisers.  Now there will be more Miley Cyrus stories because *you* Mr complainer, encouraged them."

I do hope, again, there aren't as many as the mod. But.. BUT, if the zombies don't glitch through walls, if they are, you know.. obeying the same laws of physics as everyone else, and i don't get hit by zombies i can't see or lagged or whatever, its not so bad.

I have less problem with zombies that aren't glitchy, twitchy things, if there is 20 zombies in a street and they all come for me, i could theoretically shoot them all, and it'd be cool too.

its not cool if they rush me through walls, or when i shoot them, take 3 seconds to die and thus all get to hit me.

Also barricades, locked doors, and so on would make a zombie siege so much fun, and being able to clear a town or an area (so no infinitely spawning zombies) would be good too, so i can actually clear some part of down while our crew loots and so on. It makes it a mission, not a crapshoot"

Taken by someone in a lot of pain, they do what they are supposed to - kill the pain. But taken by somebody who feels fine? They're euphoric, they're probably the best feeling things you'll ever experience.

&gt; It just REALLY alarmed me how much he begged for more after, like he was instantly hooked.

Like I said I don't do opiates, but that's not incredibly different from my experience with this research chemical called XLR11. Once I tried it, I opened Pandora's box and experienced a euphoria sobriety couldn't offer me, and I immediately wanted more of it. I never stopped wanting more of it. I got hooked, got clean, relapsed, and I'm now clean again and waiting for them to finally make this shit illegal so I can't just go buy it in a liquor store anymore.

Sorry about that rant, I went off-topic. OP, I'm really thinking you should just ask him straight up if he has a problem.

Eh? The first section had your basic militia. Then the second had the swamp monsters. The third had the ice soldiers. What's more, unlike 1 where most enemies were cordoned off in their little zones, these enemies often inter-mingled, so you'd have militia grenades and ice-beams from the bigger ice soldiers to dodge, at the same time.

&gt;Also it was dumb that R2 could only either be ice jump or telekinesis, but not both. IE if I wanted to use both (which I did because they were both really cool) I would have to pause the game and tell it which power I wanted R2 to correspond to every time I wanted to switch. Bonus dumb points because ice jump could ONLY be used when not aiming and telekinesis could ONLY be used when aiming (IE the button could be used for both and never have any problems ever).

The quick-swap (right on the D-pad IIRC) would move between your current power and your others, in order of which you selected last. So R2 - D-pad - Aim+R2 got you Ice Jump -&gt; Lightning Tether without pausing."

Within a month we should have Sakho, Enrique &amp; Allen back. Our team will look a lot stronger then. I admit missing Lucas will hurt us at times, but I think we can adapt.

Man U have signed Mata. So what? They don't need him. They need a new CB, RB, DM/CM &amp; Striker. I don't think he'll do much for them. I don't see them as a threat.

Spurs are woefully inconsistent. They haven't signed anyone. I don't see them really threatening unless they properly start to gel. But I don't see it happening.

Everton are our only real competition, but they're plagued by injuries too with a similar sized squad - but it's also weaker. If we beat them tonight, I have a feeling that will put a serious dent in their CL hopes. 

I think, the majority of the time we can out-score teams and then it's just a matter of hoping Sakho, Agger, Enrique &amp; Allen are back before we've played all of the top 7 to hopefully allow us to win at least 4 of those matches. 

You also have to remember that Spurs &amp; Man U have Europe, which will tire their squads a fair amount. And Man U's 2 best players (and only world class ones imo, except Mata now) are injured and out for a while yet. And we're playing all of the other 6 teams at home except Man U, which should give us an edge against them. 

So yes, I think we can still get top 4 even if we don't sign anyone."

The funny thing about it all is that i'd be happy to pay for a streaming service if any of them were actually worth a damn. As it stands, I pay more in usenet subscriptions for the explicit use of downloading tv/movies, than I would for a Netflix subscription. I'll reiterate that, I pay more to pirate than I would to 'legally' consume that media from a streaming provider. The reason is simple, Netflix sucks. It's not their fault, they're doing everything they can. The fault is at the hands of production companies who have attempted to strongarm modern distribution methodologies into bending to their will. As it stands, Netflix in my country is essentially useless without using a DNS proxy which technically breaks their terms of their service anyway.

The answer is simple, content producers have to relinquish their neutered stanglehold on legitimate distribution methods. Until then, all the money they could have seen, will continue to go to my usenet providers and they won't see a penny."

Anyway, good little post. I think your post overvalues Power by quite a bit, though. Once Boons really start rolling in and you also have full stacks, Critical Damage (and as a byproduct, Precision) gets **a lot** stronger.

For example, in any given WvW fight where I have full stacks, this is the total amount of +Power I have (on top of whatever I achieve from gear)

* +250 (Bloodlust)

* +100 (Guard Leech, or whatever it was renamed to)

* +200 (Food buff, after killing a player, flat +200 Power buff for 30s)

* +700 (20 Might stacks, easily achieved when running with the melee and combo'ing my Fire fields + Battle Sigil)

* +150-175ish from Sharpening Stone. This is often worth replacing with Oil if you are getting high Might stacks (and you have the other +Power buffs).

That is around +1400 Power which is very easily achieved when you are running around in WvW with a zerg. When solo I don't use the Power/Crit Damage food so +1000 is a more reasonable number.

It's good to see you trying to theorycraft a bit, but there's still some ways to go. It is great to see people touching on the massive amount of theorycrafting that can be done for WvW gearing. Hopefully the Ferocity change will not completely ruin this. :/ The change itself will take out a lot of complexity from WvW gearing and if it is too harsh it may end up making Critical Damage builds truly horrible in WvW. It is unfortunate that WvW will be dumbed down and possibly ruined as a byproduct of changes made for PvE.

What this post covers is part of what I will eventually try to talk about in a WvW gearing guide once the Ferocity change hits."

I've had some trouble with size too, because my SO had to through vaginismus last year, a point in time I really wished my dick was a lot smaller, because it would bring her nothing but pain anyway. Her biggest dilator was still over an inch smaller and exactly an inch less in circumference than I was, so the healing process was quite difficult.

Not to mention, we very often have to end sex early because it starts to hurt her. She usually ends with oral then, but as someone who simply loves going at it for as long as I can, it's a real bummer sometimes... Being hung isn't always fun.

Although, yes, I have to agree that I do feel great about myself when she can't sit on a chair properly after sex. It's a huge ego boost, but it's not all great. Sometimes I'd rather be a bit smaller."

That or literally ignore him. If he talks to you don't react in any way. Either he will attack you and get suspended, or he will leave. But, if you do this, things might get worse before they get better. If he knows he's not affecting you he will double his efforts before giving up.

A great way for visitors to save money on those costly touristy things is to print off some of the 2-for-1 coupons from [here](http://www.daysoutguide.co.uk/2for1-london).

Even if you are using Oyster, you can always buy a very inexpensive paper National Railways ticket and just use that in order to obtain your discount. I've read of people buying the cheapest fare they can and they say it is something like 2 pounds. If the use of the 2-for-1 coupon then saves you 18 pounds, it would be worthwhile. Further details on the savings can be found at the link above or [here](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g186338-c133479/London:United-Kingdom:Paper.And.Oyster.Travelcards.2.4.1.Offers.html)."

I had to remove the extra characters from the Lines (and Characters)

Identifying the invalid characters and the line feed took ages.

Once that was done, I used replace([fieldname], Chr(13) &amp; Chr(7), """") to replace the line breaks etc with no characters.

This allowed me to normalise some of the data, and create both a Character table, as well as an Episodes Table.

I created the following SQL queries to do append episodes, lines and charaters into separate tables.

I then created VBA code to loop through each line, and split the words based on a space.

This was then used to insert into the Words table.

wufoo2,sex,1390913768.0,"Well, you're certainly blessed to have a GF who understands and works with you on this.

I have an idea that might help, based on my own experience. And it doesn't involve permanent loss of your foreskin.

I used to soap and wash my glans and inner foreskin daily, thinking I'd be more presentable to a potential sex partner. But what I ended up with was a shrunken foreskin that no longer closed at the end; a hypersensitive glans that didn't like being touched; and a bad-smelling penis. (The last one because a dehydrated glans and inner foreskin absorb urine, rather than repel it.)

Somewhere I learned that the inner foreskin and glans are mucosa, not skin. Soap has no business there, anymore than inside our eyelids or nostrils. And the inner foreskin is [self-cleaning](http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/inspect.htm), again like the eyelids, so regular, deliberate washing actually does more harm than good by stripping away the natural substances.

So I started by eliminating soap and after a wash, not drying the glans before closing the foreskin. I started seeing more of my foreskin then, and if I went a few days with no washing at all, it got even longer and more pliable. As long as I rinsed before oral sex, my wife was fine with that.

Then, because I didn't make enough smegma to recover from nighttime erections and even weekly rinsings, I would add a thin layer of pure aloe gel to the glans before closing, and leave it there. I immediately got a much longer foreskin and the return of the ""pucker"" I hadn't seen since puberty.

But the surprise benefit was normalized sensitivity. My glans no longer made me jump when touched. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but a moist glans seems to handle contact better than a dehydrated one. Maybe it's because a dry glans within a foreskin can't form the [keratinization](http://www.stopthecut.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/12336060979711.jpg) (NSFW) that protects circumcised guys from friction. So it's an uncomfortable middle.

Anyway, now my sensitivity is just fine. My wife can even do something that would have had me howling before: after my glans has dried a bit in the open air, she can administer a ""dry rub"" with her fingers to the glans and whole inner foreskin, sliding loosely and rapidly from top to bottom and back. It feels so good it makes my eyes flutter. She also prefers the softness and suppleness my foreskin has now.

I hope this is useful to you. It won't cost you anything (aside from a bottle of pure aloe gel, perhaps) and if it doesn't work you can always try something else.

While unappetizing, [smegma](http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/inspect.htm) is really a sign of good health and it keeps the mucosal surfaces properly conditioned. Soap is especially damaging; we wouldn't soap our eyeballs - even if it didn't sting - because we'd be stripping away their natural protections. Likewise, soaping the glans leaves it dry and hypersensitive. One sign of this is, when you open your foreskin all the way, it clings to the glans, with a little or a lot of pain in separating. (This would also explain why your foreskin no longer closes over the urethral opening! It's shrunk from dehydration.)

If you're soaping under your foreskin, stop. If you're rinsing daily, stop that too. Let the natural secretions return by keeping the foreskin closed as much as possible. You can speed the healing with a thin coat of pure aloe gel on the glans before closing. In fact, if you do that, you'll see a noticeable increase in foreskin length within hours.


A rinse before oral is all that's necessary. Women understand this; remember, they're not ""oral ready"" 24/7 either."

wordserious,AskReddit,1390913862.0,"My wife and I did this, although at first that was not the intention. We are both Brazilian. She came to Colorado to earn her PhD. While she was doing that I got bored and found a job in IT- as the spouse of a student visa holder (hers a J1 visa, mine a J2), I was entitled to a full-time work visa.

At first this was just to keep me from going insane with nothing to do, but then we had a child, I did a good job at my work and was promoted several times and they offered to sponsor me for permanent residency.

The whole process took 10 years, and we finally received our green cards last month.

So what you are planning to do is possible. I would suggest you don't go to the major centers: not New York, not California, definitely not Florida. Maybe Washington State, Colorado, or one of the smaller Eastern states. Avoid the South. Do some research and find a place where there's enough of a job market and where people are friendlier to foreigners. Don't forget that the US is still recovering from a major recession and the job market is depressed. You will find a lot of competition, as well as people who don't very much like the idea of more people coming to the country to compete with them.

The one thing that is an absolute must: hire a reputable immigration lawyer the moment you set foot in the country. Immigration law is complicated and if you don't follow the rules you can very easily end up deported. My lawyer charged $150/hour and was worth every penny.

Another important thing: respect. Realize that you are not going simply to a foreign country. You are going to where people live. These people have a history, a culture, a way of doing things that are very different from what you are used to. Assume nothing. Research, learn, ask questions. My personal experience is that most Americans are welcoming, friendly, and helpful, if you are respectful and honest. We made several life-long friends here.

I can't speak for Canada, other than what my college buddy told me, who moved there: immigration law is simpler and it is faster and cheaper to become a resident."

Our default defensive expression is anger (""what are you looking at, lets fight!""), it is what we fear the most ourselves. Women’s default defensive expression is disgust (""what are you looking at, ewww creepy!""), so don't take it personally if you get some seemingly undeserved comments or looks. Just give them some space and try to put them at ease.

That being said, don't think of it as ""talking to women."" Think of it as talking to a new person whom you want to put at ease and make comfortable. Remember that women usually get guys at bars coming up trying to chat them up, so they won't always be 100% receptive right away. Just start light and be considerate. This usually works.

All these variables depend on where you are. A normal college-ish pub is the best place for meeting and talking to normal-ish people. I have pretty good confidence in saying funny stuff, usually about myself so as not to accidentally insult someone who may be feeling a bit touchy (they may be shy too).

As for ""bad"" shows, while they might still have a reasonable score, the rank will show how viewers consider it, compared to other shows (to use your example, Musashi Gundoh is ranked worse than 4500th, which is pretty bad considering that a fair proportion of the shows behind it are one-shot hentai and the like).  For Code Geass R2 to be that highly ranked, then it must mean that amongst people who watched (or amongst the &gt;188000 voters), it's considered to be ""very good"" (or equivalent in their scoring system) on average, despite what the director might think.  To use a similar example, I believe the band Toto almost didn't put Africa on their album, thinking that it would be unpopular.  Public opinion seems to disagree.  Another one is Clarke Gable hating Gone With the Wind (did it purely for the money IIRC)."

VincentGrayson,Rift,1390914271.0,"Read the links posted, but the basic gist of it is this:

Say you have a ""fireball"" ability that does 50 damage, and a ""flame storm"" ability that does 200 damage with a 30 second cooldown. If you make a macro that puts ""flame storm"" first, and ""fireball"" second, each time you hit the button for that macro, it will first try to cast ""flame storm"", but if it's on cooldown, it'll just cast your standard ""fireball"" ability.

It gets far more complex than this when you add a bunch of abilities, but the jist of it is that you can engage in combat/healing/buffing/etc in a way that lets you be more efficient (always using the abilities you want as soon as they're available) and making more room on your bars for the important situation-dependent abilities."

umilmi81,rpg,1390914423.0,"Dungeons and Dragons is a good place to start because it's well established and the current version is pretty streamlined (read as dumbed down).  They also have an online character creator.  Buy one subscription and give the login to your friends.

Character creation can be the second hardest part to getting in to roll play (and also the most fun).  Having a character creation wizard makes it newbie friendly.  The hardest part though is running the game.  You need a dungeon master.  As the person organizing it that probably means you.  D&amp;D also has a lot of premade adventures you can buy and run until you get your sea legs.

The downside of D&amp;D over other systems is it can get pretty expensive pretty fast.  With other RPGs you can just buy one or two books and play for years with no further investment, but that comes at the cost of learning curve.

&gt; I didn't think she was the type of girl who would either

I think you'd be amazed how common it is. I'm sorry OP, but I think you've just been profoundly ignorant as to how promiscuous society in general is and are coping with this rude awakening.

&gt; told me once she hates men who play the filed (believe me the irony of that statement has not been lost on me)

I don't know why that's relevant, the two dudes were friends with benefits (meaning they were also friends, it wasn't just a relationship about fucking). And it's not only men who play the field who have one night stands, it's just that they typically have a high number of them.

&gt; has even called a couple of her co-workers sluts on more than one occasion and not in the friendly joking kind of way.

That to me is not cool from anyone, but whatever.

&gt; So whether I'm right or whether I'm wrong I consider sex to be part of a relationship, although yes I am perfectly aware that not everybody feels that way. In fact I am beginning to think I may be one of the last few people who feel that way.

There is no right or wrong to it, sexuality isn't something that is inherently tied into morality. You're certainly not one of the last few people to feel this way, what is really happening is that it isn't as stigmatized nowadays so people are being more honest about it."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390914939.0,"I understand better now what you mean, I tried to read the other posts, but didn't quite get it, thanks for this clarification.

I believe that when people say they are attracted to men, they usually mean that they are sexually aroused by the sight and experience of the male body, but generally **also** the male human that lives inside it.

And that when someone says they are attracted to women, they usually mean that they are sexually aroused by the sight and experience of the female body, but generally **also** the female human that lives inside it.

Perhaps the biggest difference that I can point to is the non-sexual aspect of bisexuality. That is, being able to enjoy an actual relationship with the person, not just sexually enjoying their bodies. And a bisexual person would enjoy a romantic relationship with someone (that they like) of either gender.

Take someone who courts and doesn't engage in sex before marriage. How could such a person be a hedonist in the sense we are talking about, even if they court both genders?

Or even if not taken to that particular extreme, what about the part of a relationships before any sex is involved?

People that describe themselves as bisexual, IME, aren't trying to ""have both"" genders.

It is more that gender isn't the point, and they are attracted to whoever exists behind the gender. *And* they are also able to enjoy whatever body that person happens to live inside.

I know a couple of asexual bisexuals. That is, they are not interested in sexual activities, but enjoy romantic relationships with people of either gender.

But this is a *really* good question.

I have recently begun thinking about what we mean when we talk about ""sexual orientation."" Do we mean with what type of person you are interested in pursuing sexually? Do we mean that type *must* be about gender? What about when it's not that gender has restrictions, but is *completely* irrelevant, as in some fetishes, like mine? (edit: Or what about outside of sexual activities? Are we talking about the gender of people you can have romantic relationships with?)

It's not that I like both men and women, because that implies that I just like everyone. I enjoy some people. I enjoy the company of some people in a romantic way, or in a sexual way, or both. And the qualities that I need that person to have in order to enjoy their company have nothing to do with their gentitals.

Now, if it is true that sexually being aroused by a particular gendered body, (or both gender's bodies), is actually necessarily part of the definition of heterosexual, or homosexual, or bisexual, then I can't really be any of those things.

But if romantic relationships are also important to these distinctions, then I do fit under the orientation of bisexual, because I have had meaningful romantic relationships with members of both genders.

I think you are thinking about bisexuallity only in the realms of sexual activity, and not at all about the romantic relationship aspect that is a part of our current definition of sexual orientation.

VincentGrayson,AskReddit,1390915403.0,"The entire Call of Cthulhu campaign I played from 2002 until maybe 2006-7. We set it in the very near future, and all of us (including the DM) made characters based on alternate versions of ourselves. The overall story was what you'd expect from CoC, lots of madness and cultists and scary shit, but it all felt more personal because we were playing versions of ourselves. This also made the DM hesitant to kill people off, but that actually worked out well, as it meant more survival, more living long enough to go mad, and a whole lot of crazy fun.

I think the best moment for me was when we failed to stop a ritual just outside New Orleans that ended up summoning a Katrina-esque (this was pre-Katrina) hurricane. We ended up stuck in a slowly-flooding hospital with no hope in sight until one character (who had lost most of his sanity) finally saw ""through"" the corners of the room we were in, and was able to cross through some horrifying dimensional space while tethering the rest of us behind him, to escape the city.

It was a damn great game, with a fun rotating cast as friends' lives took them other places in the real (and CoC) world, and I doubt we'll ever have that experience again, since everyone is largely settled and too busy with family for 8 hour gaming sessions these days."

T3chnopsycho,explainlikeimfive,1390915452.0,"I have only played DotA for a limited time but have been playing LoL for around 2-3 years now. 

From what I heard and experienced DotA is much more complex than LoL. It has more items, more stats and generally there generally is a higher skill cap. 

Now of course if I had to recommend one I'd say LoL (but well I'm biased so I'll leave that out). IMO both games are in the end similar and I guess as long as you don't play on a professional (or at least high skill) level it doesn't really matter. It could be that you'd get bored if you totally own in LoL and find it too unchallenging. But that is a big uncertainty so don't break your head over it. 



I don't know about DotA but other have written there is no ""pay to win"" component so I'll have to say LoL could be considered more pay to win. But I personally don't think so as the only things you can buy with real money are things you could also buy with the ingame currency (Influence Points short IP which you gain after every game played). 

And even if you buy things with real money it doesn't give you that big of an advantage.

I'd recommend you just try both of them. They both have tutorials (although the DotA tutorials are a bit bigger and more detailed) and then you can decide which one you like more.

Also a side note League of Legends is not a Blizzard game but a Riot game which was founded by people who were previously involved in the development of DotA 2. "

The fear of rejection is powerful, but if you don't try then you are just rejecting yourself for them. Some will reject you. In my personal experience, most will, but I'm a guy so it will probably be a little easier for you. You've got to accept that rejection will happen but that's OK and you learn from it and move on.

-----------
When I was five, I watched my mom try to kill my father with a meat cleaver. He ran into my room and shut the door on her. His palms were flat against the door to keep her from breaking it down. The meat cleaver cane THROUGH the door. We got all new bedroom doors in our home that weekend. 

At the time, my father had yelled at me to call my grandfather (my mom's father). They lived 10 minutes walk away. My grandpa and aunt (older sister of my mom) came over and stopped the insanity. 

I honestly believe that if my father had not run into our room, my mom could have chopped him. 

Growing up, I was victim as well as witness to countless acts of violence on my mother's part. I never did anything about it. My father never did anything about it... I remember as a kid trying to hide behind his legs when my mother was about to beat me, and my mom screaming at my father that if he didn't step aside, he would be sorry. 

Traumatic experiences are always the most vivid memories. I'm sorry that your children will remember most of the struggle you're currently facing, but they will remember you as a hero. 

When I was 9, my parents had another baby. My mother wasn't abusive to the baby obviously. Until he turned 3. I made sure to always be around my little brother so my mom couldn't hurt him. The first few times she beat him, I was at school (hah... couldn't bring toddler to high school). I would come home and there would be a myriad of bruises all down my little toddler brother's back. It broke my heart so much, but at the same time I was so scared.

I called the police on my mother for the first time when I was 15 and my little brother was 6. I did this because my 6 year old brother looked me in the eye and said he wanted to kill himself. When I asked him why, he said because my mother had caught him eating chocolates and she told him she was going to ""deal with him"" when she returned from an errand. 

I've called the police many times since then. Police never took things seriously enough to contact Social Services. My mother finally got a warning when my little brother wrote an essay about her abuse at home and the school counselor was smart enough to get Social Services involved. Even then, they only gave her a warning. 

The thing is... police kept telling me that even though they have our statements, the abuse wasn't severe enough to involve Social Services. There was no lasting damage to be seen (she would slap us really hard on the back of our heads, or shove us) and without ""real evidence"", they were reluctant to proceed further. 

There were also many times the police officers would ask my young brother, ""You do realise by reporting your mother, she WILL go to jail, right? I just want you to understand the gravity of what you're doing."" 

And of course, my little brother would be scared. He didn't want my mom to go to jail. Neither did I. 

Regardless, my mom was finally arrested when I was 23. My brother was 14 at the time and she had hit him across the face and head so hard that he was bleeding from his mouth. I didn't live at home at the time, but neighbors called the police when they saw my mom raging from the kitchen window. Police arrested her on the spot because my brother was bleeding. 

She was charged by the Province with assault (criminal law), so it didn't matter that whether the kids pressed charges or not. Even then, Social Services stayed out of it because my 14 year brother already had a legal guardian (me). 

Bureaucratic BS? I know exactly what you are talking about. I am SO HAPPY for your children that they have a father like you. My mother's family also had the same mentality... my aunts would always guilt me for calling the police by saying, ""your mother has trouble controlling herself when she's angry, but she's still your mother. YOU DON'T WANT HER TO GO TO JAIL, DO YOU?"" 

All I could think of whenever they told me that was WHAT ABOUT US. WHAT ABOUT THE BRUISES ON MY BROTHER'S BACK THAT I HAVE TO RUB MEDICINE ON. How does my mother's *inability to behave like a responsible human being* excuse her from her actions? 

After my mother was arrested, my aunts finally said, ""she was always like this, since she was a kid, we were always so worried about her children."" 

Oh yah, they were ALWAYS SO WORRIED. Not worried enough to help us though. 

Sorry to have posted this long crap story of my life. I just wanted to let you know that you are a great father and your children WILL thank you. They will remember their mother as a violent person (children are sensitive to emotion) and they will come to understand that what you're doing now is the right thing. 

Best of luck.

Add in the few patients who are on telemetry, which alarms at the nursing station for every little thing, and you honestly start to tune it all out.

I remember once, we had a little old lady on telemetry, but being confused and restless, she was *always* fidgeting and trying to climb out of bed, so she was often restrained. As a result, her telemetry always showed artifact and so was frequently alarming. One day, I was sitting at the nursing station (shocking, right?) and her telemetry alarm was going off on the monitor. At first, I waved it away as her moving around again - the wave form looked really ragged, like artifact, with a heart rate reading of ~190 - but after maybe about 5 minutes of this, the wave form looked the same and the alarm wouldn't stop.

I figured I should check it out, even though she wasn't my patient, and even if things were ok, I should at least calm the patient down. I went and peeked in and found the patient sprawled on the floor, bleeding. She had apparently managed to escape her restraints, climb over the side rails, and had fallen, injuring herself. The ragged telemetry reading was because she was trembling while on the floor. So, yeah, that wasn't a good outcome :/"

Does this make me a baby? I suppose that's up to you to decide but I think that would make anyone who carries any sort of self defense item with them or keeps one in their home (mace, tazer etc...) a baby as well.

I'm also a die hard liberal and think certain things need to be changed about gun laws and gun control.

I also believe that guns are a historic part of our culture and it would be silly to outright take them away. Perhaps I'm just a baby though.

GTnicholas,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390916515.0,"Definitions are used to clarify tools of communication, I would recommend that if you are going to use the word freedom to characterize ontological independence (which by the way there is already a word for this) that you should make it known or you will be deceitful at some level.

Also, an implicit premise in your first statement is that without ontological independence, traditional notions of freedom (ie, the ability for one to act according to their will) are meaningless. I do not see this connection. Does the fact that my continued existence is reliant on the nature of the universe really remove meaning from the ability to act according to my will? What of the actually evident happiness and desire for the later throughout human history? From the Spartican slaves of Rome to the existentialist philosophers of the 20th century, great longing for freedom in this sense has been very prevalent, and once it is achieved, great happiness as well. 

Your definition points to a different idea that the one talked about when we say freedom, this does not foster but hinders communication. Furthermore, you have yet to prove your claim that without ontological independence, freedom in the actually used meaning of the world is somehow bad, either in failing to provide meaning, or in failing to provide happiness."

GeoffreyArnold,short,1390916714.0,"This essay is especially hard to read because it is appears to be written in a stream of consciousness style.  It took me three days of off and on reading in order to slog through the entire piece.  The thoughts are a bit disjointed and the author often goes off topic for paragraphs at a time.  But, it's ultimately worth the read because he describes some of the things that all of us have to deal with as a short man living in a heightist society which loathes the short male body.  We may not be able to relate to everything the author says, but all of us can relate to something.

Here is an excerpt that pretty much sums up the whole essay:

&gt;Short men will: have women say that height doesn't matter, have kids come up to them in grocery stores and measure themselves next to you, hear girlfriends make excuses for your height to their friends and parents, have parents be ashamed of you, have your own children ask why their father is smaller than other fathers, have children afraid they will be your height, have women afraid your children will be your height, have jobs pay you less, be ridiculed by your peers, family and friends all because of your height and have height be the subject of their ridicule, will have a higher chance in being in a relationship with a woman that is less attractive in more physical features than himself [no hypocrisy], will most likely date and marry a woman who already has kids by a taller man, will have every accomplishment and failure in their life attributed to their height, will be told they have short man syndrome, will be run into in public by complete strangers 700X more than men of regular height, will have no one believe your experience as a short man, will constantly have to work against prejudices, will constantly be reminded by people telling them they are short, will find women want to take pictures with you while you are sitting down and try to not have you stand up, will have cousins not want you to pick them up from school due to you being short, will not know what it is like for other kids and family to be proud of your looks and want to show you or introduce you to anyone--yet in the same breath will beg of you to loan them money, find them jobs, let them live with you, and ask you to introduce them to other people, you will be considered on the outside of your own family with your parents and brothers and sisters, you will turn on the tv/radio/internet and see multiple images of other short men in demeaning insulting positions, you will not be able to find people that look like you that are admirable, you will be ostracized by your own race, religion, through stories, your own gender and opposite gender, you will be told it's all in your head like Cheshire the Cat, you will be mistaken for a child, you will be challenged to fight by both men and women due to your size, you will receive an abundance of people wanting to talk to you as though you are stupid or a child or someone not worthy of any respect, you will have people think you wear lifts, you will have people associate everything you are with your height, you will die sooner than the average male, you will have a hard time finding other men your same height, you will find that most people in walking or passing will pretend you do not exist and will not give you eye contact that they do offer others,you will find absolutely no support or recognition of the wrongs to you inflicted on you by others due to your height, if you date a beautiful woman you will highly increase your chances of having other jealous men approach you and make jokes about your height in front of your mate, you will have friends and loved ones say to you they are glad they are not short, you will be patted on the head, you will be picked up, you will be expected to act as though none of this exists and yet told you have the problem, you will endure this until the day you die or go to a place where you are no longer considered unusually short.

I *want that to happen*. How are you not getting that?

&gt; The friends you are happy to give permission for to find things out about you aren't the only ones who do, instead you have governments, employers, banks, insurance agencies at the very least all tracking and looking at your every word.

Ad agencies are really the only ones I mind.

&gt; And you can talk to multiple people at once without using a social network.

There's a difference between ""speak to multiple people I manually include in a conversation and notify of each message"" and ""throw a message out there, see who bites."" I don't want to bother anybody in particular, but if any of a huge set of people have something to say about what I have to say, let's start talking. That's not group messaging. That's broadcast.

&gt; Phones have had such features for decades,

Android only got group SMS in... 4.2? And the iPhone came out in 2008... and their systems aren't compatible... Iunno, does the Blackberry have group SMS? WP? Dumbphones don't, do they? Any phone with a browser (or laptop for that matter) can participate in Facebook. Again, you don't have to want that -- it's enough that *a lot of us do*. Are you trying to understand why anybody might like facebook, or why you should?

&gt; and instant messengers since their inception,

have sucked? Have never hit a global standard? Yeah, I know, right?

&gt; emails have a b/cc function

Yeah, that's good. But doesn't do the same job as broadcast, and fills up inboxes fast.

&gt; and you can certainly talk to an audience in real life if you so chose.

No, nothing he says about *why* he didn't tell you sooner will change the fact that this man is a different person to you now. 

Because now you know this:

This is a man who has children, whom he abandoned with his ex-wife. 

Abandonment is abandonment, regardless of whether his ex wife ""made him"" or not, he abandoned his children. 

His children will see him as the bad guy. The father that left them after a divorce and gave them up to their mom and step father. 

-----------

As for the ""what now?"" I think you should consider whether you can accept him as the person he is to you now. Is this flaw/baggage/whatever-you-make-of-it detrimental to your marriage? Or is this something you can accept and rebuild on?

I try and be direct.  If I just met someone and we hit it off I tend to specifically say something like ""this has been fun.  Can I take you out for a date sometime?"" 

I found in my experience (although I never really knew the word at the time) the best thing I could do to avoid the friend zone was by changing the way I personally thought about women.

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1390916971.0,"&gt;I could say the exact same thing about martial arts and learning a one hit kill punch, or making blow dart gun from a bamboo stick from the garden centre.

Really? Comparing martial arts with firing a weapon? Are you serious?

&gt;especially by a handgun which is LESS powerful than the shotguns or rifles that are already legal and widely owned in the UK

It's obvious shotguns are more powerful but it will be always easier to conceal a small gun. That's pretty obvious as well. Right?

&gt;The kids could also access the kitchen knives, the tools in the garage, the oven, the hob or many other dangerous household items which would certainly be less secured than a firearm

Come on, are you that hard thinking? Child can hurt himself with a knife but that in the worst scenario will be a small cut. Pointing a gun at your head and just firing it will kill you instantly. How can you compare such things?

&gt;Find me a stat for children who have got into the gun safe and shot mum by accident. Until then, you're pulling this out of your arse.

I don't need stats. It's very plausible and that's what matters here. Pure likelihood tells you that 1 in x people will forget to close the cabinet, 1 in x kids would like to play with the real gun etc etc. If gun isn't around you reduce it to COMPLETE ZERO risk.

&gt;If a friend wanted me dead, he could easily do, even without a gun

With a gun it's always easier. Just look at Pistorius' case. Accidental shooting because he shot being half asleep, knowing it can be dangerous burglar and possibly being more scared than he should have been. A life was lost just because he had a gun. If he wanted to defend himself he could very well use a knife or a spray pepper or cs gas. In worst case scenario he would only hurt his girlfriend. Kind of hard to stab a person via a door.

&gt;Please try to have a more open mind. We are not America and we never will be

Thank God but it doesn't mean that more guns should be given to people, especially because there is COMPLETELY no reasonable justification to have a gun (used for a sport) kept at home, especially a small gun."

I started hrt 40 years later and have no regrets.  I was always honest with myself and honored my feminine point of view, inclinations, but I also got busy living my life, as any cis gendered person would do.  I have three wonderful kids, I've traveled the world, had several meaningful and interesting careers, and basically lived life to the fullest I could.  All while being trans and not on hrt.  It reminds me a bit of my wife.  She has advanced degrees and, for the country she came from, did things women are not supposed to do.   She didn't let her gender stand in her way, and I feel that neither have I.  I had to manage awful dysphoria time to time, but I did manage it (not always in the healthiest way).  I recently started hrt, did laser, some ffs, orchi, because the dysphoria does intensify over life, but I could manage to live my life for a long time with out it.

Katterin,AskReddit,1390917226.0,"Tax accountant here.

Don't confuse deductions and withholdings, as some comments are doing.  Withholding is the amount that is taken out of your paycheck and sent directly to the IRS. A deduction is an amount that you are allowed to subtract from your gross income before you calculate your tax.  This can be itemized deductions like student loan interest or mortgage interest, or if you don't have enough itemized deductions to make it worthwhile, there is a ""standard deduction"" which is just an amount anyone is allowed to deduct instead of itemizing.

Also don't confuse the amount of taxes someone pays, with what they owe or get back at the end of the year.  Your total tax liability is based on your taxable income (gross income minus deductions and other reductions).  Then you see if you are eligible for any credits, which reduce the tax liability, and you look up how much you already paid by having it taken out of your checks.  If you had more taken out than your liability, you get a refund; otherwise, you owe.  The amount of your refund/amount that you owe is the number most people talk about when they do their taxes, even though the tax liability is the total amount of taxes paid.

Assuming she is single, not a dependent of anyone else, and under 65, her standard deduction plus personal exemption is 10,000.  In order to have tax liability of 1,000, she needs to have gross liability of at least 9,650 according to the tax tables, so her gross income would have to be at least 19,650.  In other words, if she had zero withholding and made 19,650, she would owe 1,000. But since we don't know how much withholding she had taken from her checks (and this can be different than what you have from your check, even if you make the same amount, because it is based on the number of exemptions you claim), it's impossible to know what her actual taxable income was based on the amount she owes at the end of the year.

**TLDR** We can't tell you exactly what she makes, but as long as it's reasonable that it's at least 19,650, there's really no way for you to call her out and she may well be telling the truth.

**Disclaimer** The above is highly simplified and should not be relied on as legal or tax advice by anyone."

Unrepentant_Priapist,patientgamers,1390917237.0,"I mostly agree with you, but there are potentially valid reasons to make the choice.

I'm primarily a PC player, but I bought the trilogy for PS3 because of the DRM in the PC version.  I don't have a constant internet connection, nor a lot of gaming time, so playing anything with much DRM (even Steam's relatively even-handed version) is an exercise in frustration.  I have a vague awareness that the PS3 has some sort of DRM of its own, but I buy the game, I put it in the drive, and it works.  I don't have any interest in pirating games, so whatever controls exist are transparent to me, which is the way it should be.  On the PC side, it's a crapshoot as to whether a game you purchase is even going to work, not because of ""incompatibility"" or ""wide variety of hardware"" or other assorted excuses, but because of DRM.  I've never had a game I bought from GOG or Humble not work.

Start with the mass of the spacecraft. I'll admit, I pulled that out of thin air, based on the mass of the space shuttle orbiter. Why don't you select a mass.

Next, pick the speed. Keep in mind, it's over 10 light-years to the nearest suitable star system, so I would think you want a speed that's a good fraction of the speed of light. You should look up the speed of light on Google or whatever.

With those quantities selected, I believe, you can calculate the kinetic energy. You can find the formula on Wikipedia or Google. It's not  E = mv^2 , as you stated. I believe if you start with meters, kilograms, and seconds, then the answer will be in joules, but you should check on that also.

So, what did you come up with?

Now, select an energy source. It could be batteries, coal, solar cells, nuclear fission; you decide. How much fuel is it going to take? Will it have a smaller mass than your spacecraft? If it doesn't then it's not going to work. At least that's my theory. What do you think?"

I think that goes for both your daughter and your husband. This is a lesson for him to learn he needs to remember he cannot control everything his children do. They need to be able to make choices and decisions.

Another thing I didnt mention last night when I responded was an American Girl doll is a real desire to a 6 year old. Getting the $30 target doll is just not the same. Try putting it in his terms. If he wanted that really awesome, amazing car lets say its a Lexus, fully loaded with everything you can imagine AND its the perfect color. Its something you can wait and save for and put aside for so you can actually buy it. But YOU, as the wife say to him, ""NO, I know you saved for years for that car and I know you REALLY want it, but you have to get a Kia because thats what I want you to get"" How would he feel about that?

If you are going to let her save money for something she wants, you cant back out on it especially if its an age appropriate item. Lets say she said she saved money for an iphone and a years worth of service on it at the age of 6, I think then it would be appropriate to draw the line."

stcamellia,explainlikeimfive,1390917644.0,"Gold standard had some benefits but there are really good economic reasons why pegging your currency to a ""real tangible"" thing like gold is a bad idea. Either way, modern economies have done away with the gold standard.

Some people are unhappy with this. Some people do not trust the Fed. Those who have a lot of money stored up think that ""easing"" or the printing of extra currency will devalue their savings through deflation.

So what do you do if you don't trust those who control your savings? You get out. Gold is a bad investment. So is the market (if you are paranoid).

So some bright people came up with this technology. It is secure. The math necessary to make it secure is done by the people ""mining"" it. People get paid in bitcoins to run the bitcoins servers, basically. 

Mostly, you can buy drugs or guns on the deep web, but more and more people are accepting this new crypto currency. Which means its value has gone UP in relation to the dollar. Had you bought 1k in bitcoins a year ago, it would be worth a LOT more today. But now everyone is getting into bitcoins. Which means everyone is stockpiling them. Which means the price is volatile. Which means it is a bad investment.

A lot of skeptics see it as a bubble, designed by hacker libertarians to profit off late adopters and the fearful. Until we have the Fed being ACTUALLY irresponsible or greenbacks not serving the needs of the people, there will be no NEED for a crypto currency.

TL;DR it is sort of a dog and pony show for those who love anything tech or anarchist."
hollywoodbob,WTF,1390917650.0,"If the bears attack them in their houses they're welcome to kill them.

This is tantamount to claiming that a burglar was within his rights to kill the home owner who caught them in the act.

If I go to a horse farm and get kicked I'm left without recourse because the law considers that activity to have an inherent rick of injury. I'm merely suggesting that hunting in polar bear territory holds a similar, yet greater, risk, and by taking on that activity you assume that risk and in doing so should forfeit your life should you be attacked. 

The bear isn't a salient creature, it doesn't have any willful intent, it is only acting on instinct, eat and survive. People are prey to it. Whereas the humans are acting in willful disobedience of what is best for their survival. Therefore I believe that the bear's actions have the greater natural merit and killing it is a completely immoral act."

dublos,OkCupid,1390917686.0,"**Photos**
Not bad, but continue to work on them.  Especially note that thanks to a manly brow line it tends to appear you're eyes aren't fully open and seeing the eyes is important.. hence your somewhat intense stylized picture is excellent.  You need to watch the lighting in the other pictures as having only overhead light is going to make it look like your eyes aren't fully open.  If you dabble in photography, you can do better than this.  

**Self Summary**

Second paragraph first two sentences both start with ""I like to"" the like to part is unnecessary in both cases and weakens the statement.

**with my life**

Thankful again?  Lose one or the other.   And which ever you keep I would change the order to what you do first and the fact you are thankful to have an occupation where you're paid do do what you love second.

**really good at** 

Solid.

**First thing**

Solid, but realize you now cannot show up to a date in a t-shirt and jeans unless specifically asked to.

**favorites**

Good.. but Food is conspicuously missing.  You mention pizza further down in what you think about but it's not enough of a favorite to merit a mention in favorites?

**six things**

Not bad, but for some reason I'm struck that none of those six things are alive.   

**thinking about**
Pretty good..  do you ever spend time about who you might be wanting to go there with or do those things with?

Pizza.. as mentioned before, move up to food.

**Friday**
Not terrible, but strongly introverted.


**private** 

Brain just went to Ben Platt's character in Pitch Perfect.  As he's a pretty endearing character I think that's a good thing.

**message me if**

Puns are the lowest form of humor.. but that's a solid one.   Add more, but still end with that as the last paragraph.

**Overall** 

Overall in your profile, there isn't any hint you have or enjoy friends, family, even co-workers.   You're not giving a prospective date any hooks for where she might fit into you life.    Listing cuisines or even favorite restaurants in the favorites section lets someone picture being there with you.   On a Friday night you're working at home while watching movies..  never out to a movie with a friend?  Some other activity your prospective date can put themselves into the picture for?

JustWordsInYourHead,relationships,1390918024.0,"Everything you listed of this one day in the life of your marriage says something very obvious:

- You and your husband are behaving like petty siblings to each other when you should be behaving like a loving husband/wife. 

Why is this? Does the tired expression ""familiarity breeds contempt"" apply here? 

Some questions:

- Do you and your husband have hobbies and friends outside of each other &amp; outside of your home? **If no, I suggest you two get separate hobbies and some separate friends so you don't feel so ""cloistered"" with each other.**

- What do you love about each other? List a few items here. **If you can't list anything, then try harder. If you still can't find anything, then it's time to re-date yourselves and discover new things to love about each other. Or you know, divorce.**

- Do you and your husband have any shared hobbies? For example, my long term boyfriend and I joined a dancing class together because our life together was getting too bland and we had begun down that road of attacking each other for tiny little things. We both live in a foreign country away from family and friends, so we just had each other... while that *sounds nice*--just you and  me against the world, baby--it can also mean that you've just got that ONE PERSON to be frustrated/angry with. That's not good. **Having a shared hobby outside of your home will help you guys FEEL like a loving couple rather than two cloistered people who relentlessly attack each other.**

---------

Please approach your husband with the questions I've raised here. If you don't mind me asking, what culture is he from? I'm Chinese Canadian and my partner is Westernized. It can be difficult for people in my culture to accept flaws. 

My partner was the one to raise the points I've listed for you above. He was the one to notice that we had become petty with each other. He was the one to bring it to my attention, and he helped me understand that identifying the flaws in our relationship doesn't mean that our relationship is doomed (and therefore a shameful defeat), all it means is that we know how to fix it now if we want to fix it. 

Best of luck.

So let me get this straight, you view a person who wants a paternity test to have trust issues. And what about in the example provided, you think that person has trust issues? The example was completely blind sided. Once again, **blind trust** is not the answer. Why would you view this man as having trust issues. There was literally no way he could have done anything the first time, it's not a matter of trust the second time, it's a matter of taking action to ensure his trust is correct. 

Let's take all human element out of it, and take a look at it from a risk benefit scenario. 

The benefits of not having it done, are nothing. Yet the risk is a small risk of 200 grand loss of money.

The benefits of having it done are the near complete protection against this risk. And there is no risk of doing the test itself. 

So if you could absolutely protect yourself against a 200 grand loss that you wouldn't want to do, with no downside, why on earth would you not do it. You don't seem to get that this isn't about cheating, or checking on cheating, it's about not wanting to ever, under any circumstances even come close to risking raising a child that's not yours. Even against the low risk of a hospital mix up, it is worth it from my point of view. The mechanism is irrelevant. 

From a risk/benefit analysis it's clear what action should be taken. "

This is interesting, but not really surprising. I think that the reason the ""alternative rock"" name was created was because of the shift in what ""rock music"" sounded like.

It's an umbrella label for the kind of music that started to become very popular in the 90s.

Generally I don't pay more than 20 and get the whole hair washing, facial and haircut/style of a ""real salon."" And fuck their tea is delicious and I probably consume 2 actual cups worth using their tiny little cups. 

I park in the ""remote"" lot at campus/work and I don't even drive in every day. Parking pass is a LOT cheaper and the lot fills up much later. I only drive in on days where I start and end at work - otherwise I just take the bus. I actually didn't have a car until this year for dissertation stuff. 

I have one morning class and one of my neighbors is a good friend and classmate. We make giant thermoses of coffee. It ""saves"" me about 4 bucks a week - not big I know but enough for a Whole Foods cheapo wine =P. On that note, I RARELY buy coffee out unless I am seriously riding the struggle bus from pulling an allnighter. My office has an insta-hot so I can always make my own tea. I did splurge and buy a K-cup box because I can keep it in my cubicle for emergency caffeine situations - still works out to be more expensive than a pot of coffee but I spend .50 a cup vs. 2 for a coffee. And I make it so infrequently, I've had a box since June. (Our Kcup machine is weak and I am convinced doesn't brew very strong coffee - unclear as to whether or not this is normal.)

Most of the time, I bring food to work. A few times a month, I will walk to the nearby Chinese restaurant to get something. However, their plates are around 7 bucks and can last me three meals. So, its not an awful deal (but yeah not super healthy=p). 

Edit: I also joined Influenster and get full-sized samples every now and again. Best samples that I've received include a FULL-SIZED face wash, moroccan oil, a hairbrush and some sea salt spray. If anyone wants links, PM me and I can totally invite you. I don't fill stuff out too often (basc just when I am waiting for the bus) and have gotten 3 boxes in the past year.

I am trying to use it as a method to maximise my damage and survivability in the front line of a zerg. I don’t want to be a super tank that everyone ignores, or drop straight away. I want to make the best balance I can. Hence this ratio of DPS lost vs EHP gained.

As others have said, you only need one cpu. Since you chose a Z87 chipset motherboard, those are designed for intel cpus so knock out the AMD FX-8320. The i7 4770K would go great but if you're not doing video processing, it really is overkill. The i5 4670K will give you the same performance when gaming and will save you money.

Case looks ok. My first case was similar but I ended up regretting choosing one with lights rather than cable management. Think of them as investments. If you get a solid case, it could last you decades and multiple builds. The R4 would be my recommendation here but choose what you like; you're going to have it a long time.

GPU is good. It pretty much runs at the same speed as a gtx 770 so if you can get one of those cheaper, I'd say switch to that.

so just talk over all of it with him. make sure he knows that you want to make sure he is satisfied as well, and if he really is ok with you finishing when he hasn't, then accept that. but you should offer to concentrate completely on him sometime, if he wants that."

dublos,OkCupid,1390918949.0,"I'm going to start by suggesting.. yes, go ahead and make a profile and start answering questions.

But I also think you desperately need to get out into the world and socialize a bit before asking women out on dates.   Start out by just going out and observing.. find a local bar/club where people your age hang out, get a drink and just take in what's going on around you.  Realize that the people in the room aren't watching you for a fatal social faux pas and learn to relax and learn in that environment.

Check out the local food scene, with a friend, or even by yourself, see what restaraunts are out there which you could take a date out to.   

Get more physically active.  If you feel overweight and out of shape, start an exercise program.. just working on fitness a bit in the privacy of your own home is a start.   Getting out to an actual gym/fitness location would be better because it adds the ""getting comfortable in social situations"" to the mix.

Everything, including being a social person who's good at talking to the opposite sex, is a skill that can be learned if you make the effort.

small_havoc,offmychest,1390919111.0,"This broke my heart - my little dog is only 3, but she was diagnosed with lung cancer. She has lived a month longer than she should have already, but she's slowing down. It's just not fair - she's the most loving, affectionate and cleverest ball of fluff I've ever known. We took her in only last year - she loved chasing cattle, she was an ""out doors"" dog and her family couldn't handle her. Couldn't handle what? She just wanted some cuddles, some place warm to sleep. We would leave her outside, scared she would run off into the fields next door, but nope - she was always so good, and would never stray without us. Now she's getting confused and tired, and looks just the way my old 16 year old dog looked last year just before he died. He was the closest thing to a sibling I ever had and it tore me apart to way him coming to the end. I can't believe I have to go through it again with essentially a puppy. But the sadness is selfish - she doesn't *know* she's sick. She is fed everything she loves, cuddle on the couch by the fire every night, and gets to wander around the field a little every day. She has a good life now, and when the discomfort is too much, we will be with her when she goes to sleep. I just wish it wasn't so soon. The average lifespan for her breed is ridiculously old (for dogs), so after my old dog surviving 2 attacks from german shepherds, being knocked down twice (once by the neighbours who owned the fucking untrained german shepherds, who also tore apart an elderly sheepdog), having several operations...

I say *actual* English translations because not everyone is a stickler for that, and it can get confusing. For instance, 99 out of 100 people (in my experience) will tell you that ""seoi nage"" means ""shoulder throw"" but ""seoi"" actually means ""rice carrier.""

GetOffMyLawn_,cfs,1390919386.0,"Very interesting article.

Why the CDC sucks:

&gt; Mistrust and conflict between chronic fatigue syndrome patients and federal health officials has a long history, as Hillary Johnson documented in 1996 in Osler’s Web: Inside the Labyrinth of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Epidemic, a prodigious feat of investigative reporting. When several outbreaks of a persistent, flu-like illness occurred around the U.S. in the mid-1980s, many suspected Epstein-Barr virus as the culprit. The Centers for Disease Control investigated, identified no causal agent, and ultimately saddled the condition with the unfortunate and condescending name — even though the essentially identical illness known as benign myalgic encephalomyelitis (or just myalgic encephalomyelitis) had been identified many years earlier.

&gt; In the late 1990s, the CDC was found to have diverted millions of dollars intended for CFS research into other disease programs, and then to have lied to Congress about it

Yup, I would say PEM is the primary symptom:

&gt; In fact, two-thirds of patients report that their downward slide started with an acute illness, such as mononucleosis or the flu, that never seemed to resolve. And experts and patients agree that the word “fatigue” causes a great deal of misunderstanding among those unfamiliar with the illness. A cardinal symptom, they say, is not just fatigue per se, but what is called post-exertional malaise or post-exertional relapse — the inability of the body to recover rapidly from even small expenditures of energy. Research in recent years has confirmed the presence of this unusual symptom among people with ME/CFS. Moreover, the exhaustion they report is far more severe than the garden-variety tiredness implied by “fatigue.”

Why the IOM sucks:

&gt; In general, medical experts in a particular illness or condition debate and create clinical case definitions and guidelines. But no single medical specialty claims ME/CFS. Patients often see clinicians in a range of specialties, including infectious diseases, immunology, neurology, rheumatology, and psychiatry. The closest parallel to a traditional medical society is the International Association for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, a scientific and advocacy organization of researchers, health care professionals, and others.

&gt; So when the Institute of Medicine announced provisional members of the panel last month, many patients were angry that more than half of the members — whatever their accomplishments in their own fields — were not known to have any professional expertise in ME/CFS. Many clinicians and researchers with experience in the field have already endorsed a set of diagnostic criteria that they say should be used as the starting point for any new case definition.

It's only when I meet a girl who is overly proud about only having male friends, or goes out of the way to make sure that's the case, that I think it can be a red flag. It tends to suggest to me that they either put too much stock in stereotypes, put too much work into being what they think a guy wants rather than being themselves, or think that being 'unique' is more important than being a good person.

Women like that are normally really bad at sex tho. That's why she was like ""NO SEX but lets kiss"". She may be super into affection or trying really hard to stick it to an ex. (Her trying to validate ""likeing nice things to make her feel good"" is justifying exorbitant spending. It could have been a point of conflict in her last relationship. etc.  You get it?). Also, mentioning her salary is her trying too hard to prove her value which is a sign of insecurity.

That means that the sheer quantity of food necessary to get in enough calories is enough to engage the stretch receptors of your stomach, which will cause you to stop wanting to eat because you are too full. So ""unlimited"" fruit is actually quite self-limiting due to the fiber. (This is true of any whole foods plant-based diet though). Most people who eat a fruit-based diet choose to rely on more calorie dense fruits like bananas and dates as their staples precisely for this reason, it can be hard to get in enough calories if you eat only melons or citrus, for example.

If you don't believe me, try eating a 700 calorie meal of bananas, which is about 7 large bananas."

TeaDrinkingBarbarian,starbound,1390919690.0,"&gt; So little reason to do it.... in terms of what, exactly? It's protection from monsters at night, a place to store stuff, and especially useful on multiplayer servers.....

You already spawn in a base where you can do all of this. Your ship.


&gt;if for you, building is not that interesting, then wait until release for sure, because everything ""rpg"" about the game still has yet to be implemented. 

No thanks, I'll keep playing through the actual gameplay content and testing new updates if it's all the same to you.


&gt; Don't hate on the game's most basic function as pointless, tedious, and whatever else you've called it, just because you don't find a ""reason to do it"".

I'm not hating, it's a fact that there are no systems in place for encouraging base building yet. Also, it's not the game's most basic function at all. You could play for hundreds of hours without building anything and miss out on nothing.


&gt;I'm not sure what you want - next you, or someone similarly minded, will be complaining that you have to build a base 

No, I won't. For one, I will never *have* to build a base, because all new characters spawn in one. And secondly because I can enjoy base building **if** there's a point to it, I made some ludicrous shit in Terraria because there were incentives and tools to make doing so both easy and rewarding - Starbound currently does neither of these things."

the amount that normalized immortality would alter the human experience is so tremendous it seems hasty of you to endorse the unfathomable.  every human institution that exists as we know it would change drastically because evolution in every sense would no longer apply to humans.  when you begin to play with the infinite (such as an infinite human lifespan) it becomes difficult to call ideas like better or worse anything but arbitrary in my opinion."

My Ndad used to terrorise the pets, attack them physically (never wound them but send half arsed kicks their way etc), scream at them, not clean up after them, not neuter them. The list goes on.

JustWordsInYourHead,relationships,1390920008.0,"I agree that you and your husband sound like good people, but I do feel that you crossed a line when you allowed your husband to talk to your sister instead of doing it yourself.

I know you feel like you already ""talked"" to her before hand, but think about it from her point of view--you sent her text messages about it but the first actual face-to-face discussion was done by your husband. 

I understand why your sister (and your mother) would be upset about THAT ONE THING. And because you gave them that one thing to fight about, they've now made it their ""cause"" to be angry because it is easier to justify their anger over an actual slight. 

Imagine that you had the same issues with your sister, but instead of her coming to talk to you, you're faced with a virtual stranger (since you and your husband lived abroad, your husband is still ""new"" to your family, no?) confronting you about a private family issue. 

I get that you don't want to reconcile, so you don't have to do a thing about it. And you and your husband are definitely good people.

The simplest thing would probably be to start following the same team as one or more of your good friends, so you have someone you like with whom you can discuss and cheer for the team. But if you don't want to go that route, I'd say identify which players you like or which team plays with a style that you like, and go from there. Then read fan blogs, watch videos, read up on their history, join forums, follow the team online in whatever way you like to educate yourself about them and start to integrate yourself into its community of fans.

GetOffMyLawn_,Fibromyalgia,1390920054.0,"I was lucky (?) to have bought a brand new bed a few months before I got sick. What a difference it makes. I also got new pillows. I got a coil spring mattress with a memory foam pillow top, so no pressure points and my chronic hip pain went away. I also have memory foam pillows. Supportive with no pressure points. Pretty much any and every position is comfortable now.

The choice of bed is a very personal thing. I slept on futons for decades but they're too hard for me now. I thought I would want a memory foam mattress but after extensive in store testing I found I liked the coil spring better. You have to go to a store and lie on the thing for 15 minutes and ask yourself if you're comfortable. If not try another one. Find what's best for YOU."

IWasUpAllNight,Dirtbikes,1390920063.0,"As far azs the fees it should be pretty cheap.  I think my registration is $117 on a 2013 model.  Insurance on dual sport bikes is dirt cheap.  As long as you have a pretty clean record it shouldn't be much.  **GET COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE.** Bikes are too easy to steal and comprehensive covers theft.  The Collision insurance is really up to you, but i don't carry it.  If the bike is older collision wont cover much anyway.  **GET UNINUSURED MOTORIST MEDICAL COVERAGE**. No matter whos in the right or wrong, if a you gets into an accident with a car, you're the one whos fucked (physically).

For gear, the minimum i ride with is a **full face** helmet, riding jacket, gloves, and **over the ankle** boots.  In two accidents I've pretty much landed chin first.  I dont want to think of what i'd look like now if i were were wearing a half or 3/4 helmet.  Style is up to you.  The dirt style helmets look really cool and offer shade for your eyes, goggles, and more breathing room when riding off road, but the visor catches wind and on long high speed (freeway) rides can put a lot of strain on your neck.  They are a lot noisier than street helmets, too.  Make sure your helmet is DOT approved!  You should be able to find one for around $100.  Dont buy a used helmet.  You dont know how hard its been hit.

I ride dirt and street in my street jacket.  Make sure to get a jacket with ""armor"" in the elbows, shoulders and back.  I bought mine for $120 on NewEnough.com on clearance.  You can usually find good deals on jackets.  Used is okay, as long as it doesnt look shredded.

Gloves are important as in most ""offs"" you put your hands out to catch yourself.  Asphalt, hard packed dirt, and sagebrush arent nice to hands.  I got mine in the atv section at walmart for about 10 bucks.  Any leather glove (something that will hold up against asphalt for a minute) will do.  No need to go spend a lot of money on motorcycle specific gloves right away.

Any over the ankle boots will do as long as you arent riding incredibly fast.  The most common injuries in motorcycle crashes are broken wrists and ankles.  Get something that fits snug around your ankle.  Dirt bike boots offer a ton more protection, but really arent practical for commuters.

There are tons of other gear options but these are my suggestions for someone that commutes and is just starting out.  The full face helmet is a must if you value your face and brain.  

I dont know of any off road riding areas that far south, or any groups for trail riding in vegas.  Google is your friend here!  The desert is full of dirt trails.  I know a handful of the guys from Sin City Sportbikes trail ride, although its definately not a dirt bike community.  The have a forum online you can check out and see if there is a dirt section.  Googling Sin City Sportbikes should find it pretty easily.  I'm on mobile, or i'd link to it.

Most importantly take it easy at first and dont head out into the desert alone!  If you crash and get hurt there wont be anyone to get help!

Also dont spend a ton on your first bike.  Chances are you'll wreck it a few times, especially off road.  It has to run good, not look pretty!"

I'm not a jealous guy, but i know that there's a 50/50 chance of getting cheated in a relationship with a straight woman. Theres tons on better guys than me out side, but i kinda accept that because it's natural(not saying you aren't natural).
But if a woman can cheat on me not only with males, but with females too...i just cant compete with a woman for another womans love or attention, really i'm not that attractive, and that for me will be just...terrible. Every person could be a potential enemy.
Of course it depends if you are faithful to the relationship, but still i wouldn't know for sure. And what happens if you get bored, or want to try out some new things (not saying that you don't deserve those things), long-term relations can be really boring.

Had a near-miss with a little girl at the school a few years ago.

Shut up or I'll tell my mom that you touched *her* (pointing to another kid). You look creepy and my mom will believe me.""

When the mother came to pick her up, I took her aside and told her ""Your daughter threatened to make a false claim of sexual abuse against me on the mats today. You need to think very carefully about whether she can continue training here.""

The mother turned red, then purple, then looked like she was going to cry. They never came back, which was probably for the best."

Meanwhile you can choose any carrier. AT&amp;T and Verizon are the top tier ones. Verizon has better coverage but AT&amp;T is faster where you have it. Sprint is just trying to stay alive.

When this happened to me off and on in my life I addressed it head on, however with work it can be a bit trickier. You did the right thing by reporting to HR, and if it continues then continually make a report about it. If you can get physical proof then I would suggest collecting that as well. People have to know that you will not tolerate being harassed. Ignore the people that give you a hard time, and fill your work environment with as much positive motivation as you can. Let people know that you're living a more health conscious life style, ask for diet and exercise tips, and give them when asked. In the office it might be best to flat out ignore all the hate-filled comments and continue to show them that you're happy and will not allow them to bully you.

JustWordsInYourHead,relationships,1390920591.0,"Before you set off any alarms of ""omg controlling guy"", let me help you identify a controlling guy:

A guy is controlling if he says:

- ""Straighten your hair or we will never date again."" 
- ""Wear lighter nail polish colors or we will never date again."" 

Is this guy doing that? No. Instead he is ASKING you to do something. 

- ""Can you straighten your hair? I kind of like it like that."" 
- ""Can you try lighter nail polish colors? I kind of like it like that."" 

**There is a difference between a controlling person and a person who states his preference. Your guy is stating a preference.**

Are you seriously faulting him for speaking his mind? 

-----------

Secondly. You don't have to cater to his preference. He asked you if you can do something. **You can say no.** You make it sound like your choices are either 1) Say Yes, or 2) Say No and Lose the Guy. 

Who told you that if you said NO, he would leave? Did he actually say that? 

Why don't you try this:

""I like the way my hair is and I like this nail color. Is it a deal breaker for you if I don't change it?"" 

If he says ""I really can't accept you like this, sorry."" Then whatever, move on. 

But jesus, don't paint a guy as a controlling person just for stating a preference and **asking if you can meet it.** 

Remember, he's ASKING, not TELLING. "

You obviously have no idea what you're talking about. And you have the audacity to call my logic ridiculous? 

&gt;The reason you don't have any legal recourse is because you would sue the horse owner out of business, not because the horse is doing something instinctual or natural. 

As if the law ever cared about business owners. It's because you can't control every action of an animal and people can't be held responsible for the actions of their animals when other people come around them. For the same reason if someone comes on your property and your dog bites them they can't do anything, but if your dog goes onto theirs and bites them they can insist it be destroyed.

It boils down to if you go looking for trouble and find it you're at fault and should accept the misfortune that finds you.

incogito_ergo,RealEstate,1390920761.0,"Sure! For the purpose of this example there are 3 relevant types of loans

1) conventional. This is what anyone would get with a major bank/lender. These are almost always underwritten to Fannie Mae standards so they can be quickly resold nowadays. That means strict credit limits, debt to income, and loan to value ratios (FNMA LTVs are 75% for your first 4 properties and 70% for 6-10. You can do 11-20 at 70 as well but they have to be Fannie Mae homepath properties, which are generally not good deals). 

2) hard money. These are loans from private lenders looking for high risk/return. You will pay 3-4 points plus somewhere from 7-16% interest (they are usually interest only loans with a 6 month balloon). There is a lot more variability in loan products here than anywhere else. Regardless, hard money is expensive. The main benefit is that you can get loans on ""uninhabitable"" houses that conventional lenders won't lend on (uninhabitable can mean anything from no working AC to a couple of broken windows to a missing roof, massive foundation and plumbing problems, etc. ). You can also finance repair costs, and acquire property with minimal out of pocket. Due to the nature of these loans, your goal is to get out of hard money ASAP, which means getting the rehab finished and getting an executed lease. You then refinance to either conventional, or a portfolio loan 

3) portfolio. Unlike conventional loans, these are not underwritten with the intention to resell. They are normally written by smaller/local banks who intend to hold the note for a profit. There are a lot of advantages to portfolio loans. You aren't limited to 10 like FNMA. Your lender will probably be more flexible on LTV and other terms. Closing costs may be lower, and time to close may be faster. You also don't have to wait 6 months to do a cash out refi (with conventional loans you can only change rate and terms for the first 6 months, not pull cash out). Disadvantage is you can't just walk into a bank and get one typically. Having an account or bonds at a bank help, or being able to network. They also will care a lot more about your finances (will want to see entire tax returns etc. ). OTOH, if you have a good income and great credit, these can be really attractive (FWIW there are also hard money lenders that only work with high income/credit score people, and offer better terms than mentioned above). 

Hope that helps!"

grillkohle,AskReddit,1390920808.0,"Hello,  
I handled the introduction of new students to our university for 2 years, here are some advices I give them (that helped me):  
- Most universities have some kind of introduction program to tell you what you need to know about university and to introduce you to your fellow students. Attend as many of those programs as possible. For both reasons. For us, many of these programs are organized via Facebook groups, but there should be mechanisms that make sure you get into it.  
- Don't be afraid to talk to your fellow students. In the beginning, before everyone starts grouping and getting used to certain people, most students are in exactly the same situation like you. Think about this fact, and just try to find people that you are comfortable having around with. You might not find these people during your first encounter, but that is okay. However, I had to learn that people are different to the people I was used to and I had to accept that to a certain degree. I also contacted some folks that were in the ""first semester university X year Y"" group and asked them to meet before the first lecture and I got lucky to meet the right people (also social media pages might tell you something about them).  
- Universities tend to have a broad offer in extra-scholar activities, like we have a large sports centre with all the different (and some quite unusual) types of sport (underwater rugby...) or groups interested in debating and stuff like that. Maybe you have something you like or you want to try, and you can find mates there. Especially untypical types of sport are an option, because I for example can't play football and I would be too embarrassed to enter a football group because I don't want to fail, but nobody is expected to be an expert in underwater rugby. For some sports clubs there are signs as to what degree you should know it, like beginner, advanced and professional or something like that.      
- Personally, I did not waste one second to think about my situation. I guess I would have been scared as well, but I just did not think about it. I often refer to my first semester as floating with the current. I just did what you are supposed to do (attending or not attending lectures, participating in the introduction program, went to the big university parties and did some stuff with my new found collegues) and it worked out quite well. The time went by like nothing and the first time I thought about my move to university and how everything went it was in the second semester and I was really surprised. I did exactly the same when I went for a semester abroad. However, I realize that this can be difficult for other persons depending on their personality.    
Obviously I am speaking from my perspective (it was a university with 12k students in Germany) and it can be different somewhere else, but I hope some of this is helpful. "

Lesbian_Drummer,sex,1390921273.0,"My wife doesn't get to see my porn.  She's asked once or twice, and I've said ""Nope!""  And I'm not allowed to see hers, either.  It's just... the one place we don't get to go inside each other's heads.  I'll describe some of the things I look at, and vice versa, but with the extremely important disclaimer that what I'm looking at is hot, but not necessarily something I want to personally try.  For instance, I really like BDSM porn, and voyeuristic porn.  Does that mean I want someone to tie me up and let fifteen men and women fuck my brains out?  Not actually.  But it's hot to watch.

I think she's probably feeling insecure.  This is a whole world she knows nothing about, because she doesn't watch it and she doesn't masturbate.  I would recommend she introduce her*self* to porn, rather than get an introduction through your own stash.  You could guide her - tell her an actor or actress she might like, give her search parameters to keep from the more extreme stuff (like ""romantic"").  But discovering porn is kind of personal.  You need to know no one's watching you as you figure out what you do and don't like.

It might also help her understand that you watching porn and masturbating has nothing to do with *her*.  This is an opinion women often seem to have, that they should be enough for their man.  And it's complicated for them to understand that *my* masturbation actually has *nothing* to do with my partner and everything to do with me.  If it's not interfering with my sex life with my wife (except for maybe the occasional, ""Oh, man! I took care of myself earlier while you were gone because I thought sex was off the table tonight!  I'm sorry, baby!"") then there's no reason for concern."

I would start by explicitly saying that you're feeling a friend vibe, not a love interest vibe and get it out in the open that either she feels that way too, or she's like a glacially slow mover on the intimacy front.
i.e. this is the moment she needs to either club you over the head to make you realize she has wanted you to kiss her for 2 months, or you are just being courteous to let her know you're looking at dating possibilities again.

Bryan gave an interview before the rumble that the COO (HHH's kayfabe position) didn't want him in the match and wanted to keep him out of the title picture. 99% of fans pretty much ignored this, but continued to expect Daniel Bryan to be in the rumble. Then, when he wasn't in the rumble, despite Bryan telling us himself that he wasn't in the rumble on top of being beat to shit by Bray Wyatt, we turned into a bunch of bratty, petulant children like it was Christmas day and we didn't get the bicycle we wanted.

It was also a good track of how much I excreted through urine, feces, and sweat.  If I ate high dense food and didn't visit the porcelain receptacle today, the scale jumped.

It is useless, the data is dirty as the environment is wild...

Pick a condition you can repeat.  As an example: first waking up out of bed; urinate, no intake (food and water) for 8/9/10 hours, naked.  Use this to weigh yourself.  Make sure you place the scale on the same spot of the floor every time as well.  Now track the ups and downs on an AVERAGE scale OVER TIME.  As in, weekly averages over a month... not every day.

As you adapt your electrolytes and water intake/excretion (sweat, urine, feces, tears, blood, etc.) you will notice smaller ""swings"" from day to day, but they will still exist.  Your calories and macros may allow for a nice sizable pasta dinner, which will, over time, balance out to not put on weight: but the scale the next morning will ""jump up"" because of the density of the food you consumed and it takes 36-72 hours to break it all down and rid yourself of it.  This is NOT weight gain, it is a fluctuation inside of a cycle that WILL SKEW perception.  Stomach contents are included on the scale, but may not stay with you much longer!

Weighing yourself once per week (ensuring like conditions as much as possible) and MEASURING body parts every 1-2 weeks is a recomended indicator of progression (up or down).  As a male, measure neck, chest (close to arm pits, across the nipples), belly (come across at the belly button), hips (right across the pelvic flap, just above the penis), biceps (where thickest), forearms (where thickest), thighs (top part, where thickest), and calves (where thickest).  I believe females measure different for their hips and thighs, but should not follow the ""thinnest part for waist"" that is applicable to clothes fittings (come across the belly button every time for THIS measurement).

By taking both body size and body weight measurements, you will track shifts that may not be pleasing on one scale, but are great on the other.  For example on a cut: gain .5 lbs on average over the last month, but grew biceps and dropped belly size.  Celebrate?  YOU BET!  That isn't a plateau..."

While I'll agree that the assignment structure is a little boring, I also agree with the guy teaching it that being able to teach something on your own absolutely aides your knowledge of it. I'm not sure what would have been better for a MOOC. Certainly he can't grade thousands of projects on his own, and the multiple guess questions aren't going to be good beyond the conceptual stage.

What bugs me is the couple of times that I had work reviewed by people who completely missed the scope of the assignment - had *no idea* what they were supposed to do, and so had no idea how to review others' videos. For example, the guidelines were to have a maximum video length of five minutes. A guy dinged me because I was within the guideline - he thought it was supposed to be more. Killed my motivation and I stopped the course.

tearr,Bitcoin,1390921480.0,"That is **not** one of the main arguements for bitcoin. You can send bitcoin freely for low or no fees. You can't buy bitcoin from some company and expect them to do it for you for free. 

Also Safello very clearly lists their buy and sell prices, so why you're sad that the company did exactly what they said they would do is beyond me. If you went into bitcoin to make money (which it seems like you did), you should spend 5 minutes to check the fees. Probably trade bitcoins instead of buying from a third party.

You didn't even use bitcoin (as you said in your title), you bought and sold bitcoin. If you buy a hamburger for 5 dollars and sell it for 10 later have you used the hamburger?"

It will reduce infanticide substantially to rid China (and also India) of these archaic laws that violate our human rights.

Educate them is the most important thing, and don't have these laws in place. Simply having that law there is the world saying that we can control and manipulate a woman's reproduction to our liking.

If the fuel is sucked out into space along with the oxygen, then the density of both will diffuse as there is no longer any pressure to keep them together, and the reaction will stop.

Thinking back on it, I feel like we were very much terrorized in our own home. Every night there would be yelling from my mom. She kept saying things about how we were all useless and how she was cursed with the worst children in the world. If we happened to do something ""out of line"", we get hit. 

Things I got several slaps across the face for:

- Peeling an orange instead of cutting it. It reminded her of my father (he never cut oranges, peeled them instead). 

- Wearing my sneakers like slippers and not pushing my heel all the way in. This one was a whopper of a beating. She slapped me so hard that I fell on the floor. Ugh. 

These two were the most ""ridiculous"" situations I can think of getting hit for.

When she was arrested for my brother's bleeding face... he had burnt a pot on the stove. 

A lot of W.T.F moments with my mom. It's been 5 years since that FINAL incident though and it honestly just feels like a dark period of my life that's passed now.

It's about putting the effort in.  While it may have struck a chord with you, it could be because you don't think about what she likes until it nears a holiday. I'm just being honest, being with someone who is always clueless on what to get you sucks.  It's the thought that counts, and if the thought is ""Christmas is in 3 weeks it's time to figure out what you like/what you're interested in"" that does suck.


I like a man who will put in a lot of effort for me, because I sure as hell do it.   Even when we were broke and gift budgets were maxed at $15 he still blew me away because his gifts showed me he knew me.  Now that our gift budgets are larger we'll definitely point each other in the right direction, especially for electronics or what have you, but there's still always something little and personal thrown in that I have no clue about, and I love it."

It makes it much easier for human trafficking and slavers. I know it seams counter intuitive, but listen to it this way.

Theres illegal workers on building sites, guys with fake degrees and un-vetted references constructing bridges. The workforce is diverse and messy and hard to police.        
A hooker here could have a bound and gagged family at gun point in some other country. Just because she applied for a work permit or is paying tax won't change this.       
It will change how easy it is to tackle the human traffickers though, meaning that the entire case will lie only in witness testimony and will require international co-op of multiple agencies and maybe extradition.
This is a hassle and one that will cause more suffering. Its a complex issue with pros and cons for both sides, but both sides think there side is bullet proof.

nattoninja,science,1390922086.0,"Certainly if you suddenly add an extra 700 calories daily to your diet you'll gain weight. What I'm specifically arguing is that if you add that 700 calories in the form of whole fruit, you will have a difficult time getting in the rest of your normal meals because of the sheer bulk from the fiber. Not that it's impossible to eat calories in excess of needs when eating a lot of fruit, just that it's more difficult, certainly not as easy as eating an extra 700 calories from something calorie dense like fatty meat or rich desserts.

Also, again, it's not difficult for vegans in general to get in enough calories. Not sure where you got that idea, but a vegan diet isn't necessarily low calorie nor particularly healthy just by virtue of cutting out animal foods. There are plenty of high calorie junk foods that are vegan as I mentioned earlier. However, if you subsist solely on raw unprocessed foods, this does become a concern, as the volume of the food necessary to consume adequate calories is much higher than most people are accustomed to eating.

I brought up the banana based diet to counter your claim that bananas in large amounts are unhealthy by showing that people who eat a large amount of fruit on a daily basis are in fact quite healthy. Fruit is very healthy for humans to eat in large amounts. Period.

My_name_isOzymandias,explainlikeimfive,1390922266.0,"My gut says it comes down to power. In a murder where a teen is likely to be tried so an adult, there is no question that the murder is in a position of power over the victim, regardless of their age. However,  for sex,  an act that should have the  consent of both parties, the adult is in a position of power over the teen. Adults are authority figures for teens, they may also be physically stronger than the teen. So, consent is a very tricky thing, &amp; one of the things that makes it harder if not impossible to establish is if one person has power over the other. A women with a knife to her throat might tell the man holding the knife that she wants to have sex,  but that isn't consent because she is fearing for her life and choosing the lesser of 2 bad options. 

Now, I'm not saying it's impossible for a teen to say no to sex with an authority figure, it's just much more difficult, because saying no to an authority figure often has negative consequences.

Again, that presupposes an incredible level of bias and in-group preference. A source providing some evidence for your claims would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;No, it doesn't. The preference for males over females need not derive from overt tribalism (""she's not like us""). It can manifest in other types of reasoning: ""her menstrual cycle probably makes her irrational, so surely she can't be president;"" ""she needs to be executed if another man eyes her, because our religious texts [authored incidentally by men] say so;"" ""there's no need for her to vote, because her interests must be the same as her husband's."" These are real rationales that have been (and in some cases continue to be) influential in maintaining a patriarchal social structure.

I'm not seeing where tribalism is inadequate to cover these points. It boils down to ""they're not like us"" and all the traits you mentioned are simply means of differentiating groups.

&gt;I haven't noted this, but would appreciate a source substantiating it if you have one. And even if the average woman, on a scale of 1-10, displayed ingroup preference at a level 6 and the average man at level 4, the fact that all of society's positions of power have traditionally been held by men (men are the gatekeepers to these systems) means womens' discriminatory tendencies are all but irrelevant -- they aren't in a position to do the discriminating. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15491274

I'd argue that implicit bias among women is far more prevalent and influential than you think it is. Women dominate at most levels of the most powerful gatekeeper of them all: the educational system.

Even if what you say is true, the effects of this bias will only become stronger as they attain parity with men in high-level political and executive positions. "

YOUR_VERY_STUPID,asoiaf,1390922407.0,"&gt;Do you like Jaime Lannister? Why or why not?

&gt;Was Jaime morally justified in killing Aerys II?

I absolutely like Jaime. He's one of the most interesting characters in my opinion. He's been faced with some of the most difficult decisions in the series- from killing Aerys to shoving Bran out the window. I think Jaime faces a backlash from situations where there is no good option. He tries to make the correct choice, but ethical philosophy isn't really studied much in Westeros. Regicide or genocide?

Jaime is bitter because he's constantly judged by people who don't know him. His whole life has been shaped by expectations and judgments. He's the scion of Lannister and from birth was expected to become a great knight. When he does become a great knight, he ends up stabbing Aerys and all those expectations change. Everyone sees him as a dangerous man with no honor, and he gets respect in the same way The Mountain does- ""please don't kill me because i know you wouldn't even feel bad about it.""

&gt;While many see Jaime's arc as a redemption arc or humanization arc in ASOS and onwards, Jaime does threaten to throw Edmure Tully's unborn child over the walls of Riverrun during the siege in AFFC. Was this an idle threat or is this evidence that Jaime hasn't really changed much from the man who pushed Bran out of a window?

I don't think he would have followed through with it if it came to that. Jaime Goldenhand is *based* on bluffs. When he had his hand, everyone was scared of him because of his reputation. He's trying to hang onto that reputation, because it's the only thing saving him from everyone who hates him. Jaime lost his strength and his pride, and he was never clever like Tywin or Tyrion. He's reforming and trying to figure out his new role in life.

&gt;I recall a comment here on this subreddit (but can't find it) that twincest is the very definition of egocentrism. Do you believe that Jaime's incestuous relationship with his sister is egocentric?

Without the post, I don't really see any reason to accept this argument. I assume the gist is ""I love myself so much that i want to fuck myself and a twin is basically me."" I don't agree with that- perhaps for Cersei, who is a clear narcissist, but not for Jaime. Jaime just loved his sister.

&gt;What's your interpretation of Jaime's fever dream in ASOS, Jaime VI?

I don't remember it and had to go read the one paragraph summary linked. I think it's a metaphor for the Bear and Maiden Fair representation of Brienne and Jaime, respectively. She's his protector, one of the only people who ever judged him honestly. It made him realize that he did actually care about Brienne, despite her original disdain for him. He doesn't want to lose his friend.

&gt;Does Jaime have romantic affections for Brienne?

not until he drinks that Braavosi milk

&gt;Will Jaime survive his encounter with Lady Stoneheart? If so, how? If not, how will he go out?

I can't really take a position on this- I don't like baseless speculation. I feel like GRRM wouldn't be so cruel as to give us a completely anticlimatic Jaime death. His character is changing in such an interesting way, and in the past, the characters with pointless ""oh shit you're dead now"" deaths have usually had little-to-no character development, like, say, Quentyn, Catelyn, and Robb.

&gt;Will Jaime fulfill the valonqar prophecy to Cersei?

Again, I don't like baseless speculation, but I don't think so, though it may just be wishful thinking. I want Tyrion to kill her, Tyrion wants Tyrion to kill her, and Jaime just wants her to stop being such a *bitch*.

&gt;Jaime's character arc seems to typify Martin's comment that ""the human heart in conflict with itself is the only thing worth writing about."" From his choice of the Kingsguard over Casterly Rock, doing the 'right thing' over his vows as a White Cloak in the case of Aerys II, his Kingsguard vows over his father (again) and sister to saving Brienne, Jaime seems to be in constant conflict with himself. How do you think this will manifest itself in future books?

Baseless speculation again, but it would be nice if he became renowned as a judge. Trials in Westeros are obviously super bullshit, they could use a Supreme Justice or something. It would fit in with his history of tough decisions, and Jaime has been trying to overcome his reputation as Kingslayer for the past 20 years."

GetOffMyLawn_,Hypothyroidism,1390922501.0,"I have lots of food allergies, including milk, plus I don't like fat and I am not big on animal products. So a lot of these special diets are just not for me, too restrictive on top of the restrictions I already have to deal with. I try to follow a balanced eating plan. Carbs are okay in moderation. I find 4 servings a day are plenty for me, which is less than the recommended amount. Eat whole grains and avoid the white stuff. So oatmeal at breakfast is fine. Have some soy yogurt or turkey slices with it. Quinoa is a high protein grain and easy to cook.  There are lots of vegan protein powders out there that don't use whey or egg whites. Mix them into a smoothie. You can scramble tofu for breakfast instead of eggs. Add some turmeric to make it yellow, add chopped onions and peppers for flavor. Add some salsa.

Some people recommend a low GI diet since that helps you feel less hungry. Go for protein and vegetables mostly.

Smith really is forming into a decent big man, and Pitchford isn't short, but we don't have someone who can distribute the ball and avoid turnovers.

Biggs was turnover prone especially in his last 2 games with 10 turnovers, and the two biggest turnovers against Penn State, which gave them the lead and then took away any chance we had at answering.

I should say that Biggs was starting to show some ability. He was never going to be an all-time great, he played too much like a freshman as a junior. He did show glimmers, and I think he could have figured out his turnover issue (don't dribble into and through double teams)."

JustWordsInYourHead,relationships,1390922752.0,"We are! Her arrest was 5 years ago. Because my father lived in a different country (he stayed back in China), I ended up dealing with the entire mess. Had to deal with lawyers, take my mom to court, the whole shebang. 

Because it was a first offense and because her defense lawyer convinced my little brother to ask the prosecutor to go easy, my mom got one year probation (couldn't leave the country) and she had mandatory counseling one day a week for that entire year. She had to report to the probation officer every time she went in for counselling. 

For 3 months before her arraignment, she and my brother were not allowed to be alone together. The police made me sign a document saying that my mother would only be released into my custody. So in effect, if my mother and my brother were found alone together without me present, then I would be partially liable as well. It was between that or having my mom sit in jail for that entire time....... and I honestly couldn't stomach the thought of leaving my mom in jail.

So my brother ended up staying with me because I couldn't be at their house all the time. It was difficult as I was working and going to school at the same time, so I was managing my little brother's schedule as well as dealing with the court mess and my mom. 

Five years later, my brother still lives with my mom while he finishes university, except she's only ever there for 3 months out of a year. The year of counselling seems to have helped her as well. She's finally come to accept that it's not okay to use violence to express her feelings. 

When she IS there at the house, my brother goes to stay with his girlfriend on campus. When she's not there, he enjoys having the entire house to himself. He's communicated to me that once he gets a real job and starts his own adult life, he's done with her forever. He never wants to see her or speak to her ever again. He's only staying with her because my father provides for him (education, food) through her. 

I'm personally dealing with some emotional and mental residues of having such a mother. I realise that I don't react ""properly"" to things sometimes. For example, I don't voice my opinions and objections as much as I should because I'm used to avoiding violent confrontations. I end up internalizing and repressing a lot of my own feelings until they fester. Things like that make it close personal relationships hard to manage, but thankfully I'm with a person who understands all of this and is patient with me. 

I'm very very dedicated to making sure that I am well adjusted. My close friends and my partner are all astonished at how I am not ""as fucked up"" as some people would be in the same situation, but I feel like if I DON'T take personal responsibility to be well adjusted, I can never have children--simply because I feel my children would deserve the best of me.

The Elven King, AKA Thranduil was originally named Thingol according to *The History of the Hobbit*, and his halls are quite similar to the description we get of Menegroth later on. While this is later justified with Thranduil being a former resident of Doriath, the fact remains that the original inspiration was an adapted form of the older story.

mdkss12,politics,1390922826.0,"as far as the identifying part:

it's because pro-life ""won"" the branding battle between the 2.

like any pro-choice person will tell you, no one is ""pro-abortion"" but the problem is, each side got to frame the debate around their own phrases.

everyone is pro-life (not in the political sense, but in the human sense), so being branded as Pro-life means that your opponents must be anti-life. it has a very real immediate meaning to people when you say ""life"".

on the other hand, choice seems to be a far less concrete feeling thing to support. uninformed people just assume it means that choice=abortion, and not the *option* to have an abortion.

pro-life has always struck me as a very organized, well run movement which has blurred its message so that more people will self-identify as ""Pro-life"" despite not really knowing what that actually entails (i was among them, i went to a fairly liberal catholic school and abortion was discussed in the framework of personal views on abortion, not as the greater political movement. as a result, people who would personally not get one, but thought others should be free to, believed they were classified as pro-life)

in most organizations this would be seen as diluting the brand, but in politics it's different. i think that's exactly what the pro-life movement wants. if people dont actually know what the movement is trying to do, but associate with it anyway they appear to have a larger (and thus more influential) base to point to when they approach politicians. [hell, they could use this poll](http://www.gallup.com/poll/154838/pro-choice-americans-record-low.aspx), and only point to the portions that say that more people identify as prolife and find abortion morally wrong, and ignore that a majority think it should be legal and accessible.

to me this has been in stark contrast to what has always seemed a more disjointed, decentralized movement that is Pro-choice. 

it's just very frustrating, there are too many people who think govt should stay out of their lives, but not the lives of everyone else. i just hope that these repressed assholes die off and that enough of their kids manage to realize that they were spewing bullshit so that we can move on to actual important issues. (not that women's rights, lgbt rights, etc aren't important, i just mean that *they shouldnt be up for debate in the first place!*)"

Whenever he's in town,  we hang out, and if we drink, he crashes here. On the couch. And nothing ever happens.

You have to look at it this way. 1. He's an ex for a reason. At least in my situation, he could get rich,  gorgeous,  and buy me a house. Wouldn't change our past and wouldn't make me want to date him again.  But you also have to keep in mind 2. If it was a long relationship,  then obviously she liked him (and I'm talking liked as in, was his friend, enjoyed his company,  made each other laugh). And it's hard to get rid of those feelings too.

Long story short, just because someone loses a person as a boyfriend,  doesn't mean she doesn't want to keep him as a friend.

Theungry,changemyview,1390923100.0,"&gt;In terms of promiscuity, I've never heard a male friend (I'm also male) ever complain about or deride a woman for being promiscuous.

You're on reddit.  You can see pretty quickly [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/search?q=too+many+partners&amp;restrict_sr=on) by looking at some of the comments how many guys would not seriously consider dating a woman with more than a small handful of sexual partners.

Edit -  a Collection of highly rated comments from the top three search results:

&gt; For me it's less about the number and more about the type of sex that she has, with women who have casual sex with strangers being less appealing for anything serious.


&gt;to be honest if she tells me, it could be a problem. I can't quite decide my cut-off at this point in my life, but I know for sure 8 seems like the sky for me.


&gt;If she's had a lot of sex partners because she likes sex, that's great if I want sex or a physical connection and not an LTR. Not so great if I want an LTR as it's suddenly less likely that our goals are compatible with each other.


&gt;I'll be honest, I really would not want someone like you (""slept with 10-15 guys"") to be the mother of my children.


&gt;In the end, you've gotta pick what you want and realise that for some people, a promiscuos past is a dealbreaker.

Clockw0rk,ffxiv,1390923275.0,"I've played female characters in games for quite a while. Ultimately, it boils down to what I feel is appropriate for the role. Here's a list of characters I've played and why.

Dragon Age: Male Knight archetype. Having seen some of the art assets before playing the game, I decided that a melee fighter seemed most interesting and the armor lends itself better to a male character.

Diablo 3: Female demon hunter. When it comes to Diablo-esq games, I tend to prefer range and mobility, so the demon hunter was a natural choice. Blame pop culture, but I have it branded into my brain that archers are typically female so that's what I went with.

Mass Effect: Male engineer archetype. Again, blame pop culture, but there's not a whole lot of positive female engineer role models. If I'm going to save the universe in an experimental space ship, I want my character to be versatile in tech, tactics and weapon/armor choices.

World of Warcraft: Female blood elf rogue. The benefits of playing a rogue are pretty outstanding for the solo player, particularly the ability to drop out of combat or sneak around enemies to avoid tough obstacles. When I think assassin, I think quiet, sleek and graceful. Athletic. And those are traits I attribute to females by default. At the time I made my return to WoW, my friends were all on Horde, and Blood Elves were the most attractive female models, so that cemented that choice.

Guild Wars 2: Female Sylvari Ranger. Again, archer = female in my brain, so easy choice there. Race choice boiled down to the most attractive female.

The Secret World: This one is a toughie. No true classes, only humans for the races, 'armor' is effectively invisible stat boosts and cosmetic outfits. I decide I want to do a caster archetype, so I choose female. Again, call it pop culture bias, but female casters seem like they're more 'at one with' magic rather than just controlling and purposing it.

FFXIV: Female Elezen arcanist. Following the previous reasoning, first choice for caster is female. Casters should also look dignified and 'studied', so Elezen is the best fit.

**In summary:** Largely due to societal and pop culture bias, my default preferences are that soldier or warrior archetype characters that are close quarters/melee should be male. Deviations from this are typically when you're given the choice of an 'amazon' female, who is decidedly taller and more muscular than the average female.

Likewise, casters and archers just seem like they should be female. The exception from the rule is if there's a male only race that seems to fit with a particular magic archetype (like stone golemns for druid magic), or necromancy (dark magic works great with gaunt males).

When I customize my characters, I prefer to make them look dignified or 'bold'. This often lends to larger framed models for both male and female characters. However, if a male character doesn't look sufficiently bold after tweaking it a bit and exploring different armor looks, I'll defer to beautiful and go with the most attractive female I can make. The culture influence on this is neither here nor there, but hollywood has certainly done a good job of making ""the hero"" be attractive whether male or female. So naturally, I try to make my characters as attractive as they can be, fitting their class."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390923304.0,"&gt; The only difference that would occur if I suddenly became bisexual was if I wished to engage in physical intimacy with these close friends.

If this were true for you it would mean that you can have no friendships with women, because there is a potential for sex, because they have the correct genitals. I really don't see how this can be true. Surely there are women you know that you have no interest in sexually despite the fact that they are women. Really old women, really really young women, women who are physically just not your type, etc.

Or surely there must women that you can objectively say are physically attractive, yet don't feel personal attraction to them?

People do not go about engaging in sex with every single person of the right gender of their orientation who they can see is attractive. Plenty of people have friendships with other people of whatever gender they are attracted to. It is not that they are always resisting the urge to have sex. It is that the urge is not there, despite the person's body.

&gt; Acting on bisexuality, according to my argument, is hedonistic. Simply being attracted to both genders without action is a kink.

If you want to say that this is true, than it is still no different from acting on sexual attraction in general. A man being attracted to woman is different from engaging in sex with her. Same for a woman being attracted to man. If you want to say that engaging is sex is hedonistic, then that is an altogether different point. This has nothing to do with being bisexual, it would affect people of all orientations equally.

I really think the argument you are making is that sexual acts are hedonistic, (potentially both inside and outside of a relationship?). And I think you believe bisexuals have to be more hedonistic because you think they have twice population to chose from.

Or maybe you simply believe it is not possible for people to be friends where there is even the slightest possibility of sexual attraction, so you don't see how bisexuals can have any friends, and you think they have only sexual partners?"

Also is true for the bumblebee. Aerodynamics majors will argue it's impossible for them to fly. Yet their size relative to the size of the particles in the air allows them. Meaning to them the air is thicker since they're so small. Yet a common mistake is to compare them to the air density relative to our size--big mistake.

ThirdWaveSTEMinism,learnmath,1390923417.0,"Interval notation is pretty simple. An interval is essentially a set of real numbers that are between two other real numbers. We represent one in interval notation with two numbers enclosed in either parentheses or square brackets. A paren denotes that the number it's next to is *not* included in the set, and a square bracket denotes that the number *is* included in the set. 

For example, (a, b) is the set of all numbers between a and b, excluding both a and b. This is called an open interval. [a, b], on the other hand, includes both a and b and is called a closed interval. An interval can also be open on either endpoint and closed on the other.

Set notation is slightly more complicated but it's not too difficult. The open interval (a, b) can be represented with the following set notation:

[; \{ x \in \mathds{R} | a &lt; x &lt; b \} ;]

The whole thing is supposed to be enclosed in curly brackets but LaTeX apparently can't render them here. There's some symbols I'm guessing you haven't seen so I'll explain those. In set notation the e-shaped symbol means ""is an element of"" and the vertical bar means ""such that"". And hopefully you already know R denotes the real numbers. So in English the above notation can be read as ""the set of all real numbers x such that a is less than x and x is less than b.""

Hopefully that was helpful. Also if you're into programming, then Haskell and Python both have a construct called comprehensions which are useful for learning set notation."

IntellegentIdiot,loseit,1390923504.0,"If it were me, I'd go with the bodyweight approach. Bodyweight exercises are great, you can do them anywhere and you don't need special equipment

My suggestion would be to start with a challenge. Ask your students to do something physical, maybe hold a plank for as long as they can, then give them a rest and challenge them to beat their old score. People usually underestimate their abilities first time around and quit but realise they could have pushed themselves a bit harder. On the second try they know what to expect and give more. It's a useful lesson about how our minds play tricks on us as well as demonstrating how important a warm up is to performance.

One thing I would have really loved is to have progression tracking in something like this. Measure their results in various exercises, the number of push-ups, the time to run a lap of the track, etc. and project their progress over the year. If you start off doing 2 push-ups and see a projection that has you doing 25 push-ups by the end of the year you're going to have a hard time believing that's possible but as the weeks pass and as you progress you start to think that maybe you were wrong. Many adults don't start something because they don't think it's possible to do but perhaps if they had learnt that with time and effort almost anything was possible they would be more willing to improve themselves.

I'm against gay marriage because I believe women should be defended and protected and one way to protect women is through marriage.

uh, you lost me.

ok, so he is what i am getting from your question. a misogynist marries a man. so, assuming that the misogynist is a gay man, he is marrying another man. why does he ""use"" a woman as a prostitute? hmm. doesn't make sense.

ok, let's try this: the misogynist is a man but not gay but he marries another man for some reason, then has sex with prostitutes? why is he marrying another man then? again, doesn't make sense.

hmm. ok, try number three: the misogynist is a woman... no, then it wouldn't matter about gay marriage, because she can already marry a man.

i don't understand what two men marrying has to do with women in prostitution. if you feel that prostitution is wrong or that only misogynists use prostitutes, that has nothing to do with two men (or two women) who are in love and want to be married.

also, the phrase ""I believe women should be defended and protected and one way to protect women is through marriage"" doesn't really make sense, because what is to stop a misogynist from marrying a woman and abusing her? or forcing her into prostitution? or anything else? i don't understand how marriage ""protects women""."

Looks like you're in Louisville. I don't know KY law, so I suggest that you call up the local breweries and wineries. Ask to speak to the owner or manager on duty, or to have said people call you back. Ask each one if they'll tell you what legal counsel they use for the business, as a recommendation to you as someone exploring the idea of entering the industry - because believe me they probably have legal counsel.

At least a few of them probably use firms that *specialize* in winery, brewery, and distillery compliance issues. Pick a firm makes you feel comfortable, and schedule a one-hour appointment by phone or in person. Tell the receptionist who schedules your appointment that you'd like to work out what it takes to start a winery that produces mead in KY, and that you're exploring options but don't know the legal side. If the firm can't give you a solid overview in one hour for a reasonable price, you picked the wrong firm. (In VA a reasonable price is $200 or less for one hour with a specialist lawyer. KY may be more expensive, considering some of the distilleries out there who can pony up big time.)

Pay for counsel if you're serious. I believe it will save anyone time and money in the long run. US alcohol laws are just too complicated to try to work out on your own, and sometimes there are market or industry realities that someone immersed in the business can warn you about (like an impending legislative change, or market saturation), which you would never otherwise see before it's too late.

I think I differ with Krin a little bit when I say this - talking to the local government office can be a complete waste of time. Sure, in some ways they are necessary and helpful, but I've found that the people at City Hall or equivalent often don't know what they're talking about if they're unfamiliar with the industry, but will certainly spout bullshit all day long."

dan4daniel,politics,1390924182.0,"I suppose I was insufficiently clear.

Consider this, if the State had instead required that all guns be made of an expensive material, let's say gold, that is both expensive and unsuitable for use in firearms then they are making it impossible for most of their citizens to own guns. This law operates in that vein, it artificially drives the price of firearms up by requiring extraneous technology which is in fact unproven, the study states that under normal firing conditions the stamps often fail to leave readable marks. So, I believe that in this case the state of California is infringing on its citizens ability to bear arms.

This **highly** depends on what you want to see and your financial situation. 

If you want to go during festival season (Taste of Tasmania, small local fairs, Falls Music Festival ect.) go during summer (December - February). This 3 month period is also the peak holiday season so prices won't generally be as cheap as they can be. 

Autumn (March - May) is the best time to sample fresh Tasmanian produce(Taste of the Huon, Agfest) and see Targa Tasmania 

Winter(June - August) there isn't much on except for the Chocolate Winterfest. During winter, it is the cheapest time to travel and the tourist crowds are smaller.I wouldn't personally suggest anyone to go during winter unless you can cope in cold weather. 

Spring (September - November) is probably your best pick in terms of the weather. During spring their is also many tulip festivals around the state. 


 
But overall, most tourists generally go between November and March.

* The really old players have maxed skills for tons of different ships. To max out your skills for a nice cruiser or something won't take years.

I'm surprised to see that the top 21 are state schools.  I guess both our preconceived ideas about *that* went up in smoke huh?  We'll pretend they're state schools in relatively affluent areas because I certainly do agree that socio-economic variables of the student body are more important than whether a school is coed or not.

Anyway.  The top school there is a coed.  So that makes me wrong I guess.  Number 2,3,4 are girls schools though.

lalicat,WTF,1390924291.0,"I saw an insurgent take frag from a grenade to the face and keep shooting for another 5 minutes (at least). 

We all just kinda sat there waiting for him to die but he wouldn't so we decided instead of risking Marines by trying to assault his position we'd let him realize he was dead first. It was weird because he kept shooting like nothing happened, then ducked down and would pop up and keep shooting like he wasn't missing half his face. Like it didn't even occur to him. Then suddenly he started screaming loudly in agony and kept whaling really creepily (his vocal cords were intact but his tongue and most of his upper/lower jaw were completely shredded). So he kept that up for a while and when he finally quieted down we sent a fire team to recon the position and he was still breathing but had lost consciousness. 

It was suggested we put two rounds into his head to finish him off but a little argument broke out about that being against the rules because he was no longer a threat to us so we couldn't use lethal force because we'd already neutralized him. Being the Corpsman I brought up the fact that technically I have to render aid with equal standards to what he would receive from a local hospital. So we searched him for weapons and zip tied his hands behind his back and I put him in the 'recovery' position to make sure he had a patent airway and we left him there and moved on sweeping buildings.

Pretty sure he didn't make it. I really felt like just mercy killing him but didn't want to get prosecuted for war crimes or something because it had already been brought up by the Sargent that it was against our rules of engagement to kill someone who wasn't actively trying to kill us regardless if they were shooting at us 2 minutes before. 

Regardless what some people think and if Iraq returns to civil war and gets taken over by insurgents the Marines did what they were asked and served with honor. If the politicians want to give Iraq to the dogs it's no shame on the Marines, we left with our honor intact."

jakeycunt,pics,1390924313.0,"On the farm I live on, we keep the calfs right in sight of the cows. The cows race from the field to the milking parlour when its time for milking, literally galloping like a horse sometimes. And the cows give 20L when the calfs only really need about 2L a day, so the rest of the milk goes to cheese. Only one or two cows get 'depressed' out of the whole herd and these ones usually have a disability of some kind like a bad leg. Not really the forced to milk image you are giving.

Edit; and if the calfs were kept with the cows in the field, they would probably have a way higher death rate due to exposure and get killed by other animals, even other cows themselves. A warm barn with plenty of straw, and permanent access to calf feed and water/milk isn't too bad."

But my reaction to the idea that he left is that that should seem like an exceptional decision, and I definitely reject the idea put forward that bailing on an incident like this should be the default reaction throughout the world. There are countries and cities all over the place that have decent police forces, and there are plenty more whose police forces are at least decent enough that a major incident like this one would get half-proper treatment.

I think the question of obligation concerns what you need to weigh the consequences of leaving *against*. It's not just about debating medical treatment for the assailants. You are also talking about leaving dangerous criminal(s) on the street to prey on other people rather than standing up to testify and get them locked up. You're talking about wasting the resources of the community trying to figure out what happened, including the possibility of the surviving criminal(s) taking the opportunity to point blame somewhere else for their own reasons. And you're talking about contributing to the fear and insecurity that exists in a community where acts of violence happen without any lawful, open resolution. Among other problems.

The risk to you as a witness coming forward needs to be quite substantial and tangible in order for it to outweigh those obligations."

noc007,AdviceAnimals,1390924451.0,"Trash. Not filthy nastieness, but stuff that's clean to be played with and would otherwise by thrown out. Usually this is stuff that can go in the recycling bin anyways when its usefulness is fulfilled. When it becomes uninteresting or broken, throw it out. Stuff I have handed over: red Solo cup, junk mail, old magazines, paper packing material, beat up wipes container that's been replaced, glass soda bottles, plastic bottles, an old TDMA dumb phone that they can't dial 911 on, random plastic containers, scraps of fabric, rope I used to tie the wife up with back in the day, old wireless keyboard and mouse, various boxes from tissue to shipping boxes, and a multitude of other random things. A box that's new to them generally is hours of entertainment. As they get older, you can cut it up into stuff like a car or make a fort or a castle; **boxes are hours of fun**.

Few things to keep in mind. If you don't want a common thing to become ""their toy"", don't give it to them. Example: if the red solo cup is a commonly used in normal life or at parties as well as a toy, you're gonna have a bad time with them constantly going after legit drinks. For my offspring, plastic bags haven't been a problem, but we monitor the usage anyways.

Putting shit in their mouth is part of the texture and taste learning process. It's going to happen. If you don't want them to put it in their mouth, don't give it to them. If they're past that necessary learning stage and you're trying to teach them to not put shit in their mouth all the fucking time, just take it away when they start gnawing on it. Cardboard boxes can be hours of entertainment, but then they start eating the damn thing and it has to be taken away.

BTW, don't get caught up in the battery operated toys that make a lot of noise and flash. If you don't think it contributes to attention problems, yanking the batteries or not getting it will preserve your sanity. Just because it claims to be educational, doesn't mean they've got scientific data to back it up. This past Christmas my mom sent a toy that she probably found in some super budget section of Walmart that claimed to be educational; it's an obnoxious noise machine that only teaches noise and isn't that interesting after the batteries get pulled.

As they get older and stop trying to choke themselves on stuff, start checking out those toys in gumball machines. A quarter to 50 cents for a toy that they will play with just as long as a $50 toy is money well spent. Plus if it hurts to be stepped on or pisses you off for some reason, it's not a big deal to toss it out.

TL;DR Let other people spend the money on expensive toys. Give them stuff that would otherwise hit the recycling bin that can be tossed for any reason."

I could also use painter's tape to attach the label to the container, as sticky notes just don't work well for months.

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390924606.0,"I missed an ""if"" in your statement, apologies.

The type of commitment you make in a relationship is different than a friendship. In a romantic relationship, you agree to do certain things together, as companion, outside of the sexual arrangement. You commit whatever time the two of you agree. That is not how most friendships I know work. You do need to commit time and energy to keep friendships going, but it is not the same level of time or energy. It is not the same ""lets be partners in life"" dynamic.

I think that, for people who never pursue committed relationships, and have no desire for committed relationships, and are physically attracted to both genders, you could describe that as a kink.

But people who desire relationships, commit to relationships, and can do that for either gender, that is not just a kink. That is not just about fulfilling sexual desire, that is about experiencing life with someone else.  And that, I think, is what the orientation part is about.

YouBWrong,comicbookmovies,1390924684.0,"It really isn't enough to be a sci-fi dude.  Comic book fans are not into the genre because of all the pretty pictures of cool space ships etc.  They're into it because it's a medium that allows for the telling of much broader stories than you can get in movies or even in books.  What allows them to tell stories that extend over years and decades is the very rich characters who get more layered the longer you read.  The guys who write them are smart and inspired and they tell great stories.  The best thing that you can do as a director is to try and remain as true as possible to that source material.  

What Singer does instead is to come up with his own stories that are kind of mashed up versions of what he's seen or been told about form the comics.  That can actually lead to brilliant moments like Magneto pulling a submarine out of the water.  But still they are only echos of the great original stories.
